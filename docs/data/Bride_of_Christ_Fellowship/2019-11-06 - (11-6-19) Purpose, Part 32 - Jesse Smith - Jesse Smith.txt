our Bibles here tonight by God's grace like to go to mark chapter 16 verse 15 I like to preach on purpose part 32 tonight so mark 16:15 over the week and you heard me say that I felt like brother Simon picked up where I left off and I do feel like that we had some wonderful thoughts and a tremendous weekend of services and Lord willing I'm gonna listen to all those I listen to two of them already by God listen to more and I would I just kind of reiterate and maybe expound on the some of the thoughts that the Lord brought to us last weekend is such a tremendous wonderful weekend of the Word of God but I like to look at this thought tonight on purpose and then more willing we'll go into some more of the thoughts on Sunday Bible says and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he'd that believe that his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned now children us I'll read verse 17 he got it there let's read up on three one two three and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues are we to eighteen they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen I'll read one more scripture first Corinthians 12 27 I think everybody can hear me okay I already got a couple of texts from Amen and Hosea Thank You brothers for confirming that everything seems to be okay praise God now Lord willing we'll be looking at little more on gifts tonight kind of pick up where I left off and I want to just read this little portion of scripture because it again shows we read in mark 16 how these signs follow but then this text says not all the gifts not or each person does not receive all the gifts so kind of get brings man I get brings balance to what we read in mark 16 verse 27 now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God hath set some in the church so to our church we know and hopefully it'll be made real to you again tonight that God has set you in a certain position to do his will and to use the gifts that he gave you God has sent you to do some he's positioned you to do something first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healing helps government's diversities of tongues here's where I want to get to are all prophets I'm sorry are all apostles are me are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret of course we know the answer to all these questions is no but covet earnestly the best gifts are the gifts that edify the most people like wisdom knowledge prophecy and yet no more accurate way that's that one more word appending on your heart just make it honor to God here today showing us how word of Prayer inspiring it's Heavenly Father we thank you again for your mazing grace or take this word now break it to our hearts teach us from the message from the Bible from your prophet Lord God we love you so much we just want to stay right in tune with the Holy Spirit what I truly felt like Lord you've indicated everything you've led me to preach this year on purpose and supernatural and gifts and Lord you just have indicated it this weekend so thank you Lord for that teach us from here on out Lord and then move us Lord in the next class Lord that we can we can realize where you set us and what you've called us to do we know we're not called to do everything we can't do everything but we want to do exactly what you've called us to do teach us now I pray in Jesus Christ's name never said all right everybody may be seated by God's grace so we're so thankful for the testimonies sister Connie and brother Simon shared with us also Lord willing Sunday we'll look at some of the thoughts from last weekend and expound on him but also we'll show the the Trump video where he talks about 28 evangelical leaders coming to the White House and expressing tremendous unity churches starting to back the government and then we're willing on Sunday I'll just reiterate some of the quotes brother brand talked about the boycott where the government is going to boycott churches like ours when church is when the false churches unite with the government it'll cause a boycott brother ban said that happens when the spirit Falls so that we believe that to be the latter rain and so we don't know how close it is but it's just another sign that we're on the way and that the prophecy is right by God's grace so just real briefly the last few services we've been looking at the purpose we looked at program quote from works is faith expressed you must be learning more about our gifts or something's wrong so I'm like look at Malachi and Lydia and and if they're not learning more about piano after a while something's wrong or their guitar means they've lost interest in it that they've lost desire for and so it is for my life if I see healings in my life or if I see wisdom or knowledge or if you see speaking in tongues or prophesying or interpretation and if we don't see ourselves growing in these things something's wrong we've lost interest in them we've stopped praying about those things we've maybe somehow we've just got distracted with all the cares life and the duties of life which are good we have to do things but we can't let cares of life take a higher priority than the Word of God because jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things more about our gifts by the grace of the Lord then we saw how God's have got a variety some men are more prayer warriors some are more scholarly some are more firebrands some are more quiet some are more blusterous some are more dogmatic but God likes a variety of people some are more gentle and kind and then we were born to do something each person was born to do something for God like Samson was born to defeat beginning to defeat the Philistines Jesus was born to destroy death the Bible said and save us from our sins so each person was born to achieve some purpose some ministry then we were saw we saw how we were ordained by God to do something but were still be I mean that Moses wasn't always the meekest man but he became the meekest man and David wasn't always a man after God's own heart but he learned to grow to be a guy a man after God's own heart through obedience now I left off the court I left off was a quote brother Simon mentioned about he about brother branham saying he was going to give the people a little twister and I'll get to that in a little bit but it was a quote about signing crying for the abominations and I ended with that quote on the Sunday morning before last weekend so I want to read that entire quote that probably the longest quote I'll ever read as a pastor but it's such an important quote and as I meditated it and pray it prayed about it and read it over I thought I just got to read this whole quote so it's from questions and answers 64 part 3 if you want to listen to how to encourage you to listen to it but I just feel that I thought you know be a good time I'm on this topic we just had the vindication about the supernatural and getting in the spirit on bringing back the Ark bringing back revival I thought it would be important to read this entire quote so it's question number 328 in the co D and I'll just be stopping and making comments and trying to balance out with other quotes I've been preaching over the years and then if you want those quotes you know feel free to email me or text me or call me or whatever leave me a voicemail and I can get back to you so here's the question says brother Branham is it possible for one to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not have the signs following at least not until some future time and conditions appointed by the spirit now that's a beautiful question brother Graham says that he says now that might sound like a mixed up question but that's a good one very good he gives me a little chance I find that's working with my family here now I mean you my family and the family out in the world where our tapes go so see we're part of a band of spiritual family he's got now a great part of my congregation is made up of Pentecostal people because Pentecost is the latest message that we have in the denominational ranks and to me I certainly agree with them more than any other denominational Church I hang towards the Pentecost so because it's the later message and all my converts that I bring to Christ I try to direct them to some Pentecostal church but I have condemned them in every way that I note how that they were wrong in the scripture by being a denomination and not willing to walk in light when lights presented to them yet if I had to take my choice today to take any Church in the world I take Pentecostal when it comes to denomination but when it comes to individuals as men and women there's genuine Christians and all them denominations Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Luther's but I'm talking about the systems that these people and not never the individual but the system that these people has been caught into their denomination they clearly understand now if the Roman Catholic Jehovah's Witness Orthodox Jew whatever they are that doesn't matter to me but they're individuals to which Christ died to save so brother Brahim here is very kind to anyone who's outside his type of church and realizing that these are souls that Christ died to save let me just say you know the the if we're gonna point someone to denomination today we would point into the latest message I would even go maybe a step further and say poem to a oneness Pentecostal church right because they have even more truth they know that God's not three persons but at least they believe in the supernatural and being baptized in the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ or at least Jesus at least they believe in healings now though many of them of course do the tongues is evidence but that's still you're getting more bread you're getting more word than you would at a denominational church that doesn't believe in supernatural or doesn't believe the gifts of the Spirit or believes God is three persons now he says neck's he says I believe there's just as many Christians out there in the baptist as there are the Methodists or the presbyterian or whatever more there are Christians real believers now this is 1964 after the seals he says there's real believers and denominations and right out in the Roman Catholic Church there's genuine people in there that's real men and women that love the Lord they don't join that church to be wrong they join that to be right but it's a system in there that directs their mind the wrong way and it ever comes to a time I'd make a denomination I've deceived you and brought you into a system he said far be it from me and may God keep me in the right mind to direct you to Jesus Christ the word stay with that that's what we are that's what message churches are we're not denomination no one lords over me no one tells me what to preach except the Holy Spirit and so we're free from all denomination and we're staying with Jesus Christ the word now that's programs intro to answer the question now he gets to the question but now this person here is asking the question about the possibility of having the baptism of Holy Ghost without signs following them now watch this answer this is quite a long but beautiful answer and you'll see how he deals with it he tries to bring the balance to it because all Christians should have signs following them at some point but brother Graham never says when he says but we should be growing into that we should be growing an understanding and power a growing and obedience growing in submission and for us that means growing in prayer growing and more obedience to the Word of God he says if you're born again see if you're born first as a human being a normal human being he says you'll actually do the things that are normal human being would do so but man uses a natural example to help us understand the spiritual you're born again the Holy Ghost you'll be a Holy Ghost fell believer if you're born again of a mother right in the natural way you'll be yo new natural things a child or young young infant us he says if you're born as a human the natural traits of a human being will follow you you won't live in a tree and try to fly with wings like a bird or something like that that wouldn't be in a normal human being normal human being would to work to marry have family do these things that's natural normal human beings because you're born that then when you're born to Christian born in the Spirit of God you naturally take up the attributes of Christ he said if we took here this morning in this congregation where you people sit here and listen day after day and so forth to the teaching you'll find out you'd be different for another because you're different you're makeup different your appetites are different you eat different but you all eat food one individual just like the other one you're different one from another Christians do the same thing now you can't say now all he said do all speak with tongues do all prophesy see why I use that scripture when we started see you have to watch these things because a Christian just takes up the habits of a Christian and they live like a Christian Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe that's my other text for tonight praise God notice in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall take up serpents and drink if they drink any deadly things and not hurt them they'll speak with new tongues then things just actually follow Christians now the person has a very good thing here so by man that says it's a very good question because it's talking about timing timing in your life he said or do we wait unto the future time or the conditions appointed by the Holy Spirit well the man said I like that now you get the idea when it's appointed by the Holy Spirit God points things so apparently God appoints miracles and God appoints all the gifts of the Holy Spirit he said there if if the Pentecostal people would try to listen this tape you'll understand me if you'll get here why different with you pressing the idea that they must all speak with tongues I cannot see that right he said I like cherry pie but there's no need and I'm a human being there's no need of me trying to tell you if you don't eat cherry pie you're not a human being see but eating cherry pie is just one of the habits of the human being you might disagree with me upon that but it's true now one will eat this and the one will do something else now the Holy Spirit appoints these offices but when you try to force yourself into it so now he's going to get down tongues people that have the tongues speaking doctor and they're trying to they're trying to force the idea that God set them to speak with tongues but remember the Bible said God sets you in your position he says but what if I said you had to eat cherry pie but cherry pie made you vomit and he said see you're hurting yourself and that's the way you try to do when you try to force yourself to do something that's contrary to the cherry to the spirit he's got your life lotted for a certain thing that we can all should all shout Amen on that on the shout amen amen God has given you a certain lot in life you're supposed to do a certain thing you have a certain lot a certain gift you're supposed to do you can't force yourself to try to do something you have to get under the anointing of the Spirit Ram taught earlier man taught us and can preach it first get in prayer so you can get under the spirit and then when you're in the spirit God will give you revelation revelation of your gift but you got to pray first pray for revelation and then when you're in that spirit of revelation God will show you his will God will show you your gifts he said in when your with the spirit here's one of the best sides I know of of the evidence of the Holy Ghost he says you're so in love with Christ and believe every word that he says to be the truth that's the evidence that you have the Holy Spirit and your life's full of joy oh my everything is different than what he used to be that's the Holy Spirit now these are the gifts in the Spill Holy Spirit now if every person in here was imperfectly harming with harmony with the Holy Spirit every one of you was filled with the Holy Ghost and in harmony with the Holy Ghost these signs would just be multiplying among you all the time it'd just be constantly going now cam mentioned this quote earlier this weekend I thought it was inspired so see cam and Simon not even realized what they were doing we're hitting on the same quote I was getting to before I got to it so that's why I wanted to get to it tonight by God's grace so see that's why it's important you know for our church you know any church if people say they're born again the Holy Ghost they got to live right we got to keep ourselves from the cares of the world a lust of the flesh part of life all these things if we do that then we'll see the gifts of the Spirit multiplying or growing in our life it's hard to do brother Ram said it's the hardest thing for a preacher or any church to do is stay under the anointing of the Holy Spirit so that we can see God moved through gifts and signs and supernatural manifestations of the Holy Spirit he said but where there's confusion where there's difference where we set up the Holy Spirit can't move itself you can't see it can't operate through the people and if I said now each of you did you speak with tongues yeah well you got it did you speak with tongues no you haven't got it he said now I'm making myself a judge God is the judge of these things so see what denominations have done whether it's oneness Pentecostal trataron Pentecostal anyone who has the tongues as evidence doctrine has made themselves the judge and they're judging something that they can't see they can't know like I've told you this I had a good college friend who in college he he joined a oneness pentecostals search he got married to one of the girls in the church and they spoke with tongues all the time I went to a couple of their services they spoke tongues that throughout the song service after the preaching and all the time they're speaking in tongues and they all said they had the Holy Ghost well my friend got into this insurance business he stopped spending time with his wife she got better she went and committed adultery had an affair and they broke up and they got divorced and moved on to other people now obviously those people were never born again but their church and their denomination their Creed tried to judge them and say yes you're born again you're sealing the kingdom of God but we know if Christ gets sealed into you all those sin major sins like that will be sealed out we know that because that's what the Bible says if you're a part of the kingdom of God you won't commit adultery fornication homosexuality thieves and all these things all these major sins the Bible talks about in Galatians 5 and 1st Corinthians 6 but that's one clear common example that I can show how that false doctor makes a person a judge and they're judging something they don't even understand they can't even see right even you and I in one case brother Branham says he said you'll never know if a person is born again the Holy Ghost and then another quote he said you can tell in five minutes if they're born again with the Holy Ghost so there's quotes on both sides so we're not really sure but the main thing to do is look for fruits jesus said by their fruits you know them now fruits obviously only come the real fruits of the Holy Spirit only come from people who have been serving God a long time and are born again that's how you see fruits of the Holy Spirit so we know in order to really have a good feeling if someone is born again you've got to give it a lot of time they got to be a faithful witness they got to have time-tested memorials praise God amen so now Baron says but watch Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe the groups that believe I like this now the whole nature of the Holy Spirit flows through them and they're full of love and joy and a great bundle of real godly filled people that's the Holy Spirit and in there they speak with tongues on the occasion that tongues arise why or necessary for that they speak with tongues if there's a prophecy it speaks and oh it's just exactly perfect every time to see we all of us have to get in harmony with the Holy Ghost and see if we have the gift of prophecy in our church like we said it may come through dreams may come through something just spoken out loud we don't know how it'll come but we want to be in harmony with the Holy Spirit in case god does wondering for tell us the future then Brennan talked about how he had 15 interviews before this service and everything came out perfectly through the discernment so that was another vindication that the Holy Spirit is perfectly right every time the Holy Spirit dig right down in there get them things and bring them out and tell it to them see there's no mistakes to it tells it just exactly what this and what that was and what it what that is and what is to be done things like that what they should do set it right in order now they've got to act on that the other night I was talking to a couple at a home he's having a meeting talking around the table and all once the Holy Spirit dropped among us so what I watched this this is something we can grow as a church to brother Mannis fill with the Holy Spirit right he's got the oyster right here but yet he felt the Holy Spirit drop down in the room okay so see it shows there's you can feel the Holy Spirit in another realm you can feel the Holy Spirit and your flesh you can feel the Holy Spirit in your mind anointing your mind where he just brings a thought to you right you working through your conscious memory reason affection imagination so see you can be filled with the Holy Ghost and feel the Holy Ghost come down in the room praise God so programs are the host and I said I see a certain man here the vision he's confused in his mind about some things and I said now it's right here now I said I know what you're thinking and he said he went back and a roundabout way and answered every question the man had in his mind and nobody know what my man was talking about except the man that he discerned in that room so he said it was showing to him that the Holy Spirit was revealing to me what was on his mind and I didn't have to tell it to the rest of the man's listen at me right now so someone right there in the tabernacle confirmation now if the whole church would work in harmony like that then among us we'd be casting out Devils taking up serpents drinking deadly things all kinds of things going on so that's why we should strive for harmony get our lives in harmony or pleasing to the holy spirit as brother can talk walking in the spirit is denying sin denying our fleshly lusts so if we come to church like that if we come to church denying our fleshly lust denying ourselves and coming with the anointing like we talked about then we're gonna see more of the sort of God move amongst us but he said when you try to force that on individuals that's Pentecost so again like the tongues when you try to force tongues on someone that's Pentecostal then you got Babylon confusion you can't judge that our hearts he said our hearts are full of joy and happiness all my the birds are saying everything is wonderful not just full the Spirit of God we're so in love with Jesus we want to pray all night now would it no I wouldn't embarrass this crowd he says or even my cell but I wonder if I could ask this morning which one in this crowd and this people had the Holy Ghost probably 95 percent would raise their hands that they had the Holy Ghost then I turn around and give you a Bible evidence just one now here's a good quote that proves there's more than one evidence of the Holy Ghost right the evidence of the Holy Ghost is living the word for your day but what we mean by that there's more than one scripture about different things you'll do if you're born again you're gonna sigh and cry you're gonna have the fruits of the spirit you're gonna pay your tithe you're gonna go to church you're gonna live a clean life you're not gonna cuss and swear you're not gonna commit adultery you're gonna live a chaste pure life so that's what he's saying here it's a good quote for that he says he said I doubt whether one or two hands would go up he says but you've got to get your church out of that baby hood and get them into manhood okay now he goes into this thought about how people in his church were name calling people from another Church I think about that even brother Branham Church had people that were carnal that didn't like people from other churches and would name call them call them deadbeats that's what the quote says so there was people in Brannon tabernacled name calling other churches and call them dead beans like they're dead Christians it was actually brother junior Jackson's congregation and the reason they were calling him dead beans was because brother Jackson let them speak with tongues in the church service but brother Branham didn't want that he wanted the tongues interpretation in a room before the church service he says well that's brother Jackson's shirt that's perfectly all right I haven't got nothing against that jr. Jackson is one of my best friends a real godly man filled with the Spirit of God he don't have to eat my cherry pie he says I don't have to eat his apple pie but we're both eating pie we both believe this message exactly so c-minor doctrines like how to operate the gifts but apparently to brother Branham didn't represent what the message was the message was the full restoration of the Word of God on these major doctrines on these major mysteries right because he said yes how you operate the gifts isn't part of the message that they believe exactly he says that's the order the church I want my church to try to come together and come in the now I'm gonna skip a little bit but come in the room before the service and pray before the service all right now he says let the tongues go on he said for a while and then let the word be presented on it then watch it if it's the Holy Spirit it copes right with the word if it doesn't it won't so in other words let people speak in tongues he says but if it gets wrong bring the word and try to correct it if the person obeys the word than it then they're there right with the Holy Spirit the person disobeys the correction they're not right with the Holy Spirit he said if it's the Holy Spirit it'll just meekly follow right in line because that's what it is it's the Holy Spirit going right to its own order he said brother Graham said now was speaking in tongues I wish every one he spoke with tongues I sure do and he says many times good Christians now he's talking about an interview he had I think it was with sister Bruce he said this person the genuine person her for me say the evidence of the whole eastcoast wasn't speaking in tongues and it isn't but I advised that person to ask God to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy because it's in their nature so Graham saw someone the church who really wanted know if they had the Holy Ghost and so he prayed ask God God we let them speak in tongues of prophesy because this person their mind they needed that in order to feel like they were born again in church if you feel that same way it's okay to do that I mean everybody needs everybody needs a sign Pope's you can put down and a spot where you say I believe I received the Holy Ghost at that moment Thomas remember time is desire I just want to put my hands and his side I just want to touch his feet and God was merciful and gave it to him and we were not going to criticize Thomas because we've all had our doubts we some of us maybe still doubt but we got to be honest enough with Jesus and ask him and like Gideon put a fleece out before the Lord and see if God will answer there's nothing wrong with that even for the children okay to get down into business with God get serious with God ask God say God if you do this then this means this and if you don't do that it means this but makes you write it down makes you remember make sure you're serious enough enough about it you have enough business with God that's enough honestly with God that you'll do what he's asking you do or you'll do what you you say and promise God you'll do okay now then brother Graham goes into interviews and how he'll he'll look under which sign astronomy sign a person was born under when he's counseling with that I'm not gonna get much into that I'd like to study that maybe at some point and get into that later but I'm not ready to preach on that right now all right so he says don't let Satan stand anywhere in your mind so don't let him make you doubt he says that's his duty to stand there and pound at you like that but don't you listen to him so church if you have any doubts in your life go to God and prayer get serious with God ask God for a sign fast and pray read your Bible more read scriptures talk to me whatever you need to do find a gifted person ask me about a gifted person I know that may be able to help you but don't let Satan pound you and keep you defeated by doubt right we shouldn't live lives of doubt we should live lives of faith right lives of hope remember walking in the spirit is life and peace a camera that scripture from Romans the Holy Spirit is joy life and peace not doubt and discouragement and fear and frustration right so we got to go to God and ask him to minister to us and help us to get out of doubt if we're doubting but Rahab said but I told that person if I could just be sure if having the Holy Ghost a dandy person but man said a real loyal person I told her it'd be good for her to say father just give me this for something to stand on that's what I'd used in my life like I always tell people I got the Holy Ghost a day after my wedding which I'm still claiming that because like a week later a preacher was preaching on it and I was really battling in my mind whether to go up to pray for the Holy Ghost or not but I just decided that moment Lord I'm gonna believe right now I have to I got the Holy Ghost for something supernatural happened to me that day I never felt like that before and I prayed and said God if it's if that wasn't the Holy Ghost prove it let me see it my life that my life would fail but my life never failed it always got closer to God so that's what every person has to do right every person has to sent down a snake and say I'm gonna believe that if my life doesn't tally up to God's Word after that and that wasn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what brother Graham says every person has to do that now recently I've talked to a few people that told me they wanted to be remapped or they had to be reburied at rebaptised a second or third time and we've always found that to be a good thing because if there's any doubt in your mind it's a good idea to go back and make sure if you want to be rebaptised repent of your sins seek God fast and pray do whatever you need to do in order to know that you're truly saved well you're you're truly serving God with all your heart this time if there's any doubt you were before this will eliminate it because you saw God you pray you talk to me your pastor you're ready to solve all doubts right like the Bible says the Holy Spirit will dissolve all doubts so I've we found recently I've talked to different ones one in Albion and went over there now another one was from a few years ago my brother cams church someone felt led to do that and they've got victory ever since they've been very faithful ever since so you found that to be a good thing it's Satan's job to pound you with doubt and fear and an anger and unbelief or new questions but it's our job to get so close to God that we draw nigh to God that God gets so nice to us he gives us some experience and then from that experience we just hold on to that as our evidence that was the time God surely did something in my life and then we just stay in harmony with the Holy Spirit afterwards amen now brother Branham says now the reason he doesn't teach everybody to seek tongues or prophesy like this woman he says it like this he says now if I taught it like that to everybody people would reach out and get a hold of that tongue or prophesy without having the character that this person's got so this woman had a real godly character but man thought she had the Holy Ghost but he wouldn't advise everybody to do that who was doubting about the Holy Ghost only someone with real godly holy ghost character would he advised to seek some manifestation the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Ghost does speak with tongues but you got to have the Holy Ghost first before it can speak with tongues now do you get it he says he said now that could be a genuine gift that could be the Holy Ghost speaking in you with unknown tongues he said and you could be lost and go to hell same thing with a miracle you can do a miracle but then be lost and go to hell the Bible says so and it's been then bro Graham quotes 1st Corinthians 13 you can speak with tongues right you can move mountains you got mountains of faith and still have not love it profits you nothing you don't get any closer to God because it's just an outward anointing on the the flesh or on the human sphere but not in the soul of man he says I'm Paul says I'm nothing unless the other goes with him so unless love goes with the gifts were nothing he says you have to have this love first so don't reach out after that gift without this get this first love and then that will actually follow it amen now the rain falls on the just and the unjust the Sun shines on the wicked the good the rainy follows to ripen the crop it ripens the weed also the same rain the Holy Spirit can fall in a group of people speak in tongues and make it exactly true sprawling amongst the people make a prophesy and be exactly true but sometimes a witch or medium they can say something that's exactly the right right but the Witch of Endor to solve mine it could be exactly true this still isn't it they're witches they're speaking in tongues I've seen devil speak with tongues writing on no tongues that don't mean anything but the real thing is that word again back to that word in other words living the word no matter what manifestation no matter what you can produce supernaturally whatever supernatural miracles we've got to get back to living the word praise God he said you can do all these gifts without the word when you get the word it does it then watch it just exactly come to pass exactly the right thing then you're in exactly in line yes the Holy Spirit uses these people as it's appointed by his own wisdom he said but the first thing is now what now let me give you a little twister here just a minute this is the quote I wanted to read lat two Sundays ago and the Sunday morning service I didn't have time for him he said let me give you a twister here how many here has the Holy Ghost he said all of you raise up your hand I say all right I'll see if you have the Bible said they that had the Holy Ghost sighed and cried day and night for the abominations done the city now how many hands would go up praise God how many of you can't rest at night so full of joy the power of God and so sad for the people that's lost that day and night you weep and cry for the abominations see who would that be in the city how many is that's in the church that's what the Bible said the Holy Spirit evidence was he told the sealing a John Ezekiel 9 right Simon preach in on Friday nights the hours it was all tied together I feel like it was just a continuation of the thought he said go through the city and set a mark upon those who sign cry for the abominations the rest of them left the destroying angel destroy them no matter how much church members they was how many things they done a man with an income Rider dressed in white which represented the Holy Spirit came forth and put a mark on all them that side and cried for an abomination ton the city and watch what he said they're also slay utterly little children all women babies come on he's a little children yes when Joshua entered the land of Canaan don't let one of them live he says remember the little ones they grow up to be an Amalekite he'll pollute the camp when those little things come back like that disagree with the Word of God get rid of that thing so so you know the judgment upon little ones in the Old Testament was a shadow of what we should do we should not let any little sin rise up in our lives he said it looks cute it looks innocent it looks like it's all right but don't have anything to do with it you stay away from it you just remember any Amalekite anything that denies the word stay away from it have nothing to do with it how many believe that's the truth sure it is stay away from it then he guys goes back to zq9 who sighs and cries for abomination that's in the city where do you see that okay so think about that think of all the church service do you bend the different Church of you been where have you seen people sigh and cry for all the evils done in their family or their City now you see it from time to time but there's not a whole lot of it right he said I can show you 10,000 people speaking in tongues to one that's really burden for sin so the RAM says like 10,000 to one you see people that will speak in tongues or shout or for us you know clap or scream 10,000 those for one person that's really burden for sin he said that can't even pray an hour so that's why I did those our prayers because I wanted to start getting the church but after that we got to get our churches out of babyhood in the manhood so we had 4 hours of prayer that I scheduled for those who could make it and wanted to be a part of it 4 hours of Prayer because that this quote is what I had in my mind but man have sent someone that's really mature in Christ was sigh and cry and pray sometimes more than an hour so when does the church and my family to start learning and start seeing how we got to be more sincere should we get to Christ the more we're gonna love his spirit and more we're gonna hate sin and the more it's gonna make us sad when we see people not serve God okay he said but did you know the Bible said mark only those who sighed and cried for the domination than the city sure that's the Holy Spirit come forth to mark the people and the mark of God is the Holy Ghost the seal of God amen and I'm almost done here with this quote here and it's almost I think about an hour since I've been preaching here so this quote takes a long time to read here now where are some people that's that that's that interested I can hear you people that jump up and down and cry in the church I can show you people that shout ran all over the building I can show you people that prophesied comes the past I can show you those who speak with tongues we're up and down the buildings and say things that actually interprets comes the past but where's that person that sighs in Christ for the abominations that's done the city now we're at a time today where we don't see a lot of the other ones either we don't see a lot of speaking in tongues and crying and we don't see a lot of people running around the church our church is so small but you can still run around it so see that's because the Bible said at the end time because iniquity abounds the love of many shall wax cold so see how Nick witty tries to get into our lives and into our church is so influencing all of us and we gotta we got to get rid of any iniquity get rid of any sin and live in harmony to the Holy Spirit it's gonna be a great challenge but greater is He that's in us and he that's in the world from Anderson where's that burden soul he said you could turn some new leaves on that see what I mean so that or the RAM Carter the twister he said how many got the only ghost 95% he said now let me give you a proof who's who's signing crying for abominations and he said that would turn a new leaf well at some point we got to turn a new leaf right at some point we've got to grow up and I believe God will bring us to that maturity as the rapture gets closer it has to because the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride that's thus saith the Lord we got to have the same desires they had in the book of Acts we got to live the same life have the same love for Jesus the same zeal for Christ he said I tried my best to tell you people and lead you like a daddy with his children you're my children I'd be getting begotten you to Christ through the gospel that I preach I want to raise up fully matured kids or children now I want to present you to Christ that day as Paul said a chaste virgin that's anger things 11 there isn't a thing in that word but what your heart will punctuate amen to it see we've got to get to the spot Archer says get this where we don't have to have special meetings to want to come early and pray before service that's a burden on my heart that's what I want to see other people do where we're just growing up into Christ that we we so desperately want harmony in our church that every church service is important every church service is special so we're going to come and pray and get our hearts and harmony with the Holy Spirit so we can see God moving among us multiplying among us and manifesting is great power among us now of course you'll do things wrong so here's where he brings the balance yes where our lives are full of joy we're happy we're so we're praying sine cry for dominations but then he says of course she'll do things wrong but when the other the first thing that condemns you you'll say Father forgive me so we got a we got to grow in quick repentance right where daddy for my children daddy doesn't have to correct you you'll hear the Holy Spirit say you need to make that right or you'll feel it right and for me that my wife doesn't have to bring something to my attention that I'll hear the Holy Spirit say Oh Jesse that's not right go say you're sorry see we we have to grow a woman that to be more sensitive to the harmony of the sphere of God brother Evan gives an example of this sensitivity to the Holy Spirit he saw a young boy a teenager he was hunting with recently and he says we was hunting squirrels a fine boy that morning I got five I left one of them for that afternoon you only get six in the state of Kentucky that's the limit says so that certain person said I got nine the limit was six but this young boy got nine and I said you've done wrong you did wrong see I said well I had five that morning I say one for the afternoon when I got that one squirrel looked in a tree and kind of five or six of them sitting right there where I could look at them walked out and left them I said I walked up in a tree here not long ago and there was about 15 or 20 sitting there I just took the limit and walked away I let the rest of them there so but brother time just gives a simple example he's choosing to obey the limit of the hunting season the legal limit he's choosing to obey the law the young boy didn't but he was obeying he said you did wrong my breaketh in the law because was sensible holy spirit he says and I said if I come to this country and preach to you boys and you people hear that that's right I've got to live that example now listen Christianity ain't what you say it's what you live what you do it's an example you're the salt of the earth amen so see no matter what people say in our church when we talked about to church before church during church it doesn't matter what people say it's what people live right it's what people do with their actions my man said then he told the boy the law says Jesus Christ said give them to Caesar what belongs to Caesar you break the speed laws there what are you doing you're doing wrong you sinned give Caesar what Caesar's and God what's God so even to driving over the limit you gotta be careful with that say well that's laws wrong I can't help what what's wrong it is it's wrong to break Jesus commandment if you don't give Caesar the thing that Caesars then you did what Jesus told you not to do and the transgression of the law is sin that's right we're all guilty we do it but when you see yourself wrong stop it in other words stop sinning it's not breaking the law people are watching you people won't go to church but they'll read you and see what you do I'm almost done you're almost just too two more paragraphs here so get Christ in your heart Christ and the Holy Spirit's the same thing the Holy Spirit Christ means The Anointed One and the Holy Spirit is that anointing and you are the one that's anointed it's Christ and you anointing you see what I mean then you've got the right thing then he can use you to anything he wants to use you in because you're in the body and subject to any of those gifts but see to have one of the gifts outside the body it would do you no good that's why we say always seek the baptism Holy Ghost first make sure you're born again first and then after that live in such harmony with Christ until you can wait until it's God time to use you for a certain gift it equals first Corinthians thirteen again if I give my body to be burned without love it profits me nothing he says although I give all my goods to feed the poor I fake to move Mountain had nothing see don't depend on those things the gifts the holy spirits of being it's God it's gotten you the person God that's lit your whole entire being your change you're a new creature any little thing that's wrong he'll tell you what's wrong then quit don't do it father I didn't mean to do that you forgive me see that's the Holy Spirit see we can recognize the Holy Spirit clearly when he's trying to correct our lives and get us to repent from the wrong that we may have done I don't care how much Antone's how much you run how much you jumped how much you did this that or the other whenever you done it wouldn't mean a thing if the Holy Spirit wasn't in there to condemn you on the things that's right and wrong so well Holy Spirit will condemn you on thing that's wrong now that's the reason this person hears right let the Holy Spirit do it what signs miracles wonders let the Holy Spirit do the supernatural through you but now you see what's causing this let me say with love sprinkled with love and anoint do with the word if the genuine Holy Spirit was in you you wouldn't question that you know it yourself it's an individual thing between you and God you know that some things happened you know that there's a change whether anything else you yourself you're the change you're the one that's done the changing inside of you and you know you have it whether you spoke with tongues whether you jump see you said jumping you might jump when you get the bat Suzanne holy ghost shouted or anything else you know that God lives in you that you don't walk with your own mind it's the mind of Christ that leads you with the word just exactly the way it goes let me add something real quick from God's from God high up within simplicity from Albuquerque New Mexico at the end of that sermon brother Graham saw the Holy Spirit baptize people the Holy Ghost and one of them he said the woman had her hands down and he said she was praying the Holy Ghost Baptizer in her soul brother Anderson all she did she shot her hands up in the air started praising God that's all she did and she had a chequered colored dress on you can look that up in the message so he says you might speak in tongues you might jump you might shout you might just throw your hands up and start praising God it doesn't really matter what you do you'll do something emotional right because on the day of Pentecost I thought they were drunk we've never seen a drunk person you sit there and just not and do nothing like a drunk person acts drunk there aren't they look like they're out of control when the Holy Ghost comes upon you you look like you're out of control praising God jumping shouting raising your hands crying screaming something prophesy falling down something will happen where someone would think you're drunk a sinner would think you're drunk all right now it says in G no we said what if people say well then brother brandy you don't believe we ought to speak with tongues see then you get exactly backwards what I just said so my brother said yes it's okay to speak with others as long as you got the Holy Ghost first and as long as you line that gift up with the Word of God sure I believe you should speak with tongues but you get the e see I get these back here this 1500 month okay nice talking about other questions people don't understand from the questions and answer series he says but if you don't understand it then ask me write it to me if you don't understand see just just what I say I I say here Paul said follow me as I follow Christ and what his brother Graham's what is this brother man's example he says take everything back to the Word of God take the gifts back to the Word of God take your life back to the Word of God take everything back to the Word of God he said you see then then you see I'm wrong then get away from me see because I'd be the wrong person see all right no I just want to read one more scripture proverbs 4 verse 20 my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings so we've got a really listen to the Word of God even the sermon deny and the sermons were last weekend every sermon let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life okay so in other words gifts are gonna flow out of your heart if gifts are going to flow out of your life if keep all this word that we've heard in front of our eyes keeping it in our hearts see we stay under that harmony stay in that anointing then the life of God will flow out of us the Bible said we keep our hearts with all diligence okay god bless you we'll close with a word of Prayer here now I want to come to the piano and worship the Lord a little bit I trust that was a blessing like I said that's the longest quote I think I've ever done as a pastor but it was so important see cam brought that up Simon brought that up and didn't even know I was reading that to me that's a very inspired quote because it brings a perfect balance on the on gifts and when they happen they happen at the timing that God wants them to happen but they happen more if we were more in harmony with the Holy Spirit so we got to keep that in mind too and we got to grow up out of babyhood into manhood or to womanhood into adulthood with our gifts but we can't just be a baby with miracles we can't be a baby with divine healing or a baby with knowledge or tongues or prophecy or interpretation we can't be a baby with that we got to grow up and recognize sin keep sin out of our lives draw closer to God meditate on the things of God keep God's Word in our heart and then out of our heart will flow out the issues of life the gifts and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit all right we love you God blessed us that word of Prayer here one day father we thank you for your mercy love thank you for this word Lord we read your prophets quote but he keeps quoting the work or a lot of these scriptures we know but we need to hear the Prophet bring balance to it he's challenging us he's challenging your bride his church at that time and now he's challenging our church come out of babyhood into manhood snorlock pray for your people jesus christ name they overcome doubt may they overcome fear you give them a experience Lord God that they can have a signpost planted at that experience move on remember that's where they met God may we keep these truths are in front of our eyes and our hearts that through out of our hearts the flow the operation of the Holy Spirit we can start to see these things operating and multiply thank you for the healings of speaking Lord and make you Lord for the testimonies heard this week this name of the Lord greatly to be praised live let us stay in harmony by the holy spirit correct us we know if we're confessing our sins we know that's the whole spirit we know we walk in the spirit you work investing seeds and we're obeying the Word of God but sure people will get that wisdom understanding and growth that is murder tonight that is rhodonite no sir to you in Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

dude the decide crime let us have the joy this is hear the birds singing god those have a full christian experience because we're walking in the holy spirit is the whole of the Christian life just want to love you much more than we do I shoot live a bride was the Saints here not know Jesus Christ intersect I wish you a wonderful night in the God's wings [Music]
