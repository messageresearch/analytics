[1:04] forgive our sins so we know we're coming
[1:05] with confidence God that you'll speak to
[1:06] us here tonight and help us here tonight
[1:08] Lord Jesus Lord take these scriptures
[1:10] break them to us just as you did Lord in
[1:13] that house after uh the walk to Aus Lord
[1:16] God you broke the bread in a way that
[1:18] only you could do it may you speak in a
[1:19] way that only you can speak that it
[1:21] won't be well I remember what brother
[1:22] Jesse said but Lord the people would
[1:24] remember what the holy spirit said
[1:26] father God I'm asking you to do it Lord
[1:28] God I need you to do it father
[1:30] God we just uh come here at our post of
[1:32] Duty Lord as you taught us to do Lord be
[1:35] faithful Lord God in season out of
[1:37] season whether we feel like it or not we
[1:39] must be faithful in every season and we
[1:41] ask God that you minister to us Lord we
[1:43] surely feel like being here tonight I
[1:44] surely feel like preaching Lord God so I
[1:46] feel like I'm in season Hallelujah and
[1:49] so father take your word now and uh
[1:51] speak to your people that we can see a
[1:53] change in our lives in Jesus Christ's
[1:55] name and the Saints said amen amen God
[1:57] bless you as you're being seated
[2:01] a couple of wonderful testimonies you
[2:02] know from Sunday talked to brother
[2:04] Austin he had a really good testimony
[2:05] about the services there um so I really
[2:09] appreciated that and thankful to see
[2:11] what the Lord did you know down in
[2:12] Junction City I preed on uh the mystery
[2:15] of the church as the bride and a married
[2:17] couple had think they told my wife that
[2:19] they've been talking about that all week
[2:21] what is the bride and what is how do we
[2:23] uh how do we understand the bride I went
[2:25] and preach an entire sermon on it so it
[2:28] was really wonderful to see that
[2:30] and then we had some good questions
[2:31] afterwards uh I'll might share some of
[2:33] them here tonight if I kind of get to
[2:34] those um just some nice nice nice
[2:37] questions like about lot and uh the
[2:40] other one was about the three places you
[2:41] might go after death you know what are
[2:43] those three places of course that's for
[2:46] Sinners it's the uh the prison in the
[2:48] heart of the earth and then uh the sixth
[2:49] Dimension Under The Altar and then
[2:51] there's no doubt some saints in the
[2:52] seventh Dimension it's the 24 Elders you
[2:56] you know are at the Throne of God so
[2:58] there's at least three places we we
[2:59] could possibly go uh by God's grace
[3:02] brother goes beyond the curtain of time
[3:03] and he says he went to the sixth
[3:04] Dimension right or that place under the
[3:07] Altar and so uh we have that proof there
[3:10] so that's really good it's some
[3:11] excellent questions and uh real good
[3:15] Fellowship so uh it was a wonderful time
[3:17] in the Lord I just want to briefly
[3:19] review you know we looked at uh motions
[3:20] last week and I appreciate you know
[3:21] numerous people said they enjoyed it so
[3:23] I was really happy about that um by
[3:26] God's grace but I I love to me I love
[3:29] see Jesus's emotions I love seeing that
[3:32] because uh recently you know I was
[3:33] accused of not showing the love of
[3:35] Christ and maybe being a little angry
[3:37] but the Bible says you can be angry and
[3:39] sin not and that's what I felt like you
[3:41] know was happening in my life after
[3:43] prayer reflection you know I can only
[3:45] look at my life and and look at the
[3:47] fruits of my life praise God but uh we
[3:49] can have that we can have anger and sin
[3:51] not and Jesus did that when people had
[3:53] hard Hearts he would look at them in
[3:56] anger because he knew the conditions of
[3:58] their heart and so for me you know I see
[4:00] people I've I've worked with for years
[4:02] or maybe i' I've commented with people
[4:04] for weeks on end and I can see uh their
[4:07] attacks I can see where they come from
[4:09] and I feel like the Holy Spirit shows me
[4:11] that they have a hard heart right
[4:13] through their words right or lack of
[4:15] words uh and so that's when I may I may
[4:18] speak harsh words but if I know I'm
[4:21] right I I know the words right then I I
[4:22] know where I'm standing praise God and
[4:25] so Jesus you experienced uh anger uh and
[4:28] then we saw how brother brand said his
[4:30] main emotion was weeping so if you
[4:33] around Jesus a lot like his disciples
[4:35] the most common thing you would see him
[4:36] do is not shouting Glory Glory it was
[4:39] crying he'd be crying and in sorrow
[4:42] think about it think about all the
[4:43] stories you know the disciples can't
[4:45] cast out the devil and he's like oh
[4:47] faithless generation he's in the boat
[4:49] and they can't cast they can't rebuke
[4:51] the storm and he says oh where's your
[4:54] faith right here's a man he's a perfect
[4:57] man right but we see we see we see God's
[5:00] heart through Jesus brother R said Jesus
[5:02] is I'm sorry Jesus is the heart of God
[5:05] that's what brother R says you know it's
[5:06] figuratively right he's a heart of God
[5:08] he's the character of God Hebrews 1:3
[5:10] you know Jesus is the express image of
[5:12] God the exact reproduction of God Amen
[5:15] so we see God doesn't rebuke us because
[5:18] uh you know the wrong reasons God
[5:19] rebukes us to try to help us amen just
[5:22] like you would correct your child right
[5:24] parents and the parents said or your
[5:26] dogs you're trying to help your dogs
[5:29] right
[5:30] they got to learn right and so God you
[5:33] know Jesus wasn't being mean in that way
[5:34] to his own disciples but he was trying
[5:36] to encourage them get out of the Flesh
[5:38] and get into the Holy Spirit praise God
[5:40] Amen he chastens all those that he loves
[5:43] so if God has rebuked you lately that's
[5:45] a good sign he loves you am hallelujah
[5:48] it's not easy to receive that at times
[5:51] but it's true if God rebukes you then he
[5:54] loves you hallelujah amen and he wants
[5:57] his aim is correction yeah amen
[6:00] hallelujah I like what brother tells us
[6:01] though he gives us wisdom for humans you
[6:03] know the wisdom for humans brother said
[6:05] in the church age book he said he says
[6:07] start with a positive before you bring
[6:09] the
[6:10] correction right so so you know all of
[6:13] us have bosses right or one time had a
[6:15] boss or and uh you know it feels really
[6:18] bad when the boss doesn't recognize all
[6:20] the good things you did they just come
[6:22] up and say you did this wrong I remember
[6:23] Austin was tell me about that at Mustard
[6:25] Seed one time you know he just felt bad
[6:27] you know getting all these rebukes and
[6:29] not any
[6:30] compliments right we can do all this
[6:32] extra work and it's nobody sees it
[6:34] except
[6:35] God Amen God sees it Hallelujah but then
[6:39] it can be discouraging so brother tells
[6:40] us as parents and as as Saints right if
[6:44] we're going to correct people if we're
[6:45] going to correct others we should start
[6:46] with a positive and then bring the
[6:48] correction now none of us are perfect
[6:50] right but it's a really good thing and
[6:52] I've learned that at school I've used
[6:53] that a lot at school you know and also
[6:55] you know through comments and so forth
[6:57] like that I'll say well God bless you
[6:58] and appreciate you thanks for the
[6:59] comment here's here's some correction
[7:02] you know uh and so Jesus went from anger
[7:05] to weeping and then the Bible said he
[7:07] thank God that God had hid these things
[7:10] from the wise and prudent and had
[7:12] revealed them unto babes such as would
[7:14] learn so we see he had the emotion of
[7:16] Thanksgiving thank you God Amen thank
[7:18] God that there's a little elect church
[7:20] that believes the word of
[7:22] God I'm talking about you hallelujah
[7:24] amen so Jesus would thank God for you if
[7:27] he was here praise God In the Flesh I'm
[7:29] talking
[7:30] he would do that he would be he'd be
[7:32] thanking God thank God there's a church
[7:33] in Aur thank God there's a church in
[7:35] Napoleon and albian Hallelujah and Iowa
[7:38] City hallelujah thank God that there's
[7:40] Saints all around there in Sheffield and
[7:42] Lorraine thank God there's Saints out
[7:44] there who who who have come to God like
[7:46] a child they come with childlike faith
[7:48] and they receive the simple revelation
[7:50] of the Bible amen like I showed you a
[7:52] couple weeks ago you know I'm making a
[7:53] video on it now there's over a 100
[7:56] differences I'm up to 110 now 110
[7:58] differences between between all the
[8:00] churches and the
[8:01] bride just based upon Doctrine remember
[8:04] one Doctrine off is Gang Green it's a
[8:06] flesh eating disease or it's a Le that's
[8:09] only going to spread to the rest of the
[8:11] the love so think about that what kind
[8:13] of spiritual condition do most these
[8:15] churches have if they have
[8:18] 114 what what do you want to say
[8:21] measures of of
[8:23] canker can I say like this a cancer I'll
[8:26] just say like that they have a four 114
[8:28] different kinds of of cancer mhm what
[8:31] kind of church are they going to have
[8:32] they going to have a spiritual church no
[8:35] that's why they allow ballpark
[8:36] prophecies that's why they allow
[8:38] fornication and adultery and
[8:39] homosexuality has everybody see that by
[8:41] God's grace but by God's grace we can be
[8:45] free from that praise God Amen the Bible
[8:47] said we the holy ghost can guide us into
[8:49] all truth not just some but all truth
[8:51] praise God Amen Hallelujah and so that's
[8:54] what Jesus was thanking God for thank
[8:56] God that uh he can reveal his truth
[9:00] to a group of people that can have
[9:02] childlike faith in other words just
[9:03] believe the word of God just believe
[9:06] what the Bible says hallelujah just know
[9:08] that God doesn't add or take away you
[9:10] know no should ever add or take away
[9:12] from God's word hallelujah just believe
[9:15] what the Bible says amen amen then we
[9:18] finish the last time with
[9:20] rejoicing how Jesus rejoiced yeah he was
[9:23] thankful yeah Rejoice that was in the
[9:24] same context he rejoiced in spirit so he
[9:27] went from an angry Spirit imagine Jesus
[9:29] being angry with the cords and the whips
[9:32] and then not long later he'd be
[9:33] rejoicing amen
[9:35] hallelujah and see notice he rejoices
[9:38] over the Believers amen I preached that
[9:41] verse on Sunday the Bible said uh from
[9:43] Isaiah that God rejoices over Israel as
[9:47] a husband rejoices over his bride
[9:49] hallelujah amen hallelujah and that's
[9:52] what God thinks about you God rejoices
[9:54] over you hallelujah amen God Delights in
[9:57] your worship God Delights in your songs
[9:59] God Delights in your prayers Hallelujah
[10:01] God Delights in fellowship with you
[10:03] Hallelujah CU you're the bride you keep
[10:05] all the word you're submission to all
[10:07] the word of God hallelujah amen that's
[10:09] my challenge that's my humble simple
[10:11] challenge show me where I'm off the word
[10:13] hallelujah and it just it by God's grace
[10:16] we're not perfect but our major
[10:18] doctrines are right Hallelujah so are
[10:20] our minors amen I'll say like that by
[10:22] God's grace now we didn't get to this
[10:25] one but it's very simple Hebrews 4:15
[10:28] for we have nothing not in other words
[10:29] we have a high priest which can be
[10:32] touched with the feeling of infirmities
[10:34] so it's in the negative which we have
[10:36] not a high priest which cannot be
[10:37] touched but we know what it's saying we
[10:39] have a high priest that can be touched
[10:41] with the feeling of our infirmity so
[10:43] Jesus knows what you're going
[10:46] through right whether it's depression or
[10:49] overwhelm right nervousness but R said
[10:52] nervousness is hereditary how many know
[10:55] that many times people are nervous
[10:57] because their parents were nervous
[10:59] nervous right I just heard brother say
[11:01] that today he said people will cross
[11:04] Bridges before they get to them they're
[11:05] already nervous about something that
[11:07] hasn't even happened yet now we're all
[11:08] guilty right we all need to cast our
[11:11] cares on the Lord but many times that's
[11:13] hered hereditary so you can expect to
[11:16] get Deliverance but then expect it's
[11:17] going to come back right especially if
[11:19] you spend time around your family
[11:21] Hallelujah because your family I'm
[11:23] talking natural family doesn't always
[11:25] bring out the best in
[11:27] you Hallelujah I can say Amen to that
[11:30] Hallelujah not always I got some good
[11:32] family too by God's grace I'm talking
[11:34] about some of them don't like I'll just
[11:36] be you know just be PL you some
[11:37] sometimes sometimes my dad is kind of
[11:38] negative that kind of that that can rub
[11:40] off on me if I'm not careful right or
[11:43] sometimes my mom can be a little loose
[11:45] that can rub off on me if I'm not
[11:46] careful that's what I'm saying right
[11:49] because I can see I I can almost feel
[11:51] and know what they're going to say
[11:53] before they say it m yeah and then I
[11:56] find myself saying things my dad said
[11:57] you know like laugh at pain you know are
[12:00] these things that my dad said go to
[12:02] college son you know those things like
[12:03] that don't work in a factory your whole
[12:05] life that's what he told me but see you
[12:07] know we got to be mindful though we got
[12:09] to be like a city that's got
[12:11] walls we got to put protections up to
[12:14] protect our thinking our human spirit
[12:17] amen yes amen but Jesus Can Be Touched
[12:22] by the feeling and our of our
[12:23] infirmities that means he can be
[12:25] affected with the same
[12:27] feeling that means he can feel what
[12:29] you're feeling amen that's what the
[12:31] Bible
[12:33] says isn't that amazing Church he's in a
[12:35] glorified body that can never sin again
[12:39] I'm sorry that can never sin at all
[12:40] sorry Jesus never sinned he's in a body
[12:43] I meant that can never die again right
[12:46] his body never Sinn he's in a glorified
[12:48] body he's got white robe on but yet he
[12:50] can feel the struggles you're feeling
[12:53] now that's to me that's a wonderful high
[12:55] priest hallelujah amen you got somebody
[12:57] on your side who knows what what you've
[12:59] gone through praise godh amen isn't that
[13:01] wonderful amen Jesus knows he can feel
[13:04] what you're going through and now only
[13:07] that uh he can be a high priest for you
[13:10] he can intercede to the father for you
[13:12] amen Lord help you know he says father
[13:15] help brother Jesse because he's battling
[13:17] depression or he's battling uh passions
[13:19] or whatever he's battling right he can
[13:22] feel that and he can pray the Bible said
[13:25] he prayed with strong crying and strong
[13:28] Tears while was on Earth so we know
[13:31] Jesus prays with sincerity hallelujah
[13:33] amen amen we know that the scripture is
[13:35] telling us the truth Jesus can feel what
[13:37] we feel
[13:40] Hallelujah yet without sin Hallelujah he
[13:43] was tempted at all points like as we
[13:46] are yet without sin so that means he can
[13:49] feel for you church he can have
[13:51] compassion upon you amen he can
[13:54] sympathize with you amen hallelujah
[13:58] right we always we sometimes don't get
[13:59] sympathy from others tough it up be a
[14:03] man be a
[14:06] woman or no there's no compassion nobody
[14:09] stops and says uh why you down today
[14:11] brother great sister why no maybe nobody
[14:14] pays attention to you right and the
[14:17] devil just likes to kick us while we're
[14:20] down but Jesus can have compassion amen
[14:24] and he does have compassion and He does
[14:27] care praise God Amen who's the one that
[14:29] comes to you when no one else feels like
[14:31] is around that's Jesus Hallelujah right
[14:33] amen who's the one telling you to
[14:34] worship and sing and put on that good
[14:36] old Snappy gospel music amen amen it's
[14:38] start praising God that's the Holy
[14:40] Spirit hallelujah
[14:42] amen or maybe somebody does text you out
[14:44] of the blue or something like that
[14:46] that's Jesus that's his love letting you
[14:49] know that he has compassion upon you
[14:51] praise God I haven't got to my text yet
[14:53] so I just kind of preaching there
[14:55] Proverbs 25:28 he that hath no rule now
[14:58] the the word
[15:01] rule here the word rule means to
[15:04] control there it is restraint sorry I
[15:07] lost my side there he that hath no
[15:10] constra I'm sorry restraint over his own
[15:12] spirit is like a city that's broken
[15:16] down Hallelujah and Without Walls
[15:21] Hallelujah you know if you read the old
[15:23] Old Testament that's what happened all
[15:25] the time right in the old days a city an
[15:27] entire city would get
[15:29] plummeted right how many times have they
[15:31] I think I was looking at it what time
[15:32] was there 11 times Jerusalem's been
[15:34] burnt to the
[15:35] groundh I mean and the enemy is just
[15:38] coming after God's holy city but God's
[15:41] going to get the final say hallelujah
[15:43] God always gets the last word amen
[15:45] hallelujah praise God burn it down do
[15:47] whatever you want but I will restore
[15:49] sayith the Lord hallelujah amen he that
[15:53] ha no restraint over his own
[15:56] mind is like a City that's broken down
[16:02] Hallelujah so see friends uh we can look
[16:05] at this here your spirit has five Realms
[16:08] conscious memory reason affection
[16:10] imagination and I believe affection is
[16:12] the realm of
[16:14] emotion so if we don't control these
[16:16] five areas the enemy can make us upset
[16:19] if somebody doesn't shake our Shake our
[16:21] hand after church right just something
[16:23] that small right that can upset us like
[16:27] oh they must not love
[16:30] me you know if you don't have the walls
[16:33] buil up anything can offend
[16:35] you right but the Bible said to be slow
[16:39] to wrath and the church
[16:41] said not quick like oh my whole day is
[16:45] ruined because of that or my husband or
[16:47] my wife or my mom or my dad or my
[16:50] sibling one little one little arrow
[16:53] shouldn't uh defeat your whole city and
[16:55] the church
[16:56] said right but it does if our walls are
[16:59] broken down and what's our wall what's
[17:01] our protection the word of God
[17:03] hallelujah very simply the word of God
[17:06] is our protection
[17:08] MH right and really nobody can hurt us
[17:11] if we got the walls of protection up
[17:14] amen amen hallelujah and then if we got
[17:17] the walls of protection of we will love
[17:19] the unlovable will love our enemies will
[17:22] bless those who persecute us amen
[17:26] hallelujah amen amen that's what you
[17:29] know got that's that proves Jesus had
[17:31] his walls up Stephen has his had his
[17:34] walls up when he said Lord don't lay it
[17:35] to their charge amen amen Jesus had his
[17:38] walls up
[17:40] right he sure did he kept the walls up
[17:44] how do you keep them up through that
[17:45] faithful prayer there in the garden ofy
[17:48] amen Lord let your will be done not my
[17:51] will be done hallelujah that faithful
[17:54] prayer kept his walls
[17:56] up do you think he wanted to slap them
[17:59] back I I I would imagine his flesh
[18:00] wanted
[18:01] to CU remember he was sweating drops of
[18:05] blood not wanting to go to the
[18:08] Cross
[18:12] right now so we must have control over
[18:17] our spirit we must restrain our
[18:21] mind so by the Holy Spirit we control
[18:24] feelings remember now they boil it down
[18:26] to four I don't know if that's wrong or
[18:27] not but I just like that
[18:28] right or not but happiness sadness anger
[18:31] fear we must control happiness not get
[18:33] happy for worldly things only get happy
[18:35] for God right we must not get sad in a
[18:38] sinful way but yes we can mourn when
[18:40] things are really sad in a in a holy way
[18:43] we must not get angry in a sinful way
[18:45] but it's okay to be angry in a holy
[18:47] way and we uh must have reverential fear
[18:51] for God and not fear of man Hallelujah
[18:55] that's the great spirit on the Amish
[18:57] community fear of man right that's what
[19:00] they said thank God for victory
[19:02] hallelujah amen thank God for victory
[19:04] through the blood amen second Timothy
[19:06] 2:24 H it says and the servant of the
[19:08] Lord must not
[19:10] strive Hallelujah but be gentle unto all
[19:13] men apt to teach and patient but yet
[19:17] Paul the same one that wrote this called
[19:19] the Galatians foolish Galatians who ha
[19:21] Bewitched you so see friends there's a
[19:23] balance just like Jesus sometimes notice
[19:26] he was very gentle with the children did
[19:28] you notice that about Jesus who was some
[19:30] of those Pharisees he wasn't so
[19:33] gentle right and Paul would not give a
[19:36] Paul would not give a requirement that
[19:38] Jesus didn't
[19:39] fulfill so Jesus was gentle when it was
[19:41] time to be
[19:43] gentle he was angry when it was time to
[19:45] be angry so you understand God Paul's
[19:48] not saying we must be perfect or or
[19:50] never get angry that's not what he's
[19:51] saying cuz Jesus got angry but these are
[19:54] General
[19:56] requirements he must be gentle unto to
[19:58] all men at to teach
[20:02] patient in meekness instructing those
[20:04] that oppose themselves see many times
[20:08] you know people come to me whether an
[20:09] email or Voice or whatever and they're
[20:12] they're actually caught in their own sin
[20:14] they're they're opposing themselves
[20:16] they're fighting against themselves like
[20:18] the one case all the brother had to do
[20:20] was just uh get a different phone right
[20:23] just get a get a dumb phone a flip phone
[20:26] that that will solve many of your like
[20:28] brother Dennis said just don't go out to
[20:30] the battle right don't put yourself in
[20:33] that
[20:34] situation right they they're opposing
[20:37] themselves or marriage trouble and they
[20:39] won't even say they're sorry to their
[20:41] spouse well you're just fighting
[20:42] yourself
[20:44] then because you've probably done twice
[20:46] as much to your spouse you know yet they
[20:48] won't even repent say they're sorry if
[20:51] God per Adventure will give them
[20:52] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[20:54] truth so see when people oppose
[20:56] themselves they can't humble themselves
[20:58] and accept the
[21:00] truth can I say like this it's like a
[21:03] secret
[21:04] sin like we heard on Sunday right that's
[21:06] what I want to preach I want to preach a
[21:07] sermon just a sermon on secret sins All
[21:09] Through the Bible I might do that on
[21:11] Sunday Lord really I kind of had that
[21:12] thought come to me so we'll see how the
[21:13] St goes on Saturday or Sunday
[21:17] morning but see they they they won't
[21:19] acknowledge the truth like I was wrong
[21:23] it's my fault I've got some wrongs on my
[21:26] side too I need to say sorry for yeah
[21:29] right right that they may recover
[21:31] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[21:32] so the Satan Satan has caught them in a
[21:35] trap by their own lust right or own
[21:38] Pride lust of the eyes lust of the flesh
[21:40] pride of life who are taken captive by
[21:43] him at his will remember Jesus told
[21:47] Peter Satan has tried to sift you like
[21:49] wheat it was Satan's will to to take
[21:53] Peter away from the faith but Jesus said
[21:55] I pray for you that your faith doesn't
[21:57] fail hallah
[21:58] amen if you if you feel like you're
[22:00] going to fall call somebody amen yes ask
[22:03] ask for intercessory prayer hallelujah
[22:05] amen amen because if God honored jesus'
[22:08] prayer to hold Peter if God honored
[22:10] Abraham's prayer to hold lot God will
[22:13] hear your prayer
[22:14] Hallelujah think of all the faithful
[22:16] prayers you prayed for your loved ones
[22:18] that maybe aren't serving God or maybe
[22:20] are caught in the snare of the devil
[22:22] let's have confidence in God that God
[22:24] hears our prayers amen that's one of the
[22:26] brothers was he was so blessed when I
[22:28] preached that he said I didn't I I
[22:29] forgot the Bible I didn't know the Bible
[22:31] said God remembered Abraham to save lot
[22:34] amen God Will Remember You amen amen God
[22:37] to remember your prayers for your loved
[22:39] ones that need salvation praise God am
[22:41] amise God remember Abraham interceded 50
[22:45] 40 35 30 20 if there be 10 save their
[22:49] souls Lord whatever you do have mercy
[22:52] and save Souls God hears and remembers
[22:55] that kind of prayer amen amen
[22:58] all right so see a servant of the Lord
[23:01] must have his walls up because he's
[23:04] gentle not attacks he doesn't attack
[23:07] others by violence and
[23:09] aggression I'm talking about sinful
[23:11] violence and aggression didn't Jesus
[23:13] look low pretty pretty aggressive when
[23:15] he got the Rope out didn't he look
[23:16] pretty aggressive Saints the Bible said
[23:18] he drove them out he didn't say excuse
[23:21] me would you like to leave he drove them
[23:24] out brother R said if Jesus was here in
[23:26] a lot of churches he'd be thrown tables
[23:28] over today amen now which preacher is
[23:31] going to be the first one to do
[23:32] that not
[23:35] me Hallelujah because we want to have
[23:37] grace and patience he's the son of God
[23:40] but the the the truth is here that uh we
[23:43] can see that sometimes there there you
[23:45] know we we we go back and forth between
[23:48] emotions I've seen all the time in the
[23:50] service I'll be really rebuking
[23:51] something then I'll be crying and
[23:53] dancing and joyful at the end how did I
[23:55] go from all those emotions God likes to
[23:57] use our emotions
[23:59] God wants you to experience all these
[24:00] emotions just like Jesus amen hallelujah
[24:04] said remember brother said he would use
[24:06] a little humor to open up people's
[24:08] Spirits so they
[24:10] relax and he could actually minister to
[24:12] them with a little humor that's why I
[24:14] don't mind just cracking a little joke
[24:17] or just trying to get people to laugh a
[24:18] little bit calm down a little bit right
[24:21] just relax God's here God he's Among Us
[24:24] he said wherever two or three are there
[24:26] I am in the mid yeah he's here kind of
[24:29] helps me relax
[24:31] too so it's so the the preacher's got to
[24:34] have his walls up and so does every
[24:36] Christian remember friends in the
[24:38] natural walls always had
[24:41] watchtowers and Ezekiel said oh Washman
[24:43] what of the night every city had to have
[24:45] a watch for
[24:47] danger Hallelujah and brother said
[24:50] that's why God gives you the Holy Ghost
[24:52] he says like a buzzer to protect your
[24:54] life amen Glory Hallelujah
[24:59] and so if we when we have our walls up
[25:01] when our walls are really up we can hear
[25:03] the warning of the Holy Spirit don't say
[25:05] that don't do that don't go there don't
[25:08] click on that don't watch that that's
[25:11] right don't reply to that
[25:13] yet right right
[25:17] Hallelujah but if our walls are broken
[25:19] down then we'll just do whatever we want
[25:21] then well whatever I feel like I want to
[25:23] do it's my life well it is your life but
[25:27] really it's
[25:28] life amen
[25:31] hallelujah so we must so we must watch
[25:33] then for Dangerous attacks on our
[25:36] emotions they don't look for Chariots of
[25:38] Steel and wood they to watch out for uh
[25:41] battering rams and ladders and arrows
[25:43] and all the swords then to watch out for
[25:46] that we got to watch out for lies of the
[25:48] enemy doubt and fear and
[25:51] discouragement right and pride of life
[25:54] and all these things we have to watch
[25:55] out for those and I'll say this they're
[25:57] just as dangerous as the other ones if
[25:59] not more right amen but say we're living
[26:02] in a more deceptive day today because
[26:04] before you could be killed for a
[26:06] Christian but now Satan comes saying
[26:08] he's a
[26:09] Christian in the in the false preachers
[26:12] amen they're going to be saying peace
[26:14] and safety through God the the pope will
[26:18] sit in the temple of God saying that he
[26:20] is God now thank God we'll be enjoying a
[26:22] three and a half year man supper the
[26:23] lamb during that timej thank God we W
[26:25] have to worry about that but it's slow
[26:27] holy building it's building towards uh
[26:30] the Roman Catholic church and the
[26:31] uniting of church and state again with
[26:34] Rome right it's building like that
[26:38] Hallelujah so what is our protection our
[26:40] protection is the word of God Amen the
[26:43] only wall that you and I have is the
[26:46] word of God to protect us from showing
[26:49] the wrong
[26:55] emotions now there's a quote you
[26:57] remember brother said this in the in the
[26:58] Seven Seals I was just reminded this
[27:00] while I was studying brother raham said
[27:02] if if your soul is sealed by the Holy
[27:04] Ghost Satan cannot get to you because
[27:07] you're sealed by the Holy
[27:09] Ghost but really it's any believer Satan
[27:12] can't make us do
[27:14] anything right says we what we have to
[27:16] do if we sin we have to leave the
[27:19] protection of the word of God Satan
[27:21] can't come into us but what we do is we
[27:23] get tempted and we go out to him and we
[27:26] yield to him
[27:28] just like brother said about Eve brother
[27:30] said God gave Eve the greatest
[27:32] protection the word but she went out
[27:34] from behind the word of God and that's
[27:37] when she got attacked she had no walls
[27:38] of
[27:39] protection as long as she she would have
[27:41] said God said thou shout not eat as long
[27:44] as she said that God said don't eat as
[27:46] long as she said that she was she was
[27:48] safe but as soon as she started
[27:50] questioning that she got out and the
[27:52] walls came
[27:54] down right and now look what look what
[27:56] we have here look look at the world
[28:00] today and this was I think I'll just lay
[28:02] this in here this was the question
[28:04] brother Urban had why did lot even uh
[28:09] offer his daughter to these Wicked
[28:12] sodomites and you know I had that
[28:14] question before and I don't remember how
[28:16] I answered it but I was kind of like
[28:17] Lord you know I just kept talking all of
[28:19] a sudden the Bible the the Holy Spirit I
[28:22] felt reminded me of the scripture he was
[28:23] a vexed man that means tormented he and
[28:28] the Bible said not just once in a while
[28:30] every day he was
[28:31] tormented and brother called him a penny
[28:34] while Abraham was a silver dollar right
[28:37] amen so God could do a hundred times
[28:39] more with Abraham than he could with
[28:41] lot and so the reason he offers his
[28:44] daughters because he was not a very good
[28:46] man at that point he was just barely
[28:49] saved the Bible said the righteous that
[28:51] were scarcely saved yeah he was just
[28:54] barely saved what kind of dad would do
[28:57] that a an awful day so show he was in a
[29:00] moment of fear he was already in a state
[29:02] of Torment his walls were down church
[29:06] amen and when your walls are down when
[29:07] your emotions are shot or when your mind
[29:09] is shot you might almost say anything
[29:11] you might do anything but said remember
[29:13] last week I was just ready to tell God I
[29:15] won't serve him then but then he said
[29:18] thank God the anchor held
[29:20] Hallelujah I was just about ready to say
[29:23] I won't preach then but thank God that
[29:26] anchor was there thank God the the Holy
[29:29] Ghost was there in my soul praise God
[29:31] Amen I was just about ready to do
[29:34] something but God stepped it and the
[29:35] church
[29:36] said well see that's why lot could do
[29:39] things like that because he didn't have
[29:40] that real Holy Ghost anchor that's right
[29:42] that's excellent question he gave
[29:44] us he was a saved
[29:48] man but yet he was a man full of
[29:51] vexation and
[29:53] torment think about that demon powers
[29:55] tormenting everything he saw was
[29:57] homosexuality and aggression and uh
[30:00] awful mobs and gangs doing awful
[30:04] things that's all he saw and he was just
[30:07] overwhelmed with this barely saved
[30:11] barely and remember his home life wasn't
[30:14] any good either so wonder what was
[30:16] inside of his home hey brother Dennis
[30:18] just preached out aan I wonder what was
[30:20] in lot's house the angels are like lot
[30:23] like come on in angels's like no I'll
[30:25] sleep on the street when was the last
[30:26] time you wanted to sleep sleep on the
[30:28] street so what kind of house did this
[30:30] guy have wonder what was hiding in there
[30:34] yeah but finally you know he persuades
[30:35] them they come in he said you better go
[30:37] get your your son son-in-laws and your
[30:39] daughters tell them the city's going to
[30:41] be
[30:42] destroyed I just thought that was really
[30:45] something so his home life wasn't very
[30:47] good he was uh tormented
[30:50] daily and brother said we want to live
[30:52] in a way where
[30:54] angels will want to come into our home
[30:59] Hallelujah didn't the angel visit uh
[31:01] Abraham praise God he ate some calf and
[31:04] he ate some butter and milk Hallelujah
[31:06] drank some milk he lived in such a way
[31:10] where the Angels could visit him church

[31:13] cars am we should expect angels for sure

[37:19] with the word obey the word amen say
[37:22] what the word says hallelujah amen so I
[37:25] find it like that in my life too i' got
[37:28] to repent and then get a scripture and
[37:30] build the wall build the wall build the
[37:34] I'm not getting about
[37:35] this not but that's that something
[37:40] that's like a that's a natural thing of
[37:41] what the spiritual that's what God is
[37:42] saying build the wall of our minds amen
[37:46] amen in other words build up so much
[37:48] peace in your heart that nothing can
[37:49] take away the peace away uhhuh amen
[37:52] hallelujah build up so much joy in your
[37:54] life that the devil can't take your joy
[37:57] M Church said amen Build It Up Build It
[38:01] Up strong you know he's you know the
[38:03] devil's going to come back at some point
[38:04] with one of his imps right some type of
[38:11] Temptation he's going to come back
[38:13] there's a time and season he's going to
[38:15] come back so we got to build the wall
[38:17] build strength build
[38:20] build through the word of God well I
[38:22] know the devil's going to come back uh
[38:24] now he's going to try to come back and
[38:26] and bring that certain person I know
[38:28] he's going to bring that certain song or
[38:29] that certain uh website or that certain
[38:32] restaurant I know it's going to come
[38:34] back to that certain person so let's
[38:35] build a wall let's get ready for it
[38:37] reminds me of Ahab remember the Bible
[38:39] God told Ahab I just flipped through
[38:40] that this week God told Ahab the enemy
[38:43] was coming and he said you better get
[38:45] ready and the first time he got ready I
[38:47] think the second time he didn't take
[38:49] heed to it what a perfect lesson I'll
[38:51] have to preach that maybe next Wednesday
[38:52] by God maybe Sunday we'll see but we
[38:55] know that enem is coming so let's get
[38:58] ready to defeat him praise God amen
[39:04] amen so I will not waste time on my
[39:07] phone I will not speak angrily to my mom
[39:10] or dad or siblings Etc I will not steal
[39:13] I will not lie I will not waste my time
[39:16] because I'm strong in the faith right
[39:18] now am I'm putting up walls to protect
[39:20] me pray always I'm always telling the
[39:23] truth I'm I'm not going to uh uh not I'm
[39:26] not going to uh exaggerate that's the
[39:28] word that's sometimes I'm guilty of
[39:29] exaggeration like brother my wife can
[39:31] say Amen to that U my family PR is all
[39:34] sayen that I just get going and I just I
[39:37] just exaggerate and I've got to say Lord
[39:40] I'm not help me I'm not going to
[39:41] exaggerate I'm tell exactly what the
[39:43] truth is
[39:45] amen so I see I'm like brother Rand in
[39:47] that manner brother said he battled with
[39:52] exaggeration Hallelujah now if you got
[39:55] your Bibles uh let's go to 1 Corinthians
[39:57] 3 6 1 Corinthians
[39:59] 3:6 I want to read a few things
[40:03] um with this
[40:06] emotion the emotion of adoration just
[40:09] Str
[40:15] me sometimes
[40:17] church we admire people in the message
[40:20] so much don't
[40:22] we I have I've admired preachers so much
[40:26] and then as I've shared with you now I
[40:28] see some things I don't admire so
[40:31] much but the emotion of
[40:34] adoration I'm sure you feel it here too
[40:36] I'm sure you appreciate people's
[40:38] testimonies you really admire them but
[40:40] we must always be careful not to make
[40:43] that adoration too high the Bible said
[40:46] give
[40:47] honor right but we can't give too much
[40:50] honor praise God there's a reason I'm
[40:53] sharing this so I want to read the
[40:55] scripture first I'm just to tell
[40:56] story I have planted Apollo's water but
[40:59] God gave the increase verse
[41:01] 7even so then neither is he that planted
[41:03] anything neither he that water but God
[41:06] that gave the increase amen okay so
[41:08] we're seeing preachers or teachers or
[41:11] whatever it is pastors prophets
[41:14] evangelists the Bible said they're all
[41:16] Planters and Waters but they can't make
[41:18] anything grow right they they have a
[41:20] certain job but they can't bring life
[41:23] only God can bring life amen so anybody
[41:26] ever gets life it's not the preacher's
[41:28] reward it's God's work amen the preacher
[41:31] just did the natural thing that had to
[41:33] be
[41:34] done right verse
[41:37] eight now he that planteth and he that
[41:39] WTH are one and every man shall receive
[41:42] his own reward according to his own
[41:44] labor okay so here we can see uh oh now
[41:47] go to Romans uh 123 Romans
[41:51] 12:3 and this is a real life example I'm
[41:53] going to share as well theemotion of
[41:56] adoration we got to control
[41:58] that for example here's another one too
[42:00] this is not the one I'm going to share
[42:02] but some people admired brother R so
[42:04] much that when they found out he was a
[42:07] human they left the
[42:09] message they call him all these
[42:12] names right so that was too much
[42:15] adoration a lot of it was
[42:18] ignorance now that proves the people
[42:20] really didn't listen to brother brand
[42:22] right right because if you listen to
[42:23] brother BR you know he's a human right
[42:26] because he says it all the
[42:28] time right but that's one example too
[42:30] much
[42:32] adoration right Paul saw he said I'm
[42:34] glad I baptized none of you in Corinth
[42:36] because you would have baptized you
[42:37] would have said I baptized in my name
[42:40] see it's just common Christians have to
[42:42] battle the emotion of too much adoration
[42:45] like I told you that example from
[42:46] Columbus that brother ComEd up we had
[42:48] three people healed that service two or
[42:49] three I'm okay don't exaggerate we had
[42:51] two or three people heing that I know
[42:53] the mom and the son were healed Daren
[42:56] and and beatric were healed in that
[42:58] service at least two and the brother
[43:01] come up and he said I think he told my
[43:04] wife what is it like living with this
[43:06] man
[43:07] Jesse that's a little too much
[43:09] adoration well a couple of years later
[43:11] now he's making fun of me because I got
[43:12] a big family so he surely lost that
[43:14] adoration in the process of a few years
[43:17] but I remember that I remember in the
[43:18] parking lot when he said that what is it
[43:20] like to live with this G talking about
[43:25] me
[43:27] but it it's now he was a young believer
[43:30] and he KN and he knew and by our
[43:32] conversation he did not have the Holy
[43:33] Ghost so something to keep in
[43:36] mind right this emotion when people
[43:38] overly adore people Church it leads to a
[43:41] lot of
[43:43] trouble anytime your emotions are not in
[43:46] check the walls are down and you're open
[43:48] to
[43:49] anything any
[43:51] attack to be ins snared to be taken by
[43:54] Satan at his own will because you and I
[43:57] might have given into
[44:00] it for I say through the grace given
[44:02] unto me to every man that is among you
[44:04] not to think of himself more highly than
[44:06] he ought to but to think soberly as God
[44:08] hath dealt to every man The Measure of
[44:10] Faith now this is course speaking of
[44:12] ourselves right but so we must not think
[44:15] highly of ourselves well like Paul said
[44:18] here we shouldn't think too highly of
[44:20] preachers
[44:21] either okay now the story I want to
[44:23] share is actually uh
[44:26] close to our church in one
[44:30] way but I was listening to a preacher
[44:32] preached and uh he was talking about
[44:37] emotions and uh and in this sermon
[44:40] numerous times I'm trying not to
[44:42] exaggerate so help me Lord numerous
[44:44] times he talked about his Pastor he was
[44:45] really admiring his Pastor just brought
[44:47] up his Pastor numerous times during the
[44:48] sermon how much he admired as
[44:52] pastor and then fast forward a couple
[44:54] years the pastor up and leaves the
[44:58] church and the pastor didn't show this
[45:01] brother any love well according to him
[45:04] that's what he told me because I talked
[45:05] to him personally about it I talked to
[45:06] him
[45:07] personally and I I know what I'm talking
[45:10] about this pastor didn't show this
[45:12] brother any
[45:14] love and it destroyed the preacher where
[45:18] he couldn't even preach or go to church
[45:20] for 5 to 10
[45:22] years and this a man who says he had the
[45:24] Holy Ghost
[45:26] my wife and I have seen God use his
[45:28] gifts to discern our family situation
[45:31] I'll just say it like
[45:32] that it's as if he preached this family
[45:35] member's entire life right right in our
[45:38] church but think about that do you hold
[45:41] anybody too high that if they fell or
[45:43] they left or they didn't say exactly
[45:45] everything perfect to you would you fall
[45:47] away out of
[45:51] church and go into plain depression he
[45:54] told me he said I could could and then
[45:56] when I went to church I couldn't say
[45:57] Amen to anything for 5 to 10
[46:00] years how much praise did the devil take
[46:04] from that man that should have went to
[46:06] God and we're supposed to be Kings and
[46:07] Priests unto God right this man lost is
[46:11] just tring me now this man lost his
[46:13] entire Priestly Ministry said he
[46:15] couldn't even pray right couldn't even
[46:17] study couldn't even read the word of God
[46:20] because of too much adoration for one
[46:24] man see why we don't put too much
[46:26] adoration on
[46:28] people please don't lift me too high if
[46:30] you've been around me you won't you been
[46:33] around me more than five minutes you
[46:36] w because I'm just a human just a man
[46:40] and just like that told that the guy
[46:41] from Columbus he found out later I'm
[46:43] just a man and they can mock me and make
[46:45] fun of me to my face you know mock our
[46:47] family oh God has a way to get back with
[46:50] those people yeah the Bible said let the
[46:53] Lord have Vengeance vengeance is mine
[46:56] say the Lord God has a way to strank his
[46:58] children if they're really God's
[46:59] children I didn't say nothing I almost
[47:01] did I almost texted but
[47:04] I'm say they want I'm proud of my family
[47:06] in a Godly
[47:08] wayen not you know over overly admiring
[47:10] them
[47:12] but so let this be a lesson a man who
[47:15] preach and God uses him we've seen
[47:18] it can so highly Place emotions on I
[47:22] admire this person that when they get
[47:24] mistreated by that person they lose all
[47:27] their praise think about that what a
[47:32] snare and the only way to be hon only
[47:34] that was be honest and recover
[47:36] themselves and be acknowledge the truth
[47:38] that they put too much confidence in a
[47:40] man right and the church said amen amen
[47:44] or a woman right you might put it in
[47:45] your mom or your dad right or I can put
[47:48] it in my brothers they're preachers if I
[47:51] put so much adoration on people and yet
[47:54] when they fail me or or they God allows
[47:56] a mistake to happen I Lose My Faith and
[47:59] I can't even pray think about that you
[48:01] what what would keep you what would have
[48:03] to happen in your life to keep you from
[48:05] coming to church for 5 to 10
[48:10] years I just thought it was really
[48:14] striking because I can see someone
[48:17] admire admire boast I love this I love
[48:20] this man and then when that person
[48:22] mistreats it you lose all your walls go
[48:26] falling down and then every attack comes
[48:28] in there every attack oh he never loved
[48:31] me there's no much love in the church
[48:33] these people have the Holy Ghost look at
[48:34] all these arrows he's taken I can't even
[48:38] praise God I can't even worship God I
[48:41] can't even preach
[48:43] anymore so let's be careful how we
[48:45] handle the emotion of adoration the
[48:47] church said amen
[48:50] amen again like I said many people have
[48:53] uh now turned on brother Rand because
[48:56] they had too much
[48:58] adoration it was just a a human
[49:04] adoration so Church what does the Bible
[49:06] say make Christ your example right the
[49:08] Bible doesn't say looking unto a brother
[49:10] brandom for your faith the Bible say
[49:11] looking unto Jesus for your faith or
[49:14] place anybody in there you want Pastor
[49:16] so and so evangelist so and
[49:22] so and then when I found out you know
[49:24] the pastor that left left that hurt this
[49:26] other brother that Pastor then lifted up
[49:28] another brother too high and then that
[49:30] brother let him down and he uh and he
[49:33] even uh he went to a mental mental
[49:35] depression uh mental breakdown that's
[49:38] what it's
[49:38] called and then wondered am I even
[49:41] called to
[49:42] preach to see church we got to be very
[49:45] careful how we lift up other people
[49:47] right how we admire them let's make
[49:49] Christ our example like I told this
[49:51] brother Denis he said it really helped
[49:52] him I I SED that verse after Jesus all
[49:55] those Miracles I think it was in Mark
[49:56] chapter 3 the next morning he didn't get
[49:58] up I'm sorry next morning he didn't
[50:00] sleep in he actually got up early to go
[50:02] pray and I believe it was to keep
[50:03] himself
[50:05] humble right he didn't say let's have a
[50:07] party let's celebrate they could have in
[50:10] those days they could have he said I
[50:12] need to go spend time with the heavenly
[50:14] father right and make sure my heart's in
[50:16] the right
[50:17] place
[50:19] amen and I told you Church my heartest
[50:21] battle last week right I didn't tell you
[50:24] this I'm actually told before but that
[50:26] older gentleman the man who left the
[50:27] message I was almost at the spot of
[50:30] asking him to be my
[50:32] mentor because I I watched him handle a
[50:34] situation I think I told you this a
[50:36] young sister in the church came up and
[50:37] and tried to take the microphone from
[50:38] him right in the middle of our altar
[50:41] call you remember that that's a long
[50:43] time that's
[50:46] 2017 remember that one and then I I I
[50:50] then I was back there in the office when
[50:52] uh he called her in and just gently
[50:54] spoke with her didn't rebuke her just
[50:56] say you know this was wrong and she
[50:57] starts crying and and he brought all
[50:59] this sweetness to the situation I'm like
[51:01] man this guy's really a
[51:02] pastor and I've seen the Miracles you
[51:04] know they had different Miracles um his
[51:06] mom was
[51:07] dying and he's in the he's in the
[51:09] hospital oh the mom had died she
[51:13] flatlined and he said Lord Jesus he said
[51:16] you can have my mama but not now he said
[51:19] Lord Jesus I call for a spear to come
[51:21] back right now in Jesus Christ's name
[51:23] and she'd come back instantly and Liv
[51:25] four more years now that's real Faith
[51:27] right
[51:28] there when was the last time any of you
[51:30] called for a spirit to come back after
[51:32] it already
[51:34] left you see I was about I was about
[51:37] ready I just wow I saw these gifts I saw
[51:39] this faithfulness I saw what it really
[51:41] handles good situations I was about to
[51:43] ask that person to be my mentor and then
[51:45] this thing happens with they leave the
[51:47] message speak all these evil things so
[51:51] what was it for me it was a learning
[51:52] experience for me don't lift people too
[51:54] high right right the greatest Mentor I
[51:57] can have is
[51:58] Jesus although sometimes without having
[52:01] a dad you know in my teenager years I
[52:03] wish I had a mentor right like there's
[52:04] something long in me sister knows what
[52:06] I'm talking about you know I just wish I
[52:07] had a dad there for I just never had him
[52:09] so I wish I wish I had somebody to talk
[52:11] to like a buddy to go to another man but
[52:15] God had to show me don't lift anybody up
[52:17] too high yeah
[52:19] am Let Jesus be my counselor praise God
[52:22] amen
[52:24] amen
[52:26] so we have to be careful we don't put
[52:28] too much emphasis on other
[52:30] people too much adoration I'm already at
[52:32] 8:00 I didn't
[52:34] this uh Mark 81 let's go here I'll try
[52:37] to go a little bit further
[52:42] here and of course I'm I'm I'm always
[52:45] advocating show honor the Bible said
[52:46] give double honor to those who labor in
[52:48] the
[52:49] doctrine so people really labor to
[52:51] preach the truth you should give them
[52:52] double honor but not I'll said well I
[52:55] guess not triple honor I just say like
[52:57] that got to say that don't get qu triple
[53:01] honor don't make it over an abundance
[53:04] admiration and honor because you're
[53:06] going to get disappointed right then the
[53:09] devil can break down your walls and
[53:11] shoot every arrow in there every
[53:15] lie and you'll believe it you'll
[53:18] struggle with
[53:19] it but we want to be faithful praise God
[53:22] Mark
[53:24] 81
[53:34] in those days the multitude being very
[53:36] great and having nothing to eat Jesus
[53:38] called his disciples unto them and saith
[53:41] unto them I have compassion on the
[53:43] multitude because they have now been
[53:45] with me three days and have nothing to
[53:48] eat and if I send them away fasting to
[53:51] their own houses they will faint by the
[53:53] way for divers of them came from afar
[53:57] Hallelujah so here's another emotion
[53:59] Jesus SP
[54:03] compassion sometimes we don't see that
[54:04] in the message very much A lot of people
[54:07] aren't concerned about the poor they're
[54:09] not concerned about the weak right but
[54:12] Jesus clearly could feel compassion for
[54:15] people amen that's what we need
[54:18] Hallelujah we need to feel the
[54:20] compassion of the holy spirit amen for
[54:23] people that don't have food or people
[54:25] that are hungrier or in this case I mean
[54:27] they were people that probably had a
[54:28] living right but they were just in a
[54:30] spot where they're in an inconvenience
[54:32] they they're just not really close to
[54:33] food right they probably could pay they
[54:35] probably farms and Agricultural Society
[54:37] they probably had good families but
[54:39] they're just in a spot we a little down
[54:40] and out at that moment and Jesus has
[54:43] compassion on people who are down and
[54:45] out so let's ask the holy spirit is
[54:47] anybody down and out in our lives that
[54:49] we need to show compassion on it's a
[54:52] good question to ask our emotions
[54:56] should be just like
[54:59] Christ now does
[55:01] anybody know that at some point
[55:06] Jesus um told them they only came for
[55:09] him for bread does anybody remember that
[55:11] verse so there came a limit to The
[55:13] Compassion is what I'm trying to
[55:24] say see if I can find it real quick bear
[55:26] with me
[55:27] here anybody finds it let me know I'm
[55:29] looking up
[55:48] bread I'd like to be able to read it
[55:50] where uh it don't chop it
[55:54] up
[56:03] okay I have to look for it later here
[56:04] but uh I think you understand the
[56:07] story I Think Jesus fed the 5,000 a
[56:10] second time or 4,000 or 5,000 have to
[56:13] kind of Polish up on that story but he
[56:16] actually confronts the multitude how
[56:17] many remember that story and he says
[56:19] you're really only coming to me for
[56:21] natural bread so that gives a good
[56:23] balance Church we should feel compassion
[56:26] but after a while it's time to start
[56:28] calling up some
[56:30] accountability right I think I shared
[56:31] that with who did I share with brother
[56:32] Brooks yeah I sure with brother Brooks
[56:34] on the phone we were talking there right
[56:35] before uh
[56:36] Christmas Jesus said if a tree hasn't
[56:40] brought forth in three years he said one
[56:42] more time dung it up right give it one
[56:45] more year and then after that if it
[56:47] doesn't bring forth then get rid of it
[56:50] so brother's like yeah that's right at
[56:52] some point The Compassion has to run out
[56:55] okay so just so you know we're supposed
[56:57] to be used but not used too much and the
[57:01] church say amen amen hallelujah so Bible
[57:04] said uh love your enemies pray for those
[57:07] who despitefully use you but even Jesus
[57:09] at some point calls out their hypocrisy
[57:11] you're only coming here for natural
[57:12] things you're not coming here for
[57:13] Spiritual things I know if I did a
[57:15] Google search I could just type in Jesus
[57:18] uh rebuke some multitude for wanting
[57:19] bread I know it would come up and I
[57:20] could read it there
[57:23] but
[57:25] all
[57:27] right one more let's we'll do one more
[57:30] got it who found
[57:31] that lyia bless your heart giv you
[57:36] two quiet class John 626 Jesus answered
[57:40] them and said very I say to you you seek
[57:42] me not because you saw the Miracles but
[57:44] because you did eat of the Loaves and
[57:46] were filled
[57:48] he they wanted to they wanted to have
[57:51] food that's why they were coming to not
[57:52] for Supernatural not for the the word of
[57:55] God they're coming to him for food I've
[57:58] seen like this people that come like
[58:00] that eventually they'll leave the people
[58:02] that love God they stay for the word of
[58:04] God hallelujah might have to feed them
[58:05] for a little bit or something like that
[58:06] but they're going to catch the word of
[58:07] God they're going to love God's word
[58:09] with all their heart praise God Amen but
[58:11] the Bible says if you don't give food to
[58:13] the hungry if you don't give a Coke to a
[58:14] cold person your faith is dead but
[58:16] Church let's have Living Faith let's
[58:18] have the compassion of Christ hallelujah
[58:20] amen amen
[58:23] amen last one I think I'll stop right
[58:25] here by God's I didn't get to where I
[58:26] want to go so I think we're have a part
[58:28] three Lord willing next week by God's
[58:30] grace Luke 13 Luke
[58:35] 13:31 actually I'll do two more verses
[58:42] here the same day there came certain of
[58:44] the Pharisees saying to him get thee out
[58:46] and depart hence for her will kill you
[58:49] now look he's threatened with death he's
[58:52] got a death threat
[58:55] verse 32 and he said to them go ye and
[58:57] tell that fox and what's a fox Sly
[59:01] crafty
[59:02] animal brother said this is Jesus with
[59:05] the sense of
[59:07] humor so look at that the prince of God
[59:10] was on Jesus how do you know the
[59:11] fullness of God was in him amen when he
[59:14] received a death threat he responded
[59:16] with some
[59:18] humor other words I know where I stand
[59:20] Herod can't take my life he knew who was
[59:22] taking his life actually he dismissed
[59:25] his own Spirit the Bible say one one in
[59:27] one case said he died of a broken heart
[59:29] but the Bible
[59:30] said I dismissed my
[59:34] spirit so maybe that's they
[59:36] connected he said go tell that fox that
[59:39] slide crafty ruler behold I cast out
[59:41] Devils amen you can't stop the power of
[59:43] God and I do curse uh today no I do I
[59:47] got the wrong oh I do
[59:50] cures oh yeah I'm sorry I read that
[59:52] wrong the fox's too small
[59:55] and I do cures today and tomorrow and
[59:58] the third day I shall be perfected but
[1:00:00] God does allow
[1:00:01] curses that was I said that nevertheless
[1:00:04] I must walk today and tomorrow and the
[1:00:05] day following for it cannot be that a
[1:00:07] prophet perish out of jerus Jerusalem so
[1:00:10] he gets a death threat what's his next
[1:00:12] emotion
[1:00:13] humor sometimes church we do have to
[1:00:15] laugh off things I just gave you a Bible
[1:00:18] example right
[1:00:19] there sometimes you got to laugh threats
[1:00:21] off oh nothing's going to happen to me
[1:00:23] God's taking care of me nothing's going
[1:00:26] to happen to me my walls are built up
[1:00:28] and strong praise God God has me
[1:00:31] fortified by the Holy Spirit like like
[1:00:34] the Bible said who shall harm me
[1:00:35] hallelujah amen the Bible says if God's
[1:00:39] for me who can be against me praise God
[1:00:41] Amen and then he goes into this roller
[1:00:43] coaster of emotions it's a death threat
[1:00:45] no doubt he probably would have felt
[1:00:46] fear but he laughs it off and then verse
[1:00:49] 34 oh Jerusalem Jerusalem which kills
[1:00:52] the prophets and sest them that are sent
[1:00:54] unto to thee how often would I gather
[1:00:57] thy children together as a hen doth
[1:00:59] gather her root under her wings and he
[1:01:01] would not brother said this is the
[1:01:04] weeping prophet of
[1:01:05] Jeremiah Jeremiah wept over Jerusalem
[1:01:09] and Jeremiah was called the weeping
[1:01:10] prophet oh I'm sorry this is also David
[1:01:13] this is David when he was ousted out by
[1:01:16] Absalon David cried and he was weeping
[1:01:19] he lost his
[1:01:20] kingdom so look at the roller coaster of
[1:01:23] emotions
[1:01:24] Jesus goes from Fear laughing it off and
[1:01:28] then here he goes to weeping and crying
[1:01:30] because the people won't receive the
[1:01:31] word of God I offered it to them I
[1:01:34] preached it to them I lived it before
[1:01:36] them but they don't want it but here's a
[1:01:38] man who can control his City his City's
[1:01:41] protected Hallelujah those are all the
[1:01:43] right emotion God wants him to express
[1:01:45] God wants us to have that kind of
[1:01:47] emotion praise God compassion amen God
[1:01:50] wants us to have weeping God wants to
[1:01:52] have a good sense of humor he wants us
[1:01:54] to to rejoice and give thanks and be
[1:01:56] angry sometimes in hard Hearts God wants
[1:01:58] us to experience the Life of Christ
[1:02:00] hallelujah amen last one Proverbs 17
[1:02:02] this my last verse proverbs
[1:02:11] 17:22 I think that humor kind of goes in
[1:02:13] with this scripture don't you
[1:02:17] think a merry heart doeth good like a
[1:02:22] medicine sometimes humor makes you laugh
[1:02:24] right don't makes you feel a lot better
[1:02:26] there's sometimes I just need a really
[1:02:28] good
[1:02:29] laugh right I'm just like I can't wait
[1:02:31] till I can laugh my head off I just want
[1:02:34] to feel I just want to feel all the
[1:02:36] pressures off again I love when I laugh
[1:02:38] so hard till I cry those are the best
[1:02:41] laugh but that word medicine means a
[1:02:43] cure or remedy a merry heart is the cure
[1:02:47] to your mind battle and the church said
[1:02:49] am catch that amen a happy heart
[1:02:54] happiness in God is the
[1:02:57] remedy for a broken
[1:03:00] Spirit find something you can be happy
[1:03:03] about right have a sense of humor I'm
[1:03:05] not talking about evil sense of humor
[1:03:07] but good sense of
[1:03:09] humor but a broken Spirit dth the bones
[1:03:13] dry means to wither doesn't that remind
[1:03:15] you of Psalm chapter 1 if we're planted
[1:03:17] by rivers of water our leaves do not
[1:03:19] wither am amen how do I stay encouraged
[1:03:23] how do I how do I stay strong and fresh
[1:03:25] and beating on the word of God be
[1:03:27] happy Rejoice it's medicine to you amen
[1:03:31] amen it's the cure being happy in God
[1:03:34] hallelujah amen have a dance service

[1:03:47] as well by God's grace I like to have on
[1:03:50] that day or when I get some good sleep
[1:03:53] but it clearly shows us having joy
[1:03:55] happiness that is the cure to mind
[1:03:58] battles and and uh mind that that the
