========================================

You know, like Wednesday, we looked at uh we have thus sayeth the Lord and uh maybe more like of a review for some of us or maybe a teaching for some of us by God's grace. But I am so thankful church, I can go to a church that says, "I have thus sayith the Lord." We have thus sayeth the Lord from a prophet of God. Hallelujah. And they all line up. All 27 of them we went through line up with the scriptures. Praise God. But I like to go to uh Psalm 34:7. I like to just take a few services and look at the angel of the Lord. I want to look at that. I put a video out about it yesterday. U but I want to just try to just hand or handcrafted or craft it by the Holy Spirit for the local church here by God's grace. Looking up a verse here. So Psalm uh 34:7 familiar verse. How many appreciate this verse? Praise God. What a promise and encouragement this ought to be to us that we we have an angel that's not just going to be with us from time to time, maybe a couple times in our lives, but the angel is going to camp around us. Praise God. So, we have a constant messenger from the Lord that watches over our lives. What an encouragement this is. So, let's read this if we can on three. One, two, three. the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and deliverth him. The Bible says, "Don't forget all of his benefits." If you've ever been delivered, we have God to thank for it. And God sent his angel to deliver us. Uh may God add his blessing to the ring of his word. You can be seated here by God's grace. So, let's look at this thought here. Uh, by the grace of the Lord, I don't I mean, I have enough notes to preach. I said like a series, but we'll kind of see how uh it goes. I got my thoughts, you know, about where I'd like it to go. But, you know, as uh as I was looking back at my notes, I haven't spent a lot of time on angels, I would say, you know, my in my pastorship here. Um, the last time I think I preached on was back in 2020. I found one sermon from 2020 called Lessons from Angels. And I just kind of basically reviewed uh different types of angels on the video. Yesterday I put out uh there's at least six type of angels. But now, you know, if you go through and you look at different verses, I've I'm already up to eight now because you have destroying angels, you have the ceiling angel along with all these other types of angels. So, it's awesome to see how God has soldiers or angels for almost every situation we could go through. Aren't you glad for that? Hallelujah. God knows how to send angels. The Bible says in Hebrews, he has an innumerable number of angels. Hallelujah. So, we rejoice in that and we thank God for his uh love and mercy to give us these angels. Now, I want to just start with this thought uh about the angel of the Lord. I think it'd be best, you know, to start with this thought. Just like when I preached on the mysteries, I started with the Godhead because God is the most important mystery of all mysteries. And the church said, &gt;&gt; you know, God, if there is a mystery that that that's worth looking into, we know all of them are worth looking into, but if there's one mystery that's greater than all of them, it would be God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God is the creator. Hallelujah. God is our savior. Hallelujah. God is our provider. So, I want to look at uh today we'll look at for the majority of our time, we'll look at the angel of the Lord. As I said, there are six or maybe eight or more different types of angels and we'll take some services here and we'll try to look at these here by the grace of God. The angel of the Lord is the most important angel because this is God in a angelic form. This is not we'd say Michael, Gabriel, any other lower class angel, but the angel of the Lord is God himself in angelic form. Hallelujah. Now if you remember the capital L O R D there, the angel of the Lord, the capital Lord uh refers to Jehovah or Yhovah in the the Hebrew and this means the selfexisting one. So this is the messenger of the self-existing one. This is God. Hallelujah. This is God coming down as his own messenger. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Random dramatized it uh well with the three Hebrew children. You remember that drama brother Rand did with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Remember that? It's been a while since we looked at that, but Brother Random said Shadrach and Meshach and Abed Abednego were going to the towards the fiery furnace. And brother Ram said they didn't need a prayer meeting because they already prayed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Ram said while they're being taken there, Brother Ram said all the angels were reporting back to him and saying, "Lord, your three servants are going to be tossed in the fire. I'll go." And brother Ram dramatized. Gabriel said, "I'll go." Michael said, "I'll go." And all the angels were trying to interject their thoughts and say, "Well, I'll go." And brother Ram dramatized it and says, "That's okay, angels. This is a God-sized job." &gt;&gt; And God, Brother Ram said, "God said, I'm going to go myself and deliver my Hebrew, my Hebrew children." Praise God. And then the Bible says that Nebuchadnezzar looked there in the fire and he saw three, but then he saw one like unto the son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that was God himself. Brother Chris, I don't know if they were brothers or not. That's a good question. I don't know. Good question. But God himself, brothers, uh, brother Ram said God himself wanted to come down and deliver his children. Hallelujah. And the angel Lord encamps around us and delivers us. Hallelujah. So the angel Lord comes down and delivers sometimes God himself at times whenever it speaks of an angel that's likened unto the son of God uh in the days of Daniel there. Other times it's referring to God in angel form. And so church, what would that mean? That would mean the invisible God created a theophony. That would be the logos, right? The Holy Spirit. And God, the invisible God came inside his presence. Came inside that visible logos. And then made a angelic image, right? A body, angelic body, theophony body, and came down to earth and made himself visible unto mortals like us. Wretched mortals like us. Amen. God allowed himself to be seen and delivered. Hallelujah. And he delivered wretched mortals like us. That shows, church, we serve a living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That proves we serve a loving God, a God who loves us, a God that will come down himself and minister to the people. Praise God. Now, I want to just make sure I read this quote here uh from Brother Brandham. I started the video with this uh yesterday. In 1955, Brother Ram was preaching on how the angel came to me in Chicago. And he says, "I'm saying this with permission, I believe, from the Holy Spirit. The angel of the Lord that comes is not the Lord Jesus. He said for uh it doesn't look like him in the same vision. For the vision I saw the Lord Jesus, he was a little man. So brother Ram says he's seen the Lord three times. I found two of them. I need to keep searching. Jose and I were searching a couple weeks ago uh where brother Ram had seen the Lord Jesus. Brother Ram saw him when he was a a a newly saved Christian when he was out praying for his father in a sage bush field. He was out praying in the nighttime and then he looked over and he saw Jesus and then uh he cried out to Jesus and then he passed out. He woke up the next morning. That was the first time he saw the Lord Jesus. And then in 1960 he saw the Lord Jesus after he had the sinus infection and he missed some meetings. He had a nine-day sinus infection and he missed meetings and he he asked his wife, you know, am I even called to the ministry and he said his wife rebuked him a little bit and said, "Don't say such things as that." Uh but then brother Ram had a vision of the Lord Jesus and uh it was basically a vision of the third pole and that that the Lord Jesus was was uh was showing him the promised land. In other words, the promised land was the third step for Joshua. And so the Lord Jesus was showing brother Brandham the third pole of his ministry. Praise God. And so those are the two times. And brother Ram said there's three times he's seen him. So I need to find that third time. But I want you to notice that that brother Ram says when the angel of the Lord would come on the platform, he said it would always stand on the right side of the platform. So the angel would stand on this side. And the angel would then show uh the secrets of the thoughts intents of the heart. Show him visions of the of the patients that were in line. And brother Brandon says that angel is not the Lord Jesus. Okay? Because it looked different. He said the Lord Jesus, he says, was a little man. He said, a white garment on, his arms folded like this and a beard, a short beard, hair down to his shoulders. So, brother Ram said the the vision of the Lord Jesus looked mostly like this, but he had a white uh garment on, a little fellow. He said, but the angel that came to him, he describes it like this, a big large man weighing about 200 lb. I've said he looks a lot like Malachi's physical size and he has dark hair down to the shoulder and he said he had no beard and then he would look he would fold his arms too and just look at brother Brandham that's how Billy Paul describes him as well so brother Brandham said that was the angel that was commissioned to him his whole life dark hair about 200 lb a big man dark hair down to his shoulders and so brother says you know that when that angel comes you know brother would have to wait for And you say he's here. Brother Bam said he's here. He said don't fear that. He said that's just the angel of the Lord. Okay. So that was an angel, a separate angel, not the Lord Jesus in theophony form. That was a separate angel that would come down that was commissioned to brother Brandham. He said from my birth. Hallelujah. So this is what we would say like a guardian angel. Right? A guardian angel commissioned to brother Brandon from his birth. And he was not the Lord Jesus, but he was an angel of the Lord. Okay, so I just want to I thought I'd share that. But then church, I found quotes. There are quotes where brother Ram says that the Lord Jesus did come down himself. Hallelujah. Brother Ram said in Houston Coliseum in 1960, I'm sorry, 1950 during the debate with Dr. Best and brother Bosworth, brother Random said that uh that angel, he said that same pillar of fire that followed the children of Israel, the same thing here today, the same Christ. Any Bible student knows that's the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness was the angel of the covenant Christ, the the logos that went out from God in the beginning. He said, "And that logos was made flesh and dwelt in a human body here on earth named Jesus." Look what it did then. Look what it did when it come down in some flesh and talked to Abraham. Look what it did when it was here on earth that walked in Galilee. What it did? Well, here it is back again tonight dwelling in all of us. The universal church doing the same thing. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Think about that. The same logos that went out from God was the same logos that met Abraham. The same logos that melt met Jacob and Moses and Joshua and Paul and now and the same God that was in Jesus said now that same logos is with us here tonight. Hallelujah. So church catch that. There's times the angel of the Lord would be there just a regular angel brother's angel would be there but then there's times the Lord Jesus would show up as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. And church, that matches the scripture because uh many times when there's more than one believer, there's numerous angels that are with the people of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Elisha told his servant, he said, "There's there's more that's with us than that's with this Syrian army." &gt;&gt; And he prayed, "God, open the eyes of Gahesa. Open the eyes of your servant." And the Bible said, "Ghesa open up his eyes. He looked at the mountains. And the mountains were full of chariots of fire. The mountains were full of angels. In other words, God backs up his prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. God backs up his people. Hallelujah. So, we know that, you know, it matches the scripture when you have more than one believer. You had Elisha and Gahaza. And I don't know how often God sends a whole host of army angels. I don't know how often he does that. But with the prophet Elisha, he sent a whole army of angels. And the Bible calls him the Lord of hosts is with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord of And we sing he's the God of angel armies. Hallelujah. He's always by my side. Hallelujah. Oh, what a blessing to know, church, that the angel of the Lord is here today. Hallelujah. So, the Lord Jesus, if his if his holy presence would be with us today, we'd be so privileged. But we also know that each one of us have an angel with us throughout our whole lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we have we have at least that knowledge. Praise God. That there's an angel that camps around us and it's here to deliver us. Now church, that's we know we know that's physical deliverance. We also know it's spiritual deliverance. And we'll prove that by the end by God's grace. So church, if anybody feels here today you need deliverance, the angel of the Lord is here to deliver. Now, some we could all I I would like it if we could all go down through our lives and just think when did I get delivered from fear? When did I get delivered from uh lust or or or stress or or anxiety or uh covet covetousness? And if if you think deeply on that, you'll find if you got delivered, it was God sending his angel to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because remember it was it was the angel's wrestling in order Michael had to come in and step in the wrestling match in order to bring deliverance to Daniel because Daniel wanted to know the timing of God. So it was the angel that brought the word of deliverance or the word of knowledge to Daniel when he was seeking for it. &gt;&gt; And church if you're seeking for something God angel is here for you to help you receive it. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I like what brother Simon preached last week. I think it was timely with the approach. Hallelujah. If we take the right approach to God, God will uh God will reveal himself to us and be able to deliver us on what we have need of. Hallelujah. So, I think of Adam's testimony and next next Sunday night is Rod's testimony. Brother Rods, for those who can make it, next Sunday night at 3 p.m., he'll give his testimony. But I think of Adam's testimony and how, you know, he had been so deep and demonpossessed, but then he had to go to that 30-day uh deliverance ministry. But then he finally came to that day, right? He finally came to that day where God delivered him. And that was the angel of the Lord, right? So the angel Lord drove out that demon power of cocaine or heroin or marijuana whatever it may be that the that that that that angel power because the angels hold the presence of God. The prince of God commanded that evil spirit to leave. &gt;&gt; God brought deliverance. The angel Lord brought deliverance. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And then we heard his testimony. For years he had to fight to get other types of victory. And then church, while he was here last month, the angel of the Lord gave him another victory. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While he was here, who is here to give him victory? It's not brother Jesse. &gt;&gt; It's not brother so and so or sister so and so. It's the angel of the Lord that's here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's angel is here to drive away demon powers. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And deliver his people. And church, we just need reminders of it. We just need an awareness of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, but now I want to shift back to the angel of the Lord, God in angelic form. Now, I'm just hitting the highlights. Uh I could I could be wrong on some of these, but the first time we see the angel lord is uh Genesis 22. So, if you have your Bibles, let's go there. And there could be before this, you know, of course, we see the cherubam uh in in Genesis 3, we see the angels guarding the tree of life. But here with the angel of the Lord, Genesis 22:15. Now, Abraham's in quite a spot, but remember, as brother Diggs preached to us, Abraham's faith was skyhigh at this point. Hallelujah. He'd lied to twice the kings about his wife. Should have had his his wife and his life taken, and yet God had restored it back to him. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. So if anybody should have believed that that they were on God's side, it should have been Abraham. &gt;&gt; But then God tells Abraham, "Go sacrifice your son, your only son." Yet he had Ishmael. &gt;&gt; So God recognized that Isaac was the promised son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the only son. Amen. The only real son is the promised son. Hallelujah. The promised word. And so Abraham, no doubt he's no doubt, even though he's got a promise. Remember, and remember church, he's got the profession that God can do a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Remember early in the chapter, he said, "You stay here. I the lad will come back and will come again to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had resurrection faith that yes, God might have me strike him down, but God will raise him up. Amen. &gt;&gt; But anyways, no doubt as a father, even without the baptism of the Holy Ghost, think about us parents, even without the baptism of the Holy Ghost, how much we're we have fear about we want our children to live long lives and be safe and not get any accidents, right? And not h how much do we care as as human parents with the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Well, look at Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham had the promise. So no doubt what I'm saying is he would have felt some human emotion about this, &gt;&gt; right? But as he raises his knife, the Bible said, "The angel of the Lord called in Abraham out of heaven the second time and said, uh, by myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord." No, I'm sorry. I I got the wrong verse. It's verse 10 and 11. And Abram stretched forth his hand and took a knife to slay his son. Verse 11. And the angel Lord called on him out of heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here am I." So we get that beautiful picture again. Who steps down to save Isaac, the angel of the Lord. Just like he stepped down, didn't he step down to deliver Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo? It's the same God stepping down again to deliver Abraham's seed. And church, you ought to rejoice that he saved Abraham's seed, Isaac. But you also ought to rejoice that you're the seed of Abraham. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he will deliver you. Hallelujah. I think of all the car accidents I could have been in that could have ended my life. Even uh two weeks ago when when I got news that Charlie Kirk had been shot. On my drive home, I'm driving. I just had heard the news. I don't know if I told I told my wife, but I didn't tell anybody else. I'm driving all and all I see all of a sudden I see this Chevy Suburban huge car, right? A maroon one. It swerves into my lane. It's coming right at me. And I'm like, honk honk. And I see the person look up from their phone and like and just barely miss me. I just heard about death, right? And I'm I'm like, what in the world's going on? And then death is knocking right on my door. But church, what is it? The angel Lord is there to deliver us. &gt;&gt; An angel woke that guy up. That it was a guy. The angel woke that guy up and swerved him at right the right time. &gt;&gt; He wasn't Now look, church. He wasn't drunk. He wasn't high because he was able to be alert. &gt;&gt; But it just reminded me again, you know, death could happen at any time. So, we want to be ready to go. Praise God. &gt;&gt; But we also have the promise we won't leave here one second before God says it's time to go. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because the angel's there. God's angel is with you to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Pardon me. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I spit too much. So, forgive me. So we can see that even uh my life I can see just within a few weeks ago and I told you the story in college where the my friend was going 99 or 100 miles per hour in a little geometro or whatever it was and he got out of control. We slid four four lanes across I76 right there by Goodyear the Goodyear headquarters and came to a perfect stop uh by the concrete wall. And as soon as we stopped I saw all these 18-wheelers pass us. It was the angel of God holding them back, right? And let and and and and causing us I'm only 19 20 years old there. I think I was 20 years old. 19 maybe. And the car wasn't damaged now. The tires were blown out or whatever. They we couldn't drive it after that, but we were able to walk to practice and sadly I had to go to practice, but but I can recognize someone delivered me there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone held back vehicles and someone brought our car to a perfect stop so I didn't have one hair singed or one hair damaged. &gt;&gt; Right? What are the chances of going 100 miles per hour and spinning numerous times and stopping right next to the concrete wall? &gt;&gt; It's God's angel there to deliver us. &gt;&gt; In other words, there was more life for me to have. I was supposed to have a Malachi, an acacia, an Lydia. I was my life. God wasn't done with me yet. I was supposed to preach the gospel. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I was supposed to preach to you on September, was it 23rd or 20 21st 2025 about the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; so that you'll recognize the angel of the Lord and you'll be thankful for the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we see the angel of God delivering the seed of Abraham just like the angel Lord delivers you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the Abraham calls this place Jehovah Gyra. For in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen. The Lord is seen. The Lord has provided a sacrifice. Now here's where as I said in verse 15 and 16, here's where we get that this is God in an angel. And he said in verse 16, by myself I have sworn. Now church, an angel can't swear by himself. An angel has to swear by the Lord. We're we're taught that in the book of Hebrews. But God, there's nobody greater than him. So, he has to swear by himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He can only make a promise by himself. For because thou has done this thing and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I'll multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven. And as the sand which is upon the seashore, thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice. Church, obey the voice of God, and God will bless your seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you want God to bless you or your family or your future family, if our brothers, you know, one day get married, if you want God to bless your family, then obey the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God brings a voice to remembrance or or I'm sorry, when God brings a scripture to your remembrance, God tells you to do something, you know, it's the word of God, obey it and God will bring blessing upon blessing into your life. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm preaching on blessings. Hallelujah. I'm enjoying the amens. Hallelujah. So, this is an angel speaking with divine authority. This is God in angel form. This is not a cherub. This is not a saraphim. This is not a watcher. This is not the ceiling angel. This is not the destroying angel. This is God in angel form. &gt;&gt; Now, the second time we see this, at least me that I've studied so far. The second time I've seen him is at Jacob. And I just preached on this a few weeks ago about wrestling. We wrestle not against flesh and blood. So, let's go to Genesis 32. We could do a second round on this here by God's grace. Now verse uh 30 chapter 32 verse 24 he's left alone and he starts wrestling and as I said I I didn't know if this was the angel Lord or not but it seems like it is the angel of the Lord. So he wrestles and he wants to know the angel but it's a secret uh down in verse 29. And Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name. Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. So, in other words, God was hiding the name of Jesus until the time when Jesus was conceived in the womb of Mary. Amen. And then the first time his name was spoken, John the Baptist leaped in his mother's womb. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, church, we ought to just rejoice and bless that wonderful name of Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Look at verse 30. And Jacob called the name of the place Pineal for I've seen God face to face and my life is preserved. So this is the angel Lord. And yeah what I forgot to say also about the angel Lord. Brother Ram says the angel Lord is the covenant angel. Brother Random says I read it earlier which means God shows up when he's working with somebody in a covenant situation. Now church remember there's only eight covenants. Now, thank God, brother uh remember Paul Griffin, remember he came in here and he said, "I I never met many people who thought there was eight covenants, but brother Jesse wrote about in his book." So, we were in one accord all these years. He's a what, a 60some year old man, and God put us in one accord by God's grace. But in other words, the angel of the Lord is the covenant angel. Now, how many know that God gave Abraham a covenant? It's in Genesis 12. Then he repeats it in Genesis 15. And then he brings them circumcision covenant in Genesis 17. How many know that &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm going to make a covenant with you." So when God made covenants with individuals, then God himself would come down as an angel and confirm the covenant. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you remember God made the covenant to Abraham, but it just wasn't to Abraham only. It was to Abraham, Isaac, and so that's why God comes down himself. God comes himself to meet with Jacob. This, as I said, church, this ain't just Michael. This ain't Gabriel, which I still don't know what kind of angel Gabriel is. I'm still trying to figure that out. Of course, we know Michael's an archangel. I still don't know what kind of angel Gabriel is. Is he a Is he a watcher angel? Is he a cherub? But it seems like the cherubs stay by the throne of God. They always guard the throne of God. He wouldn't be a saraphim because he's not bringing the fire like was brought to Isaiah. So I imagine he's a watcher angel, but I'm not certain. But it's uh but we see this here that that Jacob gets alone with God. He wrestles with God and God lets him win. Oh church, what a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I love this church. After Jacob gets the wrestling match and he wins it, he doesn't have to tell anybody that he wrestled an angel. Think about that. He went to Esau the next chapter. He doesn't have to tell Esau, "Look at me. I'm a big man. I wrestled an angel, &gt;&gt; church. They could just look at him and say, "He limped." Right? So, they could just look at him and say, "Jacob has a different walk, &gt;&gt; right? And we know that that's how we walk. The Bible said we walk in the newness of the spirit." Thank God we don't have limps. &gt;&gt; Now, we might later on, Brother Vang, as we get older. I'm getting up there. You might have one later on. But Jacob didn't have to go around bragging about it. He just look, everybody could see he had a different walk. That's how it is when you get the Holy Ghost. When you get the Holy Ghost, you don't have to tell people about it. They'll see a difference in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. When you get the Holy Ghost, people will see, wow, that brother acts different. &gt;&gt; That sister acts different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, of course, you'll testify about it because remember on the day of Pentecost, they what? They got the Holy Ghost. What' they do? They said, "Oh, he's so wonderful. God is so wonderful. Jesus died on the cross. He's He's raised again. He sent the Holy Ghost. God is doing wonderful works. Now his spirit is here. The comforter is here. Now I got the spirit of Jesus in me. The Messiah is in me. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is in me." That was a sign they were born again as well &gt;&gt; because they could tell people the wonderful works of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And before they were hiding up in a attic, we'd say upper room, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So see church, if you get the Holy Ghost, you'll go back to your work or you'll go back to your home or you'll go back to your school girls, right? or your homeschool and they will know something's different about this person. &gt;&gt; Because you'll be declaring the wonderful works of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. So notice this is God himself as the angel of the Lord and he comes to Jacob because Jacob has the covenant and God won't let that covenant fail. Wow. If God gives you a covenant, God won't let that covenant fail. God will make sure you keep that covenant because no man can keep it. So if God gives it, God has to make sure it's carried out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now, what's interesting is Hosea 12:4. In case you if you got your Bible, you can turn there. If not, uh, turn to Exodus chapter 3. Exodus 3 is a lot closer, but Hosea 12:4. This is speaking again of Jacob. Yay. He had power over the angel and prevailed. In other words, God let Israel or Jacob have uh God let him win the victory. In other words, God let him just beg and wrestle and fight until he got what he wanted. &gt;&gt; In other words, God let him pray until God said, "Okay, I'm going to give you what you want." &gt;&gt; But Jacob is not stronger than God. God just really wanted to see that he wanted a change in his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then God blessed him. So see church, listen. There are times you have to plead with God for whatever blessing you want in your life &gt;&gt; because Jacob had to do it. Right. But I can show you also there's other times God will just do miracles for people. It's like they didn't even pray for. And brother Ham says that in works his faith expressed 1965. He said some people got to struggle for it. He said others is just given to them and there's hardly any effort to it at all. &gt;&gt; So church, listen, don't be jealous of people that get blessings. It seems like easy. &gt;&gt; Either you'll get one of those or you'll wrestle for yours. But listen, God knows what kind of blessings you need. &gt;&gt; God knows if you're weak and struggling, he might just give you a blessing. &gt;&gt; Or you might be weak and struggling and God might make you wrestle for that blessing so you won't be weak and struggling anymore. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "See that God knew Jacob need to overcome fear." So he had to really get a supernatural experience with God. He had to plead with God. He had to he had to just spend time with God until he got what he needed. And he knew he could prevail. If he could prevail against God, well, surely I could prevail against Esau, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; But it's God letting Jacob win. All right. And he wept and made supplication. Oh, I forgot about that. See, church, there's times God wants you to weep and cry it out and then God will give you what you have need of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something about crying when you're praying, church. There's something about crying when you pray. God loves that so much because look, we got it here. He gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost in type. But we also get it in Ezekiel 9 where the Bible said, "Mark all those that sigh and cry for the abominations done in this city." &gt;&gt; And God God lets the writer with the inkorn mark him on his on their foreheads. And brother Ram said, "How many houses do you think tonight in Jeffersonville?" Let me bring it down here. How many houses in Akran or Fire is it Firestone? You live in Firestone. &gt;&gt; What was it? &gt;&gt; Cam Cameron. Kenmore, I'm sorry. Kenmore. Yeah. Sorry. How many houses in Kenmore are people praying against all the abortions and the trans surgeries and the murders? How many were praying last night? Brother Ram says, &gt;&gt; in other words, who could God have marked last night in your home? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I just say like this. If I didn't do my home last night, I'm going to do it in church today. &gt;&gt; And I did. This morning, I did. &gt;&gt; I was crying and I was crying for all the abominations done in Akran. Hallelujah. There's something about that God loves when people hate sin &gt;&gt; and cry, God will mark them with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's also something when you pray and you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you cry for it. God, we should shed tears for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm looking at brother Chris because he's been praying for it. You should you brother, you should pray until you cry for it. And then I got a good feeling God will give you the Holy Ghost. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if it happens, we'll all know it happened &gt;&gt; because we'll see your life afterwards. Something's changed about that brother. Something's changed about that sister. All right. So now we can see the angel Lord, Abraham, Jacob, because the covenant was connected to them. The covenant of God's people, right? Israel became God's people. Hallelujah. through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and down down through the line even to this day. Praise God. The people of Israel. Now, the next one is Moses. Exodus chapter 3. Moses is on the back side of the mountain or back side of the desert rather. And in verse two, the angel Lord appeared in him. That's the angel of Jehovah. We'll say the angel of the self-existing one. This ain't just a regular angel. This is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God comes out in the angel form. He appears unto him in the flame of a fire of the midst of the bush. And he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed. I love how sight and sound picked that up. They had a bush that was burning but it wasn't consumed. And that's what Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego could say the same thing. We were in a fire not consumed. &gt;&gt; Right? Because men are like trees. Ah, amen. In other words, the bush was like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, right? And God's fires there, they're not burning, right? And God's fires here, they're not burning. God knows how to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God doesn't need lessons on, I wonder how I could work this out, this formula, how to deliver brother so- and so or sister so- and so. God don't need any ideas on that. He's already got it figured out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's his angel. He's going to send his angel. Hallelujah. And the angel will deliver you. Now we know this is the angel of the Lord. Verse uh here he says uh yeah the Lord verse four. And when the Lord saw that yeah the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses. And he said here am I. Doesn't that sound familiar? Abraham, Abraham, Moses, Moses, Samuel, Samuel. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; So, be listening in your in your dream, church. Be listening. If God calls your name, he's probably going to call it twice. Haven, Haven, Chris, Chris, Malachi, Malachi. That's how God likes to call names twice. One time I was preaching in line. My brother Vang might have been there. And uh before service we were praying and uh sister Karen Sanders let out this scream and she said, "I am here. I am here. God is here. I am here." And I preached I don't remember what message it was, brother Vang. At the end at the end of that message, sister Karen got under the spirit again and called out, "Alahoo, alahu." Do you remember that brother? I don't know if you remember that. I I I faintly remember him coming up to the altar and that brother is brother Brooks's son come up to the altar and she basically to gave him some different warnings about what he was doing the night before. But I remember that because it was alahu alahu. It was twice just like here. Moses Moses. Hallelujah. Now what should our answer be? If it's vang vang what should our answer be? Here I am. Here's your servant. Praise God. I'm reporting. Amen. I'm reporting to my duty, my my post of duty. What do you want your servant to know? Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember, I preached on death recently. Now, and then the your father passed that night. So, I I not I'm not saying this is going to happen, but let's be watching this week if God would speak to us in a dream or some other way because I don't I didn't really plan to preach on this till last night. I was going to preach on God hiding himself in simplicity. I've got I've got a bride age sermon, sister. I got a bride age sermon ready for you and your sister your sisters, but I was just waiting for the right timing. I just kind of felt inspired by this because I wanted to encourage the people that the angel of the Lord camps around you. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said that angel of the Lord Jesus Christ was setting in that bush the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness. And any teacher knows that the angel of the covenant was Jesus Christ. So brother Ram says it's Jesus Christ calling out Moses, Moses. And that's right because in the book of Hebrews, the Bible says that Moses uh served God or he forsook everything for the sake of Christ. So brother Chris, it says that. Let's read that. Let's keep your place there. I'd like to show that to brother Chris. Uh keep your place in Exodus 3. Go to Hebrews 11. And that just came to me now as a review or reminder from the Holy Spirit. I I hope if you can find that, let me know. Here we'll go down to Moses. Yeah, there it is, brother. Verse 26. 11:26. Brother Chris. So, see this proves God in the Old Testament was Jesus Christ. And the church said, &gt;&gt; brother said, "The God Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New." Amen. Not a second person, not a different person. It's the same God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not a second person. It's Jesus Christ. God. Jesus Christ is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Chris, this proves it right here. Esteeming the reproach of who? &gt;&gt; Christ. So, Moses valued the reproach of Christ. It was is more valuable and than the greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. Who is Moses following? Christ. Who is Christ? The anointed. The anointed of the Holy Ghost, the angel of the Lord. In other words, the logos, brother. He has seen the reproach of the logos, the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Greater than the riches of Christ. Hallelujah. Is that is that becoming more clear to everybody? Whenever you see the angel Lord all throughout the Old Testament, it's Jesus, &gt;&gt; not the body that was conceived in Mary, but it's the spirit of God. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense, brother Chris? Is that okay? Amen. So, other words, Jesus was talking to Moses in the burning bush. And then Jesus talked to Moses and Elijah on Mount Transfiguration. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. Moses would have been like, "Oh yeah, I've seen you before." Hallelujah. This is God. This is God and a man. Hallelujah. I've seen him before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Same man, same spirit, same God, same character, same nature. I'm the Lord thy God. I'm the Christ of God and I change not. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I &gt;&gt; feel like preaching now. Amen. Hallelujah. Go back to uh well, since we're here, go to 1 Corinthians 10. We'll show brother Chris another proof of that just because he's fresh to the message here. It's uh 1 Corinthians 10:4. And did all drink the same spiritual drink, speaking of Israel in the days of Moses, for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them. And that rock was Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. The same God. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8. Brother Brandham said that was Jesus Christ. The angel Lord out of the speaking out of the burning bush was Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Now back to Exodus 3. Hopefully you got one of those uh bookmarks like I do in my Bible. Verse five. And he said, "Draw not nigh hither. put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereupon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover, he said, I am the God of sorry, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, the God of Jacob. See the covenant he's keeping his covenant with the Israeli people. He's and this is the angel of the Lord. This is God and an angel making sure his covenant is kept. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God. Amen. Now I love down I love in verse 13. Moses says, "Who do I say that sent me?" Go to verse 14. And God and said unto Moses, I am that I am. Amen. And then brother Chris Jesus told the Pharisees before Abraham was I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So Jesus tells the Pharisees, "I was the I am that talked to Moses." And so that means I was before Moses and I was before Abraham. &gt;&gt; I'm the God of eternity. Jesus was telling them, "I am God in flesh." &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise God. Hallelujah. Oh my. I am that I am. And he said, "Thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent me unto you." God's name is I am. Hallelujah. So now we see what that's three. Three angels of the Lord. Let me give you another one. A fourth one. Joshua. Joshua chapter 5:E 13. We preach the whole book of Joshua by God's grace. So this ought to this ought to be able to draw on a little bit of your long-term memory here. By God's grace. Verse 13. And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lift up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went unto him and said unto him, "Art thou for us or for our adversaries? Are you on our side or the enemy's side?" And he said, "Nay, neither." Amen. I'm not taking sides with anybody. In other words, I'm God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got to be on my side. Hallelujah. But as the captain of the host of the Lord, I am now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship. See, now if he wasn't God, God would have said, "Don't worship me. Don't worship angels." But this captain let Joshua worship him. So this captain was more than just a man, more than an angel. It was God in angel form &gt;&gt; because he accepted worship. And the church said, And he said unto him, "What saith my lord unto his servants?" So look now, now it's not about whose side you're on. Now it's like, "Oh, that's right. I'm your servant." This isn't my war. This is God's war. &gt;&gt; Church, your battles aren't your battles. They're God's battles. &gt;&gt; You and I, we're nobody special. So we should not make it out like this is my life and my journey and this is my great adventure. This is God's plan for our lives. &gt;&gt; Look at Charlie Kirk. We we all would have thought he would have been the president someday. But see, God's got different ideas for than what we have. &gt;&gt; Right? 31 years old, God said, "That's good." Like I told Malachi, at 31 years old, God would have told the devil, "It's okay. Go ahead and take his life." But actually, the angels will be there to take the to pack his soul to heaven. See church, that's why we cry so much because we thought, wow, we we think there's so much m potential for people, young people that die. But God's ways are better than our ways. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we have to look at this like this isn't my war. This isn't my life. This isn't my battle. I'm just here for God's glory. We need that perspective, right, sister? We need the job perspective that I'm just here because I'm just doing God's service. Nothing special about me. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Oh, you're the bride. You're the greatest Christians ever." All these things. No, no. I I'm nobody. I'm just here to do God's service. &gt;&gt; I'm God's servant. &gt;&gt; I'm nobody great. I'm nobody special. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse 15. And the captain of the Lord's host said unto him, "Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place where on thou standest is holy." And Joshua did so. So brother said, "This is Joshua getting his Moses moment." This is Joshua getting his burning bush moment. And brother Ram said, "All of us need a burning bush experience." &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Where you can learn more about God in five minutes than four years at a seminary." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You need an experience with God where you wrestle with God. You you feel God's presence. You know God presence. And when you become born again, then you'll act like a servant, not like a boss. &gt;&gt; Now, as a pastor, I'm I have to lead, right? As as a pastor, I have to lead the church like a shepherd leads the flock. Brother says, "Somebody's got to make the decisions around here, &gt;&gt; right?" He said, "Any any person with two heads would be a monster," he says. &gt;&gt; Right? So just like a just like a flock has to has one leader, a pastor has to have one leader. And church, you all know this, a family has to have one leader, too. That's the way God sets it up. Hallelujah. But what we need, we need experience with God that we can that that now as leaders, especially our husbands and husbands of families and pastors, that we don't look at ourselves as some big buddy, but how can I serve the people of God? That's why I chose to preach this sermon today because I thought it might help you more. I want to try to serve you. In my mind, I want to get my s my my my my series done, Brother Mercy. I'd like to get the God hiding himself done and Corinthians, but I'm trying to think of how can I serve the people? What would bless the saints today? What would further Claude and Patrick's experience with God today? Hallelujah. So I thought well maybe the angel of the Lord would encourage brother mercy today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said the Joshua the angel Lord that led Israel is the Lord Jesus Christ. So Joshua met the Lord Jesus Christ standing there brother Chris that's the Lord Jesus Christ. Same God that Moses met. Same God that Jacob wrestled with. Amen. Same God that Abraham talked to. same God all the time. It's the angel of the Lord. It's the God angel. I'll say it like that. Everybody got that? Now, here's here's the next one. I got a couple more here. I've only been preaching 43 minutes. Praise God. Amen. We got plenty of time. You I'm looking at people. Sometimes we look a little tired or quiet. That's okay. I get tired and quiet at home, too. We're at a home church. Uh, but I just don't want I don't want to take you too long here. Uh, like like brother Ram said, some people fill up easy. They just need a little preaching and then everything after that. But some, brother Ram said, some people fill up long, too. Some people got a big cup and they like to hear a lot about the word. Hallelujah. I guess brother Irvin, my wife said when brother Irvin was here, he says, he says, "Everybody's got a cup, but you just don't want to if if you put too much in there, it just overflows." He said something like that. But that's what the Bible says. My cup runth over. So if you get an extra long sermon, you're just fulfilling Psalm 23. &gt;&gt; My cup runs over. And the church said, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Acts 27:23. Now, we know this. Brother Ram said, "God gave the Old Testament to Moses, and he had an angel." And then, Brother Ram said, God interpreted the Old Testament, wrote the New Testament with I'm sorry, God gave the New Testament with Paul because Paul had an angel. And then this is in what uh what house will you build me 1965. Then brother Ram says he doesn't call himself but he says but then God sent me out to the desert as well to get the revelation of both the old testament and the new testament. So let me say that again a little more clearly. God sent Moses to the desert and met him in the desert and gave him the old testament. God sent Paul in the desert. Hallelujah. Desert of Arabia and gave him the New Testament. God sends brother Brandham to the desert in 1963 and gets the revelation of all of it. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Everybody catch that. So God wrote the Old Testament with Moses. God uh wrote the New Testament with Paul. God sends brother Bram to finish all the mysteries of all testaments. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Now, some churches, they'd be shouting over that church, just so you know. But maybe you've heard it before, or maybe you don't quite understand it. Well, maybe God will give you revelation in your time and season. Amen. Thank God. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, Paul is in a ship with prisoners and he would and that night in particular, he was in the bottom of the ship praying. And he says in verse 23, "For there stood be stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am." Now, that to me looks like it's the angel of the Lord Jesus Christ, but it could also mean his guardian angel. I'm just letting you know. I'm what I'm saying is I'm not certain on which angel this is. But either way, whatever angel this was, it told him, "Thus sayith the Lord, and it came to pass." &gt;&gt; Imagine that. All night Paul's down praying in the boat, and he comes up and he says, "The the angel of God, whose I belong to, and the angel I serve," said, "Fear not, Paul. Thou must be brought before Caesar, and lo, God given thee all them that sail with thee. Wherefore, sers, be of good cheer, for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told unto me. Imagine he's he comes up. He says, "Thus sayith the Lord, everyone that's in this boat is going to live." And church, there's been storms. They haven't eaten for 14 days, brother Chris. Two weeks, they haven't even eaten. They're just drinking water for 14 days. And he said, "Not one of you is going to lose your life. Thus sayith the Lord." Now, that's a real man of God right there. Amen. That man knows what he's talking about, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, he had an angel as well as angel guided him throughout his ministry. Now, we could go to Peter and all these things, but I forgot another Moses one. Let's go back to Exodus 32, church. I pardon me. I skipped over this. No, I'm sorry. It's Exodus 23. My My fault. I said it wrong. I've been putting all these numbers into my notes and they get mixed up sometimes. Exodus 23. verse 20. If you know this, this is uh Mount Si. They just got the the law on tables of stone in chapter 20. So, this is fresh uh uh fresh with a brand Well, I'm sorry, with a advanced covenant, the covenant, the of Mos Moses, the Mosaic covenant, right? The ten commands. They have a new covenant. Verse 20 23:20. Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way. Church, what a confirmation. Think of church. They're going to go through many wars, but how does God encourage him? He said, "You're going to fight many battles, but don't worry, the angels going before you." &gt;&gt; In other words, you have somebody, Brother Chris, going before you to make sure you get to where you're supposed to go. You have somebody going before you to make sure you can accomplish what I've called you to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. In other words, brother Mercy, I'm not in this alone, Brother Patrick. I'm not fighting this by myself. God's fighting for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he sent me supernatural help that I can keep pastoring my family and pastoring Bride of Christ Fellowship and you can find a job. Hallelujah. And have a family and get ready for the rapture. God sent his angel to get you there. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you like this, brother Mercy. An angel went before me to Akran because I didn't even know where Akran was on the map. Neither did Naomi and Beatatric. Amen. Neither did the Mong people know where Akran was. Right. God sent his angel to prepare the way. He prepared a place for you, a home for you. And not just a natural home, a spiritual home, a home church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many people have emailed me over the years and wish they had a home church they could go to? And they say, "Well, brother Justin, you're like my pastor uh because I don't have a home church." And I feel so sorry for them, but God's angel went before us to give us a physical home and a spiritual home. We ought to rejoice that God's angels are here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're going to make sure God's job, God's will is done in your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before the rapture, before you're taken home. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like brother Ram said, if they ever tell you, "Brother Ram's dead, don't believe him." He said, "Because I'm more alive than I've ever been." Amen. When Brother's soul and spirit left that body, he was more alive than he'd ever been. &gt;&gt; I think Billy Graham said that, too. If the word ever gets out, I've died. Don't believe him. I'm more alive. I'm in a better place, more alive. I got greater life. I've got eternal life. I'm more alive than I've ever been. &gt;&gt; And think of it. If we got the Holy Ghost, we got a portion and earnest of that right now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have a portion of that eternal life right now. It makes us rejoice and talk about the wonderful works of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, let his angels strengthen me to preach today. Amen. Like brother Brandham said, I'll get to that. So, church, the angel will keep you in the way God's called, God's sending you. He sent before you and to bring thee into the place which I prepared. Look, God already had a place prepared for us. Hallelujah. Verse 21. Beware of him and obey his voice. Provoke him not. In other words, grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed to the day of your redemption, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. Now, that just means you're going to be chasened. You're going to get spanked for what you do on this earth. Right? But your your sins are already forgiven in heaven, right? We talked about that with Job. Job had to live with his his fear that he let he let himself get a great fear. He spoke against God. He had to live with the consequences of his sins. But in heaven, he's already forgiven. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; In other words, glory. In other words, this life is the only time I'm going to have to deal with the consequences to my sin &gt;&gt; because the next life all my sin's been washed away. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a comfort to know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a blessing it would be then for us if if we die here. What a blessing it would be to know that where we're going, there's no punishment for sin. We just have to deal with it now. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And I love that. I will be an enemy to your enemies. Listen, church. God will not be mocked. &gt;&gt; If you're doing what's right, God will fight for you and he'll be against the people that are against you. Right? &gt;&gt; Doesn't the Bible say God will silence all the voices that try to speak out against you? I believe &gt;&gt; I don't I'm not quoting that exactly. &gt;&gt; But think about that, church. You have not you don't have to fight for yourself. God will fight for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now look at verse uh 23. For mine angels should go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, the Jebusites, and I will cut them off, the Leoites. I'll just say like that. All the demon powers we got to drive out. Okay. Now, oh, actually, you know what? Let's let me encourage you. Go down to verse 30. Let's read that, church. Here's what I hope for today. I hope somebody today just gets a little victory today. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope somebody gets a if you needed a full deliverance, that's available today, too. because the angel's here encamps around you to deliver you. &gt;&gt; But God but God told Moses, "My angel's going to go before you." And he said, "Little by little, I'll drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land." &gt;&gt; That's what you should expect from every service, brother Nia. A little more strength, a little more victory, &gt;&gt; and then we get we get extra blessings. Some services we get a tremendous amount of help or we get or like Adam gets delivered from a 27-year addiction. Amen. Praise God. That's more than a little. That's a lot. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's a greater blessing. That's a greater portion of Holy Ghost uh blessing by the grace of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But your promise every day, every service, you get a little stronger, brother Mercy. &gt;&gt; I get a little stronger in the high schools. Right, Claude and Patrick? Right, Anna? get a little stronger in the middle school when I'm when I'm walking in God's plan for my life. &gt;&gt; Right, brother Chris? A little stronger on the job. Hallelujah. Every day he said, "A little by little, I'll give you a little more power, little more strength, little more boldness." Right, Malachi? On the job, I'll give you a little more every time. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It took me uh it took me 10 years before I started Bible club. So, Brother Bank, it took a little courage, a little courage every year until I had enough courage to do Bible club in the public schools. I thought, "Oh, they're going to sue me. Oh, they're going to kick me out." It's been nothing but a blessing. Praise God. Hallelujah. But, see, it's a little bit of courage. A little more. A little more. A little more. And now I don't care what anybody says. I used to be afraid, Brother Chris. What are people going to say about him? What What What are they going to do when he doesn't laugh? Now I don't even care. I've got God's given us victory upon victory. He's making us go higher and higher. The light is shining more bright unto the perfect day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's little victory after little victory. Just get some victory today. &gt;&gt; What can you learn today? Write that down and focus on that. What's the one thing out of all this hourl long sermon? What's the one thing you can put into practice tomorrow? What little victory could you get today? I'm talking about a victory. I'm talking about gaining ground, right? What ground can you gain on the devil today? That's what I want you to have. Praise God. How many want that by God's grace? &gt;&gt; This is God. So, we see Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, St. Paul, and I like this one. This one applies to us, brother Brandham. Let's go to Revelation chapter 10. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. And I preached this. Remember a couple months ago, I preached this or a couple weeks I said, "Wait till I preach on the angel Lord." I didn't know it was going to happen today till yesterday. Oh, there's an hour. Okay. Glory. One more to go. Brother Chris. Amen. I know. I app I know. I appreciate Chris's Chris's testimonial. He don't he's the only one in this family that's serving God. What imagine what peace he must experience. Praise God. Chris being raised in the world, raised around all that sin and brother, now you come into the house of God. What peace you must experience. Hallelujah. Yeah, I also do. That's right. Amen. I love it. I love it. Revelation 10. Now church, you all know this. And I saw a mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the sun. Now in re Yeah, we'll read this here. And his feet as pillars of fire. Now keep your spot there. You got the bookmark? Keep your spot there. Go to Revelation 1:15 and 16. Just again, just to freshly uh review this. This is not just a regular angel. This is the mighty angel. This is the angel of the Lord. Revelation 1:15. And his feet like unto fine brass. Well, there's the brass on the feet. And if as if they burn in a furnace, and his voice was a sound of many waters, and he had his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp sword. And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. So this angel has the same attributes of Jesus. Face like the sun, feet like brass. Now go back to Revelation 10. And he had in his hand a little book open. And that was the book from Revelation 45 and 6 that wasn't open. But now the book's open. In other words, now the Bible mysteries can be revealed. Hallelujah. Amen. And he set his right foot up foot upon the sea and his left upon the earth. In other words, he has dominion over land and sea. Christ does. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth. And remember Amos 37 and8 says that when a prophet roars it's like a lion. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. Hallelujah. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven and things that are there are in, and the earth and the things that there are in, and the sea and and that are there and are, and the sea, and the things that which are therein, that there should be time no longer, but in the days of the seventh, I'm sorry, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he should begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared unto his servants, the prophets, Hallelujah. So here we get another picture of the angel of the Lord. God in an angel form comes down with an open book and gives the book to the seventh angel who's on earth. And then God declares the mysteries finished. Hallelujah. There's no more. All these seven seal mysteries have now been revealed to us. Church. &gt;&gt; Amen. And church remember it not only revealed what the antichrist was because right the first four writers are antichrist writers. It also revealed the anointings on the church. The four beasts. Praise God. So in this we have we have now Satan is unmasked. Think about that church. Before the seals the denominations they were just trying to fight like they're like beating the air, right? They had a blindfold. They don't they didn't even know that setting up their own denominations was antichrist. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, they weren't defeating the antichrist system. They would just go, brother Ang from one revival, Lutheran, Methodist, Isuza, uh, CMA, Assembly of God. They would just go from one denomination to the next. But God come down. Christ come down. He opened the seals. And now Satan's been exposed. And now it's like the church can put on her glasses or she can take off her blindfold. And now she can defeat the Antichrist spirit by the anointing of God on her. And now the Bible's a brand new Bible and now we understand real religion and we can have that old time religion. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise God. Brother said the Bible became a new Bible. Remember our preacher, brother Claude, the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. Remember I preached that last year? I don't know if you guys remember that, but I wanted to do a series on that, but I I took that quote from Brother Bram. The Bible became a new Bible. It's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. And now, brother Chris, now we see Jesus Christ talking to Abraham. Now we see him talking to Moses, Joshua. Hallelujah. Jacob, Paul, and now we see him giving the revelation to William Brandom. Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's why we can put William Brandom in our songs. We always sang about Noah on the wings of a snow white dove, right? We sang about Noah. We sang about David Sling, the battle belongs to the Lord. We can sing about all these men, but now we can sing about brother Brandham because he met the angel of the Lord as well. &gt;&gt; He said, he said he went out and seven angels met him and told him to go back. And then brother said, "The Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit met me every day to reveal the revelation of each seal." And when he got done, he preached, he said, "That's thus sayeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, 'If I ever preached anything inspired, it was those seven seals. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, see how the See how Jesus Christ is connected with brother Brandham? Because brother Brandham is restoring the covenant, the new covenant. What was the new covenant, church? The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. And brother comes back to restore it. It's not just speaking in tongues. It's not just shouting like I like to do. It's not dancing like some of us like to do. It's not just that. It's you having experience with God. God fills your soul. You'll have some of that. But you'll live the real Christian life. You'll live the same life they lived in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what it is. It's the full the full life of Jesus Christ that they had the day of Pentecost restored back to us. The alpha has become the omega. It's God's masterpiece. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I'm running out of voice. I gonna have much tomorrow for those little ones. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just address this here. I'm already at an hour and seven. I don't know how much you know, church, about other churches, but there's a lot of message churches that are way off the word of God. Some of them say that Revelation 10 is Jesus coming down and now the rapture's already started. Uh, and now God's not in heaven because Christ is on earth. That's wrong. Jesus came down to brother church. Jesus went back up. Does everybody catch that what I'm saying? Revelation 10, the mighty angel comes down, but the mighty angel went back up. &gt;&gt; But I'll say like this, the mighty angel's here in the form of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because he's always been here. Hallelujah. But you'd be surprised how many message people and even message preachers will say they'll say deity is not in heaven. Deity is on earth because of this scripture. Revelation 10. The church realize what they're saying. Can you picture? I think I mentioned this a few weeks ago. Can you imagine? They're saying when they pray, God's not even in heaven to hear it. God hears it down here on earth. That's what they're saying. God is not in heaven. Well, I have a question. If God's not in heaven, where is the blood of Jesus Christ to to forgive our sins? &gt;&gt; Right now, see, but see how this can be so tempting. I imagine uh some of our African saints, if they talk to saints, they probably talk to people that actually believe this. There's probably a lot of people in Africa that believe this, just like there are in Ohio, sadly sad to say. But they see the oh this angel of the Lord it's Jesus Christ come down to meet brother Ram every day for seven days and reveal the seals. He did but then the Lord Jesus Christ went back and but the Holy Ghost who's always been here is still here amongst us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And not only that but the angels of God are here as well. &gt;&gt; Now just to show you that let me read you three quotes in July 64 questions and answers. Brother Ram said to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist. For that person of the Lord Jesus Christ, listen, he says, is sitting at the right hand on the majesty on high. He didn't say he's here. &gt;&gt; He said he's sitting on the right hand of the majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory. &gt;&gt; Yet these message preachers won't look at that. They'll say, "Oh, he's here. He's here. He's here. He came down in Revelation 10. I'm sorry. You've just added your own false interpretation of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes, my God came down. Yes, the mighty angel came down in 1963. But the mighty angel went back up and now the mighty Holy Ghost is in the church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then there's people that say the spirit of Elijah. Now, we have the spirit of Elijah. Now, church, I don't believe that either because if we did, we'd be prophesying. And I know the Bible says prophesy again. But all that means is just repeating what's already been said. If that's the case, Brother Mang, then I I don't know anybody who's got the spirit of Elijah that actually prophesies on earth right now. That means that means nobody's got the Holy Ghost. It just struck me right there. Nobody's got the Holy Ghost then. Because who's saying thus sayith the Lord like brother Brandham? Nobody's saying it. Very few. Very few. Well, maybe there's a few. But that means there's only a few people got the Holy Ghost. So see that's wrong. I said that's wrong. They're trying to make themselves like Elijah and Elisha. They're taking that type way too far because if you had the spirit of Elijah, you'd be prophesying like brother Brandham, right? About California or about people uh uh having babies like Marilyn Hickey and all these things like that. Now, there might be some who have the prophetic gift, but but those preachers preach like everybody has the spirit of Elijah. I'm sorry, they don't. Hallelujah. So what they do is they misunderstand types. Yes, I know Elisha got the spirit of Elijah. I know that types Christ in the church. How many know that &gt;&gt; it types Christ in the church, but that doesn't mean every one of you are going to prophesy with thus sayith the Lord. It doesn't mean that brother Bang and I and the Sarongs and Canad we've been around long enough to know not everybody does that. Hallelujah. Amen. Just let me lay that in course in case you hear something crazy like that. Here's the next one. Uh four for five months before he died, brother Ram's having a a service preaching what is the attraction on the mountain. And that's where brother Ram said Revelation 10 1-7 is history. Let's say history. Ready? History. History. That means Revelation 10:1-7 has already been fulfilled. It was fulfilled in March of 63 when the Holy Ghost came down. Jesus came down to meet with brother Brandham and reveal the seven seals. Hallelujah. Brother Ram says it's history. This is the same sermon. Brother Ram is greeting all the people on tape that are listening to this sermon. He says, "Greetings to the West, San Jose, brother Borders. We send greetings to the mountains of a Prescott, Arizona, that's waiting for the coming of the Lord. We send greetings to Tucson waiting for the coming of the Lord. We send greetings to Houston, Texas, those waiting for the Are you getting it? Are you getting the the pattern here? Every city is waiting for what? Well, I thought he's here. They say he's here, Sister Naomi. They say he's already here and he's not coming. He's here. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, deceived friends. You haven't listened to enough tapes. Or if you did, you're listening, but you're not hearing what the spirit says to the church. &gt;&gt; Everybody see that? I'll keep going to a few more. He says, uh, now up in Chicago, those who are waiting for the up on the east coast, New York and Connecticut, the great groups up there waiting for the And then he says, here down in Clarksville, waiting for the And it says here at the Brandon Tabernacle, waiting for the &gt;&gt; You got that quote memorized. You didn't even know, did you? Five months before he died, he said, "Everybody is still waiting for the coming of the Lord." Why did Abraham say, "We're not waiting. He's already here." Because we got people that have evil spirits and preaching false doctrine, right? They can't rightly divide the word of truth, church. That means they shouldn't be teaching. Now, they can preach about raising people's faith. I've seen that some brothers can preach and raise the faith off the roof, but as soon as they start teaching, they break the word of God many times. Like that brother I told you, he can preach the house off and people get healed, miracles, all these things. They get the Holy Ghost, but he'll say things like deity. He said deity is not in heaven, deities on earth. That shows he's not much of a teacher. He doesn't have the gift to teach. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he also said this, brother B. He said, "We ought to believe uh every word from 47 to 65 just like we believe every word from Genesis to Revelation." That's complete heresy. That's complete idolatry. That man should not be trying to teach, but he's trying to. Shame on that man. He just lifted the tapes equal to the Bible. That's wickedness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Any man that's honest knows that. &gt;&gt; Now, that's my little uh injection there for people that listen that need that. By God's grace, our church probably got it pretty good by God's grace. Now, uh three weeks before he died, Brother Ram said this in modern events made clear by prophecy. We preach the coming of the Lord is at hand. Let's get to the fields down there and notify the heathen. See, do something about it. So three weeks before he's still waiting for the coming of the Lord. The coming of the Lord is not here. He says the coming of the Lord is at hand. &gt;&gt; So brother Chris, just so you know, some people take Revelation 10. They say, "Oh, the mighty angel's here. The angel Lord is here. So he's not in heaven." That that's a lie. The mighty angel came down just like Amen. just like all the other prophets. Amen. Moses and all them. And the then the mighty angel went back up to heaven. Now say like this. This is just a thought coming to me right now. Perhaps the mighty angel uh stayed with Moses his whole life just like Abraham. Maybe the mighty angel stayed with brother Brandham until you know brother passed away in 65. That's just coming to me now. All right. But let me find a place to close. I'm at an hour and 15. That's about perfect here. Uh by God's grace. Okay. Let's close with this. Now I want to bring it down to you a little more here. Let's take let's take take some encouraging scriptures here. I think this will encourage you by God's grace. Okay. Psalm 34:7. The angel Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and deliverth them. So the angels will camp near you. I heard a preacher say one time he he he saw a vision. I heard him say on a on a video he was watching and he saw the angel Lord come into the church and he was watching a brother just preach like this. He was just watching him real serious. And this was only a few years ago. And I believe the brother because I believe he's got the Holy Ghost. And so that gives us that gives a picture if the angels now think about that church. If that's true, then the angel's watching me like that too to make sure I say the right things. If I make a mistake, God will forgive me, right? But in other words, we're supposed to feel the presence of God that the angels are here. It's a holy atmosphere. God wants to bless his people. &gt;&gt; God wants to deliver his people. That's why the angel Lord is here. Hallelujah. I'm talking about your angel, your guardian angel. Now, church, let this encourage you. Psalm 91:11. Let this encourage you. For he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in what? All, let's say all thy ways. Ready? All th. The angel is going to keep you whether you drive out to Oregon or not, brother Vang. The angel Lord's going to keep you. Whether we drive up to Sandusky or not, the angel Lord is going to keep you all your ways. Right? So, this lets us know if anything happens to us that doesn't seem right, then God had to allow it. He's testing our faith just like he tested Job's. He's going to keep you in all your ways, brother Mercy. All your ways. Verse uh 12. Now, what are they gonna do if you fall? The Bible said, "They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone." So they kept uh brother Chris from breaking his ankle the other day. Right. Hallelujah. He got some ligament sprained, but the angel Lord was keep there to keep him from falling and breaking his bones. Now, here's the verse that Brother Am uses for the guardian angel. Matthew 18:10. Matthew 18:10, "Take heed that thy that ye despise not one of these little ones. For I say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven." Remember when m when Micaiah saw the vision of heaven, the Bible said he was surrounded by a host of angels on the right hand and on the left. And church, even these children got little an I'm sorry, even these little children got angels that are going to become down to them. Hallelujah. So the Bible says don't forget that you make sure you treat these little ones right because they've got a guarded angel. Hallelujah. And you don't want to get in trouble with God because God will rebuke you and God will correct you. He'll spank you harshly. Right? Whatever you need to bring you back to repentance. So this proves everybody here has got a guardian angel. Zion, you got a guardian angel. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Each one of us all the way to the youngest, the Genevieve and Zion. And I'm not sure if Andy's here or not, but they got from the oldest to the youngest, each one has an angel to keep you in all your ways. So that gives us also, church, an understanding. Don't fear about your life and your future because God's already got it planned out. &gt;&gt; He's already got an angel for all your steps to keep you in all your ways. And not only that, but he sent his angel before you to keep you. Hallelujah. Now, let me read these quotes from brother Brandham here. Uh, brother Brandham talks about the angel. He's talking. He says, "I pray you'll send the great angel of God who's fed me all the days of my life." Now, Malachi might think, "Well, my mom fed me all the days of my life." Brother Ram says, "The angels fed me all the days of my life and brought me through many dangerous toils and snares around the world." Now look, not only that, church. Now listen, and has bound Satan. Hallelujah. Praise God. So the angel made sure you were fed. It delivered you from toils and snares. And then it also kept Satan at bay. &gt;&gt; My what more could we ask for? Hallelujah. Then God sending his angel to keep Satan away and to provide all that you have need of, help you through every trial, every difficult situation. God's angel was there to keep you in everyone. Praise God for his angels. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brandon prays. I pray you'll send him tonight and let him be made manifest here on the platform as this little audience down here in this lovely place will believe on him with all their hearts. He says it again. I pray that you'll send your angel, the one who separated me from my mother's womb. Church, who brought you out of your mother's womb? The angel of the Lord. The angel made sure you came out. Hallelujah. Bringing me into this life and has ordained for this purpose will stand with me here tonight. So that tells me, brother Mercy, I'm standing here because the angel Lord separated me from my mother's womb and is standing by here making sure I'm preaching God's word to God's people. Hallelujah. And that's why I can do it night after night, year after year, right? Hallelujah. I'm coming into my second decade here. This June will be 20 years pastoring in Akran. Who made it possible? The angel of the Lord made it possible. He made it possible in your life as well. Abraham says for a third time, "And may the angel of God who's guided me through my life, not only protected you, but guided you as well." He guides you to the right job. He'll guide you to the right next job, too. How many believe that? And fed me since I was born. May he be here tonight to heal the sick and the afflicted. We ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Last one. The angel of God that you sent to me at my birth, guiding me down through life by your hand, who meets and talks and shows the visions that I speak of, Jesus, send him now in thy name, that he might be able to discern and know the gift, I'm sorry, and the gift of discernment to know the thoughts and intents of the heart. Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can come here, church, as we begin to pray. Does anyone here need deliverance? If you do, you should repent of your sins. The Bible says, so that way the angel Lord can bring deliverance to you. If you don't confess your sins, that devil has a legal right to stay in your life, your mind, your heart, whatever may, whatever you want to call it, your spirit. He's not in your soul. That's for sure. You're saved. He can't get into that soul. But that's what the Bible says. The angel Lord encamps about them that fear the Lord to deliver them. And church, if nobody here needs deliverance, well then he's here to give you a little victory because he's going to give you a little today. And church, if you listen on Wednesday, he'll give you a little victory on Wednesday. But don't forget Tuesday and Monday. &gt;&gt; Get some victory on Monday and Tuesday. The angel of the Lord. Let's put that verse on my mind here as we get ready to pray. He shall keep you in all your ways. Sister Beatatric, has he kept you in all your ways? Amen. Look at her. Raise your hand. How many believe he's kept you in all your ways? &gt;&gt; All your years. Some of you younger than others. Some of us older than others. He's kept me in all my ways. He's gone before me. He's prepared a place for me. Praise God. in this life. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we're thankful for today. Lord, bless your people, Lord. I hope this was an encouragement to them, Lord God. Lord, you separated us from our mother's womb. You've fed us all the days of our lives. Dear God, you set your angel to provide our mothers, our fathers these jobs, allowed us to have money and get food. You fed us all the days of our life. Hallelujah. Not only that, Lord, you've led us. You've guided us in every decision. I didn't know anything about Akran. You guided me here, Lord God. You prepared a place for me. Lord, each one of us, I want, Lord, each one of us, God, now I pray that we'd look at our lives, look at the times you delivered us to remind us that you're always there. We have supernatural help available. You have bore us up that we don't dash our foot against the stone. Hallelujah. You've guided us in all of our ways, Lord God. We want to thank you for today, Lord Jesus. Lord, I just want to take a moment, Lord, and with the church. And Lord, we just want to thank you for your angels. So, church, would you do that? Would you raise your hands or would you just bow your head and just thank the Lord that you have an angel there that's guided you and protected you? Just take that for a few moments. Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord. Thank you that an angel separated me from my mother's womb. Lord, sent me to Akran, Lord God, has provided me this place, Lord, for a home, not only that, but a spiritual home. Thank you, Lord God. You protected me on all my ways and all my car driving. Lord God, you protected me on Wednesday, a couple Wednesdays ago, when the car was swerving right at me. Lord God, you spared my life. God, thank you. You're kind. You're gracious and merciful. Lord God, thank you. The angels of God are here. Lord God, the ministering spirits are here, Lord God. I could say in the last two weeks, I've been delivered by the angel of the Lord. I should have got hit, but you gave me the alertness to honk on my my horn, and you give alertness to that individual to swerve his car right at the last moment. Thank you God for your angels. Hallelujah Lord God. Oh glory to God. Lord may this teach us to fear you more Lord as we look at the angel of the Lord. Lord you sent yourself Lord down in the angelic body with these covenants, these promises to your people. Lord, thank you for meeting with Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua. Hallelujah. David, Lord, you gave him a covenant, Lord God. Thank you, Lord, for meeting with John the Baptist, Lord God. Hallelujah. And thank you, Lord God, for meeting with your prophet, Brother Brandham, Lord God. Thank you for meeting with St. Paul to give us this New Testament, Lord, which we will be judged by the angels here to make sure we obey this word, oh God. May we obey your voice, hearken under your voice, Lord God, do that which is pleasing in thy sight, Lord God. Lord, as we pray here, Lord, again, we thank you, Lord God, for the angels of God. Thank you for your protection, Lord. If anyone needs deliverance, I pray they'd seek it, Lord, with all their hearts today, Lord God. I pray, God, you'd forgive every sin, Lord. Look past our faults and see our needs today, Lord, by the blood of Jesus Christ, Lord. May each person feel delivered and feel that they've gone a little further, Lord, in their journey, Lord, in the promised land. We ask it. We give you thanks and praise in Jesus Christ's name. And the church said,
