all things well amen he's opened up the storehouse of heaven for us he's met all of our needs he's done nothing but being kind to us hey man I'll never always be thankful I'll always be thankful for the things that he has done for us amen amen I just I've seen what he's done in my life and I have a testimony of good things he's taking me from where I was I may be something I could have never made myself amen and I just that I always worship Him praise His Holy Name Amen amen this morning I just wanted to preach a message called the return to righteousness amen and uh as we to get into the message let's open our Bibles to the book of Ezra thank the musicians you guys did folks did a wonderful job I just I appreciate the atmosphere what a beautiful atmosphere amen amen Ezra chapter one will read the first through the fourth verses there and then from there we'll go to the book of Haggai chapter one the return to righteousness one thing is there's always an opportunity if you somehow leave righteousness off to the side that God in His mercy and grace gives us an opportunity to go back I'm glad that he does that amen and so just a little background here as we're chapter 1 is the ending of the Babylonian captivity seventy years they spent in Babylon with all their traditions all of their everything that the Jews held dear was centered around Mount Zion was centered around Jerusalem so when they lost Jerusalem they lost the whole heart of their religion and they really struggled in Babylon how to perform their religion without the City of God Amen so so ezra and ezra chapter 1 they're getting a glimpse an opportunity a chance to go back to righteousness like to go back to where they came from amen and so let's let's just read here ezra chapter 1 verse 1 through 4 and it says now in the first year of sirius the king of persia that the word of the lord might be by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of sirius king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all of his kingdom and he put it also in writing saying thus saith sirius the king of persia the Lord goddess Jehovah God every time you see those capital lor D in the King James s Jehovah the Jehovah God of heaven have given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people his God be with him let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of Jehovah God in Israel he is the God which is in Jerusalem and whosoever remaineth in any place where he is soldiers let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts besides the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem and then rose up the chief of the fathers of bow Judah and Benjamin and all the priests and the Levites and all them whose spirit God has had raised to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem this is an exciting time I I just I don't know if you can place yourself in their shoes not only they're getting permission to go back to leave their captivity but they're getting the proclamation of those that held them captive go back I will help you I will send you the documents I will send you the commandments I will send you letters and now I will send you gold I will send you silver whatsoever things you have need of your God has stirred up my spirit and commanded me to send you back to rebuild his house what could happen in these next few years I mean just the excitement and and what we're going to do here is we're gonna fast forward in time 16 years and turn over to the book of Haggai let's look at their progress in 16 years down the road and look it and see what's going on we'll go to Haggai chapter 1 verse 11 there's a landmark event that happens just 16 years after this after this after this statement hey guys the third - the last book there in the Old Testament and we're gonna read just we're gonna read Haggai chapter 1 verse 11 but we're only going to read the first six words of the verse and it says and I called for a drought now this is an amazing statement let's just go ahead and we're just gonna stop right there let's pray and then we'll get on into the message Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for your gospel your words your scriptures they are rich each verse lures a thousand miles deep Laura and I pray that somehow this morning Lord that you would just allow us to to enter into eternity Lord and and lose a sense of time father and and not to where all the people but Lord just to dive into your gospel to your scripture and find out those things Lord that you've laid before us and Laura we just are looking to you father and I pray you to bless us right now with a revelation of your scripture in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated and I called for a drought sixteen years after a God Jehovah had stirred up the king of Persia to send them back to the land where all the blessings lie they get back there and they've been given all the gold all the silver everything they have need up to rebuild the house of the Lord and here comes this scripture right here and it says and they're there they're back in their homeland and here comes a prophet by the name of Haggai marching into Jerusalem with a message for the people for the people that are going back to righteousness here is a message I have for you from the same God the same Jehovah that that brought you back here the same God now has a message for you and he says I am calling for a drought now this is a powerful now you know at my workplace I times I have one of my duties that I do is I have to draft communications that go out to all of our employees a MEF we have a certain project going on in this building over here or this building over there then then we have to send out an announcement you know what to explain you know this is what's going to happen this is when it's going to happen this is the impact that's going to be to your work teams and all those things and and then and then drafting these letters I've I've learned that one thing you really have to do when you're drafting these letters is you have to answer some key questions I'm sure you're familiar with the who the why who why what where when how any proper communication needs to answer those key questions if you're gonna if you want to get something across to the people you need to answer the who the what the why the where the wind and the how amen and if you're a communication answers those key those key questions then then you can be assured that your message is getting across you know you you've answered the question you haven't left anything out you you've made a false statement a mess or whatever I'm drafting a communication I'm always kind of mentally going down the check Cliff's making sure that I've answered every little all those little points there and those questions amen so as we as I look at this thing here and I called for a drought if we were just to mention just that scripture by itself we wouldn't have any contexts to place it you know we're first thing we have to consider here is who is calling for a drought you know what what what who is this person that is calling for a drought let's turn over to Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 2 the Jeremiah chapter 2 has written just some hundred years before hey guy Jeremiah to chapter or chapter 2 verse 13 and it says for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living water and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water so this God that is sending His Prophet Haggai to announce the coming of a drought is the very fountain of living waters the fountain of living waters Himself is the one that's calling for this drought that's a lot of context the very god that provides the water from heavens is the one that's calling for a drought that's powerful you know I just kind of want it let's let's just I want to I want to just kind of show you an example this let's go back to this who what why where when how every time you get to a place in scripture you have to also if you want to put it in context you have trance for those questions yourself Amen when you get into a question you have to answer well who is that's written to you after you want to get these things in the right context Amen let's let's just take an example that if you if you just give me a space of time this morning I I don't want to rush this so let's just take a time let's go over to Ephesians chapter 1 I kinda wanna just show you how we apply that into the scriptures when you consider the who why what where when how and you the one of the landmark areas of scriptures to play set it is in Ephesians chapter one Jesus chapter one verse three and four it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be wholly without blame before him and love amen it just keeps going on there but just to go back to verse three there who are we talking about here it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ he is the eternal everlasting God amen he is the he is the creator of the heavens and the earth a man whenever we talk about the who here we have to keep in mind who we're talking about here you know it's like when people talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit sometimes we we talk about so flippantly that sometimes I wonder if we forget who we're talking about when we're talking about being filled with the Holy Ghost amen because we were talking about being filled with the Holy Ghost it's it's you know we give these little descriptions of the Holy Spirit of you like boy spear is like a dove or or the Holy Spirit is oil or so much those things but the Holy Spirit really is not enough the loi spirit is not oil those are just types of him amen but the Holy Spirit is the same one there brooded over a dark earth back in the beginning a man the Holy Spirit is the same one that they uttered out let there be light amen he is the eternal everlasting God amen so if anybody ever once describes to you from behind a pulpit talking about the end dwelling the fulfilling of the Holy Ghost he is talking about something that is so powerful he's talking about the very presence Amen of the creator himself now coming and living in dwell you Amen so whenever we try to answer the who question in the Gospels and we're trying to figure out God we have to catch that revelation of who this God is a man let him be fully revealed to you that this God is the almighty powerful God amen he is the one the infant I just preached back at home about the the infinite resources amen how God will the infinite God create a world with finite resources God the God that had no boundaries created a world with boundaries amen the god of infinite resources create a world has finite resources amen so when he put his people upon the earth he gave them laws to live inside of amen and they had to live according to the laws of physics and of gravity and and all these things but in the myths of time God placed an infinite resource in the midst of the earth and that was the Lord Jesus Christ where Jesus said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me amen and I give unto you power to be the sons and daughters of God in the myths of this finite creation God placed an infinite resource which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and you can draw all things from him amen so the Christians are not bound by the finite resources because we have the ability as sons and daughters of God even though we're living in this finite world amen to tap back into that infinite resource and draw all things amen a man soul there when we're talking about the who that's the who that we're talking of he is the God of the infinite resources so when going back to Ephesians 1:3 there blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ what has he done he has blessed us oh my now I don't want to just rush over this he the infinite God the infinite resource has now not just held those things to himself but he has reached into the treasure house of heaven and he has blessed us with heavenly blessings amen he has blessed us with with all spiritual blessings well that's pretty power there's you can there's not too many things that aren't in that scripture he is blessed us with all spiritual blessings so let me tell you if you're missing out on something ask a man as we were talking yesterday if you're missing out on something cry out to him let your cry each are up to the throne of God and as your cry is growing up the the Holy Spirit will join himself up with your prayer and bind himself to your prayer and hijack your prayer and make your prayer go right to where the will of God and he'll make intercession for you according to the will of God amen amen and then and then what when God looks upon you and your cry he looks back at this scripture right here he says oh I have blessed them with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus amen amen who and the what amen Court is he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're in heavenly places in Christ amen as he has chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world MA he's got it all laid it out he's answering every question he's checking off every box right here he's given us a full communication a man he's fully describing who we are what we've come to do what is available to us amen when he did it a man he didn't just do it have high release in the midst of time a man but he did it back before the foundation of the world amen who why where it went amen why that why did he do all this a way through verse four why did he do all this so that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen let me tell you when God sets his mind to something it's going to come to pass Amen so if he has set his mind upon you if your heart has been warmed if you have ever once felt the presence of the Lord of your door if he's ever come knocking on your hearts door this is his intention right here he has written the communication he has answered every question in these two verses he has laid out the entire plan of salvation not just for every much for you and he has answered every question these things are for you a man blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ because he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Aquarius he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so that we would be holy and without blame before him in love that means it's possible Saints every time you read a scripture like this there are be something in your heart that raises up and says yes Lord I accept that that's mine I will cannot only claim it but I'm gonna live it I'm gonna walk it I'm gonna be it I'm gonna become it why because God gave me permission to become this when God sent out the communication from heaven down to earth he sent it out by a prophet a man by saint paul and he sent it to you that you might hold on to it and claim it because everybody that receives a prophet amen well it also should grant when they grab ahold of a message amen they have the argument of supernatural ability to become that message a man I want to us if we don't become that message amen any pre any people that receive a message have a responsibility to become that message amen and woe unto them because they've been given all opportunities to become that that that message he hasn't held anything back from you even his own Holy Spirit amen he has not held back anything from you even to the point of giving you the Holy Ghost which makes all things possible to them that belief amen hey man so let's let's just go back to Haggai chapter 11 year now we've kind of gone through there that there let's go back to Haggai chapter 1 there I called for a drought these are the people that just sixteen years before this where someone stood up on a little desk and unrolled a scroll before them and it was a proclamation by the king of Syria of Persia serious and as they made the announcement let's all gather together we have something we need to read we have a message that's been given to us and as he unscrew London unwraps the scroll of the proclamation of serous and is the words of seriousness as uttered over the desk a man is an Alpha is Ezra I don't recall who wrote it out but but but but as he read the proclamation they had to get a little bit excited a mint they had to get a little bit excited that they're all my here the king the one that has kept us in bondage the one that used to keep us in in Chains the one that used to keep us here in Babylon the one who used to who had the the rule and the authority over over Jerusalem and was keeping Jerusalem down is now saying I am taking my hand off Jerusalem I am taking my hand off Jerusalem by the commandment of Jehovah and I am giving to the rule of Jerusalem back over to the piss God's own people the Jews and not only that by I'm commanding you to go back to Jerusalem and build Jehovah a house and I am going to give you letters so that you can prove to anybody may I ask you what are you doing who gave you authority let it be known that God in heaven has given Cirus you said back there's and Ezra chapter 1 that the God in heaven has given all the world into my control the world it belongs to me said Cirrus God has given to my control and now I am giving drew ruslan back to you amen and I'm sending you letters to prove it and I am also sending you letters commanding anybody in any city wherever you live to help you with gold and with silver whatever you have need of but just go back and build a house for jehovah you know i tell you when you get when you have something like that how can you fail I just we're just boggles the mind how could they fail how could they not how could they stop how could anything go so let's let's turn here and hey guys sorry I keep making you bounce back for Plus let's go ahead and read sixteen years after that Scrolls read they come to Haggai chapter 1 verse 2 and it says thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this people say well who are these people it's the Jews this people say the time has not come the time that the Lord's house should be built I read that you just think what happened here 16 years ago they were reading with excitement the letter of from serous saying go back and build the house and now the people are saying Jehovah is sending their prophet and said you are saying within yourself the time has not come to build the house of Lord how did this happen I the idea you're thinking your mind how did this happen it's so easy to look back into history and look at the people I think what happened how did this come let's keep reading verse three then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying is it time for you to dwell in your own seal that's trimmed out your own trimmed out houses and this house that's God's house this house lies waste now therefore thus saith Lord of hosts consider your ways you've sewn much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you clothed you but there is none that is warm and he the earth wages earth wages to put it into a bag with holes thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways go up into the mountain and bring wood build the house and I'll take pleasure and I will be glorified saith Lord you look for much and Loic aim too little and when you brought a home I did blow on it why saith Lord because my house that is waste then come down to verse 10 it says therefore the heaven over you estate with new the earth has stayed from her fruit and I called for a drought God Jehovah God the fountain of living waters who rules over Jerusalem for all of eternity has claimed Jerusalem to be his own land has blessed with all spiritual blessings amen has now calling for a drought upon the lake it's just a powerful statement I just said my mind just always keeps going over God when you think about the who what why where when how when you get catched her who the whole revelation of who is saying this he's calling for a drought now let's go back in history a little bit and just kind of go through what rain really meant to Israel because if God is in a call for a drought you know what's gonna happen the rain is gonna cease the land is gonna dry up the crops are gonna fail amen you know you just know when he calls for a drought those are there's gonna in the process of time things are gonna be gate begin to get a little dry the the corn that produces this year was not going to produce as much next year and things it's gonna be I can't just go down to Walmart it's gonna get a little rough it's gonna get a little tough amen let's let's turn over to I hope I wrote it down here it's in Deuteronomy I think I'm gonna have to turn there by faith I'm not seen in my notes oh there it is Deuteronomy chapter 11 so in Deuteronomy chapter 11 this is when the children of Israel are going back to the promised land that God had promised them and he gave them certain commandments certain things certain expectations amen have how to live in that land and that's what Deuteronomy really was is is God was giving them the commandments I'm taking you to the promised land but this is how I want you to live in this land are there certain specific ways I don't want you to live in my promised land any old way but I want you to live in the land a very specific way I want you have certain attitudes certain expectations certain beliefs certain ceremonies certain certain certain religious ceremonies and such a man and feasts and everything amen amen this is how I want you to live in my promised land so you get to Gerar me chapter 11 let's read verse 10 and it says for the land whether thou goest in to possess it is not like the land of Egypt from where you came out of where thou sawest thy seed and water sit with thy foot as a garden of herbs but the land where you go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh the water of the rain of heaven now I want to go back that wherein in verse 10 that where says where a wallet were you water with your foot what that speaking of is is in Egypt they had the Nile River there and they could create irrigation channels and they would draw little channels with their foot amen and then the the water would go along these irrigation canals and then wherever they create a little row with their foot amen the water would run along that stream and their crops would constantly buy their own work by their own labor by creating these channels their crops would always have water amen and that's how they water their crops along the Nile River amen but but God is telling them now I don't want you to live like you live back in Egypt because the Land of Israel isn't like the land of Egypt amen because when you go over to lay it to the promised land to the Land of Israel you're gonna your crops are gonna grow a little bit differently you're they're not gonna grow by your own labor or your own work you're not gonna water them with your own foot but your crops are gonna drink the water from heaven your crops are gonna be reliant on Jehovah if you're gonna grow crops it's not going to be by your own work and your own labor but it's gonna be by the rain from heaven by Jehovah amen so in Egypt they water their crops by their own Labor's amen when they are in the wilderness God gave them water or gave them food and water supernaturally by by raining down manna from heaven or by opening water out of the rock he gave them their sustenance supernaturally but a quantity comes to the promised land he says oh there's a process to this I the Lord will send down the rain you will plant the seeds I will give the increase and together we will have a partnership together as our fingers laced together we'll be in partnership and unity together Jehovah and his people to bring crops for the living of the people Amen it's not like Egypt where they did it was their own work Amen it's not those lists not their labor it's not just God alone sending down manna from heaven but now it's the people and God together amen they had to trust in the Lord to send the rain they had to trust in the Lord to send the rain hey man let's go down to verse 12 the next verse there he's describing land he says and the land which the LORD thy God careth for describing the promised land for the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it wouldn't you like the God have his always always upon you amen he does from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year because remember the beginning of the year was the beginning of their crops amen the end of the year would be when the crops come in from the harvest and God's eyes were on the crops from the beginning to the end and he knew how much rain they needed so he had Scott would send the rain in their own due seasons and God says don't you worry you live according to my laws and I will send my reign in his due seasons amen and verse 14 and that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou may us together in thy corn and thy wine and nine oil amen because each particular crop needed a particular amount of rain amen some crops needed this much some cross need that much some crops grow at this time of the year some this time of the year and each crop had its own season a time of the year and God alone knew how much rain to send it and so he say this is not like the land of Egypt where you do your irrigation channels but this is the land where the rain is provided by the God of heaven it is due season amen so when when you get to the book of Haggai where he says I am calling for a drought he says I am interrupting my promise to you I am I'm calling for a stop the Ray is gonna cease the crops are gonna dry out the blessings are gonna be over why because something has happened in the minds of the people to where they have gone back on their end of the bargain amen they are stay have declared to themselves that they're no longer in partnership with Jehovah amen because the the agricultural of Israel a cultural life of Israel was to be a partnership between God and His people amen God would send the rains the people would Widow would plant the seeds God would bring the increase and then at the end of the cycle he'd send the latter rain and then they grow up and bring the harvest and then they would offer the harvest back to the Lord they gave it and so all throughout the entire year the whole agricultural cycle of Israel was a partnership between God's people in himself had to be in partnership God couldn't be left out of the mix and neither could the people be left out of the mix they had to be united together they had to trust in the Lord for the rain and he had to trust in them to plant the seeds amen so in the book of Haggai got when God called for a drought he did it for a very specific reason amen now we're going to keep going let's go down to verse 16 he says how he's given them a warning and this warning is linked to their crops amen take heed to yourself be careful lay your heart be not deceived what does this have to do with crops they have to keep their into the bargain amen God wants them to act a specific way in his promised land amen take heed to yourself that your heart be not deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you and he sharp the heaven and there be no rain and the land yield not her fruit lest he perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord give you know once you consider what happens if the crops fail in Israel they can't just go over to Walmart or to some other store somewhere else if the crops fail they perish a man if the crops failed a day I remember how many times throughout the Old Testament where they would start eating their children and do different things why because I drought would come the crops would fail like the one when we toll I should I'm gonna make this my last meal we rub two sticks together we're gonna make this meal and then we're gonna my son I are gonna die because they had left off there into the bargain amen they were ignoring Jehovah they are to be in partnership together but one-half the partnership drifted away drifted away amen and so what the rains quit falling from heaven because of the drifting away it's powerful it's powerful you know and I think about how it's so easy for us to look back into history I think 16 years from Ezra - hey guy they had everything that they needed everything was provided Cirrus gave him all the gold and the silver he gave them permission he gave them the rule of the land just go back to Jerusalem and bill got a house go back to Jerusalem build jehovah house and worship him there what a commandment but when they got there and hey guy says that they went back there and they built their own houses it says Noah did they build their own houses it says they trimmed them out and they finished them while his own house was still laying in ruins the walls were still broken down from when Jeremiah went into captivity all the fire and the flames when they burned down the city they're still there when they had taken up all the stones in there that was still there yeah where they had everything they've been ruined and desecrated was still ruined and desecrated everything was still destroyed and yet they had built their own houses they were leaving off their end of the bargain they went back there and they were enjoying the crops they're enjoying their houses they're there they're enjoying the good fruit of the land but the partnership never returned they are supposed to their fingers was supposed to be interlaced with Jehova's fingers a man supposed to be God and man worshiping one another loving loving God amen and giving hands falling into his Commandments but they didn't go uphold their end of the bargain and God would not let his people live in such a condition let me tell you that that drought may seem kind of cruel but in actuality it was actually God's mercy amen because is God's mercy to draw them back into partnership with him because he God's people have to live with him and United with him they are his people he chose them amen amen if you're gonna live in God's promised land you have to live by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you have to live in the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen yes now I just from this point let's let's let's go on to the New Testament here as I said about a lot of of Israel because they had such a partnership with Jehovah a lot of their feasts had to do with agriculture you know I was like the way their it wave the wave sheaf you know is the harvesting of the wheat you know the day of Pentecost and and all those things they all had to do with specific crops you know and I know you've probably heard many service preached on them and I'm not gonna dive into them too much but but there is one particular feast that they had the Feast of Tabernacles amen where they would leave they walk out of their houses and they build little booths and they'd live in booths because they are celebrating the time back when they lived in the wilderness say men but the another part of the feast is who was when they celebrated that all of the crops have been brought in amen all of the crops have been brought in we've made it through another year we have all of our wheat we have all of our barley we have all of our grapes our cows are thick and fat a man they've had enough to eat a grass to eat in the fields and Jehovah has rained down his blessings upon us amen and he has provided all of our fruits amen he gave us all but the rain Whitney needed in our due season and we're gonna gather all of our crusts together in one place a man we're gonna worship the Lord God Jehovah and the Feast of Tabernacles and we're gonna praise Him at the end of the year for all of his blessings that he has rained down upon us and all that he has given us and they said that the the Feast of Tabernacles was a feasts of great joy and great great blessings in Jerusalem amen amen when it said that one or that one of their Jewish rabbis said that you have never known true joy and tell you a celebrate in the Feast of Tabernacles you have never known true joy and tell you a celebrate in the midst of the Feast of Tabernacles why because they were they were at the end God had fulfilled his into the bargain it's not just that they had done their end of the bargain but they had planted their seats and God had responded and he sit down the ring Amen God had Sid responded and he poured out the rain and showers of blessings upon them and their fruits and the seeds that they planned responded and gave the increase and he came up and worshiped the Lord God Jehovah and they were able to reap all their crops and here they have the fruits of their crops the evidence of God's blessings are all piled up in the in the barns and the Garner's amen and now they're gonna gather together in a feast and praise the Lord God Jehovah of heaven for rain ah his blessings upon them and the rabbi said that no one has ever experienced true joy until they have first experienced the Feast of Tabernacles praise God reminds me of Pentecost the Pentecostal blessings amen where God sends down the Holy Spirit upon the earth amen amen so let's her to John chapter 7 Joe in John chapter 7 was coming about to the time of the Feast of Tabernacles and Jesus towards the end of Jesus's ministry there John 7 verse 2 it says now the Jews Feast of Tabernacles was at hand all these thousands of years hundreds and hundreds of years the Jews have been celebrating this Feast of Tabernacles all the every year God's been providing them with their crop providing them with their crop providing them with blessings providing with showers rain in their due seasons and hundreds and hundreds of years every year they celebrated once more God has blessed us once more God has provided once more and here Jesus's is in the Land of Israel and it's coming upon that season where they're going to they're going to celebrate once more that God has provided for all of our needs like we read there in Ephesians God has given us everything he's given us all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus everything that we have need of and now they're getting to in the natural celebrate that God has given us everything that we have need of and we have the fruits of it laying right here we are sir harvest has been successful praise God Almighty we've reaped once more amen and so as the now that feast of tabernacles you know I was a it was an eight to seven or an eight day feast there and each day of the feast the the the the priests would well first off one thing they would do is in the evening they had these four columns in the courtyard they had golden bowls on the top and these golden bowls they would fill them with oil these were tall pillars and these Bulls were wait wait wait wait at the top and they would climb these ladders with these Bulls oil and they'd fill with oil and they'd light them on fire and these four pillars will be flaming with fire and they say it would lighten all of Jerusalem would every courtyard Jerusalem will be shining with the light from the tablet from the hill from Mount Zion amen and then another thing that they were doing this feast is every day of the feast they would go down and and they would go today get these jugs empty jugs for holding water amen and the priest would go marching dancing holding these jugs and they'd be dancing down the hill and they go down they leave the tabernacle they would leave the temple and they'd go down to the base of Mount Zion and at the base of Mount Zion there was this little spring there a man in this little spring if they had had good rain throughout the year this spring would always be bubbling up bubbling up this spring didn't come up from the from the deep of the earth but this spring as she came from the volume of water that Mount Zion would hold a man because as God rained down from heaven the water would soak into Mount Zion a man though and the mountain would hold the water and it would come out and he would pressurize at the bottom of the mountain and it would spring out this little crevice of the rock into a little spring Amen so the priest would march down Mount Zion and they'd be holding these jokes and they'd grit and they'd fill up these jugs with the water and if there had been enough rain for the crops there'd also be enough rain for the spring to spring out his water amen amen so they go down there and they fill these these jugs with water and they marched back up and sing the Psalms of David as they marched and so they are singing there's these particular Psalms that they were seeing called the halo his songs I think 113 to 118 and they would sing these songs as they is marching back up the hill holding these jugs of water a man they get up and they pour them out in the courtyard by the altar there a man there because God had provided rain for the year amen God had answered his into the bargain amen God had provided them with all of their needs they men and and once a day they would pour it out one time but on the last day of the feast on the last day of the feast they would do it seven times amen and so now Jesus had told his brethren going up to the feast I'm not going go on up before me but then he went around he did go on a little bit later in secret amen and so I'm not going up right now so you go on ahead but then later he went up secretly amen and so when he get down to verse 37 there here it is in the last day of the feast and Jesus stands up let's just read that there and in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried oh we're just gonna stop right there Jesus was watching them perform these ceremonies amen brother Jesse would you mind going and getting my large cellphone off the table in there as Jesus watched this every day who watched the the priests marching up the hill a man as they marched up the hill they would be dancing and singing and they would be holding their water pucks water pots and it still is supposed to be a feast of exceeding exceeding great joy and I just want to read this quote by this Jewish rabbi here it says here whoever has not seen they called this South the ceremony the celebration of the water libation it says whoever has not seen the celebration of the water libation has never experienced the feeling of true joy and then he said as the people saying the righteous and pious men would dance before them while juggling flaming torches and and then the Levite saying keeps going on and they would go up and they'd be carrying these water jugs and then they'd pour them out amen and they'd go down to the spring and they'd pour him out amen and then they'd pour the water out at the altar amen and then and then what one thing they would do as they are doing is they would as they would they was seeing the halo which is Psalms 113 through 118 let's just turn there real quick I'm not going to read all through all these all all the Psalms they're all six Psalms but let's just read a little bit of the last there because Jesus was watching them do this as they're marching back up the hill with the water they're singing they're dancing there's great joy everywhere and they're singing the songs of David and they get to Psalms 118 and they begin to sing verse 19 it says open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will praise the Lord they gave this gate of righteousness into which the righteous shall enter think about they're carrying their jugs and they're going through each gate the gate of the courtyard they gate into this and the gate and they going through these various gates amen and they're singing this and it says I will praise thee for thou has heard me and now our become my salvation there's Jesus just watching them amen and then the sinisa and they're singing the stone which the builders refused has become the head of the corner it has become the headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord has made we will rejoice and be glad Oh save now I beseech thee O Lord O Lord I beseech thee sin now thy prosperity blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord Amen hair stands Jesus he is that he is the head scorn he was the one that was rejected he's watching them perform this ceremony and that's when all of a sudden Jesus stands up he couldn't take it anymore amen this was to be the last feast of tabernacles in the natural amen one of the last feast of tabernacles in the natural why because the answer of all those hundreds of years of celebrations now the infinite resource was standing in their midst the one that provided all that water in his due season was standing right there the one that had provided all their crops was right there the one that they are celebrating was standing right there amen he was the cap so the the corn stone that was rejected he's standing there watching them he's the one that provided the water that they were carrying amen and they're rejoicing in it and he stands up an adverse alert john 7:37 there he says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water he was the everlasting resource now it is time I will give you exactly way seven ephesians i have blessed you with all spiritual blessings in christ jesus i have now become the everlasting resource a man i think about you know how christ gave us his forgiveness we had a lot of debts stacked up against us amen and you know throughout all the hundreds of years all these debts have been stacked up against us i think about like the the dead of murder when a and commits murder he takes something that he can no longer ever restore amen he took someone else's life but he can't give that life back he cannot restore it so therefore he is guilty of murder and all men look at him and say you had no right to commit murder you had no right to do that because you took something you could not restore and all men judged like that you know and when you do something like right now if I used to go down to France over to the museum to the Loire where they store the Mona Lisa if I was to go there and I was to destroy the Mona Lisa all the world would judge me they would say you had no right to do that you are guilty that didn't belong to you all the world will look at me and judge me you destroyed something and you say we'll all repaint it I could never restore that it would never be the same it's like that Cathedral that burned down recently the Notre Dame a hundred-year-old Cathedral with all those 800 year old Timbers of wood they say oh we're going to rebuild that they can't rebuild it they can make another structure that will look like it they can put in new but it's not the same it'll never be the same again because something was destroyed a hundred you can't go get a hundred pieces old what the people they carve that are dead and gone it cannot be rebuilt like it was it cannot be restored so debt was created upon the earth that cannot be repaid because this world is a world of finite resources amen and God created this world of finite resources and because he did that when people take things that they cannot restore it creates a debt upon the earth it creates a debt upon the earth and that debt is stacked against those that did the act they may think of an abuse victim when someone abuses someone and that person lives their entire life but it troubled in their mind because of how they were abused well there's a debt there because something was taken that should have never been taken something what happened to that person that never should have happened and is a debt stacked against that abuser how can that debt ever be repaid because if he repents well the act the the effect is still over here upon the other person how can that debt be repaid there is a debt that cannot how can I ever be restored a debt has been created how can it ever be repaid a man beg God in the midst of tri time placed the Lord Jesus Christ and in this world of finite resources the Lord Jesus Christ is that infinite resource he is the one that can pay every debt he can restore everything that was ever wronged he could rebuild notre-dame if he wanted to he could bring it speak it right back into existence amen he could undo every single thing he is the infinite resource and the earth hey I remember Jesus sit up and cried in the Tabernacle once he the scrolls hand tome Isaiah 60 amen 61 and he opened up the scroll and he found where as Rennie says this Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor to bind up the brokenhearted to say liberty them that are bruised amen to to to is to say Liberty though they're in captivity to heal them to bind up the brokenhearted the Spirit of Lord God is upon me and that same spirit is the water that we're talking about that anointing that was upon him in Isaiah 61 and Luke 4 that anointing that was upon him is the water that we're speaking of they they when Jesus Christ was standing there watching that water libation saraburi he's watching them rejoicing and singing and shouting and dancing and he's standing there was an announcement in his mind to give out the announcement you don't just have to rejoice over that but I am giving unto you the everlasting resource all forgiven it all sins can be forgiven everything can be restored the abuses can be made right they're murderers can be healed life can be restored back to those that were saying from your mind is in trauma can be restored whatever has been done to you it can be reversed I am coming with healing with deliverance I am the everlasting resource I am the spring at the bottom of the hill and if you come unto me out of your blow out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water I am that resource I am though I am the water that you are celebrating and not just that but if any man thirst let him come unto me let him come unto me and then you will become that everlasting resource you will be that tree that is planted by the waters you will be that tree those planted by the fountain of living waters amen and yours and a drought will can never affect you why because you're sealed unto the Lord Jesus Christ amen jesus said there in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried If any man thirst let him allowing to come unto me and when he comes unto me he opens up his mouth and he takes a drink of that everlasting water amen and if he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water the verse 39 says but this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified but let me tell you surely Jesus has now been glorified and let me tell you I am glorifying right now the Lord Jesus Christ in your sight right now this morning and the songs that we sung we are all glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ and he said wherever two or three are gathered I'll be right there in the midst of them and when I come in the midst of you I'll be the same yesterday today and forever amen and when I come the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to bind up the brokenhearted to preach the gospel to the poor the Senate liberties of the blind to heal to restore the sight to those that are blind amen to let set at liberty those there in captivity and he's here right now this morning to give that to you so come unto Him and drink so I have your bellies shall flow rivers of last night I spoke about that about the dedication of ceremony of Solomon I probably speak that almost every time I come here but when Solomon dedicated that temple he said O Lord we have built this house for the God of heaven but how can we build you a house they say the Lord but you take joy in this house but you enjoy this place and if you and I ask Lord that you have set a process a law in this house that if any man come into this house and have respect unto the name of Jehovah if any of the Jews coming to this house and respect unto the name of Jehovah and lay there cry lay their prayer upon the altar that you'll or would hear from heaven and answer their prayer and he said furthermore Lord I pray that if a stranger from Israel comes and if even if a stranger comes and comes into this house they if he if he has respects under the name of Jehovah and lays this prayer here upon the altar I pray Lord that you also would hear even his prayer from heaven an answer him and you don't let's that was still in effect today because you have become the temple the Most High God Amen you have become the spring of living water you have become the repository of the everlasting resource the anointing the spirit of living God the one that can make all things right the one that can restore I will restore this is less saith Lord Amen all the years that the enemies eating but he will do it through you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so when we talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not talking about just an emotion we're not talking about just a doctrine a man as young as the Lutheran say come up to the stage and we'll sprinkle its water we'll will lay hands and confirm the Holy Spirit upon you the Catholics will say come up here and take this little wafer and when you eat the wafer that then it'll be the Holy Eucharist and you'll be people partaking of the body of Christ and the Holy Spirit will come upon you a man is the the Baptist's a come up here and say I believe in my heart that the Lord Jesus Christ died for my sins and the Holy Spirit will come upon you it isn't like that it isn't according to those doctrines as the Pentecostals say just just get excited enough and utter out these words until you speak with tongues and then the Holy Ghost is upon you but let me tell you those are just almost trinkets of doctrines that is not what we're talking about we're talking about the everlasting almighty all-powerful God will come down and pour himself inside of you a men he will fill you so come into his house have respect unto his name and if you come and believe on him or confess your sins to him have respects under his name amen he will come and fill you with his own presence and then you'll become that everlasting resource upon the earth and you'll be the one that is now anointed to bind up the brokenhearted to set at liberty them that bruised to answer to you have the answer for the abuse victims you have the answer for those that been downtrodden you can go to the to the low to those that are in prison because you now are the one that has the answer for life's problems amen if you just come to him and drink came in a man why because they have to return back to righteousness a man we've been given everything that we have need of we're standing just like they stood in Haggai and it's time to go back to righteousness it's time to go back to restoration it's time to go back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's time to go in living day-in day-out according to the power of Almighty God amen because the land this Holy Ghost land that we live in is not like the land of Laodicea it's not like the land of Egypt or you live according to your own works your own doings your own shrines it's the land where you were in partnership with Jehovah amen and he will send his rain upon you in your in his new seasons to bring the fruit up in your own life amen amen and so what you do is you just keep just keep drinking and pushing just keep drinking and pushing drinking and pushing amen amen and as you'll push out the fruits of righteousness a man upon your own life amen amen God as good as any Saints amen I just wanted to read this quarter brother brands from possessing all things he said talking about the promise he said yet Abraham had a right to the promise and yet and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it there you are the believer today yet we're heir to all things work yet we're heir to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the Bible promises yet you have to fight every inch of it that's the way God's got it set up and it's always been that way you're honest the truth Saints if you want something you got to fight for it you got a call out for it you got to cry out for you say oh brother I wish I was a stronger Christian last for it cry out for it fight for it it's worth fighting for amen just as much in Haggai that temple was worth fighting for but they left the temple in ruins while they built their own houses amen and we can look back and say how could they do that it's so easy for him to say sixteen years that was enough time for you to build the temple that was enough time for you to build a house of worship yeah we'll sit in these church pews year after year after year in the same condition in the same way amen even though the scroll has been opened up the scroll has been read we've read all the promises we've heard enough sermons we've heard enough things and yet here we sit here we are where is the fruit of God in our lives amen God will send down his rain but we didn't plant the seed we planted the seed but we left when we went off to other things so God withheld the rain why because we're enig on the partnership we went back on the partnership it wasn't that they didn't return to the land they did return to the land but they didn't honor the partnership and so God said I am calling for a drought amen woe to us if we here in the last days experienced a drought in our own lives because God is coming back soon and we're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling eye I will be judged according to the things that we did amen we'll be we're gonna we're gonna have to answer for the life that God has given us upon this earth a man because God has given us the fountain of living waters but what have we done with it what fruits will we offer to him what have we been doing with all the things the promises that God has given to us a man ought to set us to a fear that somehow we've wasted our time here upon the earth Amen that we've wasted another year we've wasted another year we've wasted another year a man lay set there and they wasted 16 years with the proclamation of Cirus so in serie when God stirred up the heart of Sirius to write that Proclamation go back and build Jehovah house and they had their dream my seventy years I sat there in captivity waiting for a moment like that waiting for an opportunity and they had their opportunity when the opportunity came they let their opportunities sit in the dust Amen so we sitting there just like in Ephesians there God has blessed us with all spiritual blessings but we sit here with a grand opportunity but woe unto us if we don't enter into it amen amen you say brother branham I need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it it ain't gonna be easy I'm gonna tell you that you're gonna have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you've got a right to to Satan say give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord possessor of heavens and earth and I am his heir give it back amen amen that's what God does amen I am an heir of all things amen it's given to me I'm an heir I can claim everything that God promised me amen there you are it mine my you know it just has to be a boldness within us to know who we are to know where we stand and to know that we have the proclamation behind us we have the authority of a message behind us amen in the message this last day message is an authority amen because when God sends a prophet to bring a people out of something then they have an authority behind them to go in and March and do and be the people that God called them to be they had that authority behind them and so they can go and they and they don't have to just go oh I wonder what I should do here I wonder what I should do there well I'm afraid I don't want to do too much I don't want to do this remember God he gave the parable of the talents they meant and there were men that they were given God's own purchasing power that's what talent was it was money it was a purchasing power one man was given five talents another man was given two talents another man is given one talent they're given the purchasing power of God yes amen and they took the purchasing power of God and one man says I took your purchasing power I took it and I went and I doubled it another man says I took your two talents and I doubled them first man says I took the purchasing power of God and I buried it in the earth my and so do we have been given the purchasing power of God amen to call those things that are not as though they are amen if you need something call out for it cry out for it we otherwise if you do not cry out for it what are you doing you have the purchasing power of God in you right now yes you have it right now inside of you amen and even the weakest brother Brad said the weakest Saint when he gets on his knees causes Hell to tremble why because you have the purchasing power inside of you right now because you can cry out to God for it amen but what do you do if you you never cry out then you are that one that buried the purchasing power inside the dirt the bureau and body of flesh if you never cry out that scripture is talking of you and he said take away that from him what she seemed to have give it to somebody else and that man went out there crying and wailing gnashing teeth amen why because God gave them the talent yeah talent there is money it was God's own money God's own purchasing power and he buried it in the dirt and so God's own / God's purchasing power is his own word and faith and that word to make it come to pass amen and so when you take the word and you bury it inside yourself and you never put it to use then you are the one that keeps it buried in the earth amen and then you'll stand there in 16 years of being a Christian sitting on the Pew with no fruit to show for it then you are the one in Haggai says they spoke of much but it came too little you put yearned wages but he put them in a bag with holes in them and when you brought it in I blew on it why because my house is lying waste you didn't build a house of worship he didn't glorify God with your own life Amen you built your own house but you wouldn't build a house of praise in your own heart unto me a man you didn't worship me amen amen but God's placed the everlasting resource inside of us amen to call those things that are not as though they are but now it's up to you if you can write rise up in faith and speak those things out and use God's purchasing power to go and purchase you overcoming life in Christ amen to purchase you a victorious life in Christ to purchase you fruits that will never ever fail jesus said store up your treasure in heaven because those treasures can never be taken away from you a man then you'll have praise not of man but from praise from God himself and it wouldn't that glory wouldn't isn't that glorious that's what he do hey man let's just stand hey man I can just see Jesus there watching them celebrate watching them worship as they're carrying those jugs of water dancing and singing and shouting the light from the pillars shiny all over Jerusalem from a lion and everybody is worshipping and praising God and dancing and finally he couldn't stand any more and he says this is all speaking of me you come unto me and drink and I'll pour out unto you rivers of living water and your belly shall be that you will be like a tree planted by the rivers of living water amen and now that same promise is still available in to us amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father what a great opportunity we know that you have not withheld anything from your bride but you have given the proclamation all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus I've been given unto us according to Ephesians Lord we claim it if you don't know what else to do but just to say yes Lord yes and amen it's mine Lord I'm gonna be that Bible character I am gonna be that one in the last days that's fill with the Holy Ghost I don't have to be this denomination over here or this over here I am a standalone with Christ I am the Christian the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor bind up the brokenhearted to set at liberty those that are bruised to release the captives reach sight to the blind spirit of our God is upon me to do all those things so is the Spirit of the Lord God every truth and have the purchasing power within themselves if they would just cry out all things are possible to believe he's paid every debt he's restored all things and we live in the day of restoration all the years that read away from the right now are restored we're living like we are in the Garden of Eden before the fall all these promises were restored with the power of a proclamation a message that we can be anything where ever you want to be you can be it amen however you want to serve your Lord just get on your knees cry out to him and he will inspire you to serve he will inspire you to worship a man as your cry goes up into the heavens the Holy Spirit will go up alongside that cry and grab a hold of it he'll go up to where the altar is where the blood of lamb he'll make intercession for you based on your confession so as you confess lord I want to be a better believer Lord only be fill if you're willing ghost heart I want to be that light to the world Lord I want to be the one that the psalm is tipple the even if a stranger if a Hindu if a homosexual if anybody and no matter who they are where the faith is come unto me if they have respects under the name of Lord Jesus Christ that the Lord will reach out of me and out of my belly which shall flow rivers of living water and now we're the ones crying out come unto me in Greek come unto me and be restored come onto me and receive this everlasting resource and become a Christian that's our duty stand alone we're the bride it's us and all things are possible to them that belief to them that cry out Oh Lord let us fry them let this church begin to cry father let this church be restored to be a church this living in the promises of God to be a church of inspiration as they are inspired every day to live as a Christian as they are inspired to go speak to this brother as they are inspired to go speak to this one and then that they will plan out the messages it's been an hour and is given to them by the Holy God's Holy Ghost relations inspired church livvie moving and breathing by the Holy Ghost it's possible for Alma sent to us and we've sent here long enough we've gotten around this mountain long enough listen to the promises turn northward be going to the promises going to the land a man live
