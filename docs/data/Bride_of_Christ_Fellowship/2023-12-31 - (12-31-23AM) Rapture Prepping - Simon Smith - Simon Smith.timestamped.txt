[0:08] but if you could let's go to the
[0:09] scripture here I guys so we had a little
[0:12] fellowship at the at the house this uh
[0:18] yesterday and
[0:22] uh you could turn
[0:27] me me turn to Daniel or Deuteronomy
[0:32] three and then so brother cam like
[0:34] brother can you do this okay so you know
[0:37] I don't know about you brother Jess but
[0:38] I get stressed out when you have to do
[0:39] another service but Jess but Jesse's
[0:41] been doing this for a long
[0:42] time I'm not a pastor so I don't I do
[0:45] like once or twice a month that's it
[0:46] it's like okay okay and then uh when
[0:49] it's time you know a little stressed out
[0:52] so I was struggling I was like Lord why
[0:54] do I bring to your children here and
[0:55] brother Cam's like well let's just have
[0:56] at your house so I had quite a few
[0:58] people in the house yesterday and uh we
[1:01] had just a nice Fellowship there amen
[1:04] but but C wanted to do a study to keep
[1:06] it focused on the word obviously and not
[1:08] just messing around talking about work
[1:10] or whatever but just a word based study
[1:13] so
[1:15] amen uh the Lord kind of I feel like the
[1:18] Lord showed me a couple um powerful
[1:21] quotes that we'll he he at the end and
[1:23] just something to
[1:24] emphasize uh the
[1:27] sincerity uh the carefulness
[1:30] amen we must have with what God gave
[1:34] us um yes we want
[1:40] to now surely all of us you know we're
[1:43] all have faults and failures and we've
[1:46] fallen short many many times I know I
[1:48] have and we are trusting for the blood
[1:51] of Jesus Christ for those things you
[1:53] know yes
[1:54] um but in this
[1:57] day uh I have not realized until
[1:59] yesterday but there's been a great um
[2:02] thing placed upon us um in the message
[2:06] of the
[2:08] hour maybe like
[2:11] a a real warning if I could say it like
[2:15] that and we'll get that by God's grace
[2:16] today Lord will so amen and then tonight
[2:18] like brother Jesse said if if you would
[2:21] like you could do a little Thailand
[2:23] update there and things went really well
[2:26] um but we'll share those things we're
[2:28] doing tonight and
[2:30] I trust that' be a blessing so if we
[2:32] could turn to Deuteronomy 3 and we'll
[2:34] start at Verse 18 here and I got a
[2:37] little bit of reading here but I just
[2:38] want to I want to read this you're be
[2:40] standing here all the way probably to 29
[2:42] so from 18 says and I commanded you at
[2:45] that time saying the Lord your God hath
[2:48] given you this land to possess it you
[2:51] shall pass over armed before your
[2:53] brethren and the children of Israel all
[2:56] that are meat for war but your wives and
[2:58] your little ones and your cattle
[3:00] for I know that ye have much cattle
[3:02] shall abide in your cities which I have
[3:04] given you until the Lord hath given rest
[3:08] unto your
[3:09] brethren as well as unto you and unto
[3:12] and until they also possess the land
[3:15] which the Lord your God hath given them
[3:17] Beyond Jordan and then shall you return
[3:20] every man unto his possession which I
[3:22] have given you and I commanded Joshua at
[3:26] that time saying thine eyes have seen
[3:28] all to the Lord your God ha done unto
[3:30] these two kings so shall so shall the
[3:33] Lord do unto all the kingdoms whether
[3:35] thou passest amen ye shall not fear them
[3:38] for the Lord your God shall fight for
[3:40] you and I besought the Lord at that time
[3:43] saying oh Lord God thou Hast begun to
[3:46] show thy servant thy greatness and thy
[3:49] Mighty hand for what God is there in
[3:52] heaven or in Earth that can do can do
[3:56] according to thy works and according to
[3:58] thy might yes I pray thee let me go over
[4:02] now notice what God as as he they
[4:04] defeated the two kings and Moses saw
[4:07] that God was with Israel and he's like
[4:08] man I want to go in I I want to go in
[4:11] this land with them so he besought the
[4:14] Lord he says I pray thee let me go
[4:18] over and see the good land that is
[4:21] beyond
[4:23] Jordan that goodly mountain in
[4:26] Lebanon but the Lord was wroth with me
[4:29] for your sakes and would not hear me and
[4:33] the Lord said unto me let suffice thee
[4:36] speak no more of me unto me of this
[4:40] matter get me up into get thee up into
[4:43] the top of Pisa and lift up thine eyes
[4:48] Westward and northward and Southward and
[4:50] Eastward and behold it was and With
[4:52] Thine Eyes for Thou shalt not go over
[4:56] this Jordan but charge Joshua and
[4:58] encourage him and strength strengthen
[4:59] him for uh he shall go over before this
[5:03] people and he shall cause them to
[5:04] inherit the land which uh Thou shalt
[5:07] see so we Abode in the land in the
[5:10] valley over against
[5:13] bethor um if we could then real quick
[5:17] here turn to Hebrews
[5:22] 11 so it might be a little bit of
[5:24] everything here in this little study I
[5:26] just but we trust it is a blessing
[5:28] Hebrews 11 and
[5:32] 5 115 by
[5:36] faith Enoch was translated that he
[5:38] should not see death and was not found
[5:41] because God had translated him for
[5:43] before his translation he had this
[5:46] testimony that he pleased God amen amen
[5:50] so let's say a word of prayer Hallelujah
[5:52] bow our heads humble our
[5:55] hearts dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you
[5:58] and Lord so been so good and so kind

[6:16] that this is how you train up a child

[7:06] we love you bless the saints of God lord
[7:09] yes Jesus Lord help me Lord to bring
[7:12] forth this little thought God lord may
[7:14] you speak tonight this morning Lord we
[7:16] love you in the name of Jesus Christ
[7:18] amen seated
[7:22] sorry at the portion of scripture there
[7:24] in Deuteronomy is gu I've
[7:28] never
[7:30] when when we get to it you'll see why
[7:32] it's so
[7:33] important um so this uh
[7:38] morning connect
[7:41] something just dropped
[7:44] off let's see here this
[7:49] is
[7:52] see anyhow um the Lord's been so good
[7:55] he's kept us this whole year amen and
[7:59] we could literally take a piece of paper
[8:01] each one of us I could take a a blank
[8:03] sheet here and pass it each one and you
[8:05] could start from today yesterday and
[8:08] start writing the testimonies throughout
[8:10] the year of everything that God has
[8:12] protected you from everything he's
[8:15] brought to you every and then even that
[8:17] think about every Revelation you've
[8:19] heard over this Pulpit every Revelation
[8:21] you've been at home and read in the
[8:23] scripture and listen to the tapes and uh
[8:26] things that God has shown you and um
[8:30] it's uh it's you can't match it I mean
[8:32] he's been so good uh and I'll say with
[8:34] this the the spiritual food is by far
[8:37] more important than anything natural we
[8:39] could take because it's the spiritual
[8:41] food that gives us faith that raises our
[8:44] belief that all things are possible that
[8:47] he is the same yesterday today and
[8:49] forever and that God is going to perform
[8:51] his good W work and his Good Will in
[8:53] your life amen amen and I don't believe
[8:55] as the song would say I don't believe
[8:57] he's brought us this far to leave that's
[9:00] right amen wait a second he called us
[9:03] out of denomination he called us out of
[9:06] the world to miss a Rapture SS of God I
[9:09] believe that God has called you to make
[9:11] this Rapture amen and I believe we're
[9:14] going to make this Rapture because I
[9:16] there's what else why would I I don't
[9:19] think any of us are last year we all
[9:20] believe the same word and we're pressing
[9:23] towards
[9:24] it we want to be found in that number
[9:27] now there's a great challenge this this
[9:29] whole life here since you've heard the
[9:31] message U or or the the the the word of
[9:34] God for this hour there's been a
[9:35] challenge we have a challenge now to
[9:37] believe it or to doubt it to reject it
[9:40] those sort of things and then uh other
[9:42] things come with that challenge as well
[9:45] uh so this morning I'd like to teach
[9:46] Maybe by God's grace I don't know how
[9:48] long this willo I actually have a lot of
[9:49] slides but um the last 15 or so or maybe
[9:53] something I could just touch and go
[9:55] maybe however but uh I I want to teach
[9:58] on this Rapture prepping so um I I
[10:03] believe we're close uh you there's just
[10:06] something stirring this I like this
[10:08] there's something holding me there's
[10:10] something keeping me from just who knows
[10:13] whatever the the devil could anoint me
[10:15] to do or however or pull me out of this
[10:17] gospel but God has kept me the entire
[10:20] time he has kept you this entire time
[10:23] and because why because there's
[10:24] something about this word there's
[10:26] something that's different when I was
[10:28] denomination they we went through the
[10:30] same old studies every year money and
[10:33] finances and Co dating and and and and
[10:36] and romance and this in the in the in
[10:39] the church you hear those things and
[10:40] it's just a it's just a a circle a
[10:43] spiral just going around the mountain
[10:45] again just the same old things and the
[10:48] I'll never forget the one day I was
[10:49] sitting in there and I the thought came
[10:50] to me and this was when I was really
[10:52] trying to be Chris I said is this all
[10:54] there is in the
[10:56] Bible and that's when the Lord started
[10:58] hungering that where did that thought
[10:59] come from it had to come from the Lord
[11:01] Jesus Christ and then I started seeking
[11:03] the Lord and say Lord where is what is
[11:05] the truth and then he brought this and
[11:07] now all my questions I'll say this have
[11:10] been answered amen AMJ in fact that the
[11:13] Lord continually gives Revelation I was
[11:15] in Thailand when I get the chance the
[11:17] lord gave me another powerful
[11:19] Revelation on baptism and it was just
[11:23] marvelous and I I've wondered this for
[11:26] 20 years another another one of them
[11:27] things I've been long long and waited a
[11:30] long time to and then then a brother
[11:32] said a certain thing and then all of a
[11:33] sudden I was like there it
[11:37] is and I said we have so much spiritual
[11:43] Firepower the sword of the spirit is
[11:45] sharper than anything amen and it's all
[11:48] true so uh by God's grace let's get into
[11:51] this Rapture prepping so we want to be
[11:54] obviously we know the Rapture is the
[11:56] great thing promised for us in this hour
[11:59] is the great thing there's great and
[12:00] there's terrible right promised that
[12:02] come after Malachi 4 at the time Malachi
[12:04] 4 there's great things for the bride and
[12:07] terrible things for the Lost
[12:09] amen so we want to be found in the great
[12:12] things in the number of the Blessed
[12:15] people I like that and holy amen who are
[12:17] counted worthy to make the first
[12:20] resurrection there the Bible talks about
[12:22] in The Book of Revelation so uh in this
[12:25] we want to jump here to Genesis 5 and 21
[12:29] just we'll just read this real quick
[12:31] here and we can go there to now uh verse
[12:34] 23 and and and all the days of Enoch
[12:37] were
[12:38] 365 years and Enoch walked with God and
[12:42] he was not for God took him so we see a
[12:46] man right here and we know that he
[12:48] according to the scripture he was the
[12:50] seventh from Adam right and that seventh
[12:52] has a special meaning to us as our
[12:55] wonderful sister I can't which one said
[12:57] it there about what does the number
[12:59] seven mean and she said the seven Church
[13:01] ages and I was just like still I'm still
[13:04] flored that that just popped right out
[13:05] of her mouth that she knew that and
[13:07] praise God that's they are being taught
[13:09] and trained up in the Lord right that's
[13:12] what to class for that right sure now as
[13:14] we uh continue on Enoch was walked with
[13:17] God and he was not for God took him so
[13:19] he was the he was literally the one of
[13:22] the proving types that what the Rapture
[13:26] is
[13:27] pre-tribulation the Bible what God says
[13:29] I'll not punish the righteous with the
[13:31] wicked but he I've got something special
[13:33] for my bride amen something for the
[13:35] people who God has I'll say this God has
[13:38] visited with the word of God as as God
[13:42] himself came down to Abraham and visited
[13:44] him right before the destruction of
[13:46] Sodom gomorra that exactly that exact
[13:48] same thing not in the exact way but that
[13:52] exact same type of thing has taken place
[13:54] in this day God has said what a
[13:56] messenger and what brought us the word
[13:58] revealed R it yes Flash the
[14:01] sign then now what we have received the
[14:04] true word of God Amen Hallelujah and
[14:06] what did he say about Abraham what did
[14:08] he say to the two angels He says I will
[14:10] what how can I hide these things from
[14:12] Abraham right how can I hide these from
[14:14] my friend Abol and Abraham was chosen he
[14:17] was elected he was called to what be
[14:20] God's friend and that's exactly what
[14:22] we're uh I believe that we sit in the
[14:24] position that place this morning am God
[14:27] has revealed these things to us and
[14:29] that's a special thing God does not hide
[14:32] does not reveal his Secrets his mystery
[14:34] to just any certain kind of people he
[14:37] not the Bible says that we're not
[14:39] supposed to cast our Pearls Before
[14:41] Swine do you think God would cast us
[14:44] Pearls Before Swine I don't think so but
[14:46] he'll give his pearls what to his
[14:50] wife for
[14:53] you believe that is what God is trying
[14:56] to do here is show you he's giving your
[15:00] his his spiritual gifts to you putting
[15:03] on the ornaments what of of the Hidden
[15:05] man the character uh the I was like this
[15:07] the revealed word and I'll say and and
[15:10] there's one thing I don't know if I've
[15:11] taught this here or not um but the way
[15:14] that God displays love is what he
[15:17] Reveals His word to his wife brother
[15:21] brother R always alluded to him writing
[15:23] letters to Ma and Ma writing letters to
[15:25] him and he said it's just like this God
[15:28] there's things hidden in the scripture
[15:30] there's things hidden right in there
[15:32] that what is only revealed to his wife
[15:34] that only his wife can catch I'll say it
[15:36] like that Hallelujah right so amen so
[15:38] that's what we're uh believing uh by
[15:41] God's grace so everybody thinks that you
[15:43] know Enoch was some great phenomenal
[15:46] revelated beyond all conditions there
[15:48] was no one more intelligent more this or
[15:50] that about Enoch Enoch was just so in
[15:52] our minds we say oh my goodness here's
[15:55] the guy that made the Rapture here's the
[15:57] guy that took the body change here's the
[15:59] guy that did not see death even without
[16:01] the Holy Ghost that's right brother but
[16:04] what did it the Bible said what did it
[16:06] require what did Enoch uh require uh uh
[16:09] to make the Rapture it was only Faith
[16:14] Hallelujah without the Holy Ghost he
[16:16] only needed Faith now in this
[16:20] hour and in this
[16:24] day God has already come 2,000 years ago
[16:28] in a flesh and he had the spirit within
[16:31] him so he was not just a man right right
[16:35] in fact the Bible says it was the blood
[16:36] of God it was not Jewish blood it was
[16:38] the blood of God and then now when that
[16:40] spiritual blood mixed with the spirit of
[16:43] God he became he was what a different
[16:46] kind of creature he was the firstborn of
[16:48] many Brethren and the only way that you
[16:51] can actually get like him is to receive
[16:53] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[16:56] receive his filling in your spirit and
[16:59] sealed off to the day of redemption
[17:01] right
[17:02] am so but we're going to need Faith to
[17:06] make this Rapture in this day and how
[17:08] are we going to get that kind of faith
[17:11] that kind of faith will only come from
[17:13] what the holy
[17:15] spirit amen now
[17:18] amen
[17:20] sorry when you're writing in the car you
[17:22] don't really get to exercise and get
[17:24] that you know in the morning you're just
[17:25] trying to you know I get to work you're
[17:26] trying to you start
[17:28] breaking up you know and feel better and
[17:32] getting kind of like the mo something I
[17:34] fresh out of the
[17:36] truck so no notice now what was Enoch
[17:40] and I believe brother Jess had taught
[17:42] this a long time ago and he always stuck
[17:44] with
[17:45] me justtin how Enoch was just a simple
[17:49] uh uh what Shepherd farmer un
[17:53] uneducated not nothing great in the
[17:56] world he was just a Simple Man yes he
[18:00] says but the
[18:02] elected Enoch Noah were shepherds
[18:04] Farmers humble Not educated not smart
[18:07] not not but knowing their God now that
[18:09] was the
[18:11] key and the only way you can know God is
[18:14] of god reveals himself to you amen how
[18:17] he going to reveal himself he's going to
[18:19] be in the word amen God is the word amen
[18:24] now that's the key right
[18:27] there do we know the word and I I'll
[18:31] just jump a little bit have we added or
[18:33] taken from it I want to that as like a
[18:36] premises right there you're going to see
[18:38] this thing you're going to see this at
[18:40] the end here by God's grace
[18:42] now so here's Enoch it was nothing
[18:46] special about him but something in them
[18:49] moving calling will get to that of the B
[18:51] so here that that moving and calling
[18:53] should be in you right there Hallelujah
[18:55] why are you here this morning why did
[18:57] you why did you wake up up early on a
[18:59] Sunday morning come to this specific
[19:01] assembly you could have went to a
[19:02] Baptist Catholic however but you decided
[19:04] to come here what pulled you what moved
[19:06] you what motivated you to come right
[19:08] here this morning at this specific
[19:11] location under that headship that
[19:13] believes this word amen amen that was
[19:16] the Holy Spirit right there I believe
[19:17] all my heart God has been faithful amen
[19:21] now now look at
[19:23] this it says 500 years he walked before
[19:26] God walking walking the light with with
[19:28] a testimony that everything God said he
[19:30] did it well I've been I've been
[19:32] unfaithful there okay I'm not
[19:35] been I've not been perfect right but
[19:38] that's see the difference between us and
[19:40] that is that we have the blood of Jesus
[19:42] Christ amen he covers all
[19:46] mistakes everything every blessing I may
[19:48] have missed or everything i' I've done
[19:50] or this or that that was a faults or
[19:52] however or uh cheated here lied there
[19:55] whatever it's all covered by the blood
[19:56] of Jesus Christ amen amen and I'm
[19:58] thankful that even now when I have been
[20:01] a Christian when I still fall and fail
[20:03] and have FAL that God is still faithful
[20:06] to be up there in the intercessory booth
[20:08] there what putting his blood on the
[20:11] mercy seat for what my transgressions
[20:14] amen and I'm the most grateful for what
[20:18] those iniquities of mine that are not
[20:20] that I that are washed away amen because
[20:23] every time we fall and fail there's
[20:25] something in my heart that says Lord God
[20:26] forgive me Lord God wash me one more
[20:29] time we got to check up every minute
[20:32] every hour every week every second of
[20:35] our days every every part of our life
[20:37] we've got to check up and be ready right
[20:39] amen amen sure that's right he says he
[20:43] says 500 years he walked before God
[20:45] walking walking in the light with a
[20:47] testimony that everything God said he
[20:48] did it he didn't displease him what the
[20:51] Lord said Enoch done it amen
[20:55] now that was the
[20:57] Enoch
[21:01] Covenant that's their type
[21:03] right but if you look at the Abraham the
[21:06] abrahamic Covenant is nothing that I had
[21:08] to do is something God was going to do
[21:10] amen and I believe if we be children of
[21:13] Abraham which what we are because we are
[21:15] able to hear the voice of God in this
[21:17] day that what we will believe the word
[21:20] of God and that will be counted as
[21:22] righteousness to us amen sure sure he
[21:26] says now he was a type of
[21:28] remember he says the ark is a law is a
[21:30] type to the Jews and the 144,000 is
[21:33] carried over which is Noah and his Bunch
[21:35] but Enoch went home just a little bit
[21:37] before the flood you know that so Enoch
[21:39] just kept walking in the light just so
[21:41] one day he felt his feet getting off the
[21:43] ground he just kept walking and walked
[21:45] up into Glory without even dying SS of
[21:48] God amen amen that really happened and
[21:51] that's going to happen again for you
[21:53] amenallah it's a promise well brother it
[21:56] sure does sound like far off something
[21:59] like in a comic book or in a movie or
[22:01] however but SS of God this was before
[22:04] comic book and movies ever took place
[22:06] there nothing where do you think they
[22:08] got the inspiration for someone to cany
[22:10] where do you think they got the
[22:11] inspiration for someone to transport
[22:13] telepathically or or on Star Trek and be
[22:16] me up Scotty right where do you think
[22:17] they got that they got that from there
[22:20] Satan is always a a mimicker he's always
[22:23] an impersonator of all things amen that
[22:25] God has and this is what and that's and
[22:27] remember well I don't know how but when
[22:30] I first started watching when I you know
[22:31] my dad had me watching Star
[22:33] Trek I was like they go or whatever and
[22:37] they like they disappear and they go
[22:39] somewhere else I'm like that's
[22:42] crazy man that's that's that's amazing
[22:44] is that impossible
