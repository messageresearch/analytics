[0:16] grace at the end of this OCC I'll have

[0:26] brandom's own handwriting on his own
[0:28] sermon notes you ever seen knows brother

[0:38] treat to see brother Ram's short
[0:40] hand hallelujah what a blessing God sent
[0:43] us a prophet in this day amen so let's
[0:46] go to uh 1 Thessalonians 4 I think it's
[0:49] 16 and 17 if I'm not mistaken God's
[0:52] grace we look at the shout voice Trump
[0:53] I'll be dealing with the shout here
[0:55] today uh by the grace of the Lord
[1:05] so let's read uh I'll read 16 and then
[1:08] we can all read 17 for the Lord himself
[1:11] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:13] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[1:15] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:18] shall rise first let's read this one two
[1:20] three then we which are alive and remain
[1:24] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:27] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:30] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:33] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[1:35] of his word you can be seated God bless
[1:41] you all right so we'll see how far we
[1:43] can get here on this uh sermon you know
[1:46] we've looked at brother Bram sermon from
[1:47] December 4th
[1:49] 1965 uh this is part seven of the coming
[1:51] of the lord The Rapture mystery I still
[1:53] got a couple more sermons to preach I
[1:55] got God in Simplicity and then the
[1:56] spoken words Original Seed in this
[1:58] little series here now in this
[2:00] particular sermon brother Rams addressed
[2:02] scoffers in the last days as second
[2:05] Peter said the importance of Revelation
[2:07] was the second part and then you looked
[2:09] at uh election so going back even
[2:12] further if person has Revelation then
[2:14] it's it's likely they're elected to
[2:15] eternal life um and then we he looked at
[2:18] types of the Rapture with Enoch and so
[2:21] forth and then uh we we're looking at
[2:23] the shout the voice and the Trump uh
[2:26] last time we looked at this before
[2:27] brother cim had come uh to preach for us
[2:30] so now we're going to pick up here and
[2:31] look at uh the three parts of the
[2:34] Rapture again uh by God's
[2:36] grace now in this particular sermon
[2:38] brother randam says uh he addresses the
[2:41] shout voice Trump three times so I want
[2:45] you to hear uh kind of what he says here
[2:48] again to make a point you know
[2:51] uh some people uh believe the shout
[2:54] started when brother brandom opened the
[2:55] seals that's what I believe um but we
[2:59] don't have a thus sayith the Lord on it
[3:00] there's actually very few quotes on
[3:02] shout voice Trump I found eight today
[3:05] that's a very small sample size none of
[3:08] them are thus sayith the Lord uh some
[3:10] people don't believe that uh because it
[3:12] can it can seem kind of uh odd uh you
[3:15] think the Rapture started in 1963 well
[3:18] in that's the way I believe it yes
[3:20] because the shout the shout is Jesus
[3:23] Christ himself the shout has to go out
[3:25] to gather everybody together right the
[3:27] shout it's a it's a stimulating cry in
[3:30] the Greek there's got to be a shout to
[3:33] gather the people and so yes I do
[3:35] believe the Rapture is a process uh just
[3:38] like uh The Exodus was a process with
[3:41] Moses it was a process it just wasn't
[3:43] one instant it was an entire process and
[3:46] brother R even calls our Rapture the
[3:48] Third Exodus so again another testimony
[3:52] uh for this but again we don't have a
[3:54] thus sayith the Lord either way we have
[3:56] a thus sayith the Bible but we don't
[3:58] have any particular interpret ation thus
[4:00] sayith the Lord so that's how I've
[4:03] always taught it I've always taught it
[4:04] that way I feel like I'm just getting
[4:06] more Revelation here as as time goes on
[4:09] uh but again I'm open to correction if
[4:10] I'm wrong I just want to be right now
[4:13] what's notable I'll get to a little bit
[4:14] what's notable out of these eight quotes
[4:17] um uh brother brandham uh doesn't really
[4:20] give uh he's I'm sorry on four of them
[4:22] he's just reading the scripture and then
[4:25] on uh three of them as you'll see he
[4:27] actually teaches the shout was his
[4:29] message message his message all the
[4:31] revelations and the finished mystery of
[4:33] God the prophecies on three of them he
[4:35] says that was the message to get the
[4:37] bride ready okay and then on two of them
[4:40] I'll show you he just says uh one he
[4:42] said there's a big clap of Thunder but
[4:44] he get doesn't give a verse and then he
[4:46] gives another one uh where he just talks
[4:49] about the Corporal body of Jesus coming
[4:50] back which that's what the Rapture will
[4:52] be the Rapture will be the Corporal body
[4:53] of Jesus in a glorified condition
[4:55] meeting us in the air by God's grace so
[4:58] that's just a little
[5:00] introduction there so there's three
[5:02] parts of the Rapture shout voice Trump
[5:04] and in this part of the the sermon I'm
[5:06] now looking at the third time he's
[5:08] mentioned it the first time he mentioned
[5:11] he said a shout what is a shout it's the
[5:13] message going forth first the living
[5:15] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[5:18] now look at that look at and look at the
[5:20] verse he uses Amos 3:7 you want to put
[5:23] that up there h brother Ram uses uh Amos
[5:26] 37 as a verse uh God surely God will do
[5:30] nothing but he revealed his secret unto
[5:32] his servants the prophets now leave that
[5:34] up there just for a moment this is the
[5:35] first scripture brother Braham uses to
[5:37] say the shout will be a message the
[5:40] living bread bringing forth the bride
[5:43] and again we don't have thus sayi the
[5:44] Lord but I just want want you to see how
[5:46] brother Ram taught it right before he
[5:48] passed away and I'm not saying it was
[5:50] thus sayi the Lord I'm just saying this
[5:51] is how he taught it and I'll show you
[5:52] the notes you can actually see it in his
[5:54] notes his own handwritten
[5:56] writing so I don't feel bad so bad about
[5:58] my handwriting anymore I used to but I
[6:00] don't feel so bad you know CU We All
[6:02] We're Men we're just doing our best uh
[6:05] you you'll you'll be real tickled
[6:06] brother Jose and brother Williams saw
[6:07] when we went to brandom Tabernacle they
[6:09] actually have these his actual notes
[6:11] hanging up there in the voice of God
[6:12] Recordings office now of course I
[6:14] believe that's an office of mostly
[6:16] idolatry right but I do respect them for
[6:18] printing books but they're they most of
[6:20] them have the idolatrous spirit so
[6:22] that's the first mention I've already
[6:24] preached that to you in earlier sermons
[6:26] oh yeah and then he reads another one he
[6:27] says we've come through the church ages
[6:28] but we're promis in the last days
[6:30] according to Malachi 4 that there would
[6:31] be return again a prophet in the land so
[6:34] now pull up Malachi 45 and 6 AAA so
[6:37] here's the first two verses he uses how
[6:39] many you think these are familiar verses
[6:41] to us very familiar right even down the
[6:43] little children have you heard me use
[6:44] these verses before for sure yeah we've
[6:47] gone through these behold I'll send you
[6:49] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[6:51] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[6:52] this he ties this in with a shout right
[6:54] you can listen to yourself I I would
[6:56] encourage you I would say if I'm wrong
[6:59] you know correct me please correct me
[7:00] somebody correct me I'm this is exactly
[7:02] what brother Ram said uh about uh the
[7:05] shout he says and he shall turn the
[7:07] heart of the fathers to the children and
[7:08] the Heart of the children to their
[7:09] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[7:12] with the curse so our scripture we know
[7:14] this first part right here was John the
[7:15] Baptist he turned the heart of the
[7:17] fathers Apostolic fathers to the
[7:19] children or the second coming of Christ
[7:21] and the Heart of the children that's us
[7:23] the Believers at the second coming of
[7:24] Christ back to the Apostolic Pentecostal
[7:27] fathers okay and how is it done it's by
[7:29] the spirit of Elijah okay all right so
[7:32] that's the first two verses brother uses
[7:34] now the second time he he quotes it in
[7:36] the same Rapture sermon he says there's
[7:38] a shout what is it is a message to get
[7:40] the people together a message comes
[7:43] forth now he says first now lamp
[7:46] trimming time rise and trim your lamps
[7:48] now we know that's Matthew 25 we're not
[7:49] going to read that one honey he said but
[7:51] it's lamp trimming time lamp trimmy time
[7:54] it's Malachi 4 time it's Luke
[7:57] 17:30 okay so those are all familiar
[8:00] right get your lamp trimmed right uh so
[8:02] you can have the oil burning which the
[8:03] oil is the what the baptism of the Holy
[8:05] Ghost so this is all the shout this is
[8:08] all he uses all these verses on the
[8:09] shout two uh three four yeah four
[8:13] because he uses Malachi four again he
[8:15] said the shout is Malachi four time
[8:18] that's why that's why so many preachers
[8:19] in the message believe that because
[8:21] brother Ram said the shout is Malachi
[8:23] four time it's a message getting the
[8:25] bride ready Hallelujah the bride the
[8:28] bride it's getting the bride ready
[8:29] hallelujah how many getting ready
[8:31] tonight Hallelujah and church again we
[8:34] just saw seven I just baptized 17
[8:36] Junction City Saints and that that's God
[8:39] getting his bride ready right the
[8:42] Rapture couldn't happen without them the
[8:43] Rapture could happen with God sending
[8:45] Lena Hallelujah right it had to happen
[8:48] and they really like your testimony so
[8:49] far so it's really awesome to see that
[8:52] Hallelujah especially the sisters that's
[8:53] why I knew i' that's why I like to get
[8:54] the sisters testimony because they want
[8:56] some encouragement they want to know has
[8:58] sisters been through what I've been
[8:59] through and and God has moved amongst
[9:01] you guys or
[9:02] gals our sister is so powerfully I
[9:04] wanted to share it by God's grace now
[9:07] Luke 17:30 is the day of the son of man
[9:09] that's brother Ram's prophetic gift as
[9:11] as the son of man as a prophet the son
[9:14] of man Jesus Christ giving brother
[9:15] brandham the Messiah sign to tell people
[9:18] the secrets and thoughts and Tents of
[9:20] their heart that's Luke 17:30 even thus
[9:22] shall it be in the day when the son of
[9:23] man is revealed this is the shout
[9:26] brother R's tying all these verses in
[9:27] with a shout now I've already preached
[9:29] all those to you now here's the new one
[9:30] where I pick up I'm about an hour and 20
[9:33] minutes into this sermon and it's a it's
[9:35] a less than two hour sermon he says
[9:37] shout a messenger getting the people
[9:40] ready and then he goes
[9:42] into uh the the voice of the
[9:44] Resurrection he says the same voice that
[9:46] called Lazarus from the grave that'll be
[9:48] the voice of Jesus Calling uh uh the the
[9:51] dead in Christ alive and the last thing
[9:53] is a trump uh a trump is a calling
[9:56] together brother R said calling everyone
[9:58] to the the the marriage the bride supper
[10:01] the lamb supper with the bride in the
[10:03] sky the marriage supper of the Lamb so
[10:05] does everybody see that the shout was
[10:06] brother Ram's message it's still going
[10:08] out right that's what he taught in this
[10:10] sermon I know he didn't teach it
[10:11] everywhere else but he had very few
[10:12] quotes on it the second is Jesus will
[10:14] call his voice will call forth the dead
[10:16] in Christ so that'll be brother brandom
[10:18] that'll be Paul Peter James John the
[10:21] dead in Christ rise first hopefully we
[10:23] see them by God's grace to raise our
[10:25] faith and then the Trump is the voice of
[10:28] Jesus as well where our bodies are
[10:30] changed in a moment twinkling of an eye
[10:33] Hallelujah so those are the three steps
[10:34] of the Rapture brother tells us that he
[10:36] goes over this three times in this
[10:38] sermon the
[10:40] Rapture and then he got then he says it
[10:42] a fourth time the first things comes
[10:44] forth is his message calling the bride
[10:47] together Hallelujah so he says it he
[10:50] says it uh four times okay so I'm going
[10:53] to just go over this again what is the
[10:55] shout he said it's the message going
[10:57] forth the living bread bringing forth
[10:59] the bride so this connects to Malachi 4
[11:02] again all those scriptures that we we
[11:03] use
[11:05] there and so if the bride is still being
[11:07] gathered like The Junction City Saints
[11:09] then the shout still going forth and the
[11:11] church said right we're still Gathering
[11:14] bride members Hallelujah and hopefully
[11:16] that brother there Derek in the prison
[11:17] is calling bride members too because
[11:20] they can recognize Lord Jesus Christ is
[11:22] the name of the father son Holy Ghost
[11:24] amen hallelujah like Anna Patrick and
[11:27] Claude recognized this summer Hallelujah
[11:30] bride members amen hallelujah praise God
[11:33] that's right it's the living bread
[11:35] bringing forth the living bride
[11:37] Hallelujah then he says it's the the the
[11:39] shout is the message to get the people
[11:42] together calling the people together
[11:46] Hallelujah and then he says the message
[11:48] is lamp trimming time Malachi four time
[11:50] Luke 173 time hallelujah it's that shout
[11:54] it's a in it's a stimulating cry shout
[11:58] get ready the the bridegroom cometh go
[12:00] you out to meet him
[12:02] Hallelujah and again I'll say like this
[12:04] again Saints if our lamps are still
[12:06] being
[12:07] trimmed then our lives are still getting
[12:09] in order then the shout is still
[12:12] sounding church if your life was in
[12:14] order you'd already be dead or raptured
[12:17] right right and so that's the confidence
[12:19] we have the saints that have gone on
[12:21] died before like brother brandom they
[12:23] were already ready for the Rapture when
[12:25] when God chose to take them they were
[12:26] ready they were as mature as they were
[12:28] going to be just like a wheat grain
[12:30] being ripened at the right time it's
[12:32] mature as it's going to be hallelujah
[12:35] amen so that's the confidence we have no
[12:36] matter what age God uh calls these
[12:38] Believers home whether it's younger or
[12:40] older they're in the right condition God
[12:42] knows they're ripe hallelujah amen it
[12:45] has to be or else God uh God's wrong but
[12:48] no God is God God is uh trimming our
[12:51] lamps Hallelujah uh he he's getting us
[12:53] ready he's getting us uh he's letting us
[12:56] hear the message so our lives are being
[12:58] prepared for the coming of the Lord
[13:01] hallelujah then he says again a
[13:02] messenger getting the people ready
[13:05] calling the bride
[13:07] together Oh Glory that's what I heard I
[13:09] got I got called out of denominations
[13:12] into the bride age which is just the
[13:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost there's five
[13:16] times brother says bride age he just
[13:17] means the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[13:19] not some separate age uh outside of Leo
[13:22] or something like that we're still
[13:23] living in leoda but we're in uh we're in
[13:26] the time where the Holy Ghost is falling
[13:28] we're born born again we're bride
[13:30] members Hallelujah in other words we're
[13:31] we're the bride sitting together in
[13:33] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[13:35] Hallelujah so many people try to miss
[13:36] that they they they spiritualize it they
[13:39] they get people off track off into a
[13:41] bunch of nonsense but uh we pray for
[13:43] them I pray for
[13:44] them all right
[13:47] now let me read you some other quotes
[13:49] now so I just read you those uh three or
[13:51] four quotes where brother ram calls the
[13:53] shout a certain thing now a week before
[13:57] he preached the Rapture he called the
[13:59] shout here he didn't he didn't he didn't
[14:01] uh call the shout the message he said
[14:02] this he's praying he said dear God he
[14:04] said it's going to be a time like this
[14:07] when there really will be a clap of
[14:08] Thunder someday and the Son of God shall
[14:11] descend from heaven with a shout with
[14:12] the voice of the Archangel and the Trump
[14:14] of God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[14:17] and each one of us knows and we're aware
[14:18] tonight father that we're going to have
[14:20] to answer for every word we give and
[14:21] every word we say even the thoughts
[14:24] that's in our hearts we're going to
[14:25] answer for it okay so this was a week
[14:27] before now did he give scripture
[14:30] anybody's I don't see any anyone's
[14:32] welcome to correct me after service he
[14:33] didn't give any Scripture he just said
[14:35] there's going to come a clap of Thunder
[14:37] someday he didn't say seven
[14:39] Thunders okay he said a clap of Thunder
[14:42] he doesn't give a verse I read before
[14:44] and after he doesn't give a verse but
[14:46] then a week later he said he lists all
[14:48] these verses Luke 17:30 Malachi 4
[14:50] Matthew 25 uh he lists all these verses
[14:53] Amos
[14:55] 3:7 so you just have to take this and uh
[14:58] we just he didn't give us a scripture so
[15:01] we just have to look at it and say okay
[15:02] well uh we'll just have to uh be kind
[15:05] right and just do our best to rightly
[15:06] divide the word of truth right can
[15:08] everybody see
[15:09] that now the ne the only other time or
[15:12] I'm sorry there's two other times he
[15:13] actually used a scripture one was in
[15:15] 1962 so three years earlier in July we
[15:20] would see Jesus he said I believe in his
[15:22] literal coming Corporal body descending
[15:25] from the heavens with a shout with the
[15:26] voice of the Archangel the Trump of God
[15:29] the dead in Christ shall rise but his
[15:30] spirit is here with us he doesn't list
[15:33] any other scriptures he just says when
[15:35] the shout voice Trump it's the it's the
[15:37] the Corporal Body of Christ okay now is
[15:40] the Corporal Body of Christ here now
[15:43] right now during the shout no so see
[15:45] some people will they might take that
[15:47] quote over the quotes from The Rapture
[15:49] but to me there's more scriptures with
[15:51] the Rapture quotes so that's why I go
[15:53] with that okay but if somebody wants to
[15:56] believe the shout isn't until the
[15:58] literal Corporal body of Jesus is in the
[16:00] meeting in there that's fine they can
[16:01] believe that that that's wonderful I
[16:03] mean brother R said the main thing is to
[16:04] get ready for his coming Hallelujah
[16:06] that's the main thing amen but I think
[16:09] everybody can agree there is brother R's
[16:12] message is still going out and people
[16:13] are still getting their lamps trimmed
[16:15] Hallelujah are you with me right we see
[16:18] it in Junction City right we people are
[16:20] still getting their lamps trimmed
[16:22] Hallelujah there's still a sh I'm sorry
[16:25] there a shout there there's still a
[16:26] message going out we can see that and
[16:29] brother R tied it in to shout voice
[16:31] Trump at the end of his life but if you
[16:33] want to stay with the July that's 62
[16:35] that's fine people can have that okay
[16:38] what what we see is that he never taught
[16:39] on the shout very thoroughly until that
[16:42] last sermon but then he was rushed by
[16:44] the woman at the back Lord have mercy on
[16:46] that woman on the day of on the day of
[16:48] judgment that hotel owner she was
[16:50] rushing brother brandom out and you can
[16:51] tell brother br's rushing to try to
[16:52] finish the sermon if you haven't
[16:53] listened to it you should listen to it
[16:55] he's doing his best uh now the only
[16:58] other time he used the scripture was
[16:59] Matthew 24:40 you want to pull that up
[17:01] there hun and I already preached this
[17:03] one to you you won't remember don't feel
[17:05] bad it's from the sudden Seeker going
[17:07] away 1958 when I preached that sermon
[17:08] remember uh uh what was the bombing
[17:13] Pearl Harbor remember I preach on Pearl
[17:14] Harbor brother William was still here
[17:16] okay Pearl Harbor how brother used that
[17:18] to tell people you got to be ready any
[17:20] time for the Rapture because the
[17:22] judgment's on the way
[17:25] Hallelujah I know everybody's calling
[17:27] this a golden day for America but we'll
[17:28] see if
[17:29] if they actually let president Trump
[17:31] into office and then we'll see how they
[17:32] fight him we'll see nobody knows for
[17:35] sure I'd say say like this it's only a
[17:37] golden age for the bride hallelujah it's
[17:40] a golden age for the bride because she's
[17:41] got thus sayith the Lord she's got the
[17:42] word of God hallelujah and she's got uh
[17:45] that's right she's got gold Tried by the
[17:47] fire amen hallelujah praise God Amen
[17:50] fire tried Faith by God's grace Time
[17:52] tested faith brother ra says one will be
[17:54] in the field working daytime the other
[17:56] one in a bed sleeping and the other one
[17:58] on the other side side of the world
[17:59] it'll be a universal Rapture and will
[18:01] come with a shout with the voice voice
[18:03] of the arch Archangel and the Trump of
[18:05] God shall sound and the dead in Christ
[18:06] shall rise and she'll be called away
[18:08] secretly oh I love that that great
[18:10] bridegroom coming and the bride got
[18:12] herself ready waiting for that secret
[18:13] moment that she doesn't even know
[18:15] herself but she's ready and dressed and
[18:18] waiting for
[18:19] it so this is the only other verse right
[18:23] he says clap of thunder in 60 uh 65 but
[18:27] we don't know he doesn't give us a verse
[18:30] he says uh and then he said a Corporal
[18:31] body doesn't give a verse just just
[18:34] mentions it okay so the most thorough
[18:36] that I can find I could I'm open open to
[18:38] be correcting um I'm open to be
[18:40] corrected but the the the deepest
[18:42] teaching I've seen on it is in this
[18:44] Rapture sermon 1965 so I lean towards
[18:47] that teaching uh brother R gave us in
[18:50] the Rapture but I also admit it wasn't
[18:52] spoken with thus sayeth the Lord okay
[18:55] now I'm going to get back to this in
[18:57] just a moment but brother Ram says this
[18:58] he said says uh right after this he says
[19:02] we're right there ready now the only
[19:04] thing the church coming out has got to
[19:06] lay before the sun to ripen the great
[19:09] combine will come by after a while the
[19:11] wheat will be burned the stalks but the
[19:13] grain will be gathered into its Garner
[19:15] see you're not blind people you're
[19:17] sensible people so brother ra says
[19:20] anyone with spiritual eyes will know uh
[19:22] the combine is coming it's Harvest Time
[19:25] amen hallelujah if you got eyes that can
[19:27] see if you rub on the iav you'll see
[19:29] it's Rapture time Church can't you see
[19:32] both seeds are making themselves
[19:34] ready we can see the left insane woke
[19:37] seeds they asked me what woke was we can
[19:40] see that's them coming to the fruition
[19:43] of their their seed the seed is
[19:45] producing of its own kind but we must
[19:47] not be in despair because we know our
[19:49] seed is producing of Our Own Kind it's
[19:51] the word kind Hallelujah I've got a word
[19:54] seed I only believe the word I'm a Child
[19:56] of God I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I
[19:58] love Jes Jesus I given my whole life
[20:00] I've surrendered everything to him I've
[20:01] got a word seed Hallelujah that's what
[20:04] you've got amen
[20:06] hallelujah now I just want to just think
[20:09] about this there's numerous quotes
[20:10] brother R says we just got to lay in the
[20:12] presence of the sun now what does that
[20:14] mean what is the presence of God the
[20:15] presence of God is God's spirit Among Us
[20:19] right and David said in his presence is
[20:22] fullness of joy Psalm 16 put it up there
[20:25] hun psalm
[20:26] 16 so if these message people don't have
[20:29] joy then they're not laying in the
[20:31] presence of the
[20:32] Son and the church said all right 16 all
[20:36] right now I got to skip down I didn't
[20:38] pull it up there I just that actually
[20:39] just came to me i' forgotten about that
[20:42] verse psalm
[20:44] 16 in his presence is fullness of joy
[20:51] yes verse 11 thou will show me the path
[20:54] of Life how many believe he'll do that
[20:55] for
[20:56] you especially young people uh where
[20:58] where do I go with my life Malachi is
[20:59] asking that Lydia is asking where do I
[21:01] go with my life he'll show it to you
[21:03] Hallelujah he showed me where to go I to
[21:06] get that full scholarship because I was
[21:07] poor and couldn't afford College he
[21:09] showed me where to go it's very plain to
[21:11] see where to go
[21:12] right he'll show you the way to go you
[21:15] just got to listen for him right brother
[21:17] Mercy he'll show you to come to akaran
[21:19] right now I hope you stay
[21:21] brother we love to have you stay but
[21:23] God's going to show him his path of life
[21:26] right that W show me the path of life in
[21:29] thy presence is fullness of joy at thy
[21:32] right hand there are Pleasures forever
[21:35] more it is a pleasure to be a Christian
[21:38] it's joyful it's pleasurable to be a
[21:40] message believer Hallelujah if not it's
[21:42] time to start fighting Hallelujah get
[21:44] your joy back because we all know at
[21:46] some point you were Joyful We had power
[21:48] we had joy we had Victory just get it
[21:50] back let's fight the good fight of Faith
[21:52] tonight Hallelujah you can get it back
[21:54] Hallelujah I've got it back
[21:56] Hallelujah the best place to get it is
[21:58] in prayer closet amen or somewhere here
[22:00] at the altar somewhere you know just
[22:02] just a little talk with Jesus makes
[22:03] everything
[22:04] right see so if we're laying in the
[22:07] presence of the sun then we'll have
[22:09] Pleasures in the presence of the Holy
[22:10] Ghost we'll have joy in the presence of
[22:12] the Holy Ghost these are all things that
[22:14] we have while we're laying in the
[22:15] presence of the
[22:16] sun now I just want to show you and I
[22:18] looked up on the internet now this is
[22:20] chat GTP so bear with me here but I
[22:22] asked in Israel how long is the each
[22:24] stage of the growth for the wheat plant
[22:27] so it looks like a pretty good article
[22:28] it's got a citation it normally uh is
[22:31] grown as a winter crop and they align
[22:34] with the Mediterranean climate's
[22:35] rainfall but the first seven to 14 days
[22:38] is germination and when the uh the
[22:41] little plant emerges the next two or
[22:43] three weeks is tillering it's from
[22:46] December to January the plant develops
[22:48] additional
[22:49] choots and then the next four to six
[22:52] weeks is stem elongation from January to
[22:55] February the wheat plant begins to grow
[22:57] taller as a stem elongates leading to
[22:59] the formation of nodes growth depends on
[23:02] temperature and nutrient availability
[23:04] then for the next two or 3 weeks in
[23:06] February or March the head starts to
[23:09] develop and emerges from the leaf sheath
[23:11] proper moisture and W mild temperatures
[23:14] support this stage and then the
[23:16] flowering stage is in the next one to
[23:18] two weeks in March and April pollination
[23:20] occurs the plant is highly sensitive to
[23:22] heat and drought stress during this
[23:25] stage how many want to be sensitive to
[23:27] the heat of the Holy Spirit
[23:29] hallelujah praise God but how many know
[23:31] there's cold Seasons
[23:33] too so what's going to get us through
[23:35] stay planted in Christ Hallelujah stay
[23:38] planted in Christ brother R says when
[23:40] the winds blow you know sence says it
[23:41] too when the winds blow your roots just
[23:43] go deeper Hallelujah when the Trials
[23:45] come you just get more faith Hallelujah
[23:48] for the next trial Hallelujah there's
[23:50] going to be some cold spells but you'll
[23:52] get through the season God works
[23:54] everything out in his own time
[23:55] Hallelujah he makes all things beautiful
[23:58] in his
[24:00] time so after grain
[24:03] filling no next is grain filling uh from
[24:06] April to May four to six weeks this is
[24:09] the plant shifts in resources to filling
[24:11] the grains warm days and cool nights
[24:14] promote good grain development now you
[24:17] can see the wheat grain at this time but
[24:19] here's what I've read other places if
[24:21] you pick it off and you pinch it milk
[24:23] comes
[24:24] out right which means it's not hard
[24:27] enough it's kind of
[24:29] weak right it's a little
[24:32] wimpy it's a baby it cries a little bit
[24:36] it's got its baby milk out right it's
[24:38] got It's a baby it's not mature and see
[24:41] church when we get pinched we can't cry
[24:42] too much about
[24:44] it I mean complain I mean sin I'm not
[24:47] talking about I do cry when when when
[24:49] tough times come I'll cry but I'm not
[24:52] talk I'm not talking about those kind of
[24:53] Tears I'm talking about complaining
[24:55] tears and sinful Tears like fighting
[24:57] somebody back or uh trying to get
[24:59] revenge on somebody that's what I'm
[25:01] talking about it's
[25:03] immaturity but it's still the it's still
[25:06] a seed now of course in the natural if
[25:08] you if you crack it like that you've
[25:10] ruined it right but that that proves to
[25:13] us that God's protected us and he won't
[25:14] let the devil crack us hallelujah
[25:17] because I just said it's harvest time I
[25:20] just said it's time for the seeds to
[25:22] mature
[25:23] Hallelujah that's right glory to God and
[25:26] then after that four to six weeks is the
[25:28] ripening stage it's actually the last
[25:30] stage and this is what brother man was
[25:32] talking about it's only two to four
[25:34] weeks it's two weeks to a month it's
[25:36] from May to June the grains mature and
[25:39] Harden as the plant dries out Farmers
[25:41] prepare for Harvest during this
[25:44] time so it just gets hard and church let
[25:47] me just say like this it just becomes
[25:49] solid amen right it becomes hard and and
[25:52] you you couldn't you couldn't squeeze it
[25:55] and and milk would come out you're a
[25:56] solid Christian
[25:58] you're a mature Christian that's the
[26:00] kind God's going to Rapture Hallelujah
[26:03] brother had been through many storms and
[26:05] many Trials of Life many difficult times
[26:07] but by the end of his life he was a
[26:08] hardened Soldier he was solid and I I
[26:11] always love what he said about brother
[26:12] Neville brother brother Neville's the
[26:13] same every day same brother Neville day
[26:15] in day out that's what he not only uh I
[26:17] he said I don't only like his preaching
[26:19] I like that he lives his
[26:21] preaching same every day what he's hard
[26:23] he's he's solid he's a real mature
[26:25] believer God help us to live the same
[26:27] every day Hallelujah
[26:29] be mature ripen
[26:30] Hallelujah so lay in the presence of the
[26:33] Sun the joy the pleasures of the Lord
[26:36] lay brother it's time to lay in the
[26:38] presence of the son and then last stage
[26:41] eighth stage oh eight is eternity amen
[26:44] eight stage is Harvest Time from late
[26:46] May to early June once the grain reaches
[26:49] full maturity the crop is harvested so
[26:51] the total growth cycle lasts about five
[26:53] to seven months seven months oh I like
[26:55] that seven Church ages seven depending
[26:59] on environmental conditions and the
[27:00] wheat
[27:01] variety glory to God
[27:03] hallelujah now I'm going to read a few
[27:06] more here before I show some visuals
[27:10] here next in this sermon brother Ram
[27:13] says his message was to open the Seven
[27:16] Seals all those
[27:19] Mysteries brother ra said and if I stood
[27:21] here and said those things for prejudice
[27:23] question mark I say it because it's life
[27:26] because I'm responsible to God for
[27:27] saying it I'm must say it and my message
[27:30] all the time knowing back there under
[27:31] healing so he talking about his first
[27:32] poll and second poll back there under
[27:34] healing and so forth that was just to
[27:36] catch the people's attention knowing the
[27:39] message would come and here it is and
[27:42] them Seven Seals open those Mysteries
[27:45] and showing these things is what's
[27:47] happened I didn't know it now church I
[27:50] don't know what caught you but what
[27:51] caught me was actually the Mysteries
[27:53] what caught me so some people when they
[27:56] hear Brother R they'll just hear us t
[27:58] and they'll see him on YouTube and he'll
[27:59] be Discerning there and people see that
[28:01] that's the that's the first and second
[28:04] poll and that will catch people they
[28:06] like oh my this guy knows Secrets Benny
[28:07] Hinn even says I mean all these guys
[28:10] Kenneth copelan and Bill Johnson they
[28:12] these guys are all Heretics but they all
[28:13] can recognize brother had a gift of God
[28:15] they can all enjoy the healing but what
[28:18] do they miss they miss the third poll
[28:20] the opening of the word hallelujah what
[28:22] caught our attention the Mysteries the
[28:24] third poll marriage and divorce serpent
[28:26] seed the godhead waterb baptism amen all
[28:29] these great truths brother said that's
[28:31] what the first two polls were to do get
[28:33] the people's attention so they'll look
[28:35] to the third pole they'll look to the
[28:37] opening of the
[28:38] word hallelujah he said the opening of
[28:41] these Seven Seals and again the Seven
[28:43] Seals it unmasks God's anointing
[28:45] remember there four anointings on the
[28:47] church it it it reveals those but it
[28:49] also unmasks Satan's four horse riders
[28:53] so that we can overcome the Gates of
[28:55] Hell Hallelujah
[28:58] now look what brother says I might have
[29:00] read this before and forgive me if this
[29:01] is a repeat I didn't think this was a
[29:02] repeat but if it was forgive me he says
[29:05] ' but there's men standing here now was
[29:06] standing right with me when all you
[29:08] heard me preach that sermon s what time
[29:10] is it now you remember that from a few
[29:12] months ago it's okay if you don't
[29:13] brother R also called this verse you
[29:15] remember the other name he gave this uh
[29:17] for this sermon the seven
[29:20] Thunders that was it was a sermon he
[29:23] preached about the vision he had about
[29:25] going out west meeting the seven angels
[29:28] in a in a snow white pyramid remember
[29:30] that he had a he had a vision about that
[29:32] in late 1962 he told the church about it
[29:34] December 30th I think think was 1962 he
[29:37] said in the name of the Lord something's
[29:39] going to happen and then he goes out
[29:40] there two months later and experiences
[29:42] the cloud it was a
[29:44] prophecy and he says there's men
[29:46] standing here now that was with me then
[29:49] when all you heard me preach that sermon
[29:51] what time is it sir that morning exactly
[29:53] where it said it would be there stood
[29:55] Seven Angels standing right there from
[29:56] heaven and as they went up the the
[29:58] Whirlwind taking them up there we were
[30:00] standing watching as they went away
[30:02] science took a picture of it so now he
[30:04] ties back in that cloud picture with his
[30:07] ministry the shout hallelujah right
[30:10] that's God vindicating Revelation
[30:12] chapter 10 God coming down and giving an
[30:15] open book to Brother brandom The Seven
[30:17] Seals have been revealed Hallelujah
[30:20] they've been revealed the Mysteries have
[30:21] been finished the Bible's a new Bible
[30:23] amen hallelujah it's a brand new Bible
[30:26] Hallelujah because we have the
[30:26] revelations Hallelujah
[30:28] and brother's backing that up he's
[30:30] saying I'm just not saying that there's
[30:31] men that were there that that saw it as
[30:33] well and I told you about it before it
[30:35] happened in the name of the
[30:37] Lord
[30:40] hallelujah all
[30:42] right let me go a little further here by
[30:44] God's grace I got plenty of
[30:49] time now the next story he gives I'm
[30:51] just going to do a few more stories
[30:52] before I get to these final visuals here
[30:55] um brother Bram tells a story about that
[30:57] CL oh yeah talking about the cloud there
[30:59] that we had the picture of that I showed
[31:01] you a couple weeks ago and he said he
[31:03] asked Jack Moore Jack Moore um he says
[31:07] uh why why did Jesus have white hair in
[31:09] Revelation chapter 1 he said that always
[31:12] puzzled him and because he's connecting
[31:14] that white cloud remember the holy
[31:15] spirit said turn the picture right and
[31:18] then brother could see oh that's the
[31:19] head of Christ right brother said that's
[31:21] Christ looking down at
[31:24] us but he said I always wonder why do he
[31:26] have the white hair and uh Jack Moore
[31:29] told him oh that's Jesus's glorified
[31:30] body and brother said that didn't ring
[31:32] the bell he said then I went to prayer
[31:34] and God showed me that white represents
[31:37] not just the glorified body it
[31:38] represents deity that Jesus is the
[31:42] Supreme judge he's Lord God Almighty
[31:45] he's he who was he who is and he who is
[31:48] to come Hallelujah he's all of it amen
[31:51] he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[31:52] and the end he's all of God hallelujah
[31:55] the fullness of the godhead dwelt in
[31:57] Christ bodily now I want to say this I
[32:00] believe that white hair does represent
[32:02] the glorified body now people might
[32:04] think I'm crazy for that they can think
[32:05] whatever they want but Church there's
[32:07] only three bodies there's only a a
[32:08] there's only a natural body a theophany
[32:10] and a glorified so which one is which
[32:13] one is Jesus in right now he's got to be
[32:15] in the glorified he's got to be in the
[32:17] glorified because he rose with that body
[32:20] right and then he that that glorified
[32:22] body uh was walking there after the
[32:24] resurrection it walked through walls it
[32:26] could disappear it could change it form
[32:28] it has to be the glorified body but
[32:31] brother said that didn't ring a bell
[32:32] because there was more truth to that yes
[32:34] it's the glorified body but also it's
[32:37] God in Christ reconciling the world to
[32:39] himself all of God was in Christ
[32:41] hallelujah amen all power and authority
[32:44] is given unto me okay so some people
[32:47] disagree with me on that too that's fine
[32:49] they can do whatever they want but
[32:50] there's only three bodies you show me
[32:51] where there's four bodies or five bodies
[32:53] or six bodies you show me brother ra
[32:56] tells us and who is this mezic there's
[32:58] only three bodies so if you don't
[33:00] believe there's the glorified body
[33:02] you're going against brother random in
[33:03] other places so you got to rightly
[33:05] divide the word of Truth okay so it has
[33:07] to be Jesus in a glorified body but it's
[33:09] the white is referring to Supreme deity
[33:12] Jesus is the judge and the Holy Spirit
[33:15] said go back into the days of the
[33:16] founding fathers what did the judges
[33:18] always wear a white wig so that cloud
[33:21] come down with Jesus with the white wig
[33:22] on showing he's Supreme judge of this
[33:24] Earth Hallelujah he's judge of Heaven
[33:27] judge of Earth
[33:30] Hallelujah and the judge said you're
[33:33] pardoned the judge said you're Justified
[33:36] amen amen hallelujah that's what the
[33:38] judge said he's my Advocate he's also
[33:40] the advocate too he's also the lawyer
[33:42] and the judge Hallelujah he's all of it
[33:45] Hallelujah now then brother R goes into
[33:47] how the bride is Justified as though you
[33:50] never did it at all now our flesh did it
[33:52] our mind did it but the soul that's
[33:54] anointed the anointed Soul did not do
[33:57] any sin
[33:58] because that anointing is the Holy
[34:00] Ghost is that right but your body's
[34:03] guilty your mind's guilty that's totally
[34:05] guilty those parts of you did Sin but
[34:09] the soul uh but but the soul that's born
[34:11] again cannot sin because it's the seed
[34:14] of God hallelujah I think it's first
[34:17] John 4:9 case you want to pull that up
[34:19] there I ought to have that one memorized
[34:21] by now shame on me if I don't first John
[34:24] is it
[34:25] 49 no 48

[35:21] you thanks for your patience Saints
[35:23] whosoever is born of God doth not commit
[35:25] sin this is what brother's talking about
[35:26] you never sin in the first place well
[35:28] what what part of you my flesh sins all
[35:31] the time my mind sins all the time every
[35:33] day brother Bram says I sin for his seed
[35:36] remains in him he cannot sin because
[35:38] he's born of God hallelujah the bride is
[35:41] born of God so the part that's born
[35:43] again is the soul the soul cannot sin it
[35:46] never did sin because it's part of God's
[35:49] spirit Hallelujah all right there you go
[35:52] he said
[35:55] uh the bride is married married to The
[35:58] Virtuous Son of God the sinless Son of
[36:00] God brother Bram says we're married so
[36:02] we have to have a part of us that never
[36:04] sin in the first place if we're to be
[36:06] married to the sinless one right we have
[36:09] to have that part that's his own life
[36:13] okay all right and then now brother BR
[36:15] breaks into this part we'll see I'm
[36:17] almost here to this part of showing the
[36:18] visuals brother said then we see we see
[36:21] the Rapture in types he said for every
[36:23] type we need two or three Witnesses he
[36:25] says he says there's already been three
[36:28] Old Testament raptures Enoch Elijah and
[36:30] Jesus alone there's already been three
[36:33] so he said that's three
[36:34] Witnesses then he says there's three new
[36:36] testament raptures one's already passed
[36:39] that was Jesus when he led captivity
[36:41] captive
[36:43] Hallelujah and then the second one he
[36:45] says is this bride the Gentile bride's
[36:48] Rapture that's the one we're living for
[36:53] Hallelujah and then the third one will
[36:55] be the two witnesses of Revelation
[36:58] probably Moses and Elijah or two men
[37:00] Anointed with their Spirits I personally
[37:03] believe it'll be Moses and
[37:06] Elijah but I could be
[37:08] wrong okay
[37:11] now I'm G to keep going here um next
[37:14] brother random goes into uh reading
[37:18] first Thessalonians four uh four again
[37:21] he talks about the three or the six
[37:22] raptures and then he breaks he's almost
[37:24] done he breaks into the armis day parade
[37:27] which was the Veterans Day Parade that's
[37:29] the old term for it Armistice Armistice
[37:32] Day parade and brother bam says he he
[37:35] watched him and Joseph watched the
[37:37] parade and they started with the the
[37:39] oldest war and then they worked their up
[37:41] to the most modern war right the most
[37:42] recent
[37:44] war and uh brother R said the last one
[37:46] was was gold star mothers that have lost
[37:49] their sons and and gold star wives have
[37:52] lost their husbands and a little boy who
[37:53] lost his daddy in the war and brother B
[37:55] said that's so sad he he said but one
[37:58] day there's going to be a blast and the
[38:00] dead in Christ will rise first so he's
[38:03] talking about the voice he's talking
[38:04] about the Second Step the voice of the
[38:06] Archangel the shout is getting everybody
[38:09] ready and now he's talking about one day
[38:11] there's a blast and the dead in Christ
[38:13] that that that dead soldier if he was a
[38:15] holy ghost filled Saint he'll rise when
[38:17] the voice of the Archangel sounds it's
[38:19] Christ
[38:21] Hallelujah he said he does all these as
[38:23] he's
[38:25] descending then brother R said see then
[38:27] we'll drop right in line brother R said
[38:29] the dead in Christ go first he said and
[38:32] then we'll go to meet them in the air in
[38:34] our order and remember there's an order
[38:37] for the Rapture we're not going to look
[38:38] at it but it's 1 Corinthians 15 I'll
[38:39] eventually get to it when I get to my
[38:41] series on Corinthians there's an order
[38:43] just like in the parade brother Braham
[38:45] saw the parade there was the order it
[38:47] was the oldest maybe the Civil War I
[38:48] don't know if there was any Civil War
[38:49] people alive in that time in
[38:51] 1965 the Civil War people and then any
[38:54] other Wars and then the World War II
[38:58] right that was the most recent War they
[39:00] they were they were uh presented in
[39:03] their order and brother says so is the
[39:05] rapture it'll be in its order Jesus with
[39:08] the uh Jesus with the Saints was first
[39:10] the bride will be second right and then
[39:12] Moses and elij third right in the order
[39:15] for six raptures
[39:18] Hallelujah then brother Ram says it the
[39:20] Rapture has been spoken it must come to
[39:23] pass he said just like when Moses was
[39:26] requested to speak for God as a prophet
[39:29] of God whatever God said to Moses it
[39:32] came to pass he said like Isaiah said a
[39:35] virgin shall conceive and she did it
[39:38] came to pass whatever God says will come
[39:40] to pass if the shout voice Trump is in
[39:42] the Bible it will come to pass oh
[39:44] there's going to be some people imagine
[39:46] some people will not have to have a
[39:48] funeral Hallelujah there's going to be
[39:50] some people they don't got to pay
[39:52] insurance money for the casket cuz
[39:53] they're not going to have a casket
[39:55] hallelujah amen they're going to have
[39:57] Angels they're going to have a brand new
[39:58] body pack them to a meeting in the air
[40:01] it's been spoken someone's going to
[40:03] manifest that just as sure as all these
[40:06] other prophecies came to pass someone is
[40:08] going to fulfill the shout voice and
[40:11] Trump that's the point brother BRS
[40:13] making just as Jesus called for Lazarus
[40:16] as resurrection and Lazarus came forth
[40:19] uh Jesus also said uh he said one day
[40:23] all those that are in the graves will
[40:25] hear the voice of the son of man and
[40:27] come forth to the Judgment it's going to
[40:30] happen Hallelujah each and every person
[40:33] that's ever lived is going to come to
[40:35] judgment they heal the voice of Christ
[40:37] think about that all these Napoleon and
[40:39] all these Great Men even George
[40:41] Washington all these great men and these
[40:42] evil men like Hitler melini and S
[40:44] they're all going to hear the voice of
[40:46] Jesus Christ calling them for judgment
[40:49] Hallelujah that's the P that's how
[40:51] powerful the voice of Christ is
[40:53] hallelujah oh but when the Savior calls
[40:55] let me answer for the rapture Hallelujah
[40:58] I want to hear his voice before the
[40:59] white Throne judgment I want to hear his
[41:01] voice at the meeting in the air praise
[41:03] God grant it
[41:08] Lord and then brother random in this
[41:10] sermon I don't know if you knew this he
[41:11] repeats his last prophecy about Los
[41:14] Angeles he said thus sayith the Lord Los
[41:16] Angeles will fall in the
[41:18] ocean he said it will he repeats it one
[41:21] more
[41:22] time he said just as sure as the Holy
[41:25] Spirit told me judgment is going to
[41:26] strike the West Coast and two days later
[41:29] alas Parts of Alaska broke apart and
[41:31] almost sunk brother Ram says I've got
[41:33] video I've got magazines of it in there
[41:34] it was it was a huge earthquake brother
[41:37] Ram said thus say the Lord judgment is
[41:38] going to strike the west coast and
[41:39] Alaska had this massive earthquake in
[41:42] 1964 he said the same voice that told me
[41:44] judgment was strike the same voice said
[41:46] Los Angeles is going to
[41:48] sink thus sayith the Lord now we don't
[41:51] know when I believe it be after the
[41:52] Rapture because I I don't see how that
[41:54] could be before the Rapture the Bible
[41:56] speaks of great earthquake I mentioned
[41:57] that a few months ago in Revelation all
[42:00] of them happen either during the
[42:01] trumpets or the
[42:03] vows it speaks of the the earthquake
[42:05] that will never be like it ever again I
[42:08] believe that it'll be that one
[42:11] Hallelujah and then he says
[42:17] uh okay yeah I'm gonna wait I'm gonna
[42:19] hold that for next
[42:21] time now I'm going to switch to some
[42:23] visuals here and I'm just going to try
[42:24] to finish up I'm GNA try to not preach
[42:25] hour I'm GNA try not to preach hour
[42:28] because I've been preaching and singing
[42:29] a lot and I'm really tired at home okay
[42:30] let's switch over here doesn't look like
[42:33] I'm tired but at home I'm a different
[42:39] Man Okay so let's do a few visuals here
[42:41] as we finish up by God's how many
[42:42] enjoying this Rapture series I've
[42:45] thoroughly enjoyed it I've really
[42:46] enjoyed it by God's grace it's good to
[42:47] revisit these things and see all the um
[42:51] the thoughts brother Ram put into this
[42:52] one sermon even being rushed so if you
[42:55] never seen brother Ram's handwriting or
[42:57] notes you're going in for a treat
[42:58] tonight I've seen them years I just I
[43:00] never thought about showing you guys so
[43:01] it kind of worked out or you Saints I
[43:03] shouldn't say guys you
[43:05] Saints it's been a long
[43:07] day so um here's brother Man's first few
[43:11] pages the Rapture Psalm that was his
[43:13] text Psalm 27 1-5 this is a new sermon
[43:15] he never preached this before on the
[43:17] shout voice
[43:19] Trump we are warned that the
[43:22] doctoring doctoring Doctrine will be
[43:25] scorned in the last days days 2 Peter
[43:28] 334 read that's his reminder read that
[43:31] he did remember he did like 30 minutes
[43:33] on scoffers I preach that to you guys
[43:36] you Saints
[43:37] sorry Lord have
[43:39] mercy but it is the revelation of his
[43:42] bride Church bread Church see how just a
[43:46] shorthand and then the section is on
[43:48] Revelation right so think about that
[43:49] he's preaching from the from memory he's
[43:51] basically like they say shooting from
[43:52] the hip these are his notes so brother
[43:55] in some people criticize his memory well
[43:57] he criticizes his memory like who
[43:59] doesn't have a bad
[44:00] memory who remembers everything in their
[44:02] life to me brother had a great
[44:05] memory yeah he remembered Mo I mean he's
[44:08] quoting scripture all throughout this
[44:09] sermon I the Lord of planted I water day
[44:12] and night Hallelujah he quotes that now
[44:14] he doesn't have in his notes
[44:15] here but he was he had a great memory
[44:18] when the spirit of God anointed him the
[44:19] Holy Spirit brought all things to his
[44:21] remembrance that was needed
[44:24] Hallelujah so we had a section on the
[44:26] first section was scorn uh scorners
[44:29] Revelation without rev Revelation there
[44:32] cannot be Faith that's beautiful he just
[44:35] got done preaching works as Faith
[44:37] Express and in that he says you can try
[44:39] to confess your healing all day long but
[44:41] you're not going to get it till God
[44:42] gives you the Revelation for it it's
[44:45] good to confess your healing it's good
[44:46] to confess any promise of God but it's
[44:48] not going to happen until you have a
[44:49] revelation it's God's will it's going to
[44:51] happen so look he had that in his notes
[44:54] you can't have faith unless there's a
[44:56] revelation about it and a revelation is
[44:59] an unveiling you can't believe something
[45:01] or or have hope for something unless
[45:03] God's revealed it to
[45:05] you and then he quotes that for faith is
[45:09] something that has been revealed to you
[45:11] like Abraham and that's what I preached
[45:13] to you a few weeks ago when I read that
[45:15] Abraham called those things not as
[45:17] though they were because God let him
[45:19] know you're going to have a child he
[45:21] knew it it was it was revealed to him he
[45:24] didn't have to question him brother
[45:25] Mercy he knew it now most of have to
[45:27] question are we going to live until the
[45:28] Rapture happens or not we have to
[45:30] question unless God gives us a thus
[45:32] sayith the Lord but if You' got to thus
[45:34] sayith the Lord you can be just like
[45:37] Abraham right I'm going to get a body
[45:39] changed I'm not going to die thus sayith
[45:40] the Lord now that's a statement I don't
[45:43] have that Revelation some people claim
[45:45] to have it but they don't say thus
[45:46] sayith the lord they're just boasting
[45:48] they're just presuming and the church
[45:50] said they're just presuming if you have
[45:52] a thus sayith the Lord Brother man if I
[45:54] had thus sayth the Lord I I wouldn't be
[45:56] afraid to announce it before the whole
[45:58] world because you know God told you
[46:00] hallelujah
[46:02] amen like Abraham Abraham could call
[46:05] those things not as though they were
[46:06] because God said you're going to have a
[46:08] son through
[46:10] Sarah now the Rapture is only for the
[46:12] bride
[46:14] Church the elected ones in him remember
[46:16] that's that section on Election he talks
[46:18] about um the germs and the egg right you
[46:21] talked about one at a million you know
[46:23] we talked about election how how that's
[46:25] mysterious that's more mysterious than
[46:26] the virgin birth right but it's it's
[46:29] predestination it's
[46:30] election and from the beginning father
[46:33] spiritual look he said jeans but he says
[46:37] Janes instead of attributes it's
[46:41] attributes that's his shorthand so don't
[46:44] feel bad if you're not a good speller
[46:46] prophet of God wasn't the perfect
[46:48] speller I try to do my best so see
[46:52] election uh you're a spiritual Gene
[46:54] you're an attribute you're an attribute
[46:57] you from God's mind
[47:00] Hallelujah now how do we get in him I
[47:04] read this to you or come alive to it
[47:06] come alive to the fact we're an
[47:07] attribute we're elected we're only for
[47:08] the Rapture remember uh 1 Corinthians 12
[47:12] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[47:14] one body Hallelujah brother uses this
[47:16] verse hundreds of times how do I go make
[47:19] sure I'm in the Rapture how do I know
[47:21] I'm GNA I'm the bride of Christ you get
[47:23] Born Again by the Holy Spirit praise God
[47:25] Amen you get baptized into the body of
[47:29] Christ and so this point he's already
[47:32] preached almost 50 minutes just with
[47:34] just with this with a page and and three
[47:36] quarters he's already preached 50
[47:38] minutes now that's totally different
[47:40] from me right I'll show you my notes
[47:43] here's my notes for
[47:46] tonight I got to have a lot more notes
[47:48] than brother brandom these are all my
[47:50] notes for
[47:52] tonight brother Bram just had a few
[47:54] pages my wife laughing at me
[47:59] there's only been one time I've ever
[48:00] preached a sermon where I didn't have
[48:01] look at my notes that was in Guyana
[48:03] that's that's the day God healed that
[48:04] woman from
[48:06] uh kidney
[48:08] stone she had she was packing the baby
[48:10] there that was just a highly anointed
[48:13] service there then he breaks into Enoch
[48:16] Enoch was the seven type this is where
[48:17] he goes in the types of the
[48:19] Rapture the other six all
[48:23] died so the six men before Enoch all
[48:26] died right Adam all the way down Enoch
[48:31] lived okay how many like those
[48:34] notes well he wasn't really a scholar
[48:37] like some people huh but he didn't have
[48:39] to be he had to be a prophet of God and
[48:41] he was but thus sayith the Lord nobody
[48:43] ever spoke like
[48:45] that except it was another prophet of
[48:48] God okay now here's where we get into it
[48:50] now this this a little crooked here
[48:51] sometimes I wonder I know we got to let
[48:53] Mali see the word sometimes
[48:56] now look here's where he breaks into it
[48:58] he said this is new a
[49:00] shout a voice a trumpet Christ does all
[49:04] three as he descends so that's why some
[49:06] people believe you know Christ's spirit
[49:08] is more powerful now because the Bible
[49:11] said he does it as he's descending which
[49:14] I could I could say Amen to that we have
[49:15] more holy ghosts than Martin Luther had
[49:17] am than John Wesley than isusa street we
[49:21] have more right but we have a certain
[49:23] character about us there's a certain
[49:26] anointing we have the eagle anointing
[49:28] right they each had their own anointing
[49:30] now those three all had the man
[49:31] anointing but we've got the eagle
[49:32] anointing prophetic we know the we know
[49:35] the word of God the Revelation finish
[49:38] the mysteries of
[49:39] God and now look he says shout a message
[49:42] getting the living ready
[49:46] Mal Malachi 4 there's Malachi right
[49:48] there so Malachi spelled your name m a l
[49:50] Ki
[49:51] Malachi Malachi 4 Lamp
[49:54] trimming I love this because this shows
[49:57] me he was preaching from his heart he
[49:58] was preaching just as best he could by
[50:01] Revelation he's a prophet of God doing
[50:03] his best look at the prophet's notes I
[50:05] love
[50:06] it you remember this brother Mercy you
[50:08] remember have you seen these before yeah
[50:11] I only saw them there uh you know at the
[50:13] voice of God and this is all the things
[50:15] I've just preached to you seven sermons
[50:17] Worth right voice of
[50:21] resurrect the same one that called
[50:24] Lazareth from the dead St John 11
[50:29] 38-44 okay so you'll shout voice trumpet
[50:33] assembling the bride gather
[50:36] to at Feast of trumpet or
[50:42] or or maybe air I'm not sure I'm not
[50:44] sure okay so these are all things I've
[50:47] preached right right right from his
[50:48] sermon notes right right from the sermon
[50:50] uh transcript then after his
[50:53] resurrection rapture
[50:57] there has been one already passed in the
[51:00] New Testament so now he breaks into how
[51:01] there was three Old Testament three new
[51:03] testament there's been one already in
[51:04] the past that was Jesus and he said read
[51:07] that and he does read that he reads
[51:09] through that on the on the
[51:10] sermon uh when Jesus led captivity
[51:13] captive the the Old Testament Saints he
[51:14] led them up to heaven then then notice
[51:17] verse 50 his loud voice awakened the Old
[51:20] Testament Saints like it did Lazarus so
[51:22] again when the Rapture comes church only
[51:25] the elect are going to hear the voice of
[51:27] God only those elect are going to hear
[51:29] the voice and have their bodies change
[51:31] to go to meet the lord and there that's
[51:33] why we got to have that's why we have to
[51:34] recognize the voice of God right now
[51:36] praise God the voice of God is Not
[51:38] denomination thank God the voice of God
[51:40] is not in the government the voice of
[51:41] God is in the bride amen the spirit and
[51:43] the bride say come Hallelujah that's the
[51:46] word now we're humbled I know it must be
[51:48] hard for Lena sometimes it's hard for me
[51:49] to understand too that God would make me
[51:51] part of the voice of the Bride us how us
[51:55] not the government not the big
[51:57] denomination it's the bride those who
[51:59] love the bridegroom Hallelujah the real
[52:01] bridegroom the real word
[52:05] hallelujah what a privilege I mean could
[52:07] could we ask for any greater privilege
[52:08] in life no we this is the greatest
[52:10] privilege we could ask for in life to
[52:12] have thus sayith the Lord on the word of
[52:14] God to be the bride to have the voice of
[52:17] the Holy Spirit the spirit and the bride
[52:19] and the prophet uh say come and whatever
[52:21] they've said has already been said in
[52:22] the word of God hallelujah
[52:27] now the second will fulfill 1
[52:30] Thessalonians 4
[52:32] 12-
[52:35] 18 okay so that's the so we are we are
[52:38] the second Rapture that's what he's
[52:39] talking about we're the second Rapture
[52:40] of the New Testament Jesus and the Old
[52:42] Testament Saints first we're second and
[52:44] then Moses and Elijah third everybody
[52:46] see that trying to show how brother man
[52:49] preached off his notes I thought you
[52:51] like it I like
[52:54] it and this is what we just I preached
[52:56] just tonight it has been spoken it shall
[52:59] come to pass for it is his promised word

[53:14] Bride he was out there and a voice said
[53:16] look there's the bride and the first

[53:44] said oh oh yeah I said the Church of
[53:45] Asia passed he said oh that was an awful
[53:47] group he said but the worst of all was
[53:49] Church of the United States He said a
[53:51] witch was leading them right witchcraft
[53:55] Rebellion is as witchcraft when the
[53:58] churches rebel against the word it's a
[54:01] witchcraft right they don't want to obey

[54:05] to go hide and cry and say all my
[54:07] preaching all these all these
[54:08] evangelists preaching all these years

[54:12] the voice said there's going to come
[54:13] another bride and he took courage
[54:16] Hallelujah and he said he saw he saw uh
[54:19] the bride for the second Rapture us he

[54:32] the end that were getting out of step
[54:33] and he said he said stay in line and
[54:35] that's when he woke up from the
[54:37] vision so it shows some bride members

[54:56] he didn't share that because he ran out
[54:58] of time but he did share this uh instead
[55:00] of no he didn't share that instead of
[55:02] Michelangelo he called it Nicki Angelo's
[55:07] Masterpiece we're molded in him from the
[55:10] big inning big big beginning so the he
[55:14] didn't get to any he he stopped right
[55:15] there because he was pressed out he
[55:16] didn't get to any of those stories but
[55:19] that's what he wanted to share now he
[55:20] says on tape I had eight or 10 more
[55:22] pages so we only have five and I like
[55:26] somebody answer me in the brandom family
[55:28] can I get those other eight
[55:29] pages what do I got to do press play and
[55:33] Obey I won't do
[55:34] it I'm sorry I'm not doing that I'll do
[55:37] things but I won't do that I'll call
[55:40] your brother I'll donate to your church
[55:41] but I won't do
[55:43] that okay all right did I miss yeah I
[55:46] miss okay now I'm gonna close with
[55:49] this because I it was just timely it was
[55:51] just timely now this is totally off the
[55:52] Rapture okay but this is on uh the
[55:55] people that say a brother was emailing
[55:57] me and uh we found some good quotes
[55:59] together this
[56:00] morning and so I just brought I just
[56:02] brought this up because uh the brandom
[56:04] worshippers bring this fear TCT tactic
[56:06] and they say how dare you correct
[56:08] brother brandom now let me give you
[56:09] those examples here where is oh where
[56:12] did I do oh here's the examples even
[56:15] from this sermon there's there's there's
[56:16] three or four examples but these are the
[56:18] easiest one to see Enoch was the seventh
[56:20] from
[56:21] Noah anyone that reads their Bible knows
[56:25] that Noah wasn't born till 70 years
[56:26] after Enoch was
[56:28] raptured Noah was a descendant of Enoch
[56:31] not the other way
[56:34] around oh who are you to correct a
[56:36] prophet of God I'll show you what I'm
[56:38] what the prophet of God said about
[56:40] it brother Brandon prayed that the Holy
[56:43] Ghost would help us to see his mistakes
[56:45] so we could be
[56:47] correct he prayed so we'd see his
[56:51] Corrections Hallelujah and and what does
[56:54] that mean you and I are the answer to
[56:56] brother Ram's
[56:57] prayers Hallelujah I'm the answer you're
[57:00] the answer we're actually people that
[57:01] want the truth right we want the full
[57:04] truth of God we won't worship brother
[57:05] random but we'll pray and say God we
[57:07] know he's a prophet he's Vindicated we
[57:08] have confidence in him he's a human
[57:10] though and God show us the truth of all
[57:12] it which scriptures is he pointing to
[57:14] and we're the bride that wants all the
[57:15] word hallelujah
[57:18] am that's one of
[57:20] them so anyone that says every word is
[57:23] thus say the Lord is a liar they're
[57:25] Anointed with the Spirit of idolatry and
[57:27] a lying spirit and a spirit of Pride and
[57:30] how many other
[57:31] Spirits right because they got Pride
[57:33] they're taking their thoughts above the
[57:34] word of God hallelujah and then he says
[57:37] next the next Rapture takes place in
[57:39] second Thessalonians for the church now
[57:41] somebody open your Bible and show me the
[57:43] Rapture in 2 Thessalonians 4 there's
[57:45] only three chapters in 2
[57:48] Thessalonians oh brother Ram knew there
[57:50] was a another extra chapter there that
[57:53] was secret or mystery no you're just a
[57:55] liar
[57:57] right you're just a lion idolator full
[58:00] of pride and arrogance and
[58:02] fear because you don't have a gift to
[58:04] rightly divide the word of truth
[58:07] hallelujah now those are some harsh
[58:09] words sister but that's the truth I'm
[58:11] saying that because you probably hearing
[58:12] them for the first
[58:14] time but I've said it before these
[58:17] people are just insane they're insane
[58:20] and and how do we know because they
[58:21] don't take the other quotes look at
[58:23] these other quotes how dare we not
[58:25] correct brother random since he prayed
[58:27] and asked God to correct his mistakes in
[58:29] our hearts after we listened to the
[58:31] tapes and I got quotes I wouldn't be
[58:34] preaching if I didn't have quotes Church
[58:36] you know me a little better than that
[58:37] don't you I wouldn't just be saying
[58:39] things for my own thoughts I mean I'll
[58:41] tell you if they're my thoughts this
[58:43] one's So
[58:44] Beautiful Lord Jesus he's praying
[58:46] forgive us of our ways that maybe we
[58:48] fail somewhere maybe to get the message
[58:51] just the way it should be but father I
[58:54] pray that where we have made a mistake
[58:57] so he he didn't say if we made a mistake
[58:59] he said we have made a mistake I pray
[59:02] where we've made a mistake that the
[59:04] great holy spirit will take the words
[59:06] wind them around and fix them into the
[59:09] hearts in the correct
[59:11] way that they might understand that it's
[59:14] preparation time now before the going of
[59:17] the way of the church Hallelujah and if
[59:21] you want even more I got a few more but
[59:23] I'm only going to show two tonight this
[59:25] one's says I mean if you can't see this
[59:27] one you're you're spiritually blind I
[59:29] pray tonight Lord somehow you'll build
[59:31] faith in these people's hearts that
[59:32] every one of them will be delivered all
[59:34] these sick and Afflicted people may be
[59:35] so simple Lord just let us as we try to
[59:37] teach your word let the Holy Spirit take
[59:39] my mistakes Lord huh I thought there's
[59:43] no mistakes on the tape Brother Joseph
[59:46] the tapes say there's mistakes on the
[59:48] tapes and correct them in the hearts of
[59:52] the
[59:53] people and the church saiden
[59:56] how dare you correct brother Ram brother
[59:58] Ram prayed the Holy Ghost would help us
[59:59] to correct it when there's mistakes like
[1:00:02] seventh from Enoch 7th from Noah and 2
[1:00:05] Thessalonians
[1:00:07] 4 so what does this prove all these
[1:00:09] people are liars all these people have
[1:00:10] evil spirits on them all these people
[1:00:12] are immature babies now it's not to prop
[1:00:15] us up but it's to be a reality God help
[1:00:17] us to be true to the word of God and be
[1:00:20] a light to them which we tried to
