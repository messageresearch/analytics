[19:33] [Music]
[19:39] [Music]
[20:50] I'd like to go back to numerology
[20:53] tonight and biblical numerology of
[20:55] course you know I gotta be careful I use
[20:57] that word you know cuz the world uses
[20:59] that word obviously the wrong way we'd
[21:02] like to go to let's go to familiar
[21:05] scripture here let's go to I think
[21:09] Matthew 1 yeah Matthew 1 verse 17 let's
[21:13] start there by God's grace glad to make
[21:15] his sister Wendy before the snow came in
[21:17] now you got to drive through the snow we
[21:21] will pray for you that God will be with
[21:23] you the forecast is only one-inch so
[21:26] hopefully stays that made by God's grace
[21:36] Matthew 1:17 I'll be real honest tonight
[21:39] we're looking at 14 15 16 17 I don't
[21:42] have any clear real revelations on these
[21:45] other than 17 17 seems to be clear so
[21:48] the Lord speaks something to you please
[21:50] share with me in fact it was 17 that
[21:53] brother Aaron shared with me all these
[21:54] 17s I've never heard before so the Bible
[21:58] says you can bring a psalm to church a
[21:59] revelation a doctrine just come bringing
[22:03] something to church so I first said that
[22:07] that was weeks and weeks ago on a
[22:09] Wednesday night after service brother
[22:10] Aaron's like you brother Jesse did you
[22:12] know there's all these 17s I'm like tell
[22:14] me because I wanna know all the biblical
[22:17] numerology I can because you know when
[22:19] you see it you then you'll see that it's
[22:20] Christ because God speaks through
[22:23] numbers praise the Lord so Matthew 1:17
[22:27] 14 seems to connect to generation
[22:30] somehow church I don't quite understand
[22:32] it but 14 seems to be a generational
[22:34] number so let's look at this here
[22:36] tonight here so all the generations from
[22:38] Abraham to David are fourteen
[22:39] generations and from David until the
[22:42] carrying away into Babylon are fourteen
[22:44] generations and from the carrying away
[22:46] into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen
[22:48] generations so three four teens I
[22:51] believe that's 42 often a number not
[22:52] mistaken so interesting they're not as
[22:56] blessings the reading was word maybe
[22:58] seated here so this is part 13 remember
[23:04] 13 give me a good number two as we
[23:07] looked at a few weeks ago let's go
[23:08] through this I do have a slides here
[23:10] Lydia so to make sure I'm not forget
[23:18] anything
[23:18] I did buy more seal books sister honey
[23:20] if you they're out there if you need
[23:21] them by God's grace we able to
[23:23] livestream the first service today okay
[23:24] okay good so you heard that all right
[23:26] thank you all right
[23:31] all right that's okay
[23:34] was that like radio or something like
[23:36] that okay no problem no problem you're
[23:39] fine you know in Lima we use to go to
[23:42] Lima right and every almost every week
[23:44] or every every couple of times a month
[23:46] all the sound things would pop and
[23:48] there'd be this laugh and when I went
[23:51] back and preached two years ago it
[23:52] happened again so there's just all these
[23:55] technological problems but you a great
[23:59] job lady don't be discouraged appreciate
[24:01] all you do back there all right so
[24:03] that's a good part 13 I'm just so happy
[24:05] in the Lord you know after this
[24:06] morning's message I'm just so thankful
[24:07] to be in - to be in the right time and
[24:11] season by God's grace I know I'm in the
[24:13] time and season of the rapture we know
[24:15] that I was gonna preach on that tonight
[24:17] but I think I'll save that for Wednesday
[24:18] night I just kind of felt burdened to
[24:20] get through these numbers I'm almost to
[24:21] the end you know once you get to about
[24:23] you know 40 then it kind of kind of
[24:25] skips to 50 and then kind of goes like
[24:27] that and it's kind of there's big skips
[24:29] between the numbers after that so I'm
[24:31] getting closer to the end of this series
[24:34] but it's been a good series I've been
[24:35] really thankful I really consider this
[24:37] series like a initial partially finished
[24:41] series no matter when I get done because
[24:43] I feel like as we go on and serve the
[24:44] Lord God's gonna go show us some more
[24:46] numbers as we go along and then it'll be
[24:48] more complete the revelation will be
[24:50] more complete if the Lord tarries I
[24:52] really believe that is something God's
[24:54] gonna keep adding to as I go along I
[24:57] just got to make sure when the Holy
[24:58] Spirit opens up a number I go write it
[24:59] down because God's trying to tell us
[25:01] something through the numbers he's
[25:03] trying to reveal something to us so
[25:06] let's just go over this again real
[25:08] quickly one is preeminence unity - as
[25:11] division difference testimony unity as
[25:14] well threes perfection and life for is
[25:19] deliverance double confirmation it's
[25:21] also an earthly number five is Grace
[25:24] laboring grace and redemption six has
[25:28] fallen man and beast it's also anointed
[25:30] man and it's a measurement of time or
[25:35] did I skip past seven I must have
[25:36] skipped past seven well seven we know is
[25:38] completion no I don't know rider than f7
[25:40] on there eight is eternity or the first
[25:43] day again new creation new beginning
[25:44] or abundance 9 is fruit or consummation
[25:48] or closure or judgment 10 is divine
[25:51] order worldliness could be a faithful
[25:53] remnant as well 11 is disorder or the
[25:57] last call what was I looking at oh yeah
[26:00] I forgotten this one there's a I just
[26:03] was reading this one
[26:03] there's 11 times the word overcomers
[26:06] used in revelation 11 why cuz it's the
[26:10] last call there's seven in the church
[26:13] ages and there's four afterwards you
[26:15] know so the first revelation two and
[26:17] three have seven of them he that
[26:18] overcometh he that overcometh you though
[26:20] we're coming so there's 11 last calls
[26:22] for overcomers anybody else would
[26:24] overcome God's saying through the book
[26:26] of Revelation I say right here me last
[26:29] car 12 government rule or worship 13 is
[26:36] rebellion victory slash Revelation
[26:40] I found another 13 - I can't remember
[26:43] what it was now bear with me let me skip
[26:46] ahead I'll go back and find it real
[26:47] quick then I'll come back up I know I
[26:50] want to make sure I lay these in so we
[26:51] got them for the future almost there
[27:03] there it is yeah
[27:04] 13-day so sorry mercy goodness so a
[27:08] stirring the Jews were supposed to be
[27:10] killing on the 13th day of the 12th
[27:11] month so the devil met 13 for a bad
[27:15] number
[27:16] but God turned around and when God
[27:17] delivered him the Bible said on the
[27:19] thirteenth day they made a feasting and
[27:22] gladness so what was meant for rebellion
[27:25] like right it was the evil man wasn't it
[27:28] haman haman's rebellion against the Jews
[27:30] God turned around for good amen I
[27:33] thought you might like that by God's
[27:35] grace amen
[27:36] but what Satan has planned for bad God
[27:39] will turn around - good that's right so
[27:41] I want to make sure I read that one now
[27:42] 14 let's now we're in the 14 15 16 17
[27:45] now I put question marks because I can't
[27:47] understand these seven of course I'm
[27:49] sorry 14 of course is a double of seven
[27:52] seven is completion now the book the
[27:55] book writer but enger' said you know
[27:57] double completion why don't know how
[27:59] something could be doubly complete if
[28:02] it's already completed at seven I don't
[28:04] know so I just I just put a question
[28:06] mark I'm not sure but it definitely does
[28:08] relate to generations as you'll see here
[28:10] in just a moment as we looked at our
[28:11] text now Jacob had to work a double 7
[28:14] for his bride right seven years for Leah
[28:19] he says you fulfill he said you've done
[28:21] this he said now fulfill Rachel's week
[28:24] so that was seven more years so double
[28:28] seven now I've preached in the past that
[28:31] those two do type the the Jew and the
[28:33] Gentile bride I'm not familiar with my
[28:37] notes on that because it's been years
[28:38] and years but that is an interesting
[28:40] type they're 14 Joseph's interpreted
[28:46] Pharaoh's dream that covered a 14-year
[28:48] period so this generation or these these
[28:51] two groups of seven would see seven
[28:54] years of plenty and then seven years of
[28:56] famine 14 and Joseph would be ruling at
[29:00] the beginning and end of that so that's
[29:02] interesting to see a double seven there
[29:09] the lamb was killed on the 14th day so
[29:13] that's striking to of Christ being
[29:15] crucified on the 14 day
[29:18] the third month so 14 there there's 14
[29:22] so it can mean like something like I was
[29:25] trying to look up words like pivot or
[29:27] Junction or something like that there's
[29:29] something with that 14 as we saw in
[29:32] Matthew chapter 1 you know it was from
[29:34] Abraham to David you know there was like
[29:36] a like a change or that was like a
[29:38] completion you know so maybe it is
[29:40] double completion I don't know that's
[29:43] interesting and this morning we saw
[29:45] there's 14 times and seasons that God
[29:49] lists in Ecclesiastes 3 there's not 13
[29:52] there's not 15 there's 14 times and
[29:56] seasons which is striking not sure why
[30:00] 14 seems to be seems to be like it may
[30:03] be a generation you know would go
[30:04] through these things or maybe you and
[30:06] your life you know 40 years also gonna
[30:09] be a generation which is interesting to
[30:10] kind of mixing up the numbers there but
[30:13] you understand 14 seems to be four times
[30:15] and seasons we saw there's three sets of
[30:19] 14 from Abraham to David 14 than from
[30:22] David to carrying away to Babylon so see
[30:25] that kind of marks like changes right
[30:27] or junctions and then from Babylon to
[30:32] Christ fourteen generations so it's
[30:35] really quite striking to me it's
[30:37] mysterious I'll say it like that and so
[30:40] if you guys if anyone gives you a rabbit
[30:42] or God gives you a revelation anybody
[30:43] let me know I'll be happy to to take
[30:46] that revelation there by the grace of
[30:47] Lord but like I said I've never heard a
[30:48] sermon on numerology biblical numerology
[30:50] so I'm just trying to I'm just I feel
[30:53] like I've kind of like an explorer I'm
[30:55] just kind of exploring deeper than then
[30:56] what I've ever heard on it and just
[30:58] trying to go as deep as I can and
[30:59] whatever I find
[31:00] praise the Lord I'll rejoice in that but
[31:03] I believe as we go on God will show us
[31:04] more of these troops the soldiers that
[31:08] Paul was with in the boat fasted for 14
[31:11] days
[31:12] I'm sorry 13 rather and then on the 14th
[31:15] they broke the fast so like a change
[31:17] so maybe 14 is like a change yeah they
[31:22] fasted 13 but the Bible said on the 14th
[31:25] they took some meat Paul told them to
[31:28] take for 14 I'm sorry to take meat on
[31:31] the 14th day
[31:33] there was 14 years between Paul's visits
[31:36] to Jerusalem so right after he was saved
[31:38] born again there was 14 years he went to
[31:42] Arabia for three years right and then he
[31:44] went on his missionary trip I believe it
[31:46] was first missionary trip and he came
[31:48] back after 14 years so that seems like a
[31:51] period of time you know two sevens in
[31:54] there again I can't explain it
[31:56] I can't let nail it down like I can nail
[31:58] down a three I can down to seven I can
[32:01] nail down a ten that's that's divine
[32:02] order but this one I just can't quite
[32:04] nail down I can't quite see the pattern
[32:06] here let's go to 15 as you can tell this
[32:11] probably won't be a very long sermon but
[32:13] I want to lay it out there by the grace
[32:15] of God so 15 it could mean again
[32:18] question marks could mean a triple five
[32:22] five is grace but again triple grace I
[32:24] mean that's the number I hadn't won my
[32:25] my band got fixed for free five five
[32:28] five I don't know I don't know I'm just
[32:31] looking for an um you know thankful just
[32:32] thankful for God's grace but does
[32:35] certainly relate to the feasts which is
[32:37] interesting we'll see a couple of those
[32:40] feasts unleavened bread and Tabernacles
[32:43] relates to those two okay but first the
[32:47] ark was born of the flood 15 cubits
[32:50] above the earth remember the Bible said
[32:51] it rain from the tops of the trees up
[32:54] was 15 cubits so there was 15 cubits of
[32:57] layer of water right under the ark to
[33:01] the highest mountain I believe if I'm
[33:03] not mistaken or the highest tree or
[33:05] mountain or something along those lines
[33:06] so 15 15 cubits Hezekiah member he got
[33:12] in the permissive will of God and God
[33:15] asked for more time to set his house
[33:16] order God gave him 15 years interesting
[33:20] what were the ones I thought okay feast
[33:23] that doesn't relate to feasts here's the
[33:26] face the Jews were delivered from death
[33:29] on under Esther on the fifteenth day of
[33:32] the month
[33:35] okay
[33:37] okay that's right because the 13 then
[33:39] she fasted two days had to feast right
[33:41] yeah in the 13th 14th yeah and this is
[33:45] especially significant okay he's already
[33:46] connected that number of 13 so he
[33:48] already I already brought that one out
[33:49] on the 13th day that was supposed to be
[33:52] their execution day so 15th day of the
[33:56] month next feast
[33:59] so the 15th day of the first month was
[34:02] the feast of unleavened bread 15 and of
[34:06] course that's the day that Christ
[34:07] descended down and preached to the
[34:09] spirits that were in prison praise the
[34:11] Lord and he took the keys of death hell
[34:13] in the grave amen on that 15th day also
[34:17] the 15th day started the Feast of
[34:20] Tabernacles which types the Millennium
[34:23] for us so that's interesting too
[34:26] can't quite I don't quite know have the
[34:29] full understanding on that but we see
[34:32] that in the scripture 15 15 feasts
[34:35] connected to feasts let's go to 16 now
[34:41] also I can see in this is like a double
[34:42] 8 and 8 represented the first day all
[34:46] over again
[34:47] it represents eternity so this is
[34:50] interesting too I don't know what else
[34:52] it would mean other than that so did you
[34:56] know there are 16 descriptions of love
[34:58] in first Corinthians 13 there's 16 so
[35:03] let's read them charity suffereth long
[35:06] now if anybody should have the bachelors
[35:08] at Holy Ghost charity it ought to be you
[35:10] and I so this this ought to pertain to
[35:12] us if we don't get any number if we
[35:14] don't care about the numbers then let's
[35:15] get all 16 of these attributes in our
[35:17] lives
[35:18] amen suffer along with people be kind of
[35:22] people Envy not so you're happy for
[35:26] somebody you don't envy them doesn't
[35:29] exalt yourself and pride and is not
[35:32] puffed up number 5 does not behave
[35:36] itself unseemly right of order 7 it
[35:41] seeketh not her own but seeks others is
[35:43] not easily provoked so you have some
[35:46] thick-skinned church got thick skin
[35:50] thinketh no evil so if anything comes
[35:53] evil love just cast it down I'm not
[35:55] gonna think anything about it that's the
[35:57] one one through nine ten doesn't rejoice
[36:01] in iniquity but 11 tells us what it does
[36:04] rejoice in the truth of God's Word 12 it
[36:08] bears all things it can handle all the
[36:10] trials and handle all the hatred or evil
[36:13] or persecution it can bear all things
[36:16] and it can hope for all things praise
[36:19] the Lord we have a Living Hope in Christ
[36:21] the Bible said he's our living hope it
[36:23] can endure all things and charity never
[36:28] fails all sixteen don't you like that by
[36:31] God's grace I don't know I don't know
[36:33] what other 16s are in fact in the book
[36:36] there's not even a section for 16 it
[36:38] just kind of omits it I found this one
[36:39] later there's something from the Holy
[36:41] Spirit just reminded me of when I read
[36:43] this years ago and I thought oh they're
[36:44] 16 and so I just kind of came to me
[36:46] today
[36:47] pause and study so see after 16 it stops
[36:52] describing charity and whether there be
[36:55] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[36:57] be tongues they shall cease whether
[36:58] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[37:02] that's interesting you know what's
[37:08] interesting as I was thinking was
[37:09] because the statute permit man has seven
[37:11] but charity is eight charity's eight but
[37:15] then charity has sixteen descriptions
[37:18] now I'm just throwing numbers out there
[37:19] okay I'm just trying to work with it a
[37:21] little bit okay just get you thinking
[37:23] here get myself thinking because I'm
[37:25] trying to see what God is trying to say
[37:27] here many ways that's what we want we
[37:29] want sixteen attributes of love
[37:32] proceeding from our life if we can do
[37:35] these things will never fail praise God
[37:38] so Jesus would have raised from the dead
[37:41] on the 16th day of that first month
[37:43] right because the Passover lamb was
[37:46] killed on the fourteenth the evening of
[37:48] the 14th so 14 15 16 so again you have
[37:53] eternal life on that one so there's that
[37:57] remember there's three numbers that seem
[37:58] to type the resurrection three the third
[38:01] day the eighth day right
[38:03] Monday or Sunday and then now this the
[38:07] 15th day
[38:08] I'm sorry 16th days sorry sorry so
[38:10] there's the all these numbers that are
[38:12] pointing to the resurrection of Christ
[38:13] interesting just interesting all right
[38:19] we're already on 17 so I was like I said
[38:22] maybe we'll do 15 more minutes this
[38:23] gonna be one of my shortest servers no
[38:24] ha or maybe what I'll do you know if
[38:26] it's really short
[38:27] I'll just go preach the the second part
[38:29] from tonight I'll just combine two
[38:31] sermons into one we'll see let me see
[38:34] how that Halong long this goes here how
[38:38] long have I been preaching lady is it
[38:39] under okay well I put my timer for 15 so
[38:45] if I do half an hour I don't think
[38:47] anybody's gonna get mad at me praise the
[38:50] Lord what I'll do is I'll make sure we
[38:51] read all these scriptures okay so I've
[38:55] been studying the head on the other one
[38:57] and so I just had a little bit of time
[38:58] to work on this one I was studying at on
[39:00] the purpose I have more on that but I
[39:02] just thought you know I really want to
[39:03] get this numerology done tonight so it
[39:06] looks like 17 relates to the bride and
[39:08] this is what brother Aaron had shared a
[39:10] few things in here with me and I had not
[39:12] noticed before now but enger' in the
[39:14] book says this he said 17 stands out as
[39:17] a very prominently as a significant
[39:20] number it's not a multiple of any number
[39:23] therefore it has no factors so you can't
[39:26] divide it that's interesting you can't
[39:28] divide the Bride of Christ either she's
[39:30] United hence it is called one of the
[39:35] prime or indivisible numbers you can't
[39:37] divide us we're all on spirit praise God
[39:40] what is more it is the seventh in the
[39:44] list of prime numbers so out of seven
[39:46] prime numbers it's number seven the 17
[39:49] is seven that's interesting of course
[39:53] seven is a good rapture number with
[39:54] Enoch seven church ages right seven
[39:56] seals on the seven seals the day in the
[39:58] hour of Christ's coming so that's
[40:00] interesting house 17 is connected to a
[40:03] seven now this means a little bit to me
[40:06] I was born on the 17th day so I mean
[40:08] this means a little bit to me okay not
[40:10] too much I mean I do believe I'm a bride
[40:13] member but I'm not trying to make myself
[40:15] better than anybody
[40:16] understand I just see no well maybe God
[40:17] gave me that to encourage me I don't
[40:19] know now here's where it's really
[40:22] scriptural Church this has to do with
[40:23] the bride there were seventeen nations
[40:26] present on the day of Pentecost and
[40:28] brother Brahim said that was the birth
[40:31] of the Bride of Christ right because
[40:34] they got the Holy Ghost that's the birth
[40:36] of the bride now it was the Jewish
[40:38] portion of the bride right but later
[40:41] went to the Samaritans in Chapter eight
[40:43] and then the Gentiles in Chapter ten but
[40:46] that's the beginning of the bride
[40:47] because that's what Ephesians chapter
[40:50] two and three is all about these two
[40:52] nations Jew Gentile had become one by
[40:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[40:57] that's a great mystery that's one of the
[40:59] 12 great mysteries how that these two
[41:01] groups of people jooge então could be
[41:03] made one and they're one by the Holy
[41:05] Ghost so let's read that just so you
[41:07] guys let's go to acts 2 I got 15 minutes
[41:10] here let's see what he can do what we
[41:11] can do
[41:20] yeah it's eight through eleven that's
[41:22] right now this is significant especially
[41:26] as you get down here I mean this 153 and
[41:29] then God is trying to say something here
[41:31] and I trust he'll reveal it here a
[41:34] little bit tonight acts 2 8 and how hear
[41:38] we every man in our own tongue we're and
[41:40] we were born
[41:42] now this to me like looks like God's
[41:45] going fishing
[41:46] and he's gonna fish for within 17
[41:50] different nations that's what it looks
[41:51] like to me because it's later connected
[41:53] to fish
[41:55] okay so Parthian x' one means to
[41:58] Elamites three dwellers in Mesopotamia
[42:00] four in Judea five and in Cappadocia six
[42:04] in in Pontus seven and asia eight and
[42:07] fer gia nine and Pamphylia ten in Egypt
[42:12] eleven and the parts of Libya twelve and
[42:15] Cyrene thirteen and The Strangers of
[42:19] Rome was Ione 14 okay so this is 14
[42:25] Romans 14 okay Jews and proselytes 15
[42:31] creats 16 and Arabians 17 we do hear
[42:39] them speak in our own tongues the
[42:41] wonderful works of God amen there you go
[42:45] 17
[42:46] why 17 well 17 seems to be a multiple of
[42:52] 153 let's go to John 21:11 why there
[42:58] have to be 17 there well to me God was
[43:03] calling out his bride he was birthing
[43:06] his bride the bride was being born and
[43:09] was only going to grow from that moment
[43:10] on he started with a 17 now Church you
[43:15] know this is after Jesus had rose from
[43:18] the dead Peter said I go efficient he
[43:21] said I'm done preaching for a while I'm
[43:23] going fishing and Jesus meets them in
[43:26] verse 5 and said children have you any
[43:27] meat the answered no and then verse 6 he
[43:29] said cast a net another on the right
[43:31] side of the ship and ye shall find on
[43:33] the right
[43:33] side interesting on the right not the
[43:36] wrong the right side and then in verse
[43:39] 11 you know what happened Simon Peter
[43:42] went up and drew the net to land full of
[43:46] great fishes 153 153 and for all there
[43:50] were so many yet the net was not broken
[43:53] amen
[43:54] the net was able to hold a hundred fifty
[43:57] three which is a multiple of seventeen
[44:01] and there were seventeen nations on the
[44:03] day of Pentecost and that interesting
[44:05] Peter on the day of Pentecost was the
[44:07] one who let out the gospel net amen and
[44:11] three thousand souls were saved right
[44:13] three thousand souls were baptized out
[44:16] of 17 nations so this is striking this
[44:21] seems to be a great connection there and
[44:24] notice that they're called fish and this
[44:26] relates to Jesus seventh and final
[44:29] parable in Matthew 13 let's go there
[44:32] Matthew 13 47 1347
[44:53] all right 13:47 this is the seventh and
[44:59] final parable here in Matthew 13 again
[45:02] the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net
[45:04] that was cast in the sea and gathered of
[45:07] every kind which when it was full they
[45:09] drew to shore and sat down and gathered
[45:12] the good into vessels but the bad
[45:14] a barber cast away the bad so shall it
[45:16] be at the end of the world and the net
[45:18] shall come forth and sever the wicked
[45:20] from among the just and shall cast them
[45:24] into the furnace of fire there shall be
[45:25] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[45:28] so just interesting God would have kept
[45:30] of course the good fish here but it's
[45:33] connected to a seven and member 17 is
[45:36] the seventh prime number so just
[45:39] interesting how the fish are connected
[45:41] with 17s again and then 153 connected to
[45:44] fish there so I just thought I'd throw
[45:46] that in there to get our spiritual minds
[45:48] working there by God's grace all right
[45:50] okay let's keep going
[45:51] after this so this begins what brother
[45:54] Aaron was sharing with me Aster's the
[45:55] seventeenth Old Testament book right so
[46:00] if you count started Jenna or Genesis
[46:01] count all the way down Esther 17 so
[46:04] she's a woman and she comes out to save
[46:07] the people for such a time as this so it
[46:10] looks like a type of the bride and then
[46:14] this is interesting on the 17th day now
[46:16] I I don't can't see how this types the
[46:18] bride because this would type the
[46:19] foolish virgin but on the seventeenth
[46:22] day of the month the same day The
[46:25] Fountains of the deep broke up and the
[46:26] windows of heaven were open and it
[46:28] started raining on the 17th day of that
[46:31] month in Genesis 7:11 so again all these
[46:36] numbers here so these are Old Testament
[46:38] Scriptures so rains and then the water
[46:42] starts flowing on the 17th day it's
[46:45] interesting the ark actually came to
[46:47] rest on the 17th day as well
[46:49] but a different month the seventh month
[46:52] so it found its rest on day 17 so the
[46:55] waters broke open the water came down
[46:57] the 17th month that all that time later
[47:00] finally found its rest on the 17th these
[47:04] I don't know I'm just sharing them with
[47:05] you
[47:06] just interesting to see the 17s now back
[47:12] to the Holy Ghost and the bride now
[47:14] brother Aaron just pointed these out the
[47:17] 17s here that Christ may dwell in your
[47:20] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[47:23] grounded in love so here's a verse it's
[47:25] a 17th verse of a chapter and it's
[47:27] speaking about Christ in you and that's
[47:29] what the bride has Christ in you the
[47:31] hope of glory the Old Testament couldn't
[47:33] have that that was specifically for the
[47:36] bride and then we actually see the name
[47:38] bride the word bride in another 17 22:17
[47:42] the spirit and the bride say come and
[47:45] let him that here say come and let him
[47:48] that's a thirst come and whosoever will
[47:50] let him take of the water of life freely
[47:52] so these are just interesting
[47:54] connections you know to like the 17th
[47:58] verse you know and each chapter had to
[48:00] deal with the bride oh yeah and I like
[48:02] that - this the Holy Ghost rest in the
[48:04] heart on the on three 17 that was pretty
[48:07] good
[48:08] just like the ark rested there on the
[48:10] seventeenth day right so just so just a
[48:14] small little connection nothing maybe
[48:15] major for doctor and anything like that
[48:17] just interesting to see a little
[48:18] connection in the numbers okay now I
[48:21] want to read these now Romans 8:35 let's
[48:23] go there there are 17 things listed that
[48:28] give our true standing in Christ 17 not
[48:35] not 16
[48:37] and not 18 17 and this was in the book
[48:41] this is this is a thought from Bullinger
[48:43] here Romans 8:35 so there's a set of
[48:51] seven
[48:52] at the beginning of this scripture and
[48:54] then there's a set of ten at the end so
[48:56] a ten and a seven for a relation ten
[48:59] seven that's a connection there Romans
[49:02] 8:35 okay so here's the first list and
[49:06] who shall separate us from the love of
[49:08] Christ so let's count these tribulation
[49:10] distress persecution famine nakedness
[49:13] peril or swords there's the first seven
[49:17] so these seven will not separate the
[49:19] bride now the Paul speaking to the bride
[49:21] here brother hamster remember he's not
[49:23] preaching to sinner's he's preaching to
[49:24] the bride all right and then he breaks
[49:28] to this real thought here as is written
[49:30] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[49:32] long we are accounted as sheep for the
[49:34] slaughter
[49:36] nay and all these things we are more
[49:39] than conquerors through him that loved
[49:41] us so she we are conquering sheep amen
[49:46] we just got to give ourselves as sheep
[49:49] would write as a sheep would give itself
[49:51] as a sacrifice we just have to learn to
[49:53] give ourselves over to God for a
[49:55] sacrifice and then we're conquering
[49:56] sheep Oh hallelujah amen Brian persuaded
[50:02] now here's the list of 10 so we had a
[50:04] list of seven here's a list of 10 none
[50:08] of these seventeen things will keep us
[50:10] from the love of Christ frien persuade
[50:13] that neither death one life angels
[50:16] principalities powers things present nor
[50:19] things to come there's seven right there
[50:21] nor height nor depth nor any other
[50:24] creature there's ten shall be able to
[50:28] separate us from the love of God which
[50:30] is in Christ Jesus our Lord and the
[50:32] church said seventeen things will not
[50:35] separate the bride from the love of God
[50:38] amen
[50:39] thank you lord praise God that's
[50:42] encouraging church when we get down we
[50:44] should go read that write tribulation
[50:47] won't distress persecution famine
[50:48] nakedness
[50:49] I taught him this a few weeks ago at
[50:51] Bible Club and I had I had 17 kids line
[50:55] up or what I use I used I used it wasn't
[50:57] 17 I use 10 or 7 I actually didn't
[50:59] realize there were 17 here I think I use
[51:01] 10 yeah I think I use 10 and so I had 10
[51:03] people stand between a
[51:06] in Christ and that that believer just
[51:09] walked down and he pushed over well let
[51:11] me read the Bible I just had him walked
[51:13] down through and I said push over
[51:15] tribulation he just pushed over
[51:17] tribulation then he pushed over distress
[51:18] then he pushed over persecution then he
[51:21] pushed over famine then he pushed over
[51:23] nakedness then he pushed over pail then
[51:25] he pushed over sword and then he hugged
[51:27] Jesus because nothing can separate us
[51:29] from the love of God I thought that was
[51:32] a good illustration none of these things
[51:34] if they're in our way
[51:36] none of them can separate us from the
[51:38] love of Christ right we just speak to
[51:40] that storm it moves we we were pray God
[51:44] raised a standard up against that storm
[51:46] praise God all 17 so this shows are
[51:50] standing in Christ that nothing can
[51:53] separate us from his love so may be
[51:55] standing in the love of Christ let me
[51:57] just add that they're standing in the
[51:59] love of Christ I think I like that then
[52:03] we got that for the future I've see the
[52:06] reason I'm doing this is because Jose's
[52:08] asked me three or four times for copies
[52:09] of this sermon so I don't want to if he
[52:12] wants this copy I don't want him to miss
[52:13] out on any notes okay so I hope that's
[52:15] all right now let's go to Hebrews 12
[52:17] there's 17 ways Paul lists that the Old
[52:22] Testament is different than the new 17
[52:25] there's again that number 17 Hebrews 12
[52:28] eighteenth Hebrews 12 18
[52:47] okay and I think there are two groups as
[52:52] well let me check I'm gonna flip over to
[52:55] the Internet so he had him here yeah I
[52:57] got these from Bollinger so he has yeah
[52:59] there's a group of seven and there's a
[53:00] group of ten in Hebrews 12 so it's count
[53:03] seven first then we'll see the ten all
[53:07] right
[53:07] twelve eighteen for your not come unto
[53:10] the Mount that might not I'm sorry that
[53:12] might be touched and that burned it with
[53:14] fire nor unto blackness darkness Tempest
[53:18] and the sound of a trumpet and the voice
[53:21] of words which voice that us are they
[53:24] that heard entreated that the word
[53:26] should be spoken to them anymore
[53:29] so there must have been the seven right
[53:31] there right let me flip over here yeah
[53:34] so there's the seven right there the
[53:36] Mount could not be touched burn with
[53:38] fire there's my 15 minutes of our done
[53:40] half an hour praise the Lord burn with
[53:43] fire blackness darkness Tempest sound of
[53:46] a trumpet and the voice of words aren't
[53:48] you glad that's not the kind of church
[53:50] services you come to blackness and can't
[53:54] touch the mountain can't approach God
[53:56] but we can approach God can't we
[54:12] but ye are come to this shrink a little
[54:18] more and I'm gonna read verse 24 they
[54:26] could not endure that which was
[54:27] commanded and if so much as a beast
[54:29] touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
[54:31] thrust through with a dart and so
[54:34] terrible was this sight that Moses said
[54:36] I exceedingly fear and quake verse 22
[54:40] here it is but ye are come unto Mount
[54:43] Zion number we're looking for the Mount
[54:46] Zion showdown where is that right
[54:47] rapture brother ma'am said that's the
[54:49] rapture the Mount Zion showdown and it's
[54:52] the struggle between Christ and
[54:53] denominations all I'm glad we're a
[54:55] million miles from denominations amen
[54:58] Christ the word is who were gathered
[55:00] with tonight hallelujah we've come to
[55:02] Mount Zion we've come to the place of
[55:04] rapture haha yeah and the city of the
[55:09] Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an
[55:14] innumerable company of angels to the
[55:17] General Assembly and the Church of the
[55:19] firstborn which are written in heaven
[55:22] and to the God and to the SAR end to God
[55:28] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[55:30] just men made perfect and to Jesus the
[55:34] media of the New Covenant and to the
[55:38] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[55:40] things than that of Abel amen praise God
[55:44] what a what a difference that we have
[55:46] Church amen think of all these blessings
[55:50] here in these seventeen descriptors
[55:53] think of how our covenant is so much
[55:56] greater praise God by the blood of Jesus
[56:03] Christ Christ better things than that of
[56:05] Abel Abel cried out for vengeance avenge
[56:08] me my brother but what is the blood of
[56:09] Christ cry out for forgiveness amen
[56:13] forgive them they know not what they do
[56:16] God give us grace to forgive amen how do
[56:20] you like that is that okay you like that
[56:22] amen I think that's really inspired
[56:24] there because it's
[56:25] sure now I just got a couple more 17
[56:29] brother Aaron brought this one to my
[56:31] attention - I forgot about this one
[56:32] in 1933 brother Han says this repeatedly
[56:35] I think he says it like 14 or 20 times
[56:37] the message the pillar of fire appeared
[56:39] above brother Branham on the Ohio River
[56:40] as he was baptizing the 17th person now
[56:45] to me this message that the pillar of
[56:48] fire says is a message to the bride but
[56:53] we have said I was baptizing down on the
[56:55] river my first converts at the Ohio
[56:57] River and the 17 person I was Matt is
[56:59] that first converse when those be the
[57:00] firstfruits of the bride right through
[57:03] his ministry his ministry and the 17
[57:08] person I was baptizing and as I started
[57:10] to baptize him I said father as I
[57:12] baptized with water you baptize him with
[57:14] the Holy Spirit and I started to put him
[57:17] under the water and just when and just
[57:20] then a will came from the heavens above
[57:23] and Here Come that light shining down
[57:27] hundreds and hundreds of people on the
[57:29] bank right at two o'clock in the
[57:31] afternoon in June and it hung right over
[57:36] where I was a voice spoke from there
[57:38] said as John the Baptist was sent for
[57:40] the forerunner of the first coming of
[57:44] Christ you've got to have a message that
[57:46] will bring forth the forerunner of the
[57:48] second coming of Christ and it like this
[57:51] scare me to death
[57:52] see that as we know that presence
[57:54] doesn't make us happy that presence
[57:56] makes us fearful it's such a holy sacred
[57:59] presence so on the 17th person a message
[58:03] comes down and says you've got a message
[58:06] that's for the bride of Jesus Christ
[58:09] amen 17 hallelujah thank you lord
[58:16] all right and of course in Life magazine
[58:22] they picked it up on the cloud and it
[58:25] was published on the 17th day of May so
[58:30] again you see 17 and Bob Arum said that
[58:32] was Christ looking down at us he said
[58:35] that Christ that that cloud was Christ
[58:38] looking down at his bride so he
[58:39] not look at his bride they published it
[58:41] on the 17th so interesting there and I
[58:45] think that's it yeah that was it
[58:48] all right so how did I do there that's
[58:53] about 45 minutes let me uh let me just
[58:56] go a little bit for let me go back to
[58:57] the the message from this morning on can
[58:59] I go back to times and seasons I just
[59:00] want to do one thing real quick I heard
[59:02] a couple of amens alright so let me go I
[59:04] just want to close to this the rapture
[59:09] has times and seasons you know the words
[59:12] times and seasons are only in the Bible
[59:14] a handful of times I forget how many the
[59:16] actual phrase times and seasons
[59:19] well this connects perfectly cuz this
[59:21] deals with the bride so what a great way
[59:23] to close 17 is the Brides number and
[59:25] let's close with times and seasons for
[59:28] the bride know did you ever notice this
[59:33] it's it's been real to me this week
[59:36] because I've been each morning I get up
[59:38] I try to get up at 4:30 or 5:00 and then
[59:40] I always start with prayer read a
[59:42] chapter in the Bible and then I do the
[59:43] Facebook post today was my hundredth day
[59:45] in a row I've done the Facebook post and
[59:48] then for that I do an hour of writing on
[59:51] the book and after that then I devote
[59:54] some time to study for this the writing
[59:58] on the rapture chapter I'm almost done I
[59:59] got a couple more sections to do I'm
[1:00:02] gonna do with two sections the next
[1:00:04] section is on the reasons why the
[1:00:06] rapture has to be secret and of course
[1:00:07] that's because Satan could do great
[1:00:08] damage I'm gonna tie that in with hair
[1:00:10] and how Herod knew and Jesus was gonna
[1:00:12] be born or after he was born so he did
[1:00:14] great damage he killed thousands of
[1:00:16] Jewish baby boys and course Roman boys
[1:00:19] too but how much damage would Satan do
[1:00:22] if he knew about the time of the rapture
[1:00:25] he'd go to killing right because he
[1:00:27] wants to kill destroy but also in that
[1:00:32] chapter I'm going to add the last sign
[1:00:34] I'm working on there right now
[1:00:35] the last sign for the rapture cuz
[1:00:37] brother Graham told us thus say at the
[1:00:38] Lord
[1:00:38] the last sign that God gave to Abraham
[1:00:40] and Sarah before the body change was God
[1:00:43] in flesh discerning the thoughts and
[1:00:44] intents of Abraham and Sarah's heart
[1:00:46] while they were in the tent right that
[1:00:49] was the last sign and it was LA
[1:00:51] yesterday I went read I read
[1:00:53] chapters 20 21 and 22 I read that
[1:00:55] yesterday that was God's last visit to
[1:00:57] them before the body change because
[1:01:02] chapter 19 was the destruction chapter
[1:01:04] 20 was Abraham's laps in Greer with King
[1:01:08] Abimelech right and God didn't reveal
[1:01:11] anything there was no signs from God in
[1:01:12] that one God didn't come to them and
[1:01:15] then 21 God visited Sarah and touched
[1:01:19] her and then that came then came Isaac
[1:01:22] so the last sign before the visitation
[1:01:25] to bring forth the promised son was the
[1:01:28] discernment and that's why brother Ram
[1:01:29] says over and over he said my ministry
[1:01:32] is the last sign of the Gentiles before
[1:01:33] the body change thus saith the Lord so
[1:01:36] that's quite a statement to make amen
[1:01:38] so anyways and we're dealing with that
[1:01:42] this week I noticed that the last time
[1:01:45] times and seasons are used is in 1st
[1:01:48] Thessalonians chapter 5 right after the
[1:01:50] rapture but I would not have you to be
[1:01:52] ignorant brethren concerning them which
[1:01:54] are asleep that you sorrow not even as
[1:01:56] others which have no hope for if we
[1:01:59] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[1:02:01] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[1:02:03] will God bring with them can you imagine
[1:02:05] church they didn't have a New Testament
[1:02:07] so when the when the Christians at
[1:02:11] Thessalonica died they would be
[1:02:13] sorrowing and Paul's like I got to
[1:02:15] encourage them Lord what should I write
[1:02:17] to encourage them so he writes about the
[1:02:19] rapture to encourage them amen there
[1:02:22] they're I mean they're just they don't
[1:02:23] have a Bible you and I get to read this
[1:02:25] and we can be so happy but they didn't
[1:02:28] have that so God leads Paul to write and
[1:02:31] tell them they're not dead in fact
[1:02:34] they'll rise first amen don't be
[1:02:38] discouraged don't be sorrowful there's
[1:02:40] hope don't be hopeless
[1:02:42] these Christians that have died you'll
[1:02:43] see them again fact you'll see them
[1:02:45] first for this we say to you by the word
[1:02:49] of the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:02:52] remain on the coming of the Lord shall
[1:02:53] not prevent them which are asleep for
[1:02:58] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:02:59] heaven with a shout that's what we've
[1:03:01] heard the cry with the voice of the
[1:03:03] Archangel that's the resurrection of the
[1:03:05] Dead
[1:03:07] and with a trump of god that's the body
[1:03:08] change and the of the believer and the
[1:03:11] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[1:03:15] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:03:17] caught up together with them in the
[1:03:18] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:03:20] so shall we ever be with the Lord that's
[1:03:27] interesting the meeting in the air is in
[1:03:29] verse 17 like is that a 17 in here
[1:03:35] that's what I mean they they rise first
[1:03:37] but where do we meet on that seventy
[1:03:39] first God's just trying to keep his
[1:03:43] encourage church right wherefore comfort
[1:03:46] one another with these words this is a
[1:03:48] great comfort to us the dead in Christ
[1:03:50] will see the dead in Christ first before
[1:03:53] we are changed I believe that now
[1:03:56] remember there was no chapter 5 so the
[1:03:59] letter ended with this comfort one
[1:04:01] another with the words now look he goes
[1:04:03] into the last time this is record in
[1:04:05] Scripture the last time times and
[1:04:07] seasons are mentioned are for the bra
[1:04:09] for us and Paul says you dump have need
[1:04:14] for me to write unto you about the times
[1:04:18] and seasons of the rapture
[1:04:20] now that's striking and the reason he
[1:04:26] goes on to say is because you are
[1:04:29] children of the day in other words
[1:04:31] you'll be so awake you'll see things so
[1:04:34] clearly that you it's impossible for you
[1:04:38] to miss the rapture amen he said you
[1:04:41] don't need for me to tell you about
[1:04:43] times and seasons because the rapture to
[1:04:45] you will happen in broad daylight amen
[1:04:48] glory is that what the Word of God says
[1:04:52] church look at this but other times it
[1:04:55] seasons brethren you have no not need
[1:04:58] brother Jess you need to preach to
[1:04:59] unrest at times and scenes of the
[1:05:01] rapture apparently I don't because we'll
[1:05:04] be so awake in righteousness that it'll
[1:05:08] be like a regular daytime event right
[1:05:12] that's what Paul says he says you don't
[1:05:15] need for me to write to you now these
[1:05:17] are this is striking these are the same
[1:05:19] people who are sorrowing and so
[1:05:20] sad will ever see my really my loved
[1:05:22] ones again and Paul says you will take
[1:05:25] comfort in the rapture the shout voice
[1:05:27] Trump take comfort in that and he says
[1:05:29] you don't need for me to tell you about
[1:05:31] the times and seasons because you're so
[1:05:33] awake it's impossible for you to miss it
[1:05:35] if somebody tried to walk into your
[1:05:37] house and steal something while you're
[1:05:39] awake would you be able to catch them or
[1:05:40] not yeah you think you could of course
[1:05:45] you see them there be no let me know no
[1:05:49] question about it your shouldn't be here
[1:05:51] it's not your property
[1:05:53] doesn't belong to you well in this case
[1:05:55] the thief's not taking something of ours
[1:05:58] the thief has taken us amen right Jesus
[1:06:02] said I come as a thief see it's like
[1:06:04] he's stealing us away from the devil's
[1:06:06] grips that's right for yourselves know
[1:06:11] perfectly that the day of Lord so cometh
[1:06:12] as a thief in the night
[1:06:16] so for Satan in the sinners it'll be
[1:06:18] like it's nighttime and Jesus sneaks in
[1:06:21] and snatches his wife away for when they
[1:06:26] shall say peace and safety then sudden
[1:06:28] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:06:30] upon a woman with child and they shall
[1:06:32] not escape but ye brother
[1:06:38] are not in darkness that that day should
[1:06:39] overtake you as a thief so this is why
[1:06:41] you don't need me to tell you how it's
[1:06:44] gonna be like this or because you are
[1:06:47] not children of the night you're
[1:06:50] children of the day verse 5 you all
[1:06:53] sugar the light of the church of the day
[1:06:54] we are not other like North darkness so
[1:06:58] we have to worry about any thief or we
[1:07:00] don't worry about any surprise about the
[1:07:01] rapture hey there's nothing we no
[1:07:03] surprise about the rapture for you and I
[1:07:05] will be expecting it
[1:07:07] we'll be looking for it we'll be loving
[1:07:09] it amen he said coming to all those that
[1:07:12] love his appearing Paul said let us not
[1:07:18] sleep as others do but let us watch and
[1:07:21] be sober oh thank you lord
[1:07:25] now church sober means calm so see when
[1:07:29] you start feeling your your pulse racing
[1:07:31] oh my god mr. rapture manga mr. rapture
[1:07:33] that's not scriptural we've got to cast
[1:07:36] down the fear in Jesus Christ's name I
[1:07:38] looked it up but what does that doesn't
[1:07:40] mean well I'm not going to get drunk
[1:07:41] that that has nothing I mean a Christian
[1:07:43] would be million miles away from that
[1:07:44] it's not sober like I'm not drinking
[1:07:47] alcohol wine or Bud Light or it has
[1:07:50] nothing to do with that
[1:07:51] it's a calmness what is it it's a
[1:07:53] confidence watch for Christ's rapture
[1:07:58] for us with confidence be calm about it
[1:08:03] remember those shirts keep calm and keep
[1:08:05] calm and trust the rapture is gonna
[1:08:07] happen I got a new shirt for them right
[1:08:09] they say keep calm and do I don't forget
[1:08:11] I forget some of the sayings they have
[1:08:12] on there keep calm and watch for the
[1:08:15] coming of Christ I got a new shirt now
[1:08:18] praise the Lord
[1:08:20] so see sinners don't have any idea about
[1:08:22] the times and seasons but we already
[1:08:24] know there's no need to write about it
[1:08:27] because we're awake we'll see it coming
[1:08:30] it won't it won't overtake us as a thief
[1:08:33] now see even this foolish virgin knows
[1:08:35] Church so people that have heard the
[1:08:36] shout they've heard brother rams
[1:08:38] messages she knew so she was seeking the
[1:08:42] oil too late it was too late there's 45
[1:08:46] minutes praise God
[1:08:48] see it was too late for her didn't use
[1:08:51] her time wisely like we preached on this
[1:08:53] morning redeem the time right point your
[1:08:57] life accurately at the target right walk
[1:09:00] accurately walk into God's plan for your
[1:09:03] life do God's purpose for your life live
[1:09:05] an accurate straight life according the
[1:09:07] perfect will of God and then you won't
[1:09:09] be seeking oil at the last minute you
[1:09:11] already have it praise God you already
[1:09:14] hit the mark praise the Lord you've
[1:09:15] already already marked with the Holy
[1:09:17] Ghost oh thank you lord now let's keep
[1:09:20] reading a few more for they that sleep
[1:09:22] sleep in the night and they that be
[1:09:24] drunken or drunk in the night but let us
[1:09:26] who are the day be sober that means
[1:09:27] called now I'm gonna close with this
[1:09:30] thought about the whole armor of God
[1:09:31] that's why I want to close with so Paul
[1:09:36] says if we are of the day if we don't
[1:09:38] need anybody to preach to us about the
[1:09:41] times and seasons of the rapture he says
[1:09:44] then watch be sober and put on the
[1:09:47] breastplate of faith and love and for an
[1:09:51] helmet the hope of salvation for God
[1:09:55] hath not obtained appointed us under
[1:09:56] wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[1:09:59] Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that
[1:10:03] whether we wake or sleep we should live
[1:10:04] together with him so did you ever catch
[1:10:08] this paw follows up the rapture and
[1:10:12] chapter 4 by saying we don't need to
[1:10:15] know the times and seasons because we're
[1:10:17] children of the day we're not going to
[1:10:19] be surprised like a thief at nighttime
[1:10:21] because we're watching like soldiers who
[1:10:25] are ready to fight now see that part was
[1:10:29] never connected to me really till I
[1:10:31] studied it this week and then you can
[1:10:33] connect that to Ephesians 6 with the
[1:10:35] full armor of God he just lists two
[1:10:37] parts of the six pieces of armor he just
[1:10:39] lists two here but we know that they all
[1:10:43] go together Paul lists at all six in
[1:10:45] Ephesians six there's a six so he all
[1:10:50] right now here I'm taking an excerpt
[1:10:52] this is an excerpt from my book the next
[1:10:55] one like I said the first one it goes on
[1:10:57] presale on Friday and then it goes on
[1:10:59] sale on the fifteenth so I finally got
[1:11:01] the dates I
[1:11:01] announced yet but that's because I'm a
[1:11:03] little nervous like I don't know if my
[1:11:05] publisher is gonna get outside of an
[1:11:07] announcement I'm a little nervous my
[1:11:08] first time doing it so anyways this is
[1:11:11] for the next book the Apostle describes
[1:11:13] the times and scenes of the rapture with
[1:11:14] two descriptors first sinners will be
[1:11:16] unaware of the rapture just as drunk and
[1:11:18] sleeping robbery victims are caught off
[1:11:20] guard by a nighttime thief Jesus teaches
[1:11:24] the same idea when he likens the day of
[1:11:26] the Lord as the days of Noah in which
[1:11:28] the lost kept eating drinking and
[1:11:30] marrying right up until the flood came
[1:11:32] and took them away so they're both
[1:11:33] unaware oh we'll just keep going and
[1:11:36] eating drinking being Mary there's no
[1:11:37] there's no destruction coming the same
[1:11:39] idea and then Paul compares the sinners
[1:11:42] to sleeping drunks second Paul proclaims
[1:11:45] the world's mantra so they'll be saying
[1:11:47] peace and safety peace and safety peace
[1:11:49] and safety at the time of Christ Sutton
[1:11:54] wraps your event it's striking to
[1:11:56] imagine how contrary the thoughts and
[1:11:58] plans of sinners will be compared to
[1:12:00] those of God so God's thinking so God is
[1:12:04] planning worldwide war at Armageddon and
[1:12:06] destruction
[1:12:07] so God thinking war destruction and the
[1:12:10] sinners are saying peace and safety
[1:12:11] total opposite right that shows you how
[1:12:15] far they are from the mind of God when
[1:12:18] you see these articles on Facebook about
[1:12:20] bortion and judgments of God they're
[1:12:21] exactly right God is thinking
[1:12:24] destruction war and the world thinking
[1:12:27] peace and safety that's just all get
[1:12:28] along let's just think I'll keep it
[1:12:29] living as long as we want to you know
[1:12:32] none of these guys are than these North
[1:12:33] Korea guys and you know Russia they're
[1:12:35] not going to shoot off that that missile
[1:12:37] with those atomic bombs yet because they
[1:12:40] want to keep living here they love the
[1:12:42] world but the Bible says that we should
[1:12:45] not love the things of the world nor the
[1:12:46] world itself amen they really don't want
[1:12:50] a war now they will eventually when they
[1:12:51] do when they start hating the but
[1:12:54] right now they don't want a war they
[1:12:56] want to keep living lusciously
[1:12:58] luxuriously all those things they don't
[1:13:00] want to serve Christ they want to have
[1:13:01] they want to have their heaven right
[1:13:04] here on earth but we don't have heaven
[1:13:06] on earth right we have heaven when
[1:13:07] heaven comes down to earth that's right
[1:13:14] no and I say our Christians living in a
[1:13:15] world that matches these description yet
[1:13:17] partially no doubt see it each day we're
[1:13:19] getting closer and closer to these now
[1:13:21] this is small I'm sorry but the Bible I
[1:13:25] just list seven other reasons that prove
[1:13:27] were at the time of the rapture scoffers
[1:13:29] mocking that's what Peter says people be
[1:13:31] scoffing huh the lord the coming of the
[1:13:34] Lord Jesus Christ will return they'll be
[1:13:36] scoffing at it the the conditions of
[1:13:38] Noah violence attractive women
[1:13:40] continually evil thoughts Luke 17
[1:13:42] Genesis 6 the sodomite conditions of
[1:13:45] lot's time will be repeated Luke 17 many
[1:13:48] churches come in a great falling away
[1:13:50] 2nd Thessalonians 2 we see that men will
[1:13:53] love themselves more than God they'll be
[1:13:55] covetous boasters proud blasphemers this
[1:13:57] will be in the parents thumb thankful
[1:13:58] unholy without natural affection
[1:14:00] trucebreakers false accusers incontinent
[1:14:02] fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:14:04] traitors heady - having a form of
[1:14:06] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:14:08] I need to count those mercy but can I do
[1:14:11] it real quick one two three four five
[1:14:14] six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[1:14:18] thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
[1:14:22] seventeen Wow
[1:14:25] so at the time of the bride when the
[1:14:27] bride's at seventeen they have a
[1:14:29] seventeen impersonation in that striking
[1:14:31] I didn't plan that either just like I
[1:14:35] was telling you with Benjamin I didn't
[1:14:36] plan that four year thing that would
[1:14:37] that was just kind of I just kind of
[1:14:39] happened my goodness mercy the New
[1:14:47] Testament gospel will have been preached
[1:14:49] to all the world so in other words the
[1:14:52] message will hear about the message
[1:14:53] starting to go more around the globe and
[1:14:55] finish all the nations around the globe
[1:14:56] that that's what Wessel will know about
[1:14:58] and then Israel be ready to return to
[1:15:02] God and we may see them the beginning of
[1:15:05] the building of the temple or we may not
[1:15:06] I I personally think we'll start to see
[1:15:09] it that's what I personally think
[1:15:11] because I think they I think when the
[1:15:13] bride goes up those two witnesses that
[1:15:17] anointing has to come down because God
[1:15:20] works God works by days with Israel days
[1:15:22] like he counted the day and the year 70
[1:15:26] weeks right
[1:15:28] all those you know 490 years like he
[1:15:30] counts every day so I believe the day
[1:15:33] the bride goes up that'll be the same
[1:15:35] day that anointing comes down for the
[1:15:36] two witnesses and then they'll start
[1:15:38] worshipping because they only have three
[1:15:40] and a half years I mean three and a half
[1:15:41] years I guess you could build a temple
[1:15:44] within that but they'd have to work fast
[1:15:45] depends how build that how big the
[1:15:47] temple is but I honestly I'm believing
[1:15:50] see how I'm believing God will do
[1:15:52] everything he can to get us in rapturing
[1:15:55] faith mode amen oh we just raised our
[1:15:59] faith to see that shrine come down on
[1:16:02] the Temple Mount and then to see those
[1:16:03] you start building the temple again amen
[1:16:06] how that would raise our faith and then
[1:16:08] on top of that to see brother Branham
[1:16:11] alive or Paul or these dead in Christ by
[1:16:16] all--they if we did that all things are
[1:16:18] possible amen
[1:16:20] ah to have bride members show up in our
[1:16:24] church services there Saint John the
[1:16:27] Divine I mean all we'd be screaming
[1:16:29] shouting and passing out and then for
[1:16:33] let's say 40 days if it was 40 days like
[1:16:35] they did for Jesus can you imagine the
[1:16:38] faith oh my you would have to drag
[1:16:39] anybody to church then we'd have to beg
[1:16:42] anybody to pray or you wanted to beg
[1:16:44] anybody to a preacher hear the word come
[1:16:46] up for prayer you know what's a bag
[1:16:47] anything oh my the faith you just be
[1:16:49] raised that's just my thought I could be
[1:16:55] wrong on that I just really believe God
[1:16:57] will do everything he can do that we
[1:16:59] don't have to worry about the times and
[1:17:00] seasons oh we have to worry about that
[1:17:02] it's like daytime to us Jesus coming is
[1:17:05] like we're just waiting for him to open
[1:17:07] the door we're just we're already it's
[1:17:09] daytime we're sitting on the porch
[1:17:10] waiting for Christ to show up or just
[1:17:13] swinging the swing and just resting
[1:17:15] under this we're just resting on this
[1:17:16] seven seal its resting time glory now
[1:17:22] here's what I want to close Paul says
[1:17:24] the Christians only hope for being
[1:17:27] spiritually awakened soberly watching
[1:17:29] for Christ returns by putting on the
[1:17:30] full armor of God and I never really
[1:17:33] thought about this till now remember
[1:17:35] brother Ram said in 1962 Peter didn't
[1:17:38] have the full armor of God on until we
[1:17:40] went to Pentecost
[1:17:41] then when he went to Pentecost now he's
[1:17:44] got the full armor of God on thank you
[1:17:48] Lord amen so people who are born again
[1:17:52] by the Holy Ghost it's like their eyes
[1:17:55] it's it's it's like the difference
[1:17:57] between night and day how many can say
[1:17:59] amen to that
[1:18:00] think about the time you got the Holy
[1:18:01] Ghost it should have been night and day
[1:18:03] or should have felt a little bit like
[1:18:04] night and day before I had the Holy
[1:18:07] Ghost it was like darkness kind of
[1:18:09] getting lights ain't vacation you know
[1:18:10] but once you got the Holy Ghost the
[1:18:12] light should have been on well I see
[1:18:15] what Christ is doing now I'm not living
[1:18:17] in darkness anymore I'm a child of the
[1:18:19] light amen so Paul describes two pieces
[1:18:29] of armor in 1st Thessalonians 5 and then
[1:18:34] there's 6 described in Ephesians 6 so it
[1:18:39] behooves us to understand each piece of
[1:18:41] armor that we may be able to withstand
[1:18:43] the evil day having done all to stand so
[1:18:48] here's just a brief summary and I'll go
[1:18:50] through these kind of quick the
[1:18:52] breastplate of faith and love now what
[1:18:55] is the physical breastplate do I was
[1:18:56] looking it up in the Bible commentaries
[1:18:58] it protects the heart and other vital
[1:19:02] organs right in this chest cavity right
[1:19:05] so it protects the heart the lungs the
[1:19:08] the chest here abdomen so just as a
[1:19:13] physical breastplate protects the heart
[1:19:15] and other vital organs down to the waist
[1:19:18] because that's where the girdle is so
[1:19:21] does righteous I'm sorry just as a
[1:19:25] righteous obedient Christian life of
[1:19:28] integrity protects our heart from
[1:19:32] Satan's attack on our character so
[1:19:36] that's what I thought because it's
[1:19:37] called a breastplate of what
[1:19:38] righteousness and righteousness is doing
[1:19:41] what's right it's a very simple Greek
[1:19:42] word
[1:19:43] it just means you do what's right so
[1:19:45] when you do right so much brother bang
[1:19:47] in Malachi when you do right things all
[1:19:50] the time it's like you've got this
[1:19:51] protective shield of righteousness over
[1:19:53] your heart and no matter
[1:19:55] what Satan says about your character you
[1:19:57] know you live a Christian life you might
[1:19:59] fall short of the glory but your heart
[1:20:01] is protected behind a breastplate of
[1:20:04] righteousness amen
[1:20:06] I know I used to live on righteously but
[1:20:09] I know I live righteously now st. you
[1:20:12] try to attack me all he wants for the
[1:20:14] Amen but I know I live a righteous life
[1:20:16] i crucify this guy every day and then I
[1:20:21] got a crucified the next day he comes
[1:20:24] back to life I got to crucify him again
[1:20:26] the next day
[1:20:27] we know our heart our our heart our
[1:20:30] feelings our character is protected by
[1:20:32] the righteousness of Jesus Christ he's
[1:20:35] made me righteous he produced a
[1:20:37] righteous life he strengthens me to do
[1:20:40] the right things amen helmet of
[1:20:45] salvation just as a physical helmet
[1:20:48] protects the head the command center and
[1:20:50] the most complex organ in the human body
[1:20:52] the most complex place so does the hope
[1:20:57] of salvation which is the assurance that
[1:21:00] we're saying to forgive my Jesus
[1:21:01] sacrifice protect us from Saint attempt
[1:21:04] to make us doubt our salvation right so
[1:21:09] Jesus's hope protects our most complex
[1:21:13] wish right that we're saved right we
[1:21:17] don't want to be lost so the most were
[1:21:19] protected by that hope God protects us
[1:21:22] with the hope of salvation he protects
[1:21:25] us in our mind Satan's eyes say you're
[1:21:26] not safe you're not safe how could you
[1:21:28] be safe how could you be saved I'm saved
[1:21:30] by the protection of the hope that
[1:21:32] Christ has given me amen
[1:21:35] that's what protects my most complex
[1:21:38] questions my most complex part my
[1:21:42] control center that look
[1:21:43] protects my control center is the hope
[1:21:46] of salvation praise God now church are
[1:21:51] you putting all these on every day yeah
[1:21:53] maybe not specifically but if you pray
[1:21:55] and repent you're putting them on right
[1:21:58] if you get in the under the anointing
[1:21:59] you're putting these on I'll be honest I
[1:22:02] don't think I've ever got up one day and
[1:22:03] put on all six parts but maybe I need to
[1:22:05] do that tomorrow but see when you were
[1:22:08] when you and I
[1:22:09] say Jesus forgive me empower me today
[1:22:11] fill me with more of your power and love
[1:22:13] you are putting on the full armor of God
[1:22:17] next loins gird about with truth a girl
[1:22:20] means a man could tuck his long flowing
[1:22:22] robe into his belt and abling him to
[1:22:25] travel run or work in the same way a
[1:22:27] Christians mind is gird up win the Bible
[1:22:30] truth calmly prepared to be victorious
[1:22:34] in spiritual mind battles and successful
[1:22:38] in his ministries work because the
[1:22:40] Bible's Peter said gird up the loins of
[1:22:42] your mind so this means you're calming
[1:22:45] your mind and no matter what no matter
[1:22:47] what law comes after me God will bring
[1:22:49] me the answer in my mind I'm not worried
[1:22:53] I'm not scared about my battles that
[1:22:55] Satan's gonna try to bring me I know I
[1:22:57] got a meeting with another believer
[1:22:58] today I'm not scared about what's gonna
[1:23:00] happen because in my mind my mind is
[1:23:02] gird up I'm ready I'm calm I'm ready to
[1:23:06] do God's will my mind is calm
[1:23:09] see it's gird up it's ready I've studied
[1:23:12] I prayed I put this in the hand of God I
[1:23:14] fasted I did all these things I know I
[1:23:17] know I'm ready by God's grace hallelujah
[1:23:20] thank you lord
[1:23:22] feet shod with the preparation of the
[1:23:24] gospel of peace that's stand here I'll
[1:23:26] have you stand here just to make sure we
[1:23:27] finish soldiers feet so they had they
[1:23:32] had two things they had sandals that
[1:23:33] protect their foot here on top and the
[1:23:35] sides and the bottoms and then they have
[1:23:37] these Greaves that kind of connect are
[1:23:39] protected from like their ankle up to
[1:23:41] their knee you've seen them you know
[1:23:43] you're the pictures how they have those
[1:23:44] those metal plates the Bible describes
[1:23:50] goliaths Greaves
[1:23:52] so he had those big metal Greaves
[1:23:54] they're kind of thin of course you know
[1:23:56] thin metal that covered the legs so just
[1:24:00] as that they were protected their feet
[1:24:02] and legs were protected by sandals and
[1:24:04] Greaves to ensure their progress in
[1:24:07] traveling and in war like the last thing
[1:24:09] a soldier needs is to step on some
[1:24:11] thorns and then he can't fight because
[1:24:12] he can't walk so he's his walk his
[1:24:16] traveling and his war has to be
[1:24:18] protected so in the same way your daily
[1:24:22] try
[1:24:22] levels and your decisions because that's
[1:24:25] what we travel spiritually in our
[1:24:26] decisions right are made only after
[1:24:30] prayerful preparation produces God's
[1:24:33] peace in our hearts because it's the
[1:24:35] gospel of peace so your daily travels
[1:24:38] even where physically you know you chose
[1:24:40] to go to church at eight thank God for
[1:24:41] that
[1:24:42] why did you choose that because the
[1:24:44] peace of God led you into that right the
[1:24:47] Bible said feet shod with the
[1:24:48] preparation of the gospel of peace you
[1:24:50] had peace you it's been revealed to you
[1:24:52] I got to go to church I got a feed there
[1:24:54] I got to show God which side I'm on I
[1:24:55] got a report to the courthouse and I got
[1:24:58] to hear God's Word for today see your
[1:25:03] feet are shod your daily travels and
[1:25:06] your daily decisions are made with peace
[1:25:09] in your heart so that's what that's how
[1:25:12] that represents I believe because I put
[1:25:14] these scriptures together two more the
[1:25:17] shield of faith just as a soldier shield
[1:25:21] protects all the other pieces so the
[1:25:23] first floor we mentioned those four
[1:25:25] connected by this are protected by this
[1:25:27] one by faith so just as a shield
[1:25:31] protects the other four from the fiery
[1:25:36] arrows the Bible said so does faith
[1:25:38] which is a revelation right or assurance
[1:25:41] so faith in Christ completely protects a
[1:25:44] Christians armor by extinguishing or
[1:25:47] stifling every falsehood Satan shoots
[1:25:49] from the bow of his lying tongue right
[1:25:55] so your daily travels your daily
[1:25:57] decisions of a peace your helmet of
[1:25:59] salvation your breastplate your
[1:26:01] righteousness your girdle of truth all
[1:26:03] those mined areas all that peace in mind
[1:26:05] and salvation it's all protected by
[1:26:07] faith or revelation of God God's
[1:26:10] revealed to me the word and that's what
[1:26:12] easily extinguishes all those fiery
[1:26:16] attacks of Satan all those lies
[1:26:18] so church the next time we get a lie we
[1:26:20] got to say no devil it's thus saith the
[1:26:22] Lord God is my healer he says he tries
[1:26:25] to say you're gonna die or you're sick
[1:26:27] let that shield of faith that says by
[1:26:30] His stripes I'm healed let that
[1:26:32] extinguish every fiery dart of the devil
[1:26:34] amen
[1:26:36] because it's thus saith the Lord the
[1:26:37] Word of God hallelujah lastly just as a
[1:26:43] soldier sword was his main offensive and
[1:26:45] lethal weapon the Word of God spoken
[1:26:48] through a Christians mouth will resist
[1:26:51] wound and even bruise the devil
[1:26:54] eventually putting to flight his evil
[1:26:57] forces see if you speak long enough if
[1:27:00] you and I quote the word long enough
[1:27:02] pretty soon the devil's gonna go
[1:27:03] it took Jesus three hacks it Satan to
[1:27:06] make him go in Matthew chapter 4 3 good
[1:27:09] attacks and Satan after that he left him
[1:27:12] for a season and that's what I put right
[1:27:15] there
[1:27:16] remember when Christ comes back to the
[1:27:18] earth at Armageddon a sword of judgment
[1:27:21] comes out of his mouth to smite the
[1:27:23] nation's so Church I'll just skip this
[1:27:30] what's our only hope our hope is to have
[1:27:33] the full armor of God you have the Lord
[1:27:35] tonight Malachi Niemann once you come
[1:27:37] here I thought that'd be good for us to
[1:27:40] see those things
[1:27:49] last time times and seasons are
[1:27:51] mentioned for the bride here he says you
[1:27:54] don't have need of that when you live
[1:27:57] when you and I live a righteous life a
[1:27:59] life of godliness and obedience with the
[1:28:00] full armor of god on we're not going to
[1:28:02] be surprised we're gonna be ready for us
[1:28:04] coming how many want to be ready for the
[1:28:06] coming of christ with the full armor of
[1:28:09] god on now think about your armor today
[1:28:11] let's look let's bow our heads and pray
[1:28:13] about that if we're not able to
[1:28:15] withstand lies or temptations it's
[1:28:19] because we let down the armor right Paul
[1:28:25] clearly says that us who are of the day
[1:28:31] must be sober calm we can take a deep
[1:28:35] breath in the morning when we pray say
[1:28:38] Lord with calm confidence I'm putting on
[1:28:40] the full armor of God what a hope that
[1:28:48] we have Church now with your head bowed
[1:28:56] has Satan attacked you this week about
[1:28:58] your character if so let's put on the
[1:29:02] breastplate of righteousness as you
[1:29:05] tried to make you feel bad about your
[1:29:07] character how about your helmet of
[1:29:12] salvation have you down to your
[1:29:13] salvation this week if so there's a
[1:29:18] helmet that we can put on phrase God if
[1:29:24] you had lots of mind battles and you
[1:29:26] haven't felt ready to take on these mind
[1:29:28] battles well then by God's grace let's
[1:29:30] go to our loins about with truth
[1:29:33] let's get that skirt tucked in there
[1:29:36] right let's get ready to do something
[1:29:39] for the Lord ministry in our minds have
[1:29:43] we made decisions with peace in our
[1:29:45] hearts that we made daily travels with
[1:29:47] the peace of God in our hearts in each
[1:29:50] of us say we've had peace and the
[1:29:52] decisions we made this week I'm trusting
[1:29:57] the Holy Spirit to speak to each person
[1:29:58] here I hope you are too have you felt
[1:30:04] that you've got burned by one of Satan's
[1:30:08] fiery arrows it's burned you and maybe
[1:30:11] we're holding up the shield of faith
[1:30:13] like you you needed to it's time to let
[1:30:18] the Holy Spirit heal that right that
[1:30:20] fiery wound and hold that shield up with
[1:30:24] strength and lastly the sword of the
[1:30:27] Spirit amen
[1:30:28] I'm holding up the sword right now in
[1:30:30] the Bible praise God do you just feel
[1:30:35] like the Satan's been hanging around and
[1:30:37] hasn't left you and you need to use that
[1:30:40] sword of the Spirit amen
