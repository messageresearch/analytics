message of encouragement no this morning was a message of scouring out you you our visitors will not be coming tonight so I just read into heaven will give them rest they had some worn-out reps 19 20 I'll read verse 20 and then we'll all read verse 21 verse 20 says that when he was demanded the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation now it's all read verse 21 together on three one two three neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is with me let's have one more word of Prayer as Bart it's here Heavenly Father Lord we're thankful for the kingdom of heaven that's come down to earth Lord oh yes we give you glory we thank you that it's power it and it's joined the Holy Ghost and it's joy unspeakable and full of glory in our souls oh god father we just pray Lord you give us a fresh look at this here tonight encourage our hearts Lord God I know you will because your word is so powerful Lord they meet every need Lord may we just find our position in this great Kingdom or that will be a part of the future Kingdom father that would we know we'll get to live with you forever Lord God and always be before your face smart as your as your wife as your bride the scripture says we just want to be close to you Lord yes by your grace and your mercy by the blood of Christ in Jesus Christ's name the terrset amen god bless you be in see the praise the Lord so let's look I've got a good Bible study here tonight looking forward to this here I just want a real quick review part one from last week I just wanted to sit maybe one minute remember the word Kingdom means ruled or domain or realm okay so when Jesus says the kingdom of God is within you he's meaning the realm of heaven is in you that's what the Bible says the authority we don't have power we have authority so the authority of God is in us that Dominion that rule the realm so we're ruled by the Holy Spirit right we live our lives by the Holy Spirit that's the kingdom of God in you last week we saw how he already has made us kings and priests so once you've got the spirit of the kingdom in you now you're a teen king that hangs over Sid praise guy and you're a king in brief so he starts by putting you into the kingdom and then when you're in the kingdom now you're a king and now you're a priest or queen we'd say as a as a sister so now what man tells us plainly I didn't read this last week but my man tells us plainly that acts 2:38 is the way to the kingdom this is the falling apart of the world December 16 1962 he said God's kingdom is not of this world when Christ was here to give us the program of his kingdom he gave us the program of God's kingdom the father's kingdom which is his work now if you want to know how to get the kingdom that's or this words got it he said you cannot come into any other door he says Peter on the day of Pentecost opened the door to the kingdom the kingdom had just been set up at Jerusalem he said I want some man to tell me that church begin at Rome I want somebody improve that to me the church never began in Rome it began in Jerusalem the kingdom was set up on the day of Pentecost Peter said repent he said and when men wanted to know how to get into this kingdom he said we'd met everyone you'd be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost cuz that's what puts them into the kingdom and the other policy is a false messiah amen no matter what you are pastor Bishop whatever you are it's false til you come back to God's humble lamb and his baby shouting Lori this is all the key this how you get the kingdom by acts 2:38 and the baptism of the Holy Ghost we also saw last week how the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of God or what in the because Jesus gave Peter the keys to the kingdom of heaven but then he said the kingdom of God is within you praise God so there's all those scriptures I guess I can look at him real briefly here so the kingdom of God Jesus said you're not far from the kingdom of God Jesus preached the kingdom of heaven jesus said you're not far from the kingdom of God the ten virgins heard the voice to the kingdom of heaven and Peter had the keys the Holy Ghost to the kingdom of heaven so we have kingdom of God II know the heaven they're all within the same you know the same thing we saw that last week and it's gonna take and we go to that it's gonna take all your strength to press into the peanut of God it's gonna take all of our effort right all of our human strength jesus said you must love it with all your strength and those who are part of the kingdom press into the kingdom of God that's why you're here tonight right pressing the kingdom of God you could be anywhere else well you're here to press in the kingdom of God and then jesus said the Apostles will be appointed a portion of that kingdom because they continued with Jesus and we actually our last scripture you read last week was second Thessalonians 1:5 we must be counted worthy of the kingdom so once you once you get the call of the kingdom you got to live a life worthy of the kingdom now let's look at the second part now that's when we turn a lot of scriptures tonight so have your Bibles handy let's start a revelation 11:15 no Wendy and I were talking about this between services but there's two kinds of kingdoms there's earthly kingdoms and then there's heavenly kingdoms so let's look at this scripture like we know like on the steel I'm sorry the Steel Curtain you know Russia right the bamboo curtain China and the purple curtain the Catholic Church two of those are physical right I guess you could argue mannequins both they gotta have a natural Kingdom and the atmosphere cioppino but those are all those are natural except vatican is the cage of unclean and hateful bird that's a spiritual peanut it's revelation 11:15 now this is a great scripture here and the seventh angel sounded and there were voices in Heaven's the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ he shall reign forever and ever so right now it's the kingdoms of this world all right the natural Pinos United States China Russia like we said and then the Vatican those are natural earthly kingdoms but then Jesus makes a peculiar statement in John 18:36 he's being questioned idly by Pilate Sir John 18:36 I just like to read it they don't have all these memorized to ask them are you the King of the Jews and then in verse let's go to John 1835 Pilate answered and said am ia Jew but no nation and the chief priests have delivered be unto me what has God done and jesus said My Kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence praise God so we see while there's earthly kingdoms the kingdom of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's actually from heaven praise God that's right amen it's from heaven jesus said My Kingdom is not of this world remember last week we also looked at how there's Jesus's Kingdom which were in right now but then there's the father's Kingdom which will be in the New Jerusalem praise God after the white throne judgment after everything's been settled all the enemies and the death is blasted and casted like a fire the Jesus presents delivers the kingdom back to the Father that may God that God may be all at all they may that's hard to explain but that's what the scripture says I can't fully explain that all the way now notice Church said the kingdom that we have now the Holy Ghost it used to be with the Jews but it wasn't the baptism of the soul so three day x16 so under the Old Testament the Jews had the kingdom of God but it wasn't yet to the soul x16 this is what the disciples are asking for they think and at least they're asking this without the Holy Ghost so they're still think you might it'll be like David's Kingdom and when Jesus you know the Jesus force us out it's going to be like Solomon's kingdom they actually in other words they were opened for the Millennium that's what they were hoping for it's a good x16 says when they therefore were come together they asked him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel so see they were thinking you know a David Kingdom a Solomon Kingdom what did Jesus say percent and he said that it is not for you to know the times of the season which the father had put in his own power they see they thought oh you know the kingdom of God is gonna be like that really soo but Jesus said no we're gonna take a 2000 year break amen we're going to bring sixty nine and a half years we're going to cut it off and press the pause button and I'm going to go and get a Gentile bride for my namesake all right God had a Kingdom with the Jews we said would applied them per season to preserve life amen I'm gonna go get me a Gentile bride now it's also Matthew 21 33 so that's we dare Jesus and that's surviving social so inspired some of these parables I've never seen them like this before remember there's 15 parables Jesus says if lady and I love this because this parable in particular because Jesus interprets this parable for Saint ahead there some parables he doesn't interpret for us but there are a few that he does one of you don't need interprets the wheat and the tares the four kinds of ground and here he interprets this and he shows that the kingdom of God was given to the Jews but then when the further part of the kingdom the Holy Ghost was going to cover that they turn it down they didn't want nothing to do with me so jesus said in that case I'm going to take the kingdom and I'm going to give it to another nation that'll bring forth the fruits of the Holy Spirit hey Matty 21 33 what a beautiful parable here huh he says here another parable there that's God which planted a vineyard and had to round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower let it out too high that's the Jews and went to a far country and with the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another and he sent another servant more than the first and they did likewise unto them also now that was like Jeremiah Isaiah and Ezekiel they beat them they stoned and they killed them right even John the Baptist is one of those we could say and then the last one and then verse pretty soon but last of all I said unto them his son saying they will reverence my son verse 38 when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard sea and slew him see they cast by the vineyard the Bible said he was slayed outside the gate he verse thirteen that he was crucified without the gate Amen so they kicked him out of Jerusalem and they crucified him uncle Gotha verse forty now when the Lord thereof of the vineyard cometh what will he do under those husbandmen they say then he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their season look these people are so far from the kingdom of God but yet they can understand Jesus simple parables they know they're the wicked ones my right because it says it later that they know he's talking about them so they could any man any sinner and he is remember the religious spirit is the worst one even a religious spirit can recognize that they're wicked yet they still will repent they may see that that shows they're worthy of a greater condemnation because they could judges perfectly they say the woman the husband was going to give it to somebody else that'll bring forth fruit jesus said that did you never read the scriptures now this is solves 1:18 the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and is it is marvelous in our eyes you haven't you this therefore I said to you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you he's talking to the chief priests and scribes and Pharisees see they've already got the kingdom of God over the Bible said they've got the key of knowledge but they they closed the door and they won't let anybody in the kingdom so see the law of God was that was they need to gather that because the law of God contained the prophecies on the New Testament am i right Ezekiel's brought all that to a Jew week we've had a qu that used to work at my class on Friday on Friday we I haven't seen her for my ten years and I just thought I'm gonna carry my book with me everywhere I go now so I can pass it out if I see a friend and we come across and she's a Jew she said hey how you doing I said I'm doing good but would you like this and I gave her a copy of my book and she's Jewish and you know I said there's a lot of good scriptures in here from the Old Testament because the Old Testament a New Testament I mentioned that Scripture I said because I was trying to explain to her how we're different from other churches I said well we're a holy ghost no Church and what's that mean I was like well there's kind of this most churches meet that they believe you're filled with God's Spirit as soon as you repent but I said that's not scriptural so I took her back to Z cos in Ezekiel 36 says you get a new heart a new spirit then my spirit I believe and I said we preach you got to press on and the things of God again believe Lena before God though she with nobody else but I she said I love a copybook and your side like yeah I don't really care to sign up it's the content that's in there that I want her to get to the content but even she could see that so the kingdom of God so see they had the keys to the kingdom all the promises were laying right in there Amos Jones prophecy about the Holy Ghost was right in totality amen it was right in there it was the kingdom of God the prophecy was like right in there they just would have kept the word it would have produced the Baptist with all the ghosts in their lives right but jesus said it's taken from you and given to a nation bringing for the fruits they're up oh and whosoever shall follow this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind into powder now picture this remember go back to Daniel to remember when Jesus comes as a stone about it he's gonna fall on the mother harmony then if the stone falls on you you're going to be killed but if you fall on the stone you'll be saved in other words if you throw yourself on the heads of God say God I've nothing if you throw yourself on the heads of God don't break your stony heart up I'll give you a new heart of flesh that's right it's one of the other we've got to throw herself on the mercy of God amen using the one of the other I guess that's why the Bob would want leap of faith I've never seen that before - right now there's your leap of faith throw yourself through your old stony heart up on Christ and I'll break up all your stony heart I'll get you new I never seen that before there it is that's where people get that wrong amen glory go grind to the powder that's what the Bible said as soon as in Daniel - that stone slowed it the image at the feet would represent the end times it went as spread like chaff and just divide it up and broke up into chaff that the wind blew it away just like that powder this little piece is totally dispersed verse 45 and when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard this parables they perceived that he spake of them see they knew they could judge the farewell they can understand the parable but they couldn't receive it they couldn't obey it amen but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a profit Oh glory now everybody see that there's two kinds of kingdoms earthly heavenly the heavenly kingdom was with the Jews but then they rejected it and so it came to the Gentiles praise God a church it is preaching that calls you to the king baby boy go to acts 28 30 actually it is preaching so it's a good sign here in the kingdom here's a great she game ahead because the Bible said all preach the kingdom of God amen acts 28 30 this is a beautiful scripture and then the Paul's life right before he gets a martyred God opens up a little time of rest where he gets a little house an apartment to rent and he and the God just says that all these people did for him to do Bible studies with amen God is so gracious verse 30 and Paul wrote two whole years in his own hired house and receive all that came in unto him so Paul all done at least three memory to three missionary trips right and never he labored more with all the other apostles none of them make three trips like he did and he went further than all I'm not sure who than Thomas but he made more than Thomas he the three trips and at the end of his life for the kingdom of God's sake he gets arrested and then since he can't go up God sends him in amen oh that's how it is for us if we can't go out God send them in a night sense souls that you hear your word verse 31 preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no man forbidding him so see there's preaching which program says demonstrating the power of God and then there's teaching to get you settled to give you a foundation for the brand causing a basis to give you a basis or foundation so you're not talking about so you know where you stand amen Preeti 82 and remember he was the first church age messenger he's the one we're all supposed to look at and try to imitate him that's right glory first Thessalonians 2 let's go there to verse 11 first Thessalonians 2 11 as you know how we exhorted and comfort and charge every one of you as a father Dustin's children so see how an apostille an apostle will preach like a dad right so it's been a while since beyond apostle here is maximally D but they never go to start this church you'd say would have been the apostle now it really didn't work like that so if they did they would act like a father they would speak kind of as from a father to children and the Bible says that they would exhort comfort and charge each one of you okay verse 12 that he would walk worthy of God who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory amen so Paul preached the gospel I'm sorry Paul preached the kingdom and that preaching was the invitation to be a part of the kingdom and to also share in the glory of the kingdom amen another video remember touch we're not just talking to any place let's remember this let's not forget this we're not just going to be a part be around the key to work on the sit in the throne with Christ in the kingdom amen we've got the highest calling in the Bible to be the Bride of Christ to sit with him in his throne oh yes see were called to the kingdom remember the order the order of predestination is first for now so God foreknew you'd want to be a part of the kingdom and then he predestined the events so you could hear the word of God and then he called you to the kingdom amen so he foreknew you he predestinated you and then he calls you and after he calls you he justifies you on this earth and then promised to glorify you give you a glorified body amen that's the order of Romans 8:28 229 first for now it's been predestination then your calling she were called to the kingdom and then he justified you heart of the kingdom that he glowered then will glorify you with a new glorified body all right hallelujah now I want you to see again how urgent Christ was with the kingdom of God for Luke 4 verse 42 we looked at it last Sunday morning remember some of those man that would have been a part of the seventy they had one chance invitation just what and look at the urgency again I believe it's the same today I'll be the holy spirit of like when you witness to your friends when I witness the friends I believe some of them just have one chance to get it other people you know God's more merciful to give some more chances but some people may just have one chance Luke 4 42 now Jesus just casts out a bunch of Devils to rebuked them and did great miracles if I was that He healed all kinds of diversity diseases in verse 40 number 42 and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people saw him and get him unto Him and and stayed him that he should not depart from them and he said them I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also for therefore am I sent and he preached in the synagogue's of Galilee so Jesus didn't stay long in some places because the kingdom of God needed to be preached other places praise God and so brother Graham was the same way he said he told them that the Brandon Tabernacle he said I I won't be here much longer the gospel must be preached elsewhere you know he'd have to that and that started where this listen to today that started after he got confirmation from the angel in 46 after he got that confirmation he made a promise to God Lord if you start discerning these visions and discerning people I'll take this gift throughout in the world and he kept his promise amen because the kingdom the gospel needed to preach other places praise God now here it's going to loop a since right there now in this kingdom that Jesus was preaching when the kingdom touched people's lives those people that had touched supported that kingdom I'm trying to courage you tonight and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout Luke 8:1 every city and village preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom and the twelve were with him and certain women which has been healed the people spirits and infirmities Mary called Magdalene out of whom instead of devils and Joanna the son of chuza Herod's servant and Susanna and many others which minister in the hint of their substance praise God so whenever the kingdom of God touches you if you're got a true heart you'll support that can with all you got hey sorry so that's what they did the kingdom touch then the kingdom cleansed out then so they said I'm going to support that Kingdom amen I'm going to forget about my previous life at the master Okita I'm going to support the spiritual kingdom of God amen now go to second Peter 1:11 now let's now move here to the the Holy Ghost Kingdom now verdict for the Jen's house because this is the stature perfect man chapter ii peter 1:11 and this kind of gets into the glorified part of the kingdom so right now church were the justified part of the kingdom right we're justified before God we're forgiven but our bodies are not yet glorified but we got a glorified body waiting at the throne of God amen so see that's where we're at we know God's for notice he predestinated us he caught us but right now we're living in a justified position waiting for the glorification of these bodies and when we did let's say we cross over we cross over for the rapture then we'll enter into the what the scripture says here second Peter 1:11 now the Bible says if you let all of the virtues and all the character traits of Jesus growing you and it comes forth abundantly and Android shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ see so right now by the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God is within you but the Bible says if you're faithful unto death and you let the fullness of Christ go into you then that entrance will be made into the glorified part of the kingdom in other words the sixth dimension as we know with message believers the six dimension glory see that entrance into that Kingdom where everybody's glorified in a glorified body Lord Alleluia I want everybody to see that there by the grace of the Lord see so this is speaking of the sixth dimension of the course of the millennium that's his kingdom where the kingdom is where everybody's going on everybody's reach that by the stage amen now this is what it's for the kingdom now for us and they go back to the Holy Ghost Romans 14:17 let's read that you know Paul's dealing with people who are are taking their Christian liberties some are some are eating meat some are not some are meeting eating only herbs now that he should I do this should I do that but Paul's trying to show the difference between all these Christian liberties well some keep the holy day some keep this day only some day is that holy now Paul's trying to balance this Psalm out Romans 14:17 you know he says his main thing is that we're all going to give an account to God in verse 12 and 13 the main thing is don't cause others to stumble so listen if you've got the kingdom of God within you you're gonna build people up not tear them down praise God a real Holy Ghost filled Christian will not put a stumbling block in somebody's way and say well I can live however they want I don't care what they think no we should care what other people think right don't put a stumbling block in your brother's way don't grieve him with meat and verse 15 number 16 then let not your good be evil spoken of either them so it's okay to touch somebody well I have this conviction because I think this is good verse 17 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost amen right this is what the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is not about the natural things it's about the spiritual things amen I've enjoyed a piece and all the fruits of the Holy Spirit that's we need that glory you see how rare joy is that today career is joy how many people do you know actually I'm joy I went back to the dry cleaners yesterday and she said again you're just so happy why are you so happy they just I just you can send it to me yesterday people Jesus Christ you know he's my lord he's my Savior these are things that we should constantly have people should see the kingdom of God is within us amen go to first Corinthians 4 verse 20 the next book now we touched on this earlier with Paul people preached and taught the kingdom of God Paul says the same thing in 1st Corinthians 4 verse 20 now Paul and verse 19 is talking up preachers had to come into their church but they were puffed up with pride and they only had words of pride there was puffed up but verse 20 says for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power so a lot of times you'll see that with people that have bought doctrine they really don't have any power behind their ministries right God's not vindicating their word amen I love that what God comes around and indicates the word that's what we live for amen thank God is showing I'm with you in power praise God see look at verse 21 what will he show I come unto you with the rod or in love and the spirit of meekness now of course he did all that right he came in meekness he came to love and him with a rod of Correction because the next chapter he starts rebuking the man that was sleeping with his stepmother so see the kingdom of God comes in power miracles but also in love and correction and meekness as well praise God all right now let's get to this one here this is where you and I can be greatly helped you're encouraged go to Matthew 5 let's look at the Beatitudes I remember I preached a few summers on this but I can't remember how many I preached on in just a couple braise the Lord now Jesus goes of course on the Sermon on the Mount verse 2 and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven praise God now look at verse 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven so twice he says theirs is the kingdom of heaven those who are poor in spirit and those who are persecuted for righteousness sake praise God now in the Greek poor means to be crouch I like this the crouch down it actually means a beggar now another suppose my man said we're not beggars we're not paupers but church there are times we decry to God like we're pleading with God right I understand that and we got to be careful not to lose not to let that become frie because there's quotes you can take where a son of God is way higher than an angel but we've got to eat that's true but remember we can't speak anything of our own selves we got to be led by the Holy Spirit yes I believe the blood makes us son of God dog up higher than an angel but don't go bragging and acting like you're something now you're puffed up you can only say what God tells you to say so lesson are the poor in spirit not in soul in spirit so in your mind blessed are the those who crouched and are beggarly in their minds that means pauper that's what it means in the Greek but there are paupers in their spirit in other words less than of those who are humble right blessed are those who are tiny that's of those who are needy Amen I say like this it's like the deer panting for water see because it's crouching a deer has to crouch to get the water Hey reminds us of Gideon fact the guys that crouched down and had their eyes on the enemy that's who God willing to fight for maybe the head glory blessed are the poor in spirit those who crouched those who humble themselves in their spirits and they bow down and they're thirsty for the things of God because theirs is the kingdom of God the baptismal Holy Ghost amen so who's going to get the Holy Ghost those who are crouching those who are hopeful those who are hungry and thirsting for righteousness ain't he says it just a few more verses the Lord Jesus does yeah hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled that's verse 6 that's right so see he gives the same thought just a little different angle so people can understand it it's hard to find humble people but you and I are called to be humble and we need to be panting and crouching for water like the deer pants for the water that's right and then an arse of the kingdom when were persecuted right made fun of and mocked in and rejected ours is the kingdom of heaven it's a promise praise God now let's go to Matthew 5:19 there's a lot about the kingdom of having this chapter whosoever therefore shall break one of the least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven so see there there's two aspects to this you teach it wrong and then you don't live the word that makes you the least in the kingdom of heaven reverse but let's finish immersion but whosoever shall do and teach them amen the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven hi there for I said to you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes the Pharisees ye shall no case enter into the kingdom of heaven Ava Oh Lord what makes you great in the kingdom of God when you live what you preach amen what you now say like this when you live what is preached to you now me I've got to live what I preach but you gotta if you're not a preacher you gotta you gotta live what's preached to you right and those who are called great in the kingdom of God live what they preach amen Lord and the Bible says not to offend the little children that I miss that one or that must be a different scripture yeah yeah we got it that's right you don't teach the little ones so always teach those children the right thing about but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he Wow some of you choked on that right sometimes we choked on this scripture yeah I think you raise your hand say sometimes I choked on that waiter let me give you a little more insight I heard this this is from my new ministry but man talked about John the Baptist the angel told my man if you'll be sincere and stay humble keep way for money and stuff then I'll just keep blessing you and you'll keep climbing remember said many times we look at men who climb up in great ranks like and get high names but sometimes that's not what God calls high you remember John when he came preaching the Bible foretold said every mountain will be brought low and every low place would be lifted up see and when it comes you think it would be coming out of heaven with fiery chariots like the other elijah prophet said no but what was it but a poor man dressed in a piece of sheepskin wrapped around him and out on the banks of Jordan preaching on the muddy banks not even in a church but God saw that great hey muddy banks he's got multiple over his feet he's got a wet sheepskin because he's baptized and so many people this is greatest person in the Old Testament praise God but man keeps this is silver let's quote and when Jesus said recycles that there wasn't one born of a woman as great as John the Baptist prevention you take all the Kings and David the Prophet and all of his great splendour in Solomon that didn't even touch John the Baptist he said Lord because they haven't think beautiful rose they were a beautiful rose and then all this money and their beautiful stone that walked on it and other are the five minions and all the beautiful things but program says all that beauty couldn't touch a man anointed with the Elijah's spirit with mud all over his feet and locusts all up in his teeth mine must have lost unless he's follow them home and he's all wet soaking wet saying repent my man said David saman couldn't touch John the Baptist he said so John didn't even have a place to lay his head so you don't have to be rich you might in this world to be great the sign of God you all have to be humble in your heart so who is for overlaying that David Solomon or John the Baptist my man said John the Baptist was more humble because he didn't have a place to lay his head brother William remember David Simon they all build themselves big houses did you on the Baptist build himself a big house his message is too important do we thank God for David Solomon yes I just tell you what the Bible says yeah Jesus says John the Baptist is greater than all the women all the men born women before him and God calls that greatness he's that great enough to Humble himself by being so great he could humble himself and go out in the wilderness and stand alone and preach the gospel a day and do the whole of ministry instead of compromising to go preach with the Pharisees and Sadducees Goren and brother bang the mountains were brought down low and denominationalism an agreed in there it was all brought down by the preaching of repent the kingdom of God is at hand amen gourry he said that's a great person that'll take the blame for anything that humble himself that's greatness now Church you know the scripture we all fall shrug lord god john the baptist i don't think is there a sin recorded against him in the Bible I just thought of that I can't think of one sin record against John the Baptist in the bottom but yet we know he had the phone short of the glory of God at some point IOC would have been the Messiah oh he doubted yet he doubted Jesus there there's one record yeah thank you lord that's all I can think of but he stood there against Herod he stood against Herodias program said he didn't do it because he hated them he did it because he loves them he rebuked them because he loved them he says that's greatness John chose humanity rather than greatness so the church honey one that how could you be great that he know God humble yourself and serve other people be poor in spirit say God in my mind I'm weak in my mind lord give me your strength to my mind I'm coming to you Lord I'm hungry and thirsty behind the soap overwhelm who quit with cares of the world Lord I just come Lord I'm just hungered and thirsted give me some fresh to start my mind amen I'm poor in spirit yet but also a more spirit than the kingdom of God's by Lord see it's a mine my mind is not as strong as I wanted to be so bored I'm coming to you hungry and thirsty anoint my mind transformed by my we do love our Lord oh I love that quote I just think that yesterday that's glory that's glorious David it's Amon and all their splendor couldn't even touch John the Baptist no what about you because the Bible said he's at least in the kingdom of God and no mercy that's that's a joker anybody give water after that Chokin anybody in one of the have somebody go get you some water now to church why is that it comes down to this because the Holy Ghost is in the soul of man because David as great as he was he still lusted into another man's wife right still had a man killed committed adultery and then married what he had 300 concubines her he's at 5-under wives and the Bible said four kings not to take unto themselves many wives the Bible God warned them in Deuteronomy still great man he's still mad after God's own heart but he wasn't the greatest John the Baptist but listen John I just did just stroking there John turned down getting married all for what to be the forerunner of Jesus Christ also we can handle and hold the word man flashing all the other ones talked about all those talking about John baptized him judge separates over thirty years they men for six months of ministry and he turned down houses he turned out Lance wife children he turned all that down so he could fall run the Messiah and there's not a greater than John the Baptist in the Old Testament but it was so humble so humble didn't look great but it was great in the sight of God Laurie and so you and I when we're born again are greater than that because now we've got it in our soul praise God that's the only way I can see it it has to be that way because Jesus says the Holy Ghost could not be till Jesus was glorified praise God so the least in the kingdom is greater than John now we'll always have the attitude that were not as great as John right we always want to be humbled but according to Jesus in your soul you've got a greater blessing than what they have the Old Testament right because the kingdom of God is now within you so he won't be like Solomon's Solomon syndrome of backsliding as you get older and set a backside you'll be more dedicated to God right like Jesus said member the secret of Christianity he said your last works were more than your first oh yeah that's the secret of Christianity you labor more for God the older you get you get more dedicated more consecrated if you're not sure it's time to check up it's time to get rise see you first the kingdom of God amen and His righteousness get back on track because this is the secret of the Holy Ghost it's a concept burning fire like like you said on Wednesday night it's expanding why amen it's gonna take more and more of your life amen it's gonna consume more Amore's it's growing but you gotta be flexible like God now we're talking about that inter-service that was the word instructor on Wednesday flexible we gotta be flexible if the Holy Spirit says move and serve me in a greater ways we've got to do it because light expands the Holy Ghost expands and never slugs that it expands to all of our all of our life Laurie I've never seen like that thank the Lord you enjoyed this I love that John the Baptist's Chris there's something about that mother so glorious hallelujah humble humility porn spirit I need more of God I'm crouching before God Laura I lay my life before I'm a living sacrifice I crucify the license affections they're up I set my affections on heaven fill my heart with your spirit fill my heart with the things of God Lord I Church you know this unrepentant hearts will not inherit the kingdom of God we have to go through this but I got a Brit down here there's one two three there's four scriptures on it first Corinthians six collations five and these five at first Corinthians 15 says that those who do such sins will not inherit the people of God so that's what I'm going to write in the next book with the the kingdom of the holy ghost chapter God gives us a perfect line of the sand you cannot say you're sanctified and commit adultery because you're not you cannot say you got the Holy Ghost and commit abomination like fornication or murderer right you cannot murder say you got the Holy Ghost amen another word search God gives us a river Jordan once we cross the river Jordan will never go back to those Egypt's in take that right those wilderness sins so if God gives us a line of sand if you do these things without repentance you will not inherit the kingdom of God amen so there's so many I think there was 23 on this at one time I preached it one time and showed each one by the Greek and I got a video on it if you go to that video the three works of grace I think it's a two-part series on YouTube I've gone through all 23 of those and you can see each one and there's things like divide churches you know there's things like money laundering you know there's off are there's so many clues to let people know ordering it or not if they just read this Holy Bible right we've just got to be more interested in this than we are the other things of the world oh I'm interested in this right here this is what I'm interested in right here praise God Nathan now see unrepentant heart will not will not inherit it to see that bruise the foolish virgin has to repent of all that now at least repent of it they made you they may commit those sins with no repent of it because they will inherit a force for the kingdom of God not the city but they'll be outside now Brooke would know John 3 verse 3 this is why people can't find a home church this is why they can't support a local church they can't understand why church is so important but Jesus tells us plainly you got to give order to get you cannot see or understand God's kingdom until you're born again just on the church no sorna it's a kingdom amen it's establishing the Dominion on earth amen this is a foretaste of Kingdom divine a men oh yeah that's right church thank you though we're kings of Greece verse 3 Jesus answer sent him verily verily I say to you except a man be born again he cannot see he cannot understand the kingdom of God yes Nicodemus says of him how can a man be born when he's old help me enter the same time in his mother's womb to be born jesus answered verily verily I say to you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot the air of the kingdom of God amen hallelujah now it goes to knocks off the wind you don't know where it's coming don't know where it's going no doubt about that I'm not gonna emphasize that but I want to emphasize that's why people get so tired of a message churches or any church that's why they fall out because if they got bored again they would know that angels are here recording your thoughts and your thoughts are in heaven are other than your words on earth Lord they're here recording and this they're reporting to the Father about who's really a part of the kingdom of God who's working for the kingdom of God amen because the next life is just an echo of this life right because John was so humble and faithful he had a he was the greatest of the Old Testament kingdom it was so humble heaven was watching them in church heavens watching you and Alec today to see this is more than just church smothers together this is God's rule Haven this is God's dimension on earth and the great ones are the ones who do it and to each of others amen they hear the word they do it and then they teach other people to do it as well oh that's right church that's right and that beautiful by it makes so much sense now the kingdom of God that's why people can't see it they can't see coming to sit in church here in the Word of God ran a fastener or you don't pray for the Holy Ghost they can't see it because they don't want to understand it they've got other things that are more important that's right they've got other things they won't repent of this that's the trouble because if not they would inherit the kingdom of God now just approved again go to Matthew 25:34 the foolish virgin do have a place in the kingdom because there's six things number 6 is the number of anointed man to be bald men but it's also anointed man for the Rams folks six squirrels into existence and then on the seventh I'm he just spoke it to be there where you can find it but he said sexy but RAM said that was the number of man God gave him confirmation with six squirrels he says that quote I think I shared it with you and through 25:34 just I just want to bring this out because this is a good Kingdom Scripture 25:34 then shall the King say to them on the right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so they had they inherit a place to live in side the kingdom but these are not kings and priests these are just those who get to live in the kingdom yeah because this for verse 25 I was hungry and you gave me meat I was thirsty you gave me drink I was stranger you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you missed me I was in prison he came to me hey it just struck me this is why their foolish version they just did these physical acts of physical ruling or physical health but in but in Revelation 7 where there's a Gentile bride with palms the Bible says they are part of the kingdom because they're wash their garments white in the blood of Jesus Christ those Gentile bride were fully forgiven and they went to the fountain it was blood they in other words they had the full atonement praise God hey the brothers will have the full effects of the atonement of the blood of Christ but the Jewish version does it she turns down the blood so she gets there by being good to the people who represent the blood oh man that's right Church look at that six ways they can get anointed in six different ways and if they do a good thing to the bride does people they get eternal life they're blessed of the father to inherit the kingdom and now looks her seat all beautiful see how they're surprised right here by they men they're surprised what do you mean see they could have seen the kingdom I said what do you mean we're saying remember Jesus said unless you're born again you can't see the kingdom so they did nice aggressions not even really knowing what they were doing to the kingdom of God because they weren't born again they couldn't see the kingdom see but we know that we are God in flesh work manifesting God in our flesh they can't see the kingdom of God they can't see that the kingdom of God is God hiding himself in simplicity behind a many number bride oh thank you see the bush version of standing there you know oh I'm surprised I'm safe but the Bible said the bride is already on the throne revelation 3:21 see we're not standing there like oh but it's something good for Jesus we know that we see the kingdom of God we see with the Holy Ghost solid eyes finishing the Great Commission thank you this gospel to every nation they are you and I taking it to our family members taking this city take it to every will hear the word of God revelation 3:21 Tim it overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne see these foolish virgin didn't overcome anything all they did was show a little love to the product they couldn't see the kingdom of God but Jesus says to the overcomers they sit right here with me they don't stand out there with all those goats and everything like that he said they're right here by me grace God and there's more than one scripture about down that first 15-6 says the Saints will judge the earth see these white throne judgment they're getting judged by their works but the bride judges the earth by her testimony like the Queen of Sheba praise God she's the one being used her life judges those who didn't obey the kingdom of God now Revelation 20 verse 4 this is a good one a church this about the most humbling scripture I've seen in a long time the other one major rejoice where Jesus says that he this least the kingdom is greater the judge that made me rejoice that saying actually that's quite all they do but this one just as humbling verse 4 revelation 20 verse 1 and I saw Thrones and they sat on them and judgment was given then they they settlement choice may given to them remember the Bible said the Saints should judge angels will judge the fallen demons that's why the next studies no one did I found a good book and it lists all the spirits in the Bible like the spirit of slumber the spirit of fear the spirit of infirmity all these spirits out I want to look I want to go through every one of those so we can be over commerce praise God if we preach on those spirits it'll teach us to have spiritual warfare events so we'll know if the spirit produces but we always know how to overcome I Jesus speak the word obey the word speak the word in any tribe but it's good to identify those demon powers now this is so beautiful look and I saw Vincey verse 4 and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus look at this church and for the word of God those Jews and Christians Jews that got the Holy Ghost and which had not worshipped the Beast neither His image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years look how humbling this is Church if we're really the bride if the Bible's right and all these programs interpretations right we're going to be up there God sees our life on the same level as those who got beheaded like st. Paul that's about that makes me feel about that big God's got a place up there all the overcomers if they just turn down the Beast and they overcome the Beast in their lifetime overcome that Kingdom by God's kingdom amen they turned down that kingdom of another harlot and they give their lives all eyes to the kingdom of God they get the sit on the same throne as those beheaded like st. Paul nah whatever water church what are we were for eternity just turning down the things of this world just turning it down safety amazing we reward the Bible offers us how many believe that think about that our lives you serve the same reward as those beheaded for Christ because we go overcome the Beast let's close with this Matthew 20 verse 1 let's go to this last parable Brady Scott Arab 11 tower workers 20 verse 1 most of us know the story here but you know Jesus you know the Bible tells us that the the husband went out at the first hour the third hour the six hour the ninth hour that should have been the last one be said I'm going to go out one more time at the eleventh hour my name is Greg say man there it is I can see that glory because there's really only those four divisions in the day but he's not going to have breaks their necks amen I'm having grace I'm about wool or olive he's remember they're in three our divisions right what 1st 3rd 6 9 9 ship in the last one but he said I'm gonna have Grace and I'm gonna have a fifth call for those 11th hour workers now program says that we are the 11th hour workers because of World War one ending an 11th month 11th hour and God giving more grace that the world wasn't destroyed so I that seems to be right I believe that that's Morris but now what's interesting though is that when they call the labourers in verse 8 they Bible said they call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first so Jesus gives those people that worked one hour compared to 12 right how many worked a 12-hour day before I did a couple of times that's no fun thank God I don't have to do it very often twelve hours and this church art works right now as hard as theirs out in the field okay right so the 12-hour workers come up with like what do you mean I'm behind the ones that worked one hour and they start complaining yes now I need to study this out of warm and it kind of seems like the Jews complaining like the Jews you know what you're harder times than I don't know I'm not sure but my map says we're allowed not work or something stay with that one but look at that they start complaining if I wasn't a murderer against Christ cuz they labor twelve but the one who labor one got their reward first and they thought well I should get more but they got a penny I should get more than a penny and they murmured a verse 11 verse 12 saying these last have wrought for one hour and that was made them each one to us which have formed the burden and heat of the day they got mad what do you mean how can they be equal with us verse 13 but he answered one of them and said friend I do thee no wrong this not thou agree with me for a penny what was the ingredient when they started working the agreement is one penny the agreement was for eternal life the one penny the one life a night there's only one life away the truth they all agreed for one penny one form of life some work longer for some work through a harder time for it but God said Electric Gunson friend I dunno do you know Rome look at verse 14 take that thine is and go my way I will give unto this last even as unto thee look at verse 15 is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own is thine eye evil because I'm good it's got a good God or see a mean God easily God now if you go back to the parable Jesus says eleventh are workers why aren't you working he's that no man is calling us sorry in other words never could hear the calls till now amen I wish our God all that time I woulda made but I never could hear the call so right now even and you're not would've stood during the times of all we would have stood during times of Peter we wouldn't start the day tomorrow Luther but that wasn't the time for us to hear the call our time is right now I got one hour and the Sun is setting it's not as hot as other times but we've got the labor this last hour and Jesus said I'll reward the last version because this is the most wicked of deceptive age also that evil seducers will wax worse and worse even in other words today please the discernment of the Holy Ghost more than ever before we need to see the kingdom of God believe the kingdom of God and labor for the people of God because it's an age of deception people think they see the kingdom of God that they don't what kind of life is gonna sit by these that were beheaded those that did not worship the Beast the denominational system those who chose the worship Christ in this hour alone I remember this parable is right after Jesus when Peter said Peter said Jesus lead left all what do we get he said I promised you a hundredfold in this life for the life to come amen and yes he ends that chapter 19 by saying many she'll be the first should be last last should be first many are called but few are chosen see there's a certain group that was chosen for the eleventh hour and then you're the four because they put it right there but when they showed up they were called for such a time as this amen they were called to work one hour with all of our hearts and Jesus said you get the same reward because I promised eternal life for everyone glory so these are all them for seco whether you work 12 hours 9 6 3 or 1 any minute you all agree I'm feeling it I'm good I'm a good guy I'll be give everybody one reward eternal life praise God let's do our beef as we're standing think about this who knows how many years Jonathan I'm sorry Jonathan divine labor anyway no 66 years he preached the gospel praise God 66 years he died in a hundred years old he got the Holy Ghost in a t-33 with nobody ghosts fell and he lived for 66 years that's according to history she imagined 66 years worth of ministry for the kingdom of God who knows how many years Stephen the first martyr lived he loved 29 years history says well the way he was 29 years old what the Bible said he was full of faith the Holy Ghost Lord Church he only served one year for the kingdom of God 1 here John lived 66 but you think you think John's going to get a greater or more than Stephen oh my it was Stephens testimony was so great at 29 years old that Jesus stood up to receive him into heaven he said I see Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father amen to receive in one year brother William verses 66 and it's just like this parable whether it's one year one hour or 12 hours get the same reward seekers God has to have testimonies them in their 20s look here's a 29 year old man who got the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God and he wouldn't turn it down even die for it hey that John was a man a hundred years old and he's in the goin hands all those people that sell out God at the end of their lives see a hundred year old man can live that's the power of the kingdom of God evening and that beautiful musicians let's come here by God's grace praise God Church is not about how long you work it's not about how hard your life is it's about did you do the work
