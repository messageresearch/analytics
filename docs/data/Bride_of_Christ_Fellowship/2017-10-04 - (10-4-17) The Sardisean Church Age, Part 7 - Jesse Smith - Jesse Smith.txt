[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like to go back to the church ages tonight back to the book of life okay Revelation chapter 3 about how important it is to go slowly on a topic so pardon me I really enjoy going sober sometimes I feel like with is it my boat too slow but I wanted to show you something practice it it's so important at times to go slow so I just wanna show that boundaries Revelation chapter 3 verse relation three five and six praise God I read verse five and then we call e46 he's overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment I will not blot out his name but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels let's all read verse six one two three either happening here they didn't hear what the spirit

and praise though we just pray Lord our lives of these so worthy the gospel or God that you would not not on our names Florida that you would invest our days before your father we love you give you praise in Jesus Christ [Music] when I look at part seven our text here focus on focusing still in the book of life let me go through these benefits of teaching verse by verse willing to share do you think's here that the Prophet said about the benefits are going verse by verse now this is from the message of seven churches in 1954 this was quite a while before he preached the second teacher changes but look what he says here is you're getting ready to preach this message needs to bring your Bible long and in your pencil paper we and you want to take down scriptures that you just don't think that's just exactly right right here little note and put it on for the next night so I like that brother Graham was always open to questions I want to be that way to our boys try to be that way if there's anything I said that was wrong please let me know I try to share or maybe I feel like that was the when teaching program said I remember staying a year and six months just in the book of Revelation in the tabernacle here that's what I like he said in teaching I just love teaching oh my I think it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the church like that so it gives you a foundation on the scripture praise the Lord and this is interesting it on the adoption series he preached for sermons on the adoption series in 1960 and it's kind of on the book of Ephesians like we've been you just got back into on Sunday program just to be reading verses four or five which you can read on Sunday they said watch this master teacher Paul the first thing he does is knock out all the idea fall in the way knock out all the idea of ever being a Christian things mom gone the next day God be dead me and the next day I'm back again that's nonsense this book is not addressed to an evangelistic teaching evangelist service he said we don't I don't touch this on the fields I bring this to the church where Paul addresses it to the sings those that are caught and preserved in our film and our set aside and are in the Holy Spirit already in canyons life so if you see what brother Graham saying like I'll address this letter to the Saints and Paul getting Rugrats and I can't teach this out one of the advantages I'm only there one service right there Global Services yeah he said I only way I can teach this what Paul did verse by verse is to be in the local church amen and he said I love teaching the Word of God this is for solid believers this is for everybody who's solid and Christ who's already crossed Jordan into the Promised Land amen he said he's all trying to tell them the first thing is get get it out of your mind that you're going to get lost and you're gonna do this and you're scared of this don't be scared of it where he's trying to tell you where you're at who you are and understanding don't you agree that you know let me preach on occasions or other scriptures it tells you you're already in heavenly places it tells you you already child of God does they remind you of your position in Christ he said now you ought to do things and are now you might not do things wrong I'm sorry I said you might do things wrong and every time you do it anything wrong you're going to get paid for it yes sir you reap what you sow but that adds about one thing to do with your salvation when you're going scared of God you got your life and you can no more die than God you can die you're a part of God you're a son of God I like that remember the Bible said Paul said wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling so God God knows our salvation and when we look at God's plan we know we'll never be lost but Paul says while you're out here on earth if your attention to him make sure you're living the red life check up every hour right work on to your salvation with fear and trembling now I want to uh just go to this scripture real quick I just had this on my mind to write here Hebrews five and I just want to read these this I'm singing of these scriptures here for one a time you ought to be teachers you had need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful on the word of righteousness for he's a baby I like this strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so a real mature Christian who can handle the meat of the word is able to have the discernment of the Holy Spirit to recognize good and evil even is most deceptive forms right the Prophet talked about God missing evil age and how even how can overcome the Randstad the the the Christian is one who can recognize Satan and every one of his tricks and that's when you know you becoming a real solid Christian you can discern just little irreverent attitudes or real little small things that enter the walk with the Lord now look at the very next scripture I thought that was really good but I'm sorry before I move that would know we ought to be so deep in the Word of God that we could teach others my mother's you could teach your children right you're so deep in the word you're so deep in the word you can teach somebody else about the church age it's got to say that or the seven seals are or the water baptism or the God then keeping the word that we can teach others pause it if not then we need to go back and learn those things again right because those are we say note or beginning doctrines right and so we want to be able to do that now sisters don't teach like publicly but like I said they teach sugar or they testify right now look at chapter six verse one tells us what eat the milk doctrines are then upon leaving the principles of doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works you're just getting saved just repenting you should have left you should repent of that custom you should a repentant of that makeup wearing or you know - maybe you can apply these more simply that's a very milk doctrine right and I'll pay toward God you need to have faith in God not trust in the world or trust in money or trust in jobs you're not faith in God right the doctrine of baptisms there was a baptism in water and the fact is with the Holy Ghost amen the leg on at hand that's a helmet very doctrine if you're sick call upon the elders of the church have a lay hands on you praise the Lord and on the resurrection of the Dead we're all going to be raised some day right you're either in the first resurrection the rapture or the second resurrection that goes to the white and I'm judgment and of eternal judgment right we're all those who are lost we'll be eternally judged right there will be a judgment that last eternally at some point they'll come to annihilation but that judgment that they were that they were unworthy with everlasting life unworthy of eternal life we'd say that judgment lasts eternally that's right and all sin will go on into deeper things if God will prevent us I'm going to say God permit us to go on a deeper things that's a night I'd say tonight by God's grace and bro dad told us how to do that he said you go you said go through the scripture it's like you can reread there go through and get them get them a foundation get them settled in the Word of God all right let's go here now let's go back to the churches here now we left off at the two things being blotted out last Wednesday Dan and Ephraim remember that and we looked at how idolatry we have it with idolatry medicine is not free so very much but it's a huge problem because people will worship all kinds of things and the Prophet told us in Deuteronomy 29 that's where God pronounces that names will be removed because of idolatry and I and we showed how there's a type of the first thing they did with idolatry in the days of Raya Boehm and Jeroboam they cut the people from going to church we saw that last Wednesday and that they built up an idol and that's what we see today people will leave the house of God and they'll set up idols now what I found amazing is that because of their idolatry these two tribes missed the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't know if you caught this as you read the book or not but Dan and Ephraim are missing in Revelation 7 4 so let's go there well I guess I'll just go there right here revelation 7 4 we'll just do that right here might as well I'll save milk or let's say Malachi from going back over revelation 7 for this is quite a thought I thought as I read this this is kind of what jumped out to me and I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes that showed of Israel of the tribe of juda were sealed 7 or 12,000 the tribe of Reuben sealed 12,000 of the tribe of GAD sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Asher sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Neff talam were sealed 12,000 the tribe of Manasseh we're CEO 12-thousand tribe of Simeon or C 12,000 of the tribe of Levi were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Issachar were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 and the tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 amen now look Dan and Ephraim are replaced by Joseph and Benjamin and they do not get born again because of idolatry what uh what that was a striking thought to me because as I said I put up there this proves those who allow idols in their lives cannot be born again because God doesn't let Dan and Ephraim get born again all because of idolatry and look at this hosea was written in 786 between this and 746 BC and that's when God actually pulled their names off the book that's when they started idolatry Hosea said leave Dan alone he's joined with idols this means God was going to blot out their names from under heaven for around 2800 years and counting can you imagine that almost 3,000 years God has kept their names off the book of life under heaven now this is quite a thought and I don't quite understand this but that's what the scripture tells us now it seems God has mercy upon the two tribes because their idolatry was under the Old Testament but I think you and I understand under the New Testament I doubters will not inherit the kingdom of God there is no inheritance frye doubters because that's what it says in 1st Corinthians 6:9 and Ephesians 5:5 idolaters will not inherit the kingdom of God so church and this is why I said I don't understand this so bear with me I can't explain this perfectly but the Bible says somehow by the grace of God the two tribes show back up in the Millennium now can you get a picture of this dan and Ephraim have tribes today but their names are not on the book of life because of idolatry still today but somehow the rapture is going to go and then during the tribulation Dan and Ephraim will not be born again the Holy Ghost now this is under this is striking I can't explain it and then number what happens after that there's fire because in the Millennium the righteous walk upon the ashes of the wicked remember that from Malachi chapter 3 I'm sorry chapter 4 so somehow the tribes of Dan and Ephraim live through the tribulation period and then in the Millennium their names are put back on the book of life I can't explain that church and I don't know but remember there's a lot about the millennium and future home we can't understand right because remember the Bible said about the Millennium that a child will die a hundred years old remember that preach on that a few years ago I think it was just last year preach on the millennium a child will die a hundred years old and then remember at the end of the millennium Satan's gonna gather all the nations and come against the camp of God and God's gonna burn up all those nations now I can't explain that I don't know how that's gonna happen it's gotta go that some people go through the Armageddon and make it in the Millennium I don't know is he gonna allow you know allow people to make you spoken word created I don't know how that's gonna happen but somehow there's gonna be people that make it into the millennium and then they got to get destroyed at the Battle of Gog and Magog that's that's pretty deep and I can't explain all that but I just want you to see that so let's go back to zico 48 now so I want you to see that this subscripts your brother Branham gives us are the Millennium let's read X I'm sure we haven't read that lately I know I haven't read that like the unless I read it when we preach on the Millenium last year Ezekiel 48 and this is all in the church age book as you're probably aware of now I'm just gonna read one two and five all right because well uh three five and six one two five and six because you'll see Dan and Ephraim's name are back in the tribes all right now verse one now these are the names of the tribes from the north end to the coast of the way of Heflin as one goeth Tehama 'the hayes Arion the border of damascus northward to the coast of hema 'the four these are the sides east and west a portion for Dan there's Dan and by the border of Dan from the East Side west side a portion of for Asher I go down to verse five and by the border Manasseh from the east side and the west side a portion for Ephraim and by the border of Ephraim from the east side unto the west side a portion for Reuben we'll stop right there so somehow they get back in their names in the book of life I can't explain that but if God's Word says that brother Ram keeps repeating this over and over again if God says something about the book of life in the Bible we just have to accept it we don't want to argue with God's book we just want to agree with God's book hey we have not if we understand we have a right to sometimes question brother Branham because he was a man do you understand what I'm saying well because he might make a mistake right we ever sometimes because every man must every word a man says must be taken back to the Word of God right prove all things but we don't have a right to question God you never understand that because every word God said is thus saith the Lord and we would never cross question brother Ram Michael I wonder if he's a prophet we're beyond that we know we know his teaching was the say at the Bible we know that I'm just saying like understanding minor doctrines there it can does that make sense everybody we have to take everything brother Ram said back to the word okay if not we're gonna get confused on a few doctrines because he was a man he grew an understanding all right so I hope that's okay now I've had a busy week so I don't get a chance to put all the scriptures and quotes up here so I just wrote down the page numbers I'll read them out of the church age book and we'll go from there by the grace of God now that's my prayer in church and hope for the church that as we go through the church ages and any series we do that you and I get so settled and groundedness that nobody can deceive us right nobody can trick us nobody can bring a lie or a false doctor in the church and if a false doctrines brought in the church the Holy Spirit will discern that and we'll talk to the brother afterwards or you'll talk to me afterwards if that will be so found in the Word of God that no man may deceive us this Jesus said I like that that's what we need to be sound like that by the grace of the Lord okay so let me get out my book here let's go to chapter I'm sorry go to page 272 in the church age book I want to read this page here or this paragraph it starts with another illustration okay so if you have your Bibles brother Ram quotes first Corinthians 10 so you got your Bibles it's gonna first corinthians chapter 10 and we'll read verses 1 to 4 first corinthians 10 1 to 4 first Corinthians 10 one through four okay now the purpose of this paragraph as the first word say brother Adam gives us another illustration of idolatry I'm sorry our names being removed he gives us another illustration of names being removed and a lot of these are more illustrations further showing more Bible examples all right so let's read verses 1 to 4 moreover brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all baptized through the sea and we're all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and it all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ their Christ is in the Old Testament he's the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah verse 5 but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now it's 1 stop right there this is why we it's so important that we preach both sides we have to preach the truth but then we have to preach warning as well because anybody can be baptized look look at this 2 million people were baptized but we want to rejoice when the little kids get baptized you know we want to rejoice when the adults get baptized we want to do that because we're just hoping that they're their true kind of believer but time will tell as with everything God makes everything beautiful his own time amen time is gonna tell can we stand the test of time praise God and that's what we see here that's it brother Anderson here's another illustration of idolatry now go to verse 6 now these things were I'm sorry now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand so so far what does he warned us of idolatry right and fornication the next one number nine neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted Christ and were destroyed of serpents 9 verse 10 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer I wish you those are we gonna battle the most I don't know I would I might say murmuring what would you say idolatry I would think idolatry murmuring might be the most that would affect I'm talking about us Salah believers that love the Lord I'm this I'm talking about those who come to church all the time those who pray read their Bible and praying and seeking God with all their hearts that's what I'm talking about murmuring complaining when things don't go our way or or we don't see the answer to our prayers or times get hard I think idolatry oh is is hard is a hard battle at many times because of the cares of the world can anybody say amen to that you know the cares of the world come in the pressures of life and if we're not careful things become more important than God things we get more excited about the new gadget then reading our Bibles I was praying that this morning you know because last few weeks new phones have come out the new Apple phone and the new Google phone came out today and I like technology but I was praying that lord help you know look I was looking at my life am i more excited about reading my Bible or new phones and they come out that's a good indicator do we get more excited about the new receipe you know for our sisters or the the new washing machine I might come out you know how to know what sister was like but that's a reality we've got to make sure we don't let anything come more precious than Jesus amen you see those are the ones I feel like we need to check our lives for we don't let idolatry come in a fornication usually shows up right away and and there are certain situations I know you know where I've got to be careful we're not supposed to eat with fornicators so I was on guard Sunday if we had certain visitor and certain people come I was on guard to tell people I was told my wife on the way there I said I might tell people they can't eat with us today because we're not allowed to eat with fornicators the Bible said Bible says that doughnut you with fornicators because you're supposed to show a difference between holy and unholy that's what you're supposed to do so I was ready if we had certain visitors I know there's certain things as a pastor I know about I was gonna tell people I'm sorry I'll give you some food I'll give you a plate but you can't eat with us because it's the Bible says you do that to shame them to bring them back to repentance all right there's ever we do we know that's in the scripture do one read death okay do we know okay okay but notes inscription all right that has to be done the number Paul said in first Corinthians five and six get that person out of the church if they don't repent of that get them out of the church because that's a cancer in the church that's a lust demon that's gonna try to it's on this brother or it's on this sister and it's gonna try to jump on somebody else that's exactly right so that's what I'm saying you know the Bible says here where the RAM gives us these examples these are illustrations to help us not to have idols in our lives not to murmur not to complain right and not to tempt the Lord now verse 11 now all these things happen to them foreign samples and they're written for our admonition ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall so can everybody see why it's so important at all times we should always have the attitude of oh I just want to be right with the Lord I've got to watch my life we can never walk into here and take a Wednesday night service for granted because that's when people fall when they feel like they've arrived when they're patting themselves on the back look what I've done and look you know look how great of a message believer I am like that's why we got to have constant humility to recognize we're nothing if we take this for granted we're gonna fall so see that's why we've got and we got to make these services new we've got to refresh our minds renew our hearts and minds right get our first love back constantly amen we have to do that or else we're gonna fall into sin and temptation verse 13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man now let me stop right there that's where a lot of people get into self-pity right they say I preach on that often you know people said well nobody has it as hard as I do well this brother has it so easy this sister has it so easy well yeah in our local church you know you might be the only person that experiences certain things but what about other churches what about churches around the world we have to remember we're not the only message believers right there's people all around the world battling the same thing and if other people are getting the victory through the power of the Holy Spirit we can get that as well amen and we got to take courage we got to say God if I can't look beyond my local church lord send me a testimony from somebody help me to find a testimony on youtube or help me to find a testimony through my mom or somebody like my dad or somebody that will encourage me to keep on the fire lines because the Bible said we've all been tempted in the same ways right there's different temptations we battle help me to take courage in my temptation and help me to be an overcomer the Bible said but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry see how he puts idolatry and then he ends with idolatry we've got to run away from anything that starts taking our love away from God so anything that takes away from your prayer life anything takes away your time from your daily devotions for the moms in the morning with the the children or or the dads at night you know anything that's taking those away we've got to run from those things amen run from the movies right or run run from the tablet timer whatever whatever's taking time away from God run from that and run to Christ that's the only way we're gonna get victory in this hour now that's the scripture brother I'm quoted here he said this is another illustration is the story of Israel leaving Egypt for Canaan he says but when they came to Moab those who join in the feast of el peor all died their carcasses fell in the wilderness for it was they're that they refuse the Word of God and turned from it okay so that's that's the illustration all of Egypt filed the cloud followed followed the pillar fire right they all came out following Moses the pillar of fire a lot of people put up brother branham's picture with the pillar of fire a lot of people start out with that picture a lot of people get baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ a lot of people get healed a lot of them drink from the spiritual rock the spiritual blessings right but then they fall away and that's what Israel did at bale peor they married into fornication or their or they they had fornications or unlawful relations with people that were not Israelites they entered into false relationships or evil relationships and the Prophet said that's what I mean we must not do now the next trip's forgives as Hebrews 6 let's go there Hebrews 6:1 where we just start with one but let's go back to Hebrews 6 then that's right we read verses 1 and 2 and 3 I believe Hebrews 6 started 3 probably there we go Hebrews 6 now we read verse 3 that start verse 4 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and a taste of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame all right that's the warning the Prophet gives as Israel came out they had all these supernatural things as they came out they fell away by joining themselves with bail peor which was idolatry right and so the proper the Bible gives us that same idea if we partake of spiritual things but don't continue on the Word of God then we'll become idolaters as well we got to continue into every promise of God and we know the promise of God today the promise of God today is the fullness of Pentecost we'll be in the bride amen that's our promise for today rapturing faith is our promise today amen that's our promise we've heard a shout we're listening the shout we're looking for a voice of an archangel amen which program said Christ does all three as he descends so Christ somehow will give the word to Archangel and we'll hear the voice that we're growing into that that's the word were we're desiring to fulfill in this hour a bride who makes herself ready we're constantly getting ready for the coming of the Lord we're looking for Christ's coming amen but see we can't shy away from that we can't draw back if we draw back we become my doubters we must go in all the word for our day now the Prophet says this next he says you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the word amen there are people and listen this statement there people who seem involved in the things of God almost 100% he says they are like Judas that's quite a statement Judas was almost a hundred percent I don't want to be 99 Church I want to be a hundred percent I want my whole life to be involved with the things of God Judas was maybe 99 I don't know you could go higher I lower I don't know but he wasn't a hundred we know that he wasn't a hundred percent involved in things of God because he was stealing on the side you got a little thief business on the side that's right well all of our business to be godly all of our preparation look at us and say that if the I ever met a Christian that's the Christian they they told me they're gonna pay me they paid me they owed the old interest they paid their interest you know that's a real Christian amen somebody who's faithful in all areas he said that's what Judas was he wasn't in the word all the way but RAM said Judas did exact there came a day when Judas did exactly what Israel did at bale peor he decided he wanted to join the false vine forces enter into the financial political organization of anti word antichrist religion and he did so was fooled and he catch that word he was fooled the other eleven were not they could not be four they were the very elect so when Judas left and betrayed the Lord his name was removed from the book of life to catch that word he was fooled now that's interesting word because we know people are gonna be saved and they're still called foolish virgin right so see the foolish virgin is only foolish to the Holy Ghost they got justification down they've got sanctification down but they're foolish to being born again they don't let the Holy Ghost flow through them in power to be clothed or and do with power from on high they just which is good they got st. vacation and justification but they don't have the power of the Holy Ghost to live the life all the time amen but now Judas is so foolish he leaves that the true message of the hour and joins with them politically and religiously somebody see that so see we don't want to be involved 99% we want to backup everything God's doing a hundred percent in church what did he do he pulled away from the message of the hour and that's why when we see people pull away from church or pull away from the message and go out denominational churches that you see why that burdens me you see why that should burden you to not to get discouraged you know or be critical of others we don't want to do that but it should burden us because they're doing the same thing that Judas did and they don't even know what they're doing like they leave the standards of holiness they'll start drinking publicly and all these things like that like I follow though I follow these groups that left a message I'm not gonna say their names because I don't want to criticize them like that I mean I sometimes I do but I'm gonna say something real real personal here I listen to some of their broadcasts to see what they're doing and they're talking about which wine is their favorite wine and now that and see now they left the message now they feel like I'm free to drink wine out in public and do all these things and you see how that's a stumbling block Paul said if I drink wine and make somebody stumble he said I cause he said because of my liberty he said a brother parish in Christ posted that so he said I won't drink wine or eating meat sacrificed to idols as long as the world standeth he said so I don't cause anybody to stumble you see how that can be a real they leave a message and though now I can drink publicly now I can do these things and and that can cause people to stumble they let their women wear tight pants and and got holes in it you know I've seen pictures of my friends or some of my friends that left on the message on Facebook they're sisters now where and you know and they have holes right here in their genes you've seen it right they buy jeans and there's holes in them have you seen those I see teenagers you know all the time they have holes right here and so these women that usually go to message churches now they got skin tight pants on and they're hugging their pastor dads or you know the preacher dads that used to preaching the message with high heels on and they're all smiles and like this is the right thing to do they're fooled are you with my church they're fooled they're revealing parts of the body that the Bible says our nakedness and they're drinking and doing things they shouldn't do what happened they got fooled now they're not even living their food into not even living a sanctified life and you see if they don't catch that and get corrected by the Holy Spirit it's possible if they're not careful they could have their names removed from the book of life right so see that's why whenever people draw back from God or they're less dedicated to God that's why it's such a burden to me because I don't want to be involved 99 percent or 75 percent or 50 percent I want to be a hundred percent I don't want there to be any doubts how much I'm dedicated I want to be a hundred percent does that help by God's grace and I you know I'm see I'm not trying to be critical I'm just saying this is the pattern we see foolish virgins don't go in although in the word all the way but the wise virgin do go all the way all the word that's being preached to them they say Amen now here's one thing I want to say to my brother Samuel told me this was a real lot of wisdom he said we know the prophecy for this day we were talking about the fullness of Pentecost being the bride and we're talking about the bride makes herself ready and he made a really good point and really helped me he said well Jessie we know the Word of God most of a fill he said we just got to be patient to see how God lets it come to pass in our lives I thought that's really wonderful boy did I need to hear that because he pardon me I want to see it happen right now right like don't you I mean wouldn't it be nice to see all the gifts in operation and people like everybody winning souls you know people staying here to pray before service and then staying after and people being baptized I mean we like to see like a revival right way I mean we like to see that but God doesn't always do that way you know and God has to allow us to go through trials and hard times and times that test our faith the Bible said our faith has to go through a furnace a fire and then our faith is comes out at the end in the right kind of faith like I told you when I first came in our church we had seven people and I thought God was just and then bounzer came in and then pretty soon more people come in and Adam I'm sorry uh Anthony Scruggs and all these different people start coming in Devon and yeah I'm thinking boy this is gonna be a revival forever that's wonderful you know but you see how it is God lets time go on God goes through seasons we know the word has got to be fulfilled we just got to hang on with patience and know that God won't give us a trial that we can't handle and I've seen that to be true as long as we hang on to God's Word God hangs on us but see that's why with this this issue here he gives us illustration people can be baptized they can believe the pillar of fire you know they can they can have healing waters flow out of the rock of Christ they can actually be healed all these things but then fall away if they don't go on with the word all right am i doing on time okay I got 20 more minutes bear with me here I know it's reviewed by church member it's settling us it's grounding us and the things of God praise the Lord all right I'm sorry next so broadband tells us that's when Judas's name was taken off the book of life when he was fooled and he left the the things of God and then he went out to join the political forces that's when his name was taken off so we even know exactly when his name left I'm sorry was removed rather when he left on that night of the communion all right now the next paragraph on 272 now I'm sure you've noticed that those whose names were in the book of life were a part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God and the worship of him though they did not worship according to the truth or word like Judas they didn't go all the way see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared of the knowledge of the mysteries he had a ministry of power granted unto Him and He healed the sick and cast out devils in Jesus name when the showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the Spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit now go to Jude 1 verse 19 go to Jude 1 verse 19 Jude 1:19 so this paragraph the prophets making us aware he's pointing out again those whose names are removed from the book of life were actually gathered around the message of the hour it wasn't a false religion you just wasn't gather around Buddhism or Confucianism as Confucianism he wasn't involved around that a psychological idea he was gather around Christ the word and that's whose people's names are removed those that around the true word and leave the true word that's why these things are striking for us on a Wednesday night or any time because we are gathered around the true word and we got to make sure we stay with the true word all right I'm sorry Jude 1:19 now hide you and read out for me do you want 19 [Music] all right what they do they separate themselves see being able to stay with God's Word and God's people is a good sign you are saved because Judas did it Judas left he sold out and memmer the seven he had already left it the big move had already left right and they're just down to their small group of preachers 70 preachers have left now they're down to 12 right that's right you know that's as ministers I hear when we talk with brother Brooks and different brothers you know and we just think well where are we in the message you know I've we got the spot where the big group of preachers is left and they're still Judas laughs you know how people like they like to think of because the scripture is prophetic these are types that repeat so we wonder about that have the majority of preachers left that are gonna leave or there's still more to come to come I don't know remember Judas hung around the longest he hung around to the very last moment and they didn't go up to get the Holy Ghost and he's not foolish virgin he was foolishly foolishly lost he was a foolish make believer right not even a foolish virgin because he wasn't true to all the word he loved the steel he never got a victory over stealing so see those who separate themselves from the true Church of God prove they don't have the Holy Spirit because they don't want to hang around the true Word of God they don't want to go deeper than things of God look at verse 20 but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying and the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life so see this proves Judas was not praying in the Holy Spirit he was probably just saying as regular Hail Mary prayer you know something he was just saying repetitious prayers because those who are in the true church pray and build up their faith with the Holy Ghost prayer they start praying and they know it's not themselves now God's praying through me now I'm praying with the spirits anointing on me and they keep themselves in the love of God which the love of God is keeping all God's commands it's just that simple this is the love of God to keep all my commands okay so that's the example the Prophet gives there with Judas Judas left he separated himself from the people of God all right now he says make no mistake about it a person that's truly baptized with the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the Spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fell right there and when they failed to go on in that word their names are taken off the book of life it's a serious thing to say I believe the message because if you don't go on in it with it it proves your name's gonna be removed right think about all the people we've known that have fallen away and no longer care about God and all these things we once we hear we've got to keep going we've got to possess the land amen we've got to take our position in Christ God wants people that will take their position and stand there as adopted sons and daughters amen we're there their name on the check is just as good as their father's amen they know what God wants done with the word amen hallelujah now I want to read that one too it's go to a first John and I want to read that one they went out from us because they were not of us but let me find it real quick if anybody finds it oh yeah they're just first John chapter 2 verse 18 remember this is what the prophet of God is showing here you have to go with the word all the way those who don't of the Holy Spirit they separate themselves from the true believers just like Judas verse 18 - 18 little children it is the last time and as she ever heard that Antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time that was 2,000 years ago what about today much there's many more Antichrist there's many more tears today they went out from us but they were not of us see they were not wheat seed they were tears the whole time for if they had been of us they no doubt would have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us so see the separation with Judas it had to come because it was going to manifest which side he was on and see these trials in our lives they happened so we can manifest which side were on amen and for us it's a good thing right for us it's a good thing because it shows that we are manifesting we're the true bride we want to go deeper in the word we want all the word but for other people follow the way it shows they're not the true bride because they separate themselves from the Word of God they can't handle the word they won't want to feed on the word they'd rather have cares of the world all these things but we want all the word amen all right okay here's a second example in order to further clarify so if you got your Bibles let's go to Exodus 32 30 please Exodus 32 30 X is 30 to 30 so this is a second example of idolatry and names being removed from the book of life we saw Judas and now here's another one oh yeah we saw this was actually a third example right because we already saw Dan and Ephraim so here's a third example we saw Dan and Ephraim Old Testament they went to New Testament Judas now we go back to the Old Testament a third example Exodus 32 33 34 and it came to pass on the morrow that Moses and the people you have sinned a great sin and now I will go up unto the Lord peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin and Moses returned to the Lord and said oh this people has sinned a great sin and has made them gods of gold yet now if thou won't forgive their sin and if not blot me I pray thee out of that book which thou hast written and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever has sinned against me him will I blot out of my book therefore now go lead the people into the place of which I have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in that day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them alright can you say amen to that you like that now look at Moses his heart it was in his heart that his name would be removed because he didn't want to see the people miss it can you imagine that I guess what Paul had the same desire remember Paul said I wish I myself could be curse and Israel could be saved that was in Romans 11 Paul said that and most of the same thing God I saved this person but let me be lost can you imagine that there's a part of me I don't want to be lost let's see when you get so full of love there's no there's so much that you want to say god I'd do anything to see this person saved that's how I feel like with my dad I talked to on the phone and you know different things were said and I just thought I'd do anything to see this man saved is there anything I can do to see this man saved I'd give anything to see him saved and so this is the heart of Moses blot me take my name out that they can be say but God said no you keep living the life you keep leading the people of God don't leave your position Church stay right in your position amen I like that level he tells Moses there do not leave your position hallelujah now he says this the Prophet said it's more than evident that the names have been and will be removed from the book of life air time should be no more in this particular places because of idolatry even as when Dan the Ephraim lost their rights as tribes were worshiping the golden calves all who worship the idols had their names removed from the book of life let's close with one more go to Psalm 69 please and I might need some help maybe brother Adam and Malachi maybe reading some here Psalm 69 21 so I'm 69 21 69 21 now the profit gives one more example he says when Israel rejected Jesus Christ as Messiah God blotted the majority of their names out I took this you know why this is striking because Jesus prayed Father forgive them for they know not what they do Jesus even prayed for some of them to be saved but the Bible says most of them had their names blotted out so what happened God only saved the predestinated see that's how we are we don't know whose predestinated we say God have mercy on those who are crucifying the word and saying our doctrines offer you know we don't preach the truth when all we do is preach the Bible that's all we do is preach the Bible oh you know Jesse's a Holy Roller he preaches this or he's in a call I've heard people tell me that I'm just well I'm in a cult that believes the Bible and that's all I could say I'm just a Bible believing cup it's not a cult like you'd say you know but there's just a group of believers that love the Lord Jesus Christ and that's what I'm guilty of that's what I'm guilty of but I'm just guilty of believing all the Word of God but here the Prophet is one more examples here's a fourth example Dan and Ephraim Judas are the last one we just read which was who is that again oh the days of Moses the people Moses let out who worship the golden calf their names are removed and then now those who rejected Christ its verses 21 to 28 so maybe we start with you by that I might be okay 21 you read 21 22 and 23 that be okay [Music] hey man thank you sir now remember this is right after remember this was when Jesus on the cross right he said I thirst and they give him that gall to drink right in the vinegar and this is what God said is going to happen to the Israelites who rejected Christ did it happen absolutely remember they said let his blood be upon us and our children and the Jew has been persecuted ever since are you with me Church you understand that this is what the Bible said and yet jesus prayed Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing the elect would be forgiven amen the elect would be forgiven those who God foreknew that's right now look at verse 25 I'm sorry 26 now can you read 26 and 27 28 please those three all right look at that let them be blotted out of the book of the living can you can you see that the majority of people in Jesus day even though he prayed for them the majority had their names blotted out because they rejected the Messiah that rejected the word of the hour all right and the Prophet gives one more example of y'all a scripture closer here's one more example of God doing this and it's in acts 1346 let's go there acts 1346 X 1346 is this beautiful my I just I love these things like I said I love teaching he said I love to go scripture by scripture Acts 1346 because now you can see why people's names get removed thirteen I think it's 46 to 48 yeah that's right 46 to 48 yeah and that's why it's so important for us on a Wednesday night because we want to make sure our name is on the Lamb's Book of Life right God knows ultimately but we have to make our calling and election sure we have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling and the way to do that is to be in the word all the way don't draw back and relax on your walk with God press forward and give everything you got whatever's in the way sacrifice it let it fall to the wayside and put Christ first amen we have to do that if not we're gonna be idolaters there's so much to idolize in this world but we don't want to idolize anything we just want to love Christ there's so many temptations but there's also so much power for the believer yeah amen all right verse 46 out 40 I'll read these now actually if you know if you remember this they're the Paul martyrs preached to Sabbath days in a row so two Saturdays in a row they preached and then verse 45 the Jews saw it and they were filled with envy they're jealous of the big crowds and they spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and they fiend other words that's to speak evil of so they called the Jesus preaching the the preaching of Jesus and Messiah they called that we'd say tommyrot or nonsense or trash whatever they said they blaspheme the Holy Ghost look at verse 46 then Palm Armas wax bold and said it was necessary that the Word of God should have first been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourself unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the Gentiles so he said they've already judged themselves they've already showed they're not going to be saved so we've got to leave them and we got to go to the Gentiles they've already blast seemed right they've already left it they turn from the truth they don't want to hear they were already going to separate themselves so let him go we'll go to the Gentiles for the lord hath commanded us saying I've set to be a light for a Gentiles that thou should it be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of Lord and as many words were ordained to eternal life believed amen let's stay on our feet by God's grace praise the Lord hey that's why you know I was thinking I was coming here tonight which believer doesn't wanna examine their life and make sure they're obeying God's Word and which believer doesn't want to make sure they take heed lest they fall every believer wants to do that because the Bible says I'm shooting that you should never pull back from the things of God we should just invest more on the things of God alright well that's how I strengthened us here tonight to take heed that you don't fall let's just pray Heavenly Father grateful again tonight lord I trusts more of the people receive something from you sure that's what we saw for examples when you remove and your Bible said these are written for our admonition this was greater than that we can benefit from this helpless Lord God not to have any items in our life I'm just going to pray from the church and the pray for myself or is it I didn't said that prayer this morning I don't want to phone to become a tiger we don't want family to become idols where we put family above the Word of God we don't want cars we don't anything Lord God become my idol in our lives we want a hunger and thirst after you we want you to have preeminence Lord everything so father we're bringing over this you said to take heed lest he fall remember that our temptations are common to all men I'm a pastor I go through temptations I understand pastors all around the world go through these same temptations be safe trials held leader remember that God is faithful he won't give me something I get in here I miss all Lord in our walks of life in our positions where you places help us off to remember these things do help us to receive these things and if your prophet said to be more settled have a foundation Lord to be more secured Christ that's what it's doing for us a little god that's what it's doing for me Lord we're not pulling away as foolish first one we're not pulling away from the things of God we're in the things of God all the way whatever you're doing in this local assembly whatever you're doing Lord and I in our our lives we want it to get to you we want to be obedient it because the sacrifice mode you can call us to this ministry because to that Lord God we want to say yes Lord here am I send me Lord God usually I want to be in the word all the way I never want to say no Holy Spirit like go any further I can't give any more well let us say yes Holy Spirit I'll take your word and I manifest you were I'll pray to the Holy Ghost I'll build up my faith Lord amen if I'm weak I'll say God help me to pray give me strength as I pray I'll keep myself in the love of God loving the things of God loving the obedience of the word I will not murmur about my life I want to her about my temptations and trials the suffering is I go through my family I will not touch Christ I will not fornicate spiritual ear country I will not let allow any items in my life but I would take heed your word is a lamp as we sing this song Lord we're gonna wait upon you and renew our strength believe you would read that scripture on Sunday morning you told us one thing to do when we feel weak that's the way to party waiting for strength Wow and disobey don't get don't get any patient and try to act upon the word like Saul tried to do it himself help us to be patient and know that strength will come other drinking comes or any dollar it's just a drought too long did we attach the money more to somebody else working I know numerous people that told me when I get discouraged of Jesse I think of you and I appreciate such a small opportunity and I think if you can do it I can do it [Music] because I love nothing of other people have smaller churches that we have and it's not about the number as you Akaka Tallis it's about the quality of the homes the quantity of people the quantity of emotion or something like that or even gifts where's the quality of the word and the holy spirit so all the lives that we live help us to take hers norm so glad my needs will wait upon you Oh God we know you [Music] [Applause]
