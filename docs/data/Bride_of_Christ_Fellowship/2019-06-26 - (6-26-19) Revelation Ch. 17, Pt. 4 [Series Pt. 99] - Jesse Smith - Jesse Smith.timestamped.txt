[32:16] Amen let's take our Bibles here tonight
[32:18] let's go to Revelation 17 like to do
[32:20] part 4 on revelation 17 and 18
[32:33] revelation 17 I like to start at verse 8
[32:40] Lord willing tonight revelation 17 verse
[32:42] 8 revelation 17 verse 8
[32:58] last time we we kind of had our text in
[33:01] verse 7 where John had great admiration
[33:04] about this beautiful woman and we saw
[33:08] what a beautiful place the Vatican is
[33:10] naturally but spiritually if you could
[33:14] look at it you would see a cage of
[33:16] unclean and hateful bird 'he's my
[33:19] revelation 17 verse 8
[33:29] I like to finish chapter 7
[33:34] tonight and begin 18 and if we have time
[33:38] I like to look at the the Bible says you
[33:42] can take I'm sorry Oh buying and selling
[33:45] will only be accomplished through one of
[33:46] three ways I like to get to that the
[33:50] mark the name or the number of his name
[33:52] I'd like to get to that Lord willing if
[33:54] I could tonight so we'll see what the
[33:56] Holy Spirit has for us here so
[33:58] revelation 17 verse 8 if you're there
[34:00] say Amen
[34:02] I'll read 17 I'll read 17 8 I'll just
[34:09] read that one without just be our text
[34:10] here tonight verse 8 the Beast that thou
[34:12] sawest was and is not and shall ascend
[34:15] out of the bottomless pit and go into
[34:17] perdition and they that dwell on the
[34:20] earth shall wonder whose names were not
[34:23] written in the book of life from the
[34:25] foundation of the world when they behold
[34:28] the Beast that was and is not and yet is
[34:33] amen may God as busing redeem his word
[34:35] he may be seated there praise God
[34:44] so we like to look look at verse eight
[34:46] we'll start there
[34:47] we'll start picking up here and Lord
[34:51] willing we'll get to these thoughts
[34:53] tonight I'd like to get to now verse
[34:57] eight speaks of a beast that comes out
[35:00] of the bottomless pit now if you know
[35:04] your Bible real well especially
[35:06] revelation the Beast can stand for a few
[35:08] things it can stand for the Antichrist
[35:11] the person of the Pope the future Pope
[35:15] rather it can also stand brother Hampson
[35:18] the beast is Rome so the evil spirit of
[35:20] Rome or the Antichrist spirit and so we
[35:24] see in verse eight after John admires
[35:26] this woman and look at a great
[35:28] admiration we see that a beast he sees a
[35:33] beast that was and is not and shall
[35:36] ascend out of the bottomless pit and go
[35:38] into perdition and they that dwell on
[35:41] the earth shall wonder whose names were
[35:43] not written in the book of life from the
[35:46] foundation of the world when they behold
[35:48] the Beast that was and is not and yet is
[35:52] so this scripture makes it seem like
[35:54] that beast is there in perdition or on
[35:57] the bottomless pit and will come up so
[36:00] of course this could have a few meetings
[36:02] I'm not going to nail this down to one
[36:03] particular but we know Satan during the
[36:07] thousand year millennial reign he gets
[36:09] thrown down to the bottomless pit so
[36:11] this could represent Satan or it could
[36:14] represent the spirit of Satan that will
[36:17] anoint the Antichrist later well one
[36:20] thing's for sure when it comes to the
[36:22] beast or the spirit of Rome all the
[36:24] earth is going to wonder after this
[36:25] beast and kind of admire this beast
[36:28] unless their names were written in the
[36:32] Lamb's Book of Life amen
[36:34] what a blessing Church to know tonight
[36:36] Alleluia it gives you a great
[36:39] encouragement and a great proof that
[36:41] your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life
[36:44] if you can recognize the beast the
[36:47] Spirit of Rome and if you can see it
[36:48] working you know through ancient Rome
[36:50] and now it's in papal Rome and now it's
[36:53] in the United States government and
[36:55] religion if you can see that
[36:57] and you don't wonder after and you don't
[36:59] admire and you don't think it's a good
[37:01] thing that's good proof that your name
[37:03] was written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[37:05] a my head because we see the same thing
[37:07] in revelation 13 if you got your Bible
[37:10] revelation 13:8 collec Hebrews 13:8
[37:13] revelation 13:8 and all that dwell upon
[37:16] the earth shall worship Him whose names
[37:18] are not written in the book of the life
[37:21] of the lamb slain from the foundation of
[37:25] the world praise God
[37:26] so God has a book with names on it that
[37:29] was in heaven before earth was founded
[37:32] praise God amen and Jesus Christ was
[37:36] slain God's plan in his mind before the
[37:40] earth was already founded amen
[37:42] hallelujah which is striking it's just
[37:44] it goes back to these great deep
[37:46] thoughts God is giving us insight into
[37:49] his foreknowledge praise God because
[37:51] mother Adam tells us that's the order of
[37:54] how God did things he started with
[37:56] foreknowledge and then he called and
[37:58] then he predestinated Amen hallelujah
[38:01] so God first had to have foreknowledge
[38:03] what kind of seed we'd be would we be a
[38:06] believer or unbeliever and because of
[38:09] that God can't force you to go to heaven
[38:10] a house of God has to give you the free
[38:12] choice and God foresaw and because he
[38:15] foresaw he could write that book praise
[38:17] God amen and put your name your your
[38:21] name my name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[38:23] they met he said because God knew we'd
[38:26] love him amen hallelujah and then he
[38:29] could call us and then he could
[38:32] predestinate us amen but bro Graham said
[38:35] he didn't say well I just choose you and
[38:36] I don't I don't like you so I won't
[38:38] choose you I like them he said he
[38:40] couldn't do that and be just but he had
[38:42] to have for now Jannah for know what you
[38:45] would choose
[38:46] I always think on that because sometimes
[38:47] people you know I make us sound like we
[38:50] have no choice at all but you can't have
[38:53] that because then there's no free more
[38:54] agency brother man said whenever God
[38:56] plays Adam and Eve on God had to do the
[38:59] same thing for everybody
[39:00] amen and Adam and Eve were on free more
[39:03] agency right and because they're the
[39:05] free choice if you do this you do that
[39:07] if you do this this will happen and
[39:09] because they had free more
[39:11] see you have to remain on free more
[39:13] agency and thank God with free Boise we
[39:16] choose to love Jesus Christ tonight amen
[39:18] hey Laurie no one's forcing me to do it
[39:22] no one's pressuring me to do it but I
[39:24] feel I feel burden to it yes but it's
[39:26] the burden of the Holy Spirit amen
[39:28] it's not a burden of a denomination or a
[39:30] man it's a burden from God Almighty amen
[39:33] sorry a little in my pocket there now
[39:36] what a now look at that just from over
[39:40] the Beast that was is not so at this
[39:43] point when John wrote it this beast
[39:45] wasn't because it's in the bottomless
[39:47] pit and yet is so it still exists it was
[39:52] on the earth it's not right now but it
[39:54] still exists so it looks like this
[39:57] spirit of Satan here to anoint either
[40:00] the full spirit of Rome or the Pope I
[40:04] got just that is my thought now verse 9
[40:06] and here is the mind which hath wisdom
[40:08] the seven heads of the seven mountains
[40:10] on which the woman sitteth
[40:12] that was one of the eleven proofs that
[40:14] Mystery Babylon is the Roman Catholic
[40:15] Church because ancient Rome sat on seven
[40:18] hills and you can just zoom in to Apple
[40:20] maps or Google Maps and you can see
[40:21] those seven hills and any time you want
[40:24] to do that verse 10 now and there are
[40:27] seven kings five or fall and one is and
[40:30] the other is not yet come and when he
[40:32] cometh he must continue a short space
[40:33] now I don't understand verse 10 so I'm
[40:36] not going to try to interpret it verse
[40:39] 11 and the Beast that was and is not
[40:42] even he is the eighth and is of the
[40:44] seven and goeth into perdition now that
[40:46] makes it sounds like going in perdition
[40:48] is the same a thing they said in verse
[40:50] eight so that makes it look like it's an
[40:52] eighth Pope but again I don't know I'm
[40:54] not for sure because they both go into
[40:56] perdition the Beast and verse 8 goes
[40:58] into perdition and now this beast in
[41:01] verse 11 goes into perdition and it's
[41:03] the last one verse 12 and the ten horns
[41:06] which thou sawest are ten Kings which
[41:09] have not received no Kingdom as yet so
[41:11] when John sees us the horns represent
[41:14] Kings that that don't even manifest for
[41:17] when he saw it took two thousand years
[41:19] later so the Beast has ten horns but
[41:22] they don't even manifest until the
[41:24] Tribulation
[41:25] period he they have no Kingdom yet but
[41:28] receive power as kings one hour with the
[41:32] Beast
[41:32] nine the band said those are those are
[41:37] tyrants first 13 these have one mind and
[41:42] shall give their power and strength unto
[41:43] the Beast these shall make war with the
[41:48] lamb and the lamb shall overcome them
[41:49] for he is Lord of lords and King of
[41:51] Kings and they that are with him are
[41:53] called and chosen and faithful amen
[41:56] look at that it already jumps ahead to
[41:57] the Battle of Armageddon how do I know
[41:59] yeah
[41:59] so in chapter 17 we jump before we jump
[42:03] way back before even the church earth
[42:06] begin the church ages then we jump back
[42:08] to about a hundred 96 ad and then we hop
[42:11] forward 2,000 years to the Battle of
[42:14] Armageddon and notice it's still causing
[42:16] the Lamb God so wants us to always
[42:20] appreciate the Lamb of God in other
[42:22] words God never wants us to forget the
[42:24] sacrifice of Jesus Christ is let's
[42:27] remember how do we get lost how do we
[42:30] get here the lamb amen
[42:32] it'll never be why look who I am I'm the
[42:34] bride I'm some big somebody no the bible
[42:37] keeps reminding us it's the lamb it's
[42:39] the lamb you're following the lamb amen
[42:41] god save you by Passover lamb amen so
[42:45] see he constantly reminding us the land
[42:48] look he the Beast has got this big huge
[42:50] beast by the air this massive beast with
[42:52] a leopard and bear he's going to make
[42:54] war against a little lamb but the lamb
[42:57] is greater amen
[42:59] the Lambs eternal hallelujah this man's
[43:01] a mighty Conqueror
[43:03] he conquered through its broad Amen the
[43:07] natural mind looking at it would look at
[43:09] the Vatican and ten ten ten Kings or ten
[43:13] tyrants and you think man these guys are
[43:15] so powerful they got military weapons
[43:17] and tanks and guns and battleships and
[43:20] submarines and they're going to fight
[43:22] against al five-foot-two Messiah a 5
[43:26] foot 2 men but the Bible said this just
[43:28] ain't a normal lamp
[43:30] this is the king of kings amen this is
[43:33] the Lord of lords amen and the lamb
[43:35] shopper
[43:37] do you know what it is
[43:40] God always hides and simplicity amen oh
[43:43] my and I like that you know a verse 14 I
[43:46] like that what it was what is Jesus
[43:48] scholars church then that are with him
[43:49] are called oh the called see first your
[43:52] your first it's for knowledge then
[43:54] you're called or elected that word means
[43:56] the same if you look it up you're
[43:58] calling an election it's the same thing
[44:00] so he said the wolves that are with the
[44:02] lamb are the called the elected and the
[44:05] chosen and the faithful see we have
[44:08] something to do we have to be faithful
[44:10] and we can do it the Bible said by
[44:13] giving all diligence we can be faithful
[44:15] to God so we got to give all of our
[44:17] human effort praise God hey man now
[44:20] verse 15 and he said unto me the waters
[44:22] which thou sawest where the
[44:24] sitteth are people's and multitudes and
[44:26] nations and tongues and the ten horns
[44:28] which thou sawest upon the Beast these
[44:30] shall hate the and shall make her
[44:32] desolate and naked and shall eat her
[44:34] flesh and burn her with fire man so they
[44:39] give their power to the Beast for one
[44:41] hour but and then of course they they
[44:44] hate the mother harlot later and destroy
[44:46] her says actually chapter 18 as well
[44:49] verse 7 17 for God hath put in their
[44:52] hearts to fulfill his will and look at
[44:54] this these evil Kings can't escape the
[44:58] will of God amen
[45:00] right just like fellow bill couldn't
[45:03] escape God's will because God knew
[45:05] Pharaoh wouldn't love him so the Bible
[45:07] said in Romans 9 that I chose Pharaoh
[45:10] that I might show my power in him amen
[45:12] because God knew he just hardened his
[45:15] heart hardness our God knew he never
[45:17] repent so God said he's a vessel he's a
[45:20] vessel fit for Wrath and destruction so
[45:22] I can use him to show my power amen amen
[45:26] same thing here I love this I love this
[45:29] because even the sinners even the Beast
[45:31] worshipers can't escape the will of God
[45:34] so you and I won't escape the will of
[45:36] God will obey the will of God amen
[45:39] it's not even realizing it but they're
[45:41] fulfilling God's will by destroying the
[45:44] mother harlot amen and we're fulfilling
[45:46] God's will by overcome
[45:50] amen Larry see we both fulfill it Laurie
[45:57] see put it in their hearts how did you
[46:00] why did you have the will of God in your
[46:01] heart to come to church tonight because
[46:03] God put it there God put it there God
[46:07] puts in their heart and God put it in
[46:09] your heart to do his will
[46:11] amen and to agree and I look at it back
[46:15] to these tyrants here to agree and to
[46:18] give their Kingdom unto the Beast until
[46:20] the words of God shall be fulfilled
[46:22] oh my see everybody's gonna fulfill
[46:25] God's will right his predestinated plan
[46:27] see because he had foreknowledge you
[46:29] could plan well these to be the enemies
[46:31] these will be the righteous well god
[46:33] bless sister Naomi good to see you
[46:34] phrase the Lord we missed you Lord bless
[46:37] you
[46:37] I didn't know you're here praise the
[46:40] Lord see until the will the words of God
[46:44] shall be fulfilled so it's our choice
[46:47] which words you want to fulfill I want
[46:50] to fulfill the words that are faithful
[46:51] called holy I want to be with that bunch
[46:54] of believers amen
[46:56] that's the will of God because remember
[46:58] Matthew seven says only those who do the
[47:01] will of God many will say Lord Lord but
[47:04] shall not enter the kingdom of God but
[47:05] only those who do the will of my father
[47:08] amen we must do the will of God for our
[47:12] generation just like David verse 18 and
[47:15] the woman which thou sawest is that
[47:17] great city which reigneth over the kings
[47:18] of the earth and we've been looking at
[47:19] that the last few weeks I think
[47:21] everybody's convinced on that I think we
[47:24] saw last time how pope john paul ii he
[47:28] was credited with ending the cold war
[47:30] between Soviet Union United States he's
[47:33] given credit for that a pope because you
[47:36] can't war against the kings of the earth
[47:37] or the Kings can't war against that guy
[47:40] right because he has spiritual influence
[47:42] over them that's right mine now let me
[47:48] look at my notes here I want to hit a
[47:49] few things here okay now let's go
[47:55] you're 18 here I'll bet you want to get
[47:59] to this the buying and selling here
[48:05] verse 18 and after these things I saw
[48:08] another angel come down from heaven
[48:09] having great power and the earth was
[48:12] lightened with his glory see woman
[48:15] angels never a her glory it's always his
[48:18] glory and he cried mightily with a
[48:21] strong voice saying Babylon the Great is
[48:23] fallen is fallen has become the
[48:25] habitation of devils and the hold of
[48:28] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[48:30] unclean and hateful bird for some
[48:37] nations their right scene if you're
[48:41] paying attention for some nations all
[48:45] nations see the Roman Catholic Church
[48:48] still has to get into every nation now I
[48:52] want to say this we went to the voice of
[48:55] God last year they told us that there's
[48:57] so many more languages that the message
[48:59] needs to be translated into let me say
[49:02] this I wouldn't be surprised if the
[49:04] raptures next year but I want to be
[49:07] surprised if the raptures not even in my
[49:08] lifetime either way I wouldn't be
[49:11] surprised because not all nations have
[49:14] heard the message yet and Jesus Christ
[49:17] said in Matthew 24 he said when the
[49:21] gospel shall be preached to every nation
[49:22] then shall the end come so I wouldn't be
[49:26] surprised either way but the RAM said
[49:28] preach like it'll be in ten years but
[49:31] live like it's gonna be today amen see
[49:35] so I want to be surprised either way and
[49:38] I want to be ready either way praise God
[49:41] amen from and so what does that mean
[49:47] tours alls it means is keep all the sin
[49:49] out of your life that's all it means
[49:51] don't backside on god don't get lukewarm
[49:54] on God live on fire Holy Ghost for life
[49:57] all the time
[49:57] amen and if you're born again you will
[50:00] do that just like a dove automatically
[50:03] cleans itself out amen
[50:05] it's got oil from the inside and it
[50:08] works its way out praise God if you're
[50:10] really born again you will be if you're
[50:12] born again you're already ready for the
[50:14] rapture amen because the ticket of God
[50:16] the tokens already in you amen
[50:19] I don't know yet if you're born again
[50:21] you'll always be ready so doesn't matter
[50:23] if it happens next year or a hundred
[50:25] years from now it doesn't matter you've
[50:27] already got the oil and it's cleaning
[50:29] from the inside amen
[50:31] that's why wouldn't you know you know
[50:34] friends say people from other churches
[50:36] try to influence me like all the
[50:37] raptures you know like last year they
[50:39] said all the rapture is going to be this
[50:40] year or the year before that they said
[50:41] all they're actually gonna be 2018 you
[50:43] know after a while just it just you know
[50:46] it just rushes off your shoulder yeah
[50:47] you just get kind of get tired of people
[50:50] trying to influence you now it's
[50:51] different if somebody stands up here and
[50:53] says thus saith the Lord that's
[50:54] different now you got a reason to prove
[50:57] all things you better make sure that's
[50:58] right or you got the lying spirit but
[51:01] see people just try to Endon see they're
[51:03] trying to use scare tactics to get the
[51:04] bride ready the bride doesn't need scare
[51:07] tactics the bride needs love to get
[51:09] ready right because he will appear to
[51:13] all those that love his appearing see
[51:17] love is what motivates us to get ready
[51:19] praise God and that's what the Holy
[51:20] Ghost is charity love amen
[51:22] the love of God so see all nations
[51:26] that's why I say it could be next year
[51:28] could be fighters could be a hundred
[51:29] years for all nations have drunk of the
[51:35] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[51:36] the kings of the earth have committed
[51:38] fornication with it no matter what was
[51:39] fornication fornication was the false
[51:42] doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church
[51:44] she takes that in there and when she
[51:46] teaches her false doctrine they become
[51:48] idolaters and that spiritual fornication
[51:51] because the church is saying we're
[51:53] married to Christ we're married to
[51:54] Christ but then they're actually making
[51:56] love with the rich men and the merchants
[51:58] and the bankers is that right
[52:00] by silly by setting their statues and
[52:03] they're living their cloth linen and
[52:05] they're building their big buildings all
[52:07] these things they're actually committing
[52:09] spiritual fornication
[52:10] against Christ because Christ is the
[52:13] word amen see that's what there
[52:17] and the merchants of the earth are waxed
[52:19] rich through the abundance of her
[52:21] delicacies now I was just thinking about
[52:22] this on the way here
[52:25] there's 22 sorry 220 mm parishes
[52:29] worldwide of Catholic churches there's
[52:32] almost a quarter million and they all
[52:34] got to have gold cups and they all got
[52:36] to have spices for incense and they all
[52:39] got to have linen coats and outfits what
[52:43] so there's God so I think the Lord is
[52:45] trying to help me to find out there's a
[52:47] big economy connected with the Vatican
[52:49] it you know think about I just have to
[52:52] provide water like just let's just use
[52:54] water or chairs I as a pastor I just
[52:56] have to provide chairs and waters for
[52:58] one church now think if I had 225
[53:01] thousand of those that'd be some big
[53:04] business sir that'd be some big money
[53:06] and so we got to remember that so
[53:10] connected to the local economies these
[53:13] these Catholic parishes because the
[53:16] Vatican of course is the headquarters
[53:17] and they got to make sure all these
[53:19] parishes out there all have these
[53:22] materials to do their worship but it's
[53:25] false worship verse 4 and I heard
[53:29] another voice from heaven saying come
[53:31] out of her my people that you be not
[53:33] partakers of her sins and that you
[53:35] receive not of her plagues so one great
[53:38] angel says babylons fawn and then
[53:42] another angel says come out of her my
[53:44] people have might be brother branham
[53:46] some people probably think it is verse 5
[53:49] for the sins have reached unto heaven
[53:51] and God hath remembered her iniquities
[53:54] praise God now see that means she didn't
[53:59] confess her sins Amen because you and I
[54:02] our sins don't make it to heaven if we
[54:05] confess them because the accuser of the
[54:08] brother and Satan is there and when he
[54:10] goes to accuse us if we say God forgive
[54:13] me and really change and repent then
[54:15] there's no record of our sins in heaven
[54:17] amen
[54:19] because he's faithful and just to
[54:21] forgive us of all unrighteousness but
[54:25] see she won't repent so her sins wrong
[54:28] to heaven and reach up to heaven
[54:31] but our sins are forgiven before they
[54:33] get to heaven hey I is God that's why
[54:37] it's so important if you're born again
[54:38] you confess it right away you make a
[54:40] mistake God forgive me
[54:41] you make you teach true somebody wrong
[54:43] with an accident you quickly go back and
[54:45] say I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that
[54:46] you humble yourself but see her sins
[54:50] reach to heaven and God remembers her
[54:53] iniquity but the Bible said blessed is
[54:55] the man whom the Lord will not impute
[54:57] iniquity amen
[54:59] whose sins are forgiven whose trans
[55:01] passes are forgiven hallelujah now verse
[55:07] 6 reward her even as she rewarded you
[55:11] and double unto her double according to
[55:15] her works in the cup which she hath
[55:18] filled fill her double now isn't it
[55:22] striking sure just just a moment at
[55:24] double where's the double God says pour
[55:29] whatever evil she did double the
[55:31] punishment isn't that striking catch
[55:35] this the mother of harlots doubles gets
[55:39] double of our evil but if you remember
[55:42] Jesus rewards we get double the rewards
[55:45] the phrase God right because we we work
[55:49] with our gifts if God gives you 1 count
[55:51] what you do you double it amen God gives
[55:54] you 3 talents what do you do double it
[55:57] and get 6 God gives you 5 dance what do
[56:01] you do double it you got 10 taels he
[56:03] said I'll give you ten cities amen so
[56:06] you've got both got double God wants us
[56:08] to double God wants us to do more God
[56:11] wants us to multiply and be abundant
[56:14] amen
[56:15] hallelujah that means I'll double the
[56:18] father I'll be double the father
[56:20] I'll invest I'll become double the
[56:22] preacher I'll become double the prayer
[56:24] warrior about that amen
[56:28] I'll be double the mother that I was
[56:30] about that one whatever gift I'll be
[56:33] double of wisdom ah now we're talking
[56:37] about some spiritual accountability
[56:39] responsibility praise God
[56:41] double so we see that in both cases and
[56:44] Elijah had a double anointing of Allah
[56:48] and that types the church a man and the
[56:51] church is born the game the Holy Ghost
[56:52] so those people with the Holy Ghost will
[56:55] double their towns that God gave them oh
[56:58] that's fresh that wasn't in my notes I
[57:01] just came to me right now when I seen
[57:03] the double there they both at double we
[57:07] one double the anointing and we want to
[57:09] double the talents that God gave us
[57:11] think about a church are you a better
[57:13] Christian than you were last year I hope
[57:16] you can look back to when when you first
[57:18] really believe I hope you're double the
[57:20] Christian you are since then hey man
[57:24] because that's what Jesus said you had
[57:25] three now you got six you had five now
[57:28] you got ten double it amen so what's
[57:32] gonna take is gonna take full surrender
[57:33] it's gonna take a crucifixion he said
[57:36] take up your cross daily and follow me
[57:38] oh it's gonna be a compound interest
[57:42] it's gonna be a compound interest amen
[57:44] what does that mean every day right with
[57:46] compound interest you get interest at it
[57:48] every day it compiles and that's what
[57:51] you do choice you read your Bible every
[57:52] day don't you yeah don't you pray every
[57:55] day you pray every day read about and
[57:58] and after law starts compounding praise
[58:00] God it's not smooth to fly it starts
[58:02] about me amen and then things start
[58:04] growing and you can achieve double by
[58:07] God's grace oh thank you Lord but she
[58:12] gets double the punishment for
[58:15] mistreating God's bride God's people
[58:17] fill it to her double the angel says
[58:20] verse seven now look at this how much
[58:23] she hath glorified herself that's where
[58:27] we got to be careful we don't glorify
[58:29] brother branham or we don't glorify
[58:31] ourselves or we don't lift up our church
[58:34] see that's what watch that Catholic
[58:36] Church watch those denominations what
[58:37] they do they build these huge churches
[58:39] to glorify who themselves see so you got
[58:44] a look at the spirit behind that why did
[58:45] they build that huge church many times
[58:47] not not all the time but many times why
[58:50] did they do this huge thing because
[58:51] remember if it looks like the Catholic
[58:53] Church it might be the same spirit right
[58:56] see
[58:58] deliciously she glorified herself and
[59:02] lived deliciously so much torment and
[59:04] sorrow give her for she said in her
[59:08] heart I sit a queen and AM no Widow and
[59:11] shall see no sorrow a church that's so
[59:15] different than we are right now in our
[59:19] hearts we can say I'm the bride of Jesus
[59:21] Christ and we're truly married but
[59:25] church we whoopsy sorrow right everyone
[59:29] that lives godly in Christ Jesus shall
[59:31] suffer what persecution everyone and we
[59:34] looked at that a few months ago brother
[59:36] Graham said the hardest thing he ever
[59:37] went through his life was being rejected
[59:38] out in Arizona for three years only one
[59:41] person had him in to preach he said
[59:43] never have I had such sorrow in my life
[59:47] he said just reject it people that you
[59:51] thought were your friends rejecting you
[59:53] people mocking you make fun of you
[59:55] isolate you I don't want nothing to do
[59:58] with you and the Bible said see she
[1:00:01] wants to have no sorrows she wants an
[1:00:03] easy life but the Christian attitude is
[1:00:06] Lord I'll take up my cross daily I'll
[1:00:09] follow you whatever comes comes
[1:00:11] I know persecution is coming give me
[1:00:13] grace to go through it praise God amen
[1:00:17] a church it may be like Joe Joe cried
[1:00:19] out said God show me God put me on a
[1:00:22] scale so I know what have I done wrong
[1:00:24] and God never told him what he did wrong
[1:00:28] God never told him why he was tested him
[1:00:30] in fact there was I think there were 66
[1:00:32] questions God asked him the first one
[1:00:34] was where were you when I laid the
[1:00:36] foundations of the earth he went back
[1:00:40] and started with creation where were you
[1:00:42] and I made the foundation of Jobe speak
[1:00:45] if you know what I'm talking about
[1:00:47] and Jobe said I repent you're greater
[1:00:50] God you're greater than I thought I
[1:00:52] repent in dust and ashes amen
[1:00:54] God never told him why he did this he
[1:00:58] sometimes hurts God's not going to
[1:01:00] answer your prayer he's not gonna answer
[1:01:02] he's not gonna tell you all things but
[1:01:03] as long as you're humble a man as long
[1:01:06] as you know God's great as long as
[1:01:08] you worship is you'll figure it out one
[1:01:10] day praise God but remember that's that
[1:01:12] white stone that white stone with the
[1:01:14] words written on the inside but then
[1:01:16] said that's the mystery that Jesus is
[1:01:18] going to let us know all of our
[1:01:20] unanswered questions all throughout
[1:01:21] eternity
[1:01:22] hey the reward of the white stone that
[1:01:25] mystery inside is that Jesus will answer
[1:01:28] job's question that he didn't quite know
[1:01:32] rather they God for the reward of the
[1:01:34] white stone all these things we don't
[1:01:37] know why did this brother do that why
[1:01:39] did that church go that direction why
[1:01:41] did this happen in my life all these
[1:01:42] things we don't know we get the reward
[1:01:44] of knowing one day thank God for that oh
[1:01:47] we got a lot to look forward to an
[1:01:49] eternity we got all the time in the
[1:01:52] world so we can hear oh that's why God

[1:01:56] pretty soon it'll come to you then you
[1:01:59] get to ask Jesus Jesus you can you
[1:02:02] explain why this happened and he'll
[1:02:05] reveal and that's part of your reward
[1:02:07] oh it's knowing the unsearchable riches
[1:02:09] of Christ amen
[1:02:11] oh thank you Jesus see we're gonna have
[1:02:16] sorrow but this woman says oh it's all
[1:02:19] about me it's all about my church I
[1:02:21] don't mind like I have any problems and
[1:02:24] she lives deliciously verse 8 therefore
[1:02:28] shall her plagues come in one day death
[1:02:30] and mourning and famine and she shall be
[1:02:37] utterly burned with fire out who judges
[1:02:39] her
[1:02:47] you
[1:02:52] of God till they exalt is so far out
[1:02:56] there and she's done so much evil
[1:02:58] remember she does the same thing Jezebel
[1:03:01] did remember that the murders right they
[1:03:04] murdered her in the Inquisition the
[1:03:06] Crusades sexual sins right the Bible
[1:03:09] said Jezebel was guilty of whoredoms so
[1:03:11] who knows what kind of evils sexual sin
[1:03:13] she did I forget the third one but there
[1:03:16] was three of those there where Jezebel
[1:03:19] the natural Jezebel and the spiritual
[1:03:21] Jezebel did the same exact thing let me
[1:03:25] look it up real quick I got it right I
[1:03:27] got it right here in front of me yeah oh
[1:03:29] yeah
[1:03:30] idolatry so sex
[1:03:34] death and idolatry or murder and
[1:03:36] adultery so Jezebel did all three things
[1:03:39] the Roman Catholic Church does the same
[1:03:40] thing my and so God said death and
[1:03:45] mourning and famine for strong as the
[1:03:49] Lord God who judges her amen
[1:03:53] verse 9 now leave this and the kings of
[1:03:56] the earth who have committed fornication
[1:03:57] and lived deliciously with her shall
[1:03:59] bewail her and lament for her when they
[1:04:02] shall see the smoke of her burning this
[1:04:04] is going to be some huge huge burning
[1:04:06] brother branham said thus saith the lord
[1:04:07] though the russian government will drop
[1:04:10] a hydrogen bomb of some sort on the
[1:04:12] vatican right so this is this is part of
[1:04:17] the destruction in one hour hydrogen
[1:04:20] atomic bombs are going to hit the
[1:04:21] Vatican and all the kings of the earth
[1:04:23] committed publication are gonna see that
[1:04:25] smoke rising up and the Bible said that
[1:04:31] they'll lament her when they see her
[1:04:32] smoke of her burning verse 10 standing
[1:04:34] afar off for the fear of her torment
[1:04:35] saying alas alas that great city Babylon
[1:04:38] that mighty City for in one hour is thy
[1:04:40] judgment scum and the merchants of the
[1:04:44] earth shall weep and mourn over her for
[1:04:45] no man buyeth their merchandise anymore
[1:04:48] to see how these merchants must be
[1:04:51] selling into the Catholic Church than
[1:04:52] the Catholic churches and selling them
[1:04:54] out to the their churches that's that's
[1:04:56] the best I can see right now that's what
[1:04:59] it looks like now here it actually tells
[1:05:01] you in verse 12 the merchandise of gold
[1:05:03] and of silver and precious stones and of
[1:05:05] pearls and fine linen and pure purple
[1:05:08] and silk and scarlet and all fine and
[1:05:10] thyine wood and all manner vessels of
[1:05:13] ivory and all matters a most precious
[1:05:14] wood in a brass that of iron and marble
[1:05:16] and cinnamon and odours and ointments
[1:05:18] and frankincense and wine and oil and
[1:05:20] fine flour and wheat and beasts and
[1:05:23] sheep and horses and chariots now
[1:05:25] they're gonna send slaves they got a lot
[1:05:27] of sex slaves in their churches and
[1:05:29] souls of men right see that's where we
[1:05:34] told you the the denominational churches
[1:05:36] many of them just see their church
[1:05:38] members as money that's they're pretty
[1:05:41] nice right they see a person the seat oh
[1:05:44] you know they're now they are given now
[1:05:46] we're gonna make more money
[1:05:47] Athena says God sheep is instead of see
[1:05:51] them as sick people that need to be
[1:05:53] healed in the in the end right with the
[1:05:56] innkeeper who had two prints from Jesus
[1:05:58] instead of seeing them as Lambs instead
[1:06:01] of seeing them as sheep they see them as
[1:06:04] dollar bills amen because that's their
[1:06:11] merchandise the souls of men they make
[1:06:13] merchandise of the souls of men they're
[1:06:16] just a number to them
[1:06:18] how many newcomers do we have this year
[1:06:20] how many more seats do we need all these
[1:06:23] things
[1:06:23] it's merchandise to them verse 14 and
[1:06:28] the fruits that I sold losses after are
[1:06:30] departed from thee and all things which
[1:06:34] were dainty and goodly are departed from
[1:06:36] thee and thou shalt find them no more at
[1:06:38] all the merchants of these things which
[1:06:41] were made rich by her shall stand afar
[1:06:43] off for the fear of her torment weeping
[1:06:45] and wailing now that's what I want to
[1:06:47] look up I want to look up on Google I
[1:06:50] want to look at the Vatican's impact on
[1:06:55] Italy's economy that's what I want to
[1:06:57] look up brother because if atomic bomb
[1:06:59] explodes it over the Vatican you won't
[1:07:03] be able to see that all around the world
[1:07:05] but you'll see it for hundreds of miles
[1:07:07] no doubt and so a lot of their economic
[1:07:11] contacts will be able to see that smoke
[1:07:13] and that fire so I'd like to know the
[1:07:15] Vatican's impact on the economy of Italy
[1:07:19] and then also the neighboring European
[1:07:21] countries because the Bible said they'll
[1:07:23] see it the ones that got rich through
[1:07:25] the Vatican they'll see it and they'll
[1:07:27] royal and no more there goes my money
[1:07:29] there goes my retirement who cares
[1:07:31] heavens our retirement amen your body is
[1:07:34] your glorified body that's your real
[1:07:37] retirement that's Rito no retirement
[1:07:39] Haven that's your inheritance hallelujah
[1:07:41] and the Holy Ghost is just a down
[1:07:44] payment on that inheritance amen I know
[1:07:48] yeah but their soul goes well because
[1:07:50] who cares on the heaven where the
[1:07:53] streets are paved with gold amen the ass
[1:07:56] for the payment is sparing gold amen you
[1:08:01] can
[1:08:01] see through the gold I wonder what's
[1:08:03] underneath the ground there I wonder
[1:08:07] what they see when they look through the
[1:08:08] payment of the transparent gold what do
[1:08:10] they see merci now they're all concerned
[1:08:22] about their merchandise Oh on my
[1:08:24] cinnamon all my gold all my precious
[1:08:27] jewels Oh what's gonna happen to all my
[1:08:28] money they're more concerned about that
[1:08:31] in the Lamb of God Oh see they just want
[1:08:40] an easy life right there dainty they're
[1:08:42] goodly things they want a delicious life
[1:08:44] they want a glorified life they want to
[1:08:46] glorify themselves now let's go down to
[1:08:51] verse 17 I believe we left left there
[1:08:58] well I know let's go to 15 not the
[1:09:00] merchants of these things which were
[1:09:01] made rich by her shall stand afar off
[1:09:03] for the fear of her torment weeping and
[1:09:04] wailing and alas saying alas alas that
[1:09:06] great city that was clothed in fine
[1:09:08] linen now see that's what those priests
[1:09:09] all wear right there were that beautiful
[1:09:10] fine linen I got different colors for
[1:09:13] different seasons we don't went over
[1:09:14] that a few weeks ago and purple and
[1:09:16] scarlet and decked with gold and
[1:09:18] precious stones and pearls for in one
[1:09:23] hour so great riches has come to naught
[1:09:25] and every shipmaster and all the company
[1:09:29] and the ships and sailors and as many as
[1:09:31] trade by his City stood afar off I'd
[1:09:34] like to see that like this know what
[1:09:36] routes they have with ematic in their to
[1:09:38] saying what city is like under this
[1:09:41] great city and they cast dust upon their
[1:09:45] heads and cried weeping and wailing
[1:09:46] saying alas alas that great city wherein
[1:09:49] were made rich all that had ships in the
[1:09:52] sea by reason of her coastlines for in
[1:09:54] one hour she's made desolate see they
[1:09:56] should have been weeping and wailing
[1:09:58] over the sins done in the city a man ha
[1:10:01] ha ha that's what the board does amen
[1:10:03] the bride is marked because she's sighs
[1:10:06] and cries for all the abominations done
[1:10:08] in the city amen but instead she was
[1:10:11] crying about her bank account and her
[1:10:12] money more than crying to verse
[1:10:14] to be safe see the Bible said wherever
[1:10:21] you set your affections on we should set
[1:10:23] them on things above not upon the things
[1:10:25] of the earth so this proves that mine is
[1:10:27] only on fine linen beautiful clothes
[1:10:31] gold and pearls and riches and when they
[1:10:33] see that destroyed they cry but all mine
[1:10:36] their own heaven things and when we see
[1:10:38] people fall to church it makes us cry
[1:10:40] amen glory holiday or when we see us a
[1:10:45] little child give their heart to Jesus
[1:10:47] and baptize them in the name of Lord
[1:10:49] Jesus Christ
[1:10:50] it makes us cry tears of joy because
[1:10:54] that's the eternal reward Amen that's
[1:10:58] what sets our that's what we set our
[1:11:00] affections on Alleluia so see your
[1:11:05] emotions are tied to whatever you set
[1:11:07] your affections on your thoughts write
[1:11:10] your feelings and so see our feelings
[1:11:13] must be on loving God worshiping God and
[1:11:16] also having a burden for people to be
[1:11:18] saved
[1:11:25] alright now I hope you're getting the
[1:11:29] picture just reading this and I'm just
[1:11:30] preaching off my notes here here verse
[1:11:32] 20 rejoice over her now look what it
[1:11:34] says rejoice over her thou heaven 9 now
[1:11:38] picture that I don't know about you but
[1:11:42] when I've seen the videos and the
[1:11:43] pictures of when Hiroshima and Nagasaki
[1:11:45] got bombed in World War two I don't
[1:11:48] rejoice over that I mean I'm glad I'm
[1:11:50] glad we won the war and you know Germany
[1:11:52] and Japan didn't take over the world I'm
[1:11:53] glad about that but I can't rejoice over
[1:11:56] that just because I'm a human and I see
[1:12:01] a hundred thousands of people killed
[1:12:04] instantly by that was atomic bombs
[1:12:06] thousands how many was it you America
[1:12:09] you remember how many ways was it like a
[1:12:11] hundred thousand both cities combined
[1:12:13] and so like you know you and I know and
[1:12:17] our humanity we don't rejoice over that
[1:12:19] but look at heaven
[1:12:21] look what heaven feels when that bomb
[1:12:24] that Russian bomb drops on the Vatican
[1:12:26] the Bible said rejoice Oh
[1:12:28] her thou heaven any holy prophet
[1:12:32] apostles and prophets for God hath
[1:12:34] avenged you on her by this is a whole
[1:12:39] different kind of emotion right this is
[1:12:41] this is a heavenly this is a perfect
[1:12:43] love right this is now the human
[1:12:46] compassion this is a divine love because
[1:12:51] we're we have human compassion you know
[1:12:52] we want to see everybody save we want to
[1:12:54] see everybody healed you know we want to
[1:12:56] see everybody helped and we want to see
[1:12:58] everybody get some kind of help but once
[1:13:01] they got the new bodies in heaven and
[1:13:02] they're up in heaven they know exactly
[1:13:04] what spirits are working on every Church
[1:13:06] right and then when judgment comes upon
[1:13:09] this they greatly rejoice because
[1:13:12] God has taken a revenge right my
[1:13:21] goodness
[1:13:22] verse 21 and a mighty angel took up a
[1:13:25] stone like a great millstone and cast it
[1:13:28] in the sea saying thus with violence
[1:13:29] shall that great city Babylon be thrown
[1:13:31] down and shall be found no more at all
[1:13:33] Amen this city's got the expiration date
[1:13:39] Amen it's gonna have an ending day
[1:13:41] praise God they they call themselves the
[1:13:44] Eternal City
[1:13:45] but that's blessed amen we saw that like
[1:13:47] a few weeks ago that's one of the three
[1:13:49] fold blasphemy there are ninety turn
[1:13:51] there's only one eternal city and that's
[1:13:53] your mother the New Jerusalem amen
[1:13:55] that's your motherland your homeland the
[1:13:58] New Jerusalem so she has an ending point
[1:14:02] verse 22 and Harper's and musicians in
[1:14:05] the Pipers and the trumpeters shall be
[1:14:07] heard no more at all in thee and no
[1:14:09] craftsman of whatsoever craft he be
[1:14:11] shall be found anymore in thee and the
[1:14:14] millstone shall be heard no more at all
[1:14:16] in thee so see it sounds like all these
[1:14:18] Harper's and all this beautiful music
[1:14:21] right that if you go to any Catholic
[1:14:22] Church where they got beautiful music
[1:14:23] organs and pipes and it sounds so
[1:14:26] gorgeous but heavens rejoicing that all
[1:14:30] that false worship is now destroyed amen
[1:14:32] because Jesus said true worship is in
[1:14:36] spirit and in truth they may no matter
[1:14:38] how beautiful it sounds it was not
[1:14:40] according to the truth it
[1:14:42] the file polluted religion amen that's
[1:14:45] right so heaven rejoices I mean no more
[1:14:49] harping no little pipe organs nothing
[1:14:52] wrong with the pipe organ but it's the
[1:14:53] spirit behind it praise God this
[1:14:56] bierbaum is let's glorify ourselves
[1:14:58] let's have no suffering
[1:15:00] let's we're the queen of heaven work we
[1:15:02] know we pray our mother Mary
[1:15:03] that's the spirit behind it and that's a
[1:15:05] wrong spirit so God rejoices over that
[1:15:09] all the prophets rejoice when that gets
[1:15:11] destroyed because it's demonic worship
[1:15:14] verse 23 and the light of a candle shall
[1:15:18] shine no more at all in thee and the
[1:15:20] voice of the bridegroom have the bride
[1:15:24] shall be heard no more at all in thee
[1:15:27] for thy merchants were the great men of
[1:15:31] the earth now that's what's striking
[1:15:32] right there so I've heard this before
[1:15:36] too many of the mote richest men in the
[1:15:38] world are Roman Catholic but I got to
[1:15:40] search it out I don't know for sure
[1:15:41] like I can't prove it like I can say
[1:15:43] well here's the website that's what I
[1:15:44] need to find so you find one give it to
[1:15:46] me so the great man of the earth were
[1:15:49] merchants that soul into the Roman
[1:15:52] Catholic Church for by thy sorceries
[1:15:57] were all nations deceived so America is
[1:16:00] gonna be deceived by the Roman Catholic
[1:16:01] Church Japan Russia Iran right Iran
[1:16:05] North Korea our enemy right Iran our
[1:16:10] enemy they're all gonna be deceived by
[1:16:13] this Antichrist verse 24
[1:16:18] and her was found the blood of the
[1:16:20] prophets and of saints and of Allah this
[1:16:23] is striking Church all that were slain
[1:16:26] upon the earth all my brother William
[1:16:28] that's quite a it's quite a statement
[1:16:29] right there all that we're saying upon
[1:16:32] the earth the punishment for that all
[1:16:35] goes back to the Vatican now that's
[1:16:37] that's striking I think of all the
[1:16:41] people that died thousands die every day
[1:16:43] millions die every year the blood of all
[1:16:46] those that died unjustly goes back on
[1:16:48] the Roman Catholic Church so I don't
[1:16:52] know how that's connected but that's
[1:16:53] what the Bible says so we believe it and
[1:16:56] we want to stay a million miles away
[1:16:58] from that system
[1:16:59] well there have said that Pope and the
[1:17:01] church the Roman Catholic Church is your
[1:17:03] greatest enemy did you know that that's
[1:17:05] your greatest enemy that's not your
[1:17:06] greatest friend that's not even a good
[1:17:08] friend that's your enemy your greatest
[1:17:11] enemy because of idolatry sexual sin
[1:17:16] violence against the true bride of Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ now I got a few things before we
[1:17:22] move on to chapter 19 maybe next week
[1:17:25] now I want to I'll just I'm here let me
[1:17:31] just hit a few
[1:17:32] real quick brother branham said the mark
[1:17:34] of the beast' now let's go the mark of
[1:17:35] the beast because visa the spirit of
[1:17:37] Rome both both marks God's mark and
[1:17:44] Satan's mark bromance that our spiritual
[1:17:46] marks and they can be received today
[1:17:49] even before the Tribulation Period and
[1:17:51] he starts by saying you could receive
[1:17:53] them from the beginning like Cain was
[1:17:55] marked I don't know what physical mark
[1:17:57] he had I was guessing maybe the ears
[1:17:59] because remember the Jews that rejected
[1:18:01] it they got all in the ear maybe it was
[1:18:04] a mark on the forehead I don't know it
[1:18:06] doesn't really matter what it was but
[1:18:08] when every met winnette when men looked
[1:18:09] at him they're like oh I'm not going to
[1:18:10] kill him because of some visual mark
[1:18:14] that he had upon him but remember that
[1:18:17] mark didn't start that way the mark
[1:18:19] started in Cain's heart when God told
[1:18:22] him if you do well you'll rule over your
[1:18:24] brother and he said nonsense and he went
[1:18:27] away and he killed his brother Abel he
[1:18:30] was already marked when he left the
[1:18:31] perfect was of God because the mark of
[1:18:35] the beast is a spiritual mark when you
[1:18:37] turned out and despised and trampled on
[1:18:40] the will of God there's no other man to
[1:18:42] take except the mark of the beast now
[1:18:47] the mark make Holloman a in a computer
[1:18:50] chip or something like that or some
[1:18:53] tattoo on therefore it may culminate in
[1:18:55] that but it's not what's going to start
[1:18:57] it's gonna start as a spiritual mark
[1:19:00] because God's mark is spiritual everyman
[1:19:04] hallelujah see and God gives the mark
[1:19:10] when you obey Him because the acts 5:32
[1:19:13] that he pulled it up acts 5:32 so see
[1:19:16] Satan's mark comes when you disobey God
[1:19:19] for the love when you cross over to the
[1:19:20] reprobate mind but God's mark is receive
[1:19:24] when you obey Him because obedience is
[1:19:27] greater than sacrifice amen see we're
[1:19:32] witnesses of these things and so is also
[1:19:34] the Holy Ghost who God have given to
[1:19:35] them that obey Him Cain couldn't obey
[1:19:38] Him brother Cain went oh man he knew the
[1:19:41] perfect will of God he wouldn't do a
[1:19:43] blood sacrifice so he
[1:19:46] walked away and he got marked
[1:19:47] spiritually he turned out and he made a
[1:19:50] sacrifice within obey obedience is
[1:19:54] greater than sacrifice amen
[1:19:57] I don't care how hard it is don't care
[1:20:00] if it's a you know pressure from your
[1:20:04] family I don't care if it's pressure
[1:20:06] from a boyfriend or a girlfriend or a
[1:20:08] father or parent or a preacher no matter
[1:20:11] what the pressure comes from always obey
[1:20:13] God's Word praise God always obey it
[1:20:17] never compromise and say well I'll do
[1:20:19] this to make up for that never cop the
[1:20:21] Bible said give no provision for the
[1:20:23] flesh make no plans to fulfill the lust
[1:20:26] of your flesh just obey and obedience
[1:20:30] the Bible said in patience you possess
[1:20:32] your soul hey man praise God obey always
[1:20:38] obey the Word of God
[1:20:39] see because at some point when Cain
[1:20:42] chose to disobey he got marked by the
[1:20:45] mark of the beast as well brother BAM
[1:20:49] tells us all she had to do was obey but
[1:20:56] he wouldn't obey and church he spent the
[1:20:59] rest of his life wasting his life
[1:21:01] wandering around like a fugitive and a
[1:21:04] vagabond that was his punishment his
[1:21:07] punish he said the punishments more than
[1:21:09] I came back and God said I'm gonna place
[1:21:10] a mark on you and you're gonna be a huge
[1:21:12] ative and a vagabond he just wonder from
[1:21:15] this church guy say like that he wanted
[1:21:16] from this church to that church to that
[1:21:18] church to that church to that state to
[1:21:20] that state to that County he just
[1:21:22] wandered around see God wants us to be
[1:21:24] solid God wants us to find a hole God
[1:21:27] wants us to be solid and sound and sane
[1:21:29] and faithful praise God amen amen
[1:21:33] it's easy to even like people it's easy
[1:21:36] to hop around you know we have all these
[1:21:38] friends nobody that's here today or
[1:21:40] anything like that but I had all these
[1:21:41] friends that they just they can never
[1:21:43] find a home they hop from that person's
[1:21:45] house and that person's house that that
[1:21:47] person something's wrong with that
[1:21:49] God wants us to be solid god wants to
[1:21:53] provide for us and if you look at their
[1:21:55] lives I've looked at people's lives is
[1:21:56] because they don't obey the Word of God
[1:21:58] see that's a
[1:22:00] like Caine the Bible said you're a
[1:22:01] wandering star the Bible said in Jude I
[1:22:05] just wonder here wonder there and not
[1:22:09] only do they physically wander by there
[1:22:10] and they wonder well wonder if I'm born
[1:22:12] again I wonder if the message is right
[1:22:14] I wondered brother branham's the prophet
[1:22:16] right they just wonder all these things
[1:22:19] instead of saying God open up my heart
[1:22:21] and drop down your revelation amen
[1:22:24] because the Bible said all that ask
[1:22:26] receive amen that's all it takes just
[1:22:30] ask and they'll open it to you you'll
[1:22:33] give it beauty we just got to ask God
[1:22:36] for it see all these vagabond canes
[1:22:39] these Wanderers and fugitives they just
[1:22:41] want to wander around and go every place
[1:22:43] and do everything like that they have no
[1:22:45] accountability first of all and they
[1:22:46] become their own pastor right they
[1:22:50] become their own headship
[1:22:51] that's what Cain Cain was just gonna
[1:22:53] wander around and just be his own pastor
[1:22:56] but God said why don't you be the pastor
[1:22:58] isn't that what basically what he said
[1:22:59] he said you will rule over your brother
[1:23:01] if you just do it God offered him a
[1:23:03] position as a preacher as a ruler just
[1:23:07] like Judas but never said he had the
[1:23:09] highest calling in the Bible an apostle
[1:23:12] there both offer the highest place but
[1:23:15] they'd rather wander around and be a
[1:23:17] fugitive vagabond wrapped and simply
[1:23:19] obeying God's Word
[1:23:21] I don't not you but let's just obey
[1:23:22] God's Word let's just obey God if God
[1:23:25] requires blood let's give them blood if
[1:23:27] God requires the born-again experience
[1:23:29] then let's wait at this altar or wait
[1:23:31] there at your chair until you're born
[1:23:33] again praise God hey amen
[1:23:36] just wait there until your until you
[1:23:38] know I passed from death unto life I'm
[1:23:41] not the same person I was I'm born again
[1:23:44] hallelujah hey man let's just do it
[1:23:47] God's Way let's not take a substitute
[1:23:50] let's not warn there from place to place
[1:23:51] let's be right where your God wants us
[1:23:53] to be
[1:23:54] let's be like post-eternity let's be a
[1:23:56] pillar in the house of God there it is
[1:23:58] I've been waiting for that amen
[1:24:01] that's a reward to you'll be a pillar in
[1:24:04] the house of God not a wonderer
[1:24:08] a pillar in the house of God
[1:24:13] see that's when that mark of the beast
[1:24:15] comes when he said I just want to be a
[1:24:16] vagabond I don't want to submit I don't
[1:24:19] want to submit to God I don't want to
[1:24:20] with God's way I don't want to be around
[1:24:22] my anyone who rule over my brother I
[1:24:24] don't want to take a place of position
[1:24:26] he didn't want to take God's position
[1:24:28] that God had for him in that said God
[1:24:31] had a position you will rule over your
[1:24:33] brother but he didn't even want God's
[1:24:35] position to rule over his shirt I said I
[1:24:37] got his church
[1:24:38] Oh huh see people run from
[1:24:42] responsibility program so that's why I'm
[1:24:44] God don't give people more gifts is
[1:24:46] because he can't trust them with gifts
[1:24:48] because they can't they'll run from it
[1:24:50] rather than that rather than coming up
[1:24:53] here and saying I believe in lord help
[1:24:54] me to be faithful with it they'd rather
[1:24:55] run from it and well Ram said easy
[1:24:58] called this but van said they'd rather
[1:25:00] shirk their responsibilities right
[1:25:04] they'd rather just run from it so they
[1:25:07] don't have to answer for it but listen
[1:25:10] Church your answer one way or the other
[1:25:12] you might as well just face up whatever
[1:25:14] God's called you to do whatever
[1:25:15] responsibility God's giving you you
[1:25:17] might as well just relay yourself before
[1:25:18] the Lord and say Lord Here I am used to
[1:25:20] me praise God don't run from it whatever
[1:25:23] gives you place in my life whatever you
[1:25:25] told me to do here just use me help me
[1:25:28] to be faithful with the talents you've
[1:25:29] given me but can't couldn't do that Cain
[1:25:33] said I don't want your offer God I don't
[1:25:36] need your offer I'm not gonna worship
[1:25:38] the way you want me to worship he turned
[1:25:43] it down
[1:25:43] took the mark of the beast when Cain did
[1:25:50] that he became a reprobate the word
[1:25:52] reprobate means not standing the test
[1:25:54] not approved unfit for see Cain was
[1:25:59] unfit for heaven he was unfit to serve
[1:26:03] God he didn't pass the test
[1:26:07] yes huh me no your life is a test the
[1:26:10] trial of your faith is more precious
[1:26:13] than gold the trial this is a big test
[1:26:15] Church it's a big test a big trial and
[1:26:20] what are you gonna do are you gonna over
[1:26:21] it you're gonna pass the test or fail
[1:26:22] the test we're gonna pass the test with
[1:26:25] flying colors of a sevenfold rainbow
[1:26:27] color not the one got the homosexuals
[1:26:32] are trying to rob it never belong to
[1:26:33] them in the first place it belong to God
[1:26:35] Joseph's coat of many colors amen
[1:26:38] Noah's rainbow covenant that's our
[1:26:40] covenant amen we're gonna pass it with
[1:26:42] flying covers the Covenant of the
[1:26:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost the New
[1:26:47] Covenant amen now let me find out find a
[1:26:54] place to close here got a couple minutes
[1:26:56] here let's just go back let's read
[1:27:02] Exodus 21 6 I'll just close with this
[1:27:04] thought about the market and we'll pick
[1:27:06] it up then next week Lord willing Exodus
[1:27:08] 21 6 this is the all oh that's just my
[1:27:17] that's just my thought maybe Cain had it
[1:27:19] all maybe Cain had a mark on his
[1:27:21] forehead well whatever it was they could
[1:27:23] look it right at this guy and say he's
[1:27:25] I'm not going to touch that guy but God
[1:27:29] chose the all as a mark that all the
[1:27:34] Jews could look at that I want to live
[1:27:38] in slavery he didn't have enough
[1:27:40] responsibility to take his land of his
[1:27:43] forefathers in other words he did a
[1:27:45] disrespect he he denied he didn't want
[1:27:47] the inheritance God had for him just
[1:27:49] like Cain right God had it God had a
[1:27:52] place and inheritance for Cain when he
[1:27:54] turned it down
[1:27:55] I don't want to serve you lord I'd
[1:27:56] rather wander around and do my own thing
[1:27:58] worship how in a worship I'm still mad
[1:28:01] at you God oh my god Church God is slow
[1:28:06] to anger and rich in mercy God is rich
[1:28:10] in mercy God is slow to anger and that
[1:28:14] is
[1:28:14] Master shall bring him under the judges
[1:28:15] he should also bring him to the door
[1:28:17] into the door of the post and his master
[1:28:18] shall Bors ear through with it all and
[1:28:21] he shall serve Him forever
[1:28:24] go to Deuteronomy 1517
[1:28:29] now that was pronounced in Exodus
[1:28:32] Deuteronomy 1517
[1:28:44] see so God even showed a mark on his own
[1:28:49] people that turned down their
[1:28:51] inheritance and refused to possess their
[1:28:56] inheritance now 15:17 is where I want to
[1:29:03] go I'm actually in gold of 16 15 16
[1:29:08] initially used to sanity I will not go
[1:29:11] away from thee because he loveth the in
[1:29:12] thine house because he is well with thee
[1:29:14] then thou shalt taking all and thrust it
[1:29:17] through his ear under the door and he
[1:29:19] shall be thy servant forever and also
[1:29:22] unto thy maidservant thou shalt do
[1:29:24] likewise and it shall not seem hard unto
[1:29:27] thee when thou send us him away free
[1:29:29] from thee for he hath been worth a
[1:29:31] double hired servant to the inn serving
[1:29:34] these six years and the LORD thy God
[1:29:35] shall bless thee and all that I'll do us
[1:29:40] praise God I see Church we know that we
[1:29:45] know the mark in the ear represents in
[1:29:48] the in the New Testament a person that
[1:29:51] will not hear of the gospel trumpet the
[1:29:54] gospel trumpet that says you can be free
[1:29:56] from denomination you can be free from
[1:29:59] worldliness you can be free from sexual
[1:30:03] temptation and you can be free from
[1:30:06] pride hey man you can be free from
[1:30:08] arrogance you be free from greed you can
[1:30:12] be free from all these things but when
[1:30:15] they turn their ear way they don't want
[1:30:17] to hear they don't wanna listen to it
[1:30:18] anymore and they do for the last time
[1:30:21] God marks them in their ear because
[1:30:24] jesus said they have ears but they
[1:30:26] cannot hear praise God
[1:30:28] they have eyes but cannot see ears that
[1:30:32] can I hear see they fell in love with
[1:30:37] their slave master right they fell in
[1:30:39] love the sins of the world
[1:30:41] there are lovers of pleasures more than
[1:30:43] lovers of God right see that's the
[1:30:49] our feet here the church what separates
[1:30:55] us as Christians what separates us from
[1:30:58] the world people should be able to look
[1:31:01] at our lives and tell we don't love the
[1:31:04] world we don't love pleasures we love
[1:31:07] the things of God our lives should be so
[1:31:15] different right lovers of God more than
[1:31:20] lovers of pleasures and if this is God's
[1:31:23] house we should love coming to God's
[1:31:25] house amen
[1:31:28] and anything related to God we should
[1:31:32] love that we should choose to obey God's
[1:31:35] Word he said few there be that find it
[1:31:43] now can you imagine
[1:31:48] let's say it let's pretend your brother
[1:31:50] or sister they got in the debt they got
[1:31:53] sold off just your neighbor's house and
[1:31:56] after the year of Jubilee comes and you
[1:31:59] say hey the gospel trumpet just blowed
[1:32:01] come on over like no I like it here I
[1:32:04] like it here and you look at them and
[1:32:07] they got these big old earrings on and
[1:32:09] yet you see them out there or maybe
[1:32:10] feeding the swine the lowest of the jobs
[1:32:15] they love slavery more than they love
[1:32:19] the responsibility of being a child of
[1:32:21] God they love being a slave to sin oh
[1:32:26] that's let's examine our hearts Church
[1:32:28] let's examine our desires to make sure
[1:32:31] we don't love the things of the world
[1:32:34] that we're not lovers of pleasures but
[1:32:36] we're lovers of God now how much you
[1:32:39] come to the piano here praise the Lord I
[1:32:41] was right on time thank the Lord let's
[1:32:49] bow
[1:32:50] here and I think I'll just take this
[1:32:53] thought here as we close slaves they
[1:32:58] choose to be slaves like Cain he chose
[1:33:01] to be a slave to his own will rather
[1:33:06] than taking the position God had for him
[1:33:08] he rejected it so he could just live how
[1:33:12] he wanted to live
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:20] my I'm meditating on these thoughts of
[1:33:32] the sermon I'm gonna pray and ask the
[1:33:35] Lord to help us set our affections on
[1:33:37] things above that when we cry it'll be
[1:33:42] over spiritual things glory hallelujah
[1:33:50] and that when God asks us to take
[1:33:53] composition when God asks us to have a
[1:33:55] responsibility that will say yes Lord
[1:34:00] when God asks us to obey and not just
[1:34:04] sacrifice but obey will say praise the
[1:34:06] Lord let's pray together Church you know
[1:34:14] in your heart maybe you're even a slave
[1:34:15] to a certain attitude maybe been a slave
[1:34:18] to a certain fleshly lust or lust of the
[1:34:22] eyes are but a slave to pride
[1:34:25] how are the holy spirits deal with you
[1:34:27] let's pray tonight maybe you got your
[1:34:30] affections off the thing God made for
[1:34:33] lost souls but spray that our pleasures
[1:34:42] will be in the house of God doing the
[1:34:44] things of God we've seen how the false
[1:34:49] church glorified herself let's try to
[1:34:53] glorify Christ father in heaven we thank
[1:34:56] you Lord God for this word what a
[1:35:00] calling you give in the true church the

[1:35:08] what's the glorify yourself
[1:35:10] Oh God
[1:35:14] doesn't want to take responsibility like
[1:35:16] cainy doesn't want to take the position

[1:35:22] name

[1:35:25] be true worshipers Lord none will suffer
[1:35:28] for it
[1:35:28] but yeah it'll be accepted in the eyes

[1:42:59] to share before we close I don't know if
[1:43:02] I told you but I had a friend who robbed
[1:43:04] a bank years ago and he's been in prison
[1:43:06] for ten years I said in my book and he
[1:43:10] said I received your book so far it's
[1:43:11] truly an awesome book I read a chapter a
[1:43:13] day I can study it when I'm reading it
[1:43:15] able to digest the knowledge and then he
[1:43:19] says he said God truly blessed you
[1:43:25] you're using the gifts he gave you in an
[1:43:26] awesome way you're doing God's work by
[1:43:28] writing this book because it's opening
[1:43:30] my eyes a lot he's in prison he has
[1:43:32] nowhere to go he says he says I'm
[1:43:34] currently on chapter six and my whole
[1:43:36] perception of a person's appearance has
[1:43:38] been forever changed in prison what a
[1:43:43] blessing you know what the challenge is
[1:43:46] since I've been reading your book the
[1:43:47] lust he said Hayat lust of the eyes he
[1:43:51] said he said your book has taken it to
