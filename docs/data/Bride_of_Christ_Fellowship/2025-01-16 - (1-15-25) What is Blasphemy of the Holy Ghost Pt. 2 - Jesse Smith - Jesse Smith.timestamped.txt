[0:00] I got some good feedback even online
[0:02] somebody there's one comment on the
[0:04] sermon from Sunday it said this was a
[0:05] beautiful message from start to finish
[0:07] so I said praise the Lord I kept
[0:09] studying on that I was going to make a
[0:10] video on it this morning but then I got
[0:12] finding more quotes and I didn't have
[0:13] enough time to make a video on it so I
[0:15] was going to preach a part two I try
[0:17] this to be a blessing to you amen it's a
[0:19] great encouragement to know uh you're
[0:21] saved Hallelujah and when the devil
[0:24] tries to whisper your lost or you cross
[0:26] the line you can come back with the word
[0:28] of God cuz really it's going boil down
[0:30] to that who do we believe the liar or do
[0:33] believe the
[0:34] truth let's believe the way the truth
[0:37] and the life he has a name his name is
[0:40] Jesus Hallelujah Matthew
[0:43] 12:43 and I love what brother Ram said
[0:45] his great love for god brother Bram said
[0:46] even if God would send me to hell I'd
[0:48] still love him in hell but see the the
[0:51] Lost can't do that they don't love God
[0:53] remember they hate to retain God in
[0:54] their knowledge so even in brother Ram's
[0:56] testimony God would never send him there
[0:59] right because he loved loves God the
[1:01] people that go to hell are the people
[1:02] that don't want to be with God how many
[1:05] want to be with God in heaven Hallelujah
[1:06] for eternity well you're going to be
[1:07] there by God's grace you just trust the
[1:09] word of the Lord hallelujah so God bless
[1:11] you let's go to Matthew 12 now I want to
[1:13] read this because uh it's going to just
[1:16] U apply a little
[1:20] later and I I might even share a little
[1:22] testimony from brother Chris you know he
[1:23] was he and I were text in last week that
[1:26] video of that man I might share that
[1:27] just a little testimony how it's such an
[1:29] inspiration
[1:30] and how God can use people like that
[1:32] which is really
[1:34] wonderful yes amen I love that you know
[1:37] when God anoints somebody man or woman
[1:39] you know to testify it stirs us up I
[1:42] love that God can use that by God's
[1:44] grace so I might share that it's a this
[1:46] is part of this here too okay Matthew
[1:48] 12:43 uh I'll read 4344 then we can all
[1:51] read 45 together by God's grace when the
[1:54] unclean spirit is gone out of a man he
[1:57] walketh through Dry places seeking rest
[1:59] and findeth none I'm going to pause
[2:01] right there so I gave my testimony I had
[2:03] some evil spirit that was causing me to
[2:05] be addicted to lots of evil things like
[2:07] tobacco was one of them we went over
[2:09] last week chewing tobacco that was a
[2:10] spirit some type of a spirit to kill my
[2:13] body right to get me to have cancer some
[2:15] type of evil spirit well that Spirit
[2:17] left but no doubt it tried to come back
[2:19] right and so whatever Spirit someone
[2:21] might have you know lust of the eyes
[2:23] lust of the F flesh pride of life
[2:25] alcohol Drugs porn whatever it is that
[2:27] spirit will leave but then it's going to
[2:29] try to come back so we got to be ready
[2:31] when it comes back now for you little
[2:34] ones maybe it wouldn't be something like
[2:35] that but maybe it be lying stealing
[2:38] dishonesty right uh
[2:41] disrespect something like that some type
[2:43] of a sin like a pride thing and you you
[2:46] get deliverance from it you know as far
[2:47] as it'll battle your mind you get
[2:49] Deliverance but you got to be ready it's
[2:50] going to come back you got to be ready
[2:52] to fight verse 44 then he saith I'll
[2:56] return into my house from whence I came
[2:58] out and when he is come he findeth it
[3:00] empty swept and garnished notice he
[3:03] finds it clean but he doesn't find it
[3:05] filled and that's the difference you
[3:07] know whatever area we struggle with once
[3:09] that spirit's gone we got to fill our
[3:12] mind with scriptures to combat that evil
[3:14] spirit we got to fill it fill our minds
[3:17] with truth and here's how you overcome
[3:19] this here's how you stay free here's how
[3:21] you get the victory you got to fill your
[3:23] mind with something if you don't the
[3:24] devil will get right back in now let's
[3:27] all read verse 45 on three 1 2 three
[3:30] then goeth he and taketh with himself
[3:33] seven other Spirits more wicked than
[3:36] himself and they enter in and dwell
[3:39] there and the last state of that man is
[3:42] worse than the first even so shall it be
[3:45] also unto this wicked generation let's
[3:48] have one more word of prayer let's bow
[3:49] our heads if you have a need on your
[3:50] heart let's make it known unto God God
[3:51] sees all the hands you're Defying
[3:53] Gravity you're defying tiredness you're
[3:55] defying all these things trying to do a
[3:57] spiritual thing Lord God you see the
[3:59] hands Lord I pray you minister to them
[4:00] Lord you see the hearts of those that
[4:02] even maybe can't raise their hands Lord
[4:04] you know the needs of your people I pray
[4:05] you speak to them Lord I'm nothing I uh
[4:07] you give me enough Grace to know I I'm
[4:09] nothing Lord so take control of my
[4:11] vessel use my lips use my tongue my
[4:13] thoughts and Lord speak your word Lord
[4:15] you didn't call mechanical devices to
[4:17] preach the gospel or Angels or the wind
[4:19] or waves or something like that but you
[4:21] called men fallible men to preach your
[4:24] infallible word Lord so do what only you
[4:26] can do here tonight Lord and minister to
[4:28] your people I ask it Lord feed your
[4:30] sheep strengthen them if anyone needs
[4:31] Deliverance may they be set free tonight
[4:34] in Jesus Christ's name I ask it and the
[4:36] Saints said amen God bless you as you're
[4:38] being seated praise God I want to do a
[4:39] quick review uh real quick by God's
[4:42] grace just hit some of the scriptures
[4:43] from Sunday we looked at the context of
[4:45] Matthew 12 uh Jesus was talking about
[4:48] Idle Words and that doesn't apply to us
[4:50] because we're forgiven of all of our
[4:52] sins praise God we've already passed
[4:54] from death into life there's no
[4:55] condemnation you know my my wife kind of
[4:57] made me laugh this week she said I went
[4:59] I went to bed one night I was quoting
[5:01] scriptures I was quoting 1 Thessalonians
[5:04] 5:9 I think it was maybe Sunday night or
[5:05] Monday night and I just went to bed
[5:07] quoting that scripture uh for God ha not
[5:10] appointed me unto wrath but to obtain
[5:12] salvation through Christ Jesus our lord
[5:14] I went to bed saying that and my wife
[5:15] kind of made me laugh she said uh she
[5:17] woke up during the middle of night and I
[5:18] was praying in in my
[5:20] sleep that's how I want to go to heaven
[5:23] right there so I hope I passed away if
[5:25] if I live to be along like
[5:27] 120 hopefully I hope when I pass over
[5:31] that's when I pass over when I'm praying
[5:32] in my sleep and I was mumbling some
[5:34] things and I said and by your grace and
[5:35] mercy
[5:37] amen so I told Malachi I said that's hey
[5:40] that's what I want to start I do I want
[5:41] to remember to do that every night pray
[5:43] at pray myself to sleep by God's grace
[5:46] so we want to do that by God's grace but
[5:47] remember friends you won't be judged for
[5:49] Idle Words because you're forgiven of
[5:51] them the blood of Christ forgives all
[5:54] sins now of course we'll we'll we'll
[5:56] deal with any punishment here or any any
[5:58] chastisement here it'll just be small of
[6:00] course and uh but God will he will not
[6:03] hold any he will not lay anything to our
[6:04] charge because we're forgiven
[6:07] Hallelujah and then we looked at the
[6:09] reprobate scriptures uh we will not be
[6:11] rejected we are accepted in the Beloved
[6:13] Hallelujah we are the elect the chosen
[6:15] before the foundation of the world
[6:17] because we want to be like the Lord
[6:18] Jesus Christ and then we saw brother R
[6:21] Define uh blasphemy just in modern terms
[6:24] it's make fun of the Holy Ghost it's
[6:26] it's speak evil against the Holy Ghost
[6:28] he said it's calling the works of God
[6:30] the works of the devil he gives us like
[6:32] a more modern or maybe easy uh way to
[6:35] understand it and then we saw how Paul
[6:38] blasphemed um uh the Holy Ghost uh Jesus
[6:42] even after uh the crucifixion and yet he
[6:45] was still forgiven he was the chief of
[6:48] Sinners so he's the pattern if God can
[6:50] save the lowest God can save you and I
[6:52] so don't ever think God don't have power
[6:54] to save you God can save to the
[6:55] uttermost Hallelujah because he already
[6:58] saved the chiefest the wickedest of
[7:00] Sinners according to the infallible
[7:02] Bible
[7:03] Hallelujah and then we looked at
[7:05] different examples of people that have
[7:07] left the presence of God we saw how the
[7:09] Jews
[7:09] blasphemed and uh we'll we'll kind of
[7:12] pick up there now I I think it was God's
[7:14] grace but I didn't finish the story of
[7:16] the Lutheran Dean so I'm going to finish
[7:18] that here as we start part
[7:20] two I almost texted that for everybody
[7:22] but then I forgot you know by God's
[7:23] grace and we ended with that quote
[7:25] that's a beautiful quote so I'm going to
[7:27] start with that the quote was uh there's
[7:28] a woman she's weeping that light fell
[7:31] right over her what makes her act like
[7:33] that that woman's been so nervous till
[7:35] the Devils even tried to tell her she's
[7:37] cross the separating line that's right
[7:39] Blackness hangs around her but she's
[7:41] healed now so see the Holy Ghost will go
[7:43] to people that are hurting and Inspire
[7:46] them anoint them and set them free
[7:48] Hallelujah and she was crying tears of
[7:50] joy oh I am saved Hallelujah Jesus Loves
[7:53] Me I came here to listen to God's
[7:56] Prophet Hallelujah so how could I be
[7:57] lost I want to hear God's prophet and
[7:59] she gets healed while listening to God's
[8:01] Prophet so beautiful beautiful uh quote
[8:04] there Hallelujah now here's the ones
[8:06] that were I also read previously you say
[8:08] brother brandom I've been so sinful I
[8:10] believe I've crossed a separating line
[8:12] no you haven't or you wouldn't be here
[8:14] tonight how can he make atonement for me
[8:17] I broke my marriage vows I've done this
[8:18] that the other but the man said he's
[8:20] Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided
[8:22] sacrifice if you're beyond hope if
[8:24] you've broken every commandment if
[8:25] you've done everything there is in the
[8:27] Bible that you ought not to do but
[8:29] besides blasing the Holy Ghost God has a
[8:31] sacrifice provided for you he's Jehovah
[8:34] Gyra he Alters all circumstances
[8:37] Hallelujah and then the last one here is
[8:39] maybe you think you've crossed a
[8:40] separating line you can't be saved
[8:42] that's wrong as long as you got enough
[8:44] God about you to come here to this
[8:46] church tonight there's hopes for you to
[8:48] be saved so as long as a spirit of God's
[8:52] dealing with you think about that church
[8:54] did God deal with you at any time this
[8:55] week oh you shouldn't have thought that
[8:57] you shouldn't have said that shouldn't
[8:58] have went there should bought that right
[9:01] if God shouldn't have watch that right
[9:02] if God dealt with you one time he's
[9:04] still dealing with you Hallelujah proves
[9:06] you're saved now let me finish the quote
[9:09] I I didn't get to finish the Lutheran
[9:10] quote I I showed how brother R prayed
[9:12] for he and he said brother baxer prayed
[9:14] for 72 college students and church they
[9:16] were all on their knees facing uh the
[9:19] wall they were all lined up against the
[9:20] wall praying fill me with the Holy Ghost
[9:22] fill me with the Holy Ghost and brother
[9:23] said they went on laid hands on every
[9:25] person and every one of them got the
[9:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[9:29] Hallelujah we got to get down to
[9:30] business with God hallelujah like I told
[9:32] you before I got the Holy Ghost I'd cry
[9:34] out for it I'd go up and have prayer
[9:35] meetings all by myself in my upper room
[9:38] expecting to see angels and then God God
[9:40] gives me the Holy Ghost the day after I
[9:42] get married
[9:43] hallelujah hallelujah so we thank God
[9:46] for his Amazing Grace just keep crying
[9:48] out to God hallelujah now here's the
[9:50] ending to it brother Braham said I went
[9:53] laying hands on each one and all 72
[9:56] students and the dean receive the
[10:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost now remember
[10:02] what did this man do he called brother
[10:04] brandham a devil worker
[10:07] souser right so this is a great example
[10:11] of how a Believer can say harsh words
[10:14] out of
[10:15] ignorance and yet God will forgive their
[10:18] ignorance when they call the work of God
[10:21] the work of
[10:22] Satan now look now look how look how
[10:24] this man was hungry for God he drove
[10:27] through a snowstorm to he brother random
[10:29] and then that wasn't enough when he got
[10:30] discouraged he wrote him a 20-some page
[10:33] letter and then that was enough then I
[10:35] want a face- to-face meeting see if
[10:37] someone really loves God they're going
[10:39] to keep going after God until God shows
[10:41] them the truth
[10:43] hallelujah see look see all of his
[10:45] actions proof he wants the truth he's
[10:46] hungry for truth so God can look on his
[10:49] ignorance of saying that evil thing it
[10:51] was a completely Blasphemous thing but
[10:53] just like Paul God had ignorance I'm
[10:56] sorry God had mercy on him because he
[10:58] was ignorant he just didn't know enough
[10:59] and church all of us fall into that
[11:01] category in some ways tonight we're
[11:03] probably ignorant of something God's
[11:05] going to teach us in the future so we
[11:07] better watch our words uh and just be
[11:10] humble and be open to correction because
[11:13] we don't know it all I don't know it all
[11:15] nobody knows it all except our savior
[11:17] knows it all
[11:20] Hallelujah and brother Ram brother Ram
[11:22] even forgave him and said I'll forgive
[11:24] you for calling me a souser and the
[11:26] Bible gives you authority to do that
[11:28] whosoever sins you remit they'll be
[11:30] remitted so Church think of your loved
[11:32] ones that have spoken evil things pray
[11:34] for them and ask God to forgive them and
[11:37] tell them if you get a chance tell them
[11:38] I forgive you for saying that
[11:41] Hallelujah we must we must remember to
[11:43] do that now I'm going to give a a simple
[11:45] Bible foundation and I'm going to be
[11:47] heavy quotes tonight all right so
[11:49] hopefully you write down some of these
[11:50] quotes go look them up you'll like them
[11:52] I'm going to eventually Lord willing
[11:53] make a video on this and then you can
[11:54] just listen to brother tell all these
[11:56] wonderful
[11:57] stories good I got 45 minutes to rec
[11:59] quotes all right glory to God
[12:01] hallelujah now think about these people
[12:04] that that are blasing the Holy Ghost
[12:06] Cain left the presence of God did he
[12:08] ever return no that's proof he he he
[12:11] Blas him the Holy
[12:13] Ghost right that's proof that's one of
[12:15] the proofs he left the presence of God
[12:18] Genesis 4 never came back Judas left the
[12:22] presence of Jesus did he ever come back
[12:24] no never came back everybody see a
[12:26] pattern here brother Chris you got a
[12:28] question
[12:36] yeah he has died yeah he was a werer
[12:41] yeah right no good good it was for his
[12:44] life but he lived a long time he
[12:46] probably lived probably lived over 900
[12:47] years probably some some I don't know if
[12:48] the Bible actually gives the number of
[12:50] years yeah like all his contemporaries
[12:53] around him Liv 900 some years so he had
[12:56] an awful existence because he left the
[12:57] presence of God great question question
[13:00] and so uh 1 John 21:19 John says don't
[13:03] worry about don't worry about the
[13:04] serpent seed Church they'll go out from
[13:06] us because they are not of us I just
[13:09] gave you two examples the serpent seed
[13:10] will not remain in the presence of God
[13:12] look at all these people leaving the
[13:13] message and I'm not I don't know God I
[13:14] don't know where they stand with God but
[13:16] if they blaspheme it and they don't get
[13:18] right with God something shows their
[13:21] they're showing their colors in other
[13:22] words because brother baham preached the
[13:24] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[13:25] Jesus Christ brother Braham re uh point
[13:28] us back to to the lie I'm sorry back to
[13:30] the truth uh that God's one person not
[13:33] three and if they leave and call God
[13:35] three persons and they leave and
[13:36] fornicate and adultery all these things
[13:38] like that their their actions prove
[13:40] which side they're on and if they
[13:42] blaspheme the Holy Ghost and don't
[13:44] repent and and it wasn't done ignorantly
[13:47] well that shows what side they're on as
[13:48] well
[13:50] Hallelujah so notice they went out from
[13:53] us just like Cain just like Judas
[13:55] because they were not of us hallelujah
[13:58] for if they been of us they would have
[14:00] no doubt have continued with us for they
[14:02] went out that they might be made
[14:03] manifest that they were not of all us
[14:05] see see uh God Likens us unto either a
[14:07] wheat seed or a tear right eventually
[14:10] we're going to manifest which side we're
[14:12] on Amen and that's what he says here and
[14:14] so the Gathering Together to church is
[14:16] so important the church you go to is so
[14:19] important because it shows which side
[14:20] you're on Hallelujah that's according in
[14:23] the
[14:23] Bible uh pull up Luke 4 Jesus never
[14:27] missed church he was always in church
[14:29] that was his his habit was to always
[14:30] come to church I don't remember the
[14:33] verse I think it's around 16 but I could
[14:34] be
[14:36] wrong maybe it's 13 his custom was
[14:39] always to be in the house of the Lord oh
[14:42] 16 yes 4:16 and he came up to Nazareth
[14:44] where he' been brought up and as his
[14:46] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[14:48] the Sabbath day and stood up to read now
[14:50] Jesus had good Customs he had good
[14:51] Traditions do you think he ever skipped
[14:52] Church no no he was always in his
[14:55] father's house Hallelujah so again the
[14:58] sinners will leave the Gathering of the
[15:00] True Believers the serpent seed will
[15:02] leave the Gathering of True Believers
[15:04] but the seed of God will stay with the
[15:07] Believers now people can leave our
[15:09] church if they disagree with me that's
[15:10] fine but just go to a good
[15:12] church right now if you came against me
[15:15] you you know I'm going to preach on you
[15:16] after you
[15:17] leave that's what Jesus did Jesus did
[15:20] don't you know these Pharisees did this
[15:21] don't you know Judas did this don't you
[15:23] know that because people have to know
[15:25] what sin is and what righteousness is
[15:28] that's that's right now Judas left
[15:31] church Judas the Scar left and then on
[15:33] the day of Pentecost how many got the
[15:35] holy ghost out of the
[15:36] 120 all very good let's say all ready
[15:40] all everybody there got it hallelujah
[15:42] amen what a promise amen the elect were
[15:45] in one place and one Accord and if
[15:48] that's the second Exodus what about the
[15:50] Third Exodus
[15:51] hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah
[15:55] what a blessing what a confirmation it
[15:57] gives us God's going to drive out all
[16:00] the goats so that the sheep can remain
[16:02] in the Sheepfold
[16:04] Hallelujah now this is and this is not
[16:06] with any uh bitterness but I just heard
[16:09] back today from bradam Tabernacle the
[16:12] the structure we visited uh Victoria and
[16:14] Caris it's been finished for a long time
[16:17] that multi-millions probably tens of
[16:20] millions of dollars have built that uh
[16:22] Tabernacle and I said I just said is it
[16:24] finished and are you gathering together
[16:27] and the answer was yes it's been
[16:28] finished
[16:29] but the pastor doesn't feel led to
[16:31] gather
[16:32] physically and I thought that's so sad
[16:35] you spent millions of dollars for
[16:38] what the people need a place of
[16:41] worship so the per the pastor doesn't
[16:44] feel led well the word never lead you
[16:47] that
[16:48] way and your dad brother brandham never
[16:51] LED you that way so who's leading you
[16:54] that's a good question I believe it's an
[16:56] evil spirit but I've got the word and
[16:59] the prophet to agree with me Hallelujah
[17:02] and remember those who follow the
[17:03] prophet will be doing like revelation 22
[17:06] the spirit and the bride and the prophet
[17:09] will all be saying the same thing and
[17:11] the same thing will already been said in
[17:13] the word of God hallelujah oh church we
[17:15] ought to be encouraged tonight we're the
[17:16] bride
[17:17] Hallelujah we stay with the word
[17:20] hallelujah people can say whatever they
[17:22] want and I appreciate the brother for
[17:23] sharing I said thank you God bless you I
[17:25] always said I said thanks for sharing
[17:26] that with me but it just reveals
[17:29] what what kind of thinking is that for
[17:32] someone remember just to compromise on
[17:34] one word look at all the sin we got
[17:36] today from Eve now Adam has a part in
[17:38] that but look and to compromise on that
[17:41] then that's just one of those I made a
[17:42] video with 24 24 sins that's just one of
[17:45] them there's 23
[17:47] more Hallelujah didn't the Bible say a
[17:50] little leav Lev's the whole lump Glory
[17:53] now I'm off of that now okay you can
[17:54] relax now God can handle our harsh words
[17:58] remember this I preached on this a while
[17:59] ago job said some really harsh things
[18:01] about God I'm just going to do one but
[18:03] job
[18:04] 33:12 job was harsh against God and Joe
[18:08] and David was harsh against God and God
[18:11] forgave them you know what God can
[18:13] handle your mind
[18:15] battles God can handle your bad
[18:19] words right like I gave you the example
[18:21] of me growing up and this uh this friend
[18:24] who said uh that those words on Sunday
[18:26] about the Holy Ghost just just in
[18:28] ignorance
[18:29] right but that person I could I could
[18:31] take that person I could show you in
[18:32] that person's life they're so faithful
[18:34] to God they make such sacrifices to God
[18:40] maybe more than me maybe more than me
[18:43] and I'm not saying I got a lot but I'm
[18:44] just saying I'm a pastor I'm supposed to
[18:45] make sacrifices for God that doesn't
[18:47] mean I'm perfect or anything or I'm so
[18:49] great a person I'm not I'm the least of
[18:50] the pastors that's why I got a small
[18:52] church amen that's the way I look at it
[18:55] but I could show you and say my what a
[18:59] testimony and in one moment of weakness
[19:01] or one moment of being in the flesh do
[19:03] you think that one moment will will will
[19:05] will negate all these other things all
[19:08] these other proofs that the person's a
[19:10] real believer of course not one little
[19:13] moment and then the person's like I'm
[19:15] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Lord forgive
[19:16] me forgive me do you think God will hold
[19:17] that against a person absolutely
[19:21] not God remembers we're just dust right
[19:24] there's a part of us that's just dust
[19:26] there's a part of us that's Fallen
[19:28] Hallelujah
[19:29] God wants to see us humble ourselves and
[19:31] repent but look at this behold in this
[19:34] Thou Art not just so job's on Earth
[19:36] saying God you're not
[19:39] fair what the the judge of
[19:42] Eternity the judge of Heaven he sticks
[19:46] up his finger said you're not just I
[19:48] will answer the that I will answer thee
[19:50] that God is greater than
[19:53] man there's so many and and remember
[19:55] Allah who rebukes him I I didn't get
[19:57] through all the scriptures but Allah who
[19:59] has to rebuke him you're exalting
[20:01] yourself above
[20:03] God church he called himself greater
[20:06] than God he's more fair than God a man a
[20:10] Believer and then in heaven God's saying
[20:12] he's perfect he's perfect now how can
[20:14] you be perfect only by the blood
[20:17] hallelujah how can you be perfect how
[20:19] can you go to heaven only by the blood
[20:21] sacrifice of Jesus Christ
[20:24] Hallelujah and yet in heaven God already
[20:26] recognized him as perfect because the
[20:28] blood and because God sees him as a
[20:30] finished product but then God's got to
[20:32] come down and say who is
[20:34] this God God's quoting his name in
[20:36] heaven to the devil God's bragging about
[20:38] him in heaven and then comes down to
[20:39] earth and say who are you God likes to
[20:41] keep us
[20:42] humble Hallelujah but on in heaven Your

[21:05] times now we're not going to read but
[21:06] Psalm 22 David said why have you
[21:08] forsaken me did God forsake Him no but
[21:11] David's telling God you forsook me I'm
[21:14] sorry God doesn't do
[21:17] that verse uh Psalm 55:2 attend unto me
[21:21] and hear me I mourn in my complaint and

[21:44] noises we shouldn't

[21:55] ignorant they never met in other country
[21:57] so they wouldn't know uh Psalm 771 I
[22:00] Cried unto God with my voice even unto
[22:02] God with my voice and he gave here unto
[22:03] me in the day of my trouble I sought the
[22:05] Lord my sord ran in the night and ceased

[22:15] say you think God can uh forgive Asaf
[22:18] for that sure yeah y every Believers
[22:22] complain sometimes and what's the
[22:24] difference between complaining and then
[22:26] lying like Abraham what's it I mean it's
[22:27] still sin
[22:30] right Psalm 102 verse1 a prayer of The
[22:33] Afflicted when he's overwhelmed and
[22:35] porth out his complaint before the Lord
[22:37] hear my prayer oh Lord and let my cry
[22:40] come unto
[22:41] thee it's okay to say sometimes I
[22:43] complain to God but just remember at the
[22:46] end of it say God be merciful to me
[22:48] cause me to Hope in your promise cause
[22:51] me to look past my current circumstances
[22:54] help me to raise up in faith with eagle
[22:55] eyes and see beyond my circumstance and
[22:58] know that I'll get through this
[23:00] eventually by your grace hallelujah amen
[23:04] Psalm 142 ver1 a prayer of David a
[23:07] prayer when he was in the cave I Cried

[23:11] voice un the Lord did I make my
[23:12] supplication I poured out my complaint
[23:15] before him I showed him my trouble when
[23:17] my spirit was overwhelmed within me then
[23:19] thou knewest my path in the way wherein
[23:22] I walked have they privily laid a snare
[23:24] for me so see when we feel overwhelmed
[23:27] we can pour pour out our complaint we
[23:29] can pour out our feelings to God and as
[23:31] long as we have respect for God as long
[23:33] as and even if we make a mistake God
[23:35] will forgive us hallelujah because we'll
[23:38] ask for God's forgiveness we'll feel the
[23:40] pole of the Holy Spirit see it's the
[23:43] holy spirit that moves on you and says
[23:45] oh I'm sorry Lord forgive me that's
[23:46] God's spirit praise God if you didn't
[23:48] have the spirit of God in your life you
[23:50] wouldn't ask for it praise God thank God
[23:52] you got it

[24:12] Elijah oh maybe you're God sleeping out
[24:15] there well now I don't know if this is
[24:17] David's Psalm or not I forgot to look
[24:18] that
[24:19] up but the the the prayer is like God uh
[24:22] could you wake up and hear
[24:24] me do you think God's taking a nap right
[24:27] now do God I get tired on a Wednesday
[24:29] night have to take a nap look at the
[24:32] prayer of this
[24:33] guy Lord uh could you wake up and help
[24:35] me isn't that a little
[24:38] disrespectful but yet it's in the Psalms
[24:41] for us to learn from sometimes we think
[24:44] God sleeping God's not
[24:46] sleeping but God lets us utter foolish
[24:50] things God lets us utter sinful things
[24:53] to correct
[24:54] us and to teach us for the next time
[24:57] around
[24:59] uh why you sleeping God Arise cast not
[25:01] us off forever oh oh so now God's cast
[25:03] me
[25:04] off no God's never cast us off but we
[25:08] complain like he has and yet God has
[25:11] Mercy on
[25:12] us wherefore do thou hide thy face does
[25:15] God hide his face from us no the thing
[25:17] is we leave God's face it's not God
[25:21] God's always there God's always ready to
[25:22] forgive pardon quick to Pardon we're the
[25:25] ones yeah go God's always knocking can I
[25:28] ask some fellowship good brother you got
[25:30] the knocking sign there God always wants
[25:32] to come in and have Su with us
[25:35] hallelujah uh and Lord did you hide your
[25:38] face and forget our Affliction did you
[25:39] forget me God did God forget us Church
[25:44] think of these things think of the words
[25:46] that come out of our mouths Lord you
[25:47] forget me you're sleeping didn't hear my
[25:50] prayer no the Bible tells us when he
[25:52] doesn't hear our prayers when we ask
[25:54] selfishly every other time he hears it
[25:59] my soul is bowed down to the dust and my
[26:01] our belly cleaveth under the
[26:03] Earth I'll stop right there
[26:08] five uh Psalm 10 verse1 why standest
[26:11] thou a far off oh Lord why hidest thou
[26:13] myself or thyself in times of trouble so
[26:16] it's almost like God when I need you God
[26:18] you go hide yourself and you don't want
[26:20] to help
[26:22] me like we're fighting this fight all by
[26:25] ourselves uh no we're fighting a battle
[26:27] that's already been one hallelujah
[26:30] praise God Amen sometimes in our
[26:32] foolishness we utter well God left me
[26:34] and I'm just here all by
[26:38] myself I'm I'm I'm just out there like
[26:40] David no Christ was in David the
[26:42] anointing was on David
[26:45] hallelujah we're never
[26:47] alone but yet sometimes we act like it
[26:50] sometimes we say it out loud is God
[26:52] going to forgive us of that yeah you
[26:54] better believe it of course God's going
[26:57] to forgive us of that
[27:03] Psalm 13:1 and I'm going to move on hope
[27:05] this a good review for you by God's
[27:07] grace let's be careful what we say about
[27:09] God God's not asking for Perfection he's
[27:12] asking us for humility and then he's
[27:14] asking for Christlike character
[27:15] Hallelujah obey the word next time to
[27:20] the chief musician a Psalm of David how
[27:22] long wilt thou Forget Me Oh Lord forever
[27:28] what a thing to say God's forgot me are
[27:31] you going to always forget me for the
[27:32] rest of my life Lord now the truth is
[27:35] God never forgot him how long will thy
[27:38] hide they hide thy face from me oh yeah
[27:41] I see God you don't you're just hiding
[27:42] your face and I'm praying but you're
[27:43] hiding you're either sleeping or went
[27:45] off
[27:46] somewhere no that's not the kind of God
[27:48] he
[27:49] is he's the faithful God he's a loving
[27:52] God hallelujah he's like a father that
[27:56] pies his children
[28:02] Glory so we see church that we sometimes
[28:05] utter things that are
[28:09] foolish there's a scripture uh yeah go
[28:12] to uh Jeremiah 29 here this is
[28:21] a familiar
[28:25] one then I'm going to look up a quick
[28:28] verse
[28:42] here all right there it is Glory
[28:44] Hallelujah all right okay Jeremiah
[28:47] 29 look at verse 11 for I know the
[28:50] thoughts that I think toward you sayth
[28:52] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[28:54] evil to give you an expected end in
[28:57] other words if you love God God's going
[28:59] to give you an expected end you're
[29:01] you're going to know where you're going
[29:03] there's not going to be any surpris on
[29:05] the day of judgment for us hallelujah
[29:07] because you know God God God knows you
[29:09] God loves you he's going to tell you
[29:11] exactly where you're going to go
[29:12] Hallelujah going to heaven Hallelujah
[29:15] but what's your job Church verse 12 and
[29:17] 13 is your job and 14 then shall you
[29:20] call upon me and you shall go and pray
[29:21] unto me and I'll hearken to you and you
[29:23] shall seek me and find me when you
[29:24] search for me with all your heart see
[29:27] what your job to seek God with
[29:29] everything you got every Sunday yes
[29:32] every Wednesday yes I'm giving him
[29:34] everything I got
[29:35] Hallelujah I got to go to work I gotta
[29:37] eat I got to do all these things I got
[29:39] to make food I got to take care of my
[29:40] children I got all these things but with
[29:42] everything else that I got I'm G to give
[29:44] that to God
[29:45] hallelujah verse 14 and I'll be F found
[29:48] of you sayith the Lord so God promises
[29:50] if you put everything into Christianity
[29:53] you'll find him Hallelujah he ain't
[29:55] going to hide from you right he a ain't
[29:58] going to go to sleep on
[29:59] you he promises I'm right there and
[30:02] you'll know exactly what I'm going to do
[30:04] with you you know exactly where you're
[30:05] going you know exactly uh that heaven is
[30:08] your future home Hallelujah glory to God
[30:12] Amen and if he did that for Jews how
[30:14] much more for the bride under the blood
[30:16] of Jesus Christ Hallelujah who is
[30:18] actually his bride now here's the one I
[30:21] want to bring up I forgot this is what I
[30:22] went looking for uh Psalm 130
[30:26] verse3 four five these are all good this
[30:31] is a short
[30:33] chapter I like I like to do
[30:36] that it's like it's like eating a good
[30:38] supper
[30:39] here Psalm 130 verse3 if thou Lord sh
[30:44] Mark iniquities oh Lord who shall stand
[30:46] now remember iniquity is what you know
[30:47] you did wrong you uttered something you
[30:49] know it's wrong but listen Church you
[30:51] know we can't let the devil beat us up
[30:53] you said that then you said that there
[30:55] you've got to ask for forgiveness and
[30:57] trust that God forgives you Hallelujah
[30:59] because if God made a list of all
[31:01] Jesse's iniquities that he did wrong I
[31:03] wouldn't be able to stand neither would
[31:05] you that's why the blood washes it all
[31:07] way
[31:08] Hallelujah no one could stand none
[31:13] there's none righteous no not one I love
[31:16] that verse Romans 3:23 there's none
[31:18] righteous so we all need a savior we all
[31:21] need forgiven we all need Grace
[31:24] Hallelujah verse uh four but there is
[31:27] forgiveness foress with thee that thou
[31:29] mayest be feared so see if you utter
[31:32] something evil and you know God's
[31:35] forgiven you then that makes you fear
[31:37] God more you'll be slow to speak quick
[31:39] to
[31:40] listen if you got a mouth if you run
[31:42] your mouth like a motor and you got a
[31:44] machine gun mouth and that just you've
[31:46] always been like that you just run your
[31:47] mouth God will let you say such awful
[31:50] things but if you love him he'll forgive
[31:52] you and he'll teach you not to be a
[31:54] motor mouth
[31:55] anymore he'll teach you to be soft
[31:57] spoken
[31:59] it'll teach you to respect God and keep
[32:01] your mouth shut can I say it like that
[32:03] when you ought
[32:04] to coming off kind of harsh tonight
[32:08] Hallelujah but we need that
[32:10] lesson not to just utter things without
[32:12] thinking about it wait on the Lord let
[32:16] the Lord put a word in your tongue
[32:19] Glory verse five I will wait for the
[32:22] Lord my soul doth wait and in his word
[32:25] do I hope so see what are you hoping for
[32:27] for
[32:28] salvation what are you hoping for if I
[32:30] cross the line are you hoping the
[32:32] devil's right or you hoping Jesus is
[32:34] right you're hoping God's right hope in
[32:37] the word hallelujah we must put our
[32:40] hopes in the word I may not be preaching
[32:42] necessarily to everybody here tonight
[32:44] just because of the uh the kind of the
[32:45] response I've been getting but just
[32:47] trust that you got to Hope in the word
[32:49] don't hope in the mind battles don't
[32:50] hope for the worst hope for the best
[32:53] Hallelujah and Jesus has the best
[32:55] Hallelujah
[33:01] Glory now I just made this point earlier
[33:03] you have to strengthen your weaknesses
[33:05] right so if you utter something uh God
[33:08] will forgive you uh but then it teaches
[33:11] you to fear God and to prepare for the
[33:13] next
[33:14] battle that's what uh Chris had a good
[33:16] testimony he was watching this this
[33:17] older man and this older man was
[33:19] anointed he was powerful on the video
[33:22] and he was speaking things about
[33:23] trusting in God and repenting and
[33:24] getting right with God and Chris said it
[33:26] gave him a complete victory in that
[33:27] moment is that right

[36:11] soldier who's looking for Invaders you
[36:15] better be V Vigilant watching watching
[36:18] for the devil to try to slip into your
[36:19] life ready for him to come in be sober
[36:22] vilant because your adversary the devils
[36:24] like a roaring lion walking about
[36:26] sinking him he may devide so he's like a
[36:28] lion and now the next time he comes
[36:30] brother Chris he's going to be seven
[36:31] times bigger so picture a lion that you
[36:34] you fought off that line right through
[36:35] that video the de the Lord helped you
[36:37] fight off that devil but now that
[36:39] Devil's going to come back seven times
[36:40] bigger one double three four five and
[36:43] you got to be ready but you've got the
[36:45] most powerful weapon there ever was
[36:47] known in the whole universe you got the
[36:49] word of God the word of Jesus Christ
[36:52] Hallelujah all you got to say is Satan
[36:54] get behind me you're an offense to Jesus
[36:56] Christ my Lord
[37:01] Hallelujah Glory
[37:03] Hallelujah we got a good lesson this
[37:05] I've I shared to you before but in First
[37:07] Kings
[37:09] 20 uh Ahab got a victory over Ben haad
[37:14] but in First Kings
[37:15] 20:22 the prophet came and told him
[37:17] strengthen your position and see what
[37:19] must be done because next spring the
[37:21] king of amram will attack you again so
[37:23] Ahab got a word he's coming
[37:25] back Hallelujah so after his uh defeat
[37:29] Ben haad regrouped and prepared for the
[37:32] second attack now Ahab did some prepar
[37:35] now this is Ahab
[37:38] Ahab married to Jezebel the painted up
[37:41] face Jezebel even he could take some
[37:44] instruction if he could take instruction
[37:46] we should take full instruction
[37:49] Hallelujah to prepare ourselves we know
[37:51] the devil's coming back at the time of
[37:52] War which is the next season could be
[37:55] tomorrow
[37:57] he did he gathered his forces Ahab
[37:59] gathered his forces and fortified his
[38:01] position however he his strategy was
[38:04] less confident than it could have
[38:06] been uh the battle that ensued was a
[38:09] decisive one but God intervened on
[38:12] ahab's behalf giving Israel Victory once
[38:16] more so the victory really wasn't
[38:17] because of Ahab it was because of God
[38:19] protecting Israel Hallelujah that was
[38:22] the battle Simon preached on with uh the
[38:24] god of the hills and The Valleys they
[38:25] said oh God's not the god of the Hills
[38:28] God's and then God comes and says yes I
[38:30] am the god of the hills so he come to
[38:32] back up Israel for his name's sake
[38:35] sometimes God fights for his name's sake
[38:38] Hallelujah just to prove to the devil
[38:40] that he is God
[38:43] hallelujah well that's a good example
[38:45] there's two examples Ahab and the Lord
[38:47] Jesus said once you defeat the devil get
[38:50] stronger because the devil's going to
[38:52] come back seven times hotter it's going
[38:54] to be seven times more seductive or
[38:56] seven times more pleasurable but you got
[38:59] to be willing to fight and you got to
[39:01] fight by the word of
[39:03] God
[39:07] hallelujah now let me let's look I'm
[39:09] going to go some quotes here here the
[39:10] last few minutes here by God's grace I
[39:12] try to give you some good
[39:14] quotes brother ramam said in presuming
[39:16] 1962 down in their heart there's a
[39:18] desire and father Satan wouldn't put a
[39:21] desire in their heart to do
[39:24] right Satan would put a desire in their
[39:26] heart to do wrong Satan would say
[39:28] continue on uh don't go up Let it alone
[39:32] don't believe it that's what he would
[39:34] say so now you know who's talking to you
[39:37] when the holy spirit says come on up do
[39:39] something about it don't stay in that
[39:41] condition change your circumstance
[39:43] Hallelujah go to God pray that's the
[39:46] Holy Ghost working on you you haven't

[40:00] something in your heart for God and
[40:02] won't express it and so forth just keep
[40:04] putting it off well later on later on
[40:06] and that little desire that you once had
[40:08] to serve God will be taken from you the
[40:11] devil will come in and steal that away
[40:12] and then you won't have any desire to
[40:14] serve him so if you have the least
[40:17] desire he says there must be something
[40:20] that even brought you to this breakfast
[40:22] this morning there is something faith
[40:24] comes by hearing hearing of that word
[40:28] amen and there must be some desire or
[40:30] you wouldn't even have been here now
[40:33] don't let that desire Trinkle off into
[40:35] some little I'll join a church I'll

[41:02] a young lady she went back there and sat
[41:04] down a few moments ago and she thinks
[41:06] that she's crossed a separating line

[41:27] as long as you love God God still loves
[41:30] you it has to be a Creator to create
[41:33] that Creation in your heart to make you
[41:35] love God why do you why do you feel that
[41:38] Love in Your Heart A Creator created

[41:41] there why do you love God why do you
[41:43] think about so much why do you think

[43:20] 1955 brother man's praying father will
[43:23] you bring that poor wandering back
[43:25] slider back no wonder if he's setting
[43:27] out lied and condemned feels maybe he's
[43:31] crossed a separat line no he hasn't your
[43:34] spirit's still calling as long as it
[43:36] calls you're wanting your wondering
[43:38] child to come
[43:39] home won't you grant it tonight father
[43:42] that the Holy Spirit bring conviction to
[43:44] the audience and bring many wandering
[43:45] children to
[43:47] thee Oh Glory to God Amen
[43:52] now here's a couple brother Ram says
[43:54] here's when you know you've crossed the
[43:55] line brother R said he met a woman in a
[43:57] uh a meeting one time and brother said
[44:00] young lady I believe God's calling you
[44:02] tonight sister she said if I want
[44:04] somebody to talk to me i' want somebody
[44:06] that's got more sense than
[44:08] you brother B said well sister I can
[44:10] only say what the holy spirit's telling
[44:12] me she said I don't want to hear no that
[44:14] no more a year later I passed through
[44:17] the city and the girl become a
[44:18] prostitute her clothes hanging low on
[44:20] her offered me a drink of whiskey I
[44:22] shamed her and she said you know what
[44:24] preacher you remember the night you told
[44:25] me I ought to be saved I said said yes I
[44:27] do she said that was the truth I've
[44:29] crossed the separating line there I've
[44:31] grieved God from my heart like the last
[44:33] time she said I could see my mother's
[44:36] Soul fry in hell like a pancake and
[44:39] laugh at it so see this is when someone
[44:42] has cross the line no more care for God
[44:46] no more care for even their
[44:48] mother see Church see we're not like
[44:51] that we love our moms amen we love our
[44:54] we love our siblings we would never want
[44:55] to see anybody go to hell except the
[44:57] devil and all his Fallen Angels
[44:59] Hallelujah we want to see anybody to go
[45:02] to hell but that's how she knew she'd
[45:05] crossed the line no more desire to get
[45:08] right with
[45:09] god brother said your cons this is a new
[45:12] quote different quote your conscious uh
[45:14] this I didn't put the didn't put the
[45:16] sermon down that's strange I must forgot
[45:18] your conscious even tells you that's the
[45:20] truth unless you've crossed the
[45:22] separating line you cross the separating
[45:24] then you've got to be given over to the
[45:25] mind of the devil delusion to believe a
[45:28] lie and be damned by it thinking you're
[45:31] right so here's someone else that's
[45:33] crossed the line they believe a lie they
[45:35] think they're right and they're they're
[45:38] they're under a delusion and they won't
[45:40] accept anything in the word of God right
[45:43] that reminds us of Romans chapter 1
[45:47] okay oh yeah here's another one a third
[45:49] one the mark of the beast
[45:51] 1956 he said brother have you sinned so
[45:54] far and cross the separating line till
[45:55] you think that's foolish
[45:57] don't you think it's or do you think
[45:59] it's not the word of God have you gotten
[46:01] that condition or have you still got a
[46:03] little tinkling in there the door isn't
[46:05] all the way
[46:08] closed so see brother says a reprobate
[46:11] mind says the Bible's foolish they'll
[46:13] say it's foolish I don't care who burns
[46:15] in hell that that's a reprobate mind you
[46:17] wouldn't say that because you're saved
[46:21] Hallelujah brother bam said yes say you
[46:23] say yes brother I believe it's a truth
[46:25] and this morning I accept it and from
[46:27] this day henceforth I mean by the grace
[46:29] of God to make my life different
[46:32] Hallelujah see a child of God says Lord
[46:34] let your spirit make my life different
[46:36] when I leave this church amen make me
[46:38] more like you make me a better Christian
[46:41] I accept the promises of
[46:43] God but ra said I now raise my hands to
[46:46] Jesus Christ and ask him to be merciful
[46:48] to me and let the flow of his life come
[46:50] into me and make me a newborn baby in
[46:53] the kingdom of God so my life will be
[46:55] like his life amen he says will you do
[46:59] it tonight and raise your hands to
[47:00] Christ God Bless you that's as simple as
[47:02] as it is do you want Jesus Christ to
[47:04] fill your life do you accept his life
[47:06] that's all you got to do to get right
[47:07] with God
[47:11] Amen all right this is a little longer
[47:13] one but I'm going to skip to the main
[47:14] parts of it well here let me read this
[47:17] one first brother Raam said Judas only
[47:19] played church at the end he wasn't
[47:22] sincere he would have never betray
[47:24] betrayed Jesus he sowed that se of
[47:27] discrepancy he thought he could make
[47:29] friends with the world Mammon and also
[47:31] have friendship with Jesus that's what
[47:34] he did I I think I can go be friends
[47:36] with the Pharisees and I can also be
[47:38] friends with Jesus and I can take their
[47:39] money to betray Jesus no you can't do
[47:42] that you can't betray the word and then
[47:45] think the word's going to save you so
[47:47] look that's the attitude of someone
[47:48] who's crossed the line I can betray the
[47:52] word and then the word will still well
[47:54] well he didn't care but that that's what
[47:56] he would have thought before him hand
[47:57] well the word will still forgive me and
[47:58] I can still make money by betraying the
[48:00] word I can play for both teams no you
[48:03] can't I can love both people no you
[48:06] can't you only love one or the other
[48:08] Jesus says brother
[48:14] Chris
[48:23] yeah it was set in stone because it was
[48:25] God's predestination
[48:27] right because uh for us we don't know
[48:29] who's predestinated but in God's eyes uh
[48:32] Paul said God has he it's like in heaven
[48:34] it's almost like now he didn't do this
[48:35] but it's like he made Vessels to honor
[48:37] and vessels to dishonor so Judas in
[48:39] God's plan was always a Dishonored
[48:42] vessel he was always going to be lost
[48:43] just like Pharaoh Esau uh balum Cain
[48:48] they were always going to be lost but
[48:50] God was pleading with them God was
[48:51] pleading with them not to do it Jesus
[48:53] even called him friend right
[48:57] so they they plead with him and then
[48:58] Judas heard him preach for three and a
[49:00] half years you know he saw he saw all
[49:02] those
[49:03] Miracles and that was God's mercy to him
[49:06] so see that that's the mind of a rep
[49:08] probate well I can make money by
[49:09] betraying the word and I can leave the
[49:11] word and I'll I'll still go to heaven no
[49:13] you
[49:15] won't now here's a good one I think you
[49:17] like this
[49:18] one 1958 contending for the faith now a
[49:22] woman comes into his presence he said
[49:23] don't be shook up because you feel a
[49:25] little strange feeling but it's a glor
[49:26] glorious
[49:28] feeling he said that's not me that's him
[49:30] that's that's not me it's your lord he
[49:33] said be reverent
[49:35] please he said you've had real funny
[49:37] feelings goes through you all the time
[49:39] and especially real late of a evening
[49:41] anybody bad a late evening
[49:44] stuff isn't that right I see you you're
[49:47] sitting down in a chair kind of late in
[49:49] the evening you get tired you can't do
[49:52] work okay so this is an evil spirit
[49:54] coming on her at night time she can't
[49:57] work isn't that right causes even a
[50:00] stomach condition in you so you can't
[50:02] work it's at night and your stomach
[50:04] hurts every night like acids and things
[50:07] when you drink coffee oh I like
[50:10] that and something another on that like
[50:13] you belch up acids out of your stomach
[50:15] so stomach pain at night time that's
[50:17] right I see you moving away from the
[50:19] table where there's stuff like that on
[50:21] by the window near window is that true
[50:22] raise your hand if that's true now
[50:24] something here knows your life I told
[50:26] you how the Bible that Jesus Christ did
[50:27] the same thing did he not right he
[50:30] discerned the woman at the well
[50:32] uh Andrew and Peter nuh Nathaniel he
[50:37] discerned
[50:39] them he said I see a real dark shadow
[50:42] following you too which is the devil and
[50:44] he's almost tempted you to
[50:47] Suicide sometime telling you you'd cross
[50:51] a separating line and that you wasn't
[50:53] never going to be saved is that right
[50:55] now raise your hand she ra raises her
[50:57] hand so see all the stomach pain the
[51:00] night time no energy uh C uh coughing
[51:03] things up spinning things up all this
[51:05] had caused her to feel like she should
[51:07] just commit suicide the devil's saying
[51:09] you've already crossed the line why
[51:11] would this be
[51:13] happening now he says but now sister if
[51:16] I can by the grace of God make it leave
[51:18] you now will you believe
[51:22] him brother BR said now you probably

[54:35] in that recognition in that Vindication
[54:38] that God is there the person can see the
[54:40] mercy of God the love of God because I
[54:43] didn't know that man from Adam I didn't
[54:44] know that guy from Adam I don't know
[54:46] what they're going through I just preach
[54:47] what the Holy Spirit put on my heart
[54:49] when I couldn't sleep the previous day I
[54:51] tried to take a nap and I couldn't take
[54:52] a nap God said you're not taking a nap
[54:54] you need to write down these sermon
[54:55] notes so I spent my nap time when I went
[54:57] to nap writing down the sermon notes but
[54:59] it was God writing down that man's life
[55:01] and we preach his life by the spirit of
[55:03] God and the man was set free Hallelujah
[55:06] and the next Wednesday I saw him on the
[55:07] live stream he's up there clapping
[55:09] looking around say is this wonderful
[55:11] he's clapping and praising the Lord
[55:14] hallelujah I'm trying to close here it's
[55:16] 8
[55:20] o'clock all right let me uh just do a
[55:23] couple
[55:24] more now Church we always well I'm sorry
[55:29] now we always think about the side of
[55:31] when people go over into reprobate right
[55:36] we always think about the side of you
[55:37] know Judas and Cain and but so sometimes
[55:40] we forget to look at the other
[55:45] side brother Bram said have faith in God
[55:47] believe him with all your heart with all
[55:49] your soul with all your mind with all
[55:50] your strength have faith in God if thou
[55:52] C believe all things are possible see
[55:54] Church there's times God is going to
[55:56] challenge your faith to believe you've
[55:58] got to believe right that's what Jesus
[56:00] did many times he said if you can
[56:01] believe all things are possible but
[56:03] other times like in John 5 Jesus did the
[56:05] miracle and the man didn't even ask for
[56:07] a miracle let's let's pull it up John
[56:09] five so see you got to recognize when is
[56:11] the spirit of God challenging you and if
[56:13] he's challenging you accept it but it's
[56:16] got to be really God not just the
[56:18] preacher you understand sometimes
[56:19] preachers will say things they're just
[56:21] doing their best but it might not be for
[56:23] you but you got to know when is God
[56:25] speaking to my heart how you know he'll
[56:26] tell you the secrets of your heart
[56:29] that's how you'll know let's go to John
[56:30] 5 just so you know this man never asked
[56:33] Jesus to be healed this man uh uh Jesus
[56:37] doesn't say oh you don't got enough
[56:38] Faith he Jesus just does the
[56:45] miracle verse six when Jesus saw him lie
[56:48] and knew that he had been now a long
[56:49] time in that case he said to him wil
[56:51] thou be made whole impotent man answered
[56:54] him now look he don't even say yes or no
[56:55] he don't even say say
[56:57] yes he just says sir he don't even call
[56:59] him Lord he just says sir he he didn't
[57:02] have the Revelation he was Lord or son
[57:03] of David or son of man or anything he
[57:05] just said
[57:07] sir this proves God can do whatever he
[57:09] wants when he wants no doubt God knew he
[57:12] wanted to be healed but he didn't ask
[57:14] for the healing right
[57:15] here he doesn't call him son of David
[57:17] Son of God he doesn't say he don't call
[57:19] him Lord he just says
[57:21] serve I have no man when the water is
[57:23] troubled to put me in the pool he just
[57:25] talks about his problem problem s he
[57:27] just gives God the reasons why he can't
[57:29] get healed and that's enough for God Oh
[57:32] Glory hallelujah amen when God wants to
[57:35] do something God's GNA do it Hallelujah
[57:38] you can't stop him and sometimes you
[57:39] don't have to ask him he'll just do
[57:41] something to bless you
[57:42] Hallelujah that's my God that's how good
[57:45] God is
[57:48] hallelujah for when I'm while I'm coming
[57:50] another one Ste down before me so he
[57:52] just gives him two excuses why he can't
[57:54] get well and Jesus said well I'm greater
[57:56] than your
[57:57] excuses I'm the way maker when you don't
[58:00] have a way I'll make a way for
[58:03] you verse eight Jesus said to him rise
[58:06] take up thy bed and walk and immediately
[58:07] the man was made whole and took up his
[58:09] bed and walked on the same day was the
[58:10] Sabbath anybody ever see him asked for
[58:12] healing in this whole
[58:15] conversation he never even asked for it
[58:18] God Jesus knows he wants to be healed
[58:20] but he don't even ask for it Jesus just
[58:23] does it so see there but then there's
[58:24] other times he said if you can believe
[58:26] believe all things are possible to them
[58:27] but you got to believe so there's times
[58:30] he's going to challenge your faith and
[58:31] you got to raise your faith there other
[58:33] times he's just going to do it because
[58:34] you're
[58:36] faithful

[1:02:41] right killed him Ser served him as food
[1:02:45] he sold out
[1:02:47] everything brother BR said now that's
[1:02:50] that shows you how a prophet should do
[1:02:51] it he burnt every bridge as we call it
[1:02:54] he killed the ax took the yolks and the
[1:02:57] plow and made a sacrifice to the Lord
[1:02:58] showing that all of his Earthly doings
[1:03:00] were
[1:03:02] over he was completely sold out to the
[1:03:06] Lord that's why you know when ha got the
[1:03:08] Holy Ghost she said that week she threw
[1:03:10] all the pants out of her
[1:03:12] closet
[1:03:14] Hallelujah remember brother Aman told
[1:03:16] that story you think he got the TV three
[1:03:18] he got the TV and the video games three
[1:03:19] separate times but each time the Holy
[1:03:20] Spirit told him to get rid of
[1:03:22] it yep he didn't get the Holy Ghost till
[1:03:25] got rid of it the last time there's got
[1:03:27] to be a last time amen oh thank God Amen
[1:03:31] if we can get to the last time I'm
[1:03:33] struggling with that I'm cutting that
[1:03:34] off for the last time I'll never go back
[1:03:37] to that you'll cross over into this land
[1:03:40] of Faith
[1:03:42] Hallelujah that's right
[1:03:46] Church oh he's completely sold out to
[1:03:49] the Lord that's the kind way every man
[1:03:51] and woman that comes to Christ ought to
[1:03:53] completely sell out and get rid of sin
[1:03:56] and put everything behind them cross the
[1:03:58] separating line and look only to God
[1:04:00] from them on what a difference it would
[1:04:03] be in every man and woman if they would
[1:04:05] do that am so there's another way one
[1:04:08] way is just make make love to Jesus kiss
[1:04:11] his feet love him and you'll fly off and
[1:04:13] cross the line into Faith another way is
[1:04:15] to sell out everything and give Jesus
[1:04:18] everything I'm deleting every every
[1:04:21] contact that's not a good
[1:04:23] contact right I'm getting rid of every
[1:04:25] immoral thing in my life I'm getting rid
[1:04:27] of I'm confessing my sin to everyone I
[1:04:28] know I've sinned against I'm I'm selling
[1:04:30] out I'm burning every bridge if they
[1:04:32] don't want to be my friend they don't
[1:04:33] have to be my friend as long as Jesus Is
[1:04:35] My
[1:04:37] Friend then you'll fly off and cross
[1:04:40] over into
[1:04:42] Faith
[1:04:46] Hallelujah last
[1:04:48] one last
[1:04:51] quote looking at the Unseen 1958
[1:04:56] if there ever was a time the church need
[1:04:58] to step across the line which separates
[1:04:59] you between faith and unbelief by sight
[1:05:02] and looking at the Unseen by faith it's
[1:05:05] now of course that's when you leave
[1:05:07] everything behind every care what are
[1:05:09] you caring about tonight Church what's
[1:05:11] caring that takes you away from the Lord
[1:05:13] every weary what wearies you tonight
[1:05:15] that you don't have enough faith
[1:05:17] for everything that says you can't be a
[1:05:22] Christian i've smoked too long I smoke
[1:05:26] I've drank too long I drank alcohol

[1:05:45] tell the devil say I can do it for Jesus
[1:05:49] said whosoever will let him come and
[1:05:52] drink from the Waters of the Fountain of
[1:05:54] Life freely leave that sin behind let's
[1:05:58] stand to our feet musicians you can

[1:06:06] here to forgive you God's here to
[1:06:08] strengthen you God wants you to be so
[1:06:10] far crossing the line on the side of

[1:06:16] side are you going to struggle yes
