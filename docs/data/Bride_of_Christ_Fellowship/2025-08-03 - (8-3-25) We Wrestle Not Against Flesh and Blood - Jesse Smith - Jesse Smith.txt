TRANSCRIPT
========================================
be in the nurse's hands. We could be in all kinds of different hands. But thank God we're in the hands of Jesus Christ today. Hallelujah. Thank God for his mercy and his grace. Hallelujah. Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10. I'll read uh 10 and 11 in of the Lord Jesus Christ. Finally, my brethren, be say you might want to like Adam said last night. He didn't say you might want to try to be strong. He didn't say try. He said be strong. As our brother said last night, it's a command from God. &gt;&gt; So, not just men. Now, now this is speaking to men and women, right? But last night, Joshua, we're looking at men. But of course, our men, we want all our men to be strong. Be strong in the Lord, in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Let's read uh 13 together. One, two, three. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand. Amen. Let's have one more word of prayer. If you have a need on your heart, let's make it known unto God. You can lift your hand or lift your heart to God. Father God, you see the hands today, my hands up. Lord, each heart, no doubt, Lord, that's in right condition wants something from you today, Lord God. And we just worship you today. We thank you for the hands of Jesus, Lord. You reached out your hand, Lord, and took us out of the miry clay, Lord God. Saved us by your grace. Hallelujah. We're in your predestinated plan, Lord God. And we're so grateful for that. Hallelujah. Lord, the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord. You've ordained this service, Lord, this weekend. We're so thankful for you bringing your servant, Brother Adam, here and for this testimony time. And Lord, I know it had a great impact last night, Lord God. And just bless him again today. Lord, as we look to your word, we just lay the foundation for the testimony that's coming, Lord God. I pray you'd bless each and every one, Lord God. Speak to the young. Speak to the adults, Lord God. We'll be very thankful when we leave this place. Hallelujah, with the mighty hands of Jesus in control of our lives, God. We give you glory, God. And we ask that your Holy Ghost would have preeminence in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you're taking your seats here. Not going to forget. I'm going to set a timer here by God's grace. Hallelujah. So, I'm just going to kind of preach a little thought called we wrestle not against flesh and blood just for about 30 minutes here and sometimes I got to take it over a little five minutes extra. So, we'll see how uh it goes today. But we're really excited for the testimony today. I told brother Adam, you know, probably have a few more young people here today, a few more sisters here today. And so, we'll see how the Holy Spirit, you know, directs his testimony today. Hallelujah. Now, we do have a recording from last night if the uh sisters, you know, the adult sisters would like to listen to it. I I don't think the the children should listen to it, you know, because it was more directed towards men. But if the adult sisters, you know, are interested in that, you're more than welcome. I I'm going to try to get up on YouTube today in a private setting and then just share the link. Of course, I share it with all
