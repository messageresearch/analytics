[7:56] good here
[7:58] love to hear the the seeing the worship
[8:02] ing Soldier
[8:04] amen there's a warrior right there that
[8:06] testimony told me years ago still sticks
[8:08] with me and helps me push through almost
[8:10] every
[8:12] everything that looks almost like it's
[8:14] insane or a very dangerous situation or
[8:17] whatever like got me through many
[8:18] battles right there that testimony so I
[8:20] really always push out I'll never forget
[8:22] that brother just how
[8:24] it's not real
[8:26] amen so that one's the some of those
[8:29] some of them testimonies you know you
[8:31] forget here there but some of them you
[8:32] just never forget because they're just
[8:35] and God allows someone to go through
[8:37] something like that so he can testify
[8:39] because sometime in our lives we're
[8:42] going to need
[8:44] to have to hear someone else have
[8:46] already went through it and God can get
[8:48] him through it then he where he's going
[8:50] to get us through as well so amen so
[8:52] we're very grateful for those things I
[8:53] don't know if you know brother Ray there
[8:55] he he was working in uh one of the
[8:58] factories there and like a 900 pound bar
[9:00] fell on his hand or flipped onto his
[9:02] hand smashed it
[9:04] and he kept on working and just kept
[9:06] telling us work co-workers he said this
[9:08] isn't real and God healed it more
[9:10] actually he was smushed blood coming out
[9:12] and everything and God
[9:14] delivered the whole thing still works
[9:16] right there
[9:24] amen there it is he's so everything all
[9:27] things are possible to those that
[9:28] believe amen that's just spoken word
[9:31] absolutely so there you go
[9:33] amen we're go I thought about doing a
[9:36] PowerPoint we're just going to teach a
[9:37] little bit here let's turn to Psalms
[9:39] 104.
[9:41] that's a study I recently taught at home
[9:44] just
[9:45] um
[9:48] you know every
[9:49] every Bible study you know that I have
[9:52] ever taught or every little study I've
[9:55] taught that God had to show it to me and
[9:58] just bring something as Pastor Jesse
[9:59] knows and others who teach or preach or
[10:02] Whoever Whenever God gives you a thought
[10:04] that's for you
[10:05] and when he gives you that thought only
[10:08] you can see it clearest they'll say like
[10:11] that when when he gives you that thought
[10:14] that is for you specifically it's a
[10:16] personal revelation to you and then as
[10:19] as a minister or just like a testimony
[10:21] however when you try and speak and bring
[10:23] it out now it's it's for others to try
[10:26] and catch it and if you can yield
[10:27] yourself to the holy ghost that same
[10:29] Revelation understand that you caught
[10:30] the God will give to others so that's uh
[10:33] that's something that we want to uh
[10:36] maybe try and convey by God's grace this
[10:38] morning or this afternoon this evening
[10:39] so
[10:41] if we could let's turn to uh like I said
[10:44] there
[10:47] Psalms 104
[10:49] and let me get there myself here
[10:52] I just thank the Lord Jesus Christ has
[10:54] been so good and faithful and working
[10:56] with the Young Apprentice now he's a
[10:58] first year and
[10:59] still learning a lot and but but when
[11:02] it's just me and him you know we get a
[11:03] lot I get a lot of witness and time in
[11:04] so just little things just pinpointing
[11:07] this and pinpoint and then you know as
[11:10] you get older you see and you see the
[11:11] younger generation and they think they
[11:13] know so much and this and this and you
[11:15] say hey well have you ever thought about
[11:16] this and then and all of a sudden the
[11:18] quietness comes and they're like you see
[11:20] all the wheels turning and you want to
[11:23] you want to try and get them to think
[11:25] for themselves really think about it
[11:28] think about the world we live in think
[11:30] about this and think about that and uh
[11:32] and then of course as Christians we want
[11:33] to say hey think about the Bible think
[11:35] about what God has done think about
[11:37] things the science can't even touch or
[11:39] even explain or even grasp they still
[11:42] don't even know I was like this
[11:43] electricians they still don't know
[11:45] electricity is they really don't know
[11:47] what it is some kind of power that
[11:48] you're able to harness I mean what is it
[11:50] they just really don't know so they even
[11:52] teach that in their electrical schools
[11:54] there so anyhow let's get to Psalms 104
[11:57] we'll start at verse 1.
[11:59] and we're going to read through 1
[12:02] through 13 there
[12:05] bless the Lord O My Soul o bless my God
[12:08] he says Thou Art very great and thou art
[12:10] clothed with honor and Majesty he says
[12:13] who cover thyself with light as with the
[12:16] Garment who stretches out the heavens
[12:17] like a curtain who lay at the beams of
[12:20] his Chambers and the waters who maketh
[12:22] the clouds his Chariot who walk upon the
[12:25] wings of the Winds
[12:27] who may get this Angel's Spirits his
[12:30] ministers a flaming fire who laid the
[12:33] foundations of the earth that it should
[12:36] not be removed forever who covers it
[12:39] with the deep as with the Garment now
[12:42] notice how that is he made the world and
[12:43] then he just
[12:45] overflowed it with water
[12:48] the water stood above the mountains see
[12:52] so the mountains were already there
[12:55] oh he says anti-rebuke they fled at the
[12:58] voice of thy Thunder they hastened away
[13:02] they go up by the mountains they shall
[13:05] go down by The Valleys unto the place
[13:07] which thou has founded for them thou has
[13:09] set up a bound that they may not pass
[13:12] over that they may not turn again to
[13:15] cover the Earth who sendeth the Springs
[13:17] Into The Valleys which run among the
[13:20] hills they give drink to every beast of
[13:22] the field in the wild the wild asses
[13:24] quench their thirst he says by them
[13:26] shall the fowls of the heaven have their
[13:28] habitation which sing among the branches
[13:31] he watereth the hills from his Chambers
[13:34] the Earth is satisfied with the fruit of
[13:36] thy works
[13:37] uh he says he causes the grass to grow
[13:39] for the cattle and the herb for the
[13:42] service of man that he may bring forth
[13:44] fruit out of the earth so let's say a
[13:47] word of Prayer

[14:51] little bit ago Lord and we'll just feel
[14:53] like reiterating oh we love you bless
[14:55] the people named Jesus Christ amen amen
[14:57] you may have your seats there were
[14:59] um
[15:03] we had prayer back here with brother
[15:05] Jesse and then
[15:06] Amen brother Malachi and sister Lydia
[15:09] and
[15:10] I see brother Malachi and sister Lydia
[15:13] walk in and
[15:15] um it was the last time I was here
[15:17] uh the youth there went to that youth
[15:19] meeting Acacia was
[15:22] one of them as well and they all it was
[15:24] was it five of you six of you guys
[15:26] and they walked in and they just stood
[15:27] in a row I'm sitting on a chair they
[15:29] just stood at a row and I'm looking at
[15:31] how they've grown and how they've aged
[15:34] and they're like talking to me but I'm
[15:35] just not hearing anything I'm just
[15:37] looking at them and I'm like
[15:40] they're growing up they're getting old
[15:42] they're where I was 20 plus years ago
[15:46] and it reminded me all the way back to
[15:49] and I thought you know what I thought
[15:50] about was
[15:52] um
[15:54] generation number one
[15:57] our grandpa Garza
[15:59] God dealt with him from an alcoholic to
[16:01] a heathen and then made him a Christian
[16:04] and then that same uh Christian move was
[16:08] on my our mother and then now it's moved
[16:10] to us and now we're on the fourth
[16:12] generation here the fourth generation
[16:14] I wonder if we'll move right into the
[16:15] old promised land and just take over
[16:17] here and
[16:22] young ones you've got battles ahead
[16:26] but you still got our calebs and our
[16:28] Joshua's here
[16:30] you still got some that are willing to
[16:31] fight with you and keep you uh uh you
[16:34] know we're trying to we're going to
[16:36] leave you alone we're right here with
[16:38] you so
[16:39] uh you've got a lot the unknown coming
[16:41] we have the unknown coming but we're
[16:43] together
[16:44] and we are uh just trying we're just
[16:46] trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ we
[16:48] know he he said he would restore
[16:50] back to the book of Acts
[16:53] there's a move coming there's something
[16:55] coming that's going to what turn this
[16:57] world upside down one more time God is
[16:59] going to he's not going to leave this
[17:01] world without a witness amen so in this
[17:04] little study here I uh I want to teach
[17:07] on and maybe like I think I call it
[17:08] Hills and Valleys and uh
[17:11] to me you know God has been so good and
[17:14] uh and as I read this scripture I
[17:17] thought about how he's this is dealing
[17:20] literally with Genesis 1 and in Genesis
[17:22] 1 we know that God in the Bible said in
[17:24] the beginning God created the heavens
[17:25] and he created the Earth and then now
[17:27] notice he created the earth now notice
[17:28] and like I says right here he said he
[17:31] had the Earth already formed then he
[17:33] calls the waters to go over the
[17:35] mountains and it's almost like that
[17:37] water like almost hid the very plan of
[17:39] God all all the the devil could see
[17:42] maybe at that time was just this thing
[17:44] and then all of a sudden it was covered
[17:45] with with water and now he just saw this
[17:47] planet was just with just covered with
[17:49] with water and that's it and that's all
[17:50] he saw but under hidden underneath that
[17:52] water was he said what was it was the
[17:55] mountains was hidden under that water
[17:57] and The Valleys were hidden underwater
[17:59] and what the prophet of God said he says
[18:01] all the seeds that could ever be born
[18:02] were already they're already planned
[18:04] we're already planted in the Earth right
[18:06] there but remember as as God then come
[18:09] down and the Bible says let there be
[18:10] light and all those sort of things he
[18:12] come down and he hovered and brooded
[18:14] upon the Earth and then he started he
[18:17] started so he said speaking to the to
[18:19] the waters he says you got to move over
[18:20] here you got to move over here he says
[18:22] and the Bible said that he spoke and he
[18:24] said right here this is as far as you
[18:25] water can go the oceans can go only this
[18:28] far this River has to go down this place
[18:30] path right here and then he set up the
[18:32] whole thing right there so in others
[18:34] it's predestined if the if the Earth is
[18:38] a type of you because remember the Earth
[18:40] had to what he had it what the Earth had
[18:42] to what hear the gospel then it had to
[18:44] what get baptized then I had to receive
[18:46] the blood of Jesus on the earth amen for
[18:48] sanctification then what we know the
[18:50] fiery baptism is coming right here at
[18:52] the End Amen so and then the Bible says
[18:54] what the Earth shall become new the
[18:56] heavens and earth shall wax old but
[18:57] they'll be brand new again what a
[18:59] complete perfect type one of the
[19:01] believer right absolutely justification
[19:03] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[19:05] what and Body Change amen absolutely
[19:07] it's exactly the same but everything was
[19:09] already predestinated right here for
[19:12] what for for what God's plan God's
[19:15] purpose Lord it was it was for his I'll
[19:17] say like this it was for his rich and it
[19:19] was revealing about his written word
[19:21] right there the Bible is right here in
[19:23] the Earth the Bible says you don't
[19:25] understand God God said don't understand
[19:27] things he says look at nature the nature
[19:29] will teach you amen the prophet of God I
[19:31] I just read a quote he says he says he
[19:33] says he goes people say there ain't no
[19:35] God and he says look at that Hill who
[19:38] made that Hill another thing I watched a
[19:41] couple uh little short videos there on
[19:43] their in their showing even greater
[19:45] things than even holin had found on
[19:47] creation and they're finding uh they're
[19:49] going up into these big uh uh they're
[19:52] taking the NASA
[19:53] shots of the earth there and they're
[19:55] showing of these giant mounds and Hills
[19:57] where it looks like what the water had
[19:59] brought in and formed all these just
[20:00] Rolling Hills and just like you go to a
[20:03] pond and you see these little Ripples
[20:04] and these little these little uh waves
[20:06] there and they cause these little
[20:07] ripples in the in the sand they're doing
[20:09] they've been they're sitting right there
[20:10] in the desert they're sitting right
[20:12] there on the edge of the Earth right
[20:13] there exactly the same just rope except
[20:15] they're huge Rolling Hills what great
[20:17] water there's a great flood already amen
[20:20] sure
[20:21] so as we as we get into this here I just
[20:23] want to teach on Hills and Valleys and
[20:24] and I was thinking all these things and
[20:27] I just found a uh maybe brother Jess has
[20:30] already taught on it but to me it was
[20:31] just uh phenomenal and and obviously one
[20:33] of the first things that comes to mind
[20:35] when dealing with Hills and Valleys is
[20:37] the first Samuel 17-1 and the Bible
[20:40] talks about how uh David was a chosen
[20:43] one of God he was anointed with what the
[20:45] Horn of oil and and all those sort of
[20:47] things and whatever and then what he
[20:48] heard that he his father sent him down
[20:50] to the camp there and there's what a
[20:51] great Philistine giant right and I
[20:53] remember I heard stories where brother
[20:55] Jesse would be in in the bedroom with
[20:57] the children and he'd be pretended to be
[20:58] Goliath and he let all the children slay
[21:00] him with the slaying with the the sling
[21:03] there and yes we go down as
[21:06] and they have a plan you guys remember
[21:07] that
[21:08] maybe I remember hearing about that but
[21:10] you know
[21:12] uh as as we see here you know the Bible
[21:14] and it brings forth and then David and
[21:17] the Bible says and now the Philistines
[21:19] gathered together their armies to battle
[21:21] and were gathered together at Socha he
[21:24] says which be long to Judah and Pitch
[21:26] between Socha and all these uh long
[21:28] names I can't pronounce them he says and
[21:30] the and Saul and the men of Israel were
[21:32] gathered together and they pitched by
[21:33] the valley of elah and set the battle
[21:35] away against the Philistines and the
[21:37] Philistines stood on the mountain on one
[21:39] side notice the Philistines were on the
[21:41] Mountaintop on one side he says and on
[21:43] the other side he says to the Israel he
[21:46] says and there was a valley in between
[21:48] them right so notice Goliath and is they
[21:51] were on their top of their Pinnacle of
[21:53] their uh military might and then here
[21:55] Israel was at the top of their military
[21:56] might both there was a showdown that had
[21:59] to take place amen and it was we know
[22:01] the scripture how the giant or the giant
[22:03] would go down Goliath would go out and
[22:05] he would challenge Israel 40 days in a
[22:07] row saying bring me out one man he says
[22:09] he says then we're going to fight he
[22:11] says in a I win he says you will serve
[22:13] us he says but if your man wins we will
[22:15] serve you now that we know the devil's a
[22:16] liar they were that was not going to
[22:18] happen if they were to be we saw it
[22:20] right there did when David got that
[22:22] slinging slim did they turn around say
[22:24] we're going to be they no they didn't
[22:25] they didn't have to have nothing to do
[22:27] with that it was awesome he was alive
[22:29] don't ever believe anything the devil
[22:31] tells you amen sure
[22:33] that's right so notice he says but
[22:35] notice that as as it looks here and and
[22:37] and David had to get now the David was
[22:40] sent here he heard about it then
[22:42] something had to Quicken right we know
[22:44] that something had to take place in the
[22:46] heart to elevate his faith
[22:49] to a place where he said he says he says
[22:52] that man he says how can he defy the
[22:53] Living God right and as as David had
[22:57] thought about these things and rehearsed
[22:58] these things in his mind he thought
[22:59] about anything he finally made his
[23:01] Proclamation he says he says I'll go
[23:03] find him right absolutely and we know
[23:06] the story how uh
[23:07] I'll say like this as we know the story
[23:09] David was trying to uh uh move on and
[23:12] and then he met with the King and as he
[23:15] met with the King he rehearsed to the
[23:18] king what he what had had taken place
[23:21] and the King's like how are you going to
[23:22] fight him you're just glad you're just a
[23:23] young man you're just a boy he would
[23:25] never be in a battle you never had any
[23:27] training but remember the Bible said
[23:29] what that he his testimony before the
[23:31] King was he says he says David said he
[23:34] says I have slain a bear and one that
[23:37] came and took one of my father's sheep
[23:38] he says I went and grabbed it he's and I
[23:40] slew it he says and also a lion he said
[23:44] the lion tried to come down and take one
[23:46] of my father's sheep what he says and I
[23:47] went out and slew it as well amen now he
[23:50] was a type of Christ right now notice
[23:52] the Bible said well he says he says Ah
[23:54] what Jesus say I'll not lose one amen
[23:56] and the Bible says what is the second
[23:58] Peter he says what the Satan would come
[24:00] as a lowering roaring lion what to come
[24:02] and get one of you but what the Holy
[24:05] Ghost is here tonight and has been for
[24:08] the what the last two thousand years and
[24:09] Beyond and forevermore he is going to
[24:12] save his very elected amen
[24:15] and that's just the truth absolutely so
[24:17] notice we see now we see the great
[24:19] battle come forth and David now had the
[24:21] the anointing on him he had the
[24:23] Revelation he understood that all things
[24:25] are possible what that thought came back
[24:27] to him what have I already what has God
[24:30] already done for me and through amen
[24:36] you know what they say about the
[24:37] testimony I heard a man say he says
[24:39] would you rather get take on a lion or a
[24:42] bear and the guy said I'd rather be
[24:43] taking on a lion
[24:44] and they said why is that he says he
[24:46] says the lion will come up and grab your
[24:48] neck he says and they'll choke you out
[24:49] and then eat you
[24:51] while a bear will grab you and just
[24:53] start eating right then
[24:55] [Laughter]
[24:58] yeah that's right
[24:59] so whoa and now now as David thought on
[25:02] these things he says he says who is this
[25:04] man who is this though he was tall
[25:06] though he's big no he's this and this
[25:07] I'll tell you what you sometimes you'll
[25:10] look at a man in the eye and you know
[25:11] you can look at the Man's eyes and know
[25:12] he's already defeated amen but I
[25:14] challenge you to look at a lion
[25:16] look go up to a zoo and look at that
[25:18] Lion's eyes eyes and eyes like this
[25:19] absolutely no fear try and find fear in
[25:22] the Lion's eyes try and find fear what
[25:24] in the Eagle's eyes amen these people
[25:25] don't these things don't show emotion
[25:28] maybe a dog maybe but these things are
[25:30] out in the wild that has what survived
[25:32] the hunt to live amen and to kill Shore
[25:34] absolutely no fear they have to move
[25:36] into a shore amen so
[25:39] now notice as as he went on these things
[25:42] what we know that David then came down
[25:44] to the brook into a to a little stream
[25:46] there and he grabbed five smooth stones
[25:48] and one for what each giant each brother
[25:51] each one everything you know he'd have
[25:53] many many battles before this but what
[25:55] he just needed that one
[25:58] and the Bible said that David hasten too
[26:02] to Goliath and what they had to meet
[26:04] down into the valley
[26:08] what's its type of it's a type of hell
[26:11] right
[26:12] where was where was The Showdown at The
[26:14] Showdown necessarily
[26:17] well here's David and here's Goliath
[26:19] where where who showed who was the King
[26:22] right then who I was like who was the
[26:25] King right there
[26:27] when Jesus descended down into hell oh
[26:30] my God he proved through the king who
[26:33] the Lord Of Glory was amen praise be to
[26:36] God Amen thank you to God yes and what
[26:40] he needed one Revelation I am God Amen I
[26:44] am Jesus the sinless one amen praise be
[26:47] to God that's exactly right yes sir hey
[26:52] Satan's already been defeated
[26:54] his forces are on the run so much so
[26:56] that if you just what speak the name of
[26:58] Jesus Christ amen sure I I wonder if
[27:01] after that defeat after the defeat of
[27:03] the giant I wonder if David at one of
[27:05] the Philistines would if someone just
[27:06] mentioned David that people would go
[27:07] like this in the Philistines say don't
[27:09] you say that name
[27:10] don't you say that name oh my and what
[27:13] we say in the name of Jesus Christ what
[27:15] every Devil's got to Humble every
[27:17] Devil's got to want run and flee even
[27:19] Satan himself if you resist him he shall
[27:21] flee from you amen
[27:23] absolutely praise be to God yes and the
[27:27] Bible says what there was no sword with
[27:29] David it's not by hands it's not by
[27:31] man's initiative what is by the spirit
[27:34] of God Amen absolutely and you've got to
[27:36] have what the sword of the spirit right
[27:38] here right before you what because
[27:40] remember if God created all things
[27:42] through what spoken word and you are a
[27:45] direct seed line of God all you have to
[27:48] do is mention just speak the word of God
[27:51] absolutely and watch what takes place
[27:53] amen
[27:55] it might not happen right away it might
[27:58] not this and this but I'm telling you
[27:59] what it will materialize
[28:02] we believe that amen because the Bible
[28:04] said so now
[28:06] I like what the prophet of God said
[28:07] hears and works is Faith expressed he
[28:09] says now notice he's when it's revealed
[28:11] David become Fearless
[28:14] so in every battle notice he was on the
[28:18] Mountaintop at that time is where you
[28:19] get his Revelation what's the Valentine
[28:22] when you get the Holy Ghost you get a
[28:23] refilling a refreshing of the Lord amen
[28:25] where he's like you realize you're bad
[28:27] all day maybe I'm maybe I'm a judicism
[28:28] or maybe I'm not a son of God or a
[28:30] daughter or God doesn't have it but once
[28:31] you get a refilling or a touch from the
[28:34] Lord you say oh my goodness I am just
[28:36] with I'm one with God Amen
[28:39] absolutely and then let's say a battle
[28:41] or whatever listen and you get that
[28:43] fresh revelation
[28:44] I've got this in my arm I've got this in
[28:46] my leg or something or a physical this
[28:48] or a physical that a disease or an
[28:50] infirmity what if you believe it what's
[28:52] that Revelation that you're healed
[28:53] strikes
[28:55] the battle's over
[28:57] it's over
[28:58] it's over
[29:00] that's exactly right now notice I like
[29:04] what he says in the next one here by
[29:05] God's grace
[29:07] he says in little David's standing here
[29:09] with a little piece of leather or goat
[29:11] skin or sheepskin two pieces of string
[29:12] tied together which was uh yep he says
[29:15] but it was revealed to him Revelation
[29:18] struck him amen see now notice this is
[29:20] this works for anybody
[29:22] Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[29:25] which is what revelation
[29:28] who like you said right here says he
[29:30] says amen he said God took that bear he
[29:33] says uh took me in the paws the bear and
[29:35] took me out of the Paw's line how much
[29:36] more he will he deliver me from that
[29:38] uncircumcised Philistine in my hand he
[29:41] said well what he had to wait for the
[29:43] Revelation and when it struck he said it
[29:45] was Fearless he says his brothers way
[29:48] more able to do it
[29:53] I'm not saying something nothing but
[29:54] just but if it's like at 3am and brother
[29:57] just he's sleeping and you need
[29:58] something from God you don't necessarily
[30:00] have to call him you have to call on the
[30:02] Lord
[30:03] absolutely
[30:07] now notice he says now of course when
[30:10] you get get the testimony you call
[30:11] Pastor Judson say Hey Brother Jess
[30:13] Pastor Jesse guess what and you know
[30:16] through the phone brother Jesse's going
[30:17] to be praising God and just worshiping
[30:19] God and dancing before the Lord amen
[30:22] just like this and like so he says sure
[30:24] he says he says but you see it was
[30:26] revealed to them he says there it is
[30:27] they believed it because now notice he
[30:29] said the Israel believed it could be
[30:31] done
[30:32] they had the testimony all the way from
[30:34] Abraham from Noah from Adam all that
[30:36] that was their leadership that was their
[30:38] testimony that was their Lifeline right
[30:40] there they know God was real they know
[30:42] they were called of God they know they
[30:43] came out of Egypt they had everything
[30:46] under the great prophet Moses right sure
[30:48] he says now they were believed to become
[30:50] we could be done they believed God could
[30:52] do it he says but it was not revealed to
[30:55] them
[30:56] he says but it was revealed to David now
[30:58] there's the difference right there if
[31:00] it's absolutely revealed to you that God
[31:02] is going to heal you he says you're
[31:04] going to get it he says you're going to
[31:06] get
[31:07] just like Brother Ray that thing lay on
[31:09] his hand I am sure the pain was maybe I
[31:12] don't know the pain but right then a
[31:14] revelation struck
[31:17] that's not real
[31:20] it wasn't real to anyone else but him
[31:24] sure he says you're going to get he says
[31:26] I don't care what's wrong with you
[31:27] what's the odds that may be worse than
[31:29] David and Goliath but if it's revealed
[31:31] to you
[31:32] see we always have to be open Lord what
[31:34] is your will in this situation what are
[31:36] you going to do right here and wait on
[31:39] him don't try to to go ahead of God's
[31:42] plan to go don't wait too far behind
[31:44] God's plan but make make sure we're all
[31:46] right walking in the correct steps at
[31:48] the right time with what has been
[31:50] revealed to you amen sure now
[31:53] uh
[31:55] one thing I love is David David's
[31:58] testimonies David's way of worship uh
[32:01] all everything about him he said the
[32:04] Bible said well he was a man after God's
[32:06] Own Heart
[32:08] just look at his songs
[32:09] [Laughter]
[32:14] everything's worship Judah means praise
[32:18] amen it's Psalms in Psalms 139 7 he says
[32:23] where there shall I go from thy Spirit
[32:25] how can I get away from you Lord he says
[32:27] wherever I go I feel amen praise be God
[32:29] when I'm down to the dumps I still feel
[32:31] you swooshed down and you lift me up he
[32:33] said well I'm the highest of heights I
[32:35] just jump higher I just worship the
[32:37] banner I praise God even the louder amen
[32:39] sure he says these are the Willows
[32:42] winner should I flee from thy presence
[32:43] he says if I Ascend into heaven Thou Art
[32:45] hair they're under there right there if
[32:47] I send one into the to the mountain top
[32:49] of the spiritual there we are he's a
[32:51] Divine make my bed and Hell behold Thou
[32:53] Art there as well amen
[32:55] there's your Mountain and Valley amen
[32:58] spiritually sure Realms yes
[33:04] now here's it here's something to think
[33:06] about here
[33:07] what's one of the most famous Psalms is
[33:09] 123.
[33:10] he says the psalm of David he says the
[33:12] Lord is my shepherd He says I shall not
[33:14] want he may giveth me to lie down in
[33:17] Green Pastures he leadeth me beside he
[33:19] leadeth me besides Still Waters oh why
[33:22] he says he restoreth my soul he says he
[33:26] leads me in the past of righteous for
[33:28] his name's sake sound like it's a great
[33:30] walk with the Lord sounds like he's what
[33:32] Right Back to Eden it sounds like he's
[33:34] waiting Fellowship in the cool of the
[33:36] evening oh my he's just right there just
[33:38] praise God he says oh everything's just
[33:39] glorious but not aware now notice he's
[33:41] leadeth me he leadeth me he leadeth me
[33:44] and though I walk
[33:46] through the valley of the shadow of
[33:49] death
[33:49] he said did I walk into
[33:52] he says I walk through
[33:54] [Laughter]
[33:57] did he wait so he's he's in sunshiny
[34:00] days and the birds are chirping uh the
[34:03] sun is out and then all of a sudden it
[34:05] gets dark out of nowhere
[34:10] walked through
[34:12] the darkness
[34:17] but notice he wasn't alone he says when
[34:19] I'm in heaven he's a Thou Art when I'm
[34:21] in hell they're out there he says he
[34:23] says for thou art with me thy rod and
[34:25] thy staff they comfort me amen and the
[34:27] prophet of God said well he says Rod was
[34:29] what the name of Jesus Christ amen you
[34:32] better have it because in that name liar
[34:35] salvation in that name uh healing
[34:39] absolutely what and he's right there in
[34:40] a present type of need amen so
[34:45] he says Thou prepares the table before
[34:47] me in the presence of my enemies he says
[34:49] that would have noise my head with oil
[34:50] he says my cup runeth hope or amen
[34:53] even in that Valley even in that shadow
[34:56] absolutely when the prophet of God said
[34:57] well he said that shadow
[35:00] how do you make a Shadow he said
[35:03] there has to be a light be Hind
[35:07] so there's the devil trying to make it
[35:09] this and this but remember beyond that
[35:10] Shadows of the Holy Ghost beyond that
[35:13] little Pillar of Fire amen the face of
[35:15] Christ amen sure absolutely right there
[35:18] he says don't worry he says he's you'll
[35:19] just be here passing before a moment
[35:21] here he said but after that he says
[35:22] it'll be right back it will fall right
[35:24] back in line him absolutely he said but
[35:26] what I'm going to lead you right through
[35:27] this to be tempted remember if Jesus had
[35:30] to go through the Temptation in the
[35:31] wilderness he's going to make you go
[35:33] through temptation as well amen
[35:37] shadow of death shadow of death 40 days
[35:41] in the desert as Christ had to do
[35:43] without fasting 40 days talk about a
[35:45] shadow of death
[35:48] walked right through it and lived and
[35:52] succeeded and went on to conquer the
[35:53] very one that was the shadow of death
[35:56] yeah now think about this
[35:59] shadow of death
[36:02] was the fourth seal
[36:06] who is the shadow who is the death you
[36:09] know and we're in his shadow
[36:10] he says that I had it and when he had
[36:12] opened the force you I heard the voice
[36:14] of the fourth Beast say come and see and
[36:16] I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his
[36:18] name that sat on him was death
[36:22] God is going to anoint the time
[36:24] Satan is going to himself
[36:28] shadow of death who is that horse rider
[36:30] it was revealed what in the first seal
[36:34] it was the Antichrist Spirit running and
[36:37] what is the shadow of death absolutely
[36:39] but notice we take these things on and
[36:41] notice this is right here at the end
[36:43] the fourth seal moves right into the
[36:44] tribulation
[36:46] shows what this last generation is going
[36:48] to move right through this thing
[36:53] see what you prepare for young ones
[36:57] Soldier
[36:59] future soldiers soldiers now
[37:05] we still have food right now we still
[37:06] have electricity still running water
[37:08] what about Ukraine where testimonies our
[37:10] brothers our sisters who believe the
[37:12] same message are eating what bark off
[37:13] the trees
[37:17] well we're the bride thinks of God the
[37:19] shadow of death may be coming the Bible
[37:21] prophesied
[37:23] for seal
[37:24] but remember
[37:26] he's God all ways
[37:30] amen
[37:32] praise be to God now
[37:35] I want to
[37:36] move into this
[37:38] another little Branch off this thought
[37:40] here
[37:43] you know I sometimes I teach a home and
[37:46] the cam gets up there and he'll just
[37:47] like Hammer the same thought like a
[37:49] thousand different angles and I'm just
[37:51] like
[37:52] it didn't even come to me
[37:55] but you know what I'm just I'm who I am
[37:56] I'm just limited to what God can give me
[37:59] amen like today I'll tell you it's on
[38:01] the job site I had all this whole
[38:03] in-ground Heating in in the foam and uh
[38:06] this and this and this and my project

[38:17] I just put the sensor in real quick
[38:18] anchored to the wall and we're good to
[38:20] go absolutely
[38:22] the Lord Lord allows those things to
[38:24] keep me humble
[38:25] when you think you're a pretty good
[38:27] plumber and then all of a sudden you're
[38:28] like ah man I need
[38:31] he knows how to Humble you right in
[38:34] front of the project manager
[38:36] I'm sure he gets his cars going yeah
[38:40] I'm about to stop in more often often ah
[38:43] in First Kings 20.
[38:47] something phenomenal happens here the
[38:49] Syrian King
[38:51] Ben Haddad
[38:52] goes out and tells King Ahab Ahab he
[38:55] says writes him a letter
[38:57] Ahab
[38:59] all your Silver's mine oh your gold's
[39:02] mine your wives your children
[39:04] it's all mine Ahab reads it like okay
[39:07] yeah sure all right you know whatever
[39:09] and then he writes the more serious one
[39:10] says no for real
[39:13] call the council we've got an issue here
[39:19] and what they have they have forms of uh
[39:22] the king of Syria Ben Haddad forms an
[39:24] army
[39:25] comes up to him
[39:27] God says I'm going to give them to you
[39:29] The Mao and the battle took place on the
[39:32] Mountaintop
[39:35] the Bible says God came down with the
[39:38] armies of Ahab and slew him and set them
[39:41] away and set them around the Bible said
[39:43] there's a great Slaughter
[39:45] the prophet God comes Ahab says hey
[39:48] get a victory he's about this time of
[39:49] next year he says round two
[39:52] he had prepares forces remember in this
[39:55] time of peace
[39:57] took out your Bible
[39:59] is anybody going next door to door and
[40:01] grabbing your Bible say you can't have a
[40:02] Bible
[40:04] in this time of Peace we prepare for the
[40:06] Lord and the prophet God said what he
[40:08] says prepare for scriptural War right
[40:14] and they're coming with another plan
[40:16] another scheme another this and that but
[40:18] remember the testimony of Ben Haddad
[40:20] depends he says he's he gathered his
[40:22] counsel and troops he said
[40:24] he said their God must be the god of the
[40:28] mountains
[40:31] but he is not a god of the battle
[40:33] [Laughter]
[40:35] but if he would have just went back in
[40:37] history and seen how David came down and
[40:39] flew the Philistines in the valley a
[40:42] giant
[40:43] but he must not heard about that one
[40:46] so the servant of the king of Syria says
[40:49] their gods are the gods of the hills he
[40:51] says but he says therefore they are
[40:52] stronger than we are he says but let us
[40:55] fight them in the plane for surely we
[40:57] shall be stronger than they
[41:00] and of course the Holy Ghost knows all
[41:03] things here's all things
[41:05] and a prophet of God who can hear what
[41:08] the King was whispering the king of
[41:09] Syria is Whispering over there and God
[41:11] revealed to him he came to the came to
[41:12] Ahab and said hey
[41:15] they said they they're saying God is not
[41:18] a god of The Valleys but only of the
[41:20] Hills
[41:21] and then the Holy Ghost hits the prophet
[41:23] and says thus saith the Lord he says he
[41:26] says for my sake
[41:29] he's dominant he goes he goes Ahab I he
[41:32] didn't certainly say this but you know
[41:33] what Abraham's heart you know who Ahab
[41:34] was a lukewarm baxton want to be a
[41:37] make-believer right he says Jesus for my
[41:39] name's sake he says I'm going to show
[41:40] them that I'm a God of God
[41:42] and if we came down to it we've seen
[41:44] later in the scripture here that they
[41:47] did go to war and the Bible says well he
[41:49] delivered a thousands times thousands of
[41:51] times thousands what a footman they were
[41:53] all slain
[41:54] the Bible said they ran them so much
[41:56] that 27 000 other foot soldiers went in
[41:59] the hood hid behind some kind of a wall
[42:03] and just like God Knocked Down the Walls
[42:06] of Jericho
[42:07] how many what kind of wall was this
[42:10] what kind of a what size kind of wall
[42:12] could God push over and kill 26 7 000
[42:14] people
[42:18] it's a big wall
[42:19] I wonder if it was built by Giants
[42:23] Justin we study that let me go
[42:27] amen so God pushed this giant wall over
[42:32] killed 27 000 of them and what God had
[42:35] the victory that day
[42:38] amen right
[42:40] right but where did Ben Haddad get that
[42:42] thought where did his counselors where
[42:45] did his wise men get the thought that oh
[42:47] he's the God Jesus or or Jehovah is the
[42:50] god of the hills but not of The Valleys
[42:51] where did he get that thought at
[42:57] because word gets round
[43:02] if you look at
[43:09] I want to read this here there's a quote
[43:11] from does God ever change his mind about
[43:13] his word
[43:15] and Israel of the Old Testament
[43:18] what we're reading about
[43:20] is a type of the Bride of the New
[43:22] Testament
[43:24] coming up out of the world marching on
[43:26] the road to Canaan he says that we go to
[43:30] the millennium right at all
[43:33] the entire New Old Testament that had to
[43:36] be lived out for our sakes
[43:38] everything they died in faith in is now
[43:41] ours
[43:42] the adoption now is what to the dot to
[43:44] the Jews to the Gentiles
[43:47] all the promises like we said before how
[43:49] many healing testimonies do you hear of
[43:51] the last 2000 years of the June
[43:53] raised from the dead Jews
[43:56] few and far in between if any for the
[44:00] most part them Jews were hunted down for
[44:02] two last two thousand years wherever
[44:03] they went they prospered and then the
[44:05] Judgment hit them
[44:07] it's history but in the Gentiles
[44:10] are people healing signs wonders and
[44:15] miracles so much so that it can't even
[44:17] not deny it
[44:18] all the way through history through even
[44:20] right now we have what testimonies
[44:22] where's brother bang at his your
[44:24] father-in-law your father right there
[44:25] was raised raised up from uh perishing
[44:28] what two three years ago right
[44:30] testimonies testimonies testimonies one
[44:33] after the other what because what
[44:35] everything passed it was the Jews were
[44:37] blinded to what we could receive it the
[44:39] Gentiles that was the great mystery what
[44:41] Christ in you performing his very will
[44:46] but remember the Old Testament was a
[44:48] type of the new
[44:50] so where did they get this idea
[44:53] where did those syrians get this idea
[44:55] that God is not a god of The Valleys
[44:57] only the hills only the mountains
[45:04] it's revealed here in
[45:06] I'll say like this we can start right
[45:08] here in the book of numbers 33
[45:11] first 50s sister Acacia if you want to
[45:13] bring that up
[45:16] he says in the Lord spake and the Moses
[45:18] and the plains of Moab by Jordan near
[45:20] Jericho saying Speak unto the children
[45:23] of Israel and saying to them when you
[45:24] are passed over Jordan into the canis
[45:27] land notice they're in they're moving
[45:29] towards that Holy Ghost Field Land right
[45:30] there a type of the Holy Ghost they
[45:32] promised land right
[45:34] he said then they shall drive out all
[45:36] the inhabitants of the land from before
[45:38] you drive them all out he says and
[45:40] destroy all their pictures destroy all
[45:42] their molten images and quite picked
[45:44] down all their high places pluck down
[45:47] he's and ye shall dispossess thee and
[45:49] the habits of the land and dwell therein
[45:50] if he says that's why I've given unto
[45:51] you the land to possess it
[45:54] let's thus say the Lord
[45:56] they have to do that
[45:59] that is their Commission
[46:02] General's orders yes sir right
[46:06] but notice verse 55 but if he will not
[46:09] drive out the inhabits of land before
[46:11] you then it shall come the past that
[46:13] those which you'll let remain of them
[46:15] shall be Pricks in your eyes and thorns
[46:17] in your signs and they shall Vex you in
[46:19] the land where you dwell in
[46:23] he says if you don't do it you're going
[46:25] to reap for this
[46:33] look at judges one
[46:35] Mr you can bring that up judges 1 verse
[46:37] 19.
[46:39] where did the king of Syria get this
[46:41] idea where'd they think about this
[46:45] because rumors go around the world
[46:48] and the Lord was with Judah and he drove
[46:50] out the inhabitants of the mountain but
[46:52] he could not drive out he said the
[46:55] inhabitants of Valley because they had
[46:56] Chariots of iron
[47:01] pretty much all
[47:04] of the tribes when the promised land
[47:06] none of them I don't think as far as I
[47:08] know drove out those in the valley
[47:11] judges 1 27.
[47:15] neither
[47:16] did Manassa drive out the enhancements
[47:23] verse 20-28
[47:26] but what took place
[47:28] and it came to pass when Israel was
[47:31] strong notice
[47:32] they did not drive him out but the Bible
[47:34] said God blessed them just like in the
[47:36] time of Egypt they were greater than
[47:38] Egyptians in the Egyptians had to bring
[47:41] them down right made them slaves
[47:43] but when Israel prospered in the
[47:45] Promised Land
[47:47] they would rather take money
[47:50] from the inhabitants than driving them
[47:51] out they'd rather compromise with the
[47:54] word of God and get a financial blessing
[47:58] pay tribute that's money gold silver
[48:00] shekels
[48:02] however you want to say it
[48:04] and they were content
[48:06] with letting the devil live there as
[48:08] long as they were getting financial gain
[48:11] as long as they were naturally or
[48:12] monetarily blessed
[48:14] sounds like laodicea
[48:18] now notice here verse 29.
[48:22] neither did Ephraim drive out the
[48:24] Canaanites verse 30 neither did Zebulon
[48:28] drive out the inhabitants
[48:30] but notice they became tributaries once
[48:33] again sold out
[48:34] for money even when they could have
[48:36] drove them out even when they had enough
[48:38] power and military force and might they
[48:40] said we'd rather have the money
[48:46] 31. neither did Asher drive out the
[48:49] inhabitants of the land
[48:50] neither no no snow here
[48:53] 32.
[48:56] but the asteroids dwelled among the
[48:57] canines the inhabitants of land but they
[49:00] did for they did not drive them out
[49:02] verse 33.
[49:04] neither did enough tally drive out the
[49:06] inhabitants of
[49:08] Beth Shemesh nor the habits of all these
[49:10] other ones but notice they sold out for
[49:12] money as well
[49:13] once One Tribe
[49:16] started just taking tributaries even
[49:19] though none of them could drive him out
[49:20] once one started collecting the money
[49:21] all the rest
[49:23] we're gonna do the exact they followed
[49:25] suit to organization
[49:27] well the prophet God would call it the
[49:29] golden calf scheme
[49:35] remember this is the type of the New
[49:38] Testament
[49:42] was not our forefathers supposed to keep
[49:44] the inhabitants the Devils the the
[49:46] Nicolaitans out of the church
[49:48] and little by little they let them in
[49:50] and what they brought them neglected
[49:52] what brought financial gain they brought
[49:54] this and that and all these things
[49:55] funding and organization program all
[49:57] those sort of things
[50:00] like I said
[50:02] I think it's one of the church ages says
[50:03] oh actually in the first one he says
[50:05] Thou hatest thou hatest the Deeds of the
[50:08] Nicolaitans right
[50:10] well when it goes down back then to two
[50:13] or three more Church ages uh God said he
[50:15] says I also hate those deeds but then
[50:17] the Bible says they didn't hate him
[50:18] anymore
[50:19] it didn't it didn't bother them anymore
[50:22] they had gotten cold and formal to it so
[50:24] so now let's continue on here verse 34.
[50:30] and now Dan which was the seventh tribe
[50:34] for the the eagle the north Camp the
[50:37] north tribe he's as an amorites Force
[50:39] the children down into the mountain
[50:42] they couldn't even they tried but they
[50:44] got forced in he says well they would
[50:46] not suffer them to come down into the
[50:48] valley
[50:51] this is the type of the church ages
[50:52] right here
[50:54] no one fully took the land just like I
[50:57] said in the prophet God said in the
[50:59] Feast of the the trumpets he says the
[51:02] Holy Ghost has been bound for a thousand
[51:05] or two thousand years one was abound all
[51:08] the way down to what 53 A.D is when now
[51:11] they did not they moved from what moved
[51:13] to organization moved to denomination
[51:15] and what the Holy Spirit his power his
[51:17] glory all that was now bound
[51:19] and they would and they've never seen a
[51:21] full release of those things amen sure
[51:24] now
[51:26] now notice here judges two and one
[51:29] and the angel Lord came from gilgal to
[51:32] bochum he says and said I've made you to
[51:34] go out of Egypt and brought you out you
[51:36] out into the land where I swear on your
[51:37] fathers and I said I I will never break
[51:40] my Covenant with you notice
[51:43] the Covenant of the Holy Ghost is still
[51:45] with us it is still possible to have the
[51:48] joy the victory the uh all that God has
[51:51] promised you know what they're going
[51:54] through the Old Testament he said what
[51:56] their teeth never waxed old their
[51:57] clothes never waxed oldies their shoes
[51:58] never actual he said they were in
[52:00] perfect the amounts of they were in
[52:01] perfect health all the way through that
[52:04] and now in the time of the Holy Ghost we
[52:06] should have perfect health we should
[52:07] have all those things all those promises
[52:10] are ours yes
[52:12] he said now notice he says but you have
[52:14] not obeyed my voice he says why have you
[52:16] done this but now notice
[52:19] therefore I said also I will not drive
[52:22] them out from before you now notice God
[52:24] says if you're not going to fight
[52:27] I'm not going to fight for you
[52:29] there's some things and I'm to be honest
[52:31] there's some things in my life
[52:33] I've been Lord take it from me take me
[52:35] he wants me to take it
[52:38] he wants me to put this thing in order
[52:43] let me tell you something you I'll say
[52:44] this the Bible says uh I'll say it like
[52:47] this through the anointing of the Holy
[52:49] Ghost and by Obedience of his word you
[52:51] have more strength and you know
[52:53] [Laughter]
[52:58] he says but they shall be his thorns in
[53:00] your size anyone got any thorns on their
[53:01] sides anything that what them that one
[53:04] punch the devil's got at you the one
[53:06] punch we just have to pray through or
[53:07] however what God wants us to take that
[53:10] thing away put on he wants us to put the
[53:12] holy spirit before what and put a hedge
[53:14] right there amen
[53:17] absolutely I I need that too as well
[53:20] he got he said and their God shall be a
[53:22] snare unto you
[53:25] amen now
[53:28] that's where they got that
[53:31] I'm sure as soon as though inhabitants
[53:33] of that Promised Land
[53:35] realized they their God would would
[53:38] never give that now they said they had
[53:40] they had all this testimony
[53:42] Moses did this and Moses did this and
[53:45] Jehovah did this and Jehovah this and
[53:46] yet
[53:47] it happens to land hundreds and hundreds
[53:49] years like hey we still got this Valley
[53:53] they become what mockers sure at the old
[53:56] at the end time saying oh where is the
[53:58] god of their fathers where is it
[54:00] knowing there's coming a time here
[54:02] shortly where the anointing of the Holy
[54:04] Ghost is going to strike and we are
[54:06] going free I'm talking free free
[54:10] I mean Super free
[54:13] where the bosses with the Spear of the
[54:16] Lord is there is Liberty absolutely and
[54:19] there's coming a liberty to the bride of
[54:21] Christ I mean I wonder if that's why
[54:23] brother yes we were we grew up in the
[54:25] Liberty Center what they call us the
[54:28] Sons of Liberty
[54:31] yes we found this power the only spot
[54:34] where Liberty is available amen and that
[54:36] is what now through the through the
[54:37] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and
[54:39] it guarantees you gives you the promise
[54:41] of the holy spirit amen absolutely
[54:43] praise me to God everything everything
[54:45] in your life means something amen praise
[54:49] God yeah we can relate yes
[54:52] now notice
[54:54] in Jeremiah 2 and 7 he says and I
[54:56] brought you into the piranha Pinnacle
[54:58] Country to eat the fruit the earth and
[55:00] the goodness there ever he says but when
[55:02] he entered he says you defiled my land
[55:04] and made my inheritance he says my
[55:06] Heritage and Abomination Saints are gone
[55:09] we've got to a lot cleaner we've got to
[55:11] get more Sanctified more sincere more in
[55:15] love with Jesus Christ
[55:17] so it's not not legalism it's not law
[55:20] but it's love
[55:23] ly we wake up and we read the Bible or
[55:25] we'll write at night read the Bible and
[55:27] say Lord
[55:28] I battled this today and I saw this
[55:30] today and I seen myself slip a little
[55:32] bit I took a couple of steps stumbled he
[55:34] said but Lord tomorrow it's going to be
[55:36] on again and I want this I want to I
[55:38] want to say no because I love him more
[55:41] because I love you more Lord Jesus amen
[55:43] that's why I want to that's why I wanna
[55:45] have a victory because I say I just love
[55:46] the Lord I don't want nothing to do with
[55:48] it amen I love his word I know his word
[55:50] contains life it's the only form of
[55:52] eternal life the Bible said well he says
[55:55] he's a search descriptions for in me he
[55:56] says in them he says you'll find eternal
[55:58] life and that's that's where we're going
[55:59] to look
[56:00] amen sure
[56:02] now
[56:09] we're on we're in we're in the anti-type
[56:13] the Old Testament was a type
[56:15] or the answer type we're the real thing
[56:17] now notice what the Bible says in the
[56:19] Old Testament Deuteronomy 11 verse
[56:23] 8 deuterine eleven oh this is not there
[56:26] Deuteronomy 11 say verse 8 says
[56:28] therefore shall you keep all the
[56:30] Commandments which I have commanded you
[56:32] this day that you may be strong and go
[56:34] and possess the land where you may
[56:35] possess that you may possess it he says
[56:37] he said that you may prolong your days
[56:38] in the land which the Lord swear unto
[56:40] your fathers to give them to their seed
[56:42] a land that fills them with milk and
[56:44] with Honeys it's for the land which thou
[56:45] thou goest to possess it is not a land
[56:48] of Egypt this is not we're not supposed
[56:50] to be like the Catholic Church we're not
[56:51] supposed to be like the world anything
[56:53] like the world he says from when she
[56:56] came he says Thou so is thy seed and
[56:57] washed it with thy foot as the garden of
[56:59] herbs he says but the land where you go
[57:01] to possess it is a land of Hills and
[57:04] Valleys
[57:07] and drink at the water of the reign of
[57:09] Heaven
[57:10] now notice what he says about this land
[57:12] in This Promise totally goes for land
[57:14] look what the look what God says about
[57:17] this land
[57:18] and the land which the Lord thy God
[57:20] careth for
[57:22] well I'm all alone
[57:24] and nobody cares about me nobody loves
[57:26] me man I'm just battling this by myself
[57:28] the Bible says in the land which the
[57:30] Lord God God careth for the eyes of the
[57:33] Lord are thy God the Lord thy God yeah
[57:37] absolutely he's Lord and God what of Our
[57:39] Lives he says are always upon it from
[57:43] the beginning of the year even to the
[57:46] end of the year
[57:48] you know what that includes that
[57:50] includes the leap year absolutely
[57:52] [Laughter]
[57:55] everything they got to add to it he says
[57:56] what he says Promised Land he says I'm
[57:58] watching over 24 7 365. he says none of
[58:01] you going to go down the way
[58:02] everything's in my control don't worry
[58:04] he says I love if you were in the Holy
[58:06] Ghost I love you amen he says because
[58:08] that Old Testament land is a type of me
[58:10] Amen in the spirit of God absolutely
[58:15] he is always watching you
[58:20] I'll be like this I was when I first
[58:22] come in the message and I heard this
[58:24] word and I was just like but then when
[58:25] the revelations the Bible says with much
[58:28] knowledge comes much sorrow
[58:30] I'll tell you what when you come in this
[58:31] message and you realize there's Judas
[58:33] and you realize there's faults in this
[58:35] and this I you battle those things in
[58:38] your mind and one day I was at this one
[58:40] job and I was running I was cleaning
[58:42] these steel parts and I was Dripping in
[58:43] this uh these uh metal uh like the
[58:46] polishers of these stones
[58:49] and I said a prayer I said Lord
[58:52] could you show me if I'm bride
[58:55] I hope my eyes just real simple prayer I
[58:57] hope my eyes and I'm watching these
[58:59] pieces tumbling this rock tumbler and
[59:01] one by one
[59:02] these little pyramid-shaped rocks
[59:04] started coming up out
[59:07] and I just rushing the message and I
[59:08] know about pyramids now I know about
[59:11] Capstone Revelations
[59:12] and I took those stones like huh and
[59:16] another one came up
[59:17] you want me came up
[59:19] five
[59:21] five
[59:22] b-r-i-d-e and that last one was a tiny
[59:25] little Capstone that had holes all over
[59:27] I called the holy Stone
[59:29] hey man that's Grace that's Jesus what
[59:32] that's broad amen that's Faith think
[59:34] about number five well brother that was
[59:36] The Coincidence was it well I kept
[59:38] watching for the next full hour when I
[59:39] was in that no other pyramid rocks came
[59:41] up
[59:42] I still got on my desk today
[59:45] but what but what that's a revelation
[59:48] those what what I was in my low spot I
[59:51] was in a low valley and I said a little
[59:52] prayer Lord and my bride and he's he's

[1:00:17] and service but what he says you are my
[1:00:20] bride you are the very wife of God
[1:00:29] you know why that judgment hits Great
[1:00:31] Tribulation
[1:00:33] because for 2000 years churches have
[1:00:35] tried to get the Holy Ghost in a way and
[1:00:37] right at the end Ace a church
[1:00:39] individuals will find the Holy Ghost in
[1:00:41] such a way
[1:00:43] and when that devil as the prophet God
[1:00:45] says tries to begin his cowardly plot
[1:00:48] to take out the very wife the Bride of
[1:00:51] Jesus Christ
[1:00:52] God says not this time buddy he comes
[1:00:55] down sweeps him up in the Rapture and
[1:00:57] then drops the judgments of God on them
[1:00:59] don't you ever touch God's
[1:01:05] his wife is what his anointed
[1:01:09] hey everybody because remember the same
[1:01:11] light that was in Jesus will be in you
[1:01:13] and of Christ was anointed you are
[1:01:15] anointed today man praise be to God
[1:01:25] continue on here I don't know Hollywood
[1:01:30] I like what the prophet says here
[1:01:31] somebody says I'll tell you what we need
[1:01:33] today is a is back to the old Bible
[1:01:35] again
[1:01:38] we hear the quotes we hear the quotes
[1:01:39] and those things are fantastic but let's
[1:01:42] bring these quotes back to the word
[1:01:45] I'll say it like this just a simple
[1:01:47] little study
[1:01:48] Hills and Valleys there's no quotes on
[1:01:50] Hills and Valleys by the prophet the Old
[1:01:53] Testament although they couldn't drive
[1:01:54] out there
[1:01:55] I couldn't find any Hills and Valleys a
[1:01:57] little bit I couldn't find it but what
[1:01:58] we go back to the Bible and we see
[1:02:01] what's hidden in there we see because
[1:02:03] remember you read the Old Testament
[1:02:04] you're reading about where you're at too
[1:02:07] the Old Testament is just as Rich if not
[1:02:10] more
[1:02:12] than the new I'm telling you brother
[1:02:14] Justice I mean just as a teacher I mean
[1:02:16] he can preach to teach I mean he got it
[1:02:17] all he's got the
[1:02:18] just run them Shadows run them types
[1:02:20] they're right there and it's beautiful
[1:02:22] every per every Old Testament Prophet
[1:02:24] every Old Testament man woman you can
[1:02:26] see the type right there from the
[1:02:27] Gentile wives in Christ the lineage all
[1:02:30] the way well to to the Kings and to the
[1:02:31] to the judges to the prophets all those
[1:02:33] things say shadow type the
[1:02:35] Christ and his bride yeah
[1:02:41] he says back to the old-fashioned
[1:02:43] Pentecostal teaching in the Bible he
[1:02:45] says back to the Holy Ghost back to the
[1:02:46] power of God back to all my prayer
[1:02:48] readings he says where they'd hunger and
[1:02:49] thirsting for God and I'll tell you what
[1:02:51] I say this humbly
[1:02:54] reverely
[1:02:57] but every time I come and teach here
[1:02:59] Pastor Jesse invites me to come teach
[1:03:01] you
[1:03:01] I walk in here this door right there and
[1:03:04] I walk in that door and I'm walking
[1:03:05] right here
[1:03:08] your pastor is praying right here
[1:03:13] I don't know
[1:03:15] if there's another Pastor in this
[1:03:16] message and when a guest Minister there
[1:03:19] he's at the altar praying through
[1:03:23] I say that
[1:03:25] to glorify Jesus Christ
[1:03:30] it struck me today when I walked in and
[1:03:33] I said
[1:03:34] is there another Pastor that does this
[1:03:38] he's praying through
[1:03:40] for God to speak to you
[1:03:44] that's a Watchman that's a shepherd
[1:03:48] I'm not trying to glorify
[1:03:50] that's one thing
[1:03:52] consistency
[1:03:54] determination determination
[1:03:56] amen so you know that's just something I
[1:03:58] noticed and really struck home tonight
[1:04:02] back to online prayer meetings back to
[1:04:04] where they're hungry and thirsting for
[1:04:04] God he was was Pastor just doing hungry
[1:04:06] and thirsting for God to move here in
[1:04:08] such a way greater the saints of God we
[1:04:10] should be going higher and higher and
[1:04:12] higher in the Holy Ghost
[1:04:15] there's coming a time or below a man's
[1:04:17] gonna be skipping before he gets into
[1:04:19] the church
[1:04:21] tell us toba's gonna be like this
[1:04:23] the skirt you know hey
[1:04:26] [Laughter]
[1:04:29] because the anointing of God is going to
[1:04:31] come
[1:04:32] and it will not leave
[1:04:36] the closer we get to God the closer we
[1:04:38] get with you
[1:04:40] and if you stay if you if if if you
[1:04:43] abide in me and I and you and you abide
[1:04:45] in my words
[1:04:47] ask what you will
[1:04:49] think about this if you're walking with
[1:04:52] Christ and the Holy Ghost and divine
[1:04:54] love because remember whatever God's
[1:04:56] will is will then become your will
[1:05:00] and you'll see one of those capitals
[1:05:02] wild cats run out in the back there and
[1:05:04] and Lydia's out here walking like this
[1:05:05] and just praising God and this and that
[1:05:07] one of them little cats is hurt wounded
[1:05:08] and the spirit of God sees that wounded
[1:05:10] creature
[1:05:11] and she'll wait and finally something
[1:05:13] say go and pray over
[1:05:15] you know raise it right up
[1:05:17] but what we have to weigh on the mind of
[1:05:19] God
[1:05:20] but the anointing will be there in such
[1:05:22] a way now
[1:05:24] let's continue on here I don't want to
[1:05:25] keep it all night here
[1:05:27] 's another Prophet said there would be a
[1:05:28] day it would not call day or night it
[1:05:30] would be a kind of a gloomy a dismal day
[1:05:32] he says we've had that kind of a day
[1:05:33] he's we've had a day in the last uh for
[1:05:35] the last 2000 years we've had meetings
[1:05:37] and accept Jesus as God's son and as our
[1:05:40] savior and we've seen God do great
[1:05:41] things among us has not gone done great
[1:05:43] things
[1:05:45] well the third time I went to Thailand I
[1:05:47] went to the biggest church in Thailand
[1:05:48] they call him the Billy Graham of
[1:05:50] Thailand
[1:05:51] he's had nine people
[1:05:54] of AIDS
[1:05:55] in fact the very day me and brother
[1:05:57] Randy were there
[1:05:58] his wife went over and prayed over blind
[1:06:00] lady and she received her sight like
[1:06:01] that
[1:06:02] not even don't even believe the message
[1:06:04] but they have the power of God in such a
[1:06:06] way
[1:06:08] the day I was there the pastor was like
[1:06:11] he's all he's an older gentleman he's
[1:06:12] like
[1:06:16] he's healed I was like what
[1:06:18] I said praise be to God brother
[1:06:24] he says now notice God's been doing
[1:06:25] great things among us he says and yet
[1:06:27] it's been a long time since that
[1:06:28] Pentecostal Light 2 000 years we made
[1:06:31] organizations built Big schools had
[1:06:33] systems he says when we find out in the
[1:06:35] seventh Church age we find out we've
[1:06:37] missed something there's something wrong
[1:06:41] we've gotten to a desert all the fruits
[1:06:43] has dried up that's what the Pentecostal
[1:06:45] Church did today she organized herself
[1:06:47] so tight till it's against one another
[1:06:49] until we found out that all the fruits
[1:06:52] was dried up we don't have no love peace
[1:06:53] Joy long suffering Fellowship like we
[1:06:55] ought to have we had the beginning the
[1:06:57] fruits have all dried up in the deserts
[1:06:59] now notice
[1:07:00] he says he's dealing with the seven days
[1:07:02] they're traveling from uh from Egypt on
[1:07:04] he says seven days without uh going
[1:07:07] without finding the real living God
[1:07:09] where you run off a little isms God gave
[1:07:12] Luther justification he run off with it
[1:07:14] easily gave Wesley sanctification he ran
[1:07:16] off Pentecostal people speak in tongues
[1:07:17] they run off with it God wants us to
[1:07:19] call wants to call us together in unity
[1:07:21] of power to bring back the fullness of
[1:07:24] the Holy Ghost into the church again and
[1:07:26] with all the spiritual gifts and
[1:07:28] operation in every local body
[1:07:32] because that is the pattern
[1:07:35] that was the book of Acts and I said
[1:07:37] I'll say like this
[1:07:38] do you realize
[1:07:40] us we're the we're the last bit
[1:07:44] that was started from a one Church
[1:07:46] Revival in the book of Acts
[1:07:49] that was a one Church local church 120
[1:07:53] in that local church
[1:07:54] and it started
[1:07:56] the life
[1:07:57] and we are now offsprings of that
[1:08:00] but all it takes is one local church to
[1:08:03] get into that kind of a situation and
[1:08:06] that kind of a card
[1:08:08] and it's going to do something
[1:08:12] absolutely
[1:08:13] the promise is there he said well Jesus
[1:08:15] said he says I will restore
[1:08:19] and every Pastor is striving towards
[1:08:21] that brother Jesse's right here striving
[1:08:24] for that service after Services children
[1:08:26] pray you guys are afraid we're praying
[1:08:28] what for more of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:08:30] Lord reveal yourself just like you want
[1:08:33] to amen and Lord not my will but thine
[1:08:35] be done amen
[1:08:37] yes sure now
[1:08:40] he says you know everybody wants a
[1:08:42] Hilltop experience and they never want
[1:08:44] to take the
[1:08:49] man we love dancing this is absolutely
[1:08:50] but remember everything that produced
[1:08:53] everything that joy that satisfaction
[1:08:56] that freedom that Liberty that comes up
[1:08:58] and those things
[1:09:00] take that with you because of that
[1:09:02] growth that takes place that boldness
[1:09:05] that takes place here take those fruits
[1:09:07] of boldness and joy and peace and love
[1:09:09] and take it out there
[1:09:11] but a lot of times we get into those
[1:09:14] things and the fruits grow so fast
[1:09:16] because we're right there in the
[1:09:17] presence of God and what his remember
[1:09:19] those are necessarily our fruits those
[1:09:21] are fruits of the spirit
[1:09:24] those are here that's what pretty that's
[1:09:26] what he produces on us and if we take
[1:09:28] those out into the world oh my
[1:09:34] God but a lot of times
[1:09:36] if you stay up there too long the
[1:09:37] prophet God he says those fruits will
[1:09:39] freeze
[1:09:40] and you'll notice that when you the
[1:09:42] first hard time that comes along
[1:09:45] foreign
[1:09:52] because you're so angry
[1:10:00] and I'm not bringing I I when I heard

[1:10:09] absolutely with you into the world
[1:10:11] absolutely yes absolutely let that
[1:10:14] what's produced right here
