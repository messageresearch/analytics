========================================

and uh you know a lot of times you said just to trust the lord and always trust that you're blessed with this morning just realizing the positional placement god's trying to do in your life and this evening we'll we'll just bring another thought i've been ministering this uh recently at the church uh so greetings from deploying ohio i forgot to do this morning we'll do it tonight and uh anyway we we see that we might not be able to hook up here and i'm gonna need to hook up so i might have to get my uh get my powerpoint maybe it's one of these hdmis maybe it's not now do you have an hdmi adapter to there brother i got excited i thought i could get by just using my laptop but sometimes stuff gets a little finicky it's not there it is yeah maybe maybe not you have to press on yours to project um let's try this appreciate your patience brother sister i got all excited thinking i wouldn't have to do that one extra step but you know you can't skip steps sometimes and that's uh very true with the word of god and the way the lord moves and i'll tell you what i can get something can you give me a second here how many love the lord appreciate him give me a moment here and we'll get things to move right over and i've done this a few times you know as your pastor taught me how to do all this stuff and uh with the lord's help we we realized that uh still we don't have much ability this is a couple minute process but we do appreciate all the lords doing in your lives and uh i heard there's a lot of birthdays here so we rejoice at that and uh always thank god for a special time yesterday with my son's birthday and uh we we sure love the lord and give me a minute like i said and we'll try to just ramble on and just start talking but uh we'll get her on there just uh give me a second here praise god and uh i don't mean to keep you standing um you probably could sing uh sing another song it's one of those awkward moments just keeping it stuck aren't you glad for technology you know the other day uh we had we had a second service at the church and and brother simon his whole technology had failed him and he and he handled his ser and it deleted his entire sermon he was going to do second service so i walked back there and he said brother i don't i don't have it my brother it's five minutes till we start i learned the definition scripturally of instant in season and uh brother jesse i think he listened to that just so i ended up just running up there and just doing a bible study on the former ladder rain yes that was good before when i did that the atmosphere was uh just phenomenal as far as i felt anointed but because i wasn't fully prepared at the time seemed like it was a little bit challenging for me but everybody said they were blessed your pastor said praise the lord when he got a hold of that so amen we rejoice in these things so now let's try this again we will overcome and we'll overcome yeah there we go the scripture says with your patience possess ye your sins so you've had a really good move of that tonight so god be praised and let's open up our bibles to a few places here um i'm going to try to go through uh four services and one i will skip a lot but i want to hit some highlights for you amen and uh i trust this will be a blessing to you uh one thing i find is that this this bible just keeps on opening and vindicating and proving uh that the message that god sent through william branham was 100 correct amen so uh i know you're going to have to fight for a few amens tonight you have to fight through for that because the devil will fight you with tired fatigue and and uh and whatever you ate for dinner there everybody looked like they had lovely food and uh not just lovely but beautiful food and uh that's so nice to see um here if we can we'll read second samuel 7 verse 1. it says it came to pass when the king sat in this house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies but the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains so notice what david is he is concerned about the ark amen not trying to make a building not trying to make this of that he's concerned about the ark and what is the art the word okay yes and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying go and tell my servant david thus saith the lord shalt thou build me in house for me to dwell in all right one more passage first chronicles 22 verse 7 and we'll pray let you have your seats and uh we'll just start letting the lord have his way amen let me know you're going to receive something from the lord tonight amen amen one thing about uh the scripture we love to eat the book that's right we get strength from that uh we get confidence and that we're believing the truth through that and what our faith rises when you hear that all right chronicles 22 7 and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build and house unto the name of the lord my god you want to build a house to the name of the lord is god okay but the word of the lord came to me saying thou has shed blood abundantly and has made great wars thou shalt not build and house under my name because thou has shed much blood upon the earth in my sight behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days he shall build a house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel forever i just went through a big giant tight and i'm going to go a whole different type because we understand that david was a type of christ david had to shed the blood but he was not to build the house okay right so he's a perfect type of christ he had to what the the scripture says that he put all the enemies under his feet david did so that the man of rest could come forth which was the holy ghost because he said well the holy ghost is unrest and solomon is a type of the rest okay that's a whole that's that's old testament first church age right there i'm sure your pastor will go through it one of these days it's a beautiful thing so let's bow our heads forward to prayer i'll let you have your seats or let you remain to stand if you'd like to join me at attention bless by our hands lord jesus we sure love you we appreciate all the love and mercy that you have for us trying to figure out which way to go this night uh for you lord and we're just asking oh god as this is the direction we uh we've come now lord that you just bless it be with it allow to build strength and revelation and faith to the believer to the church tonight oh god lord uh this is an army that's right before you right now and lord we understand we're not supposed to be faint in this hour but oh god uh even as the scripture says is that in the old testament the priests would get before the people before they were sent out to war and say that god would give them a victory he would say the word of victory to them that's all that would have to happen the priests would give them the word and they would go out and fight for victory oh god we're asking tonight as we once again approach this word may there be a blessing that will come upon the people god they'll have strength to fight another day to fight to the next service to fight oh god until thy thy close coming lord yes we're just believing uh we thank you for this word we thank you that you're gonna preach it lord and we ask of god that revelation would be in our midst we receive it yes because there's one thing satan cannot fight this revelation gates of hell will not prevail against it and in this building there is a group that the gates of hell shall not prevail maybe so we speak in faith in the precious holy name of jesus christ the church says together amen once again we're blessed we love our brother we love you all church you're a beautiful people i love it when when god brings ghana over here and i get to see brother william i just rejoice have a wonderful time fellowshipping and uh and the rest of you we sure love and appreciate as well and uh we got laborers in the harvest and the apple harvest we got we got you name it it's here so uh and i'll tell you what i sit back there and i hear the voices worshiping god and i feel like i'm i feel like i'm in a heavenly place and then so i appreciate all those voices we hear amen but yet tonight we want to work with this idea we will not be able to do a full idea but we won't do an idea but we want to work tonight with the transition uh from tabernacle to temple all right so just get your spiritual like brother man say get your spiritual thinking caps on and uh let's see what we can do here to enjoy the word of god and find the word of god come to life for us amen we began to work here uh showing that god uh he would allow david to come by david as i spoke on zion last time i was here david would be the one to finish the battle in order to israel would be established in jerusalem or the city of peace amen and uh david was a perfect type of christ and uh david as our opening scripture showed he wanted to build the house of god amen now notice what he was wanting to do david was wanting and i'm going to keep saying this he was wanting to get the art from a temporary house and he was wanting to get it into a permanent place amen he said what he could look at himself he had a permanent house he could dwell in it was beautiful magnificent it was great but when he looked at the word he wanted the word to have a greater place that he had amen hallelujah and so will any christian when you see what god has done for you you want the word to have preeminence amen you are the word to what because ye are the temple of the living god and the word within you the bible says that the word is mighty even in my house amen hallelujah so you can speak that word yes you can believe that word and what the ark or the very soul of god wants to live in you amen amen amen amen but tonight we want to take this direction as the lord has given us we believe that we want to start by working with the transition from the tabernacle to the temple yes now notice here in exodus 25 verse 8 it says and let them make me a sanctuary here on mount sinai after they left egypt let them make me a sanctuary now notice why he wanted to give them a tabernacle that i may dwell among them amen god wanted a house or a place that he could dwell amongst his people hallelujah hallelujah that they could come and worship come receive him hallelujah and notice according to all that issue thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall he make it so the tabernacle did not come by chance it didn't come from a man's mind but actually god said he would give the pattern and make it exactly like i give it to you all right and what it was god was showing man that he wanted to dwell among them all right all right now let's begin here uh right here in exodus 19 i'm going to be quick with this all right but notice it says in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai in the third month now they're moving to mount sinai yes for they were departed from freedom and were come to the desert of sinai had pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped before the mount they were coming to mount sinai to meet god we see by exodus 19 right yes and notice now we see that there god actually gave them the opportunity to watch to come and meet him at mount sinai we still have pictures now oh how can man not believe in jesus christ amen when you can look and see mount sinai still charred at the top formal a living god connect with his people amen amen hallelujah i don't know if you can see it but a living god wants to come down and meet with you now amen and the more that you get the hunger for god to come the more he'll show himself amen hallelujah that's right because what his whole idea was to dwell among you to begin with amen amen now notice this idea very quickly here so in mount sinai israel chose law which was of course god's plan to show himself to his people god wanted to go that way it was his will for it to go that way even though he gave them a choice right right i mean the perfect way would have been to go this way but what would we miss if it didn't go that way you see how it's all a perfect move of the word of god amen and failure there's a perfect move god is trying to do through you amen amen hallelujah you see the israel could look very easy and say uh we might will just go to hell they can do it because they backslid on god every single time amen but god long suffering to show mercy he always came back to them amen and he said he would walk he would once again cure his people at the end time right he said he would draw them again but he won't do it until he's done with you hallelujah [Applause] now watch this so here we're going to begin talking about the tabernacle in exodus 40 17 it says and it came to pass in the first month in the second year on the first day of the month that the tabernacle was reared up in the third month was the idea of the tabernacle given to moses in the mount and yet in the first month of the next year the tabernacle was reared up yes we see there it was perfectly nine months from the conception of the tabernacle in the mine to bring it forth amen where it could be a tabernacle praise god hallelujah now i'm gonna get i'm gonna show you a few things here this might be a little bit it's gonna be something all right but notice so it took nine months from conception to the birth of that tabernacle that's right good all right now notice the idea is that it was a three uh had three different spots his soul spirit body god made it so that that tabernacle would be a representation that man would draw to that tabernacle to worship it amen amen amen hallelujah but remember the idea of that tabernacle was what it was given to get them from egypt to the promised land yes just like jesus christ the tabernacle was always a reference to one you had one word one ark you had one table of incense you had one table of shoebread you had one laver you had one menorah you had oh you had one uh uh what's that the altar of incense you had all those things everything was won yes amen hallelujah now watch this because as you see the tabernacle reared for a purpose the tabernacle was none other than showing jesus christ on his journey amen the bible says in john 1 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not i'm laying a foundation for you okay so notice jesus christ came to his own but his own received him not yeah right they didn't want him but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god amen even to them that believe on his name glory which were born not of blood nor the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of god that tells you right there that you are not here by chance [Applause] god might have let you fall in failure but it's not by chance amen he's going to rear a victory for you amen hallelujah amen but now notice this idea and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the tabernacle was the manifestation of jesus christ right right amen i'm going to show you this in just a little bit just hold on glory it was jesus christ remember the tabernacle was to take them to the promised land the promised land was a type of the holy ghost right that's right so jesus christ within the tabernacle that's why you see him seated in the whole thing because as the tabernacle was being reared up brought down and put back up and what god would send the pillar a fire by night and a cloud by day to lead them all the way right yeah he showed what he would be to his church in the wilderness amen and remember in john 6 they said they said oh oh he started talking about the manna and he said i am that bread of life that came down right yes that tabernacle with that word or that word that ark was to get them to a permanent place amen that's why jesus said he said it is expedient that i go away how could that possibly be exceeding to be more beneficial to not have jesus christ god walking amongst you right how could it not be more experience not walking with you if only the greater benefit would be that god would walk in you that's right yes i guess i asked a question it might be a little bit uh awkward maybe even an answer but since would you rather have a living brother we didn't really let's give a seat for jesus here okay let's let jesus sit there would you rather would you think that would be more expensive to have jesus right there or would you rather have or think that is more expedient with the message that god actually gave you yes that jesus wouldn't sit here but jesus would take the throne of your hearts amen amen yes to manifest his will to be done inside of you amen hallelujah hallelujah so notice that tabernacle brought them into the wilderness through the wilderness now if you get in the old testament you look up that word willingness you'll actually see that it actually means teaching as well one of the sub the sub definitions is teaching the wilderness was the teaching right to bring them to the promised land that's why scripturally you can see that the four gospels guard the book of acts amen and everything you see from the book of acts it can be proven by those gospels that's right the gospels were the throne guards to the book of acts amen not then just the acts of the apostles but the acts of the holy ghost through the apostles amen all right amen hallelujah amen now i'm going to be very basic and very quick with this if i can that tabernacle was for the jew now i'm going to say this in a way that you'll see it especially when i get to it later here the jews were given the tabernacle from mount sinai well the gentiles were not involved right it was to get them there hallelujah yes the jews also built the tabernacle it was a jewish move yes hallelujah just like we read he came to his own and they received him not right hallelujah amen so they would have to be a manifestation to make the clear word of god progress from one idea to the next hold on this was to go about to get the children to the main place they were supposed to be yes there you have a pillar of fire at night they're all encamped around it just like jesus christ he went about doing good they would flock him hallelujah and what he was doing is he was doing the good remember as they were going through the wilderness their clothes didn't even wax hold they didn't get sick as long as they stayed with that tabernacle and ordering them they were what just as good as almost invincible right outside of the fathers that had to die off and mixed multitude hallelujah just as jesus christ went about doing good yes he was he lived 30 years in a life but the end the ministry was to get the people to something all right yes we have here the moving about of the worship of god but we've seen in our opening scriptures that god was actually trying to get it to a permanent spot yes david in his flesh seeing what it was coming to and was trying to fulfill that right but his position typically was not to actually build the temple it was actually to what fight the battles finish the battles shed the blood and let the let solomon his son bring on the temple amen so we have here from a wilderness the traveling on to now a permanent establishment that god would do through the temple right like so i'm trying to do this through through four sermons it might be a little bit difficult but we're going to try to do it all right it says acts of holy spirit now here's my idea of it brother that temple there represented the temple spiritual the temple we're now in they come into the temple for their blessings we are baptized into the temple of god you know the prophet said he said he said that jesus was that tabernacle right amen they come into the temple for the blessing we are baptized into the temple of god into the body of god into the body of jesus christ and we're in christ by holy spirit baptism first corinthians 12 and there is now therefore no condemnation to them in christ jesus romans 8 1 that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit they desire spiritual things amen amen we're talking about tabernacle to a temple manifestation amen identifying just a little bit here so just hold on watch us he's saying that the temple was the spiritual movement of god for you watch what he says they desire spiritual things they don't care about the fleshly things my flesh says i'm too tired anybody's flesh saying that tonight your flesh will tell you that sure sure your flesh will tell you oh god that brother can't hit the 30 minutes uh streak here right but look your flesh says i'm too tired but your spirit says you're not i'm your boss follow me amen [Applause] glory so we're not looking at a situation where um where the spirit is reeling but the flesh is weak we have now moved to a greater manifestation when we can actually put the flesh under our feet get up and worship god amen that's what these things do amen hallelujah because ultimately it's not it's not it's not me saying sister naomi oh you're you're flesh ain't tired get up you know your flesh i'll wash your flesh around but it's an individual revelation you realize that this is temporal and what is eternal is inside of you amen amen christ or paul would say by the spirit of christ ye are the temple of the living god amen amen amen the temple is a spiritual move done to a spiritual people accepting it that's right now watch us i want you to see this this is this is the beginning of our we're going to be moving here first chronicles 22 verse 5 and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnificable i love that put that together exceeding magnifical hallelujah closely amen that sounds pretty good hallelujah but notice from a transition from the tabernacle to the temple it had to be exceeding magnificent magnifical from what the tabernacle was amen it was a greater manifestation of jesus christ hallelujah amen notice it was to be watched of fame and the glory throughout all the countries notice the temple was not to just be something moving them through the wilderness yes it played its parts in jericho they already heard about it they're already scared about it all right brother good but now god was wanting a temple to do that yes throughout all the countries i will therefore now make preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death hallelujah just as jesus christ did everything on the spiritual realm and natural realm that needed to be conquered amen he was the all in all this jesus christ amen i mean there's not one thing that he left untouched even so much of the fact is that he's able to secure them that are tempted because he and always likewise was tempted as you are yes he is able to be a comfort to you because he cares for you amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah we're getting ready to make a turn here i want you to see this because remember jesus said it'd be expedient right it was good that he goes away so the next manifestation remember he said he said i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you it was something god was trying to do saying chronicles 510 here it is i'm going to jump up and jump back but it said in second chronicles 5 10 there was nothing in the ark say two tables which moses put therein at when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then await by course also the levites which were the singers all of them of a asaph haman a judith with their sons and their brother being raiden white linen having symbols and sultries and hearts stood the east and the altar and with them notice it's capitalized 120 priests sounding with trumpets amen in dedication of lee was 59 if i remember right brother branham said that there it was in that dedication message he said there was a hundred and twenty that were trumpeting out because what it does is it puts the scripture in line that the number of those names together were about 120 so god and through our prophet would tell us i believe it's in 54 where he said that solomon's day was a type of the holy ghost falling on the church because notice what happened it came to pass as a trumpeter series where as one they were in one place and one accord that's right to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endures forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord amen so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god amen now notice the tithe because it is the same that's why god left the types in there but in the upper room that's what it was brother brown said it was a unifying time amen he said any time when the children of god get to a place like they were it'll bring the sound of a rushing mighty wind amen amen amen but look at this a lot of times we'll just leave that oh that's church look at that what happened but did you know that that was actually the start of what god was trying to do and he left it in the time that was it was a type of the upper room but it gave us the characteristics of what made it happen yes amen what are you saying what i'm saying is you got to tell your flesh i'm your boss [Music] because the types give us a greater picture of when it actually come forth we don't i mean it's written on paper there's only so much we have so god leaves the time so that you can see that what they were in one place in one a car but notice they were worshiping god they were thanking god they were lifting up their voice to such a place that the shekinah glory filled that house amen hallelujah you want to get there god shows us how to do it that's why they demonize us so much oh they're pentecostals they're not even in the message let them call you what you want if you can get that cloud down hallelujah it shows that god is at peace with what you're doing amen he's pleased with it he likes it and anytime you aim in that word any time you praise the lord with your heart that is a sign that god is what he's hallelujah because ultimately this should be our experience hallelujah they got persecuted after the gate of beautiful the scripture says they went and prayed in that one place they started they started praying to god worshiping god loving god and what the holy ghost shook that place you know your prophet said he said they needed that it was three or four days after the upper room that's right three or four days you see we should be going from pouring out to pouring out man hallelujah amen hallelujah so there you're 120. now let's begin to look at this here our transition continue in first kings 6 38 it says in the 11th year in the month of bull which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was he seven years in building hallelujah that's right we see the tabernacle was a nine nine-month conception birth and then it lived but when god did the temple it was to be manifested for seven years seven church ages one two three four five six seven it was to be a move over seven church ages now this is gonna get really pretty here in a second that's pretty to me right there how you got a seven up in there yep you got upper room and seven church changes hallelujah remember where this church is going is not just back to the book of acts you're going all the way through to our rapture amen amen to the full perfection right where god bless ephesus remember at least uh aimed at but relaxed you're going from being relaxed to fully aimed at it fully adapted fully positionally [Music] amen so now that's seven we also have seven church changes now watch this in mark 11 15 christ saying here it says and they came to jerusalem and jesus went to the temple began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it again of phoenix he said what that the temple was to be a house of prayer of all nations now watch so now the temple is beginning to pick up a characteristic of its type that jesus christ even himself said that it was a house of prayer for all nations now that's where it'll make a saint want to rejoice because you are not part of that jewish heritage amen yes yes now watch here it is solomon dedicating the temple he says moreover concerning a stranger he's talking about the stranger what's a stranger a gentile yes that's a stranger that is not of thy people israel but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake the temple was made to troll them from all over the place amen to that temple for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and are thy stretched out all when he shall come and pray towards this house now when you see the time you see all through his his dedication he's saying if they pray to this place the place of that temple amen it was a type of the baptism of the holy ghost that's why in revelations 2 in the ephesians church age he says he says repent and do the first works look hallelujah if you ain't got a first love then go back to when you knew he was your first love in him what were you doing there you were crying out right there fill me with your holy ghost you don't have to live in a backswing conditioning below [Applause] where christ himself came and filled that temple where the ark walks notice what it was god did not make a new art for that temple he transferred the original ark to the temple it was the same word yeah the whole way through amen i'll tell you what when it comes to the next temple being built it won't be a different arc it'll be the same arc that's right crazy because god's tithe is he said i am the lord and i change not amen [Applause] so now solomon's crying out in his dedication that the strangers are going to be drawn to this temple amen they're going to hear about this manifestation of the temple they're going to hear about 120 falling under the holy ghost they're gonna hear about it and they're going to be drawn to it amen see the jews didn't even figure that out that's why acts 10 was such a a shocking mind blow to them yes because the scripture says that they were in all that god let the holy ghost fall on the gentiles like he did then that's right amen hallelujah but they all they had to do was hear the same wire that's right yeah the glory see the manifestation and they received and god filled them they prophesied spoke of tongues yes yes you know he still does the same thing amen hallelujah yes so he says for they shall hear thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm when he shall come and pray towards this house yes hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all the strange all that the stranger calleth to thee for you mean solomon is so caught in the inspiration that he's crying out exactly what would happen as the gentiles receive this yes they'll hear about the god of israel and they'll come and accept it hallelujah and do according to all that the stranger calls to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and that they may know that this house which i have built and built it is called by thy name amen the baptism of the holy ghost was to magnify the name of jesus christ that's [Applause] on god for that he will bring it to you amen amen hallelujah because god wanted man to fall in love with his glory because look he he said that god would do to the stranger just like he would to a jew that's right now that is phenomenal because this is a time when the jew gentiles were not accepted that's right that's right that's why you're here right now that's right because god blinded israel when they rejected him and he went to the gentiles till the fullness of the gentiles come in that's right which is the rapture of the church right that's right right there the phone is the jedi it's almost here get in get along yes sir yes for that holy ghost cry out to this place and god will answer you remember when he said that god showed it in natural type i'm going to trump here god showed it in natural time that he would answer that remember jonah caught in the belly of the whale jonah caught the belly of whale he was what he was caught in death in the in this way on the bottom of the ocean that's right there he was the scripture says that he turned himself to the temple and cried out to god for mercy yes amen he prayed towards that place the natural is a type of the spiritual he prayed towards that place and what in a few days god spit him up on nineveh right and he finished the plan amen yes hezekiah the prophet came to isaiah came to him said you're a dead man amen make your house ready that's right the scripture says that isaiah turned himself to the wall amen amen yeah he read the commentaries it was the wall of the temple glory he returned himself and prayed to the wall and said lord give me 15 more years amen and god gave it to him amen wow beautiful if you want the holy ghost all you got to do is know where you come from [Applause] [Music] this temple is very open to the strangers very open look ephesians 2 19 now therefore ye are no more strangers that's right and foreigners glory but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom you are also building together for a habitation of god through the spirit i said i had to cuddle out but i trust you'll see it tonight because what god's trying to do he's trying to manifest that temple move through you yes hallelujah oh thank god that jesus christ tabernacled before us in flesh amen yes but the ultimate thing that was coming was a permanent place where the holy ghost would fall on them amen and they would be able to follow that out to amen to the rapture of the church all right it would be just as meaningful in uh uh in 1833 as it would be in a.d 2022. [Applause] there's no scaffold building up from this it's the same gospel the secret same holy ghost and god [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen [Applause] watch this this is beautiful second chronicles 2 17. it says in solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of israel the strangers that's you that's right after the numbering where dave and his father had numbered them and they were found a hundred and fifty three thousand and three thousand and six six hundred watches and he set three score and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens and four score thousand to be hewers in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work jumping down to our parallel first kings 9 22. but of the children of israel did solomon make no bonding but they were men of war his servants and his princes and his captains and his rulers of chariots and his horsemen all right what are you trying to say good game when god built the temple over these seven ages the vast majority of the work was done by gentiles amen amen yes and i love i love how king james explains it because he said that they were workers amen they were bears of burnings amen they could handle these gentile strangers in us could handle the pairing of bird and satan they hew out stones in a mountain amen hallelujah they were to do the work of the temple amen amen well what god let god left to israel just just do their thing without it right but the temple building was ordained to be done of the gentiles notice there was a little bit of work that was done by the jews and the king solomon raised a levee out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men and he sent them to level lebanon that's where they got the trees from ten thousand a month by quarters a month they were in lebanon two months at home and adanaram was over the levy so the jews now notice it wasn't all done by the gentiles but the vast majority of us all right so the jews were just doing a portion of it but the ultimate design to build the temple was to be moved by the gentiles i'm just going to rejoice [Applause] because the scripture says right there you can bear any burden amen you're here to build the temple of god amen until the capstone sets down you can build brilliant kindness you are born for you'll bear the burden if they reject you if they say anything nasty about you you can bear it and if your brother and sisters in pain are hurting you can bear that burden with them [Applause] remember christ was a healer ff bosworth he said he said in that he said many times people get sick and they get so weak he said that they can't even bear the burden he said the church would look at them and put them down i'm paraphrasing and put them down and think that they didn't have any faith he said but the church has it all wrong he said they were actually when they would see that person weak they would actually stand up and help bear the burden to get that same he said he said they would be so hard to have any faith so it would take the rest of the church to get behind that and why if they were in a good time raise their faith up amen amen bear the burden with them praise god hallelujah christ bear a cross for you amen that's why he said to you that you take up your cross and follow me amen amen he took the cross up the mount of calvary amen oh how could we not bear one another's burdens how could we not try to hew some stones out of the mountains because i'll tell you what where we're at in this age that's what it's like that's right you're you're up there trying to find all the pieces for the temple you know i ain't got time to go there but brother branham said that that those slow stones were taken from all over the place and what he ties into the scripture where he says ye are lively stones hallelujah those stones gotta come from somewhere somebody's got to dig them out amen oh god anoint the living church amen by the holy ghost to find those tools amen amen there's something ironic that god let the holy ghost fall on the jews and then very quickly within a few years there we see the gentiles and paul said i'll go no more to the to the jews amen hallelujah all right brother king what else is there okay say chronicles 3 3. so now these are the things wherein solomon was instructed for the building of the house of god the length bicubits after the first measure were three score uh cubits in the breath 20 humans all right you already read it i'm sure but when you look at the tabernacle the tabernacle was 10 cubits wide and then 30 cubits long but when god come lengthen went to build the temple he made it 20 cubits long wide and then he made it 60 cubits long yes he gave them a double portion amen of his spirit that's right this is one of the uncapped resources that's right in our hands that's right it's right in our hands now this is right where i left off with the church because this goes throughout the bible let me say a few things you know what god calls you the church of the firstborn yes the firstborn had a double portion of all that the rest of them had hallelujah that's you spiritually the firstborn hallelujah the blood had to be applied why for the elect first ball yes right not only that we see in the scripture god talks about the levites and he says that the levites would now be his first form too they would have the birth right now notice god himself calls it a birth right you have a right by your [Applause] don't settle for complacency [Applause] amen [Applause] i'm not going to get this into him but god actually multiplied numerous things in the temple to show the greater glory of what he was trying to produce but i want to go here real quick here let's go down the 11th verse he says believe me that i am the father and the father of me or else believe me for the very work state verily verily i send you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also so you will have a single portion of the holy ghost yes you'll be able to do the same things jesus did with what a single portion i'm talking about from your prophet because your prophet identified what this was numerous places hallelujah so doing the works of jesus that's a single portion well but he said what and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father your prophet said that was a double portion the greater works were a double portion right amen remember my price said this morning but but remember brother branham said just do the same works until he brings the double portion now watch this i want you to see this double portion and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the song whatever you ask says nature whatever you ask this beatrice whatever yours real man whatever you ask so what so that full glorification goes to the soul amen but he doesn't stop there does he he says it again if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it remember in the scripture you can take it back to the songs you take all over the place but a lot of times they repeat it wait on the way down the lord i say again i say wait on the lord right right and they say it twice to show you the emphasis that they're trying to place on it god just doesn't want you to ask and receive no he really wants you to ask in his name and receive it amen hallelujah you have not because you asked amen amen he said he'd do it amen amen oh god get this get us ready for this sickness hallelujah we're closer than we've ever been yes no notice second kings 2 8 said elijah took his mantle wrapped together smoked the waters there divided hither and together so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee then we just read that ask what i shall do well what did brother braham say elijah and unless you were a type of christ in the church right ask what i shall do for you before i be taken away from thee before i'll be taken away from them and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me notice this oh spoken word church all right elijah didn't say hey i bet you want a double portion why don't you ask for it it was already written on his heart right hallelujah now god left it in scripture so that you could see that this should be the crying out of your heart amen amen it ought to be from uh from sister lena's mouth oh god let there be a double portion come on in [Applause] remember it was god that built the holy ghost in such a way he could give you a double portion that's why it's a permanent place it's expedient it's great it's exceeding magnifical amen it is a great place [Applause] so now you don't even gotta figure it out all you gotta do is look at the word this is a revelation that's right you're the church see a lot of people say oh that's christ and brother branham good you know it's elijah it's got to be an elijah spirit well what spirit did brother branham not just elijah it was the holy ghost right so god actually sent the message to produce the same things as was done in the prophet or the angel as what he wanted to do in the church did i say something strange this is how underprivileged we are that's why everybody wants to put brother brandon on this pastor come on all right brother that's why i preach on the spiritual gifts about 12 servants and what blew me away was if you all would get in one accord in such a way that the holy ghost would fall and i had spiritual gifts on you brother branham told us exactly what that would do and that's what i said in first corinthians 14 this morning that the discerning of the thoughts and tense of heart will come right from you that's right sinner come in it'd come right up on you brother branham said that he said there would be he said it wouldn't be something just general he said but the holy ghost would be specific now you go back and study do you want the notes i got it but brother branham said he said he said sister so and so uh you were you know you were prostituting yourself yesterday or something like that and and this and then that and you're from new jersey and he said that's thus saith the lord it would come from tongues and interpretations it would come from prophecy right and it would be just as specific as the prophet that's right every circle thus saith the lord thus saith the lord and the laity is anybody else's mind going because that's what the original church was and that identification was in first first corinthians 14 where he said that if somebody had learned god it would call them directly out their needs their issues brother said he said it would be so specific in the church that there need be somebody that would need a healing and he said so and so you've come here from so and so spot and you have cancer thus say lord if you repent of of this addiction of smoking god will fill you with the holy ghost and heal you right now look look it up he said he talked about a court story where where he said these fanatical pentecostals uh they got in trouble because they were being loud and obnoxious and so forth with with their spiritualism and they went into the judge and they just started speaking rampantly in tongues and the judge said he said these people are lunatics lock them up ah here i am i'm on my tangent it's going this way and brother branham said he said it would have been different if they would have had it in order he said they would have said judge you did this thing last night how can you come against the elect of god with what you're calling us out for he said if they would have had it right and in order it would have turned the opposite way oh i wonder what we're getting ready to do i think a lot of times we just think oh glory to god i'm just going to sit in this chair uh holy ghost gonna follow that rain boom done i'm in heaven right right oh the american spirit it's going to be a squeeze right right yeah you know where he says physically bereft the deities are going out the door but it's got to be that way to get you into the spot god can do what he needs to do with you amen amen oh glory to god hallelujah elisha said let a double portion be on me yes amen and he said thou has asked a hard thing it's not an easy thing what you're supposed to have from christ there's only one nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass they still went on and taught that behold there up here to cherry to fire horses of fire and parted them both asundered and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven do you realize that god showed us how to get a double portion too because when elijah went up the mantle came back down well why did the mantle come back down the mantle came back down because elijah told elisha how to get the double portion that's right he had to solely look at elijah that's right it didn't matter if a little critter and game random ran by didn't matter if an alien flew across the sky i didn't care what the if somebody ran up in the news article and said watch out brother that's coming right he had to keep his eyes on elijah [Music] hallelujah you were born for a double portion how do i get it you've got to have your eyes solely on christ [Applause] you know why because it's a hard thing it was ordained to be this way that's right that's why brother branham said he said the hardest thing for god to do is to find one man that he can get solely set aside but think about it god is getting a whole bride ready for that amen amen by the hearing of the word right i got a lot more but i'm just gonna say a few more things i'll let you go hallelujah god hiding himself in simplicity he said god taking a humble sinner and cleansing him by his blood and dropping that confessed sin into the clorox bleach of the blood of the son of god and putting his own life into that man by the baptism of the holy ghost then if we have the genuine baptism of the holy ghost what's wrong with us when the time when elijah dropped the robe on elijah you've got a double portion of it jesus said the works that i do ye shall do also and greater than this shall you do for i go unto my father what's a wrong church it's right after the seas now you've called us beelzebub of visions and things like that get off my back brother get down to the cross get the gospel we don't have to impersonate why would you take an impersonation when uh why would you take some false conception of it when the skies are full of genuine pentecostal power that makes a man or woman a son or daughter of god and takes him back into the presence of god there you are god revealing himself in humility watch us you've got to get away from your own thoughts you've got to let the mind that was in christ be in you and you've got to stay there till every sin of fear every sin of doubt has gone from your heart amen hallelujah you know why fear is being unleashed on us right now it's just a greater portion because only the bride can get to a spot where they're not afraid of it amen you know putin's got some bombs with usa written all over it yep it's coming that's the seven vision american craters newt right let's get ready because i'll tell you what the holy ghost can be so strong you could be like john the revelator being a pot of seething oil i won't even phase you that's right until every sin of fear every son of god of doubt is gone from your heart and if you're there and god doesn't take you and omit your sins and send you into the presence of god there's something wrong with your experience amen all right where's jesus at let me look at him keep your eyes on jesus amen amen i ain't gonna have time for that i want us to see this very quickly remember christ is the mystery of god revealed that there's three manifestations that christ wanted to be known as if you fail come back to this one is what god in christ god in the holy ghost in his church then god in even condition to rule this church yes you have literally son of man son of god son of david so i'm just touching this because what i have told you is son of man that's prophet christ was the prophet he was the tabernacle that moved about that's right yes son of god is the holy ghost ministry that's now remember this is prophet priest and king that's right that's right amen son of god and then what pulling it out yet it's deep there's a lot there yes sir but notice that son of god yeah prophet priest okay who's who's our high priest christ he's a high priest yes now let's do this really quick here come a close when god built the temple how's it under jesse this when god built the temple he actually built it to be actually surrounded completely outside of the east gate by priestly chambers those priestly chambers as it says here the beans should not be fastened into the walls of the house let me show you the picture in just a second notice these priestly chambers out of the middle of june third there was actually three stories to these priestly chambers so he built the house finished it covered the house with beams and boards of caesars aside the temple god build priestly chambers to store all the goods for the house three stories the priests would watch they would lean upon the temple they said that that was a place of rest they would rest right against the temple of god they needed a rest is to head right to their station when they were in service they were in service when they rest they would go right there and rest by their courses justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost there's another picture of the cut out that right against leaning against the house was the priest chambers there's a good picture right there of course they line it up to a football field hallelujah americans hallelujah but notice you have prophet see the temple it was set to be a priestly move what which was facilitated mainly by the high priest himself but the move was for priests which is what you are you're a priest amen you see every focus of the type shows you that's right because you're a royal priesthood you're doing a holy priesthood offers spiritual sacrifices let's stand i gotta quit now i got time to do this but when god set that temple up the priest had to worship their duty was to worship that's right yeah that's why i'm back here right here i hear the voice is screaming i'm like oh glory to god hallelujah they did all the insurance let's just read that one so the priest said what and a stand every morning to thank and praise the lord and likewise at the evening do all the sacrifices the priests and all that the prophet priests okay the threefold mystery of god christ the mystery of god revealed see see what we see is that what christ is all of us christ truly is the temperament christ is what he's the temple yes hallelujah but now he lives inside of you that makes you the town amen amen and there's coming a millennial temple christ was over but it also manifests all three of his offices hallelujah prophet priest okay now you know you can go days and services on him working with those things i've heard your pastor priests quite a few mighty ones but coming to church one time preaching priesthood like oh lord of god he's like hallelujah in time i was like i was like those priests that were shouting in the morning shout at night shouting that's having a good time because the responsibility in the son of god ministry which you remember is a feast of feast of weeks to the feast of pentecost it's worship amen the temple was worshipped and we see originally when they worship the cloud come down that's right glory see how important your worship is yes hallelujah he didn't ask how good your voice was he asked do you worship that's right brother praise god what we say today i showed you about christ but it also identifies you that's right amen there's a lot more there we just scratched the surface and i hope i didn't wait because i tried to punch four services a lot of scriptures but the scripture is so beautiful and thank god we had a wise master builder that gave me amen i'm so happy about it when i see stuff like this i see the gentiles are bearing all the birds do all the hard work that thing amen thank god there's some 11th hour workers amen they didn't have to do the work as the people started then that's right they just had to do that last hour [Music] oh god let us go forward with all our hearts into the heart let's get ready let's do what we can amen hey man got me with you i know you guys got some works ahead of you a lot god's opening some doors and and uh god like you being beacons of light amen hallelujah that souls can be won to this rapture praise god to christ because that's the holy ghost praise god hallelujah it's not about making it's not just about making friends we're trying to get souls right and ready remember brother ramsay said when you get there he said you wonder why you didn't do more to get people in there oh god let me do all i can while i can hallelujah you are the temple of god indeed hallelujah and the double portion is yours are we going to do it where do we go from here just see what you're looking at are you looking at jesus or you're looking at this a lot of times we look way too much of this it's okay if you look at this and it's jesus that's right brother but the vast majority of time your bible has since lonely maybe youtube or something else got something better for you here right brother but they don't have anything better that's right that's right yes sir we're all in this together remember three out of four people are addicted to their cell phones you know except in message churches [Laughter] but let's not be so sarcastic with it it is an issue right brother we've got to get our full attention where everything is made to draw your attention away we've got to get our full attention on him because he has a double portion of christ amen amen how many want to say god and let this be our prayer tonight god i want to ask for a heart thing can you as an individual even now say god i want to ask for a hard thing i want a double portion of your spirit the double portion that the temple was to the tabernacle yeah i want a double portion so i can finish the work that you did and do greater works just more brother branham said he said what he said he used to think it was more he said but then christ did things only with that which was already there he said but when it came to speaking squirrels in existence god took it to a greater work where he could make it happen when there was nothing there you're made to materialize things that aren't even there can i look at you can i point at you you're made to materialize things that aren't there you're made to walk on fire you're made to move mountains jesus you're made for this oh god how could i do it every day what am i looking at lord let it be you tell your heart's prayer you say god i want a double portion of your spirit and i'm going to look at you help me to keep my eyes focused on you let's pray lord jesus oh god thank you for such a humble and loving people here in akron ohio jesus that love you with their hearts oh god they'll come and sit through long services they'll come and just hear the hearing of the word oh god just wanting faith to move mountains foreign we're asking as we see that the picture is playing we know what we've got to do in an hour that's this dark with this many distractions we've got to look at you soulless only and receive it to be happy with it to be excited about it you have to look at your neighbors y'all look at emails say god i want to look at you no matter what the trial i'm looking at you no matter what the outside looks like i'm looking at you oh yeah god sees your hearts he sees your hands he sees the love that you have for him hallelujah as we ask you lord just like elijah let a double portion be upon us lord we're not even familiar with that yet but we know that we were born for this type of movement [Music] let us look at you like that above all the temptations and challenge of the age may we look solely on you and your word [Music] we believe that you'll give it to us and great things are in store we ask you for it right now god let us get into that praise and worship condition let us get in that spot oh god when we see that we're made to be burned bearers in the precious name of jesus christ we accept it because you promised it and we believe it and we receive it in your holy name jesus christ we say so be it amen amen how do you invite our pastor up sing a song [Music] glory turn your eyes [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music]
