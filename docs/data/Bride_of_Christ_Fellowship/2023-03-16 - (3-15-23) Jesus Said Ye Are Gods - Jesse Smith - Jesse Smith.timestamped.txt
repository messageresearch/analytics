[0:03] 10 34.
[0:06] and we'll read 35 as well there Keisha
[0:09] thank you
[0:24] we live then hunt Okay thank you God
[0:26] bless our live streamers there's only a
[0:28] few but God bless you most of them will
[0:31] be watching on the archive
[0:33] but praise the Lord maybe Vang or Jose
[0:35] or some other ones or live streaming
[0:37] here tonight by God's grace
[0:39] John 10 34 and 35.
[0:43] now of course Jesus is being accused of
[0:45] blasphemy by making himself God
[0:48] of course we know the scripture here but
[0:50] verse 34 says Jesus answer them
[0:52] is it not written in your law I said ye
[0:55] are gods
[0:57] if he called them Gods unto whom the
[0:59] word of God came and the scripture
[1:02] cannot be broken say of him whom the
[1:05] father has Sanctified and sent into the
[1:07] world thou blasphemeth here's why
[1:09] because I said I am the son of God
[1:13] so the context of this scripture
[1:15] is that someone is calling themselves
[1:17] the son of God
[1:20] okay so look at the context Jesus is
[1:23] saying I am the son of God
[1:26] now let's go to Romans 8 19 and I'd like
[1:28] to also preach on this here by God's
[1:30] grace
[1:33] it was titled ye are Gods by a subtopic
[1:35] I like to look at the manifestation of
[1:37] the sons of God
[1:38] Romans 8 19.
[1:44] you might as well read verse 18. that's
[1:46] a beautiful verse there too I think
[1:47] it'll encourage us here tonight by the
[1:49] grace of God
[1:51] as I was preaching on Sunday and if
[1:52] you've heard it before if you ever need
[1:53] an encouraging chapter Romans 8 is the
[1:56] chapter to read praise God starts off
[1:57] with there's no condemnation It Ends by
[1:59] saying nothing could say separate you
[2:01] from God's love Hallelujah
[2:04] I could just read that and we could all
[2:06] go home right we'd all be happy I don't
[2:08] have any condemnation nobody can take
[2:09] Jesus the love away from me right you
[2:11] could all leave and be happy but we'll
[2:14] preach a little more by God's grace
[2:15] Romans 8 9 18. for I reckon that the
[2:18] sufferings of this present time think of
[2:20] your sufferings that we go through
[2:22] are not worthy to be compared with the
[2:25] glory which shall be revealed in US
[2:29] now let's read verse 19. one two three
[2:31] for the earnest expectation of the
[2:35] creature wadeth for the manifestation of
[2:39] the sons of God okay so we're speaking
[2:42] of a time when the glory will be
[2:43] revealed in us a future time
[2:46] all right
[2:48] if you have any need on your heart here
[2:49] let's raise it unto God let's have one
[2:50] more word of prayer for us third time we
[2:52] pray father God I Want to Thank You Lord
[2:53] we never pray enough Lord teachers we
[2:56] come to the portion of the word of God
[2:57] lord I've read your word I pray you just
[2:59] anoint me and father anoint your people
[3:01] to receive it
[3:02] and God we thank you for all your
[3:04] blessings we know we were we were born
[3:06] for such a time as this as Esther said
[3:08] Lord God here in 2023 Lord God we see
[3:11] the world and tumultuous conditions
[3:15] chaos all around but Lord yet we have
[3:18] stability in Christ Hallelujah we are
[3:20] loved nothing accelerate separate us
[3:22] from your love dear God we have peace
[3:25] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[3:26] we want to thank you for that
[3:28] and Lord yet we come to you Lord with
[3:30] these needs father I pray God you
[3:31] ministered each of the needs in Jesus
[3:33] Christ's name and the saint said amen
[3:36] God bless you as you're being seated
[3:37] praise God
[3:41] let's have a few slides I didn't get
[3:43] maybe all the slides done I like to do
[3:45] this you know when I started studying it
[3:47] this morning I thought well this would
[3:48] be a shorter subject maybe easier to
[3:50] study through but then I as I studied I
[3:52] I was I was surprised there was a little
[3:54] bit more than I thought so we'll get as
[3:56] far as we can here by God's grace
[4:00] so I want to start with this thought on
[4:02] ye are Gods here out of uh John chapter
[4:04] 10. so if you have your Bible let's head
[4:06] back there to John chapter 10.
[4:11] and I think the
[4:13] maybe the controversy with this is that
[4:15] you know some people will
[4:18] will actually declare we are gods
[4:21] and
[4:23] if someone's never heard that before
[4:25] they would initially think these people
[4:28] are deifying themselves
[4:31] right
[4:32] if you I mean how many people do you
[4:33] know that walk around and say well I'm a
[4:35] little God
[4:36] I'm I'm one of the Gods I mean I would
[4:39] think I would probably say you're crazy
[4:40] if somebody said that
[4:42] you belong in the insane institution and
[4:44] I'll go check you in uh
[4:48] but you know uh I was as I was studying
[4:50] this I was a I was very surprised that
[4:52] there's a couple of scriptures in the
[4:54] Old Testament that do call
[4:55] God's people gods there's actually a
[4:58] couple places
[5:00] um so we got to understand it and what
[5:02] we'll understand is that the word
[5:03] lowercase Gods now this should be a
[5:05] lowercase D so I do apologize I didn't
[5:07] think about that I was just thinking of
[5:08] titles you know you capitalize I
[5:09] actually taught that lesson today at
[5:10] school you have to capitalize the title
[5:12] so maybe that's why
[5:15] either way I think the kids got it but
[5:18] either way
[5:20] it's lowercase gods and the point is
[5:23] that this word God is the Hebrew word is
[5:25] Elohim right of course it means the
[5:28] Creator God the Eternal God but there
[5:31] are some definitions of that word uh
[5:34] that just mean judge or representative
[5:37] or Godlike
[5:40] it also can mean Angel I'll show there's
[5:43] lots of definitions for the word Elohim
[5:46] okay so uh so for us when Jesus would
[5:50] say you know ye are Gods whom the word
[5:52] of God would come to Jesus saying uh ye
[5:55] are Judges or you are representatives of
[5:57] God because the word of God comes to you
[6:00] the best word in the New Testament is
[6:02] the word ambassador
[6:04] so let's turn there while it's on my
[6:06] mind here so I don't forget I want to
[6:07] make sure I lay this in here second
[6:09] Corinthians five if you've got your
[6:10] Bibles here
[6:11] second Corinthians 5. let's lay this in
[6:12] here
[6:14] you are an ambassador for Jesus Christ
[6:17] that means you stand in the place of him
[6:21] you are bringing his message
[6:23] second Corinthians 5.
[6:27] and your message is reconciliation so we
[6:30] should look for opportunities Church in
[6:32] our lives
[6:33] to find people that would like to be
[6:35] reconciled to God
[6:37] most people were going to come in
[6:38] contact with are not reconciled to God
[6:41] they're distant from God
[6:42] their lives speak nothing of Holiness
[6:45] their lives speak nothing of Victory
[6:47] their lives don't speak of the Holy
[6:49] Ghost they speak of the Unholy spirit
[6:51] right the spirit of the world or the
[6:53] Antichrist Spirit even and so we have to
[6:55] look for opportunities and pray for
[6:56] opportunities God send us someone who is
[6:59] hungry for the word of God send us
[7:01] someone who wants to have peace with you
[7:03] praise God
[7:04] send someone who wants to be reconciled
[7:06] to God hallelujah
[7:12] so verse 17 just a very familiar
[7:16] scripture here on you know of course we
[7:17] love this verse therefore If any man be
[7:19] in Christ he's a new creature how many
[7:20] new creatures we have here tonight
[7:22] I'm a yeah I'm a brand new person
[7:24] because of Christ
[7:25] Hallelujah old things are passed away
[7:28] behold all things are become new and all
[7:31] things are of God who hath reconciled us
[7:33] to himself by Jesus Christ so God
[7:37] thought what tool can I use to get
[7:39] Austin reconciled to me
[7:41] what what can I use to get Jesse
[7:43] reconciled to me he's a sinner he's he's
[7:46] dead in sins and he says I'll use my son
[7:48] Jesus Hallelujah
[7:50] so Jesus God becoming flesh
[7:53] a sacrifice God giving us a holy
[7:55] sacrifice the death of that sacrifice
[7:57] reconciled me back to God
[8:00] Hallelujah that sacrifice God thought
[8:03] what what could what could I do to to
[8:05] bring peace between a sinner and me what
[8:08] could I what could I do to bring unity
[8:10] and Reconciliation I'll use a sacrifice
[8:13] and so that's what God did God sent his
[8:15] son Jesus Christ and through our faith
[8:17] through the faith God gives us in Christ
[8:19] we're reconciled to God we're no longer
[8:21] fighting against God
[8:23] hallelujah we're fighting for God and
[8:26] God's fighting for us amen
[8:29] Hallelujah it may not be like it at
[8:30] times church but God is fighting for you
[8:32] the Bible says if God before us who can
[8:35] be against us praise God hallelujah God
[8:38] is fighting on your side amen God is
[8:41] fighting on your behalf praise God
[8:43] oh it's a great lesson it's a great
[8:45] reminder that we need
[8:48] and finishing Verse 18 has given to us
[8:50] the ministry of reconciliation so that's
[8:53] what we should do we should look to our
[8:54] friends
[8:55] and look for opportunities to reconcile
[8:58] them to God
[8:59] praise the Lord
[9:00] you know as I was preaching on Sunday I
[9:02] started preaching on cigarettes and and
[9:04] uh being married two or three times and
[9:07] then after the second service these two
[9:08] guys walk up to me and that's exactly
[9:10] what they were struggling with I didn't
[9:11] even know it and I had to I instruct
[9:14] them I said here's how I overcame to
[9:16] tobacco
[9:17] here's how I overcame these things what
[9:19] was I trying to do I'm trying to
[9:21] reconcile them to God
[9:23] I tell the brother you know don't marry
[9:24] again you've already been married once
[9:26] you've been living with another woman
[9:27] don't marry another woman don't do that
[9:31] now if they do they can still come to
[9:32] church like Billy Paul Branham right but
[9:34] there's no guarantees they're going to
[9:36] the rapture
[9:37] they're actually taking a big risk not
[9:39] to go in the rapture
[9:40] because the Bible said adulterers will
[9:42] not inherit the kingdom of God
[9:45] now of course we know they can be
[9:46] forgiven if they repent
[9:48] but it's very touchy situation it's a
[9:51] it's a very uh
[9:54] it's just not a very it's just it's a
[9:56] it's just an uncertain thing to do to
[9:58] purposely go against God's word right
[10:01] and break God's commands and then just
[10:04] hope for mercy
[10:06] that's a very dangerous thing to do we
[10:08] would just I would just say it's not a
[10:10] wise thing to do right right
[10:12] but that was that was the ministry even
[10:14] after service I like that even after
[10:15] preaching I still got to preach I still
[10:16] got to minister even after the church
[10:19] that's how it should be
[10:20] you know even after we Minister here we
[10:22] might Minister out there
[10:24] we got to be ready at all times so
[10:25] remember that our ministry is
[10:28] reconciling others to God
[10:30] how can I help my brother get reconciled
[10:33] to God how can I help my sister feel
[10:35] peace with God
[10:36] what can I do what can I say to bring
[10:39] peace with God the main thing is get rid
[10:40] of the sin question praise God
[10:42] because that's what we all battle you
[10:43] know I saved did God even loved me is
[10:46] God fighting against me
[10:48] and we can very easily solve that by
[10:50] pointing you to the word of God
[10:51] hallelujah Romans chapter 8 as I said
[10:54] amen and Romans 5 1 now we have peace
[10:57] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[10:59] Hallelujah
[11:01] we just must repent of our sins and then
[11:02] the greatest battle ever fought has been
[11:04] won temporarily but the battle is going
[11:07] to come back amen
[11:09] but how many are ready to keep fighting
[11:11] praise God
[11:12] that's how Satan went you know Satan uh
[11:14] discourages people it's through the test
[11:16] of time
[11:18] right we'll go through some heavy
[11:19] battles we'll go through seasons of hard
[11:21] battles tough mind battles and then
[11:23] we'll get and then we'll get Victory and
[11:25] then it seems like just a few days later
[11:26] right then we got to start over mind
[11:28] battles again and then our backs kind of
[11:30] hunch like this again
[11:32] I gotta renew my mind again and we got
[11:35] we gotta say God give me some strength
[11:36] to raise those shoulders back praise God
[11:38] brother Brandon said that's what faith
[11:39] does faith throws his shoulders back and
[11:42] says I've got big must I've got big
[11:44] muscles of Faith praise God
[11:46] Hallelujah so we have to have an
[11:49] attitude of okay I know I'm going to go
[11:51] through Cycles I got to be willing to
[11:52] fight this again I can't get lazy come
[11:54] on church I can't get plate complacent
[11:56] on God I got to be willing to have a
[11:58] renewed mind I got to be willing to
[12:00] fight some more praise God
[12:02] Hallelujah I've got to get my mind right
[12:04] I got to get my mind back in fighting
[12:06] mode praise God
[12:09] not a pushover mode
[12:11] right and same thing for me I'm
[12:13] preaching to myself Amen brother Jesse
[12:15] or I should say Amen holy spirit because
[12:17] I'm no preacher that's about you Cam
[12:19] said great preacher I said brother
[12:20] Cameron I said you know there's no
[12:21] preacher but Jesus if anybody if anybody
[12:23] was blessed it was because Jesus was
[12:24] preaching praise God hallelujah
[12:28] ah
[12:30] so we see the ministry of reconciliation
[12:34] now
[12:35] now here's how he did verse 19 to win
[12:37] that is that means that is that is God
[12:40] was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[12:42] himself not imputing their trespasses
[12:44] unto them how many can say praise the
[12:46] Lord
[12:46] God's not going to impute your
[12:48] trespasses to you
[12:50] because Christ already paid for them
[12:53] that ought to make somebody happy
[12:54] tonight praise God somebody I'll leave
[12:56] here happy it's going to be me I know
[12:58] that's for sure join me
[13:00] Hallelujah let the word of God make us
[13:02] happy
[13:03] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[13:05] in other words we won't get punished for
[13:06] what we've done
[13:08] Hallelujah and hath committed unto us
[13:11] the word of reconciliation so that's
[13:13] what we should say Lord give me a word
[13:15] so somebody can be reconciled to God
[13:18] we know fewer and fewer will find it as
[13:20] time goes on uh Jesus said the the days
[13:23] have to be shortened so that some people
[13:25] are saved right if it went on nobody
[13:28] would even be saved so the days have to
[13:30] be short just to make sure people are
[13:32] saved
[13:35] now verse 20. now then we are
[13:39] ambassadors for Christ now that's the
[13:40] word their ambassadors
[13:43] okay we are standing in the place of
[13:46] Christ
[13:47] now we don't compare anything to him
[13:49] because we have no strength but his
[13:51] Spirit does anoint us amen
[13:54] we say through temporary times in our
[13:56] soul if we're born again it permanently
[13:58] anoints us but we're constantly fighting
[14:00] the battle of the Mind
[14:02] and we have to be humble and say you
[14:04] know uh
[14:05] like Jesus he did so many miracles you
[14:08] couldn't fill this room with books about
[14:09] him
[14:10] now your life my life you could probably
[14:13] build this could probably feel fill a
[14:15] Shelf with your testimonies right
[14:17] mine too right I could tell the stories
[14:19] and try to remember as many details I
[14:21] fit in a book yeah maybe two books
[14:24] depends how long the book is
[14:26] but you know we realize we are not the
[14:29] fullness of God Christ was a fullness of
[14:31] God
[14:32] he had the Holy Ghost without measure
[14:34] we've got it with measure but let's use
[14:36] all the measure that we got praise God
[14:38] Amen that's our prayer tonight God
[14:40] anointing the measure tonight so
[14:42] something can be accomplished tonight
[14:43] praise God
[14:45] whether it's strength or whether it's
[14:46] encouragement or repentance or Victory
[14:48] or healing Whatever It Is God anoint my
[14:50] measure tonight praise God use my
[14:53] measure tonight so God God can be
[14:55] glorified so somebody can be reconciled
[14:57] to God Amen
[14:59] they feel estranged from God they could
[15:01] be reconciled to God
[15:03] like that one sister after service you
[15:04] know we're just talking and she said
[15:06] brother Jesse I want to really
[15:07] appreciate you for that sermon she's
[15:08] like you are inside of my head and your
[15:10] whole sermon was like everything I've
[15:12] been thinking over the last few battles
[15:15] I said well I wasn't in your head I
[15:17] didn't think about you all week it was
[15:19] God that thought about you all week
[15:21] I haven't thought about you for a long
[15:22] time actually
[15:24] how did I get inside her head it wasn't
[15:26] me it was Jesus praise God because he's
[15:29] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[15:31] of the heart she was one weeping during
[15:32] the service and just praising God and
[15:34] thanking the lord for the encouragement
[15:36] that's brought so that's what we're to
[15:38] do we're supposed to use to reconcile
[15:40] people back to God
[15:42] Hallelujah
[15:44] now ambassador
[15:46] now actually I didn't look that up here
[15:48] recently let me just look it up real
[15:49] quick it should take like five seconds
[15:52] here so five
[15:54] four three
[15:56] two
[15:57] one okay
[16:00] here it is all right so Ambassador in
[16:02] the Greek means
[16:03] to be a senior that is a representative
[16:06] an ambassador so a representative right
[16:08] I'm a representative of Copley Fairlawn
[16:11] schools right our our children there are
[16:14] the school children our representatives
[16:16] of Coventry elementary school right
[16:20] Hallelujah
[16:21] your representatives of Smith Academy
[16:25] is that what they call
[16:27] you know wherever you work you're
[16:28] representative of your work
[16:31] and so we are representatives of Heaven
[16:33] praise God
[16:35] hallelujah we're Representatives because
[16:37] Jesus said pray let thy will be done on
[16:40] Earth as it is in heaven praise God let
[16:43] it be done on Earth just like God's will
[16:45] like God wants it in heaven
[16:47] God sent us here in our church we always
[16:49] don't always do a great job of it but
[16:51] there are times people can see we're
[16:53] from Heaven praise God Amen there are
[16:56] times people can see there's a
[16:57] difference about you something's
[16:58] different about you God use you and God
[17:00] used you for reconciliation thank God
[17:02] amen hallelujah thank God for those
[17:05] opportunities
[17:06] we're sent to represent Jesus Christ
[17:09] we're set to represent the god of Heaven
[17:11] praise God I'm thankful for it amen I
[17:13] don't want to represent hell
[17:15] ought to represent Heaven Hallelujah
[17:17] that there's hope in heaven there's
[17:19] victory in heaven there's peace in
[17:21] heaven there's joy in heaven there's
[17:23] eternal life in heaven amen and I'm a
[17:25] representative of that
[17:27] thank God thank you Jesus
[17:30] verse 21 there's one of the best verses
[17:32] you ever want to memorize
[17:34] for he God has made Christ to be sin for
[17:38] us
[17:39] who knew no sin
[17:41] that we might be made the righteousness
[17:43] of God in him
[17:45] we get Jesus's righteousness and he took
[17:49] our unrighteousness
[17:51] what a beautiful Divine exchange as
[17:53] we've said hallelujah what a great
[17:55] scripture so now just so you know this
[17:57] is my understanding
[18:00] if someone would say well you know
[18:02] brother so-and-so or sister and so but
[18:03] Jesus said you're Gods I would say yes
[18:06] but I don't like to use that word very
[18:09] much
[18:10] and you know why I don't like them give
[18:11] a good reason
[18:12] I'm going to give you a real good reason
[18:14] here because in the New Testament Paul
[18:16] never calls us gods
[18:19] right and Paul said we'll be judged by
[18:21] his gospel
[18:23] okay
[18:25] and again
[18:27] the more someone walks around saying
[18:29] they're a God if they don't show me some
[18:30] God in them I'm not going to believe
[18:32] them I'm going to think they're crazy I
[18:34] better be seeing you doing Supernatural
[18:35] things right casting out Devils Healing
[18:38] The Sick speaking in tongues
[18:39] interpreting prophesying I've ever seen
[18:41] a lot of that you walk around calling
[18:42] yourself a god
[18:44] so to me out of respect and humility I
[18:47] don't like to use the word God's that's
[18:48] why you never heard me preach a sermon
[18:50] on God's before Rachel have you ever
[18:51] heard me preach a sermon on gods I'll be
[18:53] really shocked if my hand goes up
[18:54] because I don't remember ever preaching
[18:56] a sermon on God's because I never have
[18:58] because I've never been I've never been
[19:00] comfortable with that type of language
[19:01] because you don't I just don't see in
[19:03] the New Testament very often
[19:04] now I know what the Bible says I'm going
[19:06] to show you what the Bible says and so I
[19:08] can go with it you know where the Bible
[19:09] says it but I don't want to Major on
[19:11] that and call myself a God because you
[19:13] hang around alone you're going to find
[19:14] out I'm really human as you know I'm
[19:17] really human
[19:18] right I don't so resemble so much of God
[19:23] and whatever reason whatever reason the
[19:26] King James version translators
[19:28] translated that as gods because it
[19:30] either means a judge or like God now
[19:33] Church in one way you are like God
[19:35] because you're in the image of God
[19:39] amen right you have a mind you can speak
[19:41] you can build
[19:43] right you can do things you can create
[19:45] things now create really you don't
[19:47] really create it right you
[19:50] you don't really create anything right
[19:52] we say create an atmosphere but really
[19:53] not the really one creating it like it's
[19:55] the holy spirit that does it right like
[19:57] we just yield to the Holy Spirit to
[20:00] create an atmosphere so my reasoning
[20:02] behind this that not using the gods so
[20:04] much is because I want to remain humble
[20:06] right and I don't see Paul you know
[20:09] saying well call yourself Gods uh he
[20:11] doesn't write a letter you know peace
[20:12] from God our Father to all the gods that
[20:14] are at laodicea like we don't we just we
[20:16] don't read that in the Bible
[20:18] you know oh to all the gods that are in
[20:20] the city of Corinth or the in colossae
[20:22] like you don't see Paul using that he
[20:25] calls them saints amen hallelujah that's
[20:27] what I believe I got here tonight
[20:28] there's Saints here tonight
[20:30] there's ones that are separated for
[20:32] God's purpose your ambassadors your
[20:34] God's Representatives you're trying to
[20:36] reconcile people to God Amen
[20:39] okay
[20:40] so I hope that's kind of like my
[20:42] introduction there and nobody can say
[20:43] well brother Jesse preached a sermon he
[20:45] already preached before I've never
[20:46] preached this here before so
[20:48] I know you never say that but people
[20:50] online or whatever they
[20:51] I've never preached on this before now
[20:53] here's here's our text here Jesus says
[20:56] uh you know they're getting they're
[20:57] upset with them saying Oh you blasphemed
[21:00] he said doesn't even your law your law
[21:02] say you are gods
[21:05] and now why do they call them Gods
[21:06] because the word of God came to them
[21:09] right
[21:11] and then when Jesus interprets this he
[21:13] says I'm the son of God
[21:15] this is his interpretation
[21:18] now I don't know if he knew this but
[21:19] Jesus was actually quoting psalm 82.
[21:23] so you don't have to have your Bibles
[21:24] there like I said I'm not sure how long
[21:25] this is going to be
[21:27] I forgot to set my timer so let me do 30
[21:29] minutes because I've already got 15
[21:30] minutes in
[21:31] now uh
[21:33] Psalm 82 1-2 a Psalm of asaph
[21:36] God standing in the congregation of the
[21:38] mighty he judgeth among the gods and
[21:43] this is Old Testament
[21:45] hallelujah how long will you judge
[21:47] unjustly now look he calls him unjust
[21:49] judges and except the persons of the
[21:51] wicked say Lao which means meditate on
[21:53] that
[21:55] and that's something
[21:57] no if you just go not skip verses three
[21:59] through five go to verse six I have said
[22:01] ye are gods and all of you are children
[22:04] look at this of the most high
[22:06] so do we have scripture where All God's
[22:08] Children Are Gods yes we have scripture
[22:10] on that but not a lot of them
[22:12] just a couple
[22:14] okay
[22:16] now look
[22:17] he calls him Gods but then he says but
[22:20] ye shall die like men so of course
[22:22] Israel must be in some type of state of
[22:24] rebellion here
[22:25] and fall like one of the princes he said
[22:27] your Gods but you're going to fall like
[22:29] princes
[22:30] arise oh God now here's the real God
[22:32] right that's the real God right there
[22:34] arise oh God judge the Earth for Thou
[22:37] shalt inherit All Nations what's that
[22:39] speaking of the millennium
[22:41] okay
[22:44] so see all the children of God are
[22:46] called gods
[22:48] okay
[22:49] in a few places
[22:52] but again I don't recommend you walk
[22:54] around saying I'm hey I'm a God
[22:58] I'm a God Jesus said I'm a God I want to
[23:01] walk around saying that that's
[23:03] uh
[23:04] Jesus did you know we don't see Paul
[23:06] telling us to do that
[23:08] you know because pride gets in there let
[23:10] me share this here I've listened to a
[23:12] lot of message preachers I love most
[23:13] they're preaching but they're really
[23:15] majoring on these quotes where brother
[23:16] Braham says she is him there's actual
[23:17] quote where brother man said the bride
[23:19] is Christ
[23:20] she is him
[23:23] in church that's getting close to
[23:24] idolatry like
[23:26] you know they're making they're making
[23:27] us equal to Christ now in one way we
[23:29] have the spirit of Christ but we don't
[23:31] make ourselves completely equal because
[23:33] we don't have the fullness of the
[23:34] godhead bodily
[23:36] and they major and these are the same
[23:38] people again that are calling themselves
[23:39] the greatest of all time I know you've
[23:40] sat through it heard me preach many
[23:42] sermons on doctrines of devils and I
[23:43] appreciate your love and your compassion
[23:45] I do appreciate that I hope you I know
[23:47] you enjoyed them I know nature enjoyed
[23:48] them she said they were the best sermons
[23:49] you ever heard that might have changed
[23:52] since then but that really encouraged me
[23:55] but the point is the same people that
[23:57] are calling themselves the greatest are
[23:58] now they're just quick quick to say
[24:00] you're the we're the message they're
[24:01] saying and we are him we are him well
[24:04] you're representatives of him
[24:08] you're anointed by him but not always
[24:12] now the trouble is they act like they're
[24:15] always anointed when they're not let me
[24:16] give you two simple examples let me
[24:17] remind you of two we're coming up on the
[24:19] one year anniversary of a famous message
[24:21] preacher who has tremendous Miracles
[24:22] tremendous testimonies but he said we're
[24:24] just hours away from the Rapture because
[24:26] of the war in Ukraine
[24:28] we're coming up on a year that's a lot
[24:30] of hours
[24:31] in 365 days
[24:35] and then the week later he said we're
[24:36] just days away from the Rapture now here
[24:38] we are now look here we are a year later
[24:40] is anyone holding him accountable no
[24:41] they're just still loving him and no
[24:43] one's no one's trying to correct him
[24:45] so see
[24:46] when you get to that spot I'm the
[24:48] greatest of all time you're not afraid
[24:49] to just say whatever you want and then
[24:51] nobody checks up on you because they got
[24:52] the same Spirit you got Pride
[24:54] it's a prideful spirit
[24:57] right but doesn't the Bible say prove
[24:59] all things as they prove some things or
[25:00] prove all things prove all things
[25:03] so see you just you got to watch it
[25:06] and Churchill if you got the Holy Spirit
[25:08] you'll start Discerning these things too
[25:10] right you'll start watching like I
[25:11] remember when sister Naomi told us about
[25:13] how uh people gifted a pastor like a
[25:16] Mercedes-Benz or whatever car it was
[25:19] now Church
[25:21] people ought to know something's wrong
[25:22] with that that would have fly up red
[25:24] flags amen right when the nation's full
[25:27] of poor people or whatever
[25:29] that ought to float float some red flags
[25:31] and
[25:32] that doesn't seem very humble
[25:34] doesn't seem like Christ was Christ
[25:36] riding around in a Mercedes-Benz or for
[25:39] that day would have been a horse and
[25:40] buggy or like a gold horse and buggy
[25:42] like Solomon did
[25:44] no Christ was humble
[25:46] and nobody was better than Christ
[25:50] but see you just you start watching and
[25:52] here's the more red flags you see the
[25:53] more you okay watch these people
[25:55] just like with that Pastor that left at
[25:57] uh a Lima a number of years ago Jeff
[25:59] Jenkins well he let them cut their hair
[26:01] the whole time you let them wear makeup
[26:02] the whole time
[26:03] uh he taught wrong on the baptism of the
[26:05] Holy Ghost I mean he made fun of brother
[26:06] Brooks for the way he worshiped and uh
[26:09] and they were too emotional he said
[26:11] they're too emotional I had I had like
[26:13] seven or eight things doctrines he was
[26:14] wrong on so it was no surprise when he
[26:17] left a message
[26:18] right but you got to watch him the Bible
[26:19] said Mark them that caused divisions
[26:22] praise God contrary to the doctrine that
[26:24] you've heard
[26:26] I don't know how I got to all know that
[26:27] but anyways
[26:28] I guess God knows anyways we don't want
[26:30] to walk around saying I'm God and I am
[26:33] him
[26:34] you're an ambassador for him
[26:36] if you're an ambassador
[26:38] for the White House you don't go around
[26:40] saying well I'm Joe Biden
[26:42] no you no you say I'm a representative
[26:45] of the White House
[26:47] right right
[26:49] that's what a representative do
[26:50] represent representative doesn't steal
[26:52] somebody's personality
[26:54] that's what these message people are
[26:55] doing trying to but then they don't even
[26:57] act like Jesus
[26:58] they're not humble like Jesus
[27:01] right and then they pronounce people are
[27:03] going to be healed and then they die
[27:04] that's not what Jesus did
[27:08] see they get so prideful and lifted up
[27:10] well I'm a God and I'm gonna they are
[27:11] these sermons I'm anointed I'm a messiah
[27:13] I'm a crater well sometimes you are but
[27:16] not all the time
[27:18] and I'm not trying to discourage us from
[27:19] having faith I want you to have faith
[27:21] but if God's in it God's going to move
[27:23] praise God
[27:26] and church and if we say something don't
[27:27] come to pass we just got to apologize
[27:29] praise God
[27:30] and my and make it right
[27:35] you are God's
[27:37] okay now here's the here's what I was
[27:39] talking about the word Gods is Elohim
[27:41] and of course that's the word for God
[27:42] this is the word for Lord
[27:44] now see some of the the only definition
[27:46] that makes sense here in in the children
[27:49] of God you are Gods is your rulers or
[27:51] judges
[27:52] that's the only one now you can say
[27:54] Divine ones as far as uh the anointings
[27:56] in your mind you know you have the
[27:58] Divine Holy Spirit in your mind or now
[28:00] in the New Testament now it's in your
[28:01] soul
[28:03] you can make a you can make a case for
[28:04] that
[28:07] but you can't make a case in the New
[28:09] Testament for people walk around saying
[28:10] I'm God I'm one of the Gods
[28:13] you just can't make that you can't make
[28:14] that where Paul says I'm in prayers
[28:17] often I'm fasting often I'm hungry often
[28:20] I'm in beatings often well where if he
[28:22] was such a God why wasn't he just
[28:23] knocking down the prison walls or
[28:25] whatever breaking the chains well I'm a
[28:27] God I'll just walk right out of here you
[28:28] know no he can only do that when the
[28:30] angel was there
[28:31] so we don't want to get this Spirit of
[28:34] pride
[28:35] and arrogance that comes with false
[28:37] teaching
[28:39] that's why I haven't preached it for
[28:41] 17 years I've been Pastor actually 19
[28:43] years I've been preaching I haven't
[28:44] reaching her in 19 years until tonight
[28:46] almost 20 years of reaching I've never I
[28:48] just never touched a subject
[28:50] because I knew what went along with it
[28:53] now here's a different concordance I
[28:55] don't know I guess there must be two
[28:56] strong concordance I'd like to look at
[28:58] that one out in the brother Stephen gave
[28:59] us out there I never looked at that one
[29:01] but anyways this is a really good one
[29:02] here's what it says Elohim
[29:05] it can be plural right can be plural
[29:08] God's in an ordinary sense so like false
[29:11] gods
[29:12] now here's where it is occasionally this
[29:14] word is applied by the way of deference
[29:17] to magistrates or judges or rulers again
[29:21] so someone with a lot of authority they
[29:23] would call him a Elohim
[29:26] right but we would pray o Elohim we
[29:28] worship you
[29:29] remember all those names I can't
[29:31] remember all of them I've reached a long
[29:33] time ago
[29:35] Elohim
[29:37] all the seven compound Redemptive names
[29:39] of Christ amen
[29:41] but Elohim is occasionally now
[29:45] this word Elohim has used over 2600
[29:47] times
[29:49] and only a few are applied to men or
[29:52] children of God men are women
[29:54] okay
[29:56] so just so you know
[29:58] so this word sometimes and look it's
[29:59] used for angels too as we said it's used
[30:01] for Angels
[30:02] judges Mighty people right Mighty Men
[30:05] got mighty men and women out there
[30:06] praise God
[30:08] Paul said the the gospel Works in me
[30:11] mightily praise God
[30:13] that's what he said the gospel worked in
[30:16] Paul mightily Hallelujah
[30:21] now here's another one you remember this
[30:22] one
[30:23] Saul's last second last day on Earth
[30:26] he went to the witch of Endor
[30:28] and he said can you call them up and he
[30:30] called him up she called him up
[30:32] the king senator be not afraid for what
[30:33] saw us down the woman said I saw I saw
[30:36] God's ascending up out of the Earth in
[30:38] other words rulers
[30:40] magistrates Prophets
[30:42] not only did Samuel come up somebody
[30:44] else came up out of there
[30:45] I wonder who it was he only called for
[30:48] Samuel but more than one came up I can't
[30:50] explain that other than the blood of
[30:51] Jesus Christ wasn't shed yet like
[30:52] brother Brown said
[30:54] and they had access somehow that that
[30:57] witch had access to souls because there
[30:59] was no blood to cover them over they had
[31:00] animal blood that's all I can say
[31:02] I know I get a good question on that on
[31:04] Sunday I'm sure Sunday night I'll get a
[31:06] real good question about that so the off
[31:07] study up this week okay
[31:09] probably gonna come from Haven or nature
[31:11] one of those smart people out there
[31:13] you are smart very yeah Simon and cam
[31:16] were really impressed by all the
[31:17] questions children
[31:18] yeah we're really impressed like Barbara
[31:20] Jess you got some hard questions I know
[31:21] tell me about it
[31:23] most ready to ask for a vacation
[31:28] and here's another one you'd be familiar
[31:29] with and the Lord said unto Moses see I
[31:31] have made thee a God to pharaoh
[31:35] he didn't make him a co-equal person
[31:38] that'd be good for the trinitarians
[31:41] he made him a ruler or judge to pharaoh
[31:44] or he made him one like God in other
[31:46] words God gives you the word right and
[31:48] the word is backed up like anything God
[31:50] says God's Gonna back up
[31:52] so Moses became God he got the word he
[31:54] gave it to Aaron and Aaron gave it to
[31:56] pharaoh
[31:57] in other words he had thus saith the
[31:58] Lord he had power in his word so he was
[32:00] Godlike
[32:02] doesn't mean Moses was perfect
[32:06] right because not long after this he
[32:08] struck the rock said you bunch of rebels
[32:10] look at me and God said you met you
[32:11] glorified yourself
[32:17] now based upon this
[32:19] here's here's what I'm trying to say
[32:21] Jesus use this verse to say I am the Son
[32:23] of God so we can use that verse to say
[32:25] I'm a Son of God or or I'm a daughter of
[32:29] God and the church said
[32:31] it's okay to say that it's okay I'm a
[32:33] daughter of God
[32:35] God's my father
[32:38] I'm a son of God
[32:40] but I'm not saying I'm the son of God
[32:43] that's blasphemy
[32:45] right but if I just said
[32:47] I am a Son of God and not brother also
[32:50] and not in the future I'm going to be a
[32:51] Son of God I already am a son of God
[32:53] because John said behold what manner of
[32:56] love look at this what manner of love
[32:58] has God bestowed upon us that we should
[33:00] be called the sons of God
[33:02] therefore the world knows us not because
[33:04] it knew him now that's why nobody wants
[33:06] that's why the Sinners don't like
[33:07] talking to you they don't like being
[33:08] around you they don't even know who you
[33:09] are
[33:10] they can't even begin to understand who
[33:13] you are
[33:15] and sometimes I like being alone of the
[33:17] world so I don't mind being involved by
[33:18] myself out in the world because I don't
[33:19] want to be bothered with their
[33:20] wickedness
[33:22] beloved now so I'll tell them like
[33:24] brother Austin there right now
[33:27] Austin you are now a son of God but amen
[33:30] now you are a son of God I'll call all
[33:33] the men out tonight Malachi's almost a
[33:35] man Malachi now you're the son of God
[33:39] and it does not appear what we shall be
[33:42] like we can't see the the glorified body
[33:44] but we know that when he shall appear we
[33:48] shall be like him for we shall see him
[33:50] as he is amen
[33:52] as soon as we'll see him we'll have a
[33:54] body just like him amen
[33:56] now I'm a son of God
[33:59] am I perfect no
[34:02] but I know my father's still proud of me
[34:04] amen praise God because I've got peace
[34:07] with God Amen
[34:08] he's forgiving me
[34:11] right he can't love me any less
[34:14] yes he has to spank me I said chasing me
[34:16] has to correct me yes rebuke me but that
[34:19] doesn't mean he doesn't love me praise
[34:20] God that actually proves he does love me
[34:22] Hallelujah
[34:23] so see the very best we can say
[34:27] if someone said well brother Jess or
[34:29] brother amen Jesus said you're Gods I
[34:31] would say well I would say I'm a son of
[34:33] God
[34:35] I'm not going to walk around and said
[34:36] I'm one of the Gods
[34:38] now you're getting the video game kind
[34:39] of movie kind of stuff you know the war
[34:42] of the Gods
[34:47] that's I personally I just you know for
[34:49] me I'd rather refrain from using that
[34:50] word I'd rather use Ambassador or I'm a
[34:53] server I'd rather I say that I'm a
[34:54] servant of God
[34:56] I'm a Son of God I'm one of his sons one
[34:58] of the many sons
[35:00] and I'm the least of the least but I'm
[35:01] one of them praise God
[35:04] I know Brian kept saying that he's like
[35:06] brother he's I'm just the Lisa Lisa I
[35:07] said well you're wrong on that I am
[35:09] you're wrong
[35:10] I'll have to tell them that tonight
[35:12] he kept saying that I'm Elisa Lisa I
[35:14] said no sir you're wrong I I call that
[35:16] first
[35:17] now here's the only time
[35:19] that a believer's call to God in the New
[35:22] Testament look it up I challenge you
[35:23] look it up I looked up today
[35:26] you remember the story
[35:29] Pawn uh Barnabas do this amazing Miracle
[35:32] right
[35:34] the people saw what they done they lift
[35:36] up their voices and they said the gods
[35:38] are come down to us in the likeness of
[35:39] men
[35:41] your Mercury and Zeus or Hercules or
[35:44] whatever they say you know the different
[35:46] ones which when they heard it did they
[35:48] say yes I am one of the Gods is that
[35:50] what they said
[35:51] no they said I'm a man with passions
[35:54] just like you
[35:56] I'm no different than you God just used
[35:58] me God just spoke through me God just
[36:01] said his virtue through me praise God
[36:03] right virtue
[36:05] he just sent the pot the healing power
[36:07] he sent it through me
[36:10] but I'm not I'm nothing special I'm no
[36:12] God I'm not now
[36:14] he went Paul had scripture I came out of
[36:16] the mind of Christ he had scripture he
[36:19] could have said well no I am a God I
[36:21] came out of the mind of Christ I was
[36:22] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[36:23] world he could have used that but he
[36:25] didn't
[36:27] why because they wanted to worship them
[36:30] and no real Christian will take worship
[36:32] from anybody
[36:33] right they may be tempted but they'll
[36:35] overcome
[36:39] how do you do these things we're men
[36:40] we're just men we got passions like
[36:42] you've got
[36:44] to turn from your vanities to the Living
[36:46] God
[36:49] that's the one time Christians were
[36:51] called gods in the New Testament if I'm
[36:53] not I'm saying like this with love with
[36:54] all the love in my heart check me church
[36:56] just check me honestly check me that's
[36:58] what I told the Saints and Napoleon if
[37:00] you're struggling getting further away
[37:01] from God then you got to have something
[37:02] you study every day you got to find a
[37:03] topic to study
[37:05] you got to keep your mind on the word of
[37:07] God
[37:08] it's like for me uh what was I studying
[37:11] the other day
[37:11] oh the seventh seal so I gave all my
[37:14] mornings I just studied the seven seal
[37:15] Seven Seals
[37:16] I got some good sermons coming up on
[37:18] that too
[37:19] I'm just kidding I mean I couldn't reach
[37:21] out you probably heard most of it before
[37:23] but you just got to do that you got to
[37:25] keep your mind on the word
[37:27] if not you're gonna get distracted if
[37:29] you're not studying God's word what are
[37:30] you gonna you're gonna study something
[37:32] right and studying cookbooks is okay
[37:37] studying for your Taekwondo test is okay
[37:39] right milk
[37:40] I mean you got it we're living on this
[37:43] Earth we've got to do things like that
[37:44] but I'm saying overall you got to make
[37:46] sure your attitude is I'm hungry for
[37:48] more of God's word
[37:50] by a journal I'll give you one like I
[37:51] buy the kids those notepads I'll give
[37:53] you a two dollar notepad praise God you
[37:55] go home and you just study every day
[37:56] just write down just study the topic
[37:58] keep your mind on God's word
[38:02] that's how you keep it fresh
[38:03] remember the Bible says they that
[38:05] meditate on God it's a the Bible said
[38:07] it's a tree of life to them I say I just
[38:08] preached that fear of the Lord's sermon
[38:09] so it's fresh in my mind
[38:11] if you meditate on God it's a tree of
[38:13] life to you
[38:15] because you're fearing God you're
[38:16] keeping the Commandments you're taking
[38:18] notes on God's word it's life to you
[38:20] it's like a stream the Bible said the
[38:22] fear Lord like a stream and then it
[38:24] feeds the the tree and the tree puts
[38:27] forth wisdom praise God hallelujah amen
[38:33] oh and this is a nice testimony one of
[38:36] the families
[38:39] uh one of the families out there is
[38:41] Derek's family
[38:44] um
[38:46] so Derek's mother-in-law is 82 years old
[38:50] and they were praying that uh they said
[38:53] they've been praying her for her for 20
[38:54] years to accept Christ and finally
[38:58] she accepted Christ I think she moved
[39:00] from California or something all the way
[39:01] to Napoleon just to receive Christ
[39:06] and she said she come up the first thing
[39:08] she said she said I love your YouTube
[39:10] videos she said I watched all your
[39:12] videos on the Book of Revelation that's
[39:14] 22 videos
[39:17] and and her her daughter's like yes
[39:18] after the first one she's like I could
[39:20] actually understand that that was so
[39:21] simple I could understand it and she
[39:24] said I want another
[39:25] and they got done with the first one
[39:27] second one she said I want to watch
[39:28] another
[39:29] and so she spent the next two days
[39:31] watching all my videos on the Book of
[39:32] Revelation and she's going to be
[39:34] baptized on April 1st by God's grace
[39:37] so you never know where your influence
[39:39] is going to go right brother says like
[39:40] that rock drop it in the pond
[39:42] your food's just going to go out
[39:45] right
[39:46] so just love Jesus testify do good to
[39:48] other people give alms fast pray and
[39:51] your influence is going to spread out
[39:57] now uh
[39:59] we have this principle you know when
[40:01] people call themselves Gods we must
[40:03] remember
[40:04] I don't really don't agree with that you
[40:06] know I mean I could agree with some of
[40:07] the verses but I don't think it's a good
[40:08] process to go around or good practice to
[40:10] go around calling yourself a god
[40:12] because the principle is there's only
[40:14] one God
[40:15] and God Alone gets the glory
[40:18] okay and so that's very very simple
[40:20] Deuteronomy 32 39 see now that I even I
[40:23] am he and there's no God with me so see
[40:26] well you say I'm one of the Gods well
[40:28] God said there's no other gods with me
[40:31] you see it's not something God people
[40:33] are trying to make themselves out to be
[40:34] like I'm all-powerful and I've got so
[40:36] much power I've got so much Authority
[40:38] only the authority God gives you
[40:41] right
[40:44] I kill I make alive I wound I heal
[40:46] neither is there any that can deliver
[40:48] out of my hand
[40:51] Isaiah 42 8 I am the Lord that is my
[40:53] name and my glory will I not give to
[40:56] another neither my praise to graven
[40:58] images
[40:59] okay praise God
[41:01] all right so we can plainly see that now
[41:03] that's why I've always been
[41:05] careful on this topic I think that's the
[41:07] best word to say now let's look at a few
[41:08] of these quotes now
[41:10] in in these quotes you'll see brother
[41:11] Raymond I've known the I've heard these
[41:12] quotes oh many times over the years
[41:16] brother random brings out the fact that
[41:18] Jesus is talking about prophets the word
[41:20] of God comes to Prophets
[41:22] okay and that's what Jesus was talking
[41:24] about uh like with with Moses was a God
[41:27] to Pharaoh okay because the word of God
[41:30] came to Moses All right but also at the
[41:33] same time we got to keep in mind that
[41:34] these verses brother Ram uses about the
[41:37] Holy Spirit anointing people are
[41:39] legitimate
[41:41] right and God does want to anoint us
[41:43] sometimes to do great things
[41:48] but the trouble is people that read
[41:49] brother random sermons many of them are
[41:50] not born again and they'll take a
[41:52] they'll take a a quote he makes and
[41:54] they'll make it a false Doctrine like
[41:56] she is him I mean that's true in one
[41:59] sense but not the sense they're saying
[42:01] I'm the greatest of all time well you
[42:03] just you just Twisted the quote the
[42:04] wrong way
[42:05] that's not what brother Brandon was
[42:06] talking about
[42:08] now but God especially upon Adam breathe
[42:10] the breath of eternal life and he became
[42:11] an eternal person with God he had power
[42:13] like God he was an amateur God
[42:17] now I forgot the word amateur I looked
[42:18] that up earlier uh
[42:20] it was actually kind of a funny
[42:21] definition
[42:22] an amateur gods
[42:26] let me look it up here real quick you
[42:28] should only take 10 seconds
[42:30] amateur
[42:33] okay so amateur means uh
[42:37] one who engages as a Pastime but not as
[42:40] a profession so someone who's not a
[42:43] professional at something
[42:44] as someone who lacks experience and
[42:46] competence
[42:48] well if he's an amateur God then he he
[42:50] lacks experience as God
[42:52] he's not as competent as God as God as
[42:55] competent as God
[42:57] that's a mouthful
[42:59] he was God of the earth not God Of
[43:01] Heaven now God of the earth and someday
[43:03] the sons of God will again become Gods
[43:06] now I believe that because the Bible
[43:07] says that
[43:08] there's going to come a time
[43:10] when we are
[43:12] way better than the condition now that
[43:14] we are right now by God's grace
[43:16] Glory
[43:17] church I'm coming to a condition where
[43:19] I'm not going to sin again amen oh God
[43:23] hastens the day Hallelujah
[43:25] I won't get old I won't get tired I can
[43:27] walk through walls I can't right now
[43:29] because I'll bump up into the wall
[43:31] but you're going to get a glorified body
[43:32] that can walk right through walls praise
[43:34] God
[43:35] it can vanish it can appear to another
[43:37] place
[43:38] think of that a thousand years we'll
[43:40] have bodies that can just vanish
[43:42] from the North American area I don't
[43:44] know there won't be Seas I'm not sure
[43:46] how that works we can go to another
[43:47] place look at that
[43:50] for a thousand years
[43:52] brother what are we going to do brother
[43:53] for a thousand years
[43:55] what are we gonna do
[43:57] taking care of these heathens around
[43:58] here
[44:00] what are we going to do with glorified
[44:02] bodies someday we will
[44:04] be as those Gods because we'll never sin
[44:06] again
[44:08] we'll be judges we'll be judges we'll be
[44:09] rulers over the whole Earth
[44:12] that's what the Bible says that's the
[44:13] promise for the overcomer
[44:16] Jesus said so it's not written in your
[44:17] law your gods that if you can call them
[44:20] whom he called God who God visited how
[44:22] can you condemn me when I say I'm the
[44:24] Son of God see now we're getting into
[44:26] something deep now watch this when we
[44:27] drive it down now another quote
[44:30] he's talking about again about Adam
[44:32] he talks about how the real seed of God
[44:34] absorbs the spirit
[44:36] like a seed needs water absorbed right
[44:39] all the nominations took out of it all
[44:42] in belief is out and when the Holy
[44:43] Spirit comes to that German life is
[44:44] laying there it produces another seed
[44:46] just exactly another Son of God is born
[44:48] amen another amateur God a son of God
[44:54] oh yeah here's the word I was looking
[44:55] for uh the word amateur means a dabbler
[44:59] see I I dabble with trying to fix things
[45:01] at my house
[45:03] I'm no professional
[45:05] I've tried to fix the sink numerous
[45:07] times I think I might only fix it one
[45:08] time I'm just dabbling under there how
[45:10] do I get I was just lucky to change the
[45:12] tire we had a flat tire the other day I
[45:13] was just lucky to change the tire I was
[45:14] like thank you Lord
[45:16] actually change the tire
[45:18] I could not have done without maokai
[45:20] hold the flashlight
[45:22] I'm just a dabbler I'm just an amateur
[45:25] I'm not a professional but you come to
[45:27] first grade there I'm a professional
[45:28] people pay me for that I take a lot of
[45:30] classes to become a good teacher I'm a
[45:32] professional I can do that better than
[45:33] most people unless you've been paid to
[45:35] do it right you've learned how to do it
[45:37] right that's just how it is like amen's
[45:39] professional I couldn't do his job
[45:40] without all the training
[45:43] but
[45:44] here we're just dabbling Ah that's what
[45:47] the Bible says the Bible said we see
[45:49] through a glass Darkly
[45:52] oh brother just had this real spiritual
[45:54] experience you're still just seeing
[45:55] through a glass Darkly yeah
[45:58] because give it a week and let's see if
[45:59] you're still on mountaintop here let's
[46:00] see
[46:02] Hallelujah
[46:04] let's see let's give it a couple weeks
[46:05] and let's see how you're doing
[46:06] spiritually
[46:07] that's what I found look we danced we
[46:09] had all those great Services now look
[46:10] what's happening we're going through
[46:10] some trials
[46:12] now God allows them
[46:14] to keep us humble
[46:16] and to teach us to keep praising God in
[46:19] the midst of the storm
[46:21] right
[46:22] see we can't remain on the mount you
[46:24] can't live on the Mountaintop I wish we
[46:26] could
[46:27] I really do
[46:28] manifested the works manifested the same
[46:31] same by US versus the same word now if
[46:34] you want to do the works of Christ do
[46:35] the same thing he's he done he that
[46:37] believeth on me shall have my Works what
[46:39] is it believeth what that he's the
[46:41] Original Seed germ that come Christ is
[46:43] the seed of God that come right he's a
[46:45] true Son of God the son of God
[46:47] here's another one to talk about Adam
[46:49] as long as Adam made from the Tree of
[46:51] Life he had eternal life in the blue and
[46:53] we'd again notice Adam he inherit the
[46:55] earth he was like an amateur God over
[46:56] the Earth the Earth was his everything
[46:58] was given unto his hand he could do
[46:59] whatever he wanted with it he named it
[47:01] now look at that he named it
[47:02] he called it the animals and done
[47:05] whatever he wanted he was truly a son of
[47:07] God
[47:08] okay now then what it attitude he
[47:10] forfeited it and now Satan becomes a
[47:12] lowercase God of this world now that's
[47:15] what the rest of that's about
[47:17] Adam had the keys right Adam had the
[47:19] power of the authority well he was
[47:20] overcome and whoever overcomes you takes
[47:22] your keys that's what happened
[47:24] now Satan is a God of this world
[47:26] the ruler the judge I remember maybe not
[47:29] not in a spiritual sense but he just has
[47:31] control over the governments
[47:33] right he's a ruler of the governments
[47:35] Jesus said so Jesus didn't rebuke him
[47:37] when he said that
[47:39] see man was made to be a God to be a god
[47:42] did you know that he's in the image of
[47:43] God he's the son of God he's like him in
[47:46] other words God made us to be god-like
[47:49] okay he was given a domain Genesis 1 26
[47:52] dominion over the whole earth that's
[47:54] right he Ruled the Earth he ruled the
[47:55] animal kingdom and all the other
[47:56] kingdoms all the kingdom all but the
[47:58] kingdom of God above he was God he was
[48:00] an amateur God he was made the image of
[48:02] God made like God and had hands and feet
[48:03] like God of course God's invisible so
[48:05] that's he must have met theophany he was
[48:08] in the image of God what happened
[48:09] because he disbelieved God's word I sent
[48:11] him right back out to shift for himself
[48:13] now God's trying to get him back when
[48:17] you have faith in accepting my brother
[48:18] just let that little light begin to grow
[48:20] out taking all the roots of doubt and
[48:22] bitterness yielding yourself to the
[48:23] spirit then you'll be begin to become a
[48:25] Son of God a daughter of God begin to
[48:27] grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit
[48:28] begins to build his kingdom within you
[48:30] praise God
[48:32] oh thank God Amen
[48:34] thank God
[48:36] we don't have to go anywhere to join the
[48:38] kingdom Jesus sends the Kingdom right
[48:40] into you praise God
[48:42] hallelujah thank God
[48:45] Jehovah Jireh 61.
[48:48] now again it goes over Genesis 1 26
[48:50] where Adam would speak he'd say Be Still
[48:52] he'd speak to the uh the winds and
[48:54] everything and in the garden and all the
[48:57] world's groaning waiting for the
[48:58] manifestation of the sons of God waiting
[48:59] for the church to get back in its right
[49:01] place sons of God to be made manifest
[49:03] waiting for that hour hope that don't
[49:05] hurt but I just had to say it the church
[49:06] is so far away from its place
[49:09] it needs me back to be sons and of God
[49:12] again
[49:13] now here's where he says look rulers
[49:15] governors of the Earth
[49:17] under the spiritual Reign it will be
[49:19] someday when the chief one comes Jesus
[49:22] Christ the great Millennium Nature's
[49:24] groaning for that day
[49:26] now go take your Bible go back to Romans
[49:28] 8. this is the right interpretation I
[49:30] believe of this verse Romans when I say
[49:32] 8 19.
[49:34] and I think I mentioned this in the
[49:36] Bible study about three weeks ago
[49:38] usually it's rare I'm out two Sundays in
[49:40] a row how many how many think that's
[49:42] pretty rare
[49:43] that's super rare I'm hardly ever out
[49:45] two in a row but
[49:46] the way it worked out I felt like it was
[49:49] a love of the Lord
[49:53] no
[49:54] to me this is the right interpretation
[49:56] of the manifestation of the sons of God
[49:58] now the reason I have to preach this is
[50:00] because some people will take some of
[50:02] these quotes from Brother random and say
[50:03] uh we'll see when right before the
[50:05] Rapture we're going to become these
[50:06] manifested sons of God and all the Earth
[50:08] just wants us to to speak
[50:11] whatever we need before the rapture
[50:14] like I'll speak somebody's arm to grow
[50:16] back or I'll
[50:17] I'll speak just amazing things well that
[50:20] could be but in this context that's not
[50:22] what it's about this context is about
[50:25] the millennium
[50:27] and here's the proof listen to me
[50:30] if the manifested sons of God
[50:33] is what the Earth is groaning for well
[50:36] then the Earth is going to be sorely
[50:37] disappointed because right after Rapture
[50:39] the Earth is going to get destroyed
[50:42] and the church said
[50:44] to the Earth so the Earth is just
[50:46] groaning for you know whatever time of
[50:48] the latter rain and then
[50:50] it's going to get destroyed it's not
[50:52] groaning for that it's groaning for a
[50:54] brand new creation amen
[50:57] it's growing where the whole sin every
[50:59] all the wickedness gets burned up and we
[51:02] get a fresh start again praise God it's
[51:04] a new heavens and the new Earth praise
[51:06] God
[51:06] that's what it's groaning for
[51:10] it's not groaning for a third of the men
[51:12] to spill their blood on the earth that's
[51:13] not what the Earth is groaning for
[51:16] is that groaning for a third of the
[51:18] oceans that turn to blood and see how
[51:20] the animals wash up on shore because
[51:21] they're dead for drinking in the blood
[51:23] or whatever how that however that
[51:24] happens passes through their bodies
[51:26] that's not what the Earth is groaning
[51:27] for
[51:28] the Earth is guarding for a brand new
[51:30] start praise God
[51:32] the Earth is groaning for a ruler over
[51:34] the Earth
[51:36] who rules with the rod of iron and his
[51:38] name is Jesus Hallelujah that's what
[51:40] it's groaning for amen
[51:42] a holy ruler
[51:46] now
[51:48] verse 20 Romans 8 20. for the creature
[51:51] was made subject to vanity not willingly
[51:53] but by reason of him who has subjected
[51:54] the same in Hope because the creature
[51:56] itself also shall be delivered from the
[51:58] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[52:00] Liberty of the children of God now look
[52:03] Nature has to be delivered out of
[52:05] corruption
[52:06] but the Earth is going to be corrupted
[52:08] and ruined in the tribulation period
[52:12] so the manifestation of the sons of God
[52:14] is when the earth gets a new start we
[52:16] get a new body there's no more
[52:18] destruction and it's all Victory praise
[52:20] God Amen the millennium
[52:23] see context is always King they say
[52:25] context is key
[52:27] verse 22 for we know that the whole
[52:29] creation groaned and travailed in pain
[52:32] together until now and not only they but
[52:34] ourselves also which have the verse
[52:36] words of the spirit even ourselves grow
[52:37] what are we groaning for our church
[52:41] waiting for what the adoption to it the
[52:44] Redemption of our body this is speaking
[52:46] of either the Rapture right well
[52:48] speaking definitely the rapture that's
[52:50] what we're groaning for
[52:52] creation's groaning for a time when
[52:54] there's no more Wars no more destruction
[52:56] we're groaning for a new body
[52:59] and the older you get the more you groan
[53:02] enjoy it Malachi and Lydia enjoy that
[53:04] enjoy the teen years they sure don't
[53:06] last long
[53:09] true though they don't last long
[53:13] what are we groaning for a brand new
[53:16] body
[53:17] so this is speaking of the rapture
[53:20] okay
[53:23] okay I think I'll stop right there yeah
[53:25] we'll stop right there okay so the
[53:26] context is the millennium
[53:29] we get a new body the Earth
[53:31] has no more suffering the the creation
[53:33] will not groan anymore
[53:36] all right and I'm about an hour here so
[53:38] let me try to close here let's see
[53:43] here uh
[53:45] let me see I got one let me X out of
[53:47] this real quick so many quotes I got
[53:51] I don't know if I should quote you to
[53:52] life or not here let's see
[54:03] okay see sometimes I just don't know how
[54:05] to uh let me let me close it this here
[54:06] I'm going to close here
[54:08] okay so this is the reasons why you've
[54:09] never heard me say
[54:12] come on Church we're gods
[54:15] or something like that I just
[54:17] that's not my
[54:18] that's not my understanding
[54:20] I don't hear Brother I am saying that a
[54:22] lot right
[54:25] where you see it is all this uh
[54:29] they call it the new
[54:31] Apostolic Reformation it's like the
[54:33] Kenneth Copeland's Of The World the
[54:34] Benny hens
[54:36] uh Even Rick Joyner
[54:39] they call it the NR or any Nar or
[54:41] something like that
[54:43] um who's the Bethel guy again
[54:45] Bill Johnson
[54:47] okay all these famous
[54:49] preachers right
[54:51] they call them I mean they'll just take
[54:52] the liberty and say we're gods and
[54:55] you know the one guy says we've got the
[54:57] one guy from Bethel said we all have the
[54:59] mantle of William Branham now think of
[55:00] that
[55:01] well when are you going to start
[55:03] Discerning all the thoughts when are you
[55:05] going to start a prayer line that's why
[55:06] I told Joseph Joseph when are you going
[55:07] to start a prayer line
[55:09] brother Graham said Joseph's going to
[55:11] get double times double of everything
[55:13] that I got I said well I'm still waiting
[55:15] for that first prayer line
[55:17] double times double means times four
[55:20] so Joseph has to do four times the
[55:22] prayer lines that brother Bram did you
[55:24] better get started you're 1665.
[55:27] you better get started pretty soon
[55:29] see you can't make every quote thus
[55:30] saith the Lord
[55:32] that's just a father's desire I want to
[55:34] see my son and have more than my I mean
[55:35] that's what I want I want malachite to
[55:37] do a better job preaching than I do
[55:39] but he might not be a preacher
[55:43] right but in my own human desires uh
[55:45] well I hope Zion is a better preacher
[55:47] than I am
[55:48] God help him
[55:52] there's no thou saith Lord behind it
[55:54] then we're just we're just expressing
[55:56] our human thoughts we're not creating
[55:57] anything there it is brother brother
[56:00] Brown couldn't create Joseph doing four
[56:02] times the amount of prayer prayer lines
[56:04] as he did
[56:05] see because we don't we can't create
[56:06] whatever we want
[56:09] all we can do is be positive and hope
[56:10] for the best we have to wait for the
[56:12] Holy Spirit to come
[56:14] amen
[56:17] now look I prayed I said God give me a
[56:19] son in my own image and look God gave me
[56:21] one that's one time God did hear me
[56:25] people tell me that all the time your
[56:27] son looks just like you I said that's so
[56:29] sad for him I should not have prayed
[56:31] that
[56:32] why did I curse my son
[56:35] I'm just kidding buddy
[56:38] I love you
[56:41] that's one time God did hear my prayer
[56:46] so these are the reasons why I've never
[56:48] I've never majored on this I don't see
[56:50] Paul you or Peter or James or anyone
[56:54] Jude saying oh you're a bunch of gods I
[56:57] just don't that's not the language that
[56:58] you they say your servants were Sons
[57:00] were Saints
[57:03] okay so that's why I never major on that
[57:06] scripture John 10 34. I believe it I
[57:09] believe it there's times God calls us
[57:11] gods
[57:13] but he doesn't mean I'm we're co-equal
[57:17] now there's even let me just share this
[57:18] now there's even a false Doctrine going
[57:20] around the message church is that in the
[57:22] bride will be the fullness of the
[57:24] godhead bodily think of that I've heard
[57:26] prominent message preachers think of
[57:28] that just think for a moment here
[57:31] brother bear says think real deep on
[57:33] these things that's what he says I have
[57:34] a quote on that think real deep
[57:37] the fullness of the godhead bodily will
[57:40] be in the bride at the Rapture I've
[57:42] heard prominent preachers say that
[57:47] doesn't Jesus have the fullness of the
[57:48] godhead bodily in him
[57:50] what's he gonna do take it out of his
[57:51] body and put it in all the bride members
[57:54] he'd have to do that
[57:58] what about the fullness of God in all
[58:00] the saints that have already died
[58:02] what he's going to do take the Holy
[58:04] Ghost off them and put it on us
[58:05] you see how it makes no sense
[58:08] it makes no sense
[58:09] and the people will amen and they'll get
[58:12] 4 000 views and I don't care about the
[58:14] views I'm just saying like this is what
[58:15] people swallow they don't even they
[58:17] don't even think about it just because a
[58:19] preacher says who has great testimonies
[58:21] and I appreciate testimonies I love
[58:22] thank God God did it thank God
[58:25] but they won't even they won't even
[58:26] think about these things
[58:28] they'll say the fullness of the God in
[58:30] it will be in The Bride of the rapture
[58:33] not true
[58:34] it's not true
[58:36] we're going to have a great anointing of
[58:37] the Holy Ghost we're going to have a
[58:39] Reign the Bible says let's use let's use
[58:41] the Bible words amen
[58:43] Hallelujah for me Bible Believers let's
[58:45] believe the Bible let's quote the Bible
[58:47] praise God
[58:52] Hallelujah I'm just that I just laugh
[58:55] because I'm joyful
[58:56] praise God because I know where I'm
[58:57] standing
[58:58] I prayed enough I've studied enough I've
[59:00] laid before God enough I've wept enough
[59:03] I've sought God enough where I know
[59:04] where I'm standing praise God
[59:08] that's what I want you to do too I want
[59:10] you to seek God enough where you know
[59:12] where you're standing
[59:14] Jesus said make sure that no man can
[59:17] deceive you
[59:18] that's what Jesus said
[59:20] so you better study yourself approved
[59:23] praise God
[59:25] all right second reason you know we
[59:27] could use gods for both prophets and all
[59:29] the children of God according to Psalm
[59:31] 82 but let's remain humble and I don't
[59:34] want to cause people to stumble
[59:37] because if I say I'm a god brother
[59:39] Austin and then somebody watching me do
[59:41] something good or somebody gets saved or
[59:43] someone gets healed or someone gets
[59:44] blessed or something and then they watch
[59:46] me sin now that looks really awful
[59:50] because I just exalted myself and then I
[59:52] fell short
[59:53] of what I was confessing now yes I want
[59:56] a positive confession yes I want I want
[59:58] to speak God's word I want to be
[59:59] creative
[1:00:00] I mean I want to believe God's word
[1:00:02] but I don't want to stumble people like
[1:00:04] that well Jesse did that so what is
[1:00:07] Christianity even mean anything
[1:00:10] he said he's a god
[1:00:12] that's why I'd rather say I'm just a
[1:00:13] humble like brother I'm a humble servant
[1:00:15] saved by grace
[1:00:16] I am a sinner Say by grace
[1:00:19] yes I'm a son of God but I'm going to
[1:00:21] remain humble
[1:00:24] because Pride goes before the fall
[1:00:28] Pride goes before the fall
[1:00:31] and I'm a man just like you a woman or
[1:00:33] whatever you're like you're subject to
[1:00:35] the passions of this world
[1:00:38] right sometimes we give into passions we
[1:00:40] shouldn't give into
[1:00:42] right
[1:00:45] and also this uh the manifestation of
[1:00:47] the sons of God
[1:00:49] um there's some quotes I didn't get to
[1:00:51] but
[1:00:51] um some of them have been preached by
[1:00:54] preachers without a clear context of
[1:00:55] what brother Brown's talking about
[1:00:58] like Joel there's a scripture in Joel
[1:00:59] where the Bible says the army of God
[1:01:01] will leap over a wall
[1:01:03] and I don't know if that applies to the
[1:01:04] Jews or the Gentiles
[1:01:07] now Church think about the book of Acts
[1:01:08] Church we're going back to the book of
[1:01:10] Acts did they ever jump over a wall can
[1:01:12] anybody find me a verse in the book of
[1:01:14] Acts where they jumped over a wall
[1:01:17] I don't think so they turn the word
[1:01:19] upside down though
[1:01:20] they turn the walls upside down
[1:01:22] spiritually
[1:01:24] it's a seed though and they'll make
[1:01:26] these claims and then they'll make
[1:01:27] claims like in the squeeze we're going
[1:01:28] to jump over buildings
[1:01:32] and see they got a verse that they think
[1:01:33] they can use but how do you know that
[1:01:35] applies that way
[1:01:39] so see I want to be very careful I don't
[1:01:41] want to promise you something
[1:01:43] that I don't know is going to come to
[1:01:45] pass
[1:01:47] praise God
[1:01:49] that's why I there's quotes brother
[1:01:51] Branham says oh yeah he says I and
[1:01:53] they're good quotes I mean I feel he
[1:01:55] said I feel so encouraged I feel like I
[1:01:56] could run through a troop and jump over
[1:01:58] a wall
[1:02:00] I mean that's he's quoting the scripture
[1:02:02] I'm I'm thankful he would felt he felt
[1:02:05] inspired like that
[1:02:06] but we better be careful how we apply
[1:02:08] that to our lives
[1:02:13] Hallelujah
[1:02:17] and so so sometimes quotes or sometimes
[1:02:20] they're they're just or sometimes
[1:02:22] scripture is just vaguely applied to the
[1:02:24] latter rain or vaguely applied to the
[1:02:26] Rapture without a clear interpretation
[1:02:28] of it
[1:02:30] so again I believe some of these things
[1:02:31] are possible but we're not certain
[1:02:35] right people that ask me that all the
[1:02:37] time what's going to happen at the
[1:02:37] Rapture what's going to happen with the
[1:02:38] squeeze I don't know
[1:02:40] I don't know all the details I just know
[1:02:42] what the Bible says praise God
[1:02:45] so I just want to be careful
[1:02:47] and again the the groaning part remember
[1:02:48] the groaning part
[1:02:50] the creation's groaning not I don't
[1:02:52] believe for the Rapture I believe
[1:02:53] creation is groaning for the millennium
[1:02:57] because then there will be no more
[1:02:59] suffering in nature
[1:03:01] okay
[1:03:03] how many sons and daughters of God we
[1:03:05] got out there all right let's stand to
[1:03:06] our feet I'm gonna stop right there
[1:03:07] praise God preach over about an hour and
[1:03:09] a half musicians can come
[1:03:11] hour and 15. so that's a good start
[1:03:13] maybe I'll pick up on that on Sunday
[1:03:15] by God's grace how many enjoyed that
[1:03:17] message tonight
[1:03:18] now it's just a start
[1:03:21] in terms that's the thing I like we have
[1:03:23] these needs in our church we have sick
[1:03:24] people you know we have I don't want to
[1:03:26] discourage your faith
[1:03:28] but I don't also don't want you to have
[1:03:30] fake faith
[1:03:34] now the course I didn't get to is
[1:03:35] brother Adam says see Jesus said you're
[1:03:37] a God and he said speak to the mountain
[1:03:40] it'll move now I believe that
[1:03:42] I've spoken to a couple different
[1:03:43] situations and God moved
[1:03:47] but I did it one time and it did it or
[1:03:49] twice and it didn't move
[1:03:50] because it was just my emotion
[1:03:53] I said I'm sorry
[1:03:54] I said Lord I'm sorry
[1:03:59] because Church what are we doing we're
[1:04:01] looking through a glass Darkly
[1:04:04] we're just doing the best we can
[1:04:06] now you can stop the live stream
