[5:57] that all of our hopes in you tonight in
[5:58] Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said
[6:01] amen God bless you as you're being
[6:02] seated praise God
[6:05] I have a few slides here we'll show
[6:07] about God's grace good to see brother
[6:08] Ray God bless you sir
[6:09] hallelujah praise God
[6:11] good to see you sir
[6:13] so we'll see how far we can get here
[6:15] tonight by the grace of the Lord
[6:19] you know as I was looking at this
[6:21] chapter you know we got into chapter
[6:23] five there last Wednesday night but as I
[6:26] was looking I was curious I started
[6:28] going through some other quotes from
[6:29] Brother Branham so I just we thought I'd
[6:31] share a brief quote again from Brother
[6:32] Branham on Romans chapter four about
[6:34] staggering not at the promise of God
[6:36] uh brother random speaking of Sarah she
[6:38] was included in it God never gives Sarah
[6:40] the promise he'd give Abraham a promise
[6:43] but Sarah was included he made the
[6:46] promise in Christ Jesus and I was
[6:49] included in him you were too
[6:52] don't you love this thought here how
[6:54] brother Ram takes Abraham and Sarah
[6:55] Sarah's the bride a part of the husband
[6:57] and here Christ is the husband we're
[6:59] part of the Bride so we get promises in
[7:03] Christ Jesus
[7:04] and church the greatest one is what
[7:06] eternal life
[7:08] that's the greatest promise praise God
[7:09] and that's in Christ the Bible said
[7:12] remember in chapter the next chapter
[7:13] we'll get to it the Bible says the word
[7:14] if we die with Christ we'll also raise
[7:16] with Christ amen what a what a complete
[7:19] promise amen all of our promises are in
[7:22] Christ Jesus we must remember that
[7:23] Hallelujah
[7:25] he said he staggered not at the promise
[7:27] of God through unbelief but was strong
[7:28] in faith given glory to God and being
[7:31] fully persuaded that what he had
[7:33] promised he was able to perform
[7:34] therefore it was imputed to him for
[7:36] righteousness now it was not written for
[7:40] his sake alone it wasn't imputed but
[7:42] unto him
[7:43] but for us also to whom it shall be
[7:45] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[7:49] Jesus our lord from the dead
[7:52] said oh he reads again who was delivered
[7:55] for our fence and was raised again for
[7:57] our justification oh brother now look at
[7:59] this I could just hit the devil in the
[8:01] face with that
[8:03] 365 days a year praise God I mean like
[8:06] that how many how many know you have to
[8:07] have spiritual battles with the Devil
[8:09] Ram says I could hit the devil in the
[8:11] face with this section
[8:13] remember what did Brother Adam say right
[8:14] before he died a month before he died he
[8:16] said when I'm blue when I'm discouraged
[8:18] when I'm depressed I go to Romans
[8:20] chapter 4. where Abraham didn't stagger
[8:23] at the promise of God
[8:25] so I just thought you liked that you
[8:26] know brother random said he could use
[8:28] this scripture every day to overcome the
[8:30] devil and say devil you're a liar
[8:31] there's the word I'm Healed because my
[8:34] healing is through Jesus Christ
[8:36] every promise whatever I have a need of
[8:38] is through Christ Hallelujah trusting in
[8:41] the promise of God so I thought that
[8:42] would be encouragement to you by God's
[8:45] grace also it was neat to see brother
[8:47] random use uh the verse we read tonight
[8:48] Romans 5 verse 1 at least 12 times
[8:51] there's different ways you can search
[8:52] with you know partial words and
[8:54] everything but I found at least 12 times
[8:56] and these sad people may Lord may God
[8:59] have mercy on their souls these these
[9:00] sad people that leave the message and
[9:01] say brother Brandon wasn't a Bible
[9:03] teacher brother man wasn't in in
[9:05] preaching for uh for religious purposes
[9:08] but for monetary purposes these sad
[9:10] people uh they must for all those years
[9:13] there in the message they must have not
[9:14] even listening to the tapes
[9:16] because brother and quotes verbatim
[9:18] Romans 5 verse 1 which isn't like a
[9:21] verse we'd say you know all the churches
[9:23] memorize right they memorize John 3 16.
[9:26] if brother man was just trying to skirt
[9:27] by and just trying to you know make some
[9:29] money
[9:30] why would he labor on verses that are
[9:32] not so well known but he labors on these
[9:35] verses that bring the people to
[9:37] Salvation praise God Amen I love that
[9:39] about brother random he was into the
[9:41] word he'd bring the word hallelujah he'd
[9:43] read his text remember he said I always
[9:45] read a text before I preach because my
[9:47] words will fail but God's words can
[9:49] never fail amen he says that over and
[9:52] over and over again I love the fact that
[9:55] many times I can just type in a few
[9:56] verses in program search and I'll come
[9:59] up with scriptures because brother and
[10:01] was faithful in teaching the people the
[10:03] word of God Amen now what was different
[10:06] though that some people you know at
[10:07] least a few people that have left the
[10:09] message that have told me uh in some of
[10:12] the sermons brother Ram is into so many
[10:13] stories and Visions well what would you
[10:15] do if you were a prophet and you lived
[10:17] in the visions of Dimensions right if
[10:20] you had constant missions all throughout
[10:21] the day and you knew if you told them
[10:23] they'd help the people and they'd
[10:25] vindicate that you were sent from God
[10:26] wouldn't you tell those of course you
[10:28] would it's just like Ezekiel telling his
[10:30] visions and Jeremiah telling his visions
[10:32] and all the prophets of God you have to
[10:34] tell your Visions praise God and what
[10:36] brothers was trying to show was that God
[10:38] was with him the same Christ from the
[10:39] Bible was the Christ with brother
[10:41] Branham and church don't be discouraged
[10:42] he's the Christ with us today praise God
[10:45] we need not be discouraged because Jesus
[10:47] Christ cannot change he's the same today
[10:49] as he ever was praise God
[10:51] Hallelujah
[10:54] brother says if you believe that I've
[10:56] been in connection with almighty God
[10:58] if you believe that listen to me now
[11:00] don't let the sun rise on you until
[11:02] something is anchored in your heart that
[11:04] you are a Christian that you're at peace
[11:06] with your enemy you're at peace with God
[11:08] look what he's saying he's like just
[11:09] have peace with God
[11:11] don't don't let this Knight go without
[11:13] knowing you have peace with God why feel
[11:16] like you're an enemy with God why if he
[11:18] was in this for money why would he take
[11:19] time on these scriptures like this he's
[11:22] in this to try to give the people
[11:23] victory over the devil praise God Amen
[11:26] just like I'm in it for that purpose
[11:28] just like you're in it for that purpose
[11:29] you're in this to experience the
[11:31] blessing of Christ on your life how many
[11:33] in it for that reason praise God
[11:35] that's why we're in it to enjoy the
[11:37] blessings of Christ to see the spirit of
[11:39] God make the word a revelation to us and
[11:43] then to then to live the word of God
[11:45] like I was really encouraged last week
[11:46] when Austin sent me a text and said this
[11:48] series on Abraham's really helping me
[11:49] speak the word of God that's why we do
[11:52] it that's just one example now each of
[11:54] you I could probably if I said let's
[11:55] have a testament let's change this we'll
[11:57] make this a testimony meaning and each
[11:58] one of you can come up here and testify
[12:00] how something that was preached has
[12:02] helped you in your life and the church
[12:03] said
[12:04] I mean it's just how it is but that's
[12:06] just one simple modern example a recent
[12:08] example I should say recent
[12:11] that's why we're here we're here to see
[12:13] the people believe the word receive the
[12:15] word because the word is life
[12:18] there's no other life except through the
[12:20] word of God hallelujah amen thank God
[12:23] Amen the word is life praise God and
[12:26] brother Brown said to raise your faith
[12:27] God sends preachers so I'm here uh you
[12:30] know I'm here preaching when I can hear
[12:32] you pulling or when you're not pulling
[12:34] when everybody looks happy whatever it
[12:35] looks sad right it's my job as a
[12:38] minister that's why I'm here I'm here to
[12:39] serve you to tell you God's word and
[12:41] hopefully by the end your faith will be
[12:42] raised amen I don't know which channel
[12:44] you need me to go down but you can
[12:46] direct the channel by pulling on the
[12:48] gift of God hallelujah
[12:50] you can direct that and it's God's word
[12:52] if you believe it we'll give you life
[12:54] it'll give you Victory it'll give you
[12:55] life tomorrow when you need it praise
[12:57] God
[12:58] amen
[13:01] and then he quotes Romans 5 verse 1.
[13:05] if you have enmity against some neighbor
[13:06] against somebody else that's done you
[13:08] harm and that person has done you harm
[13:10] if you and your heart can't love that
[13:12] person don't take that experience
[13:15] in other words don't live like that
[13:16] don't live with hatred towards people
[13:19] you must love those who do not love you
[13:21] like Jesus said if you love those who
[13:23] love you Sinners do the same think about
[13:25] that some people are not even living
[13:26] above a sinner's life yet they call
[13:28] themselves a Christian
[13:30] isn't that so I mean that's sad it makes
[13:32] me laugh but it's like a sad laugh
[13:34] they're calling themselves Christians
[13:36] and they're not even living above a
[13:39] sinner's life
[13:40] well that's all right Church you might
[13:42] the Bible said you might stumble seven
[13:43] times but the righteous will rise again
[13:45] amen Rise Again find it in your heart
[13:48] pray at the altar no church you don't
[13:50] have to pray here but you know if we
[13:52] need Victory we need to pray more praise
[13:54] God if we want Victory we're going to
[13:56] see change in our lives we got to pray
[13:58] more I was thinking today how many
[14:00] people you know if they would just focus
[14:01] on just praying for God give me
[14:03] self-control
[14:04] I was thinking today if we could just
[14:06] pray for temper taught me to control
[14:07] things that I consume and things that I
[14:09] look at and things that I think and
[14:11] things that I say how many people would
[14:13] be Overcomers if they would just pray
[14:14] for more Temperance in their lives
[14:17] in other words controlling yourself not
[14:19] letting yourself get out of control how
[14:21] many more people would feel Victorious
[14:23] if they could pray for more tempers and
[14:25] have more self-control praise God
[14:27] just that one not alone you know the
[14:29] ones that are above that like patience
[14:31] and godliness and brotherly kindness
[14:33] uh just if people would pray for that
[14:35] like I told you that story about my
[14:37] uncle couldn't get he can't get over rum
[14:39] and he'd have such Better Health I mean
[14:41] his lifespan would be so much further I
[14:43] tried to tell him you know Jesus can
[14:45] take care of Rome Jesus can take that
[14:47] you know desire out of you I heard a
[14:49] preacher uh uh I think it was Stacy good
[14:51] bread if I'm not mistaken I was
[14:52] listening yesterday and he said as a
[14:54] sinner he sat in the bar
[14:56] for years and years and years he said
[14:58] and one day the Holy Spirit came and
[15:00] tapped him on the shoulder and he turned
[15:02] around nobody was there and he said
[15:03] something it was like a vacuum something
[15:05] pulled all that desire to drink out of
[15:08] him
[15:09] a church that's a real experience praise
[15:11] God and he said I used to love it you
[15:13] know you love sin for a season right
[15:14] it's pleasurable he loved it loved it
[15:16] all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just
[15:17] takes it out now church if God does that
[15:20] to get a preacher ready to minister God
[15:22] will do that for all of us praise God
[15:23] because all of us can minister in some
[15:25] way brother Brandon said I'd rather have
[15:27] you live me a good sermon than preach me
[15:29] a good one
[15:30] Hallelujah the thing we need is a life
[15:33] that lives the sermon praise God
[15:36] amen
[15:39] he said but you've got to now not to
[15:41] just act like it's a religious act but
[15:43] from your heart you've got to you have
[15:45] to love your enemies
[15:47] Hallelujah I know for most of us that's
[15:49] probably our co-workers right some
[15:51] enemies on the job hopefully there's no
[15:53] enemies in the church praise God if so
[15:56] let's talk about it after so let's have
[15:57] a counseling session after church amen
[15:59] let's get everybody feeling good about
[16:01] each other Amen brother man one time I
[16:02] had to go house the house you know to
[16:04] get you got all the problems in the in
[16:05] the Branham Tabernacle he said all
[16:07] cleaned up he said him and brother never
[16:08] went house to house
[16:09] to clean out the issues he said some
[16:11] people in the brand of Tabernacle
[16:12] wouldn't even walk on the same side of
[16:14] the street
[16:15] downtown Jeffersonville they'd have to
[16:17] cross the other side because they
[16:18] wouldn't want to pass somebody who went
[16:19] to the same church now God help us to
[16:22] never have that help us to love one
[16:24] another by the grace of God
[16:26] amen also here's another one I thought
[16:28] you liked this one
[16:30] he brings in Romans 5 1. I think this is
[16:32] the last one yeah
[16:33] he said now wherefore Jesus also that he
[16:35] might sanctify the people with his own
[16:36] blood suffered without the gates Hebrews
[16:39] 13 12 and 13. Romans 5 1. we read that
[16:42] already but he says he says not by
[16:45] shaking hands now we're not justified by
[16:47] shaking hands that doesn't make you
[16:49] saved
[16:50] right we're not saved by water baptism
[16:52] although we should be baptized
[16:54] we're not saved by laying on of hands
[16:56] not with shouting not with speaking in
[16:57] tongues not with any sensation
[16:59] that's what I love my brother and will
[17:01] pick up these things in these verses
[17:02] that we need to remember
[17:04] because we all fight battles how many
[17:06] fought a battle this week am I in battle
[17:07] or
[17:08] whatever kind of battle spiritual battle
[17:10] whatever kind of battle and so we need
[17:12] reminders you know he brings us back to
[17:15] the Simplicity of just believing that
[17:17] it's by faith we're Justified
[17:20] in other words there's no pressure on
[17:21] you to do some miracle tonight to know
[17:24] you're Justified justification is just
[17:26] by faith Hallelujah the fact you're
[17:28] saved is a gift of God it's God giving
[17:30] you Faith praise God
[17:33] and you just repent and you got faith
[17:34] and now you're Justified you're saved
[17:36] you're righteous amen
[17:39] he says we have peace with God through
[17:41] our Lord Jesus Christ we pass from death
[17:42] into life and become new creatures
[17:44] because we have believed on the only
[17:46] begotten Son of God and accepted him as
[17:48] our personal Savior and his blood acts
[17:51] tonight as a perpetuation for our sin to
[17:54] stand in our place amen hallelujah oh
[17:57] thank God we would stand there condemned
[17:58] in God's presence but the blood takes
[18:00] our place Jesus Takes our place just
[18:03] like he did on the cross thank God he
[18:04] took your place thank God you don't have
[18:06] to stand there as a sinner because you'd
[18:08] be condemned but Jesus stood there for
[18:10] you amen
[18:12] Hallelujah
[18:14] now just as a reminder too I'm going to
[18:16] preach this Lord willing if I go down
[18:18] there to The Junction City in July I
[18:19] might preach this again I've already
[18:21] mentioned this to you but of course
[18:22] brother Adam taught Abraham's life was a
[18:25] type of the three works of Grace
[18:29] he said now notice we was talking the
[18:30] other day and he said therefore we're
[18:32] being justified by faith all right
[18:34] second place after being washed
[18:35] Sanctified so there's the second work of
[18:37] Grace same vacation and then filled with
[18:39] the Holy Ghost justification
[18:41] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost you
[18:42] see it how was his message justification
[18:45] by hearing sanctification is what you do
[18:48] And in regards to what you did in
[18:50] appreciation of that God sealed you by
[18:52] the Holy Ghost
[18:53] so if you're seeking the Holy Ghost just
[18:55] say God give me more appreciation for
[18:57] you
[18:58] right because the more you appreciate
[19:00] somebody the more you want to be a
[19:01] blessing to them well the more you want
[19:02] to help them right
[19:04] so the more we appreciate God the more
[19:06] we'll clean out our lives
[19:09] the more we'll obey the word of God and
[19:10] church even if you've got the Holy Ghost
[19:12] Jesus said I sanctify myself we can all
[19:14] use the good sanctification from time to
[19:16] time
[19:17] all of us so we can all show our
[19:19] appreciation to Jesus
[19:21] amen
[19:23] he says now brother man tells the story
[19:24] many times he said you know you my
[19:26] Baptist brother I'm going to tell you
[19:27] something you say what more could
[19:29] Abraham do but believe God remember he
[19:30] had a preacher tell them that brother
[19:31] man what could Abraham do then just
[19:33] believe God
[19:35] he was trying to he was trying to go
[19:37] against the three works of Grace
[19:40] he said God imputed to him for righteous
[19:42] that's all he could do right here
[19:44] believe God but to accept his belief God
[19:47] give him the seal the circumcision and
[19:49] sealed him showing that God had accepted
[19:52] his faith and if you profess faith in
[19:54] God and has never been sealed by the
[19:56] Holy Ghost in Ephesians 4 30 if you want
[19:58] to put it down grieve not the holy
[20:00] spirit of God whereby you're sealed and
[20:02] you're not sealed until you have
[20:04] received the Holy Ghost amen praise God
[20:07] how many want God to accept your faith
[20:10] church we yes we get saved we accept
[20:13] God's gift but then God wants to see you
[20:15] really accept that gift
[20:17] right right and believe the word of God
[20:19] and obey the word of God and grow in the
[20:21] stature of a perfect man God wants to
[20:23] see you grow as a Christian praise God
[20:25] and then when God says yes you really
[20:27] received it then I give you the Holy
[20:29] Ghost praise God just like Abraham got
[20:32] the Sea of the Holy Spirit praise God
[20:33] but did Abraham have constant mistakes
[20:35] yes he did but was Abraham an overcomer
[20:38] yes he was
[20:39] what are you you're the same you're an
[20:41] overcomer praise God maybe I got the
[20:43] quote up here I think I might just read
[20:44] that quote because it's such a blessing
[20:47] and I put I might even preach this in
[20:49] Iowa brother Brooks asked me to come out
[20:51] preach for him so I'm trying to find a
[20:52] date for that
[20:57] oh yeah right there he said he said we
[20:59] find that his Royal seed is travels the
[21:01] same Journey that's that's bride of
[21:03] Christ travels the same Journey that
[21:05] Abraham did I like that amen this shows
[21:10] the three works of Grace right and I'm
[21:12] gonna skip past my notes there I've
[21:13] already preached that to all of you by
[21:14] God's grace okay now moving on to our
[21:17] new scriptures actually you don't need
[21:19] your Bible here let me set a timer here
[21:21] by God's grace
[21:22] want to be mindful
[21:25] here Romans 5 3 and not only so but we
[21:29] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[21:31] tribulation worketh patience now Glory
[21:34] means to have joy
[21:37] and it's very hard Church to Joy in your
[21:40] trials when they're really serious
[21:42] trials
[21:43] especially like when someone's sick like
[21:45] when brother amen got sick there or
[21:47] uh you know anytime you go through
[21:49] someone's cursing you someone's like
[21:50] Russell brother Austin gets really
[21:52] persecuted at work
[21:53] uh yelled at screamed at
[21:56] and part of it's I think because he's a
[21:57] Christian that's my opinion on it
[21:59] because they know where he stands
[22:02] but it's really hard I would say I'm not
[22:04] going to speak for Austin or brother
[22:05] amen or any of the trials we go through
[22:06] but I imagine it's pretty hard sometimes
[22:08] to be joyful right in the midst of the
[22:10] suffering
[22:12] so Paul of course says talking here from
[22:14] the soul of the believer
[22:19] because when someone's making fun of you
[22:20] or I've had this in the last few years
[22:22] people lie on me tell or call me the
[22:24] devil or call me all kinds of things I
[22:27] don't really particularly feel joyful in
[22:29] those situations but after I go through
[22:31] them and overcome now I can find joy in
[22:34] them
[22:35] so I guess after the fact praise God we
[22:38] can find a lot of joy in those victories
[22:39] because we see God God fought for us
[22:42] we'd have to fight for ourselves we just
[22:44] got to stand on God's word amen
[22:46] amen God fights for his people praise
[22:48] God
[22:50] so we join tribulations also knowing
[22:52] because we know this my trials will work
[22:55] me to be a better patient Christian
[23:00] right
[23:01] most of us believe or most of us
[23:03] understand it's we don't get everything
[23:04] we ask right away
[23:06] right but I make sure like when God
[23:08] healed Austin there uh two Sundays ago
[23:10] God healed him right there on the sermon
[23:11] I made sure we gave God glory right away
[23:13] in the parking lot I don't want to wait
[23:15] till Wednesday
[23:16] I want to glorify him right when it
[23:18] happens praise God because that don't
[23:20] happen all the time
[23:21] right if it does happen instantly then
[23:23] praise God let's let's tell Jesus thank
[23:25] you praise God let's be like that happy
[23:27] leper let's come back and say thank you
[23:29] Jesus amen I don't want to forget this
[23:31] I'm I'm so thankful when you answer
[23:33] prayers immediately praise God
[23:36] but I'm also thankful that you build
[23:38] patience in my life
[23:40] that I'm not gonna I'm not I'm not a
[23:41] complainer that if he don't answer one
[23:43] week well I just gave up I'll just leave
[23:45] Christianity must not be real must not
[23:46] be anything to it
[23:48] see but then God has to answer some of
[23:50] our prayers right away to show us he
[23:52] cares
[23:53] to give us that patience oh amen thank
[23:57] God Amen
[23:58] church I'm getting to something here
[24:00] this is the divine order
[24:03] on how to receive hope
[24:05] how to be a hopeful Christian
[24:07] you know I hear it all the time on the
[24:08] political you know I like to listen to
[24:10] the politics you know after I study and
[24:12] pray in the mornings and you know I'm
[24:13] out about my errands I'll listen to the
[24:15] politics and often these these
[24:18] politician guys will say you know it's
[24:20] hard to have any hope in this day it's
[24:22] hard to have any hope
[24:23] that's their key word like you got to
[24:26] keep hope and sometimes it's hard to
[24:27] have hope and I agree Washington's full
[24:29] of a bunch of devils no doubt about that
[24:31] No Doubt
[24:34] but the main thing they try to do is
[24:36] keep the people hopeful now if they're
[24:38] doing that without the Holy Ghost what
[24:40] should we be doing with the Holy Ghost
[24:42] because I got news for you that's what
[24:44] God wants to be in our lives he wants us
[24:46] to arrive at Hope
[24:48] that no matter what tribulation we're
[24:50] going through we can go through
[24:51] tribulations with joy and then you know
[24:53] we can have a patience and then we'll
[24:56] have character but ultimately the end
[24:59] game the end goal the desired result is
[25:02] so that you're hopeful that you're going
[25:04] to heaven and that Christ is in control
[25:06] of your life amen
[25:08] that's the goal
[25:10] now what is the opposite of hopeful
[25:12] hopeless
[25:13] oh I'll never get out of this situation
[25:15] God's Never Going To Hear My Prayer
[25:17] that's the opposite of what God wants to
[25:19] build in your life
[25:21] God wants to build hope in our lives
[25:23] amen
[25:26] right that's why I love this book that
[25:27] Paul wrote here
[25:29] so here's the three-step process after
[25:31] you get patient then you've got
[25:33] experience which just means character
[25:35] you got some real character
[25:38] right because you you've stood the test
[25:40] of time now you know how to stand as a
[25:41] Christian people can say wow I really
[25:43] see Christ in this brother I see Christ
[25:45] in this sister
[25:46] they've lived it not just for five days
[25:48] or a week they've lived it for a few
[25:49] months now they've lived it for a year
[25:51] my they've delivered it for a long time
[25:53] I respect this individual
[25:55] Hallelujah
[25:57] now what's the word character mean again
[25:59] here's character in the Greek it means
[26:01] approved
[26:03] so first you go through tests so you can
[26:05] be patient and then you have patience so
[26:07] you can be approved
[26:10] you can have a real character
[26:13] and then if you continue to grow in your
[26:15] character Paul says you'll end up in the
[26:18] state of hopefulness
[26:21] and here's what the Bible says or here's
[26:23] what the Lexicon says hope is
[26:24] expectation of good
[26:27] you expect something good to happen
[26:31] in the middle of inflation brother Jess
[26:32] in the middle of this political war in
[26:36] the middle of of the economy going down
[26:38] you can be hopeful yes you can praise
[26:40] God
[26:42] you can hope in Christ we don't know
[26:44] what the economy holds we don't know the
[26:45] future of that but we know who holds the
[26:47] future and we know Jesus Christ already
[26:50] won this battle that we're fighting we
[26:52] sang it on Sunday praise God
[26:54] we're fighting a battle he's already won
[26:56] church amen
[26:59] I like to change that song and say I
[27:01] know how the Bible ends
[27:02] Hallelujah we will be with him again
[27:06] hallelujah thank God Hallelujah
[27:10] so God wants to use four steps
[27:14] to give us an expectation of good now
[27:17] mostly most of you know Jeremiah 29 11.
[27:20] that's somebody's verse they just used
[27:22] recently can't remember we went to some
[27:24] event and that was their verse I thought
[27:25] that's a good event
[27:26] that's a good verse
[27:28] oh it was for your graduation yeah down
[27:31] in uh
[27:32] remember the name of that City
[27:34] Mount Vernon yeah there you go thank you
[27:37] for I know the thoughts that I think
[27:38] toward you saith the Lord thoughts of
[27:40] peace and not of evil to give you an
[27:43] expected end so what is what does God
[27:45] want us to have he wants us to have hope
[27:47] for the future
[27:48] other versions say I know the plans that
[27:50] I have for you
[27:53] now this is this scripture is so easy to
[27:56] quote brother Rand reads this in the
[27:57] message desperation he says isn't that
[27:59] sweet
[28:00] that's true church isn't it isn't this
[28:02] sweet
[28:03] but the sad part is most Christians fail
[28:06] to read the next two verses
[28:11] in other words everybody wants to know
[28:12] God's got me at the end
[28:15] if I die God's Got Me
[28:18] if anything bad happens I know Jesus
[28:20] going to be right there to help me out
[28:22] yeah everybody wants to know that but
[28:24] what about the next part
[28:28] then so that means after you know you
[28:31] have an expected end after you've got
[28:33] hope then you'll call on God and you
[28:36] shall go and pray unto me and I will
[28:38] hearken unto you and you shall seek me
[28:40] and find me when you search for me with
[28:42] all your heart
[28:44] amen everybody see what I'm talking
[28:46] about every every Church wants this but
[28:49] how many really seek God with all their
[28:51] heart
[28:52] like when it comes to the topic of
[28:53] homosexuality how many people when they
[28:55] answer that question how many preachers
[28:57] are they really going to the Bible to
[28:58] see what the Bible says
[29:00] are they just working with people's
[29:01] emotions well
[29:03] they're people just like us
[29:05] they deserve love just like everybody
[29:06] else
[29:08] well they they do they do believe love
[29:12] not letting them continue and not
[29:13] supporting their sin
[29:15] love would correct their sin right
[29:19] right
[29:20] everyone wants a good end but who wants
[29:22] to seek God
[29:24] church I remember I'm sure brother radio
[29:26] was like this too my wife and I and when
[29:28] we first came in this message all we did
[29:30] was listen to brother Brandon
[29:32] all right brother Ray
[29:34] all's I did was read the church age book
[29:36] that's all I did
[29:39] I wasn't on video games I wasn't at the
[29:41] movie theater
[29:43] didn't have apps at that time but
[29:46] wasn't it I wasn't reading the newspaper
[29:48] whatever I was always listening brother
[29:51] for him and always reading and Always
[29:53] setting that's all I did and church as I
[29:55] saw God I found God Amen
[29:59] and if you want hope if you weren't
[30:01] expected end you've got to seek God with
[30:03] all your heart praise God
[30:05] my wife can tell you that's why after we
[30:07] got married the day after we got married
[30:08] we didn't go on a honeymoon the death we
[30:10] got married we went to church today if
[30:11] we got married because I'm a seeking God
[30:12] with all my heart
[30:14] now that's we've laughed about that
[30:19] but it was just a sign of what was to
[30:21] come
[30:21] God knew I was going to be a pastor and
[30:25] she had pastor's wife God knew that
[30:27] but we we had already sought God with
[30:30] all of our hearts
[30:32] and people want our experience or our
[30:34] testimony or our whatever our life our
[30:36] time but have you saw God with all your
[30:38] heart praise God
[30:40] right each one of us have to look at
[30:42] that have we saw God with all of our
[30:44] hearts we all want God to have my back
[30:46] at the end we all want God to write me
[30:48] write me a great story God but how many
[30:51] of us are going to see God now praise
[30:52] God
[30:53] this is what the foolish version doesn't
[30:55] do they don't see God with all their
[30:57] heart for if they did Jesus would give
[30:59] him the Holy Ghost
[31:01] that's exactly right praise God
[31:06] see they just want to one verse they
[31:08] don't want the all they want to want all
[31:10] the verses about this
[31:12] Hallelujah
[31:18] like one summer I'll tell I was here on
[31:20] this brother Austin I think
[31:22] for a couple Summers as my first few
[31:24] years of teaching
[31:25] I painted for our school district
[31:28] so during the summer I didn't take the
[31:29] summer off I would just be painting all
[31:31] day it'd be a room like like any
[31:32] classroom I'd be taping up the walls you
[31:35] know and then I'd get the roller out
[31:37] and all day eight hours I got to listen
[31:39] to brother Brandon all day
[31:41] every day for two and a half months
[31:45] and Friends those words are still burned
[31:48] in my soul
[31:49] amen thank God Hallelujah brother Jose
[31:52] says all the time he said brother he
[31:53] looked up this quote and he's I find it
[31:55] like in a few seconds he's like how do
[31:56] you know that brother
[31:58] because God wrote it in my heart
[32:01] all those hours
[32:04] I'm like Glory I take a little break on
[32:06] my notepad right there I got to preach
[32:08] this one here we go
[32:11] I preach 125 sermons on just the Book of
[32:14] Revelation
[32:16] and seeing God do miracles in the midst
[32:18] of those
[32:19] see God answered prayers in the midst of
[32:21] those
[32:21] if you want hope if you want God to have
[32:24] your back at the end see God now
[32:26] Hallelujah with all you've got praise
[32:28] God
[32:31] that's what the Bible says seek God to
[32:33] seek the kingdom of God first God will
[32:35] give you everything else my wife and I
[32:37] are a witness of that
[32:39] like I was telling Austin Lena when we
[32:41] first got married we'd be packing peanut
[32:43] butter jellies every Sunday to church we
[32:45] behold Lydia eat peanut butter and jelly
[32:47] we didn't go out to eat at the beginning
[32:49] you know
[32:51] that's just how it was you know but we
[32:53] drove three hours to Lima or we drive an
[32:56] hour and a half up to Sheffield
[32:58] are they just support God's word with
[33:00] all we had
[33:01] listen to brother Rand the whole way
[33:03] there or songs all the way there and all
[33:05] the way back that's just you give
[33:06] yourself all to it praise God
[33:09] it's been the greatest blessing of Our
[33:11] Lives amen the peace on the word of God
[33:14] because it produces something it gives
[33:16] us patience it gives us character it
[33:18] gives us hope praise God
[33:20] amen
[33:22] so this is great for wise and foolish
[33:24] virgin all the all the verses want God
[33:27] to save them but who's willing to seek
[33:29] God with everything they got right now
[33:32] praise God
[33:35] now again this is Hope again but no
[33:37] notice hope seems to be a double
[33:39] confirmation of God's salvation what do
[33:41] you mean brother Jesse here's what I
[33:43] mean you remember years ago when I
[33:44] preached on the series on numerology
[33:46] I preached like 30 sermons on all the
[33:49] Bible numbers
[33:50] that was a great sir that was a great
[33:51] series at least for me I don't know
[33:53] about you
[33:54] brother random says the number four has
[33:57] lot at least three meanings he says it
[33:59] means Deliverance he says it could mean
[34:01] double confirmation and it's also an
[34:04] Earthly number
[34:05] I tell you it was a Deliverance for us
[34:07] when we got that house where we live at
[34:08] right now my wife and I made three
[34:10] offers on the house turned down all
[34:12] three on the last offer they accepted it
[34:15] praise God
[34:16] so number four snacks like that
[34:19] sometimes God's Works in numbers like
[34:21] that to give us deliverance from our
[34:23] situation we didn't what we had what
[34:25] probably four or five kids or four kids
[34:26] at that time three
[34:28] yeah three kids at that time run out of
[34:30] room God gave us a Deliverance of the
[34:32] house we're at now by God's grace
[34:34] just a small little testimony there with
[34:36] number four
[34:37] here's our brother random said two is a
[34:39] confirmation but four will confirm it
[34:42] it's a double confirmation
[34:45] so it seems uh two is like a testimony
[34:47] in four is like a double confirmation of
[34:49] the testimony
[34:52] now these are all the examples
[34:55] there's so many I don't have time to go
[34:56] through them all
[34:58] the prodigal son got four gifts right
[35:01] restoration or double confirmation he
[35:03] was back in the Covenant Bathsheba had
[35:05] four Sons double confirmation God had
[35:06] forgiven her sins
[35:09] the two Talent man got two more that's a
[35:12] double confirmation of his reward the
[35:13] Holy Ghost has four Witnesses double
[35:16] confirmation signs Miracles wonders and
[35:18] gifts
[35:20] four women were mentioned in Jesus's
[35:22] genealogy that's the double confirmation
[35:24] of how male and female are all one in
[35:26] Christ Jesus I preached this years ago
[35:27] so I'm not going to spend a lot of time
[35:28] with us
[35:30] um
[35:31] there's all kinds of force there's all
[35:33] kinds of force I'm just gonna I mean the
[35:34] rainbows mentioned four times double
[35:36] confirmation
[35:37] uh
[35:39] there's all kinds the four beasts for is
[35:43] an Earthly number there's earth air
[35:45] water fire there's north south east west
[35:47] there's four divisions of the day
[35:49] there's four night watches there's four
[35:50] great lunar phases you all I mean we
[35:52] went through this years ago
[35:55] four kinds of vessels they're four four
[35:57] crosses at Calvary there's four
[35:59] conditions you can end up in holy
[36:00] righteous filthy unjust there's four
[36:02] cherubims praise God not there's so many
[36:05] a lot see there's just all kinds of look
[36:07] at all these slides here I preach all
[36:09] these sermons back there
[36:10] but I like four as Deliverance also
[36:13] because at an idea receive Mercy because
[36:15] he grabbed the horns of the altar how
[36:17] many horns were there four
[36:19] job's first three friends were miserable
[36:22] comforters but his Forefront brought the
[36:24] victory praise God Amen well it was
[36:26] repentance it was a show job you got to
[36:29] repent and dust and Ashes praise God and
[36:31] then God was the fifth amen hallelujah
[36:35] Satan tries to imitate the four he's got
[36:37] four horse riders he's got four steps to
[36:40] death in James chapter one he's got four
[36:42] insects the four men had a vow to kill
[36:45] Paul's life to take Paul's life
[36:48] and Samson lied to Delilah three times
[36:50] but he revealed a secret at the fourth
[36:52] meeting leading to his blindness in
[36:54] slavery
[36:56] okay so I could go on and on Abraham
[36:58] defeated Four Kings to get lot back
[37:01] Israel leave Egypt in the fourth
[37:02] generation
[37:04] okay so see that number four There's
[37:06] Hope is the fourth step
[37:08] right tribulation patience character or
[37:11] experience and then hope
[37:14] so when we see a Christian I'll just use
[37:16] Brother Ray brother Raisman the message
[37:17] over 40 years
[37:19] and by God's grace we look at his life
[37:22] and we can see he has hope
[37:26] for the end of his life and for eternal
[37:28] life
[37:29] we don't look at Brother Ray and say
[37:30] he's hopeless why does he even come to
[37:32] church
[37:33] he's the one shouting and playing
[37:34] tambourine
[37:37] press testify and glorifying God he's
[37:39] that he's arrived at home amen he's got
[37:42] a double confirmation God has worked him
[37:45] through all the trials remember the
[37:46] brother who told me all those trials you
[37:47] went through remember that even with the
[37:49] churches there and the rain and all the
[37:51] trials you went through and alert you
[37:52] learning you growing as an individual
[37:54] those are tribulations but they produce
[37:57] patience and then it produces
[37:59] christ-like character and now brother
[38:01] has hope for the future praise God
[38:04] each one of us go through that and that
[38:07] hope is a double confirmation now you
[38:09] might call it a Deliverance that's fine
[38:10] but whatever it is that's where God's
[38:12] trying to get us to a place where we
[38:14] have hope in the Lord praise God and
[38:16] we're only going to get there by seeking
[38:18] God with all of our hearts
[38:21] amen amen
[38:23] if someone's in a hopeless Condition
[38:24] it's because they're not patient enough
[38:27] with God they're not letting God uh mold
[38:30] their character more like Christ because
[38:31] if they did that then they'd have hope
[38:36] and church sometimes sometimes people
[38:38] will blast hope hope hope you got to
[38:40] have faith well see that's in a
[38:41] different context
[38:43] that's in like let's say let's say let's
[38:45] say I'm sick yes in that case if I'm
[38:48] sick I want to have faith I want to have
[38:50] a revelation that I'm Healed
[38:52] right rather than just hope I hope I get
[38:54] healed right
[38:56] so you see what I mean people will blast
[38:58] hope and say like oh you got to have
[39:00] faith that's true for Divine Healing but
[39:02] just for a solid Christian Life
[39:05] just for a character I'll say like this
[39:07] mature character as a Christian hope is
[39:10] the Pinnacle that's what Paul says there
[39:12] a hopeful life a hopeful Christian Life
[39:15] is the Pinnacle because you've got
[39:16] character amen you've got patience and
[39:19] you have joy in your trials hallelujah
[39:21] thank God Amen
[39:23] Hallelujah
[39:26] but Brother Ray on the same token we
[39:28] wouldn't call names but how many message
[39:30] Believers that my wife knows to how many
[39:32] message Believers are hopeless and
[39:33] they've been sitting in churches for 20
[39:35] or 30 or 40 years
[39:38] they that's somewhere along in that
[39:40] four-step process Church let me go back
[39:42] to that
[39:43] somewhere in that four-step process they
[39:45] haven't allowed God to deal with them
[39:47] they weren't joyful in tribulations they
[39:50] were they were impatient with God
[39:53] or they took uh they didn't have the
[39:56] right character they didn't obey Jesus
[39:59] and so they didn't have the character of
[40:00] Christ
[40:02] and that's why some of these people
[40:03] leave the message after 30 or 40 years
[40:05] we've seen it right here in our church
[40:07] where's the hope
[40:10] and we found out later well they didn't
[40:11] have the character God was never number
[40:14] one in their life and the church said
[40:17] amen they wouldn't seek God with all
[40:19] their hearts they wouldn't say Amen they
[40:21] wouldn't come up to the altar repent
[40:22] they wouldn't they wouldn't pray for
[40:23] five minutes or ten minutes they
[40:25] wouldn't do nothing they just came to
[40:27] church coming to church is not the
[40:29] evidence hallelujah it's Christ in you
[40:31] is the evidence amen
[40:33] Jesus Christ Living in you is the
[40:36] evidence praise God
[40:38] we're learning that
[40:40] but it's more and more as time goes on
[40:42] we're learning that praise God
[40:45] so I don't have time to preach that
[40:46] sermon because I want to finish this
[40:48] thought here tonight
[40:50] so the Divine orders of force that
[40:52] process
[40:54] and it's to produce character right
[40:56] character and then hope but this hope
[40:58] also has this character because Jesus
[41:01] wants us to reign in this life
[41:04] he doesn't want us to be a slave to our
[41:07] sins he wants us to bring our sins into
[41:09] captivity
[41:11] that's the whole goal of Our Lives
[41:14] is to Reign Over sin to put sinful
[41:17] habits to stop sinful habits
[41:20] and to develop a Godly Christian
[41:22] character
[41:24] because Paul said if we suffer we shall
[41:27] also reign with him
[41:30] if we deny him he will deny us
[41:35] so
[41:37] let's remember
[41:39] Hallelujah there are scenes of dancing
[41:41] as we've been we did on Sunday right
[41:44] but then there's seasons of mourning
[41:47] and the scenes of mourning we could call
[41:48] a season of suffering
[41:51] see we God so suffering getting through
[41:54] suffering and becoming a better
[41:55] Christian actually probably produces
[41:58] better character than just if you dance
[41:59] every service
[42:01] right
[42:03] because that's the first step is
[42:04] tribulation and then that builds
[42:07] right patience
[42:09] now I wish dancing was in that four-step
[42:11] process
[42:14] who doesn't right don't you wish
[42:16] shouting was in there somewhere
[42:17] [Music]
[42:18] well I guess you know glory and
[42:20] tribulations I guess I guess it's built
[42:22] in there so at some point you rejoice in
[42:23] your child's day thank God this is
[42:24] producing a real christ-like character
[42:26] in me
[42:29] that's right
[42:30] suffering produces character that Jesus
[42:33] says is fit to rule
[42:37] now I want to read this again I haven't
[42:38] read this for a while it's a very famous
[42:40] quote but I want to read it just to
[42:42] remind you I know you'll be blessed by
[42:43] it
[42:44] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[42:46] reign with him
[42:48] so this is why Paul said we glory in our
[42:50] sufferings
[42:51] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[42:54] for this is that character simply is
[42:56] never made without suffering
[42:58] character is a victory not a gift I put
[43:01] that quote up when I was teaching third
[43:03] grade I put that quote up in my
[43:05] classroom above everything above the
[43:07] alphabet above I said character is a
[43:09] victory not a gift people would ask me
[43:11] say Mr Smith where'd you get that quote
[43:13] I said from God's Prophet brother
[43:14] Brandon who's he uh he was a prophet we
[43:17] follow him okay then they just move on
[43:21] but I wanted I might put it up this year
[43:23] maybe by God's grace and you're number
[43:24] 20 maybe I'll put it up there again
[43:26] but I just love that I had to remember
[43:28] I'm my whole battle here when I battle
[43:31] spirits in my classroom right
[43:34] nine and a half months out of the Year
[43:36] this is producing a character in me
[43:39] I want the children I went to principal
[43:40] I want the teachers to see Jesus Christ
[43:42] and me so do you and all your family
[43:44] your friends your church members your
[43:46] co-workers your your uh your your
[43:48] classmates you want them to see Christ
[43:51] in you
[43:55] character is a victory November
[43:56] character is the third step right on
[43:57] those four characters the third one
[43:59] that's experience
[44:01] a man without character can't Reign
[44:03] because power apart from character is
[44:06] satanic
[44:07] remember if they try to Reign their sins
[44:09] will find them out
[44:12] right but Power with character is fit to
[44:15] rule
[44:16] and since he wants us to share even his
[44:19] throne on the same basis that he
[44:21] overcome and is set down in his father's
[44:23] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[44:25] with him
[44:27] so Church let's have a fresh reminder
[44:28] you know you went through trials this
[44:30] week I went through trials this week we
[44:32] all go through trials this week but
[44:33] remember this is producing christ-like
[44:36] character
[44:37] this is producing something good you've
[44:40] got to go through this to get the
[44:42] patience and then character and then
[44:44] hope we've all got to go through it
[44:45] praise God
[44:49] the little temporary suffering we go
[44:52] through now is not worthy to be compared
[44:55] to the tremendous Glory that we will be
[44:58] revealed in us when he comes
[45:01] oh what Treasures are laid out for those
[45:03] who are willing to enter into his
[45:05] kingdom through much tribulation
[45:09] think about the millennium
[45:11] just The Treasure of you get to build
[45:13] houses and your children will live in
[45:15] those houses they'll never get kicked
[45:16] out
[45:17] their lease is a Thousand Years brother
[45:19] awesome
[45:20] when you build when you build a house of
[45:22] Millennium you got a lease for a
[45:23] thousand years
[45:25] right right the Bible said you'll build
[45:28] it you'll live in it and have it and
[45:30] nobody else will live in it praise God
[45:33] right
[45:34] and then you got some some of us will
[45:36] have rods of iron and will rule over
[45:38] five cities
[45:40] or maybe 10.
[45:42] maybe four or maybe three
[45:44] these are all rewards that sometimes we
[45:46] forget about but these are the treasures
[45:49] laid up how about a crowd remember uh
[45:52] remember the 420 Elders got crowns in
[45:54] heaven a wonderful where crowns are in
[45:55] the millennium
[45:57] how about that Pure White robe that
[46:00] righteousness of Jesus Christ amen
[46:02] hallelujah praise God these are
[46:05] Treasures
[46:07] that are laid up but it takes character
[46:09] in our lives in order to receive these
[46:12] Rewards
[46:13] and that comes through the four-step
[46:15] process
[46:18] and hope so hope is this final is this
[46:21] final condition we want to be in a
[46:23] hopeful Christian hope
[46:25] has no disappointments
[46:28] because the love of God is shed abroad
[46:30] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[46:32] given to us
[46:33] so hope doesn't get disappointed because
[46:36] you have God's love in your heart now I
[46:39] want to read this I thought this was
[46:40] inspired Hope Has No disappointments
[46:42] indwelling love or the baptism of the
[46:45] Holy Ghost produces hope no matter what
[46:47] God allows in our lives we will have no
[46:50] disappointments
[46:53] right that's what the Bible says hope is
[46:56] not ashamed
[46:59] well God I'm ashamed that you did this
[47:00] I'm God I'm ashamed of you no
[47:03] when you've reached mature hope you're
[47:05] hopeful there's no disappointments in
[47:07] life
[47:09] right
[47:10] now we may be disappointed with our
[47:12] mistakes
[47:14] but like Abraham God will make them all
[47:16] work for his glory
[47:21] I'm so disappointed
[47:24] uh you know that I I made this mistake
[47:27] in my life I'm so disappointed
[47:29] don't be
[47:32] learn from your mistake and then
[47:34] understand God will make this work for
[47:36] his glory
[47:39] you had to make that mistake so you
[47:40] learned the lesson you don't do it next
[47:42] time
[47:44] that's the purpose of it
[47:47] if you'd have been strong enough you
[47:48] wouldn't have fallen into that mistake
[47:51] to be a church isn't that beautiful I
[47:54] love this verse
[47:55] I read I was reading one of the
[47:57] commentaries and he and he said Hope Has
[47:58] No disappointments I'm like there it is
[48:00] and so then I wrote that after reading
[48:02] that
[48:03] once you reach this mature state of hope
[48:06] you're not disappointed with your life
[48:07] you know God's got it
[48:09] all right right you know God's in
[48:11] control
[48:12] you know God knew about this before the
[48:15] foundation of the world
[48:17] so I have nothing to be disappointed in
[48:20] right
[48:22] remember Stephen was stoned right and
[48:24] many you know even even as a man I feel
[48:26] bad he was the only I think he was 29.
[48:28] history says I thought man he could have
[48:30] had wife and children
[48:32] but think about the joy
[48:35] of seeing Jesus stand to receive and the
[48:37] Bible said Jesus was standing
[48:39] when Philip was I'm sorry when Stephen
[48:41] was crossing over into heaven
[48:43] do you think he'd want to leave Jesus
[48:45] and come back and say well I'd rather
[48:46] start a family and I'll start a business
[48:48] actually
[48:49] you know no no there's no
[48:52] disappointments
[48:53] so if you die a martyr or if you die in
[48:55] a car crash or you know whatever you
[48:58] would however you die like there's no
[48:59] disappointments because you've got the
[49:01] love of God in your heart you know you
[49:02] love God God loves you and God wouldn't
[49:04] let anything happen unless it would work
[49:06] for his glory praise God
[49:08] oh that's beautiful praise God
[49:11] amen
[49:13] you think Stephen would say no Jesus
[49:15] you're you're very glorious but I would
[49:17] like to go back to the Earth
[49:19] that's like hope when hope died right by
[49:21] the ram called that spear back as a
[49:23] prophet and she said why'd you call me
[49:25] back
[49:26] it was so beautiful
[49:29] right
[49:32] there's no disappointments and she died
[49:34] at a young mother and she had
[49:36] she had Little Billy Paul was it what
[49:38] year and a half
[49:40] and she's even with a year and a half
[49:41] vote no Channel that's hard for mothers
[49:43] right that's hard even for dads to
[49:44] understand
[49:47] when the love of God is in your heart
[49:49] there's no disappointment because God is
[49:52] going to take care of it
[49:53] remember that verse earlier Jeremiah 29
[49:55] 11.
[49:57] God loves me he's got plans for me he
[50:00] has an expected end for my life in other
[50:02] words God has already written this story
[50:04] God already wrote The End Of My Life
[50:09] Hope Has No disappointments
[50:12] the church so when we can be mature and
[50:14] live in the hope of God there's no
[50:16] there's no disappointments in our life
[50:19] oh I didn't get in that college I wanted
[50:22] I didn't get that
[50:23] uh I didn't get that uh promotion I
[50:26] wanted
[50:27] I didn't get this that I went I didn't
[50:28] get that house that I wanted that
[50:36] well if we look at God's if we look at
[50:38] God's word and God's plan the Bible said
[50:40] God has a plan for us amen and it must
[50:43] not be in the plan of God and either way
[50:46] God's not done with me he's going to
[50:47] work on me and he's going to help me to
[50:49] see 2020 Vision that's a good thing that
[50:52] didn't happen because it's producing
[50:53] character in my life
[50:56] Hallelujah
[50:58] so see church this proves love is the
[51:00] greatest force in the universe this
[51:01] proves it right here
[51:02] no matter what God allows to happen in
[51:04] my life I won't be ashamed I won't be
[51:07] disappointed because God's love is in my
[51:09] heart
[51:10] I know God loves me and I love God Amen
[51:16] I love God and God loves me
[51:20] that's how I know
[51:22] because all things work together for
[51:24] God's for God's glory
[51:26] everything will work together for good
[51:28] Now give me 10 minutes here there's my
[51:30] timer give me 10 more minutes I'll try
[51:31] to close by eight o'clock
[51:34] let's read this again it's so beautiful
[51:36] and we know do we know
[51:44] sometimes we forget them here but thank
[51:46] God we know down in here praise God
[51:48] hallelujah
[51:50] thank you Jesus amen
[51:52] we think a lot of things we shouldn't
[51:54] think right but we know in our soul
[51:57] all things work together for good
[52:00] I think about like this what if Tim
[52:02] Myers would have stayed here as pastor
[52:05] I wouldn't have been the pastor
[52:07] which you might say Amen
[52:09] hopefully you
[52:11] me being pastor
[52:13] but I think my whole life could be
[52:15] different and look where look what the
[52:16] decisions our brothers made you know
[52:17] which is he's allowed to make whatever
[52:19] decisions he wants
[52:20] but I can look back and see look at the
[52:23] time it was hard to see him move down
[52:24] North Carolina but now I can look back
[52:26] and say all things work together for
[52:28] good to them
[52:31] and I was the first pastor and the only
[52:33] Pastor so far at this church now God can
[52:35] do whatever he wants but like that song
[52:37] says look where I'm standing now sister
[52:39] who remember that one look where I'm
[52:41] standing now amen look where we're
[52:43] standing in Christ Hallelujah we got the
[52:45] word we got the Revelation the word we
[52:48] got the truth we got God's blessings on
[52:50] our lives we got Souls being saved we
[52:52] got Souls that come back praise God
[52:53] we've got Souls that are staying we got
[52:55] new souls and the main thing is our
[52:57] souls our servant Jesus Christ
[52:59] hallelujah amen and he's producing his
[53:01] character in our lives he's building up
[53:03] hope in our lives
[53:05] all things work together for good to
[53:07] them that love God
[53:10] to them who are called according to his
[53:12] purpose it's a great one with Lena too
[53:13] like Austin not left where would Lena be
[53:17] like she don't even want to think where
[53:18] she wants to be neither would I want to
[53:20] where neither would I want to think
[53:21] where where would I be if Simon didn't
[53:22] come share a serpent seat with me
[53:25] where would I be
[53:28] yeah I'd probably be at the chapel like
[53:30] my other friends were
[53:32] which
[53:33] not necessarily is a bad place but it
[53:34] sure isn't the full word of God
[53:37] I want to be in the forward of God
[53:39] amen thank God
[53:44] what if I would not have got hurt on
[53:46] football what if I would have made the
[53:47] NFL where would I be now
[53:52] think about that
[53:54] I'm I can look back and see all things
[53:56] work together for good
[53:58] to them that love God
[54:00] to them who are called according to his
[54:03] purpose
[54:04] so see we want to remember our lives are
[54:06] for his purpose not for our wants
[54:09] my life is not about what I want to
[54:12] achieve or what I want my life is about
[54:14] saying just like Jesus prayed father let
[54:17] your will be done not my will praise God
[54:20] and then help me to accept your purpose
[54:22] and help me to live for your purpose
[54:25] what's your purpose that's the great
[54:27] question
[54:29] what is God's purpose for my life
[54:32] now if you can find that then you can be
[54:34] happy
[54:35] and you can have hope Lord what is your
[54:38] purpose for my life don't you love this
[54:40] book of Romans my goodness
[54:42] I've got numerous people feedbacks and
[54:44] I'm really liking this series I'm like
[54:45] me too
[54:47] thank God Hallelujah
[54:49] Church like I read those quotes on
[54:50] Sunday brother said the Holy Ghost will
[54:53] never point you to anything else except
[54:54] the word of God
[54:57] and so when we when we preach on the
[54:59] book of the Bible we get overtime Holy
[55:02] Ghost pointing us to the word I mean
[55:03] it's overtime
[55:05] some people just preach all programmed
[55:07] stories that's fine and that's okay
[55:10] if it points you to the
[55:12] to them if we're just in the Bible all
[55:13] the Bible and then bringing in small
[55:15] little stories here and there like I did
[55:16] on Sunday remember the remember the the
[55:18] cult story on Sunday
[55:20] Hallelujah
[55:24] but if we're just in the I mean the more
[55:26] we're in the word and letting the word
[55:28] change us then the more we can say the
[55:30] Holy Ghost is pointing us to the word
[55:31] the more we're Guided by the Holy Ghost
[55:34] because we're pointing to God's word
[55:35] hallelujah
[55:39] so all things work together for good for
[55:42] your life because he foreknew you and he
[55:45] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[55:47] image of his son so all your sufferings
[55:49] are producing a christ-like character
[55:55] that he might be the firstborn among
[55:57] many Brethren but what is one of those
[55:59] what's the first component suffering
[56:02] tribulation
[56:04] got to go through trials got to go
[56:06] through tests where you feel like giving
[56:08] up or you feel like it's really
[56:09] difficult or you're between a rock and a
[56:11] hard place you got to go through those
[56:13] in order to gain more patience with God
[56:17] doesn't want spoiled brats
[56:20] like God I got a problem
[56:23] I'm going to take out my faith and I'm
[56:25] going to solve this problem every time
[56:27] now there's no more problems I don't
[56:29] want to spoil brat like that
[56:32] God wants a patient child
[56:34] like the children ask me daddy when are
[56:36] we going to have a we're gonna have a
[56:37] perfect bar
[56:38] you know we're going to have a perfect
[56:40] bar yesterday I said no gotta wait till
[56:42] tomorrow night after church
[56:45] well see they got patience because they
[56:47] didn't throw a fit well Zion might have
[56:49] threw a little bit of fitment
[56:50] he's only two you know is he sleeping
[56:53] now
[56:55] everybody else like oh yeah I can wait
[56:56] because I've got patience
[56:59] not so much on Zion all the time
[57:02] that in church that's how we are right
[57:04] we want it now now now now
[57:06] let's not be impatient
[57:09] let's be patient
[57:13] that he might and he was the firstborn
[57:15] the Holy Ghost came down from heaven and
[57:17] uh anointed his soul and that means all
[57:21] the rest of the Saints are going to have
[57:22] that birthing of the Soul because he was
[57:24] the firstborn
[57:27] okay I'm almost out of time here um
[57:30] let me see uh
[57:38] let me uh let me close to this and I'm
[57:40] going to tell a little story here okay
[57:43] so church have you noticed with this
[57:44] little series here
[57:46] um
[57:50] you know all the history says Paul was
[57:51] solving the problem between these Jews
[57:53] these legalistic Jews and these Gentiles
[57:55] that didn't know the law
[57:56] and he was trying he's trying to find a
[57:58] common place for them all to gather
[58:01] so he first had to show them you're all
[58:03] Sinners you're all desperately in need
[58:05] of a savior you're all lost you've all
[58:07] fallen short of the glory of God
[58:10] he said but then just like Abraham if
[58:13] you believe on God without works God
[58:15] will give you his righteousness if you
[58:16] just repent and then he goes through
[58:18] this chapter here now you have peace
[58:20] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[58:25] in other words God Paul's trying to show
[58:27] how do I get these legalists to get out
[58:28] of their legalism how to get these
[58:30] Sinners these sin lovers to to find
[58:32] peace with God and he said this is the
[58:35] answer you're all Sinners you all need
[58:36] the cross of Jesus Christ
[58:39] This Is The Answer amen hallelujah
[58:42] praise God in other words you all need
[58:43] to repent your sins uh give me baptized
[58:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ get
[58:47] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[58:49] Ghost and now you can serve God
[58:52] they were trying to avoid God in their
[58:54] sins and then the Gentiles and the Jews
[58:56] are trying to please God with legalism
[58:58] right and church Simon preached a good
[58:59] thought Malachi you might have heard it
[59:03] you know the law was a Schoolmaster to
[59:05] bring us to Christ
[59:07] and Simon brought this thought out it
[59:08] was very good on Sunday at his home
[59:10] Church
[59:11] in the law you had to circumcise A boy
[59:14] eight days after he was born well all
[59:17] the time that Eighth Day fell on a
[59:19] Sabbath day
[59:21] and no one's supposed to work on a
[59:23] Sabbath day
[59:25] it was against the law to do any work on
[59:27] the Sabbath
[59:29] Sabbath but every Sabbath guess what the
[59:31] priest had to get there and they had to
[59:32] do the surgery and circumcise and do the
[59:35] works
[59:37] in other words God's law was set up with
[59:39] 613 Commandments it was set up where
[59:42] you're going to see some of them I have
[59:43] to break some of them in other words to
[59:45] fulfill other ones
[59:47] in other words I can't keep all the law
[59:50] I don't have the ability to keep all the
[59:53] law of God because there are so many
[59:54] laws that was teaching us I can't do it
[59:57] on my own I need Grace
[59:59] Hallelujah I need I need God's
[1:00:02] righteousness I can't do it on myself I
[1:00:04] need the righteousness of God and the
[1:00:06] only way I can get that is through a
[1:00:08] free gift of God Amen
[1:00:10] I love that it's just a beautiful
[1:00:12] thought
[1:00:12] just like the priests
[1:00:16] every Sabbath they had to sacrifice
[1:00:18] animals do circumcision even Jesus said
[1:00:21] they'd blaspheme the Sabbath
[1:00:24] but yet they were called to do it
[1:00:27] right and it was a school master
[1:00:29] to point us to Christ
[1:00:32] Hallelujah that we can't do it on our
[1:00:34] own no matter how hard we try we've got
[1:00:36] to trust God we've got to accept God's
[1:00:39] God's gift
[1:00:40] so hard for Americans to accept gifts
[1:00:44] like it's even hard for me to ask for
[1:00:45] help like our mower broke
[1:00:47] and so we have you know we have almost
[1:00:49] an acre so I'm out there I spent about
[1:00:51] four hours out there with my weed eater
[1:00:52] trying to mow the grass because I'm too
[1:00:55] proud to go ask my neighbor can I borrow
[1:00:57] your lawnmower
[1:00:59] now that's just me
[1:01:02] I'd rather sit out there and waste all
[1:01:03] those hours because I'm just I don't
[1:01:05] want to borrow somebody's lawnmower I
[1:01:06] don't want to I don't want to lean on
[1:01:08] somebody else now in hindsight I should
[1:01:10] have called a lawn mowing company
[1:01:13] and they should have mowed my lawn that
[1:01:14] would have been a much better use of my
[1:01:15] time and money
[1:01:17] but now I got hindsight in case my
[1:01:18] lawnmower breaks down again
[1:01:20] but that's just how we are right we
[1:01:21] don't want to accept a free gift but
[1:01:22] with Jesus you have to accept a free
[1:01:25] gift amen you have to accept the free
[1:01:27] gift praise God and you've got to
[1:01:29] rejoice in his gift and you got to just
[1:01:31] trust it trust in the word of God
[1:01:33] because God's word cannot fail praise
[1:01:35] God
[1:01:38] and so what do brother Rams say
[1:01:39] that's what I love about the book of
[1:01:41] Romans now brother Raymond ends at
[1:01:43] church age with this quote not for one
[1:01:45] moment do I bring a message to the
[1:01:47] people that they may follow me or join
[1:01:49] my church or start some fellowship in
[1:01:51] organization I've never done that and
[1:01:53] will not do that now
[1:01:55] I have no interest in those things but I
[1:01:57] have an interest in the things of God
[1:01:58] and people
[1:02:00] I'm gonna stop right there brother
[1:02:01] Brandon moved out to Arizona in January
[1:02:04] of 1963.
[1:02:06] and he didn't start a church
[1:02:08] he could have
[1:02:11] all the people would have flocked to his
[1:02:12] church
[1:02:14] but he didn't and so see Church his life
[1:02:16] proves these words are right
[1:02:18] that's what I love about brother Brandon
[1:02:20] he was totally transparent
[1:02:22] his life backs up these words
[1:02:25] and then you know and then right before
[1:02:27] he passes the Holy Spirit tells him you
[1:02:29] know my family needs a home church so
[1:02:31] brother Perry green started Church
[1:02:34] I don't know how long his family went
[1:02:35] there
[1:02:37] but they should have kept going
[1:02:40] because that's what brother I said this
[1:02:41] to you brother I said this is my home
[1:02:42] church now the Tucson Tabernacles on
[1:02:44] tape you can hear it
[1:02:47] brother bam said now what did Brother
[1:02:48] Brandon want to accomplish Church
[1:02:52] he said if I can accomplish just one
[1:02:54] thing I'll be Satisfied the one thing is
[1:02:56] to see establish a true spiritual
[1:02:58] relationship between God and man
[1:03:01] where men become new creatures in Christ
[1:03:04] filled with the spirit and live
[1:03:06] according to his word
[1:03:07] I would invite plead and warn all to
[1:03:10] hear his voice at this time and yield
[1:03:12] your lives completely to him even as I
[1:03:14] trust in my heart that I've given my all
[1:03:16] to him God bless you and may his coming
[1:03:18] Rejoice your heart
[1:03:20] that's to me what the book of Romans is
[1:03:22] all about
[1:03:24] it brings a true relationship between
[1:03:26] God and man we're all sinners none of us
[1:03:29] could keep the law
[1:03:31] uh and others were just running after
[1:03:33] sins you know the only place where we
[1:03:35] can find peace is in the Lord Jesus
[1:03:38] Christ
[1:03:39] therefore
[1:03:40] being justified by faith we have peace
[1:03:43] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:46] let's stand to our feet musicians can
[1:03:48] come stop the live stream I'm gonna
[1:03:49] share one more story about the peace of
[1:03:51] God
