[36:41] here I'll be out of town reaching for
[36:43] brother can and then doing a 40th
[36:45] wedding anniversary I don't know
[36:47] yes I'm oh and like still looking
[36:51] thank you appreciate that how could I
[36:56] forget that
[36:59] so yeah next week but I'm at Lightner
[37:01] we'll be here looking forward to that
[37:02] but I'll be out
[37:03] it's brother Brooks and his wife I don't
[37:06] know if I should say it over life you're
[37:07] my doubt they listen to my sermons but
[37:08] but we're gonna renew their vows next
[37:11] Friday in Lima it's a surprise to his
[37:15] wife so oh I doubt she listens to our
[37:18] sermons in it
[37:19] if she does boy am I in trouble I don't
[37:26] think she listed services so praise the
[37:29] Lord and I apologize if I if I made a
[37:33] mistake there so that's why I'm out you
[37:36] know it kind of worked out there's lots
[37:37] of different things going on so we had
[37:41] had to do that so let's look at purpose
[37:45] again tonight you know it was
[37:47] interesting you know I was out there
[37:49] talking to sister Brendan after service
[37:50] and the Lord's really done a great
[37:53] revival in her life since she started
[37:54] coming to church here and if you're not
[37:56] sure about just ask her about it she'll
[37:58] tell you God has done a great thing and
[38:00] anyways I was asking you know I was
[38:02] talking to out there and you know she
[38:03] just said during service this morning
[38:05] that you know Satan was saying you have
[38:06] no purpose you have no purpose and she
[38:09] said the Holy Spirit just rose up in her
[38:10] and said yes I do have a purpose you
[38:12] know and then she said I heard things
[38:14] this morning I've never heard in all my
[38:15] life you know and so so God was really
[38:18] speaking to her and helping her and so
[38:21] that was just an encouragement to keep
[38:23] in mind that you know Satan wants us to
[38:25] feel like we have no purpose he wants to
[38:27] take all of our hope but we have a
[38:30] Living Hope the Bible says we have a
[38:33] lively hope and there's one thing that
[38:35] we should never do is become hopeless
[38:38] because Jesus Christ is a Living Hope
[38:40] for us
[38:41] and so you know I look at I look at our
[38:43] dear sister you know and uh with Brenda
[38:46] and God has really redeemed her life God
[38:48] has done a tremendous thing in her life
[38:50] and so just be encouraged you know God
[38:52] has done great things for her and God is
[38:55] still encouraging her that every every
[38:57] part of life is a season and that's what
[39:00] the scripture that's what these first
[39:02] verses first eight verses tell us about
[39:05] that
[39:06] about there's a time and season for
[39:08] everything praise God there's a purpose
[39:10] under heaven for everything and then
[39:13] don't forget this I always pray this
[39:15] verse but verse 11 he's made everything
[39:18] he hath made everything beautiful in his
[39:19] time also he has set the world in their
[39:23] hearts so that no man can find out the
[39:26] work that God maketh from the beginning
[39:28] to the end right we can't figure it out
[39:31] on everything he hides that so then we
[39:34] can have all eternity he can review all
[39:35] that his plan and purpose for everything
[39:38] you know we can see that so I want to
[39:43] just review here you can switch over
[39:44] lady I do have some some quotes here I
[39:49] want to share and since we got our
[39:52] visitors here I think I'll just quickly
[39:53] review what what the seasons are that
[39:58] we've been going over if I can just find
[40:00] them real quick real briefly here okay
[40:03] thank you so just real quick you know
[40:06] solomon lists 14 opposites and
[40:09] complementary seasons in Ecclesiastes 13
[40:13] I'm sorry Calise a series 3 rather and
[40:16] it's a it's really 14 but then there's a
[40:19] pair for each of the 14 which makes 28
[40:22] and then 28 is the number of days in a
[40:25] lunar cycle for the moon and the moon
[40:27] types the bride you know and then a
[40:31] woman has a cycle for 28 days so those
[40:35] are the two 28 that we can find in
[40:36] scripture I'm sure there's more but
[40:39] those are the ones we found so it speaks
[40:41] of life you know speaks of Hope and it
[40:43] speaks of you know cycles and seasons
[40:45] and that's what the Bible says so we've
[40:48] been looking at each one and and really
[40:50] what I've done in this message I've just
[40:51] with this series I've just taken
[40:53] inspiration like brother man taught go
[40:54] back to the concordance
[40:55] and I've searched out every word in the
[40:58] concordance there and so we can see
[41:01] there's a with borning born and being
[41:03] born and dying there there's the
[41:05] physical birth and death like brother
[41:06] branham born and died and we're
[41:09] appointed times to live the Bible said
[41:10] but then there's spiritual that that's
[41:12] also spiritual when you're born again is
[41:15] when you finally die out to yourself so
[41:17] it works out really good
[41:18] you know that with natural planting and
[41:21] plucking up that's like spring and fall
[41:22] but then there's spiritual times the
[41:25] Bible said we must plant and water but
[41:27] God gives the increase and then in
[41:29] Israel you know would be plucked up and
[41:31] planted you know back in the promised
[41:32] land and then within the natural God
[41:38] takes lives he spares lives there's
[41:40] medicine that kills and heals and then
[41:43] in the spiritual we must kill evil
[41:44] influences and healing begins and church
[41:47] problems are called like killing the
[41:49] Bible said in James chapter 4 so church
[41:53] fights are like killing people you know
[41:55] and sadly that's what people do they
[41:57] kill people's influence and that's a
[42:00] very sad thing to see but we don't want
[42:02] to do that but there are seasons we have
[42:04] to battle that have to overcome that
[42:06] then there are seasons of breaking down
[42:08] and building up in the natural like this
[42:10] the the the Temple in Jerusalem but in
[42:12] the spiritual we must build up
[42:15] strongholds of faith but also there's
[42:19] breaking down of strongholds which are
[42:21] complexes so there are seasons where
[42:23] they get built up but then they get torn
[42:25] down thank God for that there's seasons
[42:28] of weeping and laughing like in the
[42:29] natural you you're sad and then you're
[42:31] drooling full but in the spiritual like
[42:35] the weeping seasons our desperation
[42:37] where he crowd to God and the laughter
[42:39] seasons are the times when God answers
[42:40] the prayer thank the Lord praise God and
[42:43] then they're seen as a mourning which is
[42:45] like funerals and dancing or like it
[42:47] weddings but then there's scenes of
[42:50] ministry whether it's it's morning is
[42:52] like fasting and praying the Bible says
[42:55] that in Matthew chapter 11 Jesus's
[42:57] ministry was like a dancing ministry
[42:59] because Jesus said you know he said
[43:02] you're Mourning you know during John the
[43:04] Baptist ministry but then my ministry is
[43:06] like piping and dancing he's
[43:08] and so those are scenes of victory again
[43:10] after more so thank God for those and
[43:14] then casting yea casting and gathering
[43:18] stones was like building and tearing
[43:21] down physical structures but then the
[43:23] spirituals like restoring worship praise
[43:27] God so we saw that with Elijah restoring
[43:31] the altar you know he's restoring
[43:32] worship that's when we gather stones
[43:35] together gather revelations right and
[43:37] you you rece rebuild your worship you
[43:40] restore your worship praise God so now
[43:43] we'll go back up there to the eighth one
[43:45] I believe from last time let me just
[43:47] find that one real briefly and I just
[43:53] want everybody to see how scriptural
[43:54] that is because it's very scriptural way
[43:58] out tonight what I do with it
[44:00] oh here it is so the eighth one was a
[44:03] really good one - he's really plainly
[44:05] seen in Scripture there's a time to
[44:08] embrace and then a time to refrain from
[44:10] embracing you can see that in the
[44:12] natural with a husband and wife you know
[44:13] the Bible says they shouldn't come
[44:15] together if they're gonna pray you know
[44:17] and fast also with divided family
[44:20] members and church order issues there's
[44:22] times you know not to embrace if
[44:25] someone's preaching a false doctrine you
[44:26] know you don't let them in your house
[44:27] you don't embrace them you don't wish
[44:28] them Godspeed
[44:30] but then the spiritual there's a time to
[44:32] embrace wisdom right but there's times
[44:36] we're tempted to refrain from embracing
[44:38] the word right maybe we embrace you know
[44:41] things of the world too much we should
[44:43] be embracing God's wisdom so that just
[44:47] kind of catches you up real fast on the
[44:50] 22 previous sermons on this subject so
[44:52] we've been looking at that but let's
[44:54] look at I just want to read a few quotes
[44:56] I know this is really small so forgive
[44:58] me but brother Graham says I'm gonna
[45:00] skip down here times sake well Graham
[45:04] said you always have to stand this
[45:05] reproach in order to give your testing
[45:07] to see every man that comes to Christ
[45:09] must first be trial chain or child train
[45:12] rather for the purpose that God has
[45:14] ordained you for and remember if you can
[45:18] just keep quiet he says
[45:20] and that's striking if you and I can
[45:22] just keep quiet in our suffering and not
[45:25] complain right because that's not so
[45:26] separated job from other people right
[45:28] job didn't charge God foolishly when he
[45:31] was tested right the three the three
[45:34] friends they you know they all said
[45:36] wrong things but job never say anything
[45:38] wrong he never charged God foolishly
[45:41] brother and said you can just keep quiet
[45:44] remember if he's called you for this
[45:46] whatever God's called you for there's
[45:49] nothing can keep it from happening
[45:51] there's not enough Devils and torment
[45:53] but what God's word will be made
[45:55] manifest you're born for a purpose and
[45:58] nobody can take your place a man I'll
[46:01] give you some hope tonight right nobody
[46:03] can take your place so you might have
[46:06] impersonators everything else but
[46:08] they'll never take your place right
[46:10] God's Word will triumph it cannot fail
[46:12] there's where every Christian ought to
[46:14] stand knowing that the trials will come
[46:17] up and seem every way to you but
[46:20] remember God has a purpose it will all
[46:22] work out right now just look at my spot
[46:26] just for a moment let's say I never
[46:28] woulda came to Akron you know would
[46:32] there have been a church here I well God
[46:34] could have worked outside of that he
[46:35] could have raised up a church but what
[46:37] if I would have not take my place in my
[46:38] position see nobody can take my place
[46:42] right you to think about you and think
[46:46] about this you know the Bible said if
[46:49] there's no generation you have to you
[46:51] and I have to leave footsteps on the
[46:52] sands of time you know we don't know how
[46:55] long God's gonna tear like I said on
[46:56] Wednesday night
[46:57] God could come next year but God could
[46:59] come in a hundred years - we always have
[47:01] to live by confessing all of our sin and
[47:04] that makes us ready for the coming as
[47:08] long as I'm confessing out all the sin
[47:09] getting everything out of my heart and
[47:11] making sure I'm pure with God if I'm
[47:13] born again I'm always ready for the
[47:14] coming of the Lord but let's say God
[47:17] Terry's let's say let's say a hundred
[47:19] more years then we have a we are then
[47:22] our purpose is this God's ordained us to
[47:25] leave footprints for the next generation
[47:28] for little nature to raise up there you
[47:30] know virtue it'll eat in
[47:33] Genevieve you know Lily and James you
[47:37] know we got to leave footprints here for
[47:38] the next generation and so at the very
[47:42] minimum you should see that your purpose
[47:44] is to leave godly footprints on the
[47:47] sands of time
[47:48] praise God if God terry's but if not let
[47:54] me say like this too if not your
[47:56] footprints will lead up in the rapture
[47:58] right and then whoever's left will see
[48:01] your footprints and it may encourage
[48:04] your family members or foolish virgin
[48:06] whatever it is whoever doesn't go in the
[48:08] rapture your footprints left here after
[48:10] the rapture may encourage them get saved
[48:12] right and now we know the only way to be
[48:17] saved then is to give your life as a
[48:18] martyr to not take the mark of the beast
[48:21] but see even that your you have a place
[48:25] God's ordained you for a purpose and
[48:28] like I was telling sister Brenda a
[48:29] church he's been through some things but
[48:32] I told her I said she said you know
[48:34] she's bad with her purpose I looked at
[48:35] her and I said sister God has at least
[48:38] your very least of your purpose is to be
[48:40] a witness on the day of judgement for
[48:42] all those people that have experienced
[48:45] what you have but you've chosen not to
[48:47] be upset with God and you've chosen to
[48:49] take his word and rise above it amen
[48:52] praise God if the Queen if God was gonna
[48:55] raise up the Queen of Sheba all because
[48:58] of the mic she crossed the desert she
[49:00] cuz she want to know the truth of God
[49:02] how much more some of us who've gone
[49:04] through awful terrible trials in order
[49:06] got out so he could use us on the day of
[49:09] judgment amen
[49:10] as the witness that we're believers amen
[49:13] that's a very least the member garnet
[49:17] peak God let him get polio and die but
[49:20] still get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:21] of 15 years old for two years no Ram
[49:24] said because I'm the damn judgment his
[49:26] witness would witness against that
[49:27] entire community amen
[49:30] God's gotta have a witness amen he's got
[49:33] to have a witness in Akron praise God a
[49:35] witness in your family a witness on your
[49:37] job God's got to have a witness so at
[49:40] the very least remember God has ordained
[49:43] you for that purpose
[49:45] and don't get discouraged he said just
[49:48] keep fighting just don't complain
[49:51] brother bang no no actually you need to
[49:53] say that to me don't complain mother
[49:56] Jessie don't complain because God has a
[49:58] purpose I'm just using him as an example
[49:59] he doesn't complain but I'm just using
[50:01] them as example we got to remind each
[50:03] other not to complain God helped me I
[50:06] don't want to complain I'm just laying a
[50:08] few quotes in here just to encourage you
[50:11] because memory even your life brother
[50:13] Ram says your life is just a season see
[50:16] you today that gives us a great
[50:17] testimony witness of God of creation
[50:19] that when we are in the season of mortal
[50:21] life raising your children marrying and
[50:24] bringing forth families this is a life
[50:26] or the season of mortal life this is
[50:29] just a season glory this time on earth
[50:34] is just a season we get a new body we
[50:36] get a new season amen oh that's gonna be
[50:39] a glorious summer day glorious season
[50:43] amen yes we get older we come down to
[50:46] the winter right I guess I guess eternal
[50:49] life would be a spring season then the
[50:52] new body would be the spring right
[50:54] because that's in the resurrection was
[50:55] in the spring so sorry now he talked
[50:58] about Edith right now either but this
[50:59] just changing he said every seven years
[51:01] your life changes so seven times seven
[51:05] you see it makes it kind of hard there's
[51:07] a complete change and it bothers the
[51:09] women nice talking about when you get to
[51:11] fifty here
[51:12] 49 you know seven times seven is
[51:13] forty-nine fifty you start he said
[51:15] change in your time of life men usually
[51:17] get a kind of a funny carrying on during
[51:19] that time and sometimes leave their
[51:21] wives but women are unfertile after that
[51:23] and then we all go through that we must
[51:25] remember that it's things that we must
[51:27] bear with one another and understand
[51:30] those things so you know every seven
[51:34] years I don't know if that's everybody
[51:36] but I was just thinking about that a
[51:38] little bit you know because really once
[51:43] you turn 34 you've actually started now
[51:45] you start your 35th year right yes
[51:50] because when you turn
[51:52] one you've already had one complete year
[51:53] and now you're starting your second year
[51:56] so I was thinking about what happened
[51:58] when I was 34 brother Amen came in the
[52:01] church see God knows something great
[52:06] every seven years it was I went back
[52:12] inject so I you know my next one is 42
[52:16] so I'm coming up on 13 almost be 39
[52:18] pretty soon here so I just thought that
[52:20] was interesting you know I just thank
[52:25] the Lord for His mercy sewed up back to
[52:28] brother branham he said I've been a
[52:29] neurotic all my life as a little boy
[52:30] there was something struck me that scare
[52:32] me about every seven years who had
[52:33] happen to me the jack remembers come off
[52:36] the field something just happened and
[52:37] that was he now look not only did his
[52:39] stomach get sour but he said mental
[52:42] oppression and he said you don't know
[52:45] what I've suffered just mental
[52:47] oppression every seven years it's come
[52:50] all my life that's where I'm at now
[52:52] seven eight so 56 so this is on the
[52:57] wings of a snow white dove this and
[52:59] testified that that squirrel died you
[53:01] know that the demonic squirrel looking
[53:03] thing it came out it died but I just
[53:07] want to show you this it wasn't just the
[53:08] natural but it was the spiritual as well
[53:12] God let him suffer every seven years but
[53:16] then God brought the victory okay so I
[53:21] just want to bring these out just this
[53:23] just to encourage you know no matter
[53:25] where you are you look to God for
[53:27] victory it's a season right you look
[53:32] through the season praise God there
[53:34] there'll be an end to that season
[53:35] hallelujah now I didn't get to that one
[53:39] but there's a quote about cycle and
[53:40] death I didn't get to that one so I'm
[53:41] gonna preach on that in the future let
[53:43] me do it just a couple more now this was
[53:45] right after brother Branham got through
[53:47] the season of being interviewed by the
[53:49] FBI I'm sorry the IRS remember he was he
[53:55] had all those tax cases but I like this
[53:58] because it shows brother Branham was
[53:59] looking forward to revival I'm looking
[54:01] for this week to revival in my own soul
[54:03] I told my wife yesterday when I'd heard
[54:05] some
[54:05] News and rushed over there through my
[54:06] arms router and screamed now I'm free
[54:08] see the IRS had told him he only had to
[54:10] pay $40,000 and brother Dow was gonna
[54:12] pay for it cuz he was a millionaire so
[54:14] God sent a millionaire in the profits
[54:16] Church to pay for this fee he could
[54:18] never pay for it Satan thought oh I'll
[54:21] get him with forty thousand dollars so
[54:22] God said I think I'll save a
[54:24] ninety-year-old film with the Holy Ghost
[54:26] and set him in the church who's a
[54:27] millionaire to pay that debt for the
[54:29] profit ha ha hey man I like that thought
[54:33] he pulled a fast one on him but God said
[54:35] no I'm gonna save a millionaire and send
[54:37] it right into by the Rams Church to pay
[54:38] this bill off but God let him suffer
[54:42] though he said I'm free I went to the
[54:46] room and started weeping and said you
[54:47] know I want to God to give me a revival
[54:49] in myself for about five years I've been
[54:52] choked out under a great burden that's
[54:55] been released now and I thought oh my
[54:59] I'm going to brother Jackson's have all
[55:01] the people pray for me that I'll have a
[55:02] revival down to myself I really need it
[55:05] I think we all feel a whole lot that way
[55:09] so I just want to encourage you brother
[55:10] Branham saw seasons in his life and this
[55:13] is scriptural we all go through scenes
[55:15] of our lives and this is we'd say a
[55:18] shorter season he said about five years
[55:20] when he finally got this case solved in
[55:23] the IRS so just be encouraged whatever
[55:26] you gone through there will be an end to
[55:28] it by God's grace God is gonna bring you
[55:30] out of that season because that's what
[55:32] it's all about it's all about season it
[55:34] all becomes beautiful in God's time now
[55:40] I want to encourage you too that God
[55:41] would give you scenes of glory so right
[55:43] after brother Ram preached the future
[55:45] home he said last Sunday I spoke at the
[55:47] future home and I think we're about
[55:49] 1,500 square miles around and it
[55:51] happened to be exactly the measure the
[55:52] city I was speaking about fifteen
[55:53] hundred square miles
[55:54] I've been feasting on that ever since so
[55:57] he goes through like a week or two of
[55:58] just feasting on the revelations see so
[56:01] God gives you mountaintop experiences
[56:03] praise God he'll speak something will be
[56:06] such a revelation and you'll go for two
[56:08] or three weeks all that one sermon see
[56:12] God will just plant something in your
[56:13] heart and he'll rejoice in that for a
[56:16] season praise God
[56:19] he said now why was he feasting on it
[56:22] because he knew that when this life is
[56:24] over
[56:24] I'm going to that City amen so it really
[56:30] made the future home a reality praise
[56:34] God
[56:35] so we feast see we feast on these
[56:37] messages that we hear because it's God's
[56:39] Word to us it's God's thus saith the
[56:41] Lord to us now I read that one recently
[56:45] - when he got the sword in his hand and
[56:48] he saw the seven angels it made him feel
[56:50] like he was first saved so some of those
[56:54] experiences will revive you you know in
[56:56] a new season of life and make you feel
[56:58] like you did when you first got saved
[57:00] praise God praise God oh my
[57:04] thank the Lord okay so that's now let's
[57:07] look at the night season I promise I
[57:09] won't preach as long as I didn't want to
[57:10] preach about an hour and 45 minutes this
[57:11] morning under that great anointing but
[57:15] let's look here let's look to the night
[57:16] season and maybe we'll start the 10th
[57:18] for a few minutes please so in the
[57:22] natural there's a time to get and then a
[57:25] time to lose in the natural now this
[57:28] could be financial gains and losses
[57:30] it can be material possessions just
[57:33] think about natural things you get
[57:35] things you lose I even thought just now
[57:40] I didn't write it down but I thought
[57:41] about with children - you know there's
[57:43] time to get children time to lose
[57:44] children family members you know you get
[57:48] family members you lose family members I
[57:49] should have wrote what I could write
[57:51] that down after the service so there's a
[57:54] time to get things but then there's a
[57:55] time to lose them as well so let's look
[57:58] at some scriptures about that but then
[58:00] the spiritual here's where it'll impact
[58:01] you and I at the most where we'll see
[58:03] this the most often is we get divine
[58:06] blessings like we just heard but then if
[58:09] we're not careful we can lose them -
[58:12] okay now let me say this - god works God
[58:17] works within the permissive will of God
[58:18] in other words God knows that we're
[58:20] gonna we're gonna fall short we're gonna
[58:22] stumble we're gonna make mistakes but
[58:24] God is patient with us in the midst of
[58:26] our mistakes so God knows we're gonna
[58:29] fall but then he's gonna bring the
[58:31] season around to raise us up again
[58:34] like in other words God wasn't surprised
[58:36] when brother Graham lied to the IRS God
[58:40] knew there be an end of that and he get
[58:41] revived at the end of that right to see
[58:45] God works within our faults to Humble us
[58:48] right and draw us closer to him that we
[58:51] might have another season of gain and
[58:54] see them the next time around where were
[58:56] tested will overcome that will overcome
[58:59] the temptation a lot will overcome the
[59:01] temptation to gossip right or overcome
[59:03] the temptation to fear or to be greedy
[59:05] or will overcome that the next time but
[59:08] then we'll have another season where we
[59:10] got to be tested again
[59:12] see because seasons exposed trials
[59:15] expose our weaknesses right like job
[59:19] said you know the things that I feared
[59:21] have come upon me so see God new job had
[59:25] that insecurity that fear so God had to
[59:27] allow all these things that happen but
[59:29] then the end of it job comes out he says
[59:31] I know when I come out I'll come forth
[59:32] as gold and so that's what that's what
[59:35] we're seeing is in these 14 or 28
[59:37] seasons that's what we're seeing God
[59:40] uses the cycle of all these seasons to
[59:43] mold us and to shape us in other words
[59:46] like the moon to help us reflect the
[59:48] full light of Christ amen because that's
[59:52] the purpose of a moon right is to
[59:54] reflect all the light of God of the Sun
[59:58] amen and like I heard it say on the
[1:00:01] sermon with that all's God wants to do
[1:00:03] is find some moon dust to reflect off of
[1:00:05] that's a God he was just a shy to
[1:00:08] reflect off this flesh praise God
[1:00:10] he just wants to find somebody he can
[1:00:12] reflect his light off of she so we're
[1:00:17] getting down to the the we're past the
[1:00:19] halfway point we're getting close to the
[1:00:20] end of this series here but then as I
[1:00:23] said I want to get to the part of on
[1:00:24] spiritual gifts so my whole purpose in
[1:00:27] this seasons and purpose series is so
[1:00:30] everybody can have a replication of
[1:00:33] you're getting your purpose in life and
[1:00:35] then you can invest in that because
[1:00:37] remember program said he said don't you
[1:00:39] know there'll be degrees in heaven so
[1:00:43] Christians who are more devoted to their
[1:00:44] purpose
[1:00:45] or more devoted will have more
[1:00:48] responsibility and more rewards in
[1:00:49] heaven and not that we're trying to get
[1:00:52] it but church if God give me something
[1:00:54] on this earth I want to use it all to
[1:00:56] his glory like if God gave you a job
[1:00:59] wouldn't you want to do a good job a
[1:01:01] half-hearted job or a job that was all
[1:01:04] you had amen
[1:01:07] see I see we're not doing it for rewards
[1:01:10] but we're doing it to glorify our king
[1:01:12] amen praise God
[1:01:16] that's why we do it so there's degrees
[1:01:19] in heaven just like there's degrees in
[1:01:20] Hell right remember Jesus said you're
[1:01:23] Pharisees he said your condemnation will
[1:01:25] be greater than theirs because you had
[1:01:28] the word you had the key of knowledge
[1:01:30] but you shut them out and you didn't
[1:01:31] enter in and you kept people from
[1:01:33] entering into the promises of God so
[1:01:35] your condemnation will be greater so see
[1:01:39] just like there's the Greece in hell
[1:01:41] there's degrees in heaven so we want to
[1:01:43] be faithful in the midst of our seasons
[1:01:45] now let's look here so here's a season
[1:01:51] where you get financial assets and I
[1:01:54] think I'll share one personally here
[1:01:56] tonight that I've never shared before
[1:01:57] but he that loveth silver shall not be
[1:02:00] satisfied with silver he that loveth
[1:02:02] abundance with increase this is also
[1:02:06] vanity so like rich people they'll never
[1:02:07] be they'll never feel like they have
[1:02:09] enough money we're all you know middle
[1:02:13] class poor but we still have to battle
[1:02:15] that right but see even the rich they'll
[1:02:17] never be happy with that now this is
[1:02:20] this is really good too when goods
[1:02:22] increase their increase that eat them
[1:02:25] and what good is there to the owners
[1:02:29] there of saving to be holding of them
[1:02:31] with their eyes so like let me just use
[1:02:35] my life as an example as my family has
[1:02:39] increased God has increased my wages on
[1:02:41] my job and then he's also increased my
[1:02:44] wife's business like it's and we my wife
[1:02:47] and I talk about all the time it was
[1:02:48] just God God did it yes so see when
[1:02:51] goods increase there and then now
[1:02:53] there's was that need to eat more food
[1:02:56] on the table right there there's more
[1:02:57] mouths to eat more food
[1:02:59] so God had to raise our income so we
[1:03:01] could buy more food to feed our little
[1:03:02] babies there but he's the one that sent
[1:03:04] him to us
[1:03:05] so he's faithful to take care of him and
[1:03:08] I don't think I've ever shared this
[1:03:09] before I'm just gonna share it now so
[1:03:11] back in 2015 when we moved in here the
[1:03:14] only reason we could afford this church
[1:03:15] is because we had all those families
[1:03:17] move in from Albion and we had a family
[1:03:20] a couple other place up north and God
[1:03:23] said all these families in here and it
[1:03:26] was right at the time when we needed it
[1:03:27] to and gotten so now we have you know we
[1:03:31] got rescued from that place that you
[1:03:32] know when we left there the ceiling was
[1:03:35] caving in because of water damage
[1:03:36] I don't even know if they have people
[1:03:37] there renting it out anymore but we were
[1:03:39] just about done with that place we're
[1:03:42] gonna have to get somewhere so God sent
[1:03:44] those families in there to provide us a
[1:03:46] new place of worship
[1:03:47] it's a much better place and then also
[1:03:51] don't provide I do use a little more of
[1:03:52] the ties to pay for my children's food
[1:03:54] you know you know and all the expenses
[1:03:56] and I and then and then a lot of them
[1:03:59] left and then God said it some more you
[1:04:02] know that's just and you know years and
[1:04:06] years later I can look back now and say
[1:04:09] what was God doing God was sending
[1:04:11] because we're having an increase of in
[1:04:13] our family and God help provide for
[1:04:16] everything there's a season to gain and
[1:04:19] a season to lose we have we're almost
[1:04:24] filling up that church that that
[1:04:25] sanctuary over there and now we you know
[1:04:27] we never fill up this place but that's
[1:04:28] okay but I just looked at it as that was
[1:04:31] a season that was just a time and season
[1:04:34] and God had orchestrated it at all
[1:04:37] so I thank the Lord for that
[1:04:40] there's a time to get and then a time to
[1:04:43] lose and I just want to encourage you
[1:04:47] search God will provide for you because
[1:04:49] you're better than birds you're better
[1:04:54] now that just make that blesses my heart
[1:04:57] jesus said take no thought for your life
[1:04:59] what you shall eat don't worry about
[1:05:01] your grocery bill what you'll drink your
[1:05:04] body what you don't worry about all the
[1:05:05] fancy clothes is not the life more than
[1:05:08] meat and the body than raiment he said
[1:05:12] behold the fowls of the air they don't
[1:05:14] so they sow not neither do they reap
[1:05:16] neither they gather barns yet your
[1:05:18] heavenly Father feeds them he said are
[1:05:20] you not much better than they aren't you
[1:05:24] better than the birds aren't you better
[1:05:27] than all these all these little animals
[1:05:29] out there you're better see why because
[1:05:31] you're in the image of God and if God
[1:05:35] takes care of those that are in the
[1:05:36] image of beasts and foul how much
[1:05:38] morally take care of those who are in
[1:05:39] his own image so I just want to
[1:05:42] encourage you there's a time and season
[1:05:44] you know there's a season to have a
[1:05:45] little less there's a scene that have a
[1:05:47] little more but God's in the midst of
[1:05:49] all of it
[1:05:50] which of you taken thought can add one
[1:05:52] cubit to his stature see we worry about
[1:05:55] things right we just worry worry but
[1:05:57] Jesus says don't worry there's a time
[1:05:59] and season for everything and well I
[1:06:01] take you thought for raiment consider
[1:06:03] the lilies of the field how they grow
[1:06:04] and they toil not there do they spin and
[1:06:06] yet I say unto you that even Solomon in
[1:06:08] all his glory was not arrayed like one
[1:06:11] of these wherefore if God so clothe the
[1:06:14] grass of the field which is today is and
[1:06:17] tomorrow's cast in the oven shall he not
[1:06:20] much more clothe you O ye of little
[1:06:22] faith
[1:06:23] and how many would say Amen tonight and
[1:06:25] say Lord increase my faith amen that's
[1:06:29] what I would say the Lord increase my
[1:06:30] faith because I'm better you said it I'm
[1:06:35] better than the birds now they still
[1:06:38] glorify God but God says we're better
[1:06:43] therefore take no Thought saying what
[1:06:45] shall we eat what shall we drink or what
[1:06:46] show where we shall we be clothed for
[1:06:48] all these things of the Gentiles seek
[1:06:50] for your father knoweth heavenly Father
[1:06:53] knoweth that you have need of all these
[1:06:55] things but seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:06:58] God and His righteousness and all these
[1:07:02] things shall be added unto you take
[1:07:04] therefore no thought for the morrow for
[1:07:06] the morrow shall take thought for the
[1:07:08] things of itself sufficient unto the day
[1:07:11] is the evil thereof now we see people
[1:07:14] many times you know that then I'll get
[1:07:16] in a financial bind
[1:07:17] and they'll they'll stop coming to
[1:07:19] church right or they'll stop putting God
[1:07:22] first but what does God say remember
[1:07:24] you're better than those birds
[1:07:26] they don't even plant yet I provide for
[1:07:29] them just put God first and I'll provide
[1:07:32] everything you need see and that's faith
[1:07:36] and then God will honor your faith God
[1:07:38] God will use these seasons to test your
[1:07:41] faith in order to build your sea but
[1:07:46] what did you want to see once to see
[1:07:47] somebody that will put him first and the
[1:07:50] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[1:07:52] I'll add all things unto you you're
[1:07:57] better
[1:07:58] amen and I'm not trying to make you feel
[1:08:00] prideful I just want to let you know
[1:08:02] you're better than the birds you're
[1:08:05] better in God's eyes Jesus says you're
[1:08:07] better amen
[1:08:10] now the Bible said there's a season to
[1:08:13] get loose so here wisdom is the
[1:08:15] principal thing now let's get to the
[1:08:16] spiritual therefore get wisdom with all
[1:08:21] thy getting get understanding
[1:08:23] so the getti means to acquire or possess
[1:08:28] so when the Word of God is being
[1:08:30] preached or when we hear the preaching
[1:08:31] we've got to rest that and say that that
[1:08:34] word that promise is mine I'm gonna keep
[1:08:36] that I'm gonna possess that I can't let
[1:08:40] it go over my head I can't forget about
[1:08:42] it like a forgetful here I gotta be a
[1:08:44] true here and I have to become that word
[1:08:48] I've got to possess that word I've got
[1:08:50] to believe that word that this is your
[1:08:53] season to get it amen
[1:08:55] there's a season to get it and you got
[1:08:58] to possess that like we see that song
[1:09:01] rise possess your inheritance amen this
[1:09:03] is the year of Jubilee now how do wisdom
[1:09:07] you get it by see the heart of the
[1:09:11] prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of
[1:09:13] the wise seeketh that knowledge so
[1:09:17] there's if you're in a season to get
[1:09:19] then that season is the season to seek
[1:09:21] God and it's the same word acquire and
[1:09:25] possess so brother Jesse I'm in a season
[1:09:28] getting I want to get more with God okay
[1:09:30] then you got to see God that means you
[1:09:33] have to you have to draw nigh to God and
[1:09:35] then God will draw nigh to you there's a
[1:09:38] season for that right and I love it too
[1:09:44] the Bible said this season is getting it
[1:09:47] is like buying it so the Bible said by
[1:09:49] the truth and don't sell don't lose it a
[1:09:52] man there's a season to get the season a
[1:09:54] little but the Bible said by the truth
[1:09:56] sell it not also wisdom and instruction
[1:10:00] understanding so there's a season for
[1:10:05] this we want to buy it
[1:10:06] purchase it make a sacrifice to get it
[1:10:09] and don't sell it out now here's what I
[1:10:14] was saying was it last week yeah it was
[1:10:16] last week but I already had this on my
[1:10:18] notes before brother Keith preached I
[1:10:20] already had this in my notes to preach
[1:10:21] so we need strength to be content in all
[1:10:24] seasons and this is what Paul showed us
[1:10:28] that's why that's why I cleese ask these
[1:10:30] three is so inspired because we could
[1:10:31] see Paul going through that season
[1:10:33] Paul's basically saying here I went
[1:10:36] through a season where I got and I went
[1:10:38] through a season where I lost but I
[1:10:40] still praise the Lord in all of it
[1:10:41] that's why that book is so inspired
[1:10:44] Solomon was so inspired to write about
[1:10:46] all those seasons because we can find
[1:10:48] all these seasons in the Word of God he
[1:10:51] said I rejoice in the Lord greatly and
[1:10:52] now at the last of your care of me have
[1:10:55] flirts again wit and you were also
[1:10:57] careful but you lacked opportunity not
[1:11:00] that I read in respect to want for I
[1:11:02] have learned in whatsoever state I am
[1:11:04] therewith to be content now I'm not
[1:11:08] going to read this but did you know when
[1:11:10] Paul was writing this the only church
[1:11:13] that met his needs was the Philippians
[1:11:16] no just heard about Paul being in prison
[1:11:19] poem president nobody reached out to the
[1:11:22] Prophet prison except those Philippians
[1:11:24] I don't know brother bang but I believe
[1:11:26] there's a great reward for them don't
[1:11:28] you know all the churches you know
[1:11:31] remember at the end of his ministry he
[1:11:34] said all the ages rejected me a lot of
[1:11:36] churches were rejected him but the
[1:11:37] Philippians for some reason God records
[1:11:39] them Paul said you're the only ones who
[1:11:41] met my need and the actually the Bible
[1:11:45] does say why Paul says because so you'll
[1:11:49] have rewards in heaven that there'll be
[1:11:50] rewards
[1:11:51] added to your account in heaven so see
[1:11:54] brother brother Mike that means God will
[1:11:56] let you and I go through times where we
[1:11:58] don't have much and the whole purpose of
[1:12:01] it is so that God will anoint somebody
[1:12:03] else to meet your needs
[1:12:04] God can reward them later on amen what
[1:12:09] do we feel like oh I feel God I don't
[1:12:11] have much money this season my life I'm
[1:12:12] so discouraged but the whole time you
[1:12:14] don't even know
[1:12:15] that's God's season to anoint somebody
[1:12:17] else to help you out and then reward
[1:12:19] them in heaven we think did I sin
[1:12:23] against you god was it me now if your
[1:12:25] sin and stop sinning but if you're not
[1:12:27] sitting and it's just a season that God
[1:12:29] is allowed then praise the Lord then God
[1:12:32] has used this season to bless somebody
[1:12:34] else and I'm gonna read that so I'm
[1:12:38] gonna keep reading this but I'm gonna go
[1:12:39] in Philippians in my Bible so he so he
[1:12:41] learned in any season to be content I
[1:12:45] know both how to be abased humbled and I
[1:12:48] know how to abound they know how to be
[1:12:51] really humble but also increase really
[1:12:53] well spiritually I know how to have
[1:12:55] these mountaintop seasons everywhere and
[1:12:59] at all things I'm instructed both to be
[1:13:01] full and to be hungry both to abound and
[1:13:05] to suffer need I can do all things
[1:13:09] through Christ which strengtheneth me
[1:13:11] praise God now like I said last week
[1:13:14] Church you and I rarely have to deal
[1:13:16] with this so we have to make an attempt
[1:13:18] to fast right we have to die fast on
[1:13:23] Wednesday I don't know if I don't know
[1:13:25] which day you fasted but I fasted
[1:13:26] Wednesday before preaching but see we
[1:13:29] don't really know to see you brother
[1:13:30] Mike we got all these blessings well we
[1:13:34] don't struggle with starvation but we've
[1:13:35] got it still we have to we have to deny
[1:13:38] ourselves in order to be more spiritual
[1:13:41] because if not you've all seen people
[1:13:43] that let themselves go spiritually and
[1:13:45] usually when they let themselves go
[1:13:46] spiritually they let themselves go as
[1:13:49] well naturally as well which means they
[1:13:52] eat too much
[1:13:52] they sleep too much they get lazy they
[1:13:54] don't work they don't work as hard as
[1:13:56] they should
[1:13:56] you've all seen it right I see it quite
[1:13:59] often like for example I know people
[1:14:01] that from other churches that I've
[1:14:03] talked to over the years like that
[1:14:04] he's good brother but he got addicted to
[1:14:08] diet coke and he gained a lot of weight
[1:14:10] and he couldn't he couldn't even walk up
[1:14:13] stairs at work and the one day the Holy
[1:14:16] Spirit told him stop drinking diet coke
[1:14:17] he stopped drinking diet coke and now I
[1:14:19] can walk up the steps again
[1:14:20] and he lost all that way and he he
[1:14:23] testified in front of everybody about it
[1:14:26] so you see like so we have a
[1:14:28] responsibility to take care of these
[1:14:30] temples amen and so now so he's got a
[1:14:35] he's not gonna be hungry but you know
[1:14:37] you know his flesh is gonna want that
[1:14:38] diet coke but he's got to crucify that
[1:14:41] desire so he know what's the key word
[1:14:46] he's got to learn he's got to learn it
[1:14:50] the look to deny yourself in laodicea
[1:14:53] right
[1:14:55] you have to learn to do that yeah I
[1:15:00] talked to numerous brothers that'll have
[1:15:02] back pain or they'll have headaches and
[1:15:04] it's all because they're overeating
[1:15:08] they're not exercise they're not taking
[1:15:10] care of themselves Church we have to do
[1:15:12] that right we have to do that because if
[1:15:18] not if we're if we're putting too much
[1:15:21] in then our body's gonna suffer body's
[1:15:25] gonna suffer but Paul because he was in
[1:15:27] prison yes he went through times of
[1:15:30] hunger but see we're not we're not
[1:15:32] suffering with that right now we have to
[1:15:33] make sure we are temperate the Bible
[1:15:35] said we're temperate in some things all
[1:15:38] things seen with coffee I have to be can
[1:15:41] have to be temperate with coffee right
[1:15:44] you have to be tempered with sugar and
[1:15:47] to be tempered with fast food you'll be
[1:15:49] tempered with chocolate yeah you have to
[1:15:51] be temper with all things
[1:15:52] don't let anything mask you just be
[1:15:55] mastered by Christ amen
[1:15:58] because the Bible said you can't be
[1:16:00] addicted to one thing and that's serving
[1:16:01] the Saints there's one time the Bible
[1:16:03] says the word addiction and that's
[1:16:05] addicted to serving the Saints that's
[1:16:07] ought to be addicted to you amen
[1:16:09] I get a spirit rush a spirit of high
[1:16:11] every time I serve the Saints
[1:16:14] hey glory that's what we need to be
[1:16:17] addicted to praise God but let me read
[1:16:20] that before I forget just so you can see
[1:16:26] and church yeah let me be out I'll just
[1:16:28] let me tell this to I'm just gonna tell
[1:16:30] it while I'm here I was going through a
[1:16:31] real bad financial season when I was
[1:16:33] doing my master's degree plus 30 a few
[1:16:36] years ago and I'm just gonna tell it
[1:16:38] because I'm I feel like I'll just tell
[1:16:40] it tonight
[1:16:41] I was really low on money you know I
[1:16:43] yeah we went through three years where
[1:16:45] we never got a pay raise at school so
[1:16:47] our contract froze it was right after a
[1:16:49] 2008 that market crash in 2008 and I
[1:16:54] hope I was really going I couldn't pay
[1:16:57] for this this cut this class I was taken
[1:16:59] and Paula Fontaine sent me a check in
[1:17:02] the mail for $1,000 yeah and it paid for
[1:17:05] that college course that's why when I
[1:17:08] was over there I told the Saints I said
[1:17:09] I said I told his church I said you know
[1:17:11] most of you I don't I don't know mostly
[1:17:13] I said bye I know one thing I said your
[1:17:15] pastors been a real friend to me yeah I
[1:17:18] said I'm not gonna say it but I started
[1:17:20] crying you know I was telling that but I
[1:17:21] said there was times when I really
[1:17:22] needed it in god anointed him to help me
[1:17:25] now I had to get in a really low spot
[1:17:28] but if you look at yeah it's actually
[1:17:31] verse 15 and 16 now he Philippians know
[1:17:34] also that in the beginning of the gospel
[1:17:36] when I departed from Macedonia no church
[1:17:38] communicated with me as concerning
[1:17:41] giving and receiving but ye only so God
[1:17:44] almost that all the other churches get
[1:17:45] kind of busy doing other things except
[1:17:48] the Philippians there's in verse 16 for
[1:17:51] even in Thessalonica ye said once and
[1:17:55] again unto my necessity so twice twice
[1:17:59] the Philippians heard about the prophet
[1:18:00] needed food or clothing and sent it and
[1:18:03] then in verse 17 not because I desire
[1:18:05] gift he said see who who here likes to
[1:18:10] come and ask for help does anyone like
[1:18:11] to ask for help no it actually
[1:18:13] embarrasses me doesn't it dude
[1:18:16] it embarrasses me when I have to ask
[1:18:17] somebody for help right especially
[1:18:20] financial help that's the most
[1:18:22] embarrassing to me
[1:18:24] and so Paul says you know I wasn't as
[1:18:27] you know I didn't ask you guys for help
[1:18:29] because I desire to get gifts he said I
[1:18:36] desire fruit that may abound to your
[1:18:39] account and so I look and look back at
[1:18:45] my life now and I had a thousand dollars
[1:18:47] to pay off on my class I didn't have I
[1:18:49] didn't have the money so God God let me
[1:18:51] get in a time to lose
[1:18:54] God let let me get in a short time said
[1:18:57] he can anoint brother Paul to send me
[1:18:59] that money to meet my need now I believe
[1:19:05] it I believe it has great rewards in
[1:19:06] heaven that brother now like that but
[1:19:08] he's a he another pastor are paying to
[1:19:11] put the message in Spanish I think
[1:19:14] they're gonna finish up this year next
[1:19:15] year all the sermons in Spanish are now
[1:19:18] translating the message that's really
[1:19:21] unselfish that's really unselfish that's
[1:19:24] a really godly thing to do so I want to
[1:19:28] just show that they're their strength
[1:19:29] for all seasons and then God may let you
[1:19:33] go through a season of loss anoint
[1:19:36] somebody else to help you out that
[1:19:39] they'll have treasure in heaven now
[1:19:46] church when Paul got saved he lost
[1:19:48] everything so there was a season he lost
[1:19:51] everything but he gained Christ
[1:19:54] yeah doubtless I count all things but
[1:19:56] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[1:19:59] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've
[1:20:01] suffered so it wasn't easy to suffer the
[1:20:04] loss of all things so Paul lost his
[1:20:07] financial help right no doubt Paul was
[1:20:09] you know he was of the stock of Benjamin
[1:20:11] the Pharisee of Pharisees no doubt he is
[1:20:13] his retirement has already paid for
[1:20:15] right
[1:20:17] he had everything lined up he didn't
[1:20:19] have a wife or children he had all this
[1:20:21] and here they had basically just as a
[1:20:22] priest he had all this lined up but he
[1:20:26] left it all he suffered the loss of
[1:20:29] everything why that I might win in
[1:20:31] Christ amen there's a season for that
[1:20:38] and I do count them but dung that I may
[1:20:40] win Christ Jesus there's a season to
[1:20:44] lose but there's also a season to gain
[1:20:46] to gain Christ praise God it was a
[1:20:51] suffering it wasn't easy
[1:20:53] church it wasn't easy when my best
[1:20:55] friend emailed me when I heard the
[1:20:57] message and said the devil's shown you
[1:20:58] those things it wasn't easy to lose my
[1:21:00] best friend because I told him I said
[1:21:02] you've been the best friend I've ever
[1:21:05] had and then he said the devil showed me
[1:21:07] these things
[1:21:08] it wasn't easy not easy to have your mom
[1:21:11] rebuke you you know like my mom rebuked
[1:21:13] me and all these preachers and everybody
[1:21:16] rebuking you and no longer they know not
[1:21:18] to call you they no longer texting no
[1:21:20] longer ask how you're doing they don't
[1:21:21] that that they separate them set it's
[1:21:23] never easy it's suffering but you win
[1:21:26] Christ amen
[1:21:31] glory now with a statue for four men
[1:21:35] their seasons to get right because the
[1:21:37] Bible said giving all diligence ad
[1:21:40] in the seasons where you get remember
[1:21:42] you've got to show diligence you've got
[1:21:44] to see God during these these seasons so
[1:21:47] Paul Peter said use all your diligence
[1:21:49] which is your earnest effort all your
[1:21:52] effort that you can muster up if this is
[1:21:54] a season for you to get up spiritual
[1:21:55] blessing then you've got to put all your
[1:21:57] effort into it for things be in you and
[1:22:01] abound or increase they make you that
[1:22:04] you should be neither barren nor
[1:22:05] unfruitful so if you're in a season of
[1:22:07] getting spiritual blessings then you're
[1:22:09] putting all your effort into it and then
[1:22:11] things are gonna just be growing in your
[1:22:13] life like let me just share a testimony
[1:22:16] real quick okay not for me but for
[1:22:18] brother Aaron last week you saw he came
[1:22:22] right and as his family members were
[1:22:24] here when I was outside I was Charlie
[1:22:26] trying to talk to his family member
[1:22:27] about some some things about a home
[1:22:30] church and yeah and I said I said I said
[1:22:34] brother I said your brother has grown
[1:22:36] tremendously since he started coming to
[1:22:38] home coming here to make this his home
[1:22:40] Church and his family member without it
[1:22:43] just interrupted me and said yes I've
[1:22:45] seen a major change in my brother in the
[1:22:47] last year
[1:22:50] Church you start adding the word and you
[1:22:53] start obeying all the word about having
[1:22:54] a home church and paying ties and obeah
[1:22:56] faith with the Word of God God is going
[1:22:58] to add these things in you and you're
[1:23:01] gonna abound and then the people in your
[1:23:03] family the people in our families our
[1:23:05] church members are gonna see the growth
[1:23:07] of Christ in our lives
[1:23:09] amen and so I shared that with brother
[1:23:12] Aaron as an encouragement and that's
[1:23:14] when you know you really be ought to be
[1:23:15] encouraged when your family members see
[1:23:17] you're growing amen because they see
[1:23:20] your spots but they also see your best
[1:23:22] buds amen that's what that testimony
[1:23:26] that Barrett brother Aaron's family and
[1:23:29] I'm talking to his dad a few were last
[1:23:31] month was earlier this month about three
[1:23:36] weeks ago and we were talking about how
[1:23:39] he puts all those stickers on his car
[1:23:41] you know and he wears all those Jesus
[1:23:44] shirts and I said I really appreciate
[1:23:46] how Aaron does that and his dad kind of
[1:23:48] leaned back and he was real serious he
[1:23:49] said yeah every Christian should be like
[1:23:51] that now not that you have to wear
[1:23:53] shirts but I was just talking about
[1:23:55] about witnessing and being bold about
[1:23:57] Christ and so I told Aaron about that
[1:24:01] too I said your dad knows you're living
[1:24:03] the right kind of life see when God is
[1:24:05] adding to you it abounds in you and
[1:24:08] people will see the growth in your life
[1:24:13] again now this is the same thing with
[1:24:15] Paul but he that findeth his life shall
[1:24:18] lose it so see I see I took the
[1:24:21] concordance and look up blues there's a
[1:24:22] season to get and loss getting loose
[1:24:25] so see you find these as use the
[1:24:26] concordance that way so when you find
[1:24:29] that you get it but then when you get it
[1:24:32] you lose it and he that lose his life
[1:24:35] for my sake shall find it amen now this
[1:24:38] is the I think even this applies even
[1:24:40] after you get saved I for example once
[1:24:42] you realize what gift you have you can
[1:24:44] forsake all your other time and invest
[1:24:45] in your gift your gift things in your
[1:24:48] life praise God now we're getting down
[1:24:56] to
[1:24:57] and here I believe yeah it's about good
[1:24:59] it's about an hour and races are okay
[1:25:03] now here let's look at the lost part now
[1:25:05] this is the lost part and I got at one
[1:25:08] scripture if you got your Bible turned
[1:25:09] not to this but turn to 1st
[1:25:11] Thessalonians 4 I'm that's the scripture
[1:25:13] not I don't want to forget 1st
[1:25:19] Thessalonians 4 verse 1 but I want to
[1:25:24] look at this thought about gaining and
[1:25:25] losing spiritually a little bit deeper
[1:25:27] here because this is how you lose now
[1:25:31] David lost a right spirit so before this
[1:25:36] David spirit was right I'm gonna choose
[1:25:38] the word I'm gonna follow the word under
[1:25:40] God's Word but he lost the right spirit
[1:25:42] he got a wrong spirit and the joy he
[1:25:47] lost the right spirit and joy through
[1:25:48] lust murder and adultery now if you
[1:25:50] remember this I preached us why go but
[1:25:52] it came back to me fresh he was supposed
[1:25:55] to be out battling with the kings in
[1:25:57] church you and I supposed to be battling
[1:26:00] in prayer amen because the Bible said
[1:26:03] when you got on the full armor of God
[1:26:04] you're praying with all prayer and all
[1:26:07] supplication ain't it to see when we're
[1:26:11] in a season of prayer when we're in the
[1:26:13] Battle of prayer we won't go looking for
[1:26:16] other things to fulfill up because we're
[1:26:18] busy fighting amen
[1:26:21] that's not what every season I want to
[1:26:23] be laid at the altar in every season of
[1:26:25] my life I want to be right there at the
[1:26:26] battle praise God but see he LUT he
[1:26:31] didn't recognize this or he didn't
[1:26:34] recognize the season is that what the
[1:26:35] Bible actually says let me look that up
[1:26:37] real quick I think that's uh ii samuel
[1:26:39] 11 if that says season boy i'll tell you
[1:26:43] i'm not sure like that welllike says
[1:26:51] yeah at that time when the keys go to
[1:26:53] battle so then say season were says at
[1:26:54] that time it was a time for battle but
[1:26:58] he chose other words he chose not to
[1:27:00] pray I'm making it for our day this is
[1:27:04] the topic we pray pastors asking us to
[1:27:06] pray pastors asking us the fast or the
[1:27:09] Holy Spirit's ask me to pray
[1:27:11] well then you should pray that's the
[1:27:13] time to pray but David page still at
[1:27:16] Jerusalem
[1:27:17] so David Terry's right he waits out he
[1:27:22] sits out says I'm not gonna obey yet and
[1:27:25] when that unless first he saw her
[1:27:27] bathing bring it over to me committed
[1:27:30] adultery and then murder flowed out of
[1:27:34] that and then when he when the Prophet
[1:27:37] corrects him he says created me a clean
[1:27:38] heart and renew a right spirit within me
[1:27:41] so he lost the right spirit he needed it
[1:27:45] renewed cast me not away from your
[1:27:47] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[1:27:49] from me restore to me the joy of thy
[1:27:52] salvation so he lost it there's a time
[1:27:55] to get there's a time to lose now why do
[1:27:58] you lose it because he was in the battle
[1:28:00] he wasn't in the battle and we got to
[1:28:03] keep battling for souls praise God
[1:28:07] really Church you know the rapture could
[1:28:09] be so close that the last ones were
[1:28:10] praying for is these children to get the
[1:28:12] Holy Ghost
[1:28:13] so James are really praying for you get
[1:28:14] the Holy Ghost when you're like five
[1:28:16] years old if he's the last one but in
[1:28:20] all reality you know he may be live to
[1:28:22] be a hundred but that's where we're look
[1:28:25] that's why we look at some of these
[1:28:26] things right we don't know the timer
[1:28:29] season so we got to always be in the
[1:28:32] battle always got to be battling in
[1:28:35] prayer god save what you can God search
[1:28:38] my heart cleanse my heart keep me pure
[1:28:40] stay in the battle prayer a fully
[1:28:43] armored Christian will be praying always
[1:28:45] and all prayer amen
[1:28:48] and for me this is my prayer meeting
[1:28:50] church every Sunday morning every
[1:28:51] Wednesday night half hour before church
[1:28:53] that's my prayer meeting I'll try to to
[1:28:56] keep myself in the Battle of Prayer to
[1:28:58] keep myself there battling coming
[1:29:00] against the you know of course every
[1:29:01] morning in the prayer closet to like
[1:29:02] this morning you know but just stay in
[1:29:04] the Battle of Prayer and if you do that
[1:29:06] God will reward you openly so he lost it
[1:29:10] he lost the right spirit and he lost joy
[1:29:14] he lost it a see loose or
[1:29:19] else can one not here's how we lose now
[1:29:21] this is the extreme this is the extreme
[1:29:24] like demon-possession where you need a
[1:29:26] demon cast out but that's most of them
[1:29:29] for most of us that that that won't
[1:29:30] happen to us because we want to let that
[1:29:34] many demons come in okay when to enter
[1:29:37] in a strong Mans house and spoil rob is
[1:29:39] goods because the thief comes to steal
[1:29:40] kill and destroy except his first bind
[1:29:44] the strongman
[1:29:44] so Satan will paralyze your strength and
[1:29:47] then he'll spoil the house he'll you'll
[1:29:49] lose from your your human spirit you
[1:29:52] can't touch your soul because the Holy
[1:29:53] Ghost is there but see this is how we
[1:29:56] lose we let the devil get in and he
[1:29:59] takes some of our joy he takes some of
[1:30:02] our peace it makes us nervous now for
[1:30:06] most of us this is how Satan gets in not
[1:30:08] demon possession but just like a wrong
[1:30:11] anointing right just as we get the wrong
[1:30:14] anointing in our human spirit we don't
[1:30:16] get possessed there where they live
[1:30:17] there and they won't move without you
[1:30:19] know casting them out he said be angry
[1:30:21] and sin not let not the Sun go down upon
[1:30:23] your wrath neither give place to the
[1:30:25] devil so you go to bed angry by a man or
[1:30:28] I go to go to bed angry you gave place
[1:30:33] to the devil you're gonna wake up pretty
[1:30:34] bad wake up in a bad place you just lost
[1:30:37] your victory Paul says don't give a
[1:30:40] place to Satan that's in your mind go to
[1:30:44] bed angry of course to the people it can
[1:30:46] be the same for any sin you go to bed
[1:30:47] lustful right
[1:30:48] go to bed greedy you go to bed tired you
[1:30:50] not sorry hope you're tired you go to
[1:30:53] bed lust thing you know something like
[1:30:54] that you give a place that's how we lose
[1:30:57] we don't cast down those imaginations
[1:31:00] right and the Bible said you can even
[1:31:05] lose your first love nevertheless I have
[1:31:08] somewhat against thee because thou hast
[1:31:09] left your first love you left it behind
[1:31:12] you you lost it right you you you're not
[1:31:16] with it right you you should be with
[1:31:17] your first love right in this place of
[1:31:19] spiritual revelation like we said it's
[1:31:21] important you're in a place of spiritual
[1:31:23] rubber you dig deep enough till you're
[1:31:24] in the spirit of Revelation but you let
[1:31:26] we leave that right we leave that in
[1:31:28] times and seasons of our lives
[1:31:31] so the only way to get back is remember
[1:31:33] where you were falling from repent and
[1:31:35] do the first works or else our company
[1:31:38] quickly and remove thy candlestick out
[1:31:39] of this place except thou repent praise
[1:31:44] God you have to remember your first
[1:31:46] works what did I do in that fresh season
[1:31:48] of victory what
[1:31:48] I knew in that season where I bound and
[1:31:50] I was yet to go do those first works go
[1:31:54] do those first works now we went through
[1:32:00] this and then we but the brother
[1:32:01] preached on the last week about program
[1:32:03] he lost the feeling of the people that's
[1:32:06] because he got angry if they won't hear
[1:32:07] my message then I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
[1:32:09] not gonna preach to them anymore so
[1:32:11] brother Rams are looking at the results
[1:32:14] and he saw more people cutting their
[1:32:15] hair more men you know marrying 3-4
[1:32:17] times he said if they're not gonna
[1:32:18] listen to me fine I'm not gonna preach
[1:32:20] anymore he lost the feeling he had for
[1:32:23] the people see he got his eyes on the
[1:32:26] ones that were rejecting it instead of
[1:32:27] his eyes and the ones that were
[1:32:28] receiving it god help us to keep our
[1:32:30] eyes on the ones who are receiving it
[1:32:32] amen
[1:32:32] other than yeah we can't be discouraged
[1:32:35] by those people follow away it's their
[1:32:37] choice right we've got to choose to stay
[1:32:39] faithful we've got to choose to abound
[1:32:41] in the things of God now like this here
[1:32:46] I like this program said Satan the first
[1:32:51] thing he bites off is your brotherly
[1:32:52] love so remember this hatch riverman
[1:32:54] charities the Holy Ghost but what he'll
[1:32:57] start doing to get you to lose is to
[1:32:59] bite your brotherly love first so it's
[1:33:02] like it's like he God builds you up you
[1:33:04] get capped but then he'll start you know
[1:33:06] you'll never lose your cat but Satan
[1:33:07] starts biting your brotherly kindness
[1:33:08] away he started to remember brother
[1:33:11] Hammond could you can lose some of that
[1:33:13] right but BAM lost his self-control lied
[1:33:15] to the IRS you know he he lost that
[1:33:17] self-control that temperance
[1:33:18] he said let's get a big picture of God's
[1:33:21] treats bearing nine spiritual gifts
[1:33:22] they're healing the sick they're
[1:33:23] speaking in tongues they're casting out
[1:33:25] Devils they're doing great works and
[1:33:26] preaching the unadulterated Word of God
[1:33:28] no denomination to tie them down they're
[1:33:30] free doing a great work so income this
[1:33:32] little devil sitting up in his two horns
[1:33:34] sitting out in front like a grasshopper
[1:33:36] you know and is it an old greedy teeth
[1:33:38] that's his first Apollo room he come in
[1:33:40] to eat off brotherly love he said you
[1:33:44] know did you know so-and-so did such
[1:33:46] so-and-so's Church I wouldn't believe
[1:33:48] that bunch of people see there he is the
[1:33:50] first thing so see we got to make sure
[1:33:53] we talk good about everybody if somebody
[1:33:55] sins hide it from everybody right hide
[1:34:00] it
[1:34:02] actually want to eat the fruit of faith
[1:34:03] faith in the word now look how do you
[1:34:07] know that's the word it's been
[1:34:09] translated so many times well now we
[1:34:10] know from this morning we got the right
[1:34:15] scrolls amen
[1:34:16] men have died for these scrolls amen
[1:34:19] that little devil sitting eating right
[1:34:22] that has words been translated so many
[1:34:23] times he's this or he's at the other oh
[1:34:26] he's all this see now that's another
[1:34:28] fruity eat off the joy of salvation Shh
[1:34:34] you people make too much noise
[1:34:36] oh my mother says you're jazz many times
[1:34:43] seen in how loud you are not always but
[1:34:48] sometimes they see cuz there's other
[1:34:51] quotes brother Ram sent a wheelbarrow
[1:34:53] squeaks when it's empty but when you
[1:34:56] load it up with good things you don't
[1:34:57] hear the squeaks anymore so you got to
[1:35:01] bounce it out you know but man said the
[1:35:04] greatest things like the world's all the
[1:35:06] rotations they do you know thousand
[1:35:08] miles per hour they're rotating they
[1:35:09] don't make any noise while they're doing
[1:35:10] it
[1:35:11] brother Han says sometimes great things
[1:35:14] don't make any noise so we find out he
[1:35:18] took away the joy you know David one
[1:35:20] time lost the joy of his salvation he
[1:35:21] didn't lose his salvation he just lost
[1:35:23] the joy of it he just cried Lord restore
[1:35:27] to me the joy of my salvation see the
[1:35:29] joy this little ole Palmer begin to eat
[1:35:32] that fruit of joy out now lookie here
[1:35:34] you people make too much noise I tell
[1:35:35] you all this crying to say an amen the
[1:35:37] shouting that's nonsense there's nothing
[1:35:39] to that see first thing you know he's
[1:35:40] sent in a big more you know set there
[1:35:43] all them dead large hungry dead churches
[1:35:49] that we walked into lately right you
[1:35:51] visit other places you go different
[1:35:52] places well we don't want this place to
[1:35:54] be dead amen we got to keep our joy the
[1:35:57] joy of our salvation
[1:36:00] hallelujah don't be afraid about making
[1:36:03] noise amen
[1:36:04] and church there's been times where I've
[1:36:07] been so discouraged and I didn't realize
[1:36:09] so after shouting or screaming or crying
[1:36:10] that's when I got the victory back
[1:36:12] it's like Satan was trying to keep me so
[1:36:15] quiet
[1:36:16] and keep my joy from coming out but once
[1:36:17] I got the joy I felt so much better amen
[1:36:21] he's trying to quiet those pricks
[1:36:23] because God lives in the praises of his
[1:36:26] people amen
[1:36:27] the Lord inhabits the praises of his
[1:36:29] people Israel amen
[1:36:31] he God lives in the praise that's right
[1:36:38] some of these embalming fluids have
[1:36:40] so-called doctored and Creed's pumped up
[1:36:43] in their veins where the Spirit of God
[1:36:45] out to be running where the old church
[1:36:46] Creed pumped in there no wonder that icy
[1:36:49] cold and dead spiritual thermometer 90
[1:36:51] below zero and church this is a Easter
[1:36:54] message - this is the Easter message cuz
[1:36:57] I listen to this a few weeks ago I was
[1:36:58] mowing the grass
[1:36:59] I thought he preached a restoration of
[1:37:01] bright tree and was just saying dry
[1:37:03] bones amen
[1:37:04] well praise the Lord there's two
[1:37:06] confirmation they met I supposed to
[1:37:08] preach us tonight glory
[1:37:11] yeah somebody say Amen everybody
[1:37:13] stretched their neck around like some
[1:37:15] kind of goose or something want to know
[1:37:16] what they said it's a shame when the
[1:37:18] Spirit of God ought to be joy peace and
[1:37:21] love but this little bug start to eat on
[1:37:23] it he eat all the joy away oh thank you
[1:37:28] Jesus give us joy the Holy Ghost amen
[1:37:33] now this is the next thought he uses and
[1:37:36] this is why I told you to turn the first
[1:37:39] stone so let's close with this here's
[1:37:41] how you get it back let me say like this
[1:37:43] search God wants our seasons of losing
[1:37:47] our joy and losing our he wants those to
[1:37:49] be as short as possible because let me
[1:37:52] tell you Church it's the will of God for
[1:37:54] you to be sanctified right clean that
[1:37:58] it's God's will that you're clean all
[1:38:00] the time look at 1st Thessalonians 4 1
[1:38:04] so God and that's how brother grams IRS
[1:38:07] thing that didn't last very long and the
[1:38:09] only less like a couple maybe a day or
[1:38:10] maybe less than that because he went to
[1:38:12] pray for somebody in the Holy Spirit
[1:38:13] don't put your filthy or don't put your
[1:38:15] line hands on that so he went to pray
[1:38:16] God forgive and then come back and
[1:38:18] prayed God wants our seasons of this
[1:38:21] obviously very short but course it's up
[1:38:25] to us how long we remain in those things
[1:38:26] sometimes sometimes
[1:38:29] first Thessalonians 4 verse 1 now this
[1:38:31] is the rapture chapter so he starts the
[1:38:36] rapture chapter off by saying walk in
[1:38:38] sanctification a state they divide Amen
[1:38:43] see you keep your whole body clean so
[1:38:45] that God's filling you all the time
[1:38:46] you're full your soul filled with oil
[1:38:48] all the time that you go up in the
[1:38:50] rapture amen
[1:38:51] because you're filled with the Holy
[1:38:53] Ghost all the time walk in the spirit
[1:38:55] verse 1 furthermore then we beseech you
[1:38:59] brethren and exhort you by the Lord
[1:39:00] Jesus that as you have received of us
[1:39:02] how you ought to walk him to please God
[1:39:04] so you would abound more and more so now
[1:39:08] means to be fruitful so be more fruitful
[1:39:10] in how you're walking with the Lord be
[1:39:13] more and more fruitful more and more
[1:39:14] abounding verse 2 for ye know what
[1:39:18] Commandments we gave you by the Lord
[1:39:20] Jesus so now it's a command brother Mike
[1:39:22] I think it's a suggestion
[1:39:25] it's commanded and Jesus church he won't
[1:39:28] give you a you and I command if we can't
[1:39:30] keep it right God's not gonna give us a
[1:39:33] requirement if he won't make a way for
[1:39:35] us to achieve it right so verse 3 for
[1:39:39] this is the will of God even your
[1:39:43] sanctification that ye should abstain
[1:39:45] from fornication see so the
[1:39:49] sanctification is the will of God for
[1:39:51] all times and seasons then every one of
[1:39:55] you should know how to possess his
[1:39:56] vessel and Saint vacation and honor not
[1:39:58] in the lust of concussions even as the
[1:40:01] Gentiles which know not God that no man
[1:40:04] go beyond and defraud his brother in any
[1:40:06] matter so see this is more than just
[1:40:07] sexual purity this is in everything be
[1:40:10] Saints keep a sanctified vessel at all
[1:40:13] times so you don't sin against anyone
[1:40:15] well you got brotherly kindness amen
[1:40:17] the bug don't eat away your brotherly
[1:40:19] kindness so you're good at all times so
[1:40:22] our men and women yes because that the
[1:40:26] Lord is the Avenger of such see tonight
[1:40:29] as we also have forewarned you and
[1:40:32] testified forgotten that called us to
[1:40:34] uncleanness but unto holiness now with
[1:40:37] that in mind that that's why I said that
[1:40:39] in every season god it's
[1:40:42] will for you to come out of any sin in
[1:40:45] every season because it's God's will
[1:40:47] that you don't have any of his vengeance
[1:40:50] upon your life and here's where brother
[1:40:53] man says it in the restoration of the
[1:40:54] bride tree so right after he says you
[1:40:56] can lose your joy he tells you you got
[1:40:57] the right to go get it back around said
[1:41:03] enforce she said we have the privilege
[1:41:06] to enforce upon sin the claims that God
[1:41:10] give us for God has in law and his word
[1:41:13] is the law and God in this word made
[1:41:15] certain claims to the church therefore
[1:41:18] we have a right to force these claims
[1:41:20] upon Satan and say give it back and
[1:41:23] Satan has to do it because we can take
[1:41:26] God's age in the Holy Spirit go right
[1:41:29] down on our knees and say it's thus
[1:41:31] sayeth the Lord
[1:41:32] amen so see listen if you're defrauding
[1:41:36] someone or you hurt somebody you don't
[1:41:38] have to remain in that the Bible said
[1:41:40] it's not God's will for you to hurt
[1:41:42] anybody in any manner or have any sexual
[1:41:44] sin in any manner at any time you can
[1:41:47] say Satan I'm coming out of this lust
[1:41:49] I'm coming out of this bad habit and you
[1:41:52] I enforce by the Holy Spirit that you
[1:41:54] give back my sanctification you get back
[1:41:56] my holiness amen get back my joy bring
[1:41:59] back my peace I'm enforcing it because
[1:42:02] it's God's will and I do it amen praise
[1:42:05] God now you can't always do that with
[1:42:07] healing right you can't always do that
[1:42:09] with salvation but you can do that with
[1:42:11] sanctification but it's God's will for
[1:42:14] you to enforce it that you'd afford not
[1:42:16] anybody that you live a sanctified life
[1:42:18] it's the will of God amen this is the
[1:42:23] will of God as Jesus said man shall live
[1:42:27] by what every word it's God's will it's
[1:42:31] God's will now for us to do miracles all
[1:42:33] the time although we do that at times
[1:42:35] but it's God's will that we keep all the
[1:42:38] Word of God at all times
[1:42:39] that's this perfect will we can choose
[1:42:41] the permissive or the perfect and this
[1:42:44] is what Brennan tells us we have a right
[1:42:45] to enforce it we can take but like
[1:42:47] Graham says the police you can take the
[1:42:49] police officer if somebody's in your
[1:42:51] house because they don't you got you got
[1:42:52] the title deed right you got you can say
[1:42:55] that I bought this
[1:42:56] my house policemen are gonna drive them
[1:42:59] out and program says the same thing
[1:43:00] he's Satan's got to give it up because
[1:43:02] the Holy Spirit's there to make him do
[1:43:03] it the law of the land is to enforce its
[1:43:07] by the land for the land he said but the
[1:43:11] law of the Spirit of God is before Satan
[1:43:13] to give up that which he has
[1:43:15] unrightfully deceitfully taken from God
[1:43:19] souls of men he took from God souls of
[1:43:22] women children sickness of the body
[1:43:24] placed upon people where God made them
[1:43:26] in His image to be like him and the
[1:43:28] church is given the right for legal
[1:43:30] rights by the Bible
[1:43:31] to take the holy spirit and enforce this
[1:43:33] upon them hey man yeah now the only
[1:43:38] exception is like when Paul said God
[1:43:40] take these things from my eyes you know
[1:43:42] I'm buffing it was say and God said my
[1:43:44] grace is sufficient but see God still
[1:43:47] answered him right he's trying to take
[1:43:49] the Holy Spirit and force it but the
[1:43:50] Holy Spirit said no this is to humble
[1:43:52] you but he still tried to enforce it
[1:43:56] amen that's why we still try to pray for
[1:43:58] those that are sick those that are lost
[1:44:00] we keep praying and say let him go Saint
[1:44:02] let him go we don't know right with let
[1:44:04] us say the Lord we don't know but we
[1:44:06] keep trying to do it because one of
[1:44:08] these times it's gonna be the right time
[1:44:09] in season amen
[1:44:11] one of these times God will and force
[1:44:14] that command upon somebody amen one of
[1:44:18] these times that God will enforce the
[1:44:21] claim that work that we're claiming
[1:44:22] right God will enforce it it might be
[1:44:27] something God put a curse upon okay
[1:44:29] that's somebody right a few weeks ago
[1:44:30] there's times we don't take it off but
[1:44:33] that's where we got to make sure we ask
[1:44:34] before we I'm right there's times it
[1:44:37] might because you might get in trouble
[1:44:39] with God like like Moses smite she got
[1:44:41] in trouble with God he should not have
[1:44:42] done that that was against the Word of
[1:44:44] God so we have to make sure that before
[1:44:47] we take something off we ask the person
[1:44:49] about it all right so the thing to do is
[1:44:53] wait till you find the cause so many
[1:44:56] times in prayer we gotta make sure we
[1:44:58] find the cause of people's sins the
[1:45:01] cures already perfect if you can find
[1:45:03] the cause get rid of the kansai like if
[1:45:06] a car is laying somewhere like a piece
[1:45:08] of corn and a stick is laying over to
[1:45:09] make a girl
[1:45:10] just move this thick and it'll go
[1:45:12] straight that's the same thing it is see
[1:45:14] you've got to find the cause first find
[1:45:16] out what's making it do this now
[1:45:21] remember when that maniac fell over bow
[1:45:23] Rams feet
[1:45:24] the police said then when he fell down
[1:45:26] the police said it is he dead and RAM
[1:45:28] said no sir he said is he going to be
[1:45:30] all right he said no sir he worships
[1:45:32] that spirit now it's interesting Church
[1:45:35] is that when when when when Broder have
[1:45:37] said Satan come out of him Satan left
[1:45:39] him but the demons were still in him
[1:45:41] some demons were still in him because
[1:45:43] but I said Satan leave him Satan left
[1:45:45] but then the men the policeman asked is
[1:45:49] he all right he said no he still
[1:45:51] worships that spirit he thinks he's
[1:45:53] right if he's willing to give it up it
[1:45:55] would leave him now praise God but he
[1:46:00] worships it see so see brother Ram
[1:46:02] couldn't enforce the full cleansing of
[1:46:05] that man because he loved it but brother
[1:46:07] him could enforce his protection on the
[1:46:09] field he can enforce and say Satan leave
[1:46:15] him you're not gonna kill me you're six
[1:46:17] foot six or whatever you are you're not
[1:46:19] gonna kill me I enforced the claim of
[1:46:21] God's Word amen but he couldn't make
[1:46:25] those other demons leave because the man
[1:46:27] loved it so see you have to be careful
[1:46:30] how we enforce God's Word all right
[1:46:33] we'll stop right there let's say into
[1:46:34] our feet here what a wonderful time and
[1:46:36] the Lord had spent today how many enjoy
[1:46:38] the word tonight let's get a little
[1:46:39] round applause praise God thanks a lord
[1:46:42] next time we'll look at keeping and
[1:46:45] casting away the Bob's had cast your
[1:46:47] bread upon the waters toes he's more
[1:46:49] about saving and giving there's more
[1:46:51] season about saving and giving you got
[1:46:53] to cast it away cast it on the water
[1:46:56] have you ever put bread on the water
[1:46:58] have you ever fed ducks out in the water
[1:47:00] don't you feel like you're kind of
[1:47:02] wasting it you know like it gets all
[1:47:03] soggy but you know the Bible says cash
[1:47:05] right up on the water looks like I'm
[1:47:07] giving up all this what's gonna happen
[1:47:10] but God said it's going to come back to
[1:47:11] you it's going to come back how many
[1:47:14] witness to that
[1:47:15] and then we'll get to it next time Lord
[1:47:18] willing we keep the victory but there's
[1:47:21] times we fall short and we the Bible
[1:47:23] said cast not away your confidence but
[1:47:26] your Sisson there sometimes we cast away
[1:47:28] right Abraham cast it away he should
[1:47:31] have confidence I couldn't tell the
[1:47:34] Pharaoh she's my she's my wife because
[1:47:36] God will back me up
[1:47:37] but brother Brett but but brother
[1:47:38] Abraham cast it away and he lied and God
[1:47:42] was still merciful to him he did it
[1:47:44] twice God was still merciful because he
[1:47:47] was his prophet does he we go through
[1:47:50] seasons where we keep and cast away how
[1:47:53] many we've got to help you tonight God
[1:47:55] will help you let's get back this one
[1:47:56] God will help you if you've lost your
[1:47:58] joy if you've lost anything let's make
[1:48:01] this the season to get it back let's bow
[1:48:03] our heads musicians why'd you come here
[1:48:04] let's pray about that enforcing quote I
[1:48:07] think that's beautiful let's pray about
[1:48:10] that by God's grace we don't want anyone
[1:48:12] to leave here without getting the
[1:48:15] victory praise God there's there's never
[1:48:23] a sin Church that is the perfect will of
[1:48:25] God brother BAM even said in garna me
[1:48:27] and that was the permissive will of God
[1:48:29] God's perfect will was to bring forth
[1:48:30] children through spoken word so that
[1:48:33] teaches us every sin we do is the
[1:48:35] permissive will of God and God would
[1:48:37] rather have us get the victory that
[1:48:40] means our seasons of losing can be
[1:48:42] shorter we just kind of obey sooner it's
[1:48:45] always God's will to be sanctified it is
[1:48:47] always God's will to keep the Word of
[1:48:49] God and you can enforce that we can
[1:48:53] enforce that tonight I'm going to go
[1:48:57] back to that quote just so I can read it
[1:48:58] again you know as I pray here in just a
[1:49:01] moment
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:06] such a beautiful quote wasn't at church
[1:49:08] when it's attributed but ma'am said you
[1:49:16] can take the age and the Holy Spirit go
[1:49:18] right down on your knees see you have to
[1:49:20] go up to the altar just go down on your
[1:49:22] knees pray and say it's thus saith the
[1:49:25] Lord Satan's got to give it up it's the
[1:49:30] law of the land to enforce let me say

[1:49:36] heavens law to enforce his promise
