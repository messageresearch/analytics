[37:03] in the house the Lord it's going to
[37:07] first Peter chapter 1 verse 2 like to
[37:11] continue looking at Christ as the
[37:12] mystery of God revealed this would be
[37:14] part 3 and then Lord willing tonight
[37:17] we'll look at part 4
[37:29] so first Peter chapter 1 verse 2 Bible
[37:37] says elect according to the
[37:39] foreknowledge of God the Father through
[37:41] sanctification of the spirit unto
[37:44] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[37:46] Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be
[37:50] multiplied what a way to start a letter
[37:53] amen
[37:55] you are elect which the word elect means
[37:57] chosen you're chosen according to the
[38:01] foreknowledge of God and that is through
[38:05] being sanctified or washed of the Spirit
[38:08] unto us so when you're wash you can obey
[38:12] the Lord Amen and be sprinkled with the
[38:15] blood of Christ which we know sprinkling
[38:17] in the New Testament represents anointed
[38:19] connected to the Covenant how many glad
[38:21] to be connected to the covenant of
[38:23] Abraham Amen praise God go to Romans
[38:27] chapter 8 please verse 29 we'll just
[38:30] read one more this will be our last
[38:31] portion of text here and then I haven't
[38:41] had many quotes to show lately but I do
[38:44] have quotes to show today by God's
[38:47] graces haven't had the time I've had a
[38:50] little more time recently so Romans 8:29
[38:53] by God's grace let's read this one
[38:55] together just verse 29 on three one two
[38:58] three four whom he did foreknow he also
[39:02] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[39:05] image of his son that he might be the
[39:08] firstborn among many brethren amen how
[39:12] many want to be conformed to Christ
[39:13] image you want your life to be molded to
[39:17] be more like Christ to look like
[39:20] Christ's life looked on this earth let's
[39:23] just have a word of Prayer as we go
[39:25] before him and if you have that need
[39:26] just raise your hand or symbolize it
[39:28] some way to the Lord Heavenly Father we
[39:31] just bow our heads to you Lord God we we
[39:33] lift our hands to heaven O God as we
[39:36] know Solomon did when he dedicated the
[39:38] temple Lord he
[39:39] the Bible says he fell on his knees and
[39:41] lifted his hands to heaven Oh God and
[39:43] cried out to You Lord God and so Lord
[39:46] we're not Lord here at a natural temple
[39:49] dedicating a natural temple but we went
[39:51] our temples of our bodies to be freshly
[39:54] dedicated to you Lord God we went our
[39:56] our lives conform to your image shaped
[40:00] molded lured fastened the Lord to be
[40:04] more like you dear God
[40:06] mould us and shape us change us Oh God
[40:08] nor may we go from glory to glory from
[40:11] faith to faith little by little give us
[40:13] the victory Lord over every foe Lord in
[40:16] our body every temptation Lord every
[40:19] mind battle every disease every sickness
[40:21] Lord little by little give us the
[40:23] victory Lord and we'll certainly praise
[40:25] you and glorify you we're here to be
[40:27] sanctified we're here to be sprinkled or
[40:30] we're here
[40:30] Lorne according to the foreknowledge of
[40:32] God we ask that you speak to us here
[40:34] this morning father meet every need we
[40:36] pray we've lifted up many already but
[40:38] Lord for those we haven't lifted up we
[40:40] lift them up in the name of Jesus Oh God
[40:43] and may you be glorified in this service
[40:44] in Jesus Christ's name the church said
[40:47] amen god bless you being seated praise
[40:49] God and Malachi you can no or later you
[40:53] can switch over it's not the HDMI it's
[40:56] the VGA one so it's the different one
[41:00] like to look at that so I want to
[41:04] continue this little thought on Christ
[41:07] is the mystery of God revealed and in
[41:09] this message as I've been listening to
[41:11] it the last couple weeks
[41:12] this thought on predestination keeps
[41:15] coming up and so I like to deal with
[41:17] predestination election and
[41:19] foreknowledge this morning and tonight
[41:22] we'll look at revelation by the grace of
[41:24] God because those are the main themes
[41:26] that the Prophet teaches here as he
[41:29] preaches Christ the mystery of God
[41:31] revealed has anyone listening to it
[41:32] lately okay a couple half okay
[41:35] praise God amen so I trust up these
[41:37] things that will be said will be further
[41:40] strengthened and further edified to you
[41:42] by the grace of Lord I just couldn't
[41:44] seem to get away from it you know I had
[41:45] much study time all week I had a couple
[41:47] days off from work there I just couldn't
[41:49] get away from this I feel like the Holy
[41:51] Spirit's directing us here
[41:53] to teach this by the grace of the Lord
[41:56] praise God so just part of me here just
[41:58] a moment we like to look at this thought
[42:01] and it's been a while since I preached
[42:04] on predestination we looked a little bit
[42:05] at it on a Wednesday night in part two
[42:08] but let's look at Part three here today
[42:12] now I want to just start with these
[42:14] quotes that really inspired me as I've
[42:17] been listening to the Prophet preached
[42:18] this message he says now he said oh the
[42:22] great revelation now to restore back his
[42:24] kinship that's his family
[42:26] how many his kinship this morning to
[42:29] bring back now he had to let them get
[42:31] lost you understand it he had to let
[42:34] them sin put them on free moral which he
[42:37] means agency he could not make them sin
[42:40] and remain God and then punished them
[42:45] for something he made them do how many
[42:48] how many thankful that God is a just God
[42:50] and this goes to us this applies to you
[42:54] and I this applies to sinners God cannot
[42:57] make you and I sin and then punish us
[43:01] for what something he made us do that's
[43:03] the beauty and the power of free more
[43:06] agency amen
[43:08] now when we make computers or we make
[43:11] machines we program and tell them what
[43:13] to do at least right now I know there's
[43:16] a lot of science fiction where they you
[43:18] know they give artificial intelligence
[43:20] to robots it and they can choose for
[43:22] themselves but but not so at least of
[43:24] yet but God was able to accomplish that
[43:29] because he's all-powerful he gave human
[43:32] beings free more agency where you choose
[43:36] whatever you desire and so God in this
[43:39] case if we look at we think about
[43:41] sinners like like Judas God didn't make
[43:44] Judas betray Jesus Judas wanted to do it
[43:48] it was his free more agency like Pharaoh
[43:53] in the days of Moses God didn't make him
[43:56] harden his heart
[43:57] but God knew he would harden his heart
[43:59] right God even sent him thus saith the
[44:02] Lord and told him what to do but he kept
[44:05] turning it down and so
[44:07] on the day of judgment no one will be
[44:09] able to look and say well you made me do
[44:11] it God will say no I gave you free more
[44:13] agency you could have chosen the good
[44:16] but you chose the evil of course so look
[44:19] at the bride we won't have to stand
[44:21] there in front of him we'll be sitting
[44:22] with him amen
[44:23] and I'll say these are the ones they
[44:25] meant that chose to do what's right and
[44:28] they are the same choice as you and I
[44:30] didn't force them but they chose me amen
[44:33] that's right if not they could say well
[44:36] you're an adjuster you forced me into
[44:39] this and I'm God to say I did not force
[44:41] I gave you the choice like everyone else
[44:44] and so he said God never just said well
[44:48] I'll choose this one and that one I'll
[44:50] choose a men and who an heir but I won't
[44:52] choose this one the center out on the
[44:54] street last night at the bar he didn't
[44:56] do that but he knew by reason the reason
[45:00] he could predestinate or predetermined
[45:02] was because he's infinite and so being
[45:05] infinite he knows everything he know the
[45:07] end it could tell the end from the
[45:09] beginning
[45:09] he's got if he can't do that he's not
[45:12] God yes sir he's infinite praise God so
[45:16] God didn't choose us because you know he
[45:18] liked our smile better than someone
[45:20] else's or he liked our our attitude or
[45:23] he thought we were just more handsome or
[45:26] more beautiful than someone else here
[45:27] God didn't show chooses by that God
[45:31] chose us by foreknowledge and so I want
[45:35] to just show the order from the Bible on
[45:37] his predestination how many believe your
[45:40] life has been predestined amen I believe
[45:43] mine has but there's actually something
[45:45] there's two steps that took place before
[45:47] God even predestinated all the events of
[45:50] your life there's two things that
[45:52] already took place the first that took
[45:55] place before predestination the first in
[45:57] that Mary took place was God foreknew
[46:00] the choice you would make and after God
[46:04] foresaw your choice then he could elect
[46:07] you or choose you and this is Scripture
[46:11] this is the Bible teaching this is not
[46:13] my idea this is not a new doctrine I'm
[46:15] just pulling the same Bible doctrine on
[46:18] the Bible and pointing it out to
[46:20] everybody
[46:21] because it was fresh to me it was an it
[46:23] was new I felt my this message Christ
[46:26] mister God revealed has given me more
[46:28] revelation on predestination that I had
[46:30] before praise God and I'm thankful for
[46:32] that
[46:33] and remember just a more simple way to
[46:35] explain that title is Jesus is God's
[46:38] mystery unveiled can I say like that God
[46:41] had a great mystery in his mind and that
[46:43] revealed mystery was Christ Christ was
[46:47] the mystery that God had been hiding for
[46:50] the four thousand years and when they
[46:52] saw Jesus they saw God's mystery amen
[46:55] and today when people see you as a real
[46:58] Christian they're seeing God's mystery
[47:00] of today revealed in front of them
[47:02] hallelujah amen that's right I know it's
[47:05] hard for us to believe because we fall
[47:07] short and we stumble we make mistakes
[47:10] but behind it all when you ask God to
[47:12] forgive you and then you get power to do
[47:14] what's right the next time and power for
[47:17] God to manifest his light through you
[47:19] you are the feeder of the hands of
[47:21] Christ you are the feed in Christ you're
[47:24] the very expression of the original
[47:26] interpretation of the Word of God
[47:28] you are God's thoughts Express they may
[47:31] Amen it's exactly right I know we don't
[47:35] feel like it looked like it and we wake
[47:36] up and we don't feel like it all the
[47:38] time but when we are walking in the
[47:40] spirit of course all the time but when
[47:42] we're walking in the spirit obeying the
[47:44] word of God we are shining the light to
[47:47] this dark world and people look at us
[47:49] and people see that we are real
[47:51] Christians they men truly manifesting
[47:55] Jesus Christ of this world so when we
[47:58] say yes God has predestinated in my life
[48:00] that's true but two things actually
[48:02] happened before that God had
[48:05] foreknowledge of your choice and then he
[48:07] chose you and he chose the time period
[48:10] you would live in a man either there we
[48:13] go we'll get to that we'll prove that by
[48:15] the Bible because all the disciples
[48:17] asked is this the time when when Israel
[48:19] is going to get ruling over at Rome and
[48:21] all these things and Jesus said it's not
[48:23] for you to know the times and seasons
[48:25] that God has placed in his hand
[48:28] amen the election is God choosing the
[48:32] age you would live in choosing when you
[48:34] would live choosing you for a certain
[48:37] calling whether a male for a certain
[48:39] calling as a man or a female certain
[48:41] calling imposition and gifts as a female
[48:44] God chose that aspect of it but that was
[48:47] after he saw that you would love him
[48:50] hey hallelujah but there says listen to
[48:54] this predestination looks back he said
[48:58] to election which is that's what he says
[49:01] he changed it he corrects the election
[49:02] an election looks back to foreknowledge
[49:05] and the church said I'm not making this
[49:08] up this is what the program taught God
[49:12] has predetermined here the events of
[49:15] your life for you to receive him and
[49:19] love him but before that he elected you
[49:23] or chose you and he chose you based upon
[49:26] his foreknowledge of if you would love
[49:30] him or not amen
[49:32] hallelujah and this is what the Bible
[49:35] said this was our taxi you are elected
[49:38] according to what what are you elected
[49:40] according to God's foreknowledge amen
[49:45] and I trust that the Holy Spirit will
[49:47] make this deep subject so simple that
[49:50] everybody can receive it this morning
[49:52] that doesn't have to say well I'm
[49:54] checking out brother disappear only 10
[49:56] minutes in your sermon I'm checking out
[49:57] I can't catch this humble yourself each
[50:01] one of us should humble ourselves and
[50:02] say God make it so real to me that I can
[50:04] catch it help me to see how simple this
[50:07] is because it really is simple this
[50:10] doesn't have to be a deep thing in fact
[50:12] brother Branham says the Holy Spirit
[50:13] takes deep deep things that seem
[50:16] complicated and makes them so simple
[50:20] that's what I'm trusting the Holy Spirit
[50:22] would do for you this morning because if
[50:24] you can catch this revelation church it
[50:26] will make you live differently this has
[50:29] helped me live differently just in the
[50:31] last week or so because I'm in a mindset
[50:34] now it's the mindset that I'm living in
[50:37] and I've got that hopefully I can closer
[50:40] that it's the mindset that we're living
[50:42] in
[50:42] and that mindset drives every decision
[50:45] you make so see you are elected you were
[50:52] chosen based upon the foreknowledge of
[50:55] God and then of course you get
[50:56] sanctified by the spirit and then you
[50:58] obey the Word of God because you're
[51:01] sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:03] which is the anointing of the Holy
[51:04] Spirit you're connected member Moses had
[51:07] to sprinkle the people and join them to
[51:09] the Covenant you're under the Covenant
[51:10] of the law you're joined by the blood
[51:13] and so have you been anointed you're
[51:15] joined to the the New Testament the
[51:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost the covenant
[51:20] of grace a heavy not coming over but
[51:23] you're sprinkled for the covenant of
[51:24] grace in other words God God is going to
[51:27] give you grace God is going to keep his
[51:29] promise to you God is going to keep you
[51:31] under the New Testament amen because the
[51:34] Covenant means a promise he's going to
[51:36] keep his promise to you amen
[51:38] because his blood was shed for you his
[51:40] life was paid for you and you are
[51:42] connected to it you're sprinkled with it
[51:45] and it's part of you amen and you're a
[51:46] part of it amen so see election looks
[51:51] back to foreknowledge the Bible says and
[51:54] then we read in our other text for whom
[51:57] he did foreknow he also did predestinate
[52:02] because God foreknew you he could
[52:05] predestinate the events of your life
[52:07] amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus he
[52:13] could predetermine praise God he could
[52:17] predetermine all the events of your life
[52:19] because he foreknew that you'd love him
[52:22] that's right and see according as he had
[52:26] chosen us in him so the choosing is the
[52:28] election that's actually what the word
[52:30] election means chosen you're chosen by
[52:33] God he has chosen us in him where in his
[52:36] mind before the foundation of the world
[52:39] that we should be holy and without blame
[52:41] before him in love God loves us God's
[52:46] not upset with us does he get does he
[52:50] have to sometimes chasing us of course
[52:52] you have to sometimes correct your
[52:53] children yes but
[52:55] as the perfect love God doesn't get
[52:58] upset in and disappointed in us God
[53:01] loves us having he chose us having
[53:05] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[53:08] children so this is what God has
[53:10] ultimately predestinated you to to be
[53:13] adopted into his family amen glory
[53:16] hallelujah
[53:18] remember adoption was different adoption
[53:20] and those days just meant you had the
[53:23] full authority of the of your parents
[53:25] your name on the check was as good as
[53:28] your parents other words God that
[53:29] parents could could could you were
[53:32] responsible you were trustworthy with
[53:35] the parents resources and so does Christ
[53:37] today he we are trustworthy with the
[53:40] word with this spirit we just won't say
[53:44] thus saith the Lord we just won't guess
[53:46] about things we'll wait till we have
[53:48] something or we won't say nothing at all
[53:50] amen
[53:51] God's got to trust us with his word amen
[53:54] but this is what he's predetermined that
[53:57] we would be adopted and come to a place
[54:00] of maturity as a sudden daughter of
[54:03] Christ according to the good pleasure of
[54:06] his will
[54:07] so see God starts with foreknowledge god
[54:11] knows each person's final choice about
[54:13] Jesus Christ and free more agency he
[54:16] cannot punish sinners for making them
[54:18] sin so it has to start with his
[54:21] foreknowledge of whether they're going
[54:24] to accept or not and then comes the
[54:27] election god elects or chooses those he
[54:29] for knows will choose him God will not
[54:32] force anyone to serve him but yet he
[54:35] desires all would be saved but the Bible
[54:38] says many are called but few are chosen
[54:41] sees everybody they get the call they
[54:43] get the call but few are chosen or too
[54:46] few are elected because he knows those
[54:49] that will receive it and that those it
[54:50] won't and then because he's elected them
[54:54] he's chosen them out of each age then he
[54:56] predestinate their lives according to
[54:59] his purpose or his will amen
[55:04] you know I
[55:05] I think about this often you know I
[55:07] thought you know I really wish I could
[55:10] have been raised in the message I think
[55:12] about because I could have lived a
[55:13] holier life but you know sometimes we
[55:16] look back at our lives and think well I
[55:18] might have to wait till I was 19 to be
[55:21] saved why did I just serve God younger
[55:23] you know what I have to do this sir and
[55:25] we think about the events of our lives
[55:27] but but we have to understand that God
[55:29] has predetermined all the events in our
[55:32] lives God and think of this thing about
[55:35] saw will look at saw tonight the Saint
[55:37] Paul god had to let him learn all these
[55:40] Jewish memorization and Jewish facts and
[55:44] details about ceremonial laws by the
[55:47] Amen that later he would all forget and
[55:50] say they're done God let him spend years
[55:53] and years and years memorizing beating
[55:56] his body he said I was zealous I was the
[55:58] muhib room Hebrews I was the most
[56:00] zealous of all of them and God let him
[56:03] beat himself and memorize all these
[56:06] denominational lies for years and years
[56:08] and years and God just let it go because
[56:11] God was not in any hurry
[56:13] God had predestinated a Damascus Road
[56:16] experience for him and God had to let
[56:18] them experience all these years and
[56:20] decades of all this there's this human
[56:24] training in order that when he got saved
[56:27] he would be a real fireball for Christ
[56:29] amen because he would know I've spent
[56:32] all these years under my own human
[56:35] ability I've given my life and my energy
[56:38] I've given everything in this false
[56:40] system but now I found life amen and now
[56:44] I can devote myself fully to the true
[56:47] and living God's purpose now I can look
[56:49] in a real living message the message of
[56:52] the hour and now I live differently
[56:54] because of what I experienced they know
[56:59] and the Bible said that Paul labored
[57:03] more than all the Apostles who actually
[57:06] walked with Jesus he spent more
[57:10] I'm praying he spent more time preaching
[57:12] he spent more time traveling than all
[57:15] the Apostles and he never even saw Jesus
[57:18] in a flesh body he just saw him in a
[57:20] pillar of fire ha ha ha
[57:22] amen and that beautiful his testimony
[57:27] had to be different God allowed him all
[57:31] these things and he cannot and he he
[57:33] might have thought you know for a while
[57:35] why did I have to stand there and watch
[57:36] Stephen died he had to do it because he
[57:39] had to know the sufferings he had to he
[57:42] had to experience that so he would know
[57:44] the sufferings Christians went through
[57:46] that he himself could suffer and learn
[57:49] to be like Christ amen hallelujah and he
[57:55] had to have those memories of of being a
[57:58] part of the martyrs and dragging people
[58:00] off to jail and trying to get them to
[58:02] blaspheme in order service motivation
[58:05] that he will work even harder than that
[58:08] as hard as he worked for the devil they
[58:11] used God love that that be his
[58:13] motivation to work harder for Christ
[58:16] amen hallelujah amen thank the Lord
[58:24] so church we have to we have to just
[58:26] trust how many trust that God
[58:28] predestinated everything at the right
[58:30] time in your life amen
[58:34] it's his purpose and his will the timing
[58:39] was perfect like with Moses 40 years you
[58:41] would have thought he's 40 years old I'm
[58:43] almost 40 I'm 38 you would have thought
[58:45] Moses I'm 40 I'm ready to take Israel
[58:48] out and God said no I've got to take 40
[58:51] years and beat all that Audia you cannot
[58:54] trust and your hue and your human
[58:56] military organizational skills you can't
[58:59] trust even in your physical strength you
[59:01] can't trust in your youth you've got to
[59:03] trust only a one thing thus saith the
[59:05] Lord from the Holy Spirit
[59:07] that's the same thing we've got to trust
[59:09] in amen we've got to learn to trust in
[59:11] the Word of God from the Holy Spirit and
[59:14] it will never fail amen
[59:16] you'll never pass away hallelujah amen
[59:21] but see we might write our stories
[59:23] differently but God is the great author
[59:25] and I like what brother Troy said he's
[59:27] coming back in junior but like we said
[59:29] God only wrote one book and it was
[59:31] called life the book of life amen
[59:35] and God orchestrated our lives for his
[59:38] purpose and for his glory so here's the
[59:44] one I already read and then I read this
[59:46] one now I'm sure I have I read this one
[59:48] on Wednesday he put man on partnership
[59:50] with him that let that man act as a free
[59:53] more Asian the same thing he's got you
[59:54] on today did you know God wants to be
[59:57] partner with you has anyone ever done to
[1:00:00] a partner business here
[1:00:01] I've never have but it takes a lot of
[1:00:04] confidence if we're gonna have a
[1:00:05] partnership in a business well you've
[1:00:07] all made many of you have taken a
[1:00:08] partnership in marriage that's good
[1:00:10] praise the Lord for that
[1:00:12] but God Berlin says the way we
[1:00:15] understand our relationship with God is
[1:00:16] that he makes us partners he's not
[1:00:18] forcing us well you've got to work for
[1:00:20] me
[1:00:21] Jesse you've got to work for me Tonya
[1:00:22] you've got to work for me bang no he's
[1:00:24] not forcing you into this he said if you
[1:00:26] want to be a part of this you're welcome
[1:00:29] to be a part of this and how many glad
[1:00:31] you sign the dotted line amen
[1:00:33] I sign the dotted line but the contract
[1:00:36] was already signed with the blood of
[1:00:38] Jesus Christ amen I just sighed and said
[1:00:41] I believe that amen same thing he's got
[1:00:45] you on today for your more agency you
[1:00:47] can act any way you want to you're free
[1:00:49] more agent so therefore if we put the
[1:00:51] first like that he has to put the second
[1:00:53] like that yes but everybody like that or
[1:00:55] he acted wrong in the first place but
[1:00:56] everybody is on the same basis and the
[1:00:58] church said Adolph Hitler was on the
[1:01:01] same basis right he lived in the 40s so
[1:01:04] did brother Branham during the world war
[1:01:06] they're both alive they're on the same
[1:01:08] basis they both could have choosen to
[1:01:10] chose right and wrong but we know Adolf
[1:01:12] Hitler chose the tree of knowledge of
[1:01:13] good and evil and brother Ram chose the
[1:01:15] tree of life amen
[1:01:17] they're both on the same basis just like
[1:01:19] Adam and Eve we both have a choice today
[1:01:21] you have the same choices today either
[1:01:24] partake of life or partake of the
[1:01:26] knowledge of good and evil let us
[1:01:27] partake of Christ our life amen
[1:01:31] and this is one I wrote to her god never
[1:01:34] said I'll just choose that what I'll
[1:01:35] choose that one God chooses his people
[1:01:41] by foreknowledge not by his desire
[1:01:47] buh-bam says by his foreknowledge he
[1:01:50] predestinated these things that happen
[1:01:52] he chooses his own person by his
[1:01:55] foreknowledge not by his discrimination
[1:02:00] you know he doesn't discriminate I'm
[1:02:02] choosing more blacks and whites or I'm
[1:02:04] choosing more Asians and blacks or and
[1:02:06] it's not by that it's by foreknowledge
[1:02:09] hey man
[1:02:10] like he said in Romans 9 he says with
[1:02:13] Esau and Jacob both born the holy
[1:02:15] parents and twins that the election
[1:02:17] might stand sure and he said I hated
[1:02:19] Esau and Jacob have I loved before
[1:02:21] either boy was born he knows what's in
[1:02:24] man he knowed it from the beginning what
[1:02:26] it was there for he could make
[1:02:28] everything work just exactly on clock
[1:02:30] time we get all nervous and frustrated
[1:02:33] you never seen him frustrated they don't
[1:02:36] see everything's working all right just
[1:02:38] exactly the clocks tickin let me say let
[1:02:41] me remind you my mother said the rapture
[1:02:42] will not be one second late amen if you
[1:02:47] go on the rapture you won't be late for
[1:02:49] you won't be early for you'll be right
[1:02:52] on time amen
[1:02:53] because God has predestinated all these
[1:02:55] events he's all lined them up the
[1:02:58] clock's ticking perfectly in other words
[1:03:00] the bride of Jesus Christ is right where
[1:03:02] she needs to be there's no condemnation
[1:03:04] to them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:03:06] she's right where she needs to be she's
[1:03:08] finishing the Great Commission and God
[1:03:10] is making her more into his own image of
[1:03:13] his son amen he knows what's in man he
[1:03:17] knows what's in your heart this morning
[1:03:18] I'm glad he knows what's in my heart
[1:03:21] amen because I'm not hiding he sins in
[1:03:24] my heart if I sin I say God forgive me I
[1:03:26] want my heart to be pure please God now
[1:03:31] here's this this is gonna help us God
[1:03:33] know the end from the beginning
[1:03:34] therefore he could plan everything I
[1:03:36] know what they're gonna choose I know
[1:03:38] what that one's gonna choose I know it's
[1:03:40] in their heart
[1:03:41] okay so I'll plan this like this
[1:03:44] he said that it would just work out for
[1:03:46] his glory and that gives us what courage
[1:03:49] now here's what I said on Wednesday I
[1:03:52] said most people in the message or we
[1:03:54] say most people in churches they get
[1:03:56] lazy on God because they hear so much
[1:03:58] that God loves them God loves them and
[1:04:00] they're saved and they're saved but see
[1:04:02] predestinated predestination to me
[1:04:05] doesn't make me lazy it actually makes
[1:04:08] me want to work more for Christ because
[1:04:11] brother Branham said it gives you
[1:04:13] courage to know that no matter what
[1:04:15] comes or goes God is making everything
[1:04:17] the clock is ticking just exactly on
[1:04:20] time so so often people take that
[1:04:24] attitude well if I'm gonna go in the
[1:04:26] rapture I'll be there there's nothing I
[1:04:27] can do about it no there is something
[1:04:29] you can do about it
[1:04:30] jesus said the Holy Ghost is like water
[1:04:33] and he said him that's thirsty come let
[1:04:36] him drink of the Living Waters of life
[1:04:39] whosoever will then drink of the lawyers
[1:04:42] of life freely
[1:04:43] everybody's offered the Holy Ghost we've
[1:04:45] just got to reach out and confess all of
[1:04:48] our sins and make our way push our way
[1:04:50] elbow only to that whale and drink of
[1:04:53] the whale everybody can make it there
[1:04:55] you've just got to do it amen you just
[1:04:58] gotta want it you'll see this doesn't
[1:05:02] make us lazy it makes us courageous no
[1:05:05] matter what comes or goes God planned
[1:05:07] everything and in every situation I know
[1:05:10] what to do keep the word this ain't
[1:05:14] rocket science I know God has ordained
[1:05:16] everything in my life and in every
[1:05:18] situation I also go through it look at
[1:05:20] the situation and say what would Jesus
[1:05:22] do what would the word do what does the
[1:05:25] word say about this and I promise you
[1:05:27] Church I believe it's true if you'll
[1:05:29] pray about it long enough when you've
[1:05:31] got two choices
[1:05:32] I believe God will show you the clearest
[1:05:33] choice camisa can say like this he'll
[1:05:37] show you the perfect choice because the
[1:05:40] Bible said you can prove the perfect
[1:05:41] will of God
[1:05:44] sometimes we get weary and upset don't
[1:05:47] we Church thank God first forgiveness we
[1:05:50] get hastily well that's me right there I
[1:05:51] just want I want to get everything done
[1:05:53] right now let's get this whole series
[1:05:55] done took this morning you know
[1:05:56] I'll preach for hours he said oh we
[1:05:59] think we must do this or must do that
[1:06:01] remember God's clock will be just
[1:06:03] exactly on time all these things has to
[1:06:05] be this way it all has to be done
[1:06:09] according to his great knowledge his
[1:06:10] foreknowledge
[1:06:11] for by foreknowledge he could
[1:06:13] predestinate not by his desire but by
[1:06:16] his knowledge
[1:06:18] God doesn't predestinate my desire
[1:06:20] because he's not willing that any should
[1:06:22] perish if you listen to Wednesday's
[1:06:25] service I ended the service with three
[1:06:26] scriptures that show God does not
[1:06:29] delight in wicked people perishing God
[1:06:31] wasn't shouting yes we're so happy that
[1:06:34] Sodom and Gomorrah was burnt the Bible
[1:06:36] said God doesn't rejoice in that he has
[1:06:39] to do it as a just judge but he doesn't
[1:06:41] get pleasure in that and the brother
[1:06:44] says he's not willing God doesn't want
[1:06:46] anyone to perish by his foreknowledge he
[1:06:50] knew who would accept and who would not
[1:06:52] therefore he can make everything work
[1:06:53] according to his big-time clock that's
[1:06:55] ticking away and he could foretell the
[1:06:57] end from the beginning and therefore he
[1:06:59] knew that we would live in this day and
[1:07:01] he knew that this would be our day whose
[1:07:05] day is this your day hey man it's been a
[1:07:12] but man said he had plans for this day
[1:07:14] he had plans for every day and never as
[1:07:16] one of his plans ever failed he's always
[1:07:18] on time I just want to encourage you
[1:07:20] that God's plans for your life cannot
[1:07:23] fail amen
[1:07:24] they can't fail amen if he's brought you
[1:07:27] this for the Bible said he's faithful
[1:07:29] and just to finish the work that he
[1:07:31] started amen his word can't fail we've
[1:07:36] got to make sure our minds and our
[1:07:37] attitudes don't fail that's what we've
[1:07:39] got to make sure because his plans and
[1:07:41] his ways will never fail but we've got
[1:07:44] to make sure we keep our minds right
[1:07:46] according to the Word of God never has
[1:07:51] his plans ever failed he was always on
[1:07:54] time when our names was placed on the
[1:07:56] blast book of life when when the lamb
[1:07:58] was slain before the foundation of world
[1:08:00] the mind of God when God was Jehovah ll
[1:08:02] ah Elohim the self-existent one just
[1:08:05] like one great big diamond and he could
[1:08:07] not be nothing else but inside this
[1:08:09] diamond his
[1:08:10] a tribute was a savior in his attributes
[1:08:12] on the inside of him he was the healer
[1:08:14] well there's been nothing to save and
[1:08:16] nothing to heal but his attributes
[1:08:18] produced it so then before the
[1:08:22] foundation of the world when he knowed
[1:08:24] that that the great display in here of
[1:08:28] him that he would be a savior that he
[1:08:30] would come and be made flesh and dwelt
[1:08:31] among us and he know by His stripes we'd
[1:08:33] be healed he slay the lamb on his book
[1:08:36] before the foundation of the world and
[1:08:38] wrote your name on that book before the
[1:08:41] foundation of the world
[1:08:42] oh my because God foreknew he could
[1:08:46] choose and he could predestinate and
[1:08:48] where'd he do it he wrote it down in the
[1:08:51] book of life amen
[1:08:52] hallelujah it's exactly right
[1:08:55] remember your name is on that book
[1:08:57] because Jesus said those that don't
[1:08:59] repent I'll block their name off the
[1:09:01] book your names on that book the name of
[1:09:04] Jesse Smith from the Laodicean Church
[1:09:06] age is on that book and I believe it's
[1:09:09] written in blood red ink amen hallelujah
[1:09:12] shows yours
[1:09:14] because we we how do you know because
[1:09:16] our lives long for the word our lives
[1:09:19] express the word all eyes love the word
[1:09:22] our lives speak of Jesus Christ the same
[1:09:25] yesterday today and forever and we don't
[1:09:29] deny one word that's written in this
[1:09:30] book
[1:09:30] praise God which every other Church in
[1:09:32] denomination do right they pick and
[1:09:35] choose and they let people be sinners
[1:09:37] and call them Saints when they're not in
[1:09:39] order to be a saint you've got to be
[1:09:41] sanctified that's what our scripture
[1:09:42] said the beginning you got to be
[1:09:44] sanctified by the Spirit amen
[1:09:46] then you're a saint praise God
[1:09:49] what have said listen to this are you
[1:09:52] listening predestination look back to
[1:09:54] for now I mentioned this earlier and I
[1:09:58] mean election election looks back to for
[1:09:59] now it's predestination looks the
[1:10:00] destiny now destiny is a part of
[1:10:03] predestination so that's why I didn't
[1:10:04] put that on the previous slide I believe
[1:10:06] it's the same thing because
[1:10:07] predestination destiny is right in
[1:10:09] predestination don't forget that that
[1:10:12] election looks back here now brother
[1:10:14] random corrects this later but look what
[1:10:16] he says he's trying to just show an
[1:10:17] illustration he said I was a cocklebur
[1:10:20] which is like a thorny bush I was born
[1:10:22] in sin shaped iniquity come
[1:10:24] the world speaking lies born among
[1:10:25] sinners father and mother all my whole
[1:10:27] life family sinners I was the cocklebur
[1:10:29] but all of a sudden I became a wheat
[1:10:31] grain brother lamb corrects us later he
[1:10:34] says how happened what is that election
[1:10:37] in other words you used to be a sinner
[1:10:39] but at some point you became a Christian
[1:10:42] praise God now but Rev said God before
[1:10:45] the foundation world elected that the
[1:10:48] kokuboro was to become a grain of wheat
[1:10:49] now he's going to correct that because
[1:10:51] you can't change the seed so he fixes us
[1:10:54] later on his message you can't change
[1:10:56] the seat in fact whatever seeds inside
[1:10:59] of you and you were born or before
[1:11:00] you're born that seeds still manifesting
[1:11:02] today amen whatever that just proves to
[1:11:06] me that I always wanted to serve God
[1:11:08] even though I didn't know about the
[1:11:09] message if I if I could have heard it I
[1:11:12] would have believed it amen even as a
[1:11:14] child because I believe it now and the
[1:11:16] seed inside of me is proving that I
[1:11:19] believe the word I believe the message
[1:11:21] so that seed was always deep down inside
[1:11:23] of me praise God amen and no man put it
[1:11:26] there but God put it there big man how
[1:11:32] do it know I know I'm a great a week
[1:11:33] because I'm saying how do I do it look
[1:11:35] back and see that he has predestinated
[1:11:37] it a long time ago bye for now this is
[1:11:41] the quarrel of by foreknowledge he's
[1:11:44] seen that I would love him hallelujah
[1:11:48] so he made a propitiation through his
[1:11:52] own son that through him I might be
[1:11:54] coming from a kokuboro to a grain of
[1:11:56] wheat now where may I'm saved I'm
[1:11:58] walking in the grace of God so God in
[1:12:01] his mind looked down through all the
[1:12:02] timelines or can you think of the
[1:12:04] timelines of our history through this
[1:12:06] six thousand years god looked down and
[1:12:08] saw who will love me and so he started
[1:12:11] out the beginning with Adam and Eve and
[1:12:12] he saw had him and he would love him and
[1:12:14] he saw that Cain would not love him
[1:12:17] praise God but he saw Abel would love
[1:12:20] him so he revealed to Abel that you need
[1:12:24] to bring a sacrifice of blood because he
[1:12:27] knew Abel would love him but then Cain
[1:12:31] was given the same instruction and Kate
[1:12:34] said I'm not gonna do all that messy
[1:12:35] stuff I'm not gonna shout and dancing
[1:12:37] speak in tongues and and cry and weep
[1:12:39] and snot the altar I'm not going to do
[1:12:41] that but God offered it to him and both
[1:12:45] Cain and Abel manifested this seed that
[1:12:47] was inside the true seed of God gladly
[1:12:51] obeyed the word and died for the word
[1:12:54] with the seed of the enemy the seed of
[1:12:56] the serpent hated the word disrespected
[1:13:00] it walked away from it murdered his
[1:13:02] brother
[1:13:03] but God foreknew that he saw Abel would
[1:13:06] love him and Abel would love the blood
[1:13:08] so do you and I love the blood I know
[1:13:12] yeah so do we love the blood of Jesus
[1:13:15] Christ today amen
[1:13:18] he's seen that I would love him so he
[1:13:21] made a propitiation through his own son
[1:13:24] so God was looking who is gonna in the
[1:13:27] free moral agency who is gonna choose to
[1:13:31] love me
[1:13:32] and I thought that before I got married
[1:13:34] I said wonder who's gonna be my wife I
[1:13:36] wonder who will just I don't want to
[1:13:39] force a woman to love me you better love
[1:13:41] me and you better not divorce me I
[1:13:44] didn't want to force somebody I wanted
[1:13:46] someone to freely choose to love me I'm
[1:13:49] thankful my wife does amen that's why we
[1:13:52] don't like those arranged marriages that
[1:13:54] some cultures doing some people because
[1:13:57] they'll get people together that that
[1:13:58] don't love each other by the free moral
[1:14:01] agency and God were the same thing he
[1:14:04] said I like somebody who loved me but
[1:14:06] they've said God did not plan his
[1:14:09] Redemption say well perhaps somebody
[1:14:11] will love me so I'll send my son Jesus
[1:14:14] but I've said God does not do his
[1:14:16] business like that remember I said you
[1:14:18] don't either when you can start a
[1:14:20] business you don't think well maybe this
[1:14:21] business will work before you start that
[1:14:24] business you know it's going to work you
[1:14:26] know there's a need for that for that
[1:14:28] service or that product whatever you're
[1:14:31] producing whether it's apples or
[1:14:33] whatever it is I know people need apples
[1:14:35] and so I'm investing in a wise decision
[1:14:38] I know there's a need and that's how God
[1:14:40] did God said I know and lanta see yeah
[1:14:43] there's going to be some people in Akron
[1:14:44] Ohio that will love
[1:14:48] I'm not just gonna guess and maybe
[1:14:50] there's somebody over in Akron or maybe
[1:14:52] there's somebody in over there in Ohio
[1:14:53] that is serving to hope somebody loves
[1:14:55] me he didn't hope so he knew so amen and
[1:14:58] because of that he ordained the events
[1:15:01] of your life to come across the light of
[1:15:03] the hour and when the light and water
[1:15:05] flashed upon that see it got born again
[1:15:08] amen and they came to life hallelujah
[1:15:12] because he said I know he'll love me I
[1:15:15] know he won't serve me by legalism I
[1:15:18] know she won't serve me by fear just
[1:15:20] sure she'll serve me because she loves
[1:15:22] me
[1:15:23] she trusts my word that's the kind of
[1:15:26] woman I'm looking for someone that will
[1:15:28] love me because they really do hey men
[1:15:32] most church members have served God
[1:15:34] because they like all the blessings of
[1:15:36] God they don't they don't really like
[1:15:39] his character and what is this character
[1:15:40] what is it about you and I that love God
[1:15:43] about his character it's the fact that
[1:15:46] his character is true that is the one
[1:15:50] outstanding characteristics of God that
[1:15:52] makes us love what is it about God jesus
[1:15:55] said sanctify them through thy truth thy
[1:15:58] Word is truth they know what is it about
[1:16:02] God that we love the server because we
[1:16:04] know this is the truth of God we know
[1:16:09] God's sure he's not a man that he should
[1:16:10] lie every other man or church or
[1:16:13] denomination or woman will lie but God
[1:16:15] will not lie and that's ultimately why
[1:16:17] we love God because the Spirit of God is
[1:16:20] the Spirit of Truth how do you know
[1:16:24] praise God
[1:16:26] hey man I'm feeling good this morning
[1:16:28] praise God let me send my time for one
[1:16:31] thing about it now Birmingham corrects
[1:16:34] is later so brother kept saying I used
[1:16:37] to be a thorn see but now I'm a wheat
[1:16:39] see he corrects it later and he says you
[1:16:41] never were a pig turned into a sheep you
[1:16:44] always were she amen see brother he
[1:16:49] corrects that hold this carefully in
[1:16:52] mine now take the next step redeem means
[1:16:54] to buy back it restores to the original
[1:16:56] owner God by his death the shed blood
[1:16:59] back his own he bought back the spoken
[1:17:02] word seed brought my sheep hear my voice
[1:17:04] and they follow me
[1:17:06] you always were a sheep you never were a
[1:17:13] bigger dog turning the Sheep that is
[1:17:16] impossible for every kind of life
[1:17:19] produces the same kind and there's no
[1:17:22] change in your species yeah yeah don't
[1:17:28] get me wrong I've talked to people they
[1:17:30] say I never understood why God likens
[1:17:32] his people to cheaper it seems so
[1:17:33] strange because they said I've met some
[1:17:35] really ornery sheep well so have you
[1:17:39] in fact you used to be a pretty ornery
[1:17:42] sheep just ask your parents or ask your
[1:17:47] brothers and sisters ask your church
[1:17:49] friends before you got the Holy Ghost
[1:17:52] you're pretty ornery right there's some
[1:17:54] there's some sheep that are not so nice
[1:17:58] and so see that's how it is that's how
[1:18:00] it is with God before you realize you
[1:18:03] were sheep you might have acted like a
[1:18:05] goat but that didn't change the fact
[1:18:08] that deep down inside of you you were a
[1:18:10] sheep you just weren't acting like it
[1:18:13] and so it is today thank God finally
[1:18:16] acting like what you are amen so they
[1:18:21] gather this morning
[1:18:22] I can finally act like what I am a Holy
[1:18:24] Ghost no Christian who is born let's say
[1:18:27] more on the day of Pentecost I can find
[1:18:30] the act like that how do I know your
[1:18:32] praise God all those other years that
[1:18:34] act off staunch and religious prayers
[1:18:38] guard to the Creed and all these I
[1:18:39] believe the Trinity the Father Son and
[1:18:41] one three persons all this nonsense like
[1:18:43] that
[1:18:44] I can finally act like what I am a
[1:18:46] born-again son of God amen because he
[1:18:52] whom the Sun has set free is free indeed
[1:18:54] hallelujah can finally act like what I
[1:18:58] am thank the Lord
[1:19:01] well bro Graham says it's impossible for
[1:19:03] you to be a go and then be a sheep
[1:19:05] remember on the day of the judgment
[1:19:07] God's gonna separate the sheep from the
[1:19:09] goats because they always were goes
[1:19:13] because that was the seed inside of him
[1:19:15] as we were expressing the thoughts of
[1:19:18] God and then expressed in flesh there
[1:19:20] had to come a day when we would hear his
[1:19:22] voice the word and hearing that voice
[1:19:25] became aware of our Father calling us
[1:19:27] and recognized that we are the sons of
[1:19:29] God we heard his voice and we cried out
[1:19:31] as did the prodigal son save me Oh
[1:19:34] father I'm returning to thee so the
[1:19:38] story of redemption is plainly seen
[1:19:41] through the prodigal son is that right
[1:19:45] now what it just show three clips
[1:19:48] scriptures here and Haven kind of
[1:19:50] touched my heart yesterday so go to go
[1:19:52] to Luke 15 we're listening to an audio
[1:19:55] drama a Lamplighter audio German and
[1:19:57] they're telling a story of the great
[1:19:59] Shepherd and Haven said in the Banshees
[1:20:01] like Daddy is that in the Bible and my
[1:20:04] heart I felt so bad I'm like I haven't
[1:20:05] preached on that my daughter didn't know
[1:20:08] that was in the Bible remember in Haman
[1:20:09] did you say that or was a Karass it was
[1:20:11] you I thought that was so spiritual I
[1:20:13] thought well maybe she don't remember me
[1:20:16] preaching it but I'm gonna preach it
[1:20:17] again tomorrow so go to Luke 15 1 to 7
[1:20:24] so see the prodigal son was always a son
[1:20:28] but he was acting like a pig you say he
[1:20:31] was yes he was eating pig food just like
[1:20:34] used to eat pig food all those pig songs
[1:20:37] just listened to all those pig movies
[1:20:40] used to watch
[1:20:41] hello Church all that pig language used
[1:20:45] to talk your ongoing coins and your
[1:20:46] blankety-blank sand curse on this one
[1:20:48] curse on that one that was pig food but
[1:20:50] now you're feasting on eco food amen how
[1:20:54] do I know how I don't know how we live
[1:20:56] for that long on Pig food but we did
[1:21:00] that's right but now we have a different
[1:21:03] day praise God
[1:21:07] so Haven here you go Luke 15 verse 1
[1:21:10] then drew near and him all the
[1:21:12] Republicans and sinners 40 here and the
[1:21:14] Pharisees the scribes murmur saying this
[1:21:16] man receives sinners he eateth with them
[1:21:20] and he spake this
[1:21:21] every one of them saying what man of you
[1:21:23] having a hundred sheep if he lose one of
[1:21:25] them do not leave the ninety-nine in the
[1:21:27] wood earnest and go after that which is
[1:21:29] lost until he find it and when he found
[1:21:33] it he layeth on his shoulders rejoicing
[1:21:35] and when he come home he called together
[1:21:37] his friends and neighbors saying rejoice
[1:21:39] with me for I found my sheep which I
[1:21:42] which was lost I saying to you that
[1:21:44] likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
[1:21:47] sinner that repenteth more than over
[1:21:49] ninety and nine just persons which
[1:21:51] received repentance you see this type
[1:21:54] here the ninety-nine are tied to Israel
[1:21:59] the Gentile bride is this sheet that he
[1:22:02] throws on his shoulders because the
[1:22:04] Bible said the the Shepherd left them
[1:22:07] out in the learnis and if you turn your
[1:22:09] Bibles you don't have to but if you read
[1:22:11] revelation 12 that woman that was being
[1:22:14] chased by the dragon she was chased for
[1:22:16] three and a half years out into the
[1:22:18] wilderness that's the last half of
[1:22:21] Daniels 70th week
[1:22:22] that's the Tribulation Period so Jesus
[1:22:25] leaves the Jews to go just stay there
[1:22:28] for the the three to have your
[1:22:30] tribulation but he finds his little
[1:22:33] bride sheep there's one out of a hundred
[1:22:35] amen
[1:22:36] his special one his little lost sheep he
[1:22:39] goes up and binds that little nurse
[1:22:41] Wilson glory to God
[1:22:43] I've left the 99 that Jews rejected me
[1:22:46] but I'm bringing home the Gentile fraud
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:49] I'll bring it at home and she's on the
[1:22:51] strongest part of Christ on his
[1:22:53] shoulders amen we're the strongest place
[1:22:57] of Christ while his shoulders one is
[1:23:00] strength because their strength in his
[1:23:02] word amen hallelujah I notice he didn't
[1:23:06] go back to the word is with the Sheep
[1:23:08] he went home ha ha oh and we're going
[1:23:11] home to the murdered supper of the Lamb
[1:23:14] amen hallelujah he didn't take the Sheep
[1:23:19] back to the warners well the bride can
[1:23:21] go through tribulation to enjoy the
[1:23:22] tribulation he took us to heaven amen he
[1:23:26] packed us all the way to glory as an
[1:23:28] Angels let's rejoice the mayors of the
[1:23:31] lamb has come and the Sheep has made
[1:23:33] himself ready amen hallelujah
[1:23:37] there you go Haven the lost sheep was
[1:23:40] always a sheep I knew you you were one
[1:23:43] of God's little sheep dear he finds you
[1:23:47] put you on his shoulders and this sheeps
[1:23:51] gonna be safe this sheep is in good
[1:23:53] hands do you think all it all say has
[1:23:55] good hands Jesus Christ has better hands
[1:23:57] in all state you're in better hands with
[1:24:00] Jesus Christ you're in better hands with
[1:24:02] the nail-scarred hands not an area
[1:24:05] because those are tried and true that
[1:24:08] those hands have conquered death hell
[1:24:10] and the grave and have overcome amen
[1:24:13] all state never conquered even a tornado
[1:24:16] they clean up after the tornado I'll say
[1:24:18] don't come in and stop the tornado they
[1:24:20] come to salvage the damage but Jesus
[1:24:22] Christ defeated death the Bible said
[1:24:25] he's stoked on the Serpent's head and
[1:24:27] now death is nothing but a messenger to
[1:24:30] take you to the presence of God amen
[1:24:32] hallelujah now Herbert lives say last
[1:24:35] week somebody asked me on the overseas
[1:24:37] they asked me how could how could the
[1:24:40] Witch of Endor call up Samuel from
[1:24:43] paradise and I'd forgot to go look it up
[1:24:46] because members saw Saul went over said
[1:24:49] I can't hear from God I can't hear from
[1:24:51] the Urim Thummim
[1:24:52] I can't hear from a prophets I can't
[1:24:53] hear from Noah I'm cut off from God so
[1:24:55] his last resort was to go to a witch and
[1:24:58] he disguised himself and he said bring
[1:25:02] me up Samuel and she said promise me
[1:25:04] that you won't have me killed it I
[1:25:06] promise
[1:25:07] he said in the name of the Lord I
[1:25:09] promise to do something abominable then
[1:25:12] he protected her with the name of the
[1:25:14] Lord see how he how merciful God this
[1:25:16] church even in his most backslidden
[1:25:19] state God was still gonna save saw but
[1:25:23] saw by his own freemore agency got that
[1:25:26] hatred spirit on him
[1:25:27] got that murderous spirit I just want to
[1:25:29] kill him I just can't I hate him I can't
[1:25:32] stand him I'll chase him down I'll do
[1:25:33] whatever I can to kill him but God still
[1:25:35] save the man oh thank god there's hope
[1:25:38] for people today but if you know this
[1:25:43] Saul said just call him up and the Bible
[1:25:45] said the witch did her chapman's
[1:25:46] whatever and pretty soon she screamed
[1:25:48] she said I can't even scream my voice is
[1:25:50] all gone he said what do you see the Bob
[1:25:54] said he fell down to the ground what do
[1:25:56] you see
[1:25:56] she said I see God's coming up out of
[1:25:58] the earth god's little creators amen
[1:26:03] hallelujah samuel was a little creator
[1:26:06] amen
[1:26:07] you and i are little creators when we
[1:26:10] receive god's revelation and speak god
[1:26:13] revelation it creates something amen
[1:26:16] we've seen a lately create healing for
[1:26:19] people glory we've seen it creates a
[1:26:22] vation for people we've seen the world
[1:26:25] live create a different atmosphere in
[1:26:27] the church hopefully a different
[1:26:30] atmosphere in your home Amen I don't
[1:26:33] know yeah cuz your little gags your
[1:26:35] little creators who take what's been
[1:26:37] revealed and you speak God's Word and
[1:26:39] then it happens
[1:26:41] amen she said I see God's coming up out
[1:26:45] of the earth and then Samuel starts
[1:26:46] talking but man said the reason she
[1:26:49] could do that the reason that she had a
[1:26:52] power to access souls in the heart of
[1:26:55] the earth is because they were not in
[1:26:57] heaven they were in the middle of the
[1:26:59] earth and they were not in God's
[1:27:02] presence and we sang about where are you
[1:27:05] safe in God's presence
[1:27:07] so before the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:27:10] sorcerers could go down and contact you
[1:27:13] people's souls
[1:27:14] bring them up because they weren't
[1:27:16] protected by the Holy Spirit but now
[1:27:18] through the blood of Jesus Christ it's
[1:27:21] all changed they had the blood of Jesus
[1:27:24] Christ has traded a forcefield has
[1:27:27] treated protection is creative strength
[1:27:30] time so no demon or no demon power can
[1:27:33] access the soul that's gone beyond the
[1:27:36] current of time because the blood of
[1:27:38] Jesus Christ the Spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:27:40] now protects them amen hallelujah
[1:27:44] and now those Souls go to that sixth
[1:27:47] dimension where there's God's holy
[1:27:49] presence and the demons try to get in
[1:27:52] there how can we access our can we
[1:27:54] access Paul
[1:27:56] can we access and the Holy Spirit shuts
[1:27:57] them down I said you're not bothering
[1:27:59] them you're not touching them they're
[1:28:01] protected by the blood oh I'm so
[1:28:06] thankful to be under the blood church
[1:28:11] hallelujah
[1:28:12] Galatians 4:6 I'm sorry I get it I was
[1:28:16] gonna say pull that up don't you
[1:28:20] appreciate the Word of God oh my the
[1:28:23] Bible has all the answers we just gotta
[1:28:24] wait on it praise the Lord
[1:28:27] Galatians 4:6 so see the blood of Jesus
[1:28:31] Christ had not been shed so that demon
[1:28:33] power could bring up Souls but now that
[1:28:35] the blood has been shed it's forgiven
[1:28:37] them they've all left the heart of the
[1:28:39] earth and now they're in God's presence
[1:28:41] that is thrown in that sixth dimension
[1:28:43] praise God
[1:28:44] so Satan can't touch him anymore
[1:28:47] hallelujah he's lost his power he's been
[1:28:51] stripped of all his rights amen because
[1:28:54] jesus paid the price Jesus bought him
[1:28:57] with his own blood he paid the ransom he
[1:28:59] paid off the debt he that's what we all
[1:29:01] want right we all want to see our debts
[1:29:03] paid off well Jesus Christ at Burnett he
[1:29:05] paid our sin-debt soph amen
[1:29:09] well the RAM cause Galatians 4:6 is the
[1:29:13] triumphal capstone of the baptism of the
[1:29:17] Holy Ghost this is the capstone that
[1:29:20] that caps it all off so in order to
[1:29:23] finish the teaching on the baptism of
[1:29:26] the Holy Ghost this is the capstone that
[1:29:28] must come down upon your thinking as
[1:29:32] I've been preaching and read and praying
[1:29:34] and serving God all these years I've
[1:29:36] seen that capstone come down upon my
[1:29:38] life idea and it's capped off my life
[1:29:42] hallelujah it's capped off my soul and
[1:29:45] now I know why I could be born again
[1:29:48] it's because I already was a son I just
[1:29:51] didn't realize it
[1:29:55] because your sons God has sent forth the
[1:29:58] spirit of God into your hearts crying
[1:30:00] Abba Father so because you are a son you
[1:30:07] could receive the Holy Spirit this is
[1:30:11] the capstone because you were for know
[1:30:13] because God knew you'd want it amen
[1:30:16] because God knew you want to be sealed
[1:30:18] with the love of God and not the love of
[1:30:21] the world because you a son or daughter
[1:30:23] God sent his spirit into your soul Amen
[1:30:27] hallelujah
[1:30:29] and that's the capstone that caps it off
[1:30:32] in other words I was the son of God haha
[1:30:35] is yours where daughter of God and so II
[1:30:39] this had to happen the thing you desire
[1:30:42] the thing you want all these years it
[1:30:44] had to happen because you always wanna
[1:30:47] shape of God amen
[1:30:48] you A's were a son or daughter of God it
[1:30:53] was just a matter of time I think this
[1:30:57] is what bothers us a lot right waiting
[1:30:59] on the time when is this gonna happen
[1:31:02] when is this gonna happen
[1:31:04] God's clock is ticking right on time
[1:31:06] sometimes we're like God can you check
[1:31:08] and see if your batteries ran out on
[1:31:10] your clock up there I prayed for this 10
[1:31:12] years ago where's it at now his
[1:31:16] batteries don't run they're their
[1:31:18] eternal batteries they don't run out of
[1:31:22] charge like I got to keep these under
[1:31:26] here in case I just put him in a bag his
[1:31:28] other bag rip I got these batteries in
[1:31:30] here I got these batteries you know
[1:31:33] these God's not like oh oh the rapture
[1:31:36] is like oh let me put this back in let
[1:31:39] me put these batteries in let me take
[1:31:40] out the old ones God put them in there
[1:31:42] before the foundation world and they're
[1:31:44] clicking right on time and we must not
[1:31:47] be discouraged we must trust that God
[1:31:48] has a time and season for everything
[1:31:52] all those Saints had to have died shed
[1:31:55] their blood and suffer persecution and
[1:31:57] we've just got the only thing we've got
[1:31:59] two battles the lust of the flesh and
[1:32:00] riches and and a life they had to there
[1:32:06] to battle being taken to the stake there
[1:32:09] is being burned down we've got a battle
[1:32:11] spending too much time on our phone or
[1:32:14] giving our money to things of the world
[1:32:16] that we shouldn't give our money to or
[1:32:19] spread or just choosing the wrong person
[1:32:21] to spend time with or live our lives or
[1:32:23] there's somebody that we have such a
[1:32:25] different we say a more easy battle
[1:32:27] physically spiritually it's the greatest
[1:32:30] battle ever fought because it's the
[1:32:32] greatest Age of deception but that's why
[1:32:35] God looks at the Church of Laodicea and
[1:32:37] it makes him throw up not the bride the
[1:32:39] church because they say they're rich and
[1:32:41] increased with Goods they say we've got
[1:32:43] the Holy Ghost these they say we go this
[1:32:45] money and they don't want any more of
[1:32:47] God I hope there's somebody here that
[1:32:49] wants more of God they might is this
[1:32:52] that if you are content with how much
[1:32:54] God you have you're officially Laodicean
[1:32:57] lukewarm because there are the ones who
[1:33:00] said I don't have no more need of God
[1:33:02] look at look at look at all that I've
[1:33:03] done I don't have to have to do anything
[1:33:05] more I've got enough of God I don't need
[1:33:07] anymore
[1:33:07] that's a Laodicean spirit you better
[1:33:10] pray to that gets cast off you exactly I
[1:33:13] gotta cast off about every day don't you
[1:33:16] church every day you gotta cast down
[1:33:19] anything that results itself against the
[1:33:21] knowledge of God now here's where we
[1:33:24] gotta understand this is the one thing
[1:33:26] that's you know it's stuck in my mind
[1:33:27] jesus said you've not chosen me but I've
[1:33:30] chosen you and ordained you that you
[1:33:32] should go forth and bring forth fruit
[1:33:33] and that your fruit should remain that
[1:33:35] whatsoever you shall ask of the Father
[1:33:37] in my name he may give it to you to see
[1:33:40] I believe church this is referring to
[1:33:43] Jesus choosing their specific ministries
[1:33:46] and their age in history because again
[1:33:50] Jesus can't jesus can't force them to
[1:33:52] serve him and say okay now you overcome
[1:33:54] your the overcomer he forced if he did
[1:33:57] that he forced them to do it are with me
[1:34:00] church they can't force you
[1:34:06] God can't force you like mother and said
[1:34:07] God can't put you all the way through
[1:34:09] the piping so you did it congratulations
[1:34:11] you did an awesome job you'd be like
[1:34:14] well you pushed me through you forced me
[1:34:15] to do it so you must understand this in
[1:34:19] light of foreknowledge Jesus's said I'm
[1:34:22] choosing you
[1:34:23] this time in season the Bible said Jesus
[1:34:25] called 12 and he chose them and called
[1:34:28] them up to a mountain are you with me
[1:34:30] that's what this is speaking of Jesus
[1:34:33] chose them in time but God in His
[1:34:35] foreknowledge already knew that they
[1:34:38] would love him amen I know yeah that's
[1:34:41] right Church you can't make one
[1:34:44] contradict the other either God looked
[1:34:47] at our choice our free moral agency
[1:34:50] choice either God looked at that or God
[1:34:52] said I'm forcing bang to serve me he has
[1:34:54] no choice in the matter
[1:34:57] well now that's not free more agency
[1:34:59] anymore now it's God's agency choosing
[1:35:03] you enforcing you're gonna do something
[1:35:05] does everyone understand so this refers
[1:35:08] to the time they lived and I chose you I
[1:35:11] called you in this time but it's based
[1:35:14] upon what I saw you choose in my mind
[1:35:16] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:18] that's right Church that's the only way
[1:35:21] we can understand it because remember
[1:35:23] the Bible said this is the day of
[1:35:24] Pentecost now I'm going to skip down
[1:35:26] because of time I want to try to finish
[1:35:28] here
[1:35:31] Jesus was delivered by the determinate
[1:35:34] counsel and foreknowledge of God so God
[1:35:37] chose when Jesus would be delivered to
[1:35:40] the Romans and the Jews and they would
[1:35:41] crucify him at the ragazze that time
[1:35:45] Kasim Emer purpose the determinate
[1:35:48] counsel or purpose of God God
[1:35:50] predestinated the time Jesus will be
[1:35:52] crucified I love this Jesus that he
[1:35:56] tells us John and James's mother he says
[1:36:00] you shall need drink a mic and D drink
[1:36:03] of my cup and be baptized with the
[1:36:04] baptism I'm baptized with glory the Holy
[1:36:06] Ghost but to sit on my right hand on my
[1:36:09] left is not mine to give but it shall be
[1:36:12] given to them for whom it was prepared
[1:36:14] of my father see even Jesus can't
[1:36:20] guarantees Ebony's wife he can't
[1:36:23] guarantee that James and John will sit
[1:36:25] on the right hand because he said that's
[1:36:27] up to the Eternal Spirit that's up to
[1:36:30] the Father what he has prepared or what
[1:36:32] he's predestinated in his plan
[1:36:36] see even Jesus flesh didn't know all the
[1:36:38] plans of God in his flesh now that's
[1:36:40] where we look at tonight Jesus flesh and
[1:36:42] revelation I love this right before the
[1:36:50] day of Pentecost they said Lord will you
[1:36:52] at this time restore the kingdom of
[1:36:53] Israel and he said is not for you to
[1:36:55] know the times or the seasons which the
[1:36:57] father hath put us in his own power to
[1:37:02] see after for knowing our choices he
[1:37:04] determines the times and seasons of our
[1:37:06] manifestation hallelujah so here's the
[1:37:12] order of your manifestation if you want
[1:37:13] to see the church Jesus went from
[1:37:16] thought to theophany Melchizedek - flesh
[1:37:20] body on the earth and now he's in a
[1:37:22] glorified body but RAM said we're
[1:37:25] different we went from thought he said
[1:37:27] we bypassed our theophany we went from
[1:37:30] the thought of God to flesh body after
[1:37:33] we die though we going off the Alpha
[1:37:36] knee unless the rapture comes because
[1:37:38] then if the rapture comes that fee alpha
[1:37:40] knee come down and our flesh body be
[1:37:43] swung up in the glorified body and the
[1:37:45] glorified body will meet the theophany
[1:37:46] because the Bible said the theophany is
[1:37:48] before the throne of God in heaven amen
[1:37:51] other data that's right that's why I
[1:37:57] feel that's why you feel connected to
[1:37:58] your body that's why you know you take
[1:38:00] care of your body because one day God's
[1:38:02] gonna make this body brand new praise
[1:38:04] God there's a few pieces of bull missing
[1:38:07] from the shoulder but guess what they're
[1:38:08] not gone God's gonna get back to me I
[1:38:11] there's a few hairs missing from this
[1:38:14] head but believes that God is gonna
[1:38:15] bring every single one right back to us
[1:38:18] amen
[1:38:19] wherever they live beforehand that's
[1:38:21] where they're waiting for me right now
[1:38:22] but God's gonna bring them all back amen
[1:38:26] because it's part of his perfect
[1:38:27] creation and God redeems everything that
[1:38:31] is lost
[1:38:33] so if we
[1:38:35] I will go to through our theophany this
[1:38:36] flush body will drop will go to our
[1:38:39] theophany at the rapture all that
[1:38:40] theophany will come down and the the
[1:38:42] Holy Spirit will rise up that that flesh
[1:38:45] body change it to glorified and we'll
[1:38:47] meet in the air at the rapture
[1:38:51] hallelujah now says the bride was
[1:38:56] already this mind yes she was she was
[1:38:57] existing in his thoughts and what about
[1:38:59] those thoughts of God the eternal are
[1:39:01] they not so where are you before you're
[1:39:04] in this body you were actually in the
[1:39:06] mind of God he's omniscient he never had
[1:39:12] a new thought about anything because all
[1:39:13] his thoughts always had and always will
[1:39:15] have he knows him from the beginning
[1:39:16] thus the thoughts have got our eternal
[1:39:18] they're real so there's a part of you
[1:39:21] that is an eternal thought of God and
[1:39:24] that's your soul Amen this flesh it is
[1:39:29] that eternal your human mind up and down
[1:39:32] tired right got thoughts bad thoughts
[1:39:34] that's not eternal but that's so that
[1:39:37] life that point of view that's quickened
[1:39:40] by the Spirit of God that's eternal and
[1:39:42] that came from the mind of God Oh
[1:39:46] hallelujah
[1:39:49] they're not just like a man with a
[1:39:51] blueprint that job up in one day be
[1:39:53] translating to real substance they
[1:39:55] already are real and they're eternal and
[1:40:00] a part of God we can't catch you yet can
[1:40:04] we church one day we'll catch it
[1:40:06] one day I'll catch it one day you'll get
[1:40:08] you and I think the rapture is gonna
[1:40:10] take place after that
[1:40:11] but notice Bible said it is not the
[1:40:14] person that comes free destinated from
[1:40:16] God it's the word or seed so see this
[1:40:20] proves there was no pre-existence of
[1:40:23] souls you and I were not singing in
[1:40:25] heaven you know before we come down to
[1:40:28] earth because it's not the person that
[1:40:31] comes from God it's the thought that
[1:40:32] comes from God now I know there's a
[1:40:37] Motum says we were the sons of God
[1:40:39] shouting for joy I believe that was
[1:40:42] actually angels and I sure that was then
[1:40:43] couple years ago we're talking about
[1:40:44] that because the Bible said when Satan
[1:40:47] presented himself before the Lord all
[1:40:48] the sons of God came to present
[1:40:49] themselves as well so I believe that had
[1:40:52] to be angels
[1:40:53] I know angels are not called sons but it
[1:40:55] seems like the King James translators
[1:40:56] may be mistranslated that something like
[1:40:59] that but you get the same idea you get
[1:41:01] the same idea Satan was a fallen angel
[1:41:03] of God and he had to come present
[1:41:05] himself before the Lord and the Lord
[1:41:07] asked him where you were so he must've
[1:41:09] been asking all those angels where they
[1:41:10] weren't what were they doing were they
[1:41:12] been up to
[1:41:13] but brother have says you are not a
[1:41:15] person pre-existing before you came here
[1:41:20] you were in the mind of God see it was
[1:41:26] the thought and then that thought became
[1:41:27] expressed and God bought back Jacob
[1:41:30] because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone
[1:41:33] had this seed that is why he had
[1:41:35] respected the birthright in the coming
[1:41:36] of God I love this if you are a true
[1:41:39] seed you will hear that word I'm talking
[1:41:44] about this word well preaching that we
[1:41:45] call the message of God if you are seed
[1:41:49] you receive the Word of God the Spirit
[1:41:53] will baptize you in the body of Christ
[1:41:55] filling you with empowering you and
[1:41:56] you'll receive the word for your day and
[1:41:58] age see how clear the trevin's becomes
[1:42:00] when the revealed word is revealed in
[1:42:02] you ha ha ha oh it's so clear what is
[1:42:06] the heavens evidence the Holy Ghost it's
[1:42:08] someone who can receive and live the
[1:42:11] Word of God for your day that's the
[1:42:14] evidence it's always been the evidence
[1:42:16] whoever manifested God's message for
[1:42:19] that hour that was the evidence that
[1:42:21] they had the Holy Ghost advanced
[1:42:26] remember your eyes or statue your eyes
[1:42:28] your statue
[1:42:30] whatever you were you were just thinking
[1:42:32] at the beginning the only thing that you
[1:42:34] are is the expression of the word and
[1:42:35] after he thought he spoke it and hurt
[1:42:37] here you are so he had to speak so when
[1:42:44] I was born in that cold November day in
[1:42:46] 1980 my mom didn't hear my dad didn't
[1:42:49] hear it but Jesus spoke instead
[1:42:51] let Jesse Smith receive the breath of
[1:42:53] life and the spoken word of God let him
[1:42:57] be born on November 17 1980 I think was
[1:43:00] 12:10 p.m. let him bring forth I'm
[1:43:03] expressing his name then pretty soon put
[1:43:11] him on the nurse get him nursing
[1:43:12] God it had to express but you and I
[1:43:16] didn't I didn't know that I didn't even
[1:43:18] know I was a child of God at that time
[1:43:19] oh I didn't know anything but now I can
[1:43:23] look back and see that was when God one
[1:43:25] to express my my person my manifestation
[1:43:28] my seed his thought I wouldn't Express
[1:43:31] Jesse Smith in this by the thought of
[1:43:33] him in this day and age and so that's
[1:43:36] when I came forth same things true for
[1:43:38] you church you're just an expression of
[1:43:42] the word to see your thought then you
[1:43:47] came flesh body
[1:43:48] you weren't existing and worshiping in
[1:43:50] heaven you know praising the Lord having
[1:43:52] a good time in heaven you were a thought
[1:43:54] then you came to flesh see your name was
[1:43:59] ordained of God and place on the book of
[1:44:00] life before the foundation work you were
[1:44:02] there and as that's roots you don't
[1:44:03] remember it no because you're just a
[1:44:06] part of his life you're part of God when
[1:44:10] you become a son or daughter of God just
[1:44:12] as you're part of your earthly father
[1:44:13] who remembers being your dad
[1:44:15] they don't any on any of you before
[1:44:16] you're born you remember being in your
[1:44:18] dad no well Graham said that's the same
[1:44:21] way it is with God you don't remember it
[1:44:24] because you can't remember it you
[1:44:26] weren't expressed yet but you were a
[1:44:28] seed waiting to be expressed the male
[1:44:32] carries the hemoglobin the blood and
[1:44:33] when the when that has gone the egg then
[1:44:35] you become a part of your father
[1:44:36] and your mother's a part of your father
[1:44:38] also so you're all part of your father
[1:44:40] now we see the attributes sons of a
[1:44:43] spirit have not yet entered in the word
[1:44:45] form body but a theophany this body is
[1:44:49] subject to the word and earnest waiting
[1:44:51] for the earnest change of the body so
[1:44:53] listen let me go back to that thought of
[1:44:55] job if you believe you were in heaven
[1:44:59] shouting when the world was founded what
[1:45:01] body were you in
[1:45:04] there's only three bodies but the man
[1:45:06] says you did not enter into the
[1:45:08] theophany yet let takes it down to two
[1:45:10] you were not in your flesh body yet
[1:45:13] because that wasn't here oh that was
[1:45:15] part of the dust of the earth and that
[1:45:17] only leaves your glorified body but a
[1:45:19] glorified body is only a brand-new
[1:45:21] version an eternal version of your flesh
[1:45:23] body because those who are tied together
[1:45:24] so that takes away all of them that
[1:45:28] means it wasn't you that means it was
[1:45:30] the Angels shouting at the foundation of
[1:45:33] world because you've not yet entered
[1:45:35] into theophany but now that your honor
[1:45:37] you've heard from your theophany have
[1:45:41] you heard
[1:45:42] I've got internal body somewhere I want
[1:45:45] to live in a perfect body the Bible
[1:45:47] calls it your eternal hole in the
[1:45:50] heavens amen I've heard from my other
[1:45:54] home when this body drops my soul will
[1:45:57] go to that other home the other temple
[1:45:59] that's the Alpha knee brother man says
[1:46:02] I've never entered that's theophany yet
[1:46:05] doesn't corner Bertram's teaching you
[1:46:08] can't place sons and daughters of God
[1:46:10] there's theophany saying shouting the
[1:46:12] earth is being formed you can't do that
[1:46:14] because you haven't even entered into
[1:46:15] that theophany yet but you can believe
[1:46:19] whatever you want it's not it's not a
[1:46:20] doctrine to divide us I'm just trying to
[1:46:22] show you the truth of the word of God
[1:46:25] Rahab said later we learned we never
[1:46:28] heard no more about Kelsey because he
[1:46:29] became Jesus Christ
[1:46:30] Melchizedek was the priest that became
[1:46:32] Jesus Christ and now you are bypassed
[1:46:34] that because in that form he knows all
[1:46:36] things and you never have been able to
[1:46:38] know that yet you come like Adam like me
[1:46:40] you came from the attribute to the flesh
[1:46:43] and the church said to be tempted why
[1:46:47] did he do this so you could be tempted
[1:46:49] but man says if you were to went through
[1:46:51] your theophany first you were to
[1:46:52] remembered it and then you would have
[1:46:54] been easier able to overcome all the
[1:46:57] temptations the world because you
[1:46:58] already knew about it oh I know when I'm
[1:47:00] 18 I'm at the bat off that demon spirit
[1:47:03] of lust when I'm 15 I enough to battle
[1:47:05] off that hatred spirit you would know
[1:47:07] her everything about it because you
[1:47:09] already had the perfect foreknowledge of
[1:47:10] that body but brother have said God made
[1:47:13] you bypass that so you could stand as a
[1:47:15] free more agent amen
[1:47:18] you could stand there in the middle of
[1:47:19] fight with the full armor of God on and
[1:47:21] you don't know what's coming next
[1:47:23] all's you know is you're ready to fight
[1:47:25] the devil a man but if you're in under
[1:47:29] your throughout free you wouldn't look
[1:47:30] like almost go to sleep but just cut off
[1:47:31] all the enemies we'll just my god you
[1:47:36] see y'all then you would have known
[1:47:37] everything but now you gonna stand on
[1:47:40] guard you can't get lazy and you gotta
[1:47:42] look for Saint behind every corner you
[1:47:45] got to make sure you don't sneak into
[1:47:47] your life somehow you got to be ready to
[1:47:49] lunch at your post of duty Jesus said if
[1:47:52] you want to go the rapture you better
[1:47:53] watch and pray man we can't be lazy as
[1:47:57] Christians because we never entered into
[1:48:00] our theophany we don't know what's gonna
[1:48:01] come in 2019 we don't know the trials
[1:48:03] who would have thought in 2018 we would
[1:48:05] have lost all these people from the
[1:48:06] message who would have predicted that
[1:48:09] not me imagine being me I've had people
[1:48:15] that left the message tell me it the
[1:48:17] very reason they left was because of me
[1:48:19] because of what I preached and I'd be
[1:48:22] the guy make a decision am I gonna
[1:48:23] compromise and say I'm sorry you know I
[1:48:26] would you come back to the church I
[1:48:29] gotta say well that's your choice but
[1:48:33] I'm standing on the state the Lord I've
[1:48:36] chosen the latter just so you know I
[1:48:39] haven't begged anybody to come back here
[1:48:41] I don't want to beg anybody here because
[1:48:43] I know father he'll draw people here
[1:48:46] they'll draw whoever supposed to be here
[1:48:49] it's part of his plan it's predestinated
[1:48:51] he'll make sure they're here amen
[1:48:54] hallelujah I've got a bag and proselyte
[1:48:57] and denominator or anything like that
[1:48:59] all that the father's give me in Akron
[1:49:01] will come to me in Akron that's what he
[1:49:03] promised see clear
[1:49:09] makes it clear you will never be the way
[1:49:10] unless you as a thought at the beginning
[1:49:12] that proves the predestination of God
[1:49:15] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:49:17] thought you had to be in the thinking
[1:49:20] first see but in order to stem
[1:49:22] temptation you had to bypass the
[1:49:24] theophany you had to come down here in
[1:49:26] flesh to be tempted by sin and then if
[1:49:28] you stand all of that the father's give
[1:49:31] me will come to me and I'll raise them
[1:49:32] but the last days let me close to this
[1:49:35] here I'm going to go real fast how many
[1:49:38] understand the power of free moorings do
[1:49:40] you understand how powerful your choices
[1:49:42] you can make today are they're so
[1:49:44] powerful they may impact eternity that's
[1:49:48] right the choices you make today in your
[1:49:50] life in the next weeks and months and
[1:49:52] years the choices you make will impact
[1:49:54] your eternity remember Joshua told them
[1:50:01] he already got most of the inhabitants
[1:50:03] kicked out and he said choose you this
[1:50:04] day whom you will serve
[1:50:05] make a choice it's your free more agency
[1:50:08] you want to be victorious or doing a
[1:50:10] compromise with idols
[1:50:12] you know Jesus was called a manual a
[1:50:15] virgin shall conceive he'll be manual
[1:50:17] butter and honey shall you eat that he
[1:50:19] may know how to refuse the evil and
[1:50:21] choose the good Oh hallelujah
[1:50:23] so Jesus his diet brother amen would
[1:50:27] help him to choose the right thing ha ha
[1:50:29] ha because he was choosing the spiritual
[1:50:32] butter and the spiritual honey of God's
[1:50:34] Word
[1:50:35] because of that he refused evil and he
[1:50:38] chose good same thing for you if you eat
[1:50:42] the the butter and the honey you'll
[1:50:43] choose the right thing to do that's what
[1:50:48] the Bible says about Emanuel virgin
[1:50:50] shall conceive he's gonna choose good
[1:50:52] because of what he eats I'm glad I'm
[1:50:55] feasting on the Word of God today and
[1:50:56] not some denomination or some live from
[1:50:59] the pit of hell like three persons look
[1:51:02] at this God promised even the eunuchs
[1:51:04] now saith the Lord on the eunuchs that
[1:51:06] keep my Sabbath and choose the things
[1:51:08] that please me and take hold of my
[1:51:09] covenant even unto them when I give in
[1:51:11] my house and within my walls a place and
[1:51:13] a name better than the sons and of the
[1:51:15] daughters I will give them an
[1:51:17] everlasting name that shall not be cut
[1:51:20] off
[1:51:23] all based upon what your choice whatever
[1:51:26] you choose based upon your choosing will
[1:51:29] be your reward remember the Bible says
[1:51:34] be not deceived God is not mocked you'll
[1:51:36] reap whatever you sow whoever you
[1:51:40] whoever you serve whatever you do is
[1:51:42] based upon who you yield to I let God
[1:51:44] have his way or I let sin have its way
[1:51:46] we have to yield to the Holy Spirit
[1:51:50] jesus said those in Sardis will be
[1:51:53] worthy because they've not defiled they
[1:51:55] chose not to defile themselves in sinful
[1:51:58] garments so Jesus says you're worthy
[1:52:01] that's how Jesus can say you're worthy
[1:52:04] is because you chose it you had right
[1:52:07] and wrong before you and you chose I'm
[1:52:10] choosing the right and so Jesus says
[1:52:12] you're worthy let's turn our feet let me
[1:52:17] close with this I posted this on I think
[1:52:20] Facebook this is this morning at five
[1:52:22] fifty five fifty one a.m. I think it was
[1:52:24] I love getting up early church I love it
[1:52:28] I said quiet time with Jesus it's you
[1:52:31] can't beat it I love getting up and
[1:52:36] staying the word and meditating upon the
[1:52:38] word when brother and preach marriage
[1:52:42] and divorce he was wearing cufflinks or
[1:52:44] what they call cufflinks like these but
[1:52:46] they're not cufflinks these are just
[1:52:47] buttons but he had cufflinks on his and
[1:52:49] they had over they're white and they had
[1:52:51] a red stripe down the middle he said it
[1:52:53] reminded him of the blood of Jesus
[1:52:54] Christ and he got him from Danny Henry
[1:52:56] which two years previously after brother
[1:52:58] ham preached a sermon came up and laid
[1:53:02] his hands on him and said brother brand
[1:53:04] not to be sacrilegious but that sermon
[1:53:06] could have been the 23rd chapter of
[1:53:08] Revelation which brother man said that's
[1:53:11] quite a compliment and the boy know
[1:53:15] nothing about it his arms around me and
[1:53:18] started speaking in an unknown language
[1:53:20] for people that spoke French come up and
[1:53:23] interpret it and they all interpreted
[1:53:25] the same romance and write it down right
[1:53:27] even down the punctuation make sure all
[1:53:29] four said the same thing and brother
[1:53:32] Graham said I want to read it to you how
[1:53:34] many want to read it today
[1:53:36] what the holy spirit said it was a
[1:53:38] prophecy to brother Branham what is God
[1:53:42] rewarding him for God's rewarding him
[1:53:45] for his choices and listen Church God's
[1:53:48] gonna reward you and I based upon our
[1:53:51] choices are free more agency I think
[1:53:56] sometimes we forget how important is
[1:53:58] just to make the right choice the Holy
[1:54:02] Spirit said by foot people with the
[1:54:04] state the Lord because thou has chosen
[1:54:07] the narrow path are you choosing the
[1:54:09] easier path or the harder path we want
[1:54:12] to choose the way of God which is always
[1:54:14] the harder path it's always harder to
[1:54:16] follow God's will the harder way thou
[1:54:20] hast walked in your own choosing God
[1:54:22] didn't force brother Branham to do this
[1:54:25] God didn't force David to slay Goliath
[1:54:27] he led him to do it but he didn't force
[1:54:29] him he had to make that choice
[1:54:31] thou has picked the correct and precise
[1:54:34] decision he said and it is my way
[1:54:39] because of this momentous decision a
[1:54:42] huge portion of heaven will await thee
[1:54:48] for the glorious decision thou hast made
[1:54:54] this I love this because this this is
[1:54:57] where you and I come in right here
[1:54:58] hahaha
[1:54:59] this in itself is that which will give
[1:55:02] and make to come to pass the tremendous
[1:55:05] victory in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:09] you see it what is the baptism of the
[1:55:12] Holy Ghost
[1:55:12] it is God's love God's Spirit down in
[1:55:15] your soul and because brother Ram chose
[1:55:19] to preached the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:55:20] without compromise it would bring a
[1:55:22] great victory in the life of every bride
[1:55:24] member oh thank you Lord Jesus because
[1:55:31] you chose I didn't force you I gave you
[1:55:34] the choice you make the decision I'm
[1:55:36] giving you the tree of life or the tree
[1:55:38] of knowledge good evil you make the
[1:55:40] choice God didn't force brother Ram
[1:55:43] you've got to do this but I said like
[1:55:45] this God taught brother Ram you better
[1:55:46] obey the Word of God like in South
[1:55:48] Africa I forgot that it went there and
[1:55:50] got there
[1:55:50] phoebus God taught him a pretty good
[1:55:52] lesson how many know God has taught you
[1:55:55] some pretty good lessons through the
[1:55:57] things which you've suffered I think he
[1:56:02] I think it was out preaching for a whole
[1:56:03] year he was out with amoebas in his
[1:56:05] stomach
[1:56:06] God reminding him God teaching him don't
[1:56:10] bow to organisations don't give in to
[1:56:14] creeds and and politics among preachers
[1:56:18] just lead or follow the leadership of
[1:56:21] the Holy Ghost and you know think about
[1:56:23] that every day in pain for a whole year
[1:56:28] but jesus said the reward will be great
[1:56:31] if you choose the harder way it was a
[1:56:37] prophecy it was prophesying foretelling
[1:56:40] that a huge portion of heaven await and
[1:56:42] I remember remember I read this a few
[1:56:45] weeks ago well I shouldn't say weeks
[1:56:50] months here's what brother Branham
[1:56:54] called his ministry I'm so thankful that
[1:56:56] we just past Thanksgiving that God
[1:56:58] Almighty if it be that way has let me do
[1:57:01] a little something in my uneducated
[1:57:03] condition to show my appreciation for of
[1:57:07] his love to me my love to him and to our
[1:57:12] love to the people what does this all go
[1:57:14] back to love remember I showed you the
[1:57:18] Cobra Ram said God thought back who's
[1:57:20] gonna love me in 6,000 years and they
[1:57:23] oughta see ya and he saw you raise your
[1:57:25] hand at one meeting someday or you
[1:57:28] coming I remember a man coming to the
[1:57:29] altar and crying at the I remember that
[1:57:31] day oh honey yeah I remember that day
[1:57:36] for me crying with my hands up saying
[1:57:38] thank you forgive me Lord I want to be a
[1:57:39] Christian I remember that day God force
[1:57:42] on said oh yeah he'll love me she'll
[1:57:45] choose me and then God leads us and
[1:57:49] guides us and at the end of the road
[1:57:50] we'll say thank you Lord that I could
[1:57:54] show my love to you with the ministry
[1:57:56] you gave me hummer thankful for God's
[1:57:59] ministry that he gave you
[1:58:01] how many one be faithful of that
[1:58:02] ministry if you are read this back in
[1:58:06] August at the YMCA the first one comes
[1:58:11] in Jesus and look you gave me a pound
[1:58:13] I've gained ten I've become ten times
[1:58:16] the preacher I was at the beginning oh
[1:58:18] god I hope I can say that on that day
[1:58:20] and he said well thou good and faithful
[1:58:23] servant because thou has been faithful
[1:58:26] in a very little you have authority over
[1:58:29] ten cities how many believe that that
[1:58:35] prophecy was right about brother Branham
[1:58:37] a huge portion of heaven awaits you
[1:58:40] because you left your family you left
[1:58:42] your wife
[1:58:43] you left bram Tabernacle the easy life
[1:58:45] you left all that and the Bible said it
[1:58:49] with just a little thing he gives you
[1:58:51] authority over 10 cities and a little
[1:58:52] thing how much more for great things in
[1:58:59] the other parallel passage of the
[1:59:03] parable of talents he says well done
[1:59:04] good and faithful servant
[1:59:05] now spend faithful over a few things
[1:59:06] I'll make thee ruler over many things
[1:59:09] enter thou into the joy of the Lord many
[1:59:15] things huge portions that kind of say
[1:59:18] like that church huge portions of reward
[1:59:21] can await us if we just do what God
[1:59:24] tells us to do if we can just be
[1:59:27] faithful with the things God has placed
[1:59:29] into our hands and like we said it could
[1:59:30] be children it could be a singing gift
[1:59:32] it could be a preaching gift it could be
[1:59:35] a prophesying gift or speaking in
[1:59:36] tongues gift or get the wisdom and
[1:59:38] knowledge if we can just be faithful
[1:59:40] with that God reward us abundantly
[1:59:44] because we chose the harder way the
[1:59:51] Bible says
[1:59:52] overcometh it and keeps my works to the
[1:59:54] end for me it'd be well I'll just quit
[1:59:58] the church or maybe I'll just give up
[2:00:00] pastor but the Bible says if I can keep
[2:00:03] the works to the end the Bible said to
[2:00:05] him when I give power over the nation's
[2:00:07] and not only that he said and I'll give
[2:00:09] you they shall rule with the rod of iron
[2:00:12] he gives them a scepter to rule over
[2:00:15] those cities and nations that he talked
[2:00:17] about if we can let the authority of God
[2:00:22] if we can choose to let the authority of
[2:00:25] God rule our lives now Jesus said I got
[2:00:28] a rod of iron waiting for you in the
[2:00:30] Millenium how many love the Lord praise
[2:00:37] I believe that's it yeah I believe
[2:00:38] that's it by God's grace well perfect
[2:00:39] timing it's one o'clock you love the
[2:00:42] Lord oh thank you Jesus
[2:00:45] how many appreciate predestination he
[2:00:47] lets you in a foreknowledge it's become
[2:00:50] it's become more clear to me on the back
[2:00:54] of God's mind is that for knowledge
[2:00:56] based upon free more agency okay come to
[2:00:59] the end of there and now that's why
[2:01:02] church this is transform my life that's
[2:01:04] why I'm trying to get up earlier trying
[2:01:06] to be more faithful trying to study or
[2:01:07] more all the time
[2:01:08] pray more is because I know there's a
[2:01:12] reward when I make the right choice
[2:01:14] I can't wait for God to just push me and
[2:01:18] well we could study when you feel like
[2:01:20] it or that's the case our bodies rarely
[2:01:25] feel like it we've got to make the
[2:01:30] choice and because of this choice is
[2:01:34] because of what we choose a portion of
[2:01:37] heaven awaits those who make the right
[2:01:39] choice let's just bow your heads for a
[2:01:42] moment here Church does this give you
[2:01:45] courage brother Ram said this should
[2:01:47] give you courage how many raise your
[2:01:48] hands say Lord thank you for the courage
[2:01:51] because you've ordained all these things
[2:01:53] in my life now I'm going to say lord

[2:01:58] the right choice or lead me to make the
[2:02:00] right choice help me to overcome

[2:02:23] us such courage to know you've ordained
[2:02:27] us to hear the message of the hour how
[2:02:32] we love marriage and divorce and seven
[2:02:34] seals of the seven churches hallelujah

[2:02:47] all these mysteries of this message that
[2:02:50] you give to us many many turns of years
[2:03:00] and eons ago in your mind you looked
[2:03:02] ahead to this day and saw that we would
[2:03:05] love you that we would love this message
[2:03:08] and because of that you elected us Scott
[2:03:12] and then you predestinated the events of
[2:03:15] our lives that we could receive the
[2:03:17] message the Lord we want to say to fresh
[2:03:21] we love your character because you're
[2:03:23] the God of truth I'm reminded of
[2:03:27] Revelation 19 when you come back from
[2:03:28] heaven for the Armageddon battle the
[2:03:31] Bible says you're called faithful and
[2:03:33] true that's what we love about you Lord
[2:03:38] you're true you keep your word you're
[2:03:41] faithful to your word you never lie like

[2:03:48] we love who you are we love all that you
[2:03:51] are this whole Bible we love everything
[2:03:53] and we just want to be submissive to
[2:03:55] your will we just want the courage to
[2:03:57] choose the narrow way dear God for broad
[2:04:03] is the way that leads to destruction but
[2:04:05] narrow is the way that leads to life I
[2:04:10] pray this message would strengthen the
[2:04:13] experienced warriors of the saints and
[2:04:15] give them fresh inspiration to choose
[2:04:18] the right path every day maybe they make
[2:04:24] glorious decisions as you're as the
[2:04:26] prophecy said about your prophet dear
[2:04:28] God maybe they make the correct and
[2:04:32] precise decisions maybe they choose the
[2:04:35] narrow path maybe they walk in their own
[2:04:37] choosing of God's will for their life
[2:04:41] may they make momentous decisions today
[2:04:44] dear God and this week to serve you dear
[2:04:48] God it helped me Lord we're not asking
[2:04:53] for a huge portion of heaven we just
[2:04:55] want a portion of heaven dear God that
[2:04:58] we can spend time eternity with you
[2:05:00] Heavenly Father and all on that day
[2:05:03] you'll say well done what a glorious
[2:05:05] decision you have made and you have had
[2:05:11] a tremendous victory in the love divine
[2:05:14] Oh glory Jesus glory I pray for these
[2:05:19] people that love divine would be
[2:05:22] victorious in their lives I pray for
[2:05:25] this church you strengthened us with
[2:05:26] that divine love for Lord faith operates
[2:05:30] by love may their love for you that you
[2:05:34] foresaw millions of years ago
[2:05:39] may that love motivate their faith to do
[2:05:43] works to glorify that great name Lord
[2:05:48] and then at the end of it we can go back
[2:05:50] and say well it really wasn't ivett
[2:05:52] labored but it was the grace of God that
[2:05:56] caused me

[2:13:13] choose the right path I choose you Jesus
[2:13:16] I pick you

[2:13:21] walk in that to bypass Oh God
[2:13:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Jesus
[2:13:31] will walk in that light such a beauty
[2:13:39] for moms where the dew drops of Mercy
[2:13:53] I Jesus just keep playing that let's
[2:14:12] remember brother Simon before we close
[2:14:14] Church right now he's got a spiritual
[2:14:17] lamp and he's walking in a dark country
[2:14:19] of Thailand and he's calling is there
[2:14:22] anybody that wants to serve Jesus Christ
[2:14:25] he's he's holding this look he's just
[2:14:27] trying to does anybody want to walk in
[2:14:29] this light and there's not one real
[2:14:32] message Church over there there's some
[2:14:34] that believe it but or believe something
[2:14:35] but not all of it and they're got
[2:14:36] perverted ways and so he's walking he
[2:14:39] said does anybody want to love Jesus who
[2:14:41] love Jesus and church let's pray that
[2:14:46] God will allow him to find those
[2:14:50] predestinated souls that would love
[2:14:52] Jesus for who he is not for just what he
[2:14:56] does and gives them finances and food
[2:14:58] but because of his word because of who
[2:15:01] he is he's taking two weeks off of work
[2:15:05] and losing that money so he can walk in
[2:15:07] the light say does anybody love not
[2:15:09] Jesus there anybody that wants to sit
[2:15:12] down with our busy schedule and hear the
[2:15:14] word and do a Bible study and hear about
[2:15:16] my Jesus that I love maybe you were
[2:15:21] called to that but brother Simon's had
[2:15:22] to choose the harder way for him he's
[2:15:25] had to choose to do missionary work and
[2:15:27] I think this is his fourth trip now and
[2:15:29] he still he still told me said I'm
[2:15:31] looking for somebody that'll be born
[2:15:32] again like a pastor and start a church
[2:15:36] just a church we know if if God is
[2:15:40] leading him to go there's got to be
[2:15:41] somebody out there that loves God
[2:15:46] doesn't run his business well maybe
[2:15:47] somebody be saved in Thailand if it's
[2:15:49] God's genuine leading there is somebody
[2:15:51] there
[2:15:52] that really loves Jesus let's just close
[2:15:55] on prayer with that I know it's 1:15 but
[2:15:57] let's pray
[2:15:59] father that I hit plan to say that I
[2:16:02] felt like you just led me to say that
[2:16:05] [Music]
[2:16:06] cotton blesses my heart to know that my
[2:16:10] brother in the flesh would leave this
[2:16:13] money behind his job take the time off
[2:16:15] and risk his life and Lord he's on a
[2:16:24] journey Lord like Abraham not really
[2:16:27] knowing where he's going but he's
[2:16:29] holding forth that light looking for
[2:16:32] that lost sheep and I believe it's you
[2:16:35] the great Shepherd who's guiding him to
[2:16:37] do that he's looking for that one sheep
[2:16:41] of the hundred that's lost in sin maybe
[2:16:47] they're lost in a abusive relationship
[2:16:50] maybe they're lost in drunkenness and
[2:16:53] marijuana addiction but I pray in Jesus
[2:16:57] Christ's name we agree in Jesus Christ's
[2:17:00] name you'd help him to find that
[2:17:03] predestinated a lost sheep Aliyah and
[2:17:06] you can bring those sheep home to the
[2:17:09] father's house hallelujah and bless our
[2:17:16] brother he's chosen the harder path
[2:17:20] strengthen him that our prayers be
[2:17:23] recorded in heaven may Lord you minister
[2:17:26] to brother Simon may he bring us a
[2:17:27] missionary port Lord of good tidings
[2:17:30] father raised of a pastor raised up a
[2:17:32] shepherd that will feed sheep no doubt
[2:17:35] about to feed some goats just like
[2:17:37] sometimes we do Lord we don't know for
[2:17:38] sure but but Lord while we're feeding
[2:17:42] the Sheep sometimes we feed the goats
[2:17:44] but Lord we don't know who they are so
[2:17:47] we just want to feed every herd dear God
[2:17:51] and then you'll separate it at the day
[2:17:53] of judgment you'll take that net and
[2:17:56] you'll separate it or you'll those
[2:17:57] angels will come and they'll harvest the
[2:17:59] tears from the wheat but we don't know
[2:18:02] dear God
[2:18:04] I pray you'd help them to hold forth
[2:18:06] that light is that some sheep might be
[2:18:10] found dear God thank you Lord strengthen
[2:18:14] him dear God bless our day today that's
[2:18:18] us as we go Lord God be with those who
[2:18:20] can't make it to tonight's service speak
[2:18:22] to them may your spirit guide them and I
[2:18:25] pray they would make the right choices
[2:18:27] dear God let them choose the narrow path
[2:18:32] let them choose the correct and precise
[2:18:34] decision let them make a momentous
[2:18:37] decision may they have a tremendous
[2:18:40] victory in the baptism of the Holy Ghost

[2:18:47] things church of what name do we ask it
