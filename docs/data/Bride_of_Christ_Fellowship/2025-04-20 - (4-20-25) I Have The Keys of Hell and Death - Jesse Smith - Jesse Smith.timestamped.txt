[0:00] of hell and death. We'll preach on the
[0:01] Lord Jesus today. Praise God. He's alive
[0:05] and
[0:10] well. Revelation
[0:22] 11:17. So we're thankful for such a
[0:24] special day. Now, yesterday I was feel I
[0:27] was thinking about, you know, how when I
[0:28] was a kid, I used to do egg hunts and
[0:30] stuff like that. So, we're not going to
[0:32] have an egg hunt today, but I do have
[0:34] toys for the kids. One little toy per
[0:36] family. Uh, so we get to play after
[0:39] service by God's grace.
[0:41] So, and I heard, you know, I listened to
[0:43] a Jewish rabbi and he said they actually
[0:45] have a little event for the children uh
[0:48] on Passover where they go looking for
[0:50] leaven in the house. So it's so it's
[0:52] it's very similar to you know how kids
[0:54] go looking for eggs today. Raise your
[0:56] hand. Did anybody ever go looking for
[0:57] eggs when they were little? Was it just
[0:58] me, Austin? Okay, Chris. A
[1:01] couple. So I don't know if Christians
[1:04] took that idea from the Jews or Jews
[1:06] took that idea from the Christians. I'm
[1:08] not sure. I'd imagine the Jews had it
[1:09] first, but I don't know how orthodox
[1:11] those Jews were. But I thought I just
[1:14] felt, you know, a little feeling for the
[1:16] children. I got some new toys for the
[1:18] children, some balls and uh some bats
[1:20] and things like that and some just some
[1:23] play toys we can play with after service
[1:25] by God's grace. Hallelujah. But let's
[1:27] look at the word of God. How many
[1:28] looking forward to the word of God
[1:29] today? Hallelujah. Jesus said, "I have
[1:31] the keys of hell and death."
[1:34] Hallelujah. Revelation 11:17 and 18.
[1:40] I'll read 17 and we can all read 18
[1:42] together. The Bible says, "And when I
[1:44] saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And
[1:48] he laid his right hand upon me, saying
[1:50] unto me, fear not. I am the first and
[1:54] the last." Let's read 18 together. 1 2
[1:57] 3. I am he that liveth and was dead, and
[2:01] behold, I am alive forever more. Amen.
[2:06] And have the keys of hell and death. May
[2:09] God add his blessing to the reading of
[2:11] his word. You can be seated.
[2:17] So again, we're happy to be here in the
[2:19] house of the Lord today. I want to thank
[2:20] you for your prayers. Uh we had good
[2:21] travel on Friday. Brother Rod and I
[2:23] drove 11 hours down to Williamsburg and
[2:26] picked up the car he wanted to give
[2:28] away. That was very kind. And then I
[2:30] drove home four hours on Friday night
[2:33] and then I drove the rest yesterday. I
[2:35] slept pretty good last night. About
[2:36] eight hours of rest. That's usually
[2:38] that's a lot for me. So I feel pretty
[2:40] good today. Uh but we'll just have one
[2:42] service. You can rest today, spend time
[2:43] with your family, and uh trust you'll
[2:46] have a wonderful day resting in the
[2:47] Lord. Praise
[2:50] God. We uh also want to uh I want to
[2:53] read a few quotes from God's prophet,
[2:54] brother Brandham, about how this is the
[2:55] greatest week in the message Easter Seal
[2:58] in
[3:00] 1965. Uh brother Ram said that this
[3:02] coming week, he was speaking the week
[3:04] before Easter, is the most and the
[3:06] greatest historical week of all the
[3:07] weeks of the year. I think that the
[3:10] greatest thing we can celebrate this
[3:11] week, the greatest event that ever take
[3:14] place on the earth, I don't think
[3:16] anything could surpass it. You say,
[3:19] "Well, the crucifixion was great, but
[3:21] many man has died. Many men has been
[3:23] crucified even in the some even in the
[3:25] same days of our Lord." But there was
[3:27] only one of them who raised up from the
[3:30] dead that sealed it. Praise God. So, we
[3:32] know the death, burial, and resurrection
[3:34] of Jesus is the greatest event. He's the
[3:37] only one that defeated death.
[3:38] Hallelujah. And then he says here, I
[3:41] think as savior when Jesus died and as
[3:44] an infant when he was born, he could not
[3:46] have been here less being coming to the
[3:48] earth. And when he died, certainly he
[3:50] atoned for our sin. But yet there's many
[3:53] fine little babies born. There's been
[3:55] many men who suffered and died for a
[3:56] real cause. But there never was one that
[3:59] could raise himself up again until this
[4:02] day, until the day of Christ. Now, this
[4:04] is the greatest week in history. the
[4:06] greatest celebration of all times. This
[4:08] Easter is where he proved what he had
[4:11] said. Men can say things, but yet it
[4:13] isn't exactly what can be believed upon
[4:15] thoroughly until it's been proved to be
[4:17] the truth. And as God God said, "Prove
[4:20] all things. Hold fast that which is
[4:22] good." He would not tell you to do
[4:24] something that he could not do himself.
[4:26] So he proved who he was that he died for
[4:29] our sins and rose for our justification.
[4:31] Hallelujah. So we're thankful, you know,
[4:33] as we even saw on Wednesday night, you
[4:35] know, God has shown through all res or
[4:38] I'm sorry, all nature that he has
[4:40] resurrected. Hallelujah. Remember, we
[4:42] went through the number three on
[4:43] Wednesday, went through the number four.
[4:45] All these earthly numbers, these per
[4:47] perfect numbers, all these numbers show
[4:49] us that Jesus Christ is the way to
[4:51] salvation. He's God's son. Hallelujah.
[4:54] Now, the word key, I want to look at
[4:55] that word key in Revelation 1:18. The
[4:58] Bible said he has the keys of death and
[5:01] hell.
[5:02] Now the word key means the keeper of the
[5:05] keys who has power to open and
[5:09] shut and it's used in the New Testament
[5:12] to signify power and authority of
[5:15] various kinds. Hallelujah. So Jesus now
[5:19] has the power to open and shut death and
[5:23] hell. Hallelujah. Now church, he even
[5:25] proved this before he was uh crucified.
[5:28] I think he raised, if I'm not mistaken,
[5:29] he raised three people from the dead.
[5:31] even before he died. Hallelujah. So
[5:33] there was three funerals that he uh
[5:36] interrupted and brought life out of
[5:38] death.
[5:39] Hallelujah. Already proving that he had
[5:41] the power but he had to go down to hell
[5:43] to actually gain the full power and
[5:45] rescue those who are waiting in the
[5:47] heart of the earth. Praise God. So Jesus
[5:49] has power to open uh hell. Hallelujah.
[5:53] Power to uh to to shut death.
[5:56] Hallelujah. To to open up life.
[5:58] Hallelujah. He has power. He has the
[6:01] keys of death and hell. Hallelujah. And
[6:04] church, that gives us so much
[6:05] consolation. Even when we have loved
[6:07] ones who passed away, maybe untimely, or
[6:09] maybe they lived a full life, we have
[6:11] such confidence because Jesus has power
[6:14] over their life. Jesus has power over
[6:17] their death. Hallelujah. Jesus has power
[6:20] over all of it. Hallelujah. And we know
[6:22] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[6:24] forever. Praise God. And he and we know
[6:27] Jesus can save to the uttermost. So no
[6:29] matter how far it seems like people are
[6:31] far from God, Jesus can reach his
[6:33] almighty hand. He can reach even to them
[6:36] to save their souls. Hallelujah. He can
[6:39] deal with them. And the Bible said even
[6:41] in Job that he'll minister through their
[6:42] dreams. And God will speak to people
[6:44] through their dreams so that when they
[6:46] wake up, they'll have a new inspiration
[6:48] on God. Hallelujah. Or they'll have
[6:50] faith in God. God can save through
[6:52] dreams. God can save through the
[6:54] preaching of the word. God can save
[6:56] through visions. Hallelujah. He can save
[6:58] to the uttermost. Hallelujah. And he has
[7:01] power as he proved there even on the
[7:03] cross as he's in the middle the middle
[7:05] cross. We listen to that song on the way
[7:07] here. Uh he even proved there he can
[7:09] extend forgiveness uh to the lowest of
[7:12] the low uh thieves and murderers. If
[7:15] they only recognize that Jesus is holy,
[7:18] Jesus is worthy. If they can just judge
[7:21] that the word is right and if they just
[7:23] ask and call upon the name of the Lord,
[7:25] they shall be saved. Hallelujah. Jesus
[7:28] gives us power. Hallelujah. He gives the
[7:31] power to save from death. And of course,
[7:33] he rescued from hell as we'll review
[7:35] here today uh by the grace of God. So,
[7:38] if you have your Bible, let's go uh to
[7:40] uh scripture here. Let's go uh to 1
[7:43] Peter 3. We'll go there and see again.
[7:46] We'll read that. How uh Jesus conquered
[7:49] death.
[7:50] Hallelujah. 1 Peter
[7:53] 3. Sorry, my Bible was down here. 1
[7:56] Peter
[8:05] 3:18. Hallelujah. So the Bible says in
[8:11] 3:18, "For Christ also hath once
[8:13] suffered for sins, the just for the
[8:16] unjust, and that ought to make us
[8:17] rejoice. He suffered for sins that we
[8:20] don't have to suffer for our sins."
[8:22] Hallelujah. The just for the unjust. We
[8:25] are the unjust. Hallelujah. So often we
[8:28] look at others and well, they're not
[8:29] saved and they're unjust. But really, we
[8:31] were all at that point. Hallelujah. We
[8:33] were all unjust. And Jesus was the just
[8:36] one, the righteous one, that he might
[8:38] bring us to God, being put to death in
[8:41] the flesh, but quickened by the spirit.
[8:44] Amen. So, let's be encouraged. We are
[8:47] brought to God today. Hallelujah. He
[8:49] brought us to God. And remember, Acts 17
[8:53] says, "He's not far from each one of
[8:55] us." Hallelujah. That's right. And verse
[8:58] 19, by which also he went and preached
[9:01] unto the spirits that were imprisoned.
[9:03] So the body of Jesus remained in the
[9:05] tomb of Joseph of Arythea and the spirit
[9:08] of Jesus descended down into the depths
[9:11] of hell. That's right. And church, while
[9:14] he was down there, look how look at how
[9:15] he what what he does. He preaches to the
[9:19] disobedient souls in 1 Peter 3:20 which
[9:22] were sometime disobedient when once the
[9:24] longsuffering of God weighed in the days
[9:26] of Noah while the ark was the preparing
[9:29] where in few that is eight souls were
[9:31] saved by water. Listen church if you
[9:34] ever get frustrated with preaching let
[9:36] me encourage you change your heart
[9:39] because look at this. These people are
[9:40] lost and they've still got to listen to
[9:43] preaching. So many people run from
[9:45] preaching. they they get discouraged or
[9:47] something like that. Church, turn to
[9:48] God. Repent. Don't get angry with the
[9:50] preaching. Accept the preaching.
[9:52] Hallelujah. Change your attitude so the
[9:55] preaching will help you, not so you'll
[9:56] be upset with it. Hallelujah. Amen.
[9:59] Because if you don't accept it now, if
[10:00] you don't receive the preaching now,
[10:01] you're still going to have to listen to
[10:03] it. Amen. So, let's listen to preaching
[10:05] while we can have the mercy of God to
[10:08] accept it. Hallelujah. And the preaching
[10:10] will benefit us so that we can go to
[10:12] heaven. Hallelujah. and not still have
[10:14] to hear preaching even after there's no
[10:16] hope for us. Let us receive the
[10:18] preaching today with hope. Hallelujah.
[10:21] That will be saved. Hallelujah. So
[10:24] either way, they're going to have to
[10:24] hear preaching. So you might as well get
[10:26] used to it. You might as well love it.
[10:28] Hallelujah. If you don't love it, say,
[10:30] "Lord, change my heart. I want to love
[10:31] the preaching of the word."
[10:34] Hallelujah. Eight souls are saved by
[10:36] water. Verse 21. the like figure where
[10:39] unto even baptism doth also now save us.
[10:42] Not the putting away the filth of the
[10:43] flesh, but the answer of a good
[10:45] conscience toward God. See, you and I
[10:47] putting our sins away, that's not what
[10:48] saves us. Well, I overcame smoking. I
[10:51] overcame drinking. I That's not what
[10:53] actually did it. It's what Jesus did for
[10:56] us. Hallelujah.
[10:58] Jesus gave you the power to put away
[11:00] these addictions, the power to put away
[11:02] those bad habits. But it was all Jesus
[11:06] that did it. Hallelujah.
[11:08] It was you had a good conscience. Your
[11:10] conscience looked at Jesus. He died for
[11:12] me. Uh all my sin went on him. I accept
[11:16] him. I believe in him. It was the good
[11:18] conscience. It was the faith that you
[11:21] received. That's what God has for us to
[11:23] be saved by. Saved by grace, not of our
[11:26] works of putting away. Now, we can
[11:28] rejoice. Thank God I overcame. Thank God
[11:30] I overcame. Thank God I overcame. But
[11:32] that's not what saves us. We're saved
[11:34] because we judge Jesus as the lamb of
[11:36] God who takes away our sin. Hallelujah.
[11:40] That's
[11:41] right. See, and by the resurrection. So,
[11:44] we have a good conscience toward God
[11:46] because we know Jesus died for us and
[11:48] raised for us as well. Praise God. Who
[11:52] has gone into heaven and is on the right
[11:53] hand of God. Angels and authorities and
[11:56] powers being made subject unto him.
[12:00] Now, the Bible says in Hebrews 2:14,
[12:02] "Before Calvary, Satan held the keys of
[12:05] death and hell because Satan uh deceived
[12:09] Eve and then uh Adam gave into sin." And
[12:13] the Bible said in 2 Peter 2:19, "For of
[12:16] whom a man is overcome, the same as he
[12:19] brought in
[12:20] bondage." Hallelujah. So, for the next
[12:23] 4,000 years after Adam and Eve fell,
[12:26] Satan had all even believers in bondage.
[12:29] Remember, the Bible said they would
[12:31] offer in Hebrews 10, they'd offer
[12:33] sacrifices, but their conscience never
[12:35] really got clean.
[12:37] But the Bible says in the New Testament,
[12:39] our conscience should be clean.
[12:42] Hallelujah. Because we have a more
[12:44] powerful blood. We have the blood of
[12:46] God. The Bible says a creative blood of
[12:49] God, not animal blood, which only covers
[12:51] over, but creative blood of God that
[12:54] abolishes all the sin, sends it away,
[12:57] remits it. And the Bible said total
[12:59] forgiveness or true forgiveness,
[13:01] forgiveness of all of our sins.
[13:04] Hallelujah. So the blood of God's lamb
[13:07] takes away the sin.
[13:10] Hallelujah. And so Jesus came and the
[13:13] Bible said without shedding of blood,
[13:14] there's no remission of sin. And Jesus
[13:18] shed the blood that our sins would be
[13:20] forgiven. Hallelujah. The blood of bulls
[13:23] and goats can never take away sin. 1
[13:25] Corinthians 15 says, "For since by man
[13:28] came death, by man came also the
[13:30] resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam
[13:33] all
[13:34] die, even so in Christ shall all men be
[13:39] alive." All of us can look at our flesh
[13:42] and at some point or another, we can see
[13:43] our bodies die because of what Adam did.
[13:46] We're descendants of Adam. Hallelujah.
[13:48] We're descendants of Adam and Eve and of
[13:50] course Noah's offspring. And we're and
[13:52] our bodies are all going to die because
[13:54] of that. But if we have faith in Christ,
[13:57] we're we have the promise that we shall
[13:59] live. Hallelujah. Our souls shall not
[14:02] die. Our soul souls shall not be
[14:04] separated from Christ. Our souls are
[14:06] Christ. They belong to Christ. And our
[14:09] souls will be with him forever
[14:11] throughout eternity. Hallelujah.
[14:14] God could not die in the spirit form. So
[14:16] he had to create a body that he could
[14:18] dwell in. Hallelujah. The Bible said, "A
[14:21] body hast thou prepared me." Hallelujah.
[14:24] And then God sent that body called
[14:26] Emmanuel. God with us. God sent that
[14:28] body to the cross. Hallelujah. And I
[14:31] love what Hebrews 10 says, "For by one
[14:33] offering he hath perfected forever them
[14:36] that are sanctified, and their sins and
[14:39] iniquities will I remember no more."
[14:42] Church, God, don't remember your sins
[14:44] when you confess your sins. Amen.
[14:47] Hallelujah. Satan likes to whisper and
[14:49] all the time, remember this, remember
[14:51] that. Look what you did there. Look what
[14:52] you did there. But you have a scripture
[14:54] to say, God doesn't remember it. I
[14:57] confess it. Hallelujah.
[14:59] You got to take us, you either got to
[15:00] believe Satan or rebuke him. Let's
[15:02] rebuke him. Let's cast him down. Jesus
[15:05] did away with our sins. Hallelujah.
[15:08] God does not remember it. Hallelujah.
[15:10] And the Bible said where the remission
[15:12] of these sins are, there is no more
[15:15] offering for sin. We don't need Jesus to
[15:18] die again for the sins we commit today
[15:19] or tomorrow or the next day. That one
[15:22] sacrifice wipe them all out. Praise God.
[15:25] Amen. We need to trust in the sacrifice,
[15:28] the lamb of God that God has already
[15:30] sent. We need to trust that it is a
[15:32] finished work. Hallelujah. And it has to
[15:34] be finished because Jesus rose up. I'm
[15:36] sorry. God rose up Jesus from the dead
[15:39] as proof that it is finished.
[15:41] Hallelujah. And he even said it.
[15:43] Hallelujah. It is finished.
[15:46] Glory. Now, we know uh Jesus went into
[15:50] the heart of the earth, the Bible says,
[15:52] and he took the keys of death from
[15:54] Satan. Hallelujah. Brother Ram
[15:57] dramatizes it and we've gone before, but
[15:59] the Bible said uh the Bible said that
[16:02] Satan didn't know what was going on. The
[16:05] Bible said none of the princes of this
[16:07] world would have crucified him had they
[16:09] known what God was accomplishing.
[16:12] Hallelujah. That's right. If Herod and
[16:15] Pilate and especially Satan had known
[16:17] what Jesus would accomplish after his
[16:19] death, they would not have helped
[16:21] crucify him. What was it going to
[16:24] accomplish? We've talked about it. The
[16:25] spirit of burning. It's going to
[16:27] accomplish people that are filled with
[16:29] the same spirit that was in Jesus.
[16:30] Hallelujah. And they would be true
[16:33] witnesses. Hallelujah. They'd have true
[16:35] power and they'd be able to say,
[16:36] "Greater is he that's in me than he
[16:38] that's in the world." Amen. And because
[16:41] he lives, I shall live also. Praise God.
[16:44] They would not have done it. They would
[16:46] not have sent him to the cross if they
[16:48] had known that the spirit that was on
[16:50] Jesus was now going to come upon all the
[16:52] believers. Hallelujah. Satan would not
[16:55] have crucified Jesus if he knew Jesus
[16:57] was going to come down down there and
[16:59] rescue all his Old Testament saints.
[17:01] Hallelujah. And help them to ascend on
[17:03] high and lead captivity into a greater
[17:06] cap captivity, a holy captivity. Amen.
[17:10] Satan would not have him crucified if he
[17:12] knew he knew he's going to lose all of
[17:13] his prisoners down there. But Jesus come
[17:16] down there and open the prison doors. He
[17:18] set them free, church. And he's already
[17:20] set you free as well. Hallelujah. You
[17:23] don't have to go to hell. Hallelujah.
[17:24] You don't have to be a slave. He's
[17:26] already set us free. Many of us just
[17:28] have to accept it. Hallelujah. Oh, glory
[17:31] to
[17:33] God. And I love that. Pull up Psalm
[17:35] 16:10. Hun. I love how Jesus or God hid
[17:39] the resurrection in one verse here in
[17:41] Psalm
[17:43] 16:10. For thou will not leave my soul
[17:45] in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine
[17:48] holy one to see corruption. There's over
[17:51] 23,000 verses in the Old Testament.
[17:54] Hallelujah. So 10% would have been 2,00
[17:58] uh 300,
[17:59] right? Uh 1% would have been 230 verses.
[18:05] So, one verse out of 23,000 is of the
[18:08] smallest of
[18:10] percentages. A percent of 1%, a very
[18:13] small percent, a tiny little percent.
[18:16] God hid the revelation in one verse.
[18:18] Hallelujah. It might seem insignificant,
[18:21] but there was so much power in this one
[18:24] verse, church. That's how your life is.
[18:26] You're just one little insignificant
[18:27] person, but God can hide his power in
[18:30] you and I. Hallelujah.
[18:32] Resurrection power. Amen. Think about
[18:35] that. Satan knew the verses. Brother
[18:37] said Satan could quote the entire Bible
[18:38] because he's a supernatural being. So,
[18:40] Satan knew the entire Bible, but he
[18:42] didn't have the revelation of the
[18:44] scripture. So, he missed seeing this
[18:47] that God would not leave uh the spirit
[18:50] of Jesus in hell, but God would raise
[18:52] him up. Hallelujah. And so, we're
[18:55] blessed to know this that God hides his
[18:58] word, his revelation between the lines.
[19:01] And the Bible says that you and I have
[19:04] treasure in our earth and vessels. This
[19:07] was a treasure hidden in the scripture.
[19:09] And so now you have the spirit of God.
[19:11] And the spirit of God is hidden in your
[19:14] flesh. Hallelujah. It's hidden in your
[19:16] vessel. Praise be to his name.
[19:19] Hallelujah. I like Acts 2 verse
[19:23] 24. Let's read that. Acts 2:24. The
[19:26] Bible said that Jesus has loosed the
[19:28] pains of death. So any pain you feel or
[19:31] any fear that you have of death, Jesus
[19:34] has loosed us from that. We should not
[19:37] fear death for our loved ones, for us.
[19:39] Jesus has loosed us from those pains.
[19:42] See, they had the pain. You know, David
[19:44] and Job wondered Jed, they go down. We
[19:47] don't hear from them again. But then of
[19:48] course, Job got the revelation. He said,
[19:50] "I know my redeemer lives and I'll stand
[19:53] on the earth with him in the last day.
[19:55] In my flesh, I shall see God."
[19:57] Hallelujah. Amen. But they wondered
[19:59] before that.
[20:01] Hallelujah. But Jesus loosed the pain or
[20:04] the fear of death. Hallelujah. And the
[20:07] Bible said it was not possible that he
[20:09] should be holden of it. Praise God.
[20:12] Death could not hold Jesus because Jesus
[20:15] never sinned. Hallelujah. The wages of
[20:18] sin is death. So what the we the
[20:22] punishment for sin is death. But Jesus
[20:25] never sinned. So death could not hold
[20:27] him. It was impossible for death to hold
[20:29] him. He was more powerful than death.
[20:31] Hallelujah. Now say like this. He's more
[20:34] powerful than death today. Hallelujah.
[20:36] He's more powerful than sin today. Any
[20:39] sin that could try to hold you. Any
[20:41] stronghold, any complex, any addiction,
[20:44] his power, his spirit gives us power to
[20:47] be loosed from those things today. Death
[20:50] and sin cannot hold a true believer
[20:52] today. Hallelujah.
[20:54] That's right. Hallelujah. If death
[20:56] couldn't hold him, neither can any demon
[20:57] hold us. Praise God. Because it's not
[21:00] possible. The spirit of God gives us the
[21:03] victory. Hallelujah. And then the Bible
[21:06] says in Matthew 27 that they uh the the
[21:08] saints from the Old Testament came up
[21:10] out of the graves after his resurrection
[21:13] and went into the holy city and appeared
[21:15] unto many. Job's prophecy had come true.
[21:19] Job had been waiting for over almost
[21:21] 2,000 years because he had said, "I know
[21:23] my redeemer liveth." And he shall stand
[21:26] a at the latter day upon the earth. And
[21:28] though my skinworms destroy this body,
[21:31] yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I
[21:35] shall see for myself, and mine eyes
[21:37] shall behold and not another, though my
[21:40] reigns be consumed within me. Imagine
[21:43] Job had prophesied that. And no doubt
[21:46] he'd wondered about it the rest of his
[21:48] life. But here Job is raised. And now
[21:50] Job sees Jesus here in Jerusalem and he
[21:54] could say he could say it. This day this
[21:57] scripture is fulfilled. Hallelujah. This
[22:00] day the prophecy God gave me is
[22:03] fulfilled. I'm standing in flesh and I
[22:05] see God. I don't see a second person. I
[22:08] don't see a third person. But I see
[22:10] Jesus. He's God. Hallelujah.
[22:12] Hallelujah. Glory to God. And then he
[22:15] was seen for 40 days. Now that's the
[22:17] hope we have. Brother Ram said, uh,
[22:19] Brother Ram said we might, uh, see our
[22:21] loved ones for a month or so. He said, a
[22:24] month or so. And I hope that's the case.
[22:27] I hope at this second resurrection,
[22:28] praise God. I hope that we see our loved
[22:31] ones and the saints of old for a month
[22:33] or so. Wouldn't that be a powerful
[22:34] month? Hallelujah.
[22:36] To see uh, Brother Brandham and Martin
[22:38] Luther and John Wesley and all the
[22:40] saints, New Testament saints down
[22:41] through the ages walking around.
[22:43] Hallelujah. Uh, just appearing to us.
[22:46] Brother said they just appear to you. He
[22:49] says, "And then you'll know in a few
[22:50] moments you'll be changed as well."
[22:52] Praise God. They got a change. They got
[22:54] a resurrection. If they're if I see
[22:56] them, I'll get a resurrection, too.
[22:58] Praise God. That's right. And then at
[23:02] the conclusion of the 40 days, Jesus
[23:04] ascended to heaven in a cloud in the
[23:07] sight of his apostles in Acts chapter 1.
[23:09] And then Ephesians 4:8 says, "When he
[23:12] ascended up on high, he led captivity
[23:15] captive." Hallelujah. He led them from
[23:17] the heart of the earth into the sixth
[23:19] dimension. Hallelujah. Or we'd say into
[23:22] the third heaven. Hallelujah. Or into
[23:25] paradise. Paradise changed its location.
[23:28] It went from the heart of the earth now
[23:30] to heaven. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And
[23:33] then Psalm
[23:36] 24:es 7-10 quotes it. And brother Ram
[23:40] said, "This is Jesus's voice saying,
[23:42] "Lift up your heads, oh ye gates, and be
[23:44] lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the
[23:47] King of glory shall come in." Look at
[23:49] Jesus saying, "Open up gates." Now you I
[23:53] think some people probably have that
[23:54] power on their phone now. You can just
[23:55] speak it and the garage door will open.
[23:57] I don't have that yet, but some people
[23:59] probably got it, right? Where'd they get
[24:01] that from? They got that from Jesus.
[24:03] Jesus is coming home and he says, "Lift
[24:06] up the gates, angels." Hallelujah. The
[24:08] King of glory is coming
[24:10] in. Go to the next verse, verse eight.
[24:13] And they say, "Who is this King of
[24:14] glory?" And the Lord answers and the
[24:16] people. Now, all the Old Testament
[24:18] saints answer back, "The Lord strong and
[24:20] mighty, the Lord mighty in battle." What
[24:22] battle did he fight? He fought on the
[24:24] cross.
[24:26] He fought by dying for our sins. That
[24:29] was the great battle. And brother B
[24:31] said, "Where did that battle actually
[24:32] get victory of?" It was in the Garden of
[24:35] Gethsemane. So where was his battle in
[24:38] prayer before he went to the cross?
[24:40] Where's your battle? Where are you going
[24:41] to get victory? In your prayer.
[24:45] Jesus got the greatest victory ever by
[24:47] praying for an hour before he was
[24:50] crucified. And church, sometimes we
[24:52] can't hardly pray one minute, right? But
[24:54] if Jesus got the greatest victory by
[24:57] praying for one hour, surely we can get
[24:59] a victory as well. Hallelujah. If we
[25:01] just spend some time with God, call out
[25:03] to God, ask him for strength. Ask him
[25:06] for victory. Hallelujah. He's mighty in
[25:08] battle. And church, you'll win your
[25:10] greatest battles in prayer.
[25:13] Hallelujah. If you haven't got many
[25:15] great battles yet is you haven't got to
[25:17] do some more prayer. Hallelujah.
[25:20] That's where you get your victory in
[25:21] prayer. That's where Jesus got the
[25:24] victory in prayer. And the church said,
[25:26] "Amen." That's
[25:28] right. Now, we can see it that it's the
[25:32] prayer that we get the victory. Praise
[25:35] God. That's why Jesus, we had that verse
[25:36] up yesterday. Jesus said, "Oh, Peter,
[25:38] couldn't you even pray with me one
[25:40] hour?" And look, he because he couldn't
[25:43] pray, look, he lost the
[25:45] battle. But look, God gave him another
[25:47] chance. And church, God is the God of
[25:50] second and third chances. Thank God he
[25:52] keeps giving us more chances.
[25:53] Hallelujah.
[25:57] Hallelujah. Now, and also Hebrews 12:2,
[26:00] Acacia, part of this prayer, yes, you're
[26:03] you're going to fight the battles, but
[26:04] through this prayer, you're going to
[26:06] find joy in
[26:08] prayer. Now, remember, all this was
[26:10] possible. Jesus taking the keys of death
[26:12] and hell. All this was possible because
[26:14] he prayed a longer prayer in the
[26:19] garden. Now, what the Bible say? We
[26:21] should look to who? Who should we look
[26:22] to today? Brother Jesse or brother
[26:23] Brandham or or uh brother uh Perry Green
[26:26] or something like this? No, we look to
[26:28] Jesus. Praise God. He's the author and
[26:31] finisher of our faith. He wrote the book
[26:34] about faith. He gave us all the keys to
[26:37] faith. Hallelujah.
[26:39] Who for the joy that was set before him
[26:42] endured the cross. So as he prayed, God
[26:45] must have showed him if you endure this,
[26:48] if you can endure Friday, Sunday's
[26:50] coming. Hallelujah. If you can just and
[26:53] think about the joy the the father must
[26:55] have showed him, you're going to suffer.
[26:57] You're going to suffer awfully like no
[26:59] man has ever suffered. But as soon as
[27:01] the suffering's over, you'll go down and
[27:03] rescue all my children. Amen. You'll
[27:06] rescue my children out of the prison
[27:08] house if you can just suffer for a
[27:10] while. church. If we can just suffer
[27:12] with people, pray for people, wait upon
[27:15] the Lord, then God will give us grace to
[27:17] win some souls. Praise God. Oh, the joy.
[27:21] So, in the suffering, and he, as he bled
[27:23] the drops of blood, he remembered also
[27:25] the joy. The joy is going to come
[27:26] Saturday. See, in the Old Testament
[27:28] saints, the joy is going to come Sunday
[27:30] when I show myself alive to my
[27:33] disciples. Praise God. The joy that was
[27:37] set before
[27:38] him. And church, in our lives, what do
[27:40] we got? We're have to endure shame as
[27:42] well. People are going to call us all
[27:44] kinds of names. Most of our families are
[27:46] probably going to reject us. We're going
[27:48] to get called this cult. We're going to
[27:49] get called that. We're going to get
[27:50] called holy roller. We're going to get
[27:52] called you think you're better than
[27:53] holier than thou. All these things. But
[27:56] church, through prayer, the Holy Spirit
[27:58] will show you there's joy that will be
[28:00] in front of you. You must suffer. You
[28:03] must struggle. But the struggle and
[28:05] suffering is worth it for the joy that's
[28:07] set before us. Hallelujah. Amen.
[28:10] Yes. You'll get your greatest battles,
[28:12] I'm sorry, your greatest victories in
[28:14] the battles that are on your knees in
[28:16] prayer. Hallelujah.
[28:18] That's how Jesus got the greatest
[28:21] battle.
[28:24] Hallelujah. Now Jesus has reigned and
[28:27] now he sits at the right hand of the
[28:29] majesty on high. And the Bible says he
[28:31] ever lives to make intercession for us.
[28:34] Hallelujah. Now, now church, we have the
[28:37] promise. If we should die and go to the
[28:39] grave, our body just goes to the grave.
[28:42] But our soul does not descend down. Our
[28:44] soul raises up to heaven.
[28:48] 2 Corinthians 5:1 says, "For we know
[28:51] that if our earthly house," let's say, I
[28:53] know. Ready? I know. We know. I know. If
[28:56] this house is dissolved, we have a
[28:58] building of God, a house not made with
[29:01] hands, eternal in the heavens. So,
[29:03] Brother Chris, if God would terry, as
[29:06] soon as my spirit leaves this body, I
[29:08] get a brand new one. Praise God. I know
[29:11] that. Why? Because Jesus promised it.
[29:13] Praise God. That's why he raised. He
[29:16] raised to give life over hell. He has
[29:19] the keys of hell. He conquered hell. And
[29:22] now he can open heaven and a new body, a
[29:25] new dwelling place, a new future. Praise
[29:27] God. New hope. He can open all this to
[29:30] you and I because he conquered death and
[29:32] hell. Amen.
[29:36] We have a house not made with hands,
[29:38] eternal in the heavens. For in this we
[29:41] grown earnestly, desiring to be clothed
[29:43] upon with our house which is from
[29:45] heaven. As you get older, Jose and
[29:48] Beatatric can probably say, "Amen." As
[29:49] you get older, you'll you'll grown for a
[29:51] new
[29:52] body. You'll grown. I'm I'm already
[29:55] groaning for that, too. I'm groaning for
[29:56] a new body that used to feel new like it
[29:58] used to. Praise God. But the Bible says
[30:01] we'll have that groaning. We're groaning
[30:03] though for a better house in our younger
[30:05] house. We're groaning for an eternal
[30:07] house. And that house is waiting for us
[30:10] in heaven. Praise God.
[30:13] Glory. And so now we can say that we're
[30:17] caught up into paradise. If our bodies
[30:20] should ever die here on earth, we should
[30:22] not fear death. Hallelujah. Because the
[30:25] joy that's set before us.
[30:29] Paul also said in 2 Corinthians 5, we
[30:31] are confident, I say, and willing rather
[30:34] to be absent from the body and to be
[30:37] present with the
[30:38] Lord. So Paul knew, I'm I was I'm
[30:41] willing to give my life as a martyr like
[30:44] those uh uh saints from Nigeria that
[30:46] gave their lives just this week. They're
[30:48] willing to be absent from the body so
[30:49] they can be present with the Lord.
[30:52] That's
[30:53] right. All right. So now that's a little
[30:56] review there for paradise. Hallelujah.
[30:58] Now, I just want to briefly go over
[30:59] there's at least seven. Now, these are
[31:01] just seven um really important ones, but
[31:04] they're all important. But there's at
[31:05] least seven types of Christ defeating
[31:07] death. The life of Adam is a is a
[31:10] foreshadowing of Christ. Jesus is called
[31:13] the last
[31:14] Adam. And Adam chose death to be with
[31:17] Eve. Adam wasn't deceived when he saw
[31:19] when he found his wife in the condition
[31:21] she was in. But he chose to take on her
[31:25] sin in order that he might uh be with
[31:29] her. Hallelujah. He chose to take sin on
[31:32] him in order that he might be with his
[31:34] wife. He was innocent but yet he chose
[31:37] to take on sin willingly just like Jesus
[31:40] willingly took on our sin.
[31:43] And through that he became one with his
[31:45] wife. Uh he redeemed his wife. And so
[31:48] Adam through his the taking on the sin
[31:50] redeemed because God showed Adam, I'm
[31:52] going to sacrifice some lambs for you
[31:55] and I'm going to put coats of skins upon
[31:57] you. I'm going to give a sacrifice so
[31:59] you can be forgiven and I'm going to let
[32:01] you have your wife. You and your wife
[32:03] will be together. Hallelujah. And Jesus
[32:05] took on our shame. Hallelujah. That we
[32:07] might take on his righteousness and
[32:09] forever be with Jesus. Hallelujah.
[32:12] Adam's wife came from his side. And the
[32:14] Bible says uh that we came from the mind
[32:17] of Christ. We were chosen in him.
[32:19] Ephesians 1:4. As all men die in Adam,
[32:22] all men live in Christ.
[32:25] Hallelujah. Isaac is the second type.
[32:28] Hebrews 11:17. Could you pull it up
[32:30] there? Hebrews 11:17, 18, and 19. The
[32:33] Bible said that God told Abraham, "Go
[32:35] sacrifice your son." But Abraham had a
[32:37] revelation. Even if God, even if he's
[32:40] killed, God can raise him from the dead.
[32:44] Hallelujah. By faith, Abraham, when he
[32:45] was tried, offered up Isaac. And he that
[32:47] received the promises offered up his
[32:49] only begotten son. That's a type of God
[32:51] the father of whom it is said that in
[32:53] Isaac shall thy seed be called. So God
[32:55] had already told Abraham, "Your seed is
[32:57] going to come through Isaac." So Abraham
[32:59] knew if Isaac dies, God's going to have
[33:01] to raise him from the dead because God
[33:03] already told me all the seed is coming
[33:06] through Isaac. Praise God. That's why
[33:08] Abraham could take his son to to kill
[33:11] him because he already had the promise
[33:13] of God. Hallelujah. And church, we
[33:15] already have the promise of God. If we
[33:16] die, we'll live again. Hallelujah. We'll
[33:20] just die here as far as we'll separate
[33:22] from here, but we'll live again and
[33:24] we'll live forever more for eternity.
[33:26] Eternity. Hallelujah. Verse
[33:29] 19. See, Abraham accounted. He knew God
[33:34] was able to raise him up even from the
[33:36] dead. from whence also he received him
[33:39] in a
[33:41] figure. Hallelujah. So Abraham when he
[33:43] received Isaac off the altar and put a
[33:46] substitute. Hallelujah. That was a
[33:48] figure of Jesus Christ. We are the seed
[33:51] of Abraham. We we deserve to die for our
[33:53] sins. But God took us off the altar and
[33:56] gave us Jesus. Hallelujah. To forgive
[33:58] the seed of Abraham. Amen. To pardon the
[34:01] seed of Abraham. You don't have to die.
[34:04] You don't have to be killed for your
[34:05] sins. You have to pay for your sins. God
[34:07] has provided a sacrifice. Hallelujah.
[34:13] Glory. The life of
[34:15] Joseph gives it as well. We know Joseph
[34:18] was sold for third or 20 pieces of
[34:20] silver. Jesus sold for 30. Joseph was
[34:22] hated by his brother, loved of his
[34:24] father, put in prison with two others.
[34:26] One died, one lived. Just like Jesus on
[34:27] the cross, one died, one lived. Joseph
[34:30] was given a gentile wife just as Jesus
[34:32] is given a gentile wife.
[34:35] The brothers don't like him. Just like
[34:36] the Jews rejected Jesus. Hallelujah. But
[34:39] I love what Joseph said. What you
[34:41] intended for evil, God meant for good.
[34:45] The Jews and the devils and all these,
[34:47] they they intended Jesus crucifixion to
[34:50] be for evil, but God turned it around
[34:52] and made it for good. That's why we call
[34:55] it Good Friday. Praise God. Amen. And
[34:59] then after that, Joseph becomes second
[35:00] in command, just like Jesus at the right
[35:02] hand of the father. And Joseph sustains
[35:05] the whole gentile world. He feeds the
[35:07] whole world. And that's what Jesus is
[35:09] doing now. He said, "I am the bread of
[35:11] life." Hallelujah. The only bread the
[35:13] world is receiving, the only spiritual
[35:15] bread is the word of
[35:17] God. So Jesus now as Joseph ruled over
[35:20] the Gentiles. So Jesus now rules and
[35:23] reigns over the Gentiles. The Jews don't
[35:25] know him. But Jesus will reveal himself
[35:27] to the 144,000 brothers all alone. His
[35:30] bride's not in the room. Hallelujah. So
[35:33] Jesus after the rapture, Jesus will
[35:34] leave us. He'll sneak down, reveal
[35:37] himself to the 144,000, and they'll
[35:39] recognize that that their brother has
[35:42] forgiven them. What they meant for evil,
[35:44] God meant for good. And God even gives
[35:47] the brothers chains of reignment. God
[35:49] even gives the brothers eternal life.
[35:52] Hallelujah. Even though they left Joseph
[35:54] for dead.
[35:56] Oh, the love of God. The third example
[35:59] is the Passover lamb in the days of
[36:01] Exodus. In Exodus chapter 12, the lamb's
[36:04] blood on the doorpost would cause death
[36:07] to pass over just like the blood of
[36:09] Jesus on our lives causes death to pass
[36:12] over. Oh church, death is not going to
[36:14] strike you. Hallelujah. I'm talking
[36:16] about spiritual death. Spiritual death
[36:18] cannot strike you because the blood of
[36:20] Jesus Christ is applied to your heart.
[36:22] Praise God.
[36:24] Death will pass over. The life's already
[36:27] been given. You already have the life of
[36:29] Jesus on display. It's on display in
[36:31] your daily life.
[36:34] The lamb offered was without blemish. 1
[36:37] Peter 1 says Jesus was the lamb without
[36:40] blemish. The lamb could have no broken
[36:42] bones. Exodus 12:46 and John 19:33
[36:46] through36 Jesus had no broken bones. The
[36:50] lamb was slain on the 14th day of Nissan
[36:52] at twilight according to Exodus 12 3 and
[36:55] 4. And Jesus died on the 14th day of
[36:58] Nissan. Hallelujah. Right before
[37:00] twilight around 3:00, he dismissed his
[37:02] spirit. Think about that. Brother Ram
[37:05] Brother said while Jesus was dying
[37:07] there, the Jews were in the temple up up
[37:10] the hill right on Mount Mariah. The Jews
[37:12] were in the temple offering the the
[37:14] Passover lamb and they were singing, "My
[37:16] God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[37:18] They're singing that while Jesus is
[37:20] saying it on the cross.
[37:23] Both are going on, right? But it was
[37:26] God. That's how much God wanted to show
[37:28] them. I'm fulfilling the word. That was
[37:30] a type and shadow. But Jesus is the
[37:33] reality lamb. Hallelujah. And that's why
[37:36] God ripped the temple from the top to
[37:38] the bottom. It was heaven breaking the
[37:40] veil. And now we're not kept out of the
[37:42] presence of God. Now we're invited to
[37:44] the presence of God. And that's what the
[37:46] presence of God is. The spirit of
[37:47] judgment and the spirit of burning. When
[37:50] you can judge yourself guilty of sin and
[37:51] confess your sin, that's God's spirit.
[37:54] Now you're in his presence. And now you
[37:55] say, "God, I I fully uh devote myself to
[37:58] you. I fully give you all my life." And
[38:00] the spirit of burning will come on your
[38:02] heart and burn in your soul. Give you a
[38:04] desire to serve Jesus. Amen.
[38:10] Hallelujah. Oh, the Passover
[38:14] lamb. The Bible says the blood was
[38:16] applied for their protection and also
[38:18] their safe travels. And that's what we
[38:21] have. We have faith in the blood of
[38:22] Jesus Christ and it guides us throughout
[38:24] all of our travels.
[38:26] Hallelujah. That blood is going to make
[38:28] the way. It's going to open the way that
[38:30] we can be justified, sanctified, and
[38:33] filled with the Holy Ghost. The blood is
[38:36] the beginning point of that journey.
[38:38] Hallelujah. And even the lamb was eaten
[38:41] as part of that meal. Exodus 12:8 says
[38:44] they ate part of the lamb. And at Jesus
[38:46] last supper, he said, "This is my body
[38:49] which is broken for you. Take, eat. Do
[38:51] this in remembrance of me. So as they
[38:54] parttook of the lamb, getting ready to
[38:56] leave, so we partake of the lamb,
[38:58] church, getting ready to leave.
[38:59] Hallelujah. Oh,
[39:02] hallelujah. The fifth one is the feast
[39:05] of first fruits. It was celebrated three
[39:07] days after the Passover. So it was on
[39:09] Sunday according to Leviticus 23:10 and
[39:12] 11. And Jesus rose on Sunday, the first
[39:15] day of the week. Praise God. The first
[39:17] fruits was the first wheat that came to
[39:19] maturity. And Jesus was the first mature
[39:22] Holy Ghostfilled believer, the first one
[39:24] to raise from the
[39:26] dead. And this first one was a sign. If
[39:29] this first crop became mature, the rest
[39:33] of the crop will come mature. If Jesus
[39:36] raised, so will you and I raise.
[39:38] Hallelujah. Because we're part of the
[39:40] crop of God. We're not serpent seed.
[39:43] We're not cursing the word. We're loving
[39:44] the word. We're blessing the word. We
[39:47] are we wheat seed children of almighty
[39:50] God.
[39:51] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. This was
[39:54] offered the first fruits was offered
[39:56] without any leaven. And Jesus had no sin
[39:59] in his
[40:00] life. He was free from leaven. But
[40:02] remember we went over the Pentecost that
[40:04] had leaven in it because our lives still
[40:05] have sin in it. But what does God do? He
[40:08] still he still waves us before the
[40:09] people. Right? Like the church is like a
[40:12] city on a hill that cannot be hidden.
[40:14] Praise God.
[40:16] And then the Bible says in 1 Corinthians
[40:18] 15, Jesus was raised first. He said
[40:21] every man according to his order. So
[40:24] church, God will put us in the order of
[40:26] the resurrection. We've got an order
[40:29] that we are going to take. We have a
[40:30] place. In other words, we have a
[40:32] schedule time. We're leaving in the
[40:34] rapture. Praise God. There's an order.
[40:37] Praise God. God has established it. The
[40:40] next going away is the rapture of the
[40:42] gentile bride of Jesus Christ. That's
[40:44] the next scheduled rapture. And you and
[40:46] I got our tickets. Hallelujah. We have
[40:49] the promise of God Almighty. Oh my. The
[40:53] six is the prophecy of Psalm 22. David
[40:56] wrote this a thousand years before Jesus
[40:58] was crucified. And I think it was 500
[41:01] 700 years before crucifixion was even
[41:03] invented. Verse one, David wrote, "My
[41:06] God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[41:08] Jesus quoted this in Matthews 27:46.
[41:12] verses six or seven and eight say he was
[41:15] mocked and ridiculed. David said, "I've
[41:17] been mocked. I've been ridiculed." And
[41:19] Jesus was mocked and ridiculed. In verse
[41:22] 14 and 15, he went through physical
[41:24] suffering and dehydration. In John 19
[41:27] says, Jesus said, "A thirst, I am a
[41:29] thirst." He went through suffering and
[41:32] dehydration. Verse 16, he said, "My
[41:35] hands and my feet are pierced." And
[41:38] Jesus got uh three crosses, right? Three
[41:41] crosses. I'm sorry. Three nails, one
[41:43] cross forgiven. I like that sign. I saw
[41:45] it at at the Menanite church.
[41:47] Hallelujah. Three crosses, but one plus
[41:49] one cross is forgiven. Praise
[41:52] God. Verse 16 said he was surrounded by
[41:56] his enemies. And Jesus was surrounded by
[41:59] all those that wanted to crucify him.
[42:01] Verse 17, the Bible said, "My bones
[42:03] stare at me." So think about that,
[42:05] church. His head was down. He could see
[42:07] all the bones in his body here. His his
[42:09] ribs. It was ri ripped so much rip
[42:12] ripped wide open. He could see the bones
[42:14] there. And he did that for the joy that
[42:16] was set before him. He suffered so you
[42:20] and I could be healed. Praise God. Amen.
[42:23] He chose to stare at his bones and
[42:25] suffer and die in order to forgive us of
[42:28] our sins and heal our bodies. Oh, if he
[42:30] did that, church, let's accept it today.
[42:32] Praise God. Glory to
[42:35] God. In verse 18, the Bible said they
[42:37] cast lots for his clothes. And in John
[42:40] 1923 and 24, the soldiers cast lots
[42:43] broken up into four
[42:45] pieces. So David foretold this, foretold
[42:48] uh the resurrection, the death, burial,
[42:50] and resurrection of Christ. And we know
[42:52] the resurrection was in Psalm 16. Now,
[42:55] the last one we'll get to here before I
[42:56] move on to the main point I want to get
[42:57] to. This is all kind of leading up. I
[42:59] want to end with David here. But the
[43:01] last one is Jonah. In Jonah 11:17, the
[43:04] Bible said he was in the whale of the
[43:05] belly three days and three nights. Now
[43:08] in the Bible that just means within
[43:09] three days and three nights. Doesn't
[43:11] mean he was three days all three days
[43:13] and nights. It's
[43:14] within. And so was Jesus. He died on
[43:17] Friday uh in the heart of the earth
[43:19] Saturday. Sunday morning he rose. Jesus
[43:22] said in Matthew 12:40 that he uh that
[43:24] the son that the sign of the son of man
[43:26] was that he be in the heart of the earth
[43:28] as Jonah was in the heart in the whale
[43:31] or the whale the belly of the whale.
[43:33] Pardon me. And so Jonah's life is a
[43:36] beautiful type here of the death,
[43:39] burial, and resurrection of Jesus
[43:41] Christ.
[43:43] Hallelujah. Notice in in uh Jonah 1:12,
[43:46] Jonah's willing to give his life because
[43:48] he knows he's guilty. He's willing to
[43:50] give his life that others might be
[43:51] saved. What a type of Christ. Now, the
[43:53] difference is Jonah was guilty. Jesus
[43:56] wasn't. In Jonah 2: 1 and2, the Bible
[43:59] said the the whale took him to the very
[44:02] depths of the sea. And 1 Peter 3 says
[44:05] that Jesus descended down into hell. So
[44:08] both descended.
[44:10] Hallelujah. And then both raised up.
[44:13] Praise God. Jonah raised up, was vomited
[44:16] out, and started preaching in chapter 3
[44:19] verse4. He started preaching, except you
[44:21] repent in 40 days, you'll perish. So he
[44:25] re he was resurrected, given new life,
[44:27] and went to preaching. And Jesus was
[44:30] resurrected and started preaching. He
[44:33] said, "Go up to Jerusalem until you're
[44:34] endued with power from on high." Praise
[44:37] God.
[44:39] Amen. So we see a beautiful type there
[44:42] in the life of Jonah. There's seven. How
[44:45] many appreciate those by God's grace? I
[44:47] love seeing the types of Christ. Now,
[44:50] I'd like to go through a little type
[44:52] here. Now, brother tells us that
[44:54] Solomon, I'm going down. I'm now moving
[44:55] now to David and Solomon. Brother said
[44:57] Solomon is a type of the
[45:00] millennium. Okay, brother said Solomon's
[45:03] age was called the golden age of Israel.
[45:05] It was a type or a foreshadow of the
[45:08] coming of the Lord Jesus in the great
[45:09] millennium when the whole world would
[45:12] live in a golden age. How many looking
[45:13] for that golden
[45:15] age? Solomon foreshadowed
[45:18] Jesus. And when Jesus came, he had all
[45:21] the gifts, but God gave him the spirit
[45:23] without measure. And when he come, he
[45:26] was given the greater gift, the gift of
[45:28] wisdom there. So wisdom, Solomon reigned
[45:30] with with the gift of wisdom. And
[45:32] Solomon and Jesus reigns through the
[45:35] millennium with the wisdom of God.
[45:36] Praise God. Now, I want to show this
[45:39] visual here. I was just saving it for
[45:41] now. So, let's see if this this is kind
[45:43] of the point. I want to uh begin to
[45:46] bring my message down here. by God's
[45:47] grace. We'll see if it comes up.
[45:52] Okay. Now, I want to I want to just
[45:55] begin. I want to start here and just
[45:56] show I want to start with Calvary here.
[45:58] I want to look at the life of Old
[46:00] Testament and New Testament. I want to
[46:01] compare the life of David to the life of
[46:04] Jesus. Okay. Now, Solomon, brother said,
[46:07] represent the millennium. If that's the
[46:09] case, then we can go back and see
[46:11] through the life of David. We can see
[46:13] the foreshadowing of the work of Jesus
[46:15] Christ.
[46:17] Hallelujah. Now I want to start with
[46:20] Goliath. How this uh David defeating
[46:24] Goliath was a type of Jesus defeating uh
[46:27] death on the cross. Now David was from
[46:30] Bethlehem of Judah. So was Jesus born in
[46:33] Bethlehem.
[46:35] David was a shepherd. Jesus says, "I'm
[46:37] the good shepherd."
[46:39] Hallelujah. David was anointed amongst
[46:42] his brethren, right? This prophet
[46:44] anointed him. Jesus was anointed right
[46:46] by John the Baptist and the brethren
[46:48] right there. Praise God. It's a
[46:50] beautiful
[46:51] type. That's the final type I want to
[46:53] use
[46:54] here. But I want to look now at this.
[46:56] Let's look at Calvary and how David and
[46:59] uh David and Goliath was a foreshadowing
[47:02] of Jesus defeating our sin.
[47:06] Hallelujah. So David was a young
[47:08] shepherd overlooked by men even by his
[47:12] daddy. And I'm not going to repeat that
[47:14] Malachi and Zion. I'm going to I'm not
[47:15] going to look overlook your gifts in
[47:17] your life. Okay? Jesse overlooked
[47:19] David's gift. It seems like I'm going to
[47:20] see the gifts of God in the lives of my
[47:22] sons and my daughters by God's
[47:25] grace. But he was overlooked. He wasn't
[47:27] a trained soldier. And neither was Jesus
[47:30] a trained soldier as far as the natural.
[47:32] He was a carpenter son. He was rejected
[47:34] by the religious leaders. Not a military
[47:37] leader or king in any worldly
[47:40] terms. Right? And so God chooses an
[47:43] unexpected champion to come out and
[47:46] fight the giant. Jesus was an unexpected
[47:49] champion. The Bible said he had no
[47:51] beauty that we would desire him. But
[47:52] David was beautiful. So see there's a
[47:55] little there's not it's not a perfect
[47:56] type, but there's a type. So maybe
[47:59] David's natural beauty represented the
[48:01] spiritual beauty of
[48:02] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[48:05] So Jesus and David are both weak as we'd
[48:08] say by the human standards, but they're
[48:11] chosen to be king.
[48:13] Hallelujah.
[48:15] And both get the victory through
[48:17] supernatural means. Praise God. Now,
[48:21] David, of course, stands in place uh of
[48:23] Israel to fight Goliath. One man's
[48:26] victory becomes everyone's victory. Ah,
[48:30] Jesus stood in all of our place.
[48:32] Hallelujah. His death and resurrection
[48:35] brought victory to all of us. One man's
[48:38] victory gives you and I the victory.
[48:40] Praise God.
[48:43] Both of us, they David represented the
[48:45] the nation. Jesus represents the
[48:47] children of God.
[48:51] Hallelujah. David defeated Goliath with
[48:55] a stone which is a
[48:57] revelation. Hallelujah.
[48:59] and and then defeated him and cut off
[49:01] his head with his own sword. So David
[49:05] killed Goliath with a a revelation and
[49:07] his own sword. And Jesus had a
[49:09] revelation. I come to finish the work
[49:12] that God gave me to do. My meat is to do
[49:15] the will of God which sent me to do it.
[49:17] Praise God. So Jesus had a revelation
[49:20] through prayer. I'm to go to the cross
[49:21] of my God even sent Moses and Elijah
[49:24] down to show him his death. So God gave
[49:27] him a revelation by vision. You've got
[49:29] to go to the cross, but there's joy
[49:31] before you and you will defeat death
[49:34] through
[49:36] death.
[49:40] Glory. David used his enemy's own tool
[49:44] and revelation against him. Jesus uses
[49:48] Satan's own tool, his own keys against
[49:51] him. Praise
[49:52] God. Oh, glory. That's that's that's
[49:55] joyful today. That's that's victory
[49:57] today. Praise
[50:00] God. When David got the victory over
[50:03] Goliath, he broke the fear that
[50:06] paralyzed the entire
[50:08] army. As soon as they saw Goliath fall,
[50:11] like if he did it, glory, I can do it.
[50:14] Same thing Jesus did. Jesus' death and
[50:17] resurrection, it broke the fear of death
[50:19] and hell. And now we have power to go
[50:22] out into all the world and make
[50:24] disciples of every nation.
[50:27] Fear should be broken. And the church
[50:29] said, "We all battle fear, but remember
[50:32] God has not given us a spirit of fear,
[50:34] but of power, love, and a sound mind."
[50:39] David's victory led to him raising as
[50:41] king. After he defeated
[50:44] Goliath, the next step, of course, would
[50:47] eventually he'd be king. Jesus was
[50:49] resurrected and then he was exalted as
[50:51] King of Kings and Lord of Lords. So
[50:54] their victories begin to show the
[50:55] beginning. Now after this great victory,
[50:58] first the battle, then the crown. And
[51:00] church, let's remember that if you're
[51:01] battling today, get through the battle,
[51:03] win the battle, and the victories will
[51:05] be so wonderful. The spoils of victory
[51:08] will be so great if you can just
[51:09] overcome your battle today. Amen. Glory.
[51:13] The spoils of rewards will come after
[51:16] the victory. just fight the battle.
[51:18] Praise God.
[51:21] Hallelujah. And both, here's another
[51:24] one. Uh the final one here. Both were
[51:26] rejected before the battle. David was
[51:28] saying, "Oh, you're a naughty boy and
[51:30] get out of here." And Saul's like, "How
[51:33] could you do it?" Even even Goliath
[51:35] tried to say, "How are you sending a dog
[51:37] against
[51:38] me?" They're all mocked, doubted before
[51:41] the battle, right? So was Jesus. He was
[51:44] rejected by his people. He was
[51:46] misunderstood by his
[51:48] disciples. But yet he
[51:50] overcame o all all the doubt, all the
[51:53] confusion. He overcame all the
[51:56] negativity. Oh God, help us to overcome
[51:58] doubt and negativity. Praise God.
[52:02] Because I think you know where you're
[52:03] where I'm going with this. Jesus was
[52:06] David, but there were still more giants
[52:08] in the earth. Hallelujah. David didn't
[52:11] kill all the giants. in the church
[52:14] said, "Glory to God. It's resurrection
[52:17] day. Hallelujah. He's alive. Our king is
[52:20] risen." Praise God.
[52:24] Hallelujah. And so David defeating
[52:27] Goliath. He takes Goliath's own sword
[52:31] and defeats the enemy with his own
[52:33] power. It was a type of Jesus taking
[52:37] death. Jesus died. His death defeated
[52:40] death because Goliath represented
[52:43] certain death. That's why nobody would
[52:45] go fight him. So Jesus used Satan's own
[52:49] power to defeat him because life is more
[52:52] powerful than death. Hallelujah.
[52:55] And this was also a fulfillment church
[52:58] of Genesis 3:15.
[53:00] Remember God said that my your seed Eve
[53:04] your seed will bruise the head of the
[53:05] serpent. What was bruised? His legs, no.
[53:09] His arms, his stomach. What was bruised?
[53:11] His feet? No. The head was bruised. And
[53:14] what did David cut off? David cut off
[53:16] the head. Hallelujah.
[53:20] See, the seed of the woman, the seed of
[53:23] of Mary, Jesus would bruise the head.
[53:27] Hallelujah. And that head means
[53:28] dominion, right? Because the head has
[53:30] dominion over the whole body. I can send
[53:31] a message to do this. I can send a
[53:33] message to my head to do all these
[53:35] things. But when Jesus defeated uh
[53:38] Satan, that means the dominion of sin
[53:41] doesn't have to be over this. We don't
[53:43] have to stay the same. We can have power
[53:45] and dominion over sin in our lives.
[53:51] Hallelujah. Glory to
[53:53] God. So as the believers rallied around
[53:57] their champion, we rally around Jesus
[53:59] today. How many rally around Jesus
[54:00] today?
[54:02] Hallelujah. Now the point I want to make
[54:05] church is that
[54:07] uh Jesus descending down to
[54:09] hell was a type of after
[54:12] David after
[54:15] David after David killed Goliath. Yes,
[54:17] he was celebrated for a little bit but
[54:19] then a season I think it was 7 to 13
[54:21] years this season of rejection and
[54:25] humiliation and suffering came upon
[54:27] David. So that period before David
[54:30] becomes king of Hebrron. This period
[54:33] represents Jesus going down to hell.
[54:37] Hallelujah. Can everybody see that? So
[54:40] remember what happened to David? He was
[54:41] rejected by Saul. Saul put a bounty on
[54:44] his life. Saul or David went from cave
[54:47] to cave writing letters and complaints
[54:50] to God. What's going to happen to me?
[54:52] Wondering. And remember he even says in
[54:54] 1st Samuel 27, I'm going to die by the
[54:56] hands of Saul. So what does he do? He
[54:58] moves out of the promised land and he
[55:01] moves over into Philistine
[55:03] country. So listen, he leaves the place
[55:07] of blessing and goes to the place of
[55:09] cursing. And the church said, "What did
[55:12] Jesus do? He left the place of blessing
[55:14] and he went down to hell, the place of
[55:16] cursing."
[55:18] Hallelujah. That's right, church. He did
[55:21] that for you and I.
[55:23] He did it for us. Glory. Praise God.
[55:26] Jesus was
[55:27] rejected, humiliated on the cross. He
[55:30] suffered. But also during this time,
[55:33] David, he was there in the cave and
[55:35] remember all these mighty men came unto
[55:37] him and said, "We're debtors and we're
[55:39] the scum of the earth. We're the low
[55:40] lives, but can we join your army?"
[55:44] Oh, hallelujah. That's you and I. Praise
[55:47] God. Or I'm sorry, in this case, it was
[55:49] the Old Testament saints. Jesus went
[55:51] down into hell and he rallied his new
[55:55] army, his army of Job and Daniel and
[55:59] Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca and
[56:03] Esther and all these Old Testament
[56:05] saints. Now Jesus gets a new army.
[56:08] And what do they become? They become
[56:10] mighty men. And what do Jesus's uh
[56:13] people become? The bride of Jesus
[56:15] Christ. Praise God.
[56:18] They become the saints. They become I'll
[56:20] say this the celebrity of heaven. Praise
[56:22] God.
[56:24] Glory to God. Amen. Oh, I think that's
[56:27] beautiful type. Don't you?
[56:31] Now remember also now this is the other
[56:33] side. I want to give the other side of
[56:34] this because I heard a brother preach on
[56:35] it. The other side of this was David
[56:38] lied to King H. Akish. He lied on a
[56:41] couple
[56:42] occasions,
[56:44] right? And then what did he remember? He
[56:47] pretended like he was insane. He wasn't.
[56:49] He just pretended to be. He lied and
[56:52] said, "I've killed these uh
[56:53] Philistines." He actually I'm sorry,
[56:54] these Jews, these Israelites, he
[56:56] actually killed some some Philistines
[56:58] and lied to the
[56:59] king.
[57:01] Hallelujah. During this time, it wasn't
[57:04] a a very good time for David. And
[57:06] remember, he lost his whole family.
[57:09] Remember, he lost his two wives, Abigail
[57:11] and I can't remember the other
[57:13] one. While David was out fighting for
[57:16] the the Philistine king at uh all these
[57:20] armies came into Ziglag, he lost
[57:23] everything. Well, no wonder he was
[57:25] outside of the promise of
[57:27] God. Remember he came back and what who
[57:30] remembers what does the mighty men what
[57:31] does the mighty men want to do to him?
[57:32] Kill him. So what'd he do? Nobody would
[57:35] encourage him. No one in the church
[57:36] would encourage him. So what he do? He
[57:38] encouraged himself.
[57:41] I can't find anybody to encourage me.
[57:42] Nobody's texting me. Nobody's calling
[57:44] me. I I that's fine. God can encourage
[57:46] me. Praise God.
[57:48] If you have nobody else, be like David.
[57:51] Encourage yourself in the promise of
[57:53] God.
[57:54] Hallelujah. Now, we need each other. But
[57:57] let's learn from this that when when
[57:58] we're at our lowest of lowest spots, if
[58:01] we go to God, Amen. If we have that
[58:03] prayer like Jesus Gethsemane, God will
[58:05] encourage us. God will strengthen us.
[58:07] Praise God. Is that right?
[58:11] And then remember church, one of the one
[58:14] of the most surprising things at the
[58:16] very end he says he said, "King Akish,
[58:18] I'm going to go fight against Israel for
[58:21] you." He was he was one to be one of the
[58:24] guards for King Akish. Look at that. A
[58:26] child of God. Look at that. A future
[58:28] king fighting against his future
[58:30] people. And we wonder why there's fights
[58:32] in the church sometimes. The church
[58:34] said, "What happened to David? He got a
[58:36] lying spirit on him, right?
[58:40] He got a fear spirit on him. He was
[58:42] fearful about Saul killing
[58:45] him. And he gets out of the blessing. He
[58:48] leaves the promised land, the blessing
[58:50] of God. And church, all things are going
[58:52] to fall apart when you get out of the
[58:53] promise.
[58:55] He purposely left the promise of God and
[58:59] everything starts falling apart. But
[59:01] what is God faithful to do to his his
[59:03] future king? Send him back.
[59:06] Hallelujah. Empower him.
[59:09] And I I think I shared this with one of
[59:10] the brothers or a couple of the
[59:11] brothers. It was a good part of the
[59:14] sermon. When David lost everything, what
[59:16] did he do? He prayed to God. He said,
[59:17] "God, do you want me to go and restore
[59:20] everything? Should I go and restore?"
[59:23] And what did God say? "Go and you'll
[59:25] restore
[59:26] all." Now, church, he couldn't wait for
[59:28] God to restore it. He had to go fight
[59:30] for his family.
[59:33] That's what God's calling us to do.
[59:34] Fight for our loved ones. Fight for our
[59:37] families. And the church said, "Amen."
[59:39] He said, "You go do it." Doesn't the
[59:41] Bible say give all diligence to serve
[59:44] the Lord? Hallelujah. We can't sit back
[59:47] and just wait for God to do everything.
[59:48] We have to seek God. And if God says go,
[59:50] go recover, then we should go recover by
[59:53] the grace of God.
[59:55] That's right, church. Look at that. My,
[59:57] what a beautiful type. The same thing
[59:58] with Jonah. We see Christ and Jonah, but
[1:00:00] what was he? A man running from the
[1:00:03] presence of almighty God. Amen.
[1:00:06] So see, we can see the Christ in his
[1:00:08] life, but we can also see the failure in
[1:00:10] his life. And that's to encourage us
[1:00:13] even in our failures. In other words,
[1:00:14] we'll we'll we'll find our place. Amen.
[1:00:17] In the story of Jesus Christ, we'll find
[1:00:20] our
[1:00:21] lives. God can redeem our mistakes and
[1:00:24] God can uh God can take all of our
[1:00:27] mistakes and make our lives a beautiful
[1:00:28] thing.
[1:00:31] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:35] Now, my verse I wanted
[1:00:37] to especially focus on there
[1:00:41] was 1st Samuel 21:9. I'm I'll just read
[1:00:45] it. And I'm just going to par paraphrase
[1:00:47] it. In 1st Samuel 21:9, David arrives at
[1:00:51] NaB hungry and unarmed. He asked Ahemch
[1:00:54] the priest for food and a weapon. The
[1:00:56] only weapon available is the sword of
[1:00:58] Goliath,
[1:01:00] which had been kept there as a memorial.
[1:01:03] So, I'm going to use this just as a as a
[1:01:05] type. When David got the sword, he took
[1:01:09] the sword of his enemy and now he's
[1:01:11] fighting with the sword of his enemy.
[1:01:14] Hallelujah. And that's Jesus. Jesus
[1:01:16] going down to hell. He took the keys of
[1:01:19] hell. He took the keys of death and now
[1:01:22] he's got the power of the enemy. Amen.
[1:01:26] Hallelujah. Now Jesus has the power over
[1:01:30] death and hell. Praise God. David has
[1:01:33] power. He has the power of death now.
[1:01:37] He's He's got it, church. Through death,
[1:01:40] Jesus destroyed death. David defeated
[1:01:43] Goliath with his own sword. And Jesus
[1:01:45] defeated Satan with his own power. Go to
[1:01:49] Hebrews 2:9 if you got your Bible. We
[1:01:51] see Jesus made a little lower than the
[1:01:53] angels for the suffering of death,
[1:01:55] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[1:01:57] the grace of God should taste death for
[1:02:01] every
[1:02:02] man. So Jesus had to taste death. He had
[1:02:06] to die. David had to stand there sure
[1:02:08] death in front of Goliath. He had to
[1:02:10] stand there when no one else would stand
[1:02:12] there. David stood there where no one
[1:02:15] else would. Jesus stood there and died
[1:02:17] so we don't have to
[1:02:19] die. Hallelujah. There's my
[1:02:21] hour. I go a little bit further here.
[1:02:23] Now, we read these um verse 14, Hebrews
[1:02:27] 2:14. For as much then as the children
[1:02:30] are partakers of flesh and blood, he
[1:02:32] also himself likewise took part of the
[1:02:34] same, that through death he might
[1:02:36] destroy him that has the power of death,
[1:02:40] that is the
[1:02:42] devil. So, church, you and I, every one
[1:02:44] of us here have a promise today. We have
[1:02:46] the power to destroy Satan's influence
[1:02:49] over our lives.
[1:02:51] We don't have to keep losing to him. We
[1:02:53] can win over him. Praise God. Because
[1:02:56] we've got the power. We've got the power
[1:02:58] of life. And there's life in the sword
[1:03:01] of the word. Praise God.
[1:03:04] Don't forget, church. We're not going to
[1:03:06] read it, but don't forget Ephesians 6.
[1:03:07] Paul says, "Put on the whole armor of
[1:03:09] God. Put it on." And the last one is the
[1:03:12] sword of the
[1:03:13] spirit, which is sharp. It's so sharp.
[1:03:16] Go to Hebrews 4:12. It's so sharp. It
[1:03:19] discerns the thoughts and the tents of
[1:03:21] the heart. Hebrews
[1:03:30] 4:12. Oh my. This ties in perfectly with
[1:03:32] the uh spirit of judgment and the spirit
[1:03:34] of burning. The spirit of judgment comes
[1:03:37] to judge. Now listen in church. It'll
[1:03:39] judge. It's either a sin in your flesh,
[1:03:41] it's either a sin in your spirit, or
[1:03:43] it's a sin in your soul. And the church
[1:03:45] said, look at 4:12. I'm in 12:4.
[1:03:50] 4:12. For the word of God is quick and
[1:03:53] powerful and sharper than a two-edged
[1:03:55] sword, piercing even to the dividing
[1:03:56] ascender of the soul and spirit and the
[1:03:58] joints of the marrow. There's three
[1:03:59] parts right there. You got soul, spirit,
[1:04:02] joints, and marrow. So, body, spirit,
[1:04:06] soul, and is the discerner of the
[1:04:09] thoughts and intents of your heart. So,
[1:04:11] the word of God when it's preached or
[1:04:13] when you read it, it will help you judge
[1:04:15] where is the problem at? Is the problem
[1:04:17] in my flesh? Is the problem in my
[1:04:19] spirit? Or is the problem in my soul?
[1:04:22] Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] That's what the word of God does.
[1:04:26] Hallelujah. And now you've got the word
[1:04:28] of God and it recognizes the whether
[1:04:31] it's a spirit. Let's say it's a spirit
[1:04:32] of depression. That's in the spirit.
[1:04:35] See, the word of God discerns. You're
[1:04:37] losing the battle of the mind.
[1:04:40] Hallelujah. And so the spirit of God
[1:04:42] will show you, oh, it's a mind problem.
[1:04:44] So what must I do? I must cast down
[1:04:47] those depression thoughts.
[1:04:50] Or maybe it's a oh, the spirit of God
[1:04:52] will show you, oh, it's it's a it's a
[1:04:54] problem in your DNA or it's a problem in
[1:04:56] your body. You didn't do any sin, but
[1:04:58] it's a problem in your body. The spirit
[1:04:59] of God will show you that. And now it'll
[1:05:01] cut it out and say, okay, this is the
[1:05:03] part now. Lord, help me to speak the
[1:05:05] word of God. Heal my body. Bring my body
[1:05:08] into subjection to the word of God.
[1:05:10] Hallelujah. Or maybe it's a soul
[1:05:12] problem. You're not saved. You don't
[1:05:13] believe in Christ. you never repented of
[1:05:15] your sin. This the word discerns now
[1:05:17] into your soul and said this is a soul
[1:05:19] problem. You're not saved.
[1:05:22] But thank God we're saved here today.
[1:05:23] How many saved by the grace of God? See
[1:05:26] church. So where is the soul going to
[1:05:27] expose most of our troubles? In the
[1:05:29] human
[1:05:30] spirit. Hallelujah. Oh, it's a mind
[1:05:33] battle. It's a mind struggle. If you're
[1:05:35] saved, it's not going to be there. Or
[1:05:37] maybe it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:39] Now that's a soul
[1:05:40] issue. That's right. If it's the flesh,
[1:05:44] there's something in the flesh, the
[1:05:45] spirit of God will cut that open and oh,
[1:05:47] it's a it's a problem in your body. Or
[1:05:49] maybe you need the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:50] Ghost in your soul, the spirit of God
[1:05:53] will show you. The spirit of God will
[1:05:55] will discern or judge your thoughts.
[1:05:57] Yeah, the word discern means judge.
[1:05:59] There it is. Glory to
[1:06:01] God. Is a discerner or a judge of the
[1:06:04] thoughts intents of the heart. The
[1:06:06] spirit of
[1:06:08] judgment. So when the word of God comes,
[1:06:11] it will judge and say, "This is either a
[1:06:12] body problem, this is a spirit problem,
[1:06:15] this is a soul
[1:06:18] problem." Everybody thinking real deep
[1:06:20] about your life's problems
[1:06:22] now. Everybody thinking real deep about
[1:06:25] the giants in your life, church, you've
[1:06:27] got the sword.
[1:06:29] You've got the word of God.
[1:06:32] David had the sword of the enemy. He
[1:06:35] conquered the enemy. Jesus has the power
[1:06:38] over death. Jesus has the power over the
[1:06:41] grave. Jesus has power over hell. And
[1:06:44] then he gives you a sword. Praise God.
[1:06:48] You're one of his mighty men or sisters,
[1:06:50] whatever you want, however it makes
[1:06:51] sense for you. Praise God.
[1:06:57] Hebrews
[1:06:58] 2:15. So see that Hebrews 2:15. I'm
[1:07:02] saying today that by the resurrection,
[1:07:04] Jesus has raised with the sword, the
[1:07:07] power over death. And he's given you the
[1:07:10] sword of the spirit. And you've got to
[1:07:12] use the sword. Praise
[1:07:14] God. Hebrews 2:15. And deliver them who
[1:07:18] through fear of death were all their
[1:07:20] lifetimes subject to bondage. So what
[1:07:23] did Jesus do? He delivered the fearful.
[1:07:25] What does Jesus want to do for you?
[1:07:26] Deliver you from your fears.
[1:07:29] Hallelujah. Now, many times it's
[1:07:31] personal. We don't like sharing it. But
[1:07:32] one thing's for sure, you got to share
[1:07:34] with Jesus. You don't have to share your
[1:07:36] fears with me or anybody else unless you
[1:07:38] want to. Sometimes that helps. The Bible
[1:07:39] said, "Confess your faults one to
[1:07:41] another and you'll be healed." Sometimes
[1:07:42] you have to confess your sins, but the
[1:07:44] main person to tell is the Lord Jesus
[1:07:46] Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] He's the one that you have to
[1:07:51] tell. Now, let me just just finish with
[1:07:54] this here.
[1:07:55] So after David got through the period of
[1:07:57] humiliation, then he became king over
[1:08:00] Hebron, just Hebron for seven
[1:08:02] years. But then after that, he became
[1:08:05] kingdom. I'm sorry, he became ruler over
[1:08:07] all 12
[1:08:09] tribes. And then what did he do? He
[1:08:11] built the tabernacle. And then after his
[1:08:13] ministry, Solomon came in. What does
[1:08:16] Hebron represent? Hebron represents when
[1:08:19] Jesus first started reigning over the
[1:08:21] Jews, right, with the Holy Ghost. And
[1:08:24] then they had to take it to all nations.
[1:08:27] And church, this is still going on
[1:08:28] today. And the church said, "You are a
[1:08:30] part of that." Praise God. 20 years ago,
[1:08:34] there was no church, message church here
[1:08:36] in Akran. Brother Chris, there was no
[1:08:37] message church. The kingdom, glory, the
[1:08:40] kingdom had not come to Akran. Ah, but
[1:08:42] the kingdom of God, the baptism of the
[1:08:44] Holy Ghost has now come to Akran. Praise
[1:08:47] God. And now people can overcome their
[1:08:50] sins. We've seen the families, right?
[1:08:52] The Yang family. We've seen these
[1:08:53] families, the Sarpong family, now the
[1:08:55] Smith family, different families come
[1:08:57] through and when they receive the
[1:08:58] kingdom of God, now the kingdom of God
[1:09:00] comes into their homes. It comes into
[1:09:02] their church. It comes into their city.
[1:09:04] The kingdom of God is still being built
[1:09:06] and Jesus Christ is the builder of the
[1:09:08] kingdom. Praise God. He wants to build a
[1:09:11] kingdom in your life, Brother Chris.
[1:09:12] Hallelujah, brother Nia. He wants to
[1:09:14] build the kingdom of God in your life.
[1:09:16] Praise God. In my life. Hallelujah.
[1:09:20] It's still going because no man knows
[1:09:22] the day or the hour he wants to build it
[1:09:24] in your family, in my family. Praise
[1:09:27] God.
[1:09:29] Until uh the the the Bible said till the
[1:09:32] to the ends of the earth, the Bible says
[1:09:34] in Acts chapter
[1:09:36] 2, to you your children, them that are
[1:09:39] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[1:09:41] God shall call. I'm so glad he called my
[1:09:44] name, church.
[1:09:47] And then after he finishes the the
[1:09:49] kingdom, after Jesus finishes the
[1:09:52] gentile kingdom, what comes in? The
[1:09:54] millennium. How many appreciate that? By
[1:09:55] God's grace. That came to me while I was
[1:09:57] driving home yesterday. So, I was using
[1:09:59] my voice message to record it. I
[1:10:00] thought, why I want to preach that
[1:10:02] tomorrow? Praise God. I'd never seen it
[1:10:04] like that before. Because my my main
[1:10:06] question was, Jose, why did David take
[1:10:09] Goliath's sword? What did that
[1:10:10] represent? It represents Jesus. Now,
[1:10:12] he's got the keys of death and hell.
[1:10:15] I've got the I got the I got the weapon
[1:10:17] of the enemy. Now I'm using it.
[1:10:20] Hallelujah. Now I can open and close.
[1:10:23] Hallelujah. I can open the victory. I
[1:10:26] can close. I can stop the devil. I have
[1:10:28] power to open and shut. The Bible says
[1:10:31] what Jesus opens no man can shut. What
[1:10:33] Jesus shuts no man will open. Praise
[1:10:36] God.
[1:10:37] Like brother Chris testified that job.
[1:10:39] See God opened up that job. No man can
[1:10:41] shut it because God opened it up.
[1:10:44] Hallelujah. Jesus is the one who opens
[1:10:47] every door in our lives. Praise God.
[1:10:51] All
[1:10:52] right. Now, what am I trying to get
[1:10:54] down? I'm got trying to get down to
[1:10:55] this. After David defeated the giant,
[1:10:59] that wasn't the end of the giants. There
[1:11:01] were still four more giants that had to
[1:11:03] fall. And David killed none of them. In
[1:11:07] other words, Jesus didn't kill all the
[1:11:09] giants. He killed the biggest one, the
[1:11:11] daddy of them all. All right. But then
[1:11:15] other men and women were raised up to go
[1:11:18] be giant killers. Remember two years
[1:11:20] ago, I preached that sermon. Uh we're
[1:11:22] not all called to be giant killers,
[1:11:25] right? Not everybody was a giant killer,
[1:11:28] but there'll be some who take the sword
[1:11:30] of the word and they slay giants with
[1:11:33] it.
[1:11:35] Ishbib
[1:11:38] Enab, I'm sorry. Yeah, the the giant
[1:11:40] Ishbin Binab was the son of the giant
[1:11:43] Goliath. He had a spear that weighed 300
[1:11:46] shekels of
[1:11:47] brass. And Abashai, the son of Zariah,
[1:11:50] slew him in 2 Samuel
[1:11:53] 21:16-7. No matter how big the struggle
[1:11:56] looks, no matter how great the giant
[1:11:58] looks, God's people are giant killers.
[1:12:01] Praise God. Because we've got the sword.
[1:12:04] We've got the power. Jesus can open the
[1:12:07] victory for us to get victory over the
[1:12:09] giants in our lives.
[1:12:13] Hallelujah. The next giant was called
[1:12:16] Saf or Sepi, whichever, whether you read
[1:12:20] Samuel or 1 Chronicles. This was another
[1:12:22] son of the
[1:12:23] giant, and he was slain by Sichi, the
[1:12:28] Hashite in 2 Samuel 21:18 and 1st
[1:12:31] Chronicles 20:4.
[1:12:33] So two other giants go down. A third
[1:12:36] giant named Lami, the brother of
[1:12:39] Goliath. So now his brother comes out.
[1:12:41] He had a spear like a weaver's beam. So
[1:12:44] this massive spear. But he was slain by
[1:12:46] Elhannan, the son of Jer in 2 Samuel
[1:12:52] 21:17. The Bible says, "No weapon that's
[1:12:55] formed against you will prosper." Praise
[1:12:58] God. Amen. Brother Chris, it didn't
[1:13:00] matter the enemy's weapons because they
[1:13:02] were on the wrong team.
[1:13:05] They're on the wrong side. God's
[1:13:07] victory, God's army is going to get the
[1:13:09] victory over the giants. Praise God. And
[1:13:12] that gives us hope. Any giant our life
[1:13:14] will fall the same way by the word of
[1:13:17] God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:19] That's
[1:13:21] right. And the last one is an unnamed
[1:13:23] giant. He had six fingers on each hand,
[1:13:27] six toes on each foot for 24 digits. And
[1:13:31] he defied
[1:13:32] Israel. So today, they defy Jesus
[1:13:35] Christ. So they defy the gospel. And
[1:13:37] who? Jonathan, the son of Shem, David's
[1:13:41] nephew. So even David's family is
[1:13:43] getting involved. And I got news for
[1:13:45] you. You're in the family of Jesus
[1:13:47] Christ.
[1:13:48] Right? Ephesians says that we uh uh that
[1:13:52] the uh that the family all family in
[1:13:55] heaven and earth is named the Lord Jesus
[1:13:57] Christ. So I could walk up to Malachi
[1:14:00] and Nia. I could say uh God bless you,
[1:14:03] Mrs. Jesus Christ, right? Because that
[1:14:06] that's your name. You're not Jesus
[1:14:09] Christ, but you're the bride of Jesus
[1:14:10] Christ. You're in the family of the Lord
[1:14:13] Jesus Christ. The Bible said we're all
[1:14:15] named the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:20] And we're given power over the giants in
[1:14:22] our lives.
[1:14:25] Hallelujah, church. I'm sure we all feel
[1:14:28] like what it's like to be
[1:14:29] intimidated,
[1:14:31] right? When I spar Malachi, I'm
[1:14:33] intimidated. I get nervous now. Not when
[1:14:37] he was eight, I didn't get intimidated
[1:14:38] enough, but now I get
[1:14:39] nervous. I just I just thought that
[1:14:42] one. But church, all these men could
[1:14:44] have been intimidated by the giant in
[1:14:46] front of them.
[1:14:48] And you're not a giant. You're just
[1:14:50] bigger than me. I'm not using them in a
[1:14:51] bad way, a good
[1:14:54] way. We all have to face times where by
[1:14:57] we're intimidated by the situations of
[1:15:00] life, the scenes of life we get
[1:15:02] intimidated by. But there's always a
[1:15:04] solution. There's always an open door
[1:15:07] because Jesus has already conquered
[1:15:09] death and hell.
[1:15:12] He's already conquered any spiritual
[1:15:13] death that would try to come upon your
[1:15:15] life, any intimidation, any spirit that
[1:15:18] would try to overcome you. He's already
[1:15:21] defeated the father of all of them.
[1:15:24] Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] And he said, "Because I live, you shall
[1:15:28] live also."
[1:15:30] Because I overcame, you shall overcome.
[1:15:32] The Bible says, what is our victory?
[1:15:34] Even our faith in the word of God. our
[1:15:37] faith in Jesus Christ. That's right.
[1:15:41] Brother Ram quotes, and I found this
[1:15:43] really good. Brother Ram quotes
[1:15:44] Revelation 11:17 to 18. That was my
[1:15:47] text. He quotes in the church age book.
[1:15:49] And what does he say? He says, "Don't
[1:15:51] fear, John. Don't fear, little flock."
[1:15:54] Everyone say, "Don't fear." Ready? Don't
[1:15:56] fear. Don't fear. Brother said, "This is
[1:15:59] what Jesus is saying to the little
[1:16:00] flock. Don't fear little
[1:16:02] flock. All that I am, you are heir
[1:16:05] to." Right? Doesn't the Bible say he's
[1:16:08] going to share his Doesn't the Bible say
[1:16:09] we have an eternal inheritance? We have
[1:16:11] mansions. Right? Jesus is going to
[1:16:14] prepare a place for us. We have a
[1:16:16] mansion in heaven. All that I have,
[1:16:18] you're heir of eternal life. And I've
[1:16:19] got if I've got Jesus, I got it all. Ah,
[1:16:22] there's a good vindication by God's
[1:16:24] grace. All my power is
[1:16:27] yours. My omnipotence is yours as I
[1:16:30] stand in your midst. In other words, the
[1:16:32] the wisdom of God, the power of God is
[1:16:34] in the word. I've not come to bring fear
[1:16:37] and failure, but love and courage and
[1:16:40] ability. I'm going to read that again.
[1:16:42] I've not come to bring fear and
[1:16:45] failure. Jesus did not come Jesus did
[1:16:48] not save you and I to bring us fear or a
[1:16:52] failed life.
[1:16:54] That's one thing I don't want. I don't
[1:16:55] want to fail Jesus.
[1:16:58] I want to please him. I want to serve
[1:17:00] his purpose in my life. I want to see
[1:17:03] the the the Holy Ghost get total victory
[1:17:06] in my life.
[1:17:08] I didn't come to bring you fear and
[1:17:10] failure. But I came to bring you power,
[1:17:13] courage, and
[1:17:14] ability. Church, don't look at your
[1:17:16] flesh. Your flesh is never going to have
[1:17:18] the ability. It's the power of God. It's
[1:17:21] the spirit of God in us that gives us
[1:17:22] the ability.
[1:17:24] That's what he come to do. And so today,
[1:17:26] as we close, if you need the ability,
[1:17:28] let's ask him for it. Amen. Jesus said,
[1:17:32] "Ask and you shall what?" He said, "Seek
[1:17:34] and you shall." He said, "Knock and it
[1:17:37] shall be." You know why? Could it be
[1:17:39] open? Because he has the key.
[1:17:41] And the Bible even calls knowledge, the
[1:17:43] key of knowledge. Maybe maybe church,
[1:17:45] there's there's a scripture you need
[1:17:46] that will unlock some knowledge for you
[1:17:48] to
[1:17:50] overcome. God has the key.
[1:17:54] Hallelujah. Just as Brother Rod handed
[1:17:56] me the keys to the car yesterday, now I
[1:17:57] got an old car for Lydia. Jesus Christ
[1:18:01] can hand you the keys to your victory
[1:18:03] today. And guess where it's going to be?
[1:18:06] I got a nice key box right here where
[1:18:09] Jesus keeps all of his keys. You just
[1:18:11] got to look inside here, find your key
[1:18:14] because it unlocks every promise of
[1:18:17] God. He says, "All power is given unto
[1:18:20] me." Jesus said, "And it's yours to use.
[1:18:23] You speak the word and I'll perform it.
[1:18:26] That is my covenant and it can never
[1:18:28] fail.
[1:18:30] Church, if you and I speak the word of
[1:18:31] God, God has to back it up. I'm talking
[1:18:35] about when it's God's will. I'm not
[1:18:36] talking about like if you want this or
[1:18:38] that or I'm talking about when it's
[1:18:39] God's will and you want victory over sin
[1:18:41] in your life. That's God's will
[1:18:43] undoubtedly for you and I. And we speak
[1:18:46] the word of God and God will perform it.
[1:18:48] That word can never fail.
[1:18:52] All right. In closing
[1:18:55] now, Quesa, put up Mark 9. I've used
[1:18:58] this many times before, I think, but put
[1:19:00] up Mark 9:25. I want to keep using it
[1:19:02] because I want to show you the power in
[1:19:04] the
[1:19:13] word. Mark 9:25. Here's a man that was
[1:19:17] had a foul
[1:19:19] spirit. And church, we know so many
[1:19:21] people today are possessed with foul
[1:19:23] spirits. But look what Jesus says to
[1:19:26] this spirit. Look what he says. He says,
[1:19:28] "Thou deaf and dumb spirit, I charge
[1:19:30] thee. Come out of him and enter no more
[1:19:33] into him." That's quite a thing to cast
[1:19:35] out a devil. But it's another thing to
[1:19:38] say, "You'll not come in again." But we
[1:19:40] know the scripture. He's going to go get
[1:19:42] seven more and eight are coming back. So
[1:19:45] what does Jesus give him? Jesus gives
[1:19:46] him a promise. Although eight come back,
[1:19:48] I'll say like this. Although 80 demons
[1:19:50] come back, he's never getting back in.
[1:19:52] Praise God. Why? Because Jesus has the
[1:19:55] keys to the door. Praise God. Jesus has
[1:19:57] keys to death and hell, and he gives you
[1:20:00] the power. Praise God. Amen.
[1:20:03] What a promise. As I've told you before,
[1:20:05] I've spoken the word of God against all
[1:20:07] my past
[1:20:08] addictions, right? I'll never chew
[1:20:10] tobacco again. I'll never drink alcohol
[1:20:13] like that again. I'll never buy those
[1:20:15] type of magazines again. I'll never
[1:20:16] spend my Sundays in front of the uh TV
[1:20:19] like that again. All my addictions, the
[1:20:21] hatred for my father, I'll never let
[1:20:23] that hatred overtake me again. And
[1:20:25] church, God's word is performed. God's
[1:20:27] given me the ability. God's given me the
[1:20:30] power. God's given me the courage. It's
[1:20:32] never come back upon me again by the
[1:20:35] grace of God because it's the power of
[1:20:38] God. It's the It's the will of God. It's
[1:20:40] the covenant of God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:20:44] It's a covenant. Praise God. That we
[1:20:47] have the power of the spoken word to
[1:20:50] speak the word of God. And if we speak
[1:20:53] God's word, it is powerful. It cannot be
[1:20:57] defeated. Life is greater than death.
[1:21:01] Hallelujah.
[1:21:03] You can slay the giant in your life
[1:21:05] today because Jesus slew the father of
[1:21:09] giants. The father of lies. Amen. The
[1:21:12] murder from the beginning. Jesus
[1:21:14] defeated Satan on Calvary. And
[1:21:16] therefore, we can speak the word. And it
[1:21:19] comes out of our lips. If we believe it,
[1:21:21] it has to happen. Let's stand. Mighty
[1:21:25] men and women of God, musicians can
[1:21:33] come. Thank you,
[1:21:36] Jesus, that you have the keys of death
[1:21:38] and
[1:21:40] hell. Praise
[1:21:43] God. So, I imagine this last 30 minutes,
[1:21:46] everyone's been thinking about the giant
[1:21:48] you're facing.
[1:21:50] I hope you have been. Or if all the
[1:21:53] giants are slain, praise God, let's
[1:21:55] fight for somebody else.
[1:21:57] Hallelujah. Let's fight for somebody
[1:21:59] else. Now, church, who has the keys?
[1:22:02] Jesus has the
[1:22:04] keys. Where are his keys? His keys are
[1:22:06] the word of
[1:22:07] God. The keys, the word of God unlocks
[1:22:11] every door. Hallelujah.
[1:22:14] The key of knowledge unlocks the door to
[1:22:17] salvation, the door to holiness, the
[1:22:19] door to the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:21] The keys of God unlock every
[1:22:23] door. Glory to
[1:22:27] God. Let's bow our hearts
[1:22:33] here. Dear Jesus, we thank you, Lord,
[1:22:35] for the word that we've heard today. You
[1:22:37] have
[1:22:39] power over death and hell, Lord, as we
[1:22:42] read here today.
[1:22:44] And your prophet picks this up and say
[1:22:46] tells us do not fear. You speak the
[1:22:49] word, I'll perform
[1:22:51] it. Lord, we saw how you overcame. You
[1:22:54] prayed about it for a long extended of
[1:22:57] time. You prayed for an
[1:23:00] hour and you got the victory over
[1:23:02] physical
[1:23:05] pain. Humiliation,
[1:23:09] rejection, every demon power that came
[1:23:12] upon you to tempt you. You got the
[1:23:14] victory over everyone through the power
[1:23:16] of prayer, the power of the
[1:23:21] word. Lord
[1:23:23] Jesus, these are your
[1:23:26] people. Lord, we've seen you slay the
[1:23:30] giant of death and hell on the cross.
[1:23:33] You went down even down to hell and took
[1:23:35] the keys of death and hell. You took
[1:23:38] Goliath's
[1:23:40] sword because you got the key of
[1:23:44] death. And Lord, you give us the keys as
[1:23:46] you told Peter. And to you I give you
[1:23:48] the keys to the
[1:23:53] kingdom. Lord, we're told that there's
[1:23:55] no weapon that's formed against us shall
[1:23:57] prosper. Lord
[1:23:58] God, we're told when the enemy comes in
[1:24:00] like a flood, the spirit of God will
[1:24:02] raise up a standard against
[1:24:05] it. That means the rally around the
[1:24:08] flag, the banner, the army of Jesus
[1:24:12] Christ. We thank you today for your
[1:24:15] word, Lord. Thank you for the strength
[1:24:17] to preach, the strength to sing, Lord.
[1:24:19] Thank you for the attentiveness of the
[1:24:21] saints, Lord. I look at their faces. I
[1:24:24] believe they're sincere, Lord God, as
[1:24:26] I've done my best to be sincere, Lord
[1:24:28] God, so that victories can happen in the
[1:24:30] lives of the believers, Lord God. That
[1:24:33] this resurrection day would be a
[1:24:34] memorable day, Lord, because the power
[1:24:36] of God is here. The keys are here.
[1:24:42] Hallelujah. And the Holy Spirit can say,
[1:24:45] "Evil spirit, get behind me. You'll
[1:24:47] enter no more into me."
[1:24:50] by the grace of Jesus Christ, by the
[1:24:52] power and the authority of Jesus
[1:24:56] Christ. Thank you, Lord. Lord, as we
[1:24:59] were praying yesterday, Lord, we pray
[1:25:00] for revival in the church.
[1:25:02] Lord, as I told Sister Zerb right out
[1:25:05] there by my children, Lord, if you do
[1:25:07] some revival, some supernatural thing,
[1:25:08] then we'll know you want us to do a
[1:25:10] season of prayer meetings, Lord
[1:25:13] God.
[1:25:15] Hallelujah. Lord God, have your way
[1:25:17] today, Lord God. Let each and every
[1:25:20] mighty man and
[1:25:21] woman remember that our captain, the
[1:25:24] Lord Jesus Christ, defeated the greatest
[1:25:27] giant. And all giants can be slain by
[1:25:30] the power of the word. For the word of
[1:25:33] God is sharp, more powerful than a
[1:25:34] two-edged sword, dividing us under soul,
[1:25:38] body, spirit, joints of the marrow.
[1:25:40] Hallelujah Jesus. Grant it. Lord God, I
[1:25:42] pray for the victory of the people
