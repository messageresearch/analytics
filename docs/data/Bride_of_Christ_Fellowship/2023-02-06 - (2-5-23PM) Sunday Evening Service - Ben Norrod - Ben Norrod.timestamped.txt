[24:54] fellowship and just being able to got to
[24:58] jam with my buddy and and play some
[25:01] music this afternoon and if you know
[25:03] anything about me at all you know that
[25:05] I'd be sitting there like that 12 hours
[25:07] later just like that I'm not moving I I
[25:09] like that I told somebody one time if I
[25:12] could just do the music thing and quit
[25:13] the preaching thing I'd do that thing
[25:15] and not that thing amen I I like it I
[25:18] enjoy it and we so appreciate the Lord
[25:21] now I I sang everything I'm going to
[25:24] sing to you this morning we're going to
[25:26] get into the word of the Lord right away
[25:27] all right Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 I
[25:31] know that it's getting uh late in the
[25:33] evening and I know many of you are going
[25:36] to be traveling home trying to get back
[25:37] in the bed get rested up for work and
[25:40] for school or whatever else you got
[25:42] facing you and so I'm going to try my
[25:45] best not to be too lengthy let's see 10
[25:46] before I promise to get you out of here
[25:48] no later than 8 30. I promise that'll be
[25:51] amen that'll be be my word to you
[25:55] amen and I'm not even careful talking
[25:58] that way because I've seen the Holy
[26:00] Ghost come down make that happen just
[26:01] that way amen people sit Spellbound for
[26:04] hours at a time I sure see the Lord do
[26:06] that amen but you know we try our best
[26:09] to be mindful of everything that we're
[26:11] facing and time is honest whether we
[26:14] like it or not time is tearing us right
[26:15] in the face but appreciate you folks
[26:18] appreciate everything about you and love
[26:21] your spirit your Christian spirit and I
[26:23] love your fellowship and and you know
[26:26] just appreciate the Lord and we're
[26:28] certainly going to be continuing to pray
[26:30] for you all and you all continue to pray
[26:31] for us and thank you for all the
[26:35] hospitality and so Ephesians chapter 5
[26:37] verse 22 23 and 24. uh the Lord willing
[26:43] tonight I want to speak to you upon the
[26:45] ministry of surrender
[26:47] the ministry of surrenders how I want to
[26:50] title this and I I know now you married
[26:52] women you've done now you think you're
[26:54] going to get it now right now is the
[26:56] time you know I I I promise you I'm not
[26:59] going to use this scripture to hit on
[27:00] the married women and and Bash at them
[27:02] and whatever more you're not in trouble
[27:04] tonight I promise we're going to use
[27:06] this as a parallel to some spiritual
[27:08] things and I think brother Brown did
[27:10] that himself whenever he preached the
[27:12] visible Union of the Bride he went to
[27:13] Romans 7 and he brought it back in how
[27:16] that
[27:17] seemingly he said Paul speaking marriage
[27:19] and divorce he said but this is a
[27:21] spiritual thing that he wanted to talk
[27:22] about between Christ and the bride well
[27:24] that's that's what I've got on my mind
[27:25] tonight too Ephesians 5 verse 22.
[27:29] it says wives submit yourselves under
[27:32] your own husbands as unto the Lord
[27:35] the husband is the head of the wife even
[27:37] as Christ is the head of the church
[27:39] and he is the savior of the body
[27:42] therefore as the church is subject unto
[27:45] Christ
[27:46] so let the wives be to their own
[27:49] husbands in everything you know I like
[27:52] the way the Bible does things
[27:54] and the way God allowed scripture to be
[27:57] wrote I like the way that it shows did
[27:59] you notice Paul's saying your own
[28:01] husband's in there
[28:02] and you know that kind of knocks in this
[28:04] whole commune cultists you know every
[28:08] man bosses the women around and this
[28:10] kind of thing you know this really kind
[28:12] of shows you exactly how that God wanted
[28:14] things to be done and uh not you know
[28:17] one man boss and all the women around
[28:19] and stuff like that but let every woman
[28:21] unto her own her own husband and the
[28:25] spiritual type to that is is that God
[28:26] don't want 48 men trying to tell the
[28:29] bride what to do he's the boss he wants
[28:31] her to be subject unto him not 12
[28:34] different denominations and 14 different
[28:36] this that and the others amen but unto
[28:38] him alone shall she keep I like that
[28:41] amen now I want to read to you the Lord
[28:44] we will end here out of a message called
[28:46] Jehovah Jireh and uh the Bible said that
[28:50] we're to be submissive and to subject
[28:53] ourselves and then brother Bram says
[28:54] that it's a woman's nature he says the
[28:57] nature of a woman to surrender to a man
[28:59] the nature of the church he said is to
[29:02] surrender to Christ surrender to his
[29:04] will Just Surrender she has no thinking
[29:08] of her own she takes his word not
[29:11] somebody else's
[29:12] and he says that if Eve would have done
[29:14] that very thing said we would have never
[29:16] had to die but she listened to reasoning
[29:19] but the real bride of Christ takes the
[29:22] headship of Christ the word and only
[29:25] believes God's word that's the real
[29:27] restored bride he says hallelujah amen
[29:31] let's pray together with the word while
[29:33] your heads are bowed this evening if
[29:34] you'd have a need in your heart
[29:36] something you'd like to be remembered in
[29:37] prayer would you just raise your hand to
[29:39] the Lord amen my hands up too
[29:42] Lord Jesus we are so grateful for the
[29:45] opportunity to come into this place Lord
[29:47] which is called thy house Lord really
[29:50] this room in the building that we're in
[29:53] could be used for any purpose but father
[29:55] it's been dedicated to the service of
[29:57] God and dedicated to the joyous
[30:00] rejoicing in the happiness of the Saints
[30:03] and for the prayers and the tears and
[30:05] the supplications of those Believers
[30:06] calling upon thy name
[30:08] and fathers we come into this place
[30:10] today we're asking that the Holy Ghost
[30:12] will not only take his word and speak to
[30:15] us by that word but Lord that you will
[30:17] also Grant to us the favor and the
[30:19] strength to be able to do and deliver
[30:21] what we need to do and say what needs to
[30:23] be said and father give us the strength
[30:26] to receive it as your children and I
[30:27] pray tonight Lord every evil thing will
[30:30] stand at Bay while we worship and
[30:32] receive from you and may the power of
[30:35] the Holy Ghost I pray just come down now
[30:37] take your word bless every life bless
[30:40] every uplifted hand may you not forget
[30:42] Lord that which is underneath each hand
[30:44] as we commit it to you for the glory of
[30:46] God in the name of Jesus we surrender it
[30:48] amen and amen and the Saints said amen
[30:51] and you may be seated and I said that
[30:53] out of habits you all had a good amen
[30:55] out therefore I could get it amen I like
[30:57] that that was good amen and you're a
[31:01] good church for that I promise you know
[31:02] not to not having to pull too much on
[31:04] that part I like that
[31:07] some Churches I feel like I I say come
[31:10] on say a man more than I actually preach
[31:11] amen try to get them to get in the
[31:14] rhythm of something you know and and uh
[31:16] and people that get mad at you about
[31:17] that oh you shouldn't pull on people you
[31:20] should pull on them in a congregation
[31:21] well I when you go to a basketball game
[31:24] that's what they got some cheerleaders
[31:25] in that band out there for us to get you
[31:27] into Rhythm or the spirit of something
[31:28] amen and uh when they're playing them
[31:31] old fight songs
[31:33] and then to get your hands are clapping
[31:35] you know and doing all that kind of
[31:36] stuff they're trying to get you in the
[31:37] Rhythm and the spirit of the of the game
[31:39] the football or whatever it might be
[31:41] that you're watching or playing and uh
[31:43] we sing and worship and say amen and
[31:45] praise the Lord and clap our hands and
[31:48] maybe even do a little dancing that the
[31:49] spirit hits Us in the right way Amen to
[31:51] get into the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[31:52] I like that amen now I want to speak to
[31:56] you tonight the Lord Lord helping us now
[31:58] I promise I'm not going to hold you
[31:59] super long I know you've had a long day
[32:01] already and I preached a little over
[32:03] with all the singing and everything it
[32:04] takes it into overtime and I'm going to
[32:07] try to be very brief with this and get
[32:09] the main points across and uh you know
[32:12] if you didn't have a good pastor I'd be
[32:13] worried I'd just dig in take extra time
[32:15] and do this like can but you know you
[32:18] you got good teaching here and good
[32:20] instruction at the little home church
[32:21] and and uh we thank the Lord for that so
[32:24] it uh it actually makes an evangelist
[32:26] job very very easy when you got a good
[32:28] pastor to come and visit I like that and
[32:31] um we sure appreciate amen the word of
[32:33] God we appreciate what we're being able
[32:35] to read and study after and I hope that
[32:38] what I've got to say tonight I hope it
[32:40] drives right to the core right to your
[32:43] very Soul amen the importance of
[32:47] surrendering to God and I know that I've
[32:50] uh probably come by this way and preach
[32:53] things that are similar I've mentioned
[32:55] surrendering and different things and
[32:57] I'm sure you're a pastor and other
[32:59] brothers has come through here have
[33:00] talked about
[33:01] they've talked about you know the uh the
[33:04] benefits and the uh the necessity and so
[33:07] forth of surrendering to the Lord and uh
[33:10] so I'm not really going to say much to
[33:12] you I don't think that uh in the way of
[33:15] the text itself that's odd or different
[33:16] to you surely by now you understand
[33:19] fully what it means to be a surrendered
[33:22] Christian to the Lord but what I'm going
[33:24] to try to do is I'm going to try to fill
[33:26] in all them little nooks and crannies on
[33:28] the subject that maybe things you
[33:30] haven't thought of or things you haven't
[33:32] seen or thought of before I'm going to
[33:34] ask the Lord to help us to see those
[33:35] parts and bring a lot of benefit to
[33:38] hearing about the subject tonight
[33:39] because we we need to understand I
[33:43] believe this with all of my heart we
[33:45] need to understand how important it is
[33:47] to become a surrendered person to the
[33:50] Lord now now I'm saying that and in your
[33:52] mind you're a Manning man and you know
[33:55] but we have to understand the exchange
[33:57] of that first of all it's easier said
[34:00] than it is done
[34:02] and I can stand up and say all day and
[34:04] end up preaching consent and say serve
[34:06] the Lord surrender the Lord give
[34:08] yourself to the Lord you know what I
[34:10] found out in my years of traveling and
[34:11] service to the people of God I found out
[34:13] a lot of people can say it but they
[34:15] don't know how to do it they don't know
[34:17] what it looks like and this is where I
[34:19] think that good Bible teaching comes
[34:21] into play here and now you little
[34:24] kitties you wanted Bible study somebody
[34:25] mentioned it or not I'm going to give
[34:27] you a lot of scriptures to run through
[34:28] so you keep your Bibles ready and we're
[34:30] going to look at some things by the help
[34:32] of the Lord and when we look at these
[34:34] things God helping us now I want to be
[34:37] very clear to you and say that first and
[34:40] foremost and this is something if you're
[34:42] taking a note be sure to put this down
[34:44] remember that the bride I'm talking
[34:47] about the wife of God the elected of God
[34:49] is the only one that can fully surrender
[34:53] to God understand that right now just
[34:56] like in Acts 2 38 repent and be baptized
[34:59] in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[35:01] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[35:03] there's only one real genuine true group
[35:06] on this planet for the last six thousand
[35:08] years there's only been one little bride
[35:10] of Christ that's ever been able to make
[35:12] that scripture Fully live by full
[35:15] repentance and that is the Bride of
[35:17] Jesus Christ now you say but brother Ben
[35:19] people surrender and people repent and
[35:22] things of that nature I know they do I'm
[35:24] certainly not saying that they don't I
[35:26] know what brother Brandon preached in
[35:27] future home when he talked about people
[35:29] that'll go to a meeting repent
[35:31] experience great sanctification and
[35:33] justification and things but yet what
[35:36] I'm talking about is more than just
[35:38] coming to church and receiving enough of
[35:40] the spirit to live a little cleaner and
[35:42] a little nicer a little bit better I'm
[35:44] talking about fully completely
[35:46] surrendering to God now you say well is
[35:49] it important why well it's important
[35:52] because a man and I'm quoting to you now
[35:54] from the Patmos Vision a man or a woman
[35:57] that is fully surrendered to God brother
[35:59] man says a man that does it I'm I'm
[36:01] saying a woman as well that fully
[36:03] surrenders to God is omnipotent in other
[36:06] words all powerful completely powerful
[36:09] and can control any situation now
[36:12] nodding back to this morning you think
[36:14] well what's the benefit of preaching
[36:16] things like what you preached if I've
[36:18] got real power with God I should be able
[36:20] to create squirrels speak to storms give
[36:23] uh you know give people their children
[36:25] and all the things that brother Branham
[36:26] did when he was here and the third pool
[36:28] come to him the message opened up to him
[36:31] the power and the authority come on him
[36:32] and he done all kinds of great
[36:34] Supernatural things yes but before that
[36:37] took place before any squirrel was
[36:39] created before any storm was moved and
[36:41] before any child was caused to come to
[36:44] repentance Amen brother branham's real
[36:46] power came from the ability to return
[36:49] love for hate good for evil and not to
[36:52] return evil for evil that's real power
[36:55] with God if you want to have real power
[36:57] with God Amen don't seek all of the
[36:59] great Supernatural things out there that
[37:01] that moves mountains and things like
[37:03] that Amen Let the love of the Lord Jesus
[37:06] and the power of God help you love those
[37:09] that would kill you Amen in that day in
[37:11] Calvary the prophet of God sin amen that
[37:13] when a man a woman comes to the place to
[37:16] where they can love the married very
[37:18] person that's going to kill him or want
[37:19] to kill him or do harm to him he said
[37:21] you can love that person not a put on
[37:24] but really love him he said you are
[37:26] staring heaven in the face you are
[37:28] standing in the vestibule of Heaven amen
[37:30] it goes to show real power with God is
[37:34] more than Supernatural outworking
[37:36] healing for example we've used healing
[37:38] for many years to be a Vindication of
[37:40] somebody's Ministry or somebody's life
[37:43] and well if I can heal the sick then
[37:46] that proves I'm a servant of God but
[37:48] Jesus said in that day many would come
[37:50] and say I've even raised the Dead cast
[37:52] out devils and done all kinds of things
[37:54] that's Divine Healing amen and yet at
[37:56] the same time Jesus said but I never
[37:58] knew you I never had a relationship with
[38:01] you so see they can be surrendered to a
[38:04] certain degree
[38:06] you with me still all right you listen
[38:08] amen now listen a person can surrender a
[38:11] gift they can surrender a gift and be
[38:13] very effective with that gift a person
[38:15] can surrender uh their mind and the God
[38:18] use them in a way with their mind to be
[38:20] very scientific and come up with answers
[38:23] and cures and whatever for things a
[38:26] person can surrender their body and
[38:28] Achieve great things in the physical
[38:29] manner amen but a person a man that is
[38:33] fully surrendered to God ain't just
[38:35] surrendering a part of them amen are
[38:37] just a portion of them or the one that's
[38:39] just going to help them look big or help
[38:40] somebody else out of a jam or something
[38:43] like that amen the Holy Ghost and real
[38:45] surrender is not a fire escape come on
[38:47] somebody amen but it is power with God
[38:50] to surrender everything you are
[38:51] including those parts that you don't
[38:53] want to surrender
[38:55] I hope you realize that the ability to
[38:58] want to to surrender the things you
[39:00] don't want to surrender that's what
[39:02] we're talking about God the Rubber and
[39:04] the road meeting together
[39:05] amen when a person can surrender
[39:07] something they don't want that ain't no
[39:08] problem
[39:10] parts of you that you don't care whether
[39:11] it gets surrendered or not that's not
[39:13] real overcoming y'all look at me like
[39:15] the mule staring at the new gate come on
[39:17] now amen but it's imparts of you that
[39:20] you're not all that interested in
[39:21] surrendering things about you you like
[39:23] or parts about you that you enjoy things
[39:25] or some little thing that you do amen
[39:27] but we don't want to surrender that to
[39:29] the Lord because that's where the real
[39:31] battle comes in but God wants you to
[39:33] surrender Body Spirit Soul every part of
[39:37] you
[39:37] every part of you exactly right now turn
[39:40] me to First Peter chapter 5.
[39:43] amen chapter 5 verse 5.
[39:50] but let's take for just a little bit
[39:52] Peter's words about surrender and
[39:54] submission
[39:56] and I'm going to say something to you
[39:57] and I hope you understand this real
[39:59] Christians are the only ones that know
[40:00] how to do this what I'm talking about
[40:02] real Christians now everybody else
[40:04] they're put on like they can
[40:06] you know you take a person that was
[40:07] raised and maybe a oh I don't know maybe
[40:09] the military or something like that and
[40:11] they learn how to be submissive and be
[40:12] obedient
[40:13] but obedience is not training
[40:17] obedience is not learning how to do
[40:19] something obedience is an act that comes
[40:22] from the heart
[40:24] to where you say to God even though I
[40:26] don't know how to do it I still want to
[40:28] I still want to do it that's real
[40:30] surrender and submission to God
[40:32] now looking at Peter's words here now
[40:35] watch he said likewise you're younger
[40:37] submit yourself unto the Elder yay all
[40:41] of you be subject one to another
[40:44] and be clothed with humility
[40:47] for God resists of the proud
[40:51] and gives grace to the humble
[40:53] so humble yourselves therefore unto the
[40:56] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[40:59] in due time I want you to think about
[41:01] these words for a moment
[41:03] you know we get this idea a lot of times
[41:06] that people are supposed to be
[41:08] surrendered to just the Elder of the
[41:10] church that's true
[41:11] but you see Peter didn't just identify
[41:14] to be surrendered to just the Elder of
[41:16] the church but he said you all be
[41:19] subject one to another
[41:22] oh Hallelujah
[41:24] here's where the grass gets a little
[41:26] taller huh
[41:27] because then we go to thinking well you
[41:29] know and maybe not in this little Church
[41:30] of course but you know most of your home
[41:33] folks or family put together and and uh
[41:35] you know and you become friends and
[41:37] acquaintances and what more and you love
[41:39] the Lord and I don't expect you to have
[41:41] issues and things with one another but
[41:43] you know people they they have a problem
[41:45] being surrendered to somebody else
[41:49] has taught us and trained us to think in
[41:53] a manner of I do for me I don't do for
[41:56] you
[41:57] that is his anti-god and anti-christian
[42:00] as it can get
[42:01] amen amen well not too many amens on
[42:04] that but that is true anyhow
[42:06] right and that's the facts of it whether
[42:08] the world or Society or whatever tells
[42:11] us you better get chose because if you
[42:14] don't somebody's going to take it from
[42:15] you
[42:16] they can say that but when a Christian
[42:18] is is demanded by someone to they take
[42:22] something from you listen Jesus's words
[42:24] are still just as true as what we read
[42:26] this morning when he said if somebody
[42:28] steals your coat give them your cloak
[42:30] also
[42:32] the purpose of them scriptures is not to
[42:34] become pushovers to let people just run
[42:37] over us and do anything they want to but
[42:39] the purpose of that scripture is to tell
[42:41] us and instruct us not to get caught up
[42:44] in trying to be your own advocate
[42:47] amen why in the world would I want to
[42:49] advocate for myself when he is promised
[42:52] to be my advocator
[42:54] remember the Holy Ghost series brother
[42:55] Robin said that he is not only our our
[42:58] comforter and he's not only our forgiver
[43:00] and whatever more but he's also the
[43:02] advocates
[43:03] he speaks on our behalf
[43:06] I feel sorry for some of these people
[43:07] that will bash and fight against
[43:10] Ministry
[43:11] you know you take brother Jesse's
[43:13] broadcast on YouTube
[43:15] you know and and no doubt I'm sure as as
[43:18] I've experienced traveling like this you
[43:21] know you'll you'll find a Critic
[43:23] everywhere you turn around
[43:25] that you know people should be careful
[43:28] they should be careful when they start
[43:30] speaking to men anointed by the Holy
[43:33] Ghost led by the Lord to do things
[43:36] they shouldn't jump on the preacher for
[43:38] every little detail
[43:40] they shouldn't whisper behind the
[43:42] pastor's back about every decision he's
[43:44] made
[43:46] sure that's good amens keep them coming
[43:48] now let's get it out where it belongs
[43:50] neither should you do that one to
[43:52] another
[43:54] it shouldn't be that way for the saints
[43:56] of God everyone should be subject one to
[43:58] another one Believers should not be
[44:01] against believer and at each other's
[44:02] throat and all these kind of things like
[44:04] that all of that should be put away from
[44:07] us
[44:08] that there be no Schism in the body of
[44:10] Christ
[44:11] you see people can get attitudes well
[44:13] you know you're not the pastor well so
[44:15] what
[44:16] well you're not the song leader so what
[44:19] do I look down at my little toe and say
[44:21] well you're not an ear stupid thing
[44:24] no it's a part of me I want him right
[44:26] where he's at
[44:28] right and if I had to lose my toe I'd be
[44:30] mad about it I'd be upset about it hurt
[44:32] about it I'd feel weird and strange
[44:34] looking at my foot and see no toe there
[44:37] come on somebody
[44:38] we should feel the same way about one
[44:40] another that we should be so knit
[44:42] together in the love of God that we
[44:44] should long to have that kind of
[44:47] Fellowship one with another
[44:49] I don't mean you lay on the phone with
[44:51] one another and talk about all the
[44:52] latest happenings but you are bound
[44:54] together in love if something happens to
[44:56] that person though they might be living
[44:58] their own life in their own private way
[45:00] with their own autonomy yet you're still
[45:02] in the corner and in their Corner if
[45:04] they need help you'll be right there for
[45:06] them
[45:08] sure I think sometimes love in church is
[45:11] what we call Loving churches they think
[45:12] that means everybody getting together
[45:14] and going fishing all the time
[45:16] you know our sister's going out and
[45:18] doing certain things or whatever they
[45:20] might do
[45:21] amen I believe in Fellowship but
[45:22] Fellowship ain't always a sign
[45:25] that everybody's knit together in the
[45:27] love of God how do you know a church is
[45:30] going through the thing together
[45:32] whenever persecution strikes that little
[45:34] body brother Adam said it like this in
[45:37] the word of the church he said you just
[45:38] cling that much closer together
[45:40] right in other words have each other's
[45:42] back
[45:43] submit yourself one to another
[45:46] you know people will sing songs and
[45:48] they'll do things and uh you know and
[45:51] and maybe read a poem or you know help
[45:53] take the offering or some kind of a
[45:55] testimony
[45:56] and people because of the status of what
[45:59] they're looking at will be a little bit
[46:00] critical of that
[46:02] who's that guy think he is
[46:04] standing up here talking about what the
[46:06] Lord's done for him what the Lord's done
[46:07] as much for me as he has for him good
[46:09] for you
[46:11] but the point of it is we should be knit
[46:13] together be willing
[46:15] to hear what the toe has got to say when
[46:17] the ear gets its turn it can talk
[46:21] amen that's right but be there for one
[46:24] another support one another
[46:26] hold each other up in prayer
[46:29] you know I'm not a very big Fellowship
[46:32] guy Jesse no I'm not on the phone all
[46:34] the time and you know I'm a lot like
[46:37] brother cam I guess in a lot of ways I
[46:38] got my little bunch and you know I stay
[46:40] kind of isolated sometimes really I have
[46:42] to almost
[46:44] Ministry and busyness and things you
[46:46] know it you try to make friends and then
[46:49] you know you can't keep up on calls and
[46:51] you can't keep up on contact and
[46:53] somebody gets their feelings hurting and
[46:54] I feel like a dog
[46:57] so sometimes I just try to do what I can
[46:59] to look for those quality moments to
[47:03] reach out and tell somebody I really
[47:05] love them
[47:06] it proves that it don't always have to
[47:08] be a constant 24-hour surveillance of
[47:12] somebody's life
[47:13] but just a word at the right time the
[47:16] Bible said it this way a word fitly
[47:18] spoken
[47:19] in other words a word in the right
[47:21] season
[47:22] and that's what Believers that support
[47:24] one another do they look for the right
[47:25] moment
[47:26] to speak in and say hey I just want you
[47:29] to know you mean something to me
[47:31] that's why we should take advantage of
[47:33] every opportunity we get like that
[47:36] why would brother banham think it's such
[47:38] a bad thing that people be upset each
[47:40] other in the Tabernacle this is in 1960.
[47:42] he said they'd see each other on the
[47:43] street turn their head and walk the
[47:45] other way
[47:46] he's a this is a Freewheel Army this is
[47:49] a volunteer army what's he care what
[47:51] they do
[47:52] what brother Ben I'm having a problem
[47:54] with people getting mad not speaking to
[47:56] each other in the church as long as
[47:57] they're behaving themselves let them do
[47:59] what they want to
[48:00] but see he knew the scripture like we've
[48:02] read tonight submit yourself one to
[48:05] another become one body one Mind One
[48:08] Soul
[48:09] and you see when people get that
[48:11] attitude you do your thing I'll do my
[48:12] thing they don't realize it but they're
[48:14] under the spirit of the hour
[48:16] and the spirit of the hour is to isolate
[48:19] Satan's great tactic is to isolate
[48:22] divide and conquer get you off by
[48:24] yourself then he starts filling you up
[48:26] with the ideas that you're alone and by
[48:28] yourself and nobody loves you
[48:31] right and excuse this for my blunt
[48:32] speaking but sometimes we're dumb enough
[48:34] to let the devil get away with that
[48:36] hello church Preach to me amen
[48:39] exactly right we're silly enough to let
[48:41] the devil get away with them things when
[48:43] we should be seizing opportunities to
[48:45] reach out at the right moment and say
[48:47] hey I just wanted to send you a card
[48:49] what's your address
[48:52] and maybe in that card you might say
[48:54] something like I just want you to know I
[48:56] appreciate your testimony before the
[48:58] Lord
[48:59] Little Things
[49:01] married men and women can tell you that
[49:03] one of the things that keeps a marriage
[49:05] thriving is them little things oh some
[49:08] of you unmarried kids and boys and girls
[49:10] and men and women or whoever you are you
[49:12] may think ah brother Ben that don't help
[49:15] nothing uh-huh wait till she steals
[49:17] every hairbrush you got and tell me it
[49:19] don't mean nothing
[49:22] I went mining the other day through the
[49:24] house little old bags and purses and
[49:27] things had been kind of cast off you
[49:29] know they buy 4 000 of them things they
[49:31] use two of them
[49:33] and I went mining through the the land
[49:35] the the the the the landfill of bags and
[49:39] things I found I found 13 brushes every
[49:42] one of them belong to me amen
[49:45] I've been telling people for years they
[49:46] steal my brushes amen and nobody
[49:48] believed me but I found 13 of them
[49:50] things in bags
[49:53] little things maybe it wouldn't be that
[49:55] big of a deal if we were facing death
[49:58] but when you're living life little
[50:00] things matter
[50:02] and everything has a season to it
[50:05] some people say ah it doesn't matter if
[50:07] we were dying what would it matter I'm
[50:09] not dying though
[50:11] I'm in good health by the grace of God
[50:13] I'm happy I'm living my life and little
[50:15] things matter to me while I'm not in a
[50:17] state of desperation
[50:20] when emergency strikes those other
[50:22] things take their priorities that really
[50:24] matter things that maybe would be super
[50:27] important would come to the Forefront
[50:29] whether a man's got a hairbrush or not
[50:31] ain't gonna matter if I was facing the
[50:33] last hours of my life
[50:35] but I'm not dying I'm not in a state of
[50:37] emergency
[50:39] and sometimes people think that the only
[50:41] time it can reach out to one another and
[50:43] have Fellowship one with another
[50:45] is when somebody gets into a state of an
[50:48] emergency
[50:49] but you know just a handshake after
[50:51] church and a hey I really appreciated
[50:54] what you had to say you know I like that
[50:56] skirt and of course this is a sister to
[50:58] a sister if any brother tries that I
[51:00] think maybe we're going to have a funny
[51:01] spirit amen
[51:04] but maybe a compliment a nice compliment
[51:07] a Godly well-placed compliment might do
[51:10] a lot for somebody you don't know what
[51:12] kind of mind battle they might have been
[51:13] in just that week
[51:16] but for some older sister perhaps to
[51:18] look at a younger one and say I love the
[51:20] way your dress looks I love that color I
[51:22] love those beads
[51:24] you know sometimes when I was a boy I
[51:26] think back to the times that I felt the
[51:29] most supported
[51:30] and it wasn't in the the big things like
[51:33] that but it's whatever uh brother
[51:35] Ledford many years ago my pastor he'd
[51:37] been gone a number of years from
[51:38] Middletown Ohio
[51:39] I'd come to church and I started taking
[51:41] an interest in church and I sort of
[51:44] wanted to dress up and I stole some of
[51:45] Daddy's ties
[51:47] I put a shirt on and a tie on I go to
[51:49] church
[51:50] no brother left for wouldn't say nothing
[51:52] all that much at all to me hardly ever
[51:54] but I just sitting in the restaurant
[51:55] he'd say Hey you look like a little
[51:57] Reverend preacher over there
[51:59] I wouldn't didn't even know I was called
[52:01] to preach at the time but many years
[52:02] later I thought about how that made me
[52:04] feel
[52:05] I felt special I felt important I felt
[52:08] like I belonged to the group
[52:10] is anybody hearing what I'm saying to
[52:11] you this is what Peter said submit
[52:14] yourself one to another
[52:17] when one cries we all cry when one
[52:20] rejoices we all Rejoice amen
[52:24] now notice that he tells us that God
[52:26] resists the proud
[52:30] first then Pride takes on a different
[52:32] shape sometimes than what we think he
[52:34] does
[52:35] pride and arrogance can come in many
[52:38] many many many different multi-colored
[52:40] forms
[52:42] sometimes somebody that's prideful
[52:45] and has a lot of Pride about him or her
[52:47] don't always act like or look like they
[52:50] got a lot of pride
[52:52] Sometimes they come across very subtle
[52:54] in other words
[52:55] I I've met people in Ministry that you
[52:58] try to explain things to
[53:01] hard to say a word they even act
[53:04] agreeable at times
[53:06] but six months later you can see a
[53:08] complete difference
[53:09] toward the negative than the positive
[53:11] why why they were listening to you
[53:14] smiling and saying okay uh-huh wow
[53:16] uh-huh deep in their heart they were
[53:19] saying why don't you just be quiet I'm
[53:21] going to do what I want to do anyways
[53:24] stubbornness can take on that kind of
[53:26] form
[53:27] Pride can look like just the attitude of
[53:30] I ain't doing it who Do You Think You
[53:32] Are
[53:33] sure
[53:35] Pride can look like that but Pride can
[53:37] also Veil itself in a religious form
[53:39] stay with me a little while
[53:42] amen not but two hours to go don't worry
[53:46] Pride can reveal itself in the way of
[53:49] sin God done this for me and I've done
[53:52] this for the Lord and I
[53:54] it's all right to say them things and
[53:56] testify it's all right to talk about
[53:58] what the Lord's done and what you've
[53:59] done for the Lord but remember you're
[54:01] not the only Pebble on the beach
[54:04] and when you get excited about what you
[54:06] testify about what God's done with you
[54:08] and you've done for God Amen you need to
[54:10] show double excitement when the other
[54:11] person starts telling us
[54:15] right makes a big difference in that big
[54:18] difference
[54:19] because whether we believe it's not
[54:20] people can tell when you don't jump up
[54:22] and down for them and you do for you
[54:25] you can't Bluff Humanity folks they'll
[54:28] know exactly what's going on and they
[54:29] know exactly how to take you
[54:31] when you go One Direction instead of the
[54:33] other now remember I'm not poking this
[54:35] at this church specifically this is
[54:37] generalized preaching now in general
[54:40] hey if the shoe fits where but otherwise
[54:42] I don't think there's any feet in here
[54:43] that need the shoe I'm just saying
[54:45] but if you do that's all right
[54:48] so submission comes from an attitude of
[54:52] all right if you're a part of the body
[54:53] of Christ
[54:55] then I am under obligation to you my
[54:57] brother you my sister are part of me
[55:01] and I've got to take concern for you
[55:04] even if I don't know you
[55:06] think about how many times you hear
[55:08] about little works of God and things
[55:09] going around and people having things
[55:11] and it comes public
[55:13] all of a sudden the Holy Spirit strikes
[55:16] maybe the pastor's heart to announce it
[55:18] to the church not only are you praying
[55:20] for them but perhaps maybe you get
[55:22] together and send cards out or you you
[55:24] go visit them or do some kind of a thing
[55:28] if you sat on taught long enough you
[55:29] might disagree on everything there is
[55:31] Under the Sun from politics to favorite
[55:33] color to favorite team
[55:37] but that's not what binds us together
[55:40] not the agreement of carnality
[55:43] but what binds us together is the
[55:45] submission to the Holy Ghost that's in
[55:47] you and that's in me that we are
[55:49] brothers and we are sisters serving in
[55:52] the same body
[55:54] it's like in the military you take a
[55:56] couple guys and set them down and talk
[55:57] them out they may not have a speck of
[55:59] things in common not a spec
[56:02] but when that drill sergeant hollers out
[56:04] there I attend
[56:05] every one of them soldiers white black
[56:07] red purple green tall fat skinny
[56:10] whatever they are they snap in order why
[56:12] they've been trained to stay together
[56:15] not to be divided oh Hallelujah there's
[56:19] a prophecy about that you know
[56:21] one day standing in an old shopping
[56:23] center the prophet looks out and sees a
[56:25] vision
[56:26] and there comes a little bride every one
[56:28] of them dressed in their National
[56:29] garment and they were ever won an order
[56:31] you say prophecy prophecy it speaks of
[56:35] one day there'll be a group on this
[56:37] Earth amen maybe those that have gone by
[56:39] the way of the Grave amen that will
[56:40] combine and merge together with us that
[56:43] are alive and remain but before this
[56:45] bride goes out of here in the Rapture
[56:47] she will be an army Walking In step with
[56:51] the word of God and with each other
[56:55] whether you know it or not I got to stay
[56:57] in my place or I either step on you or
[57:00] fall back on you
[57:03] so The rhythms Hallelujah have to be
[57:06] perfect praise God
[57:09] you got to know your place and stay
[57:11] there
[57:13] that's a hard thing
[57:15] well how am I supposed to know what God
[57:17] wants to do with me have you asked him
[57:21] have you went to him in prayer and say
[57:22] hey what do you want me to do
[57:25] because that's the answer to a lot of
[57:26] things you know
[57:29] notice again in the message called the
[57:30] meanest man
[57:32] what about speaking about Rebecca I said
[57:33] Rebecca come to meet Isaac said did you
[57:35] notice she failed her face
[57:38] he said they do it yet today
[57:40] you see the nature of a woman is to
[57:42] yield to that man
[57:43] and that's the reason the church should
[57:46] be veiled
[57:47] is because it's got a head that's Christ
[57:49] now compare that with what Peter said
[57:51] here that God resists the proud and
[57:54] gives grace to the humble and this
[57:57] humble
[57:58] is clothed with humility
[58:01] I like that
[58:04] so in other words when she veiled her
[58:07] face to meet him
[58:09] the veil he spoke of was humility
[58:14] you know people in in in the message
[58:17] especially to my opinion
[58:19] have this all kind of mixed up
[58:22] had a conversation with a brother some
[58:24] weeks ago about this very thing
[58:26] I was carrying on at the pulpit and
[58:28] talking about how you know man and woman
[58:30] get on each other and how they fight and
[58:32] argue and fuss and carry on and you know
[58:34] the angels in every Church they have
[58:36] they almost have heart failure when you
[58:37] talk this way but that's what marriage
[58:39] is made of
[58:41] some guy said to me one time my wife and
[58:43] I don't ever fight and I said you don't
[58:44] lie either do you
[58:48] everybody has fusses I don't care who
[58:50] you are
[58:53] and I was talking about how that you
[58:55] know sometimes
[58:56] my mind may be going a certain direction
[58:59] my wife would have a better idea of it
[59:01] than I would
[59:03] and feeling led to the Lord no doubt
[59:05] stop me in my tracks hey think this over
[59:10] this is what you probably should do
[59:12] I know there's a lot of men right now in
[59:15] the message if they're online right now
[59:16] they're falling out of their
[59:17] barcaloungers oh my God you listen to a
[59:19] woman
[59:20] sure I would
[59:22] if that woman told me the truth if it's
[59:24] my wife and she tells me what's right
[59:27] then I ought to be humble enough
[59:29] and clothe the veil of humility to say
[59:31] it's not her it's not the man it's not
[59:34] the position not the church not nobody
[59:36] it's truth that was spoken to me
[59:39] and I stay humble when I hear the truth
[59:42] it doesn't matter where it comes from
[59:44] hey believe me I'm a big guy right you
[59:47] know big and scary sometimes scare kids
[59:51] the miracle of God I teach them for as
[59:53] long as I have been being scary as I am
[59:55] but they've got to worry anymore they're
[59:57] not too scared of me my little Chinese
[59:59] kids come into the window now and they
[1:00:00] see me and they go the Viking the Viking
[1:00:07] but you know sometimes
[1:00:11] sometimes
[1:00:13] I've had little grannies come to me
[1:00:17] 80 pounds soaking wet
[1:00:20] 104 years old with blue hair
[1:00:24] get me by the arms as sunny
[1:00:26] think this way about it not that way
[1:00:28] about it
[1:00:29] now you know what some big tough
[1:00:31] preacher guys would do some little frail
[1:00:33] woman speak to him in that manner
[1:00:36] I'm the man of God who does she think
[1:00:38] she is
[1:00:40] but brother Jesse if I'm veiled in
[1:00:42] humility Hallelujah I'm willing to
[1:00:44] listen to truth no matter where it comes
[1:00:46] from
[1:00:47] amen amen I'm a child of Truth and I'll
[1:00:50] receive it when it comes to me
[1:00:53] oh I like that yes sir
[1:00:56] no matter who they are or what their
[1:00:57] name is or where they come from doesn't
[1:00:59] matter to me I want to hear what's
[1:01:00] rhymes
[1:01:02] therefore the Bible said submit yourself
[1:01:04] one to another
[1:01:06] people have problems with that kind of
[1:01:08] stuff
[1:01:09] this brother was saying to me
[1:01:12] the other night he said brother Ben
[1:01:14] you and your wife fuss
[1:01:18] what was going on with something about
[1:01:20] her she's always going on something
[1:01:21] about me
[1:01:23] well don't you think that you ought to
[1:01:25] straighten that out I said why
[1:01:28] some of the best fun I've ever had in my
[1:01:30] life leave me alone
[1:01:35] and you know for him he said to me
[1:01:38] he was raised by a very militant father
[1:01:40] who said women
[1:01:42] didn't have an opinion in the house
[1:01:47] is that what Peter said
[1:01:50] be subject one to another in other words
[1:01:52] you'd be subject to me and I'll decide
[1:01:54] when it's time for you to be subject or
[1:01:56] not be subject or vice versa I'll decide
[1:02:00] when it's time for me to be subject to
[1:02:02] you in other words
[1:02:04] that's not what the Bible's saying
[1:02:06] you see the family unit which is what
[1:02:08] makes up our churches by the way
[1:02:10] can only be strong enough
[1:02:13] to survive all of the pitfalls and the
[1:02:15] harshness of Trials persecutions and
[1:02:18] everything else if
[1:02:20] we learn to submit ourselves one to
[1:02:22] another
[1:02:24] some of our sisters and I I don't mean
[1:02:25] no harm by this but some of them have
[1:02:28] been absolutely beat down by these
[1:02:30] dictating men that don't even want the
[1:02:32] women to raise their head in the church
[1:02:33] house
[1:02:35] so they come to the house of God they
[1:02:37] feel like a second-class citizen
[1:02:39] and whether we like this or not we using
[1:02:42] Brother brahm's message incorrectly have
[1:02:45] created race Wars gender Wars and
[1:02:48] everything else in our churches because
[1:02:49] we have forgotten the basis of this
[1:02:51] scripture right here
[1:02:53] submit ourselves one to another
[1:02:56] sure we have
[1:02:58] got to come walk into the platform one
[1:03:00] time talking about how you know that all
[1:03:03] of the evil started from a black man the
[1:03:05] serpent what he said
[1:03:09] I went back one day there's been many
[1:03:10] many years ago
[1:03:12] you know something a big rich white guys
[1:03:14] telling me yeah that's what that's
[1:03:15] that's right that's right I said wait a
[1:03:17] minute
[1:03:18] I had about 17 at the time I said
[1:03:20] where'd president say that at
[1:03:23] I was reading one day brother Jesse and
[1:03:24] I come across the quote we used to call
[1:03:27] it hybrid religion they named it spoken
[1:03:28] word you were going to see many years
[1:03:29] later the whole book is hybrid religion
[1:03:32] and in that very book brother Venom said
[1:03:34] they're trying to lay the serpent off to
[1:03:36] the colored race there's as ignorant as
[1:03:38] they can be he said color that was
[1:03:39] brother Ram's turn back in the 50s
[1:03:42] in other words the black people
[1:03:43] African-Americans whatever how you want
[1:03:45] to say it
[1:03:46] he said there's as ignorant as they can
[1:03:48] be
[1:03:49] what does that create
[1:03:51] it creates a divide in the church
[1:03:54] where if you're not white or you're not
[1:03:57] some kind of a uh
[1:04:00] typical atypical American
[1:04:03] white skin and whatever more
[1:04:06] somehow another God looks at you better
[1:04:08] than they looks at the the Asian or the
[1:04:10] uh whatever race they may be
[1:04:14] creating weight race Wars in churches
[1:04:18] because we focus upon you know these
[1:04:20] things and brother I'm going to describe
[1:04:22] Adam and Eve and he talked about Eve
[1:04:23] with her blonde hair and her blue eyes
[1:04:25] red Ram didn't do things like that
[1:04:27] because he was trying to throw off on
[1:04:29] One race or support another one he was
[1:04:31] just putting it in terms that he could
[1:04:32] understand
[1:04:34] he was dramatized in his own way
[1:04:38] and yet people will take things like
[1:04:40] that and use that to drive down the
[1:04:42] other groups in the church sure they do
[1:04:45] it you can sit look at me and be quiet
[1:04:46] all you want to but I'm telling you the
[1:04:48] truth and you know I'm telling you the
[1:04:49] truth
[1:04:51] sure I am
[1:04:53] gender wars in the church
[1:04:56] I said this some time ago in Iowa I was
[1:04:59] at brother Brooks says and I I I I wish
[1:05:01] I'd have expressed it better than what I
[1:05:03] said it up there but I was talking about
[1:05:05] you look at sisters in this day and age
[1:05:07] around the message
[1:05:08] and there's a lot of similarities
[1:05:10] between them you look at the girls
[1:05:11] they've all got the same kind of clothes
[1:05:13] the same kind of flat shoes and the same
[1:05:15] kind of hairdos
[1:05:17] that's all right Holiness unto the Lord
[1:05:19] fine
[1:05:20] Holiness is one thing but manufacturing
[1:05:22] is another
[1:05:24] and if we're not careful we're going to
[1:05:26] lose our individuality as believers
[1:05:28] and we're going to start adopting
[1:05:30] standards of what we call holiness
[1:05:33] that ain't nothing but a manufactured
[1:05:35] religion
[1:05:37] you take some of the African sisters and
[1:05:39] some of the colors and the bright colors
[1:05:41] they wear my mother's an old hardcore
[1:05:43] Apostolic she wouldn't be caught dead in
[1:05:46] some of them bright colors like that
[1:05:47] because to her you're sinning
[1:05:50] but like I told my mama a thousand times
[1:05:52] that's what they taught back in the 50s
[1:05:54] that ain't what's true that's not
[1:05:56] according to the message bright colors
[1:05:58] don't make you a prostitute that's what
[1:05:59] some of the more people believe
[1:06:02] hello somebody
[1:06:05] but what has it done created all kinds
[1:06:07] of schisms
[1:06:09] because we don't submit ourselves one to
[1:06:13] another
[1:06:14] I heard a story one time about the
[1:06:16] prophet of God and this gives you a good
[1:06:17] example of the attitude we should have
[1:06:19] about things like this
[1:06:21] brother Brown was down somewhere I think
[1:06:23] it was around the natives
[1:06:24] there was some kind of place and I
[1:06:26] forget it might have been even in Africa
[1:06:28] now that I think about it
[1:06:29] but anyways these men got down and they
[1:06:32] started worshiping at the bottom at the
[1:06:33] foot of a totem pole
[1:06:36] they looked around some of the brothers
[1:06:37] about to say isn't that awful and they
[1:06:39] looked around by the brown was down
[1:06:40] there with them
[1:06:43] he got back up in the truck and they
[1:06:45] said brother Branham what in the world
[1:06:47] were you doing he said see you don't
[1:06:48] understand
[1:06:50] they were worshiping the true God they
[1:06:52] just didn't know what he was all about
[1:06:53] so I got down there and worshiped with
[1:06:55] him he said because I know who he is
[1:06:59] he's not that God in that Idol down
[1:07:00] there and I guess brother round was down
[1:07:02] there with him raising his hand saying
[1:07:03] thank you Jesus thank you Lord
[1:07:04] hallelujah
[1:07:06] they didn't even have the vocabulary to
[1:07:08] say it
[1:07:10] but Paul said I became a man to all men
[1:07:12] Glory
[1:07:13] that I might win the sinner
[1:07:16] and those that have no understanding and
[1:07:18] that's the same thing we've experienced
[1:07:20] around the ranks of this message we want
[1:07:22] people to come to the church that are
[1:07:24] already well trained and know all the
[1:07:26] message could say is and all the message
[1:07:28] words
[1:07:31] God help us if we had a group of people
[1:07:33] come walking in here tonight women would
[1:07:35] cut hair and man was shorts on and
[1:07:37] whatever other kind of thing they come
[1:07:39] walking to the back door and we'd set
[1:07:40] them down and we said don't you know
[1:07:42] what the prophet of God said
[1:07:45] no wonder we have completely forgotten
[1:07:47] the mission of the church is to go out
[1:07:49] there and win people to Jesus Christ
[1:07:51] [Applause]
[1:07:53] take them from any background any
[1:07:55] situation
[1:07:56] and place them where they can serve god
[1:07:58] without a hitch
[1:08:01] but we've tried to put people in a
[1:08:03] condition and put people in a position
[1:08:05] to where we want them to be the complete
[1:08:07] perfect message prototype
[1:08:10] before they sit down on our pews
[1:08:15] I could read you a couple things here
[1:08:16] I'm going to say because time won't let
[1:08:18] me
[1:08:19] but Brethren said that's where Pentecost
[1:08:21] has fell bitterly
[1:08:23] he said they want to get the Upper Crust
[1:08:25] he called it
[1:08:27] and they've long forgotten to go to the
[1:08:28] prostitute in the center and the
[1:08:30] drunkard and everybody else
[1:08:34] what am I trying to say this is why
[1:08:36] schisms have come
[1:08:39] because we've lost the vision
[1:08:42] as a people as a group
[1:08:44] seemingly we we've lost you say how can
[1:08:47] you be Samoan and say that look around
[1:08:49] us
[1:08:50] everywhere you go everywhere you see
[1:08:53] people are into themselves
[1:08:56] they have no concern for that guy
[1:08:58] walking down the street
[1:08:59] I just found out that his baby is
[1:09:01] addicted to some kind of painkiller or
[1:09:03] some kind of a thing or his wife's about
[1:09:05] to leave you more some kind of a thing
[1:09:07] he's involved in
[1:09:09] and you walking around with that Jesus
[1:09:11] in your heart
[1:09:13] holding the very answer to the very
[1:09:14] questions they're holding
[1:09:17] and yet we put our nose in the air and
[1:09:19] keep stepping on
[1:09:20] and then it comes sat down in the church
[1:09:22] house hypocritically
[1:09:24] and say well we love God with all of our
[1:09:26] hearts Jesus made his reputation with
[1:09:28] Sinners folks
[1:09:31] and we should be willing
[1:09:35] you say what are you saying brother Ben
[1:09:36] we should be willing this is what I'm
[1:09:38] telling you listen to me carefully we
[1:09:40] should be willing to Humble ourselves
[1:09:43] to help anybody within our spirit of
[1:09:46] influence
[1:09:50] I've seen a time in churches where
[1:09:52] people of different color wouldn't even
[1:09:53] shake hands
[1:09:57] sure
[1:10:00] some man said about a sister one time
[1:10:02] she's real exuberant talked a lot and
[1:10:04] was really chatty
[1:10:05] the guy got away from her and he looked
[1:10:07] at me and he said boy that woman needs
[1:10:09] to learn some submission I knew this
[1:10:11] family very well
[1:10:13] fact of the matter is she might have
[1:10:14] been a chatty Kathy but when old buddy
[1:10:16] said we're going to do it this way she
[1:10:18] said yes sir and how high should I jump
[1:10:21] she's completely surrendered to her
[1:10:22] husband in every way
[1:10:25] personality
[1:10:27] is not a sign of not being surrendered
[1:10:30] hello somebody
[1:10:32] having a bride exuberant demonstrative
[1:10:35] personality is not a sign
[1:10:37] that you're not surrendered
[1:10:40] people have treated folks that have been
[1:10:42] really wild and exuberant and talkative
[1:10:45] and what more almost like boy you need
[1:10:47] to get humbled down they think humility
[1:10:49] is being dead quiet never say in a word
[1:10:52] and being passive and letting everybody
[1:10:53] beat on you all the time
[1:10:57] they think a humble person walks around
[1:10:59] Walmart with their Bible in their arms
[1:11:00] saying amen praise the Lord God bless
[1:11:02] you
[1:11:04] it's manufactured
[1:11:06] humility real humility
[1:11:09] is being able to demonstrate to anybody
[1:11:11] in any circumstances any time or any
[1:11:14] spot of life
[1:11:15] that what God Said is true and I'm
[1:11:17] willing to obey it
[1:11:19] and help you understand how it fits
[1:11:21] together
[1:11:23] amen are we together now
[1:11:26] sure but we create these things in the
[1:11:28] churches
[1:11:29] yeah I know white men have been
[1:11:31] prejudiced but there have been a lot of
[1:11:32] prejudice people on the other side too
[1:11:35] it's easy for uh you know people that
[1:11:38] have got control of a place
[1:11:42] to do certain things I was in a a camp
[1:11:44] meeting number of years ago
[1:11:46] and I won't dare call this brother's
[1:11:49] name I love him he's my buddy he calls
[1:11:50] me big brother now
[1:11:52] but I'm the only white guy in 5 000
[1:11:55] people
[1:11:57] and he's laying it on about the
[1:11:58] Americans how awful the Americans are
[1:12:01] I'm going to tell you right now these
[1:12:02] Americans aren't going to deceive us I'm
[1:12:04] the only American in the place
[1:12:08] laughs
[1:12:10] but listen I know these things make
[1:12:13] people uncomfortable but you shouldn't
[1:12:14] be uncomfortable what we should be is we
[1:12:17] should be honest with ourselves and say
[1:12:18] you know Lord that is the nature of the
[1:12:21] world to pick at issues like that and
[1:12:24] create things like that we should be
[1:12:26] subject one to another
[1:12:29] amen do you agree with that
[1:12:31] I think it's true as well
[1:12:34] so she closed herself in humility
[1:12:37] all right now let's move on to something
[1:12:39] else same idea
[1:12:41] but sometimes leaders preachers like
[1:12:43] myself can get themselves so high above
[1:12:46] the people
[1:12:47] some fellow ask a question or ask some
[1:12:50] kind of thing have you oh you just
[1:12:51] squared them shoulders back and say how
[1:12:53] dare you question me
[1:12:58] what does it cause it's caused people to
[1:13:00] look at preachers as dictators not
[1:13:03] servants
[1:13:06] dictators are not God's way of Leading
[1:13:09] the People God never sent a dictator to
[1:13:12] no place in any way shape form or
[1:13:14] fashion never in the world has God ever
[1:13:15] ordained a dictator to leave the church
[1:13:19] Real Men of God are servants to you
[1:13:22] they humble themselves to your needs
[1:13:26] aha
[1:13:28] unless of course you don't think that
[1:13:30] you know maybe that time that you made
[1:13:32] that phone call and brother Jesse
[1:13:34] happened to answer or brother so and so
[1:13:36] happened to answer
[1:13:37] and he was so sweet with you and so kind
[1:13:39] and took an hour with you and you just
[1:13:41] kept going with another conversation and
[1:13:42] kept going and kept going and what you
[1:13:44] didn't know was that the family was
[1:13:46] standing with a picnic basket and things
[1:13:47] ready to go out when you called them
[1:13:50] but what does he do he humbles himself
[1:13:55] his family has to Humble themselves to
[1:13:58] be servants to the people
[1:14:00] and let me tell you all something and I
[1:14:02] don't I I'd say this about digestive
[1:14:04] about any family
[1:14:05] being a preacher's kid is a hard job
[1:14:08] because you gotta you live in a fishbowl
[1:14:12] and it's tough you have to live by a
[1:14:14] standard of living sometimes my kids
[1:14:17] sometimes get so aggravated to me about
[1:14:19] things little tiny things that ain't no
[1:14:22] big deal and quite honestly it wouldn't
[1:14:23] even be sinful
[1:14:25] but I said if you do that people are
[1:14:28] going to judge me as a minister based on
[1:14:29] that one thing out there and we don't
[1:14:31] want to cost cast stumbling blocks and
[1:14:34] cause somebody to lose their influence
[1:14:35] or their feeling toward the ministry
[1:14:37] we've got to be careful about things
[1:14:39] sometimes even more so careful than
[1:14:41] other people
[1:14:44] but if the church is surrendered to the
[1:14:46] pastor and the pastor surrendered to the
[1:14:48] church you know what president said here
[1:14:50] if they're happy and he's happy God is
[1:14:52] happy
[1:14:54] I like that
[1:14:58] amen but we can't come to the place of
[1:15:00] such exaltation
[1:15:03] you know in churches I've said this to
[1:15:05] you before but we have Patriarchs and
[1:15:07] matriarchs
[1:15:08] our churches are made up of a lot of
[1:15:10] these kind of people and you know you
[1:15:12] take somebody that was in a lot of
[1:15:14] brother Rams meetings or they were
[1:15:15] somebody that you know uh uh you know I
[1:15:18] I got a piece of brother Brown's
[1:15:19] suitcase or his sleeping bag or I was in
[1:15:22] the seals when they come in and you know
[1:15:24] or something like that
[1:15:26] people almost look at that individual as
[1:15:28] being the old sage of wisdom that knows
[1:15:31] all the answers
[1:15:35] but look at what Paul said but when
[1:15:38] someone Young comes along
[1:15:40] he said don't despise their youth
[1:15:45] being subject one to another now this is
[1:15:47] important for us
[1:15:48] because you know it's older people we
[1:15:49] don't like to listen to the younger one
[1:15:52] we don't you might as well say hey man I
[1:15:54] can't this way it's true
[1:15:56] we all we think we know everything
[1:15:59] some young kid come say something a
[1:16:01] little certain things
[1:16:03] you stupid kid get out of my face
[1:16:05] twice as well I got food in the
[1:16:07] refrigerator older and you get out of
[1:16:08] here
[1:16:13] but who was it that Jesus used
[1:16:16] to feed five thousand
[1:16:19] a little boy
[1:16:21] another city playing hooky from school
[1:16:23] and had his lunch box with him
[1:16:28] Paul tells Timothy be thou an example
[1:16:31] this word example in the Greek means to
[1:16:33] make a stroke or a blow or an impression
[1:16:38] so in other words don't just say it but
[1:16:41] be an example in word indeed in Doctrine
[1:16:45] and spirit and in life Hallelujah
[1:16:48] what are you talking about brother Ben
[1:16:50] I'm talking about a mighty Army of God
[1:16:52] that you can't put a Schism between
[1:16:55] this is the kind of body that cannot be
[1:16:57] defeated
[1:16:58] Hallelujah this is the kind of army that
[1:17:01] cannot be overcome in this state there's
[1:17:04] such love there they are absolutely
[1:17:06] undefeatable and unconquerable
[1:17:10] that's why Satan could not defeat that
[1:17:12] early church they were bound together
[1:17:15] they had all things in common
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:19] praise God
[1:17:23] all right you ready with your Bibles
[1:17:25] let's go
[1:17:27] Second Chronicles 34 27.
[1:17:31] do they read out loud do you read
[1:17:34] you do good
[1:17:37] all right you're the first one that
[1:17:38] looked at me so you're going to read
[1:17:41] Second Chronicles 34 27.
[1:17:45] I'll give you a hint it's in the Old
[1:17:47] Testament
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:56] now why sister is finding it there
[1:17:58] listen this brother said the first thing
[1:17:59] you've got to do is surrender yourself
[1:18:02] entirely to Christ
[1:18:05] surrender your mind to his word
[1:18:08] listen these words Lord I won't act upon
[1:18:12] my own feelings or my own thoughts
[1:18:15] oh my God if I could get that drove to
[1:18:18] you as a revelation tonight I'd solved
[1:18:20] 99 of our problems in life
[1:18:23] I will not act upon how I feel I will
[1:18:26] not act upon how I think Glory
[1:18:30] I'll just wait on you
[1:18:33] tell me the answer for the next step
[1:18:36] Hallelujah
[1:18:39] and if I can have that kind of
[1:18:41] submission and patience how could I lose
[1:18:45] when I'm waiting on the one that is the
[1:18:47] Conqueror of all things
[1:18:50] hey man
[1:18:53] what's now second Chronicles 34 27 got

[1:19:29] do good in school don't you
[1:19:32] I want you to notice this
[1:19:35] that that pause your mind a moment and
[1:19:37] go back and catch some of this here
[1:19:40] okay number one their heart was tender
[1:19:45] you don't you don't get it do you
[1:19:48] you don't fully understand it let me
[1:19:49] break it down to you
[1:19:51] unless your heart is this
[1:19:53] you'll never get any of this other
[1:19:56] you know what some people don't get any
[1:19:58] further with God than they are because
[1:19:59] their heart isn't tender anymore they've
[1:20:02] let life they've let circumstances
[1:20:04] they've let trials tribulations huh they
[1:20:08] let all of that Harden them to where
[1:20:10] they don't even have faith to believe
[1:20:12] that God could do anything for him
[1:20:14] anymore
[1:20:15] we must keep our hearts
[1:20:19] tender before the Lord how do I keep
[1:20:21] myself tender before God
[1:20:24] I keep myself in a constant state of
[1:20:27] needing him
[1:20:29] never thank myself to be self-sufficient
[1:20:31] or that I can do it on my own keep
[1:20:34] myself in a place God I need you it
[1:20:36] won't be accomplished
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:39] amen
[1:20:41] right right
[1:20:43] he said thou let us humble thyself you
[1:20:45] heard the words
[1:20:47] you rinse your clothes all right the
[1:20:50] Jews now
[1:20:51] when they would humble themselves it was
[1:20:53] a common tradition for a Jew
[1:20:58] to grab their beard if they're a man
[1:20:59] pluck it out
[1:21:01] take their clothes and rip them like
[1:21:03] this
[1:21:05] to get down on the ground grab the dirt
[1:21:07] and rub dirt on their face and they
[1:21:08] would get into what they would call The
[1:21:09] Wailing spawn
[1:21:11] they'd rot back and forth like that this
[1:21:14] was their way
[1:21:15] of showing God
[1:21:18] that they were trying to Humble
[1:21:20] themselves before him
[1:21:21] you know we have a similar custom
[1:21:25] deny ourselves the pleasures of Flesh
[1:21:27] sometimes
[1:21:29] often
[1:21:32] the way we dress and talk and walk
[1:21:35] things we say no to
[1:21:38] it shows God and on very much the same
[1:21:40] way as them Jews showed it
[1:21:42] that we're humbling ourselves before the
[1:21:44] Lord
[1:21:46] when a sister wears an appropriate dress
[1:21:48] and a brother has the appropriate
[1:21:49] conversation sees him with assault and
[1:21:52] the grace of God in his mouth and so
[1:21:54] forth like that it shows humility to God
[1:21:58] humility isn't shown by people walking
[1:22:00] around going oh now brother now sister I
[1:22:04] just
[1:22:06] you putting that on because you're
[1:22:07] trying to prove something to somebody
[1:22:10] you want to prove something you prove it
[1:22:12] in the way that you're surrendered to
[1:22:14] Jesus Christ
[1:22:16] surrender to truth surrender to the word
[1:22:18] you don't have to put it on just do the
[1:22:20] action of being surrendered and watch
[1:22:22] and see if humility don't follow it
[1:22:25] Walks Like A Duck talks like a duck it
[1:22:27] ain't gonna be a chicken
[1:22:29] two plus two is still four and every
[1:22:32] mathematical science of the world
[1:22:36] and if you allow yourself to be
[1:22:37] surrendered to Christ humility will be
[1:22:40] the product
[1:22:42] of what you get
[1:22:46] imagine that
[1:22:48] all right Psalm 10 17 who's next
[1:22:52] you yeah you looked right at me you want
[1:22:54] this one all right
[1:22:55] Psalm 10 17. it's all right brother
[1:22:57] Jesse picking on me all right
[1:23:02] Psalm 10 17.
[1:23:05] you got it you got it go
[1:23:15] how about that
[1:23:18] not only another great reader but
[1:23:19] another great scripture
[1:23:23] do you want God to hear your desire
[1:23:26] do you
[1:23:28] how does it happen
[1:23:31] the desire of the
[1:23:35] humble
[1:23:38] everybody's got desires folks
[1:23:41] but God don't hear every desire that
[1:23:43] comes across his desk
[1:23:45] he's looking for those that are willing
[1:23:47] to be humble humble means if I ask God
[1:23:49] for something and he says no
[1:23:52] I'm willing to say okay
[1:23:54] you know what's best for me
[1:23:56] that's true humility
[1:23:58] you mean Lord you're going to make that
[1:24:00] decision as I said this morning he don't
[1:24:02] consult us it's fine
[1:24:04] but if I'm humble whatever he chooses
[1:24:07] I'm willing to go through that
[1:24:10] if it be that way
[1:24:12] right Proverbs 16 19. who else who will
[1:24:15] my next victim I mean my next reader

[1:24:44] they got plenty of time to worry about
[1:24:47] Proverbs 16 19.
[1:25:12] good job baby dog good good reading nice
[1:25:16] job nice job
[1:25:18] do you know what spoil means what
[1:25:20] spoilers
[1:25:26] it's rich people you know
[1:25:28] the Bible said better it is to be of a
[1:25:31] humble spirit with low people
[1:25:34] the poor disenfranchised
[1:25:38] the lower crust
[1:25:40] than it is to have so much that you can
[1:25:42] divide what you got
[1:25:44] with proud you know what that looks like
[1:25:46] don't you when people divide with the
[1:25:48] suppose you know how them big guys they
[1:25:49] get together well
[1:25:51] we went to Switzerland this year where
[1:25:53] did you go we went to Taco Bell
[1:25:59] bragging rights for everything they do
[1:26:01] I'm not saying you can't talk about trip
[1:26:03] or something but I mean this bragging
[1:26:05] thing of we got this and we got that
[1:26:07] when you see that kind of stuff like
[1:26:08] that somebody walk around bragging on
[1:26:10] their chest stuck out how much money
[1:26:12] they spend how much they bought and what
[1:26:13] they've done that now
[1:26:15] had a woman many years ago as a pastor's
[1:26:17] wife she sat at the table and flashed
[1:26:19] her phone back and forth like that yeah
[1:26:21] it's fourteen hundred dollars this phone
[1:26:22] right here
[1:26:24] it wouldn't have been so bad except for
[1:26:25] the preacher only put 180 in the offer
[1:26:32] proud God hates a proud look
[1:26:35] Proverbs 29 23 who's next
[1:26:42] all right you got you got
[1:26:45] it look it up Proverbs 29 23.
[1:26:52] these are some good scriptures now
[1:26:55] these are good to keep notes on remember
[1:26:58] Proverbs 29 and then 23.
[1:27:03] I don't do 23 and 29 and you'll get the
[1:27:05] wrong scripture be backers
[1:27:07] 29 23.
[1:27:11] I'm just filling in time while they find
[1:27:13] their place
[1:27:15] Proverbs 29 23. you got it
[1:27:25] I pulled the humble and spirit right
[1:27:27] good job good job kiddo
[1:27:30] so a man's Pride will bring him where
[1:27:35] who wants to be there
[1:27:38] unless he wants his name singing about
[1:27:40] your achy breaky heart or if I hadn't
[1:27:42] Friends in Low Places
[1:27:44] Brooks one at Garth Brooks Ron Brooks we
[1:27:47] got a better Brooks than that Bruce
[1:27:51] unless you've got that attitude of well
[1:27:53] I like I like hanging with the you know
[1:27:56] but a man's Pride
[1:27:58] in other words we'll bring him to the
[1:28:00] ghetto
[1:28:02] it'll take him to a place of such low
[1:28:05] Place see this is one reason
[1:28:07] well Jesse when we see this prideful
[1:28:09] stuff going on around the churches and
[1:28:10] things like that it's one reason why in
[1:28:13] some ways just let it go
[1:28:15] because eventually its Folly will be
[1:28:17] made manifest sometimes you got to take
[1:28:19] a stand speak out against things and
[1:28:21] praise God for everyone that does it
[1:28:22] every man of God that stands for
[1:28:24] principles and instructs other believers
[1:28:26] of how to think and what the word
[1:28:28] teaches
[1:28:29] but many times pride in somebody's heart
[1:28:32] like that all you got to do is give him
[1:28:34] time
[1:28:35] Oh Brother The Homer long Glory down in
[1:28:37] Alabama is a given time baby given time
[1:28:40] and that's right
[1:28:42] give them some time and you'll find out
[1:28:45] their pride
[1:28:47] will do what go before their fall
[1:28:53] but honor shall uphold The Humbling
[1:28:55] spirit so if you're humble in spirit
[1:28:57] obedient to God honor will always follow
[1:29:00] your life
[1:29:04] but see see that's easy to say a man to
[1:29:07] except for you're not attaching that to
[1:29:09] the fact that you don't feel like you
[1:29:11] come from a place of honor
[1:29:13] you think of your background Mommy and
[1:29:15] Daddy and cousin aunt and uncle and
[1:29:16] whatever and you look at that and you
[1:29:18] don't feel like that's an honorable
[1:29:19] place
[1:29:21] but it doesn't matter you don't have to
[1:29:23] come from royalty
[1:29:25] for honor to come to your doorstep well
[1:29:28] right all you got to do is be humble
[1:29:32] and God will bring honor right to your
[1:29:33] foot
[1:29:37] can we go a little bit further all right
[1:29:38] Isaiah 57 15.
[1:29:43] 57-15 whose name
[1:29:47] bigger kids can read too
[1:29:50] can that little one read
[1:29:53] no
[1:29:54] who else you'll have to put your arm up
[1:29:56] if you're trying to motion me you have
[1:29:58] it how about this before we let you read
[1:30:00] anybody else that didn't get to read one
[1:30:02] or read anybody
[1:30:04] put your hand up if you do or not we'll
[1:30:06] give it to say do you want to try to
[1:30:07] read no were you telling her just now
[1:30:10] were you reporting don't let him ask me
[1:30:12] I don't want to do it okay
[1:30:16] anybody else you want to try
[1:30:18] no
[1:30:19] yeah you do you want to try
[1:30:22] can she do it no she's not ready yet
[1:30:24] okay all right
[1:30:26] all right says looks like it's all you
[1:30:27] you ready
[1:30:28] Isaiah 57 15.
[1:30:34] a couple more scriptures we'll quit
[1:30:37] this has been good for me though
[1:30:39] I've enjoyed this
[1:30:42] this kind of preaching helps me
[1:30:44] helps me keep my focus don't you think
[1:30:46] so
[1:30:48] kind of brings you back down and think
[1:30:50] about things rethink really Isaiah 57 15
[1:30:54] got it
[1:31:17] contrite is that word comes right you
[1:31:20] know what contrite means
[1:31:22] means to be um what's a good explanation
[1:31:25] there Roger Majestic
[1:31:27] contract
[1:31:28] hey
[1:31:29] it's a beautiful way to put this they
[1:31:32] always ask I always ask a a school
[1:31:34] teacher how to handle those things like
[1:31:36] that
[1:31:38] right
[1:31:39] so in other words
[1:31:42] this is a Dandy this is beauty woman
[1:31:44] this is this
[1:31:47] God says I'm holy I'm the lofty one
[1:31:51] I dwell in a high and holy place but
[1:31:54] look here
[1:31:55] with him
[1:31:57] that is of a broken
[1:32:00] and humble spirit
[1:32:02] God help me say this right
[1:32:05] God shares his eternity his kingdom with
[1:32:10] the humble and the broken
[1:32:15] he don't share his riches his glory his
[1:32:18] power with those that are so prideful
[1:32:21] that if it was a rain it'd drowned him I
[1:32:23] got their nose stuck up near so high
[1:32:25] he shares himself
[1:32:33] you know what that does it gives me and
[1:32:35] you a chance
[1:32:36] to serve him in the best way we can
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:43] yes sir glory to God
[1:32:46] all right just a little further James 4.
[1:32:48] we're going to read two verses there's
[1:32:50] six and ten you know these so well you
[1:32:52] probably could almost quote them
[1:32:54] James 4. six and two
[1:33:07] this is a very beautiful passage of
[1:33:09] scripture both these verses are just
[1:33:11] just gorgeous I love them
[1:33:13] James 4 6 and 10 on who we got you ready
[1:33:16] all right
[1:33:18] that big Smith smile of yours Ain't No
[1:33:20] Way in the world I could have missed
[1:33:21] that I know he's right as a son come on
[1:33:31] yeah and I dropped down to verse 10 read
[1:33:33] 10 for me
[1:33:37] amen beautiful
[1:33:40] and see to the humble
[1:33:42] he doesn't just give you Grace did you
[1:33:44] get that
[1:33:47] he gives you more grace
[1:33:51] so if you humble yourself in the Lord
[1:33:54] that he'll lift you up but he'll give
[1:33:55] you the even more grace
[1:33:58] so whatever Grace you think you need
[1:34:00] whatever Grace you think you need it
[1:34:03] he'll turn around and give you even more
[1:34:05] than what you thought you did
[1:34:09] in other words it's like a little bitty
[1:34:11] tiny fish standing in the middle of the
[1:34:13] Atlantic Ocean and saying I drink all
[1:34:15] this water up in a week's time
[1:34:18] no way in the world could that little
[1:34:20] fishy ever exhaust the grace that's been
[1:34:22] given to it Hallelujah and so is it with
[1:34:25] the humble and those that learn how to
[1:34:27] surrender God just keeps pouring it on
[1:34:30] them
[1:34:32] you ever see people that are so blessed
[1:34:34] it's almost sickening
[1:34:35] when you gonna have troubles down your
[1:34:37] way
[1:34:39] you just don't know that guy that girl
[1:34:41] she got troubles they got troubles but
[1:34:43] they're just getting that much humbler
[1:34:45] that much humbler and God just keeps
[1:34:47] pouring it on that you don't even see
[1:34:49] the other stuff in the background oh
[1:34:51] that's the way I want to live right
[1:34:52] there amen live to such a level that God
[1:34:56] can just keep parting on me till people
[1:34:58] do it we say do you ever get sad do you
[1:35:00] ever have a problem
[1:35:03] it just happens to be that my blessings
[1:35:05] are a whole lot bigger than these curses
[1:35:06] That You Don't See
[1:35:09] I love that humble yourself in the sight
[1:35:12] of the Lord
[1:35:13] that means he's seeing me
[1:35:16] you have to have eyes to have sight
[1:35:19] and if I'm in his sight and he sees me
[1:35:22] thank now
[1:35:23] he sees all of me
[1:35:25] he sees the good
[1:35:27] he sees the bad he sees the indifferent
[1:35:30] he sees the parts of me that are not so
[1:35:32] shiny and Fabulous
[1:35:36] and yet if I stay humble no matter what
[1:35:39] part of me he sees he'll never hold it
[1:35:41] against me it'll never meet me at
[1:35:43] judgment he'll just keep pouring Grace
[1:35:45] on me to overcome overcome repent be
[1:35:48] forgiven get Mercy get Grace overcome
[1:35:51] fight win the battle
[1:35:54] it'll just keep coming
[1:35:57] now whether you realize it or not
[1:35:59] we've just put together the formula for
[1:36:02] a true Victorious Life you know that
[1:36:03] doesn't it
[1:36:05] so if you walk out of here tonight
[1:36:06] saying I just can't get no Victory I
[1:36:08] don't know what to do I'll just give you
[1:36:10] the answer to it and so do these kids
[1:36:11] all of us reading
[1:36:14] humility surrender
[1:36:17] yourself
[1:36:19] listen to this
[1:36:22] we'll bring it too close
[1:36:25] the prophet said like this
[1:36:28] and I I this question always stands out
[1:36:31] to me
[1:36:34] he said whether it's a man or woman he
[1:36:36] couldn't tell but the question is
[1:36:37] brother Branham
[1:36:39] I just can't give over completely to
[1:36:41] Jesus
[1:36:42] have I an evil spirit
[1:36:46] he said you can't surrender to Jesus
[1:36:50] he said I don't know whether you're a
[1:36:52] man or woman but he said what's the
[1:36:53] matter
[1:36:55] he said if you're a woman don't you have
[1:36:56] to surrender to your husband to be a
[1:36:58] wife
[1:36:59] surrender all that you are tell us the
[1:37:01] way he puts us
[1:37:03] little lady said you were virtuous and
[1:37:05] follow your life to stay virtuous
[1:37:09] he said but then you found somebody a
[1:37:11] man that you love you were his
[1:37:13] completely
[1:37:14] and the thing that you'd fought against
[1:37:16] all your life try to live clean clear
[1:37:17] virtuous now you surrender every bit of
[1:37:20] that to one man
[1:37:22] you put yourself completely in his hands
[1:37:24] you're his all that you stood for in
[1:37:27] decency moral and everything like that
[1:37:28] you turn it and surrendered over to this
[1:37:30] man why can't you do the same thing for
[1:37:33] Jesus
[1:37:35] I don't think you're possessed of an
[1:37:37] evil spirit
[1:37:39] but I think an evil spirit anoints you
[1:37:41] with them kind of thoughts
[1:37:44] to make you think you cannot surrender
[1:37:47] I'm closing here
[1:37:49] this is a lot of the problem
[1:37:52] with folks that get in their mind
[1:37:55] that somehow they can't surrender you
[1:37:57] know what it is it's not that you can't
[1:38:00] you were made and created and born with
[1:38:04] the ability to surrender to God
[1:38:07] but Satan's scheme is to try to make you
[1:38:10] think
[1:38:11] that you can't do it
[1:38:14] and if he keeps you thinking that it's
[1:38:16] impossible
[1:38:17] he that liar knows you'll never do it
[1:38:21] but if you ever just kick him in the
[1:38:23] face one time and say would you please
[1:38:25] shut up
[1:38:28] close your mouth don't say another word
[1:38:29] to me
[1:38:30] because I heard God's prophets say
[1:38:32] tonight brother Branham
[1:38:34] that I have the ability to surrender to
[1:38:36] God
[1:38:38] how do you know because you want to
[1:38:42] that's big evidence that you've got
[1:38:44] something you can surrender with
[1:38:46] if you want to that says everything
[1:38:49] about you but if you can't if you can't
[1:38:52] surrender
[1:38:53] it's not that you can't
[1:38:55] is that the devil tries to make you
[1:38:57] believe it's impossible
[1:38:59] but it's not
[1:39:00] with man
[1:39:02] things are possible
[1:39:03] but with God
[1:39:05] all things are possible stand with me
[1:39:10] praise the Lord
[1:39:12] let's say buddy
[1:39:15] praise His holy name praise His holy
[1:39:18] name
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:22] praise the Lord praise the Lord

[1:47:05] what an absolute completely totally
[1:47:09] wonderful privilege it is to be able to
[1:47:12] do that folks
[1:47:17] may not get around like that
[1:47:20] I've lost count of the times
[1:47:23] I've run into somebody in this message
[1:47:26] that won't do that right there
[1:47:29] stubborn hard-headed got everything
[1:47:32] figured out going to do their own way
[1:47:34] thank you
[1:47:35] breach until I almost fall in the floor
[1:47:37] scream holiday I'd climb up on the roof
[1:47:40] and carry on like a monkey if I thought
[1:47:43] I'd get their attention and get a new
[1:47:44] song
[1:47:45] about stood on my head almost try to get
[1:47:48] himself
[1:47:50] a hard head stubborn defiant you know
[1:47:55] what it is
[1:47:56] God has to give you that
[1:48:00] and if you've got that in your heart
[1:48:03] no matter how old you are no matter how
[1:48:06] long we've been around
[1:48:07] if you've got that feeling that Ministry
[1:48:10] of surrender as a wife as a Ministries
[1:48:12] if you've got that in you
[1:48:15] just forget about all your other
[1:48:17] problems and issues and all that and put
[1:48:19] that aside you ought to be the happiest
[1:48:21] person ever loves you man
[1:48:23] because I'm telling you not everybody
[1:48:25] has that
[1:48:26] I'm glad that Jesus put that in my heart
[1:48:30] many years ago
[1:48:32] and I pray if you let me stay straight
[1:48:34] that he never lets that leave me alone
[1:48:38] I may get discouraged upset I may get
[1:48:41] frustrated by all kinds of things you
[1:48:42] know life happens
[1:48:44] get your aggravated life get you down
[1:48:46] life gets
[1:48:48] you but God please don't ever let me
[1:48:50] become so discouraged or don't ever let
[1:48:52] me lose sight of what's really true in
[1:48:54] the word that I lose that feeling
[1:48:57] want to be completely surrendered to
[1:48:59] Jesus Christ
[1:49:01] you don't know this guy probably but
[1:49:04] years ago there was a preacher he's a
[1:49:06] message preacher he's just about dead
[1:49:08] and his weight is up and up up in 98 99
[1:49:11] years old something like that
[1:49:13] and he used to run big tent revivals and
[1:49:16] he said brother NORAD you know 10
[1:49:18] preachers had them rough voice brother
[1:49:19] no rod
[1:49:20] yeah
[1:49:22] he said I used to climb up to 10 posts
[1:49:24] and preach on the top I'm just trying to
[1:49:25] get their attention
[1:49:27] he said you know what I found out I said
[1:49:29] what is it brother he said if God don't
[1:49:31] put it in their heart
[1:49:33] no matter the demonstration no matter
[1:49:35] wildness or craziness and then nothing
[1:49:37] you can do let's go put it in there
[1:49:39] like for example you get done with a
[1:49:42] sermon like this today
[1:49:43] go home maybe get get in your car and
[1:49:45] start yelling at your youngins
[1:49:46] straighten up yell at the wife of the
[1:49:48] husband you heard the preacher tonight
[1:49:51] don't matter what you say to them no
[1:49:53] matter who's you're saying it to if God
[1:49:56] don't put this in you it ain't never
[1:49:57] going to be there
[1:49:59] so what is my advice if you look in your
[1:50:01] heart tonight and you see that ain't
[1:50:03] there you've heard the word which gives
[1:50:05] you an opportunity to say God put that
[1:50:08] in me put that in me
[1:50:14] because if I can handle to be surrender
