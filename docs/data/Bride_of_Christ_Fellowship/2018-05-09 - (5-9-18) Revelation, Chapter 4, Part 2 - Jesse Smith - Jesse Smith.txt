few believed we chose it see amen praise the Lord hallelujah praise God let's get right in the word tonight let's take our Bibles and let's go to Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 I like to continue on part 2 of the revelation chapter 4 by God's grace relation chapter 4 verse 1 Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 by the grace of the Lord now Lord willing tonight we'll just look at verse 3 but let's read up to verse 3 then we'll all read verse 3 I'll try to let you read I skipped you on Sunday I'm gonna try to let you read verse 3 I'll read verse 1 and 2 and we'll all read verse 3 revelation 4 verse 1 after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne let's read verse three one two three and he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God Heavenly Father Lord we're looking at your word tonight lo we're so happy to sing our songs and here the special from our brother and bring these requests before you Lord we know you'll meet all these prayer requests Lord God each and every one Lord from the most important serious life-threatening one down to the the unspoken and to our brother Aaron's traveling Lord and and to the mother with four children who's a single mother Lord you care about every single need Lord God and we're told to cast our cares upon you for you care for us Lord so we're casting our cares upon you Lord Jesus we trust you to take care of these requests Heavenly Father open this word now to us we've read it Lord you're the only one that can give the interpretation so we are trusting solely upon your Holy Spirit now bless us here tonight in thy divine presence in Jesus Christ's name never a said Amen god bless you bein seated praise the Lord you can switch over Mac I do have some slides here tonight by the grace of the Lord all right so by the grace of the Lord how's that okay we want to look at the next part this is part two of Revelation chapter 4 in my series but I think it's 72 overall by God's grace now I got a nice little update I told you I've been feeling led for a long time to do a postcard outreach at least to give people a chance to come to our church and let them know there's a message Church so I filled out all their forms and paid some money I think it was like five hundred dollars just to get the process started but that's most of the process I think is two hundred dollars for all the the postage so it's going to be about you know seven hundred eight hundred dollars there so I thought that was pretty good if 3500 people get a postcard from us that and they're all around this church but anyways I got the first draft back and I really like it but I just I just want Laura brother branham so I'm gonna send that back I want more brother branham and the pillar of fire because I told him I want these words on it the pillar of fire has spoken this generation and they got all of our information looks really professional I was really happy with it except I want them to see that pillar fire I can't even see it hardly it's right there my whole point of that was so they could see brother Branham in the pillar fire and I understand they're a company they don't know what we believe and they're kind of blending in brother Branham with the Cross which I like but I need to see that pillar fire more so this is the rough draft I think the people will catch it you know God sent a man perhaps you know the elect I'll say like this the elect will catch it and you might not even need a picture like I didn't need a picture to show me that water baptism was right but I appreciate the picture it's God letting us know he's taking this picture with this prophet anyways I thought that was a nice work first draft and on the back I have the dates I wanted to do a join us for our summer series of sermons from the teachings from the pillar of fire I really like that I told them to write that and then each Sunday in July at 4 p.m. I want to teach on message topics so they can hear all of us say the Lord's for today like baptism Godhead all those things that brother Brown gave us the stay at the Lord on and then the say the Lord for the future the United States Rush vatican everything we know for the future the power in jesus christ a baptism Godhead the twelve new testament mysteries that brother branham brought us in serves as it's the end time and then the book of revelation revealed basically all these sermons i'm preaching now all combined into one so just hit the highlights you know show who the symbols are who's that woman who's that woman in Revelation 12 with the with the twelve stars above her that's Israel and just you know reveal show the main revelations but if nobody comes at least we tried you know and we'll keep trying to send them out there but they haven't been sent out yet because I have to get to give final approval I like how they have the map and I like our service times and you know again and they they said we need picture of some ugly preachers I said okay I'll give you a picture of an ugly preacher you can put that on there but anyways I'm really excited about it because brother Branham said I don't have the quote here but brother Graham said that this is not the quote brother Branham said every Church should have a burden for their community and he said every community is on the shoulders of the church so I know you heard even brother Adam I prayed that many times brother Adam and I'm sure some of you too we sigh and cry for the abominations done in this city this is our city God has sent us to and the Bible of the Bible says that raksha after 17 God has determined the bounds of your habitation if you always wonder like how come I can't why am I just always tied to Akron or why you know for that that was my testimony football brought me here before I was a Christian and then God brought me here for you know to preach and be a pastor what is it you know what is about this community that I care so much about you know God gives the church that burden so we can try to win souls and brother BAM said the best way to win souls is through the preaching of the word so he said I find a hundred million dollars he said I would go around the world and hold campaigns to preach to sweep the bride into the rapture that's what he said so that's what we want to do try to invite them to come hear the preaching of the word and if people come praise the Lord if not then they at least answer on the day of judgment that they got a chance to hear it by the grace of the Lord so I want to just show you this quote from Sunday I mentioned it Sunday where Bodrum said this brother Adam said great things are taking place right now as the message goes around the world it's a great thing in the sight of God I mean know that brother branham said this he said so now in always whatever you do pray for me because we're now striking the fields for the last times in my opinion remember great things are taking place it's unknown amongst the world he said Jesus come lived I'd sacrifice went back to glory and millions never even know nothing about it see it's not flowery great big it's he came to his own see he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith of the churches not the outside to the church it's the church that gets the shaking now he eats he talks about this I'm not gonna read all this we talked about John the Baptist the Bible said John the Baptist would make every mountain low and he'd raise up every valley mother Branham said what was he he was a preacher preached in the mud with a he's got easy and grasshoppers and locusts and all these things and he just preached repentance and yet that was in God's sight making the mountains low and raising up the valleys so he says you have to have spiritual understanding God never did dwell and never will dwell in glamour he's against it the great messages will be never be make great big so and so and so and so it don't do it that way his sermons don't work in that matter his glamour and glory is above how many appreciate that by God's grace amen army army men fight little cold all day but I appreciate our prayer brother now before broadband preaches this message this is part two from 1961 he gives a word to the young converts so I just want to recount of rehearse what he says it was just a beautiful thought Butler Branham says I want to tell the young converts and he names two or three people in the church that are young converts he says you remember this when God says anything it will not fail and so two he said but brother Graham said he's waiting he does that to test you how do we know that by God's grace have you been through tests in your life where God makes you wait year after year after year he said program tells young converts you need to know that God when His Word says anything it will come to pass but he said he's waiting to do it many times to test us and so brother branham tells the young converts like Abraham God said take up your son and go kill him I'm gonna make you father of Nations although you waited 25 years for him or I'm sorry 20 yeah 25 years for him he said now kill him and it was God testing Abraham and he said that Abraham had such obedience he said I I've already received Isaac as one from the dead God did this to show us that he keeps his promise with Ram said no matter how impossible it seems does it seem impossible as you go about your life and you know every day is like a routine you do the same thing over and over sometimes I'll be honest to me sometimes it seems impossible how is God gonna get the bride in America ready for the rapture but we know there's nothing impossible with God God is going to do it he's gonna get the bride even the United States is remember when brother Graham saw the vision the bride United States was in line right the one for he said Switzerland or some other European countries and stay in line but the bride from the US was in line praise the Lord so there's going to be a Holy Ghost filled bride from the US who's ready for the rapture the RAM said no matter how impossible it seems God still remains God amen he said that is what I'm trying to say in the healing service no doubt you were sick he said but God keeps his promise that's his word - the converts now I want to make a note here because if the Lord willing I want to preach later on a few thoughts in this sermon anybody listening the sermon this week part 2 of Revelation and we listen to it okay you didn't have to but I just wondered if anybody did but there's two thoughts he doesn't really go into all the way I'd like to preach and I've never heard a preacher preach on him of course that's obvious because I don't go to many churches you know but if you have let me know so I want to get their tapes the first one brother Graham said there's a prophetic nature of the 12 sons or the 12 tribes of Israel brother Branham said Ephraim means by the sea and Ephraim was given his lot by the sea how many remember that so each of the twelve sons you know their name meant something and then there was prophecy over them about what they would accomplish in life well brother Branham makes it sound like there's prophecy about where they'll be in the end time when 144,000 or say now would that be something if if God could reveal that to us other man never really teaches it really thoroughly but I like to study on that and see what the scripture says about that second mother Bram said the twelve birthstones of the twelve tribes of Israel and their meanings I like to preach on that because brother Branham said Ephraim's birthstone was Jasper but I'll need more time to research all the stones because there's no scripture I've already looked up Jasper every time in the Bible and there's no time that you know Jasper it says it's called Ephraim's birthstone but there's like common Jewish knowledge out there where the the Orthodox Jews seem to know which stone belongs to which tribe and so I like to study on that and preach on that because there's got to be a lot of meaning in that because that is all it's later fulfilled in the foundations of the new city right the New Jerusalem so those are two thoughts I don't have prepared now because it's gonna take hours and hours and maybe days of studying on those but I would like to reach or dig down deep in those at some point by the God's grace so if you listen to those I know you'll have that same hunger for me like aren't you hunger and for more of God's Word Omaha IRA hear those I'm like God I wish there was a sermon on that but maybe God's called me to preach it or maybe some other preacher now let's start let's look at verse three I just want to preach on verse three and I think I'll get verse three done tonight so let me set my timer here by the grace of Lord I think I'll go about 45 more minutes I already did about 15 and spare myself here I haven't been sleeping good this week I've just had a really kind of rough week and I preach so hard on Sunday my voice heard all week so I didn't do a good job on Sunday with my voice so verse 3 and he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight and this is interesting it's a rainbow an insight he said it's like unto an emerald so there's like a dual meaning here with the rainbow there's a rainbow but yet in sight it's like it unto an emerald color so let's look at these thoughts like I said I'm pulling out the same thoughts from brother Brown and I'll tell you you know I'll tell you if there's I'm gonna at the end inject a thought that I found in the Greek lexicon that kind of builds some teaching in here by God's grace but everything else should be from brother branham's from sermons here now the first thought is that brother Branham reviews and says immediately I was in the spirit and brother Branham likened unto a baseball game I don't remember that story he said he went to a baseball game he saw a man hit a grand slam and the man next to him had a straw hat on he got so excited he took the hat up and he pulled it down on his head and it would turn he said it turned to be a collar around his neck he was so excited he looked at brother Branham and said aren't you excited and brother BAM said no I'm not really interested in baseball and brother BAM said he said that's because I'm not interested in baseball he said well I'm interested in is the Holy Ghost and he said if you were interested in the Holy Ghost like you are in baseball he said you'd do the same thing with me down there at the church he said and that's what being in the spirit is when you hear the voice of God he said it puts you in the spirit and so the brother BAM says it was the voice he said John was in the spirit he says when you begin to see things in the Bible you get in the spirit he said and when the Holy Spirit does something to you you just can't sit still there's something bubbles over in you you might bubble oftentimes I bubble over in to cry or shouting or you know clapping her you know but when the Spirit of God moves upon you it's so powerful many times that in your flesh you have to have some outlet for it right because that's what brother have said John was in the spirit when he heard the voice in the sphere on the Lord's Day and brother Branham said see he's a baseball fiend that guy's a baseball feat he get excited about baseball I called my friends they get excited about LeBron James and basketball you know that's what they post on Facebook and they get excited they jump and shout about that but we really shouldn't jump and shout about that we should only shout and jump about Jesus we should be more interested in Christ than we are with common natural things because my dad said you just can't sit still when the Holy Spirit does something to you he said he says whoo yeah something takes ahold you're a fiend for Christ and he said he's a baseball fiend just like a cigarette Fein so now Bram compares they're both addicted so when a person addicted to baseball is the same thing as being dicted to cigarettes they're both demon powers is that right and so by masters we can't be addicted to those things let's be addicted to the holy spirit I'm glad to say I've got a good addiction to that by God's grace and it's not life taking its life giving amen hallelujah Laura have said when you love the Lord just something in you reaches out grabs it's hungry and thirsting jesus said blessed are they for they shall be filled he said blessed are they to even thirst whether you've got it or not he said how many wants more of God let me ask you how many want more of God look I have said alright well the reason that you want more of God is because you're blessed hallelujah cuz bless her though they who hunger and thirst for God he said because you want it because you're blessed there's so many people that don't want it Oh hallelujah thought number two let's go next up that's just real short this one will take a little while get your Bibles handy I'm gonna go over the same scriptures brother Branham does so you can kind of see the thoughts he's trying to relay and I'll be honest this sermon in in particular itself was a deeper one a real deeper one because he's polling from all kinds all over the Bible to try to make these different principles and revelations or meanings from what the symbols are in verse 3 of Revelation chapter 4 so he's trying to explain the Jasper the sardine the rainbow and the Emerald so we're basically looking at those four tonight and so he's pulling scriptures from all over and I'll be honest is what I had to really listen closely to even more so than many many sermons I listen to so let's uh let's get our Bibles here now the first thought he wants to say is that both John and Ezekiel saw the same thing whether Bram said they saw him in the mystery of his colors and light so there's a mystery behind the colors that are used and the light that we see there's a mystery behind that alright so let's start off brother Branham reads revelation 4 3 and then he said I noticed he said John stood and seen him sitting in the throne and he was to look like Jasper and sardine stone now all the things and every word has a meaning in the Bible not now if you'll compare if you'll notice it compares with the rest of the scripture so brother Branham says in other words you can take Jasper and look for it in the Bible in another place and it'll help you explain what that means same thing with rainbow same thing with sardine same thing with Emeril that's what we're gonna do tonight the scriptures brother Baron pointing us to where look at those tonight all right now here's what brother Branham says now I don't have a scripture for this so brother Branham says you'll just have to take my word for it this is why we have to you know if we want to and preach on these stones Jasper and sardine and all the ten other stones we're have to do some research in the Jewish encyclopedias perhaps brother Ram said now he said ha me know who the first child of Jacob was he said was Reuben he said now the birthstone of Reuben was Jasper now you won't find that in the scripture brother he must have got this from somewhere else and then he says the birthstone of Benjamin was sardine sobre have said Jesus was looked upon as Reuben and Benjamin he said which is the first and the last he that which was which is and shall come he was the Alpha in the Greek alphabet Omega in the Greek alphabet he was the first and last he was from Benjamin to Reuben and from Reuben to Benjamin he said there he was see like that by God's grace somehow program bounces he said from Jasper to sardine is from Reuben to Benjamin in other words Jesus is everything that Israel was looking for he was from the beginning to the end now it's interesting the name jasper means glittering so here we see christ represented as a glittering stone the color of a glittering stone is shining glittering and remember jasper is called most precious in the bible this is a most precious stone that represents Christ now sardine here represents the sardius stone and this this is here found let's go to Revelation 21 we'll find it here let's go to Revelation 21 in the future home and I got a little picture here I'll talk about this in a moment let's turn to Revelation 21 verse 10 this is the most Scripture when I could find on Google search so Revelation 21 10 and Malachi can you read verse 2 10 and 11 for me amen now that's getting back to the future home we'll get there in a moment as well but this is kind of what we saw we have a there's a rainbow round about the throne and it's in the sight as this emerald now this is the best drawing it's way better than I could do that's why I appreciated it because I could never draw like this you have your four beasts you know and there's four and twenty elders and all the angelic hosts in the background that's the best picture I could find that fits this Bible description that I can find okay so one of these colors of course Jasper and sardine now Malachi just read us the scripture about the wall around the new city and remember I preached this about two years ago he just read this the wall of the city I've started the next verse after he read that will be the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the twelve names of the apostles of the Lamb and brother Graham said in the future home he said the wall that's around this had twelve foundations and each one of them had the breast stone was an errand which represented the twelve tribes of Israel how many could say amen to that now we go later on in the chapter of Revelation 21 and the foundation of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper so jasper is the first which kind of links us to reuben this is where brother Branham at has a good Bible foundation because remember the Old Testament doesn't say Reubens stone was Jasper it doesn't say that but here if we put our scriptural puzzle together we start seeing that the first stone was Jasper brother bran said Jasper represents Reuben and then second sapphire third I can't even say that chalcedony the fourth emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius so see that's interesting sardius sardine sardine stone so it's a little so the order may not fit there like I said I don't have enough state the Lord on this I'm just showing you what brother Graham said Christ alight the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase pricess the eleventh jaqen and then the twelfth amethyst okay I probably ripped up those names so forgive me now here's just give you a picture so we have Jasper which is blood red which blood red reminds us of the blood of Christ the oldest one then sardine so Jasper and sardine remember there's emerald round about the throne so there's a rainbow with all these twelve cars but then in sight it's as emerald round about the throne that's the best picture I could find as far as understanding this and brother Branham says both of them here in his teaching so remember those twelve stones we're also on the breastplate of the high priests right now this is the best picture I could find of the the foundation of the future home the walls so see it doesn't even have 12 of these so don't don't say I'm preaching false doctrine I know I know that this is wrong I know that if there was 12 different colors then it would work out but there's not this picture only had one two three four five six seven eight only had eight so I'm not preaching false doctrine it's just the best picture I could find if you want to take time and draw a little picture that'd be wonderful share it with me then put it in the right order but I'm just letting you know it had 12 foundations right and so this is the idea it has something like this it has 12 different stones right and it's shining the glory of God now remember how big that was this is not to scale this walls too the wall is too large to put on on this scale but the wall itself this wall itself member has three gates on each side he says the wall itself is 216 feet which is 19 stories tall okay and 216 feet is 14% of 1500 square feet because that's how tall it is 1,500 square feet then in the new city okay so the wall itself is about 14% of the size of the city so you can imagine how big that that wall in that city is by the grace of Lord remember Jasper and then sardine would be the 7th there all right does that help by God's grace so the first thing brother Graham does is connect us for how Jasper's used in Revelation as well so Jasper's at the throne but one day Jasper is also going to be in the foundation of the wall around the new city and Jasper was also on the breastplate of the high priests so God really likes Jasper and it represents God so does he love sardine and all the other colors now next brother ram leaves this but i'm gonna leave this up here just for the sake of the time and let's go to Ezekiel chapter 1 now brother bran wants to show us amber an emerald like amber amber color so let's go to Ezekiel chapter 1 verse 1 how many have studied this sermon itself has anybody actually studied it all by themselves Jose has okay one person okay well praise the Lord that's good as fresh to everybody zekiel 1 verse 1 it was fresh to me i'm i actually never studied this sermon itself individually i know i've heard it because i've preached or heard thing preached about i've listened to him I never actually studied it really to preach it till now Ezekiel 1 verse 1 now and it came to pass in the thirteenth year in the fourth month in the day of the month as among the captives by the river Chebar that the heavens were open and I saw the visions of God in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of the King Jehoiachin captivity the word Lord came expressed in Ezekiel the priest the son of boos I in the land of Chaldeans by the river Chebar and the hand of Lord was there upon him and I looked at me hold a world and came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself an interesting fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber and I'm starting out of the myths of the fire now brother ram uses a myrrh the same as emerald just so you know so we're getting that same light greenish greenish yellow color okay verse five and out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man all right now next verse 26 is now the prophet of God takes us down to verse 26 here alright verse 26 he reads 26 27 28 and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as appearance of a man above it and I saw the color of amber as the appearance of fire roundabout within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loins even downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire and had brightness round about as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord and when I saw I fell upon my face and I heard the voice as one speak that spoke Amen how many like that by God's grace so I had never really studied on that too much until this one so Brougham tells us this he says this he said now see how this vision of Ezekiel compares with John he said notice the color of the Spirit of God which was above the likeness of these four creatures was amber and amber is yellowish green he said see he revealed himself Ezekiel in the myths of Ezekiel's vision this light that he saw coming above the four living creatures was yellowish green when he come to John he appeared in the Emerald which was also yellowish green he said he comes now to the Revelator in yellow screen now here's where he changes he said he comes to us in the yellowish green of the light he said walk in the light he is in the light sober man says whenever he would see the holy spirit move as a pillar of fire he said it's an amber color that Amber yellowish green sober ram connects the emeralds here in Revelation 4 he drops back five hundred years to zekiel said it's the same color he says the same color we see the he said is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen now barbra have said who is that man he said that man was the son of man see he said it was Christ hallelujah he said memmer that emerald color that's the color of light that's with the Lord he said it's the Lord's light that follows the Lord and it's as the Lord is amber yellowish green that's the same color of the light that's with us today as the scientist has took his picture yellowish green amber amen he said when I was a boy it was the same color when I seen it then he said I want you to remember he said God still exists in the same colors he said because it's been shot with a movie camera or a color camera today he said the Holy Spirit is still in his power still in his church in the last days he says there you are and then he points to the picture of the 1950 pillar of fire picture he said he said not me I was just standing there let me say it again not me I was just standing there right but it was a picture that was taken I want you to look at that just exactly what Ezekiel saw amen that's why that picture of the pillar fires so important I want them to make sure they emphasize that pillar of fire because that's the same thing Ezekiel saw Amen that's the same thing John saw the same thing brother Branham saw and God lets us see it today hallelujah and I would all acridness see it hallelujah I want all my family to see it I want everyone to see it to know that Jesus is the same pillar of fire today hallelujah glory now program says can you imagine that he said think of it we've seen that same pillar of fire today he said why can't I tell that the people why can't I make the world see it and he says the world wasn't meant to see it to see but we got to give the world a chance to see it right but we know not everybody will receive it he said but they can't see it it wasn't meant to them they'll never see it but the church is receiving the mightiest shaking it's ever had hey man Oh hallelujah he said then days the days of John and Ezekiel they couldn't take a picture of it now they can because they got the mechanical devices to do it amen and the ones who are trying to take mechanics to deny God comes right back around and proves there is a God amen like dr. Betts right he hired that photographer to try to prove there was no God and take a picture of brother Graham you know our picture of a doctor best of his fist under Bosworth chin they took it to disprove God and God uses it to prove that he's alive and well amen then brother Branham adds one scripture let's go to first John chapter 1 verse 5 remember this is just a short version of what he would preach but you can go back and listen to it if you like I just preached the things that I can prove in the scripture and that will help you just understand it to catch it first John 1:5 through 7 and Lydia can you read that when you got it first John 1:5 to 7 amen so brother Branham reads the scripture he says God is light he said God is light but man said God is eternal light that's light without ending right according to John after he had seen him in the vision so the scripture says he is eternal light and then I just added one myself because when in acts 9 3 when when Saul got knocked off the horse the Bible said something there Sean write about him a light from heaven same light same eternal light amen the pillar fire praise God all right thought number three that's the first thought on Jasper and sardine that's all I have from the scripture but like I said I'd like to preach more on that about the 12 stones but I mean a Jewish dictionary I'll tell you what I mean I'm gonna need a lot of scripture to teach that cuz I don't want to give you just Oh this is some doctors idea we got a note and then if it is Scripture it'll line up with everything else brother Branham said that's how you know it's the scripture because the Holy Ghost can't contradict himself all right now let's look at the rainbow yes the so verse 3 of Revelation 4 and a rainbow round about the throne now those are key words round about brother bran tells us now here's the first thing I'm sorry let me see if I got everything from the first thought just just a moment here seem like something struck me like I didn't get to okay no I got it okay yeah so John saw him in the mystery of his colors in light it's the same color as a pillar fire today like it in the fire right because Ezekiel saw he said there's he said there's amber he said then there's fire - hallelujah okay now the rainbow here's how brother Branham teaches the rainbow now we don't have to go there but Genesis 913 he said let's go back to when a rainbow first occurred here is Genesis 913 I do set my bow in the clouds and it shall be for a token a token of a covenant but twixt me and the earth so rainbow is a covenant between God and the earth and brother have said not God and Noah the covenant the covenant is not with God and Noah the covenant is with God and the earth praise God he didn't make a covenant with Noah it was to the earth and then he says and when it should come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen the cloud I will remember my covenant which is between E and you okay so that's the people and God now but it's the covenant between God and the earth isn't that interesting and that interesting that God sees the rainbow - cuz it doesn't let you know that God he's not a million miles away he's right here he's in another dimension but really close brother man makes it seem like that sometimes you know you got to fly past the Milky Way and all you might but if you do it's so close the Bible said he's so close from us he's not far from each one of us amen so see there God can even look and see there's the rainbow it reminds me of my covenant I made now we oh god I'll never forget it but God gives Noah these terms so Noah can try to understand what God is like and God said see when I see that rainbow it's a reminder of me of my covenant amen now Abraham said we find out then that a covenant is a token God said it was a token didn't he so token represents covenant and then but we know brother Branham preached later the token is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and he said it's a token of what a sacrifice has been accepted and brother mem goes to Genesis 8 and he shows how as soon as Noah went out of the ark what's the first thing he did it wasn't get drunk it was built an altar worship the first thing after that that long flood the first thing he does is he worships after he gets through the the tribulation after he's carried through the tribulation the first thing he wants to do is get us animal sacrifice it and say thank you lord thank you for bringing me through see he's trusting in his sacrifice he's trusting in the blood and so are we we're trusting in the blood tonight it'll be the first thing we do after a hard trial I'll tell you it all be the first thing we do in a hard trial amen it won't be the first thing we do before a hard trial is worship the Lord Jesus Christ and remember that his sacrifice of his blood is accepted by God amen now the next thing he says a rainbow is a covenant between God and the earth and all humanity not just Noah all humanity he says now the second thing we notice about the rainbow he said Noah and John both saw that God's covenant were accepted praise God so see Noah saw the rainbow there on the earth and we just saw it a few weeks ago my wife took a picture that was the most beautiful rainbow picture I've ever seen in my life that was beautified I know that was gorgeous huh and so Noah saw the natural rainbow but now John sees a rainbow as well and so bold proof that God keeps his covenant praise the Lord he said Jesus he said same thing that John saw John saw Jesus body God's accepted covenant surrounding in the heavens and he says around about the throne in the sight like an emerald and amber green light around the throne and he said Noah's rainbow consisted of seven colors how many other seven colors ROYGBIV did you learn that in school ROYGBIV okay it's red if you take that's an acronym red orange yellow green blue indigo violet those are the seven colors in the rainbow and brother Brown names them there he names them in the sermon and he said these seven colors he said don't you see God in His seven color rainbow his covenant that he made a covenant that through the seven church ages the seven colors he would save the earth hahaha glory God is going to save the earth the people on the earth through the seven church ages through the blood of His Son Jesus Christ that's the only way you'll be saving the church ages is through the rainbow colors of the seven Church ages the seven messengers the seven messengers of God's Holy Word oh that's beautiful hallelujah seven colors represent seven church ages that's how God is gonna save the earth amen oh I'm so glad to be saving this hour aren't you Oh hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus the fourth thing he says about the rainbow is this rainbow is not the same size or not the same shape as Noah's he said when Noah saw him it was half a rainbow right you go outside it well maybe it's like a little over half right maybe it starts to bend a little bit you know in their home or maybe not I don't know I wasn't look at the picture I can't remember but when you see about half of a rainbow but he said that's what Noah saw Noah and us today we see half a rainbow but brother them catches he said notice the rainbow John saw was an emerald color and surrounded he said the whole throne of God and he said it looks like a halo of light so it's not a half it's a halo like the halo around our prophet brother branham like that and he said notice this whole rainbow represents this he says the half has not been told about the glory of God amen you and I see rainbows but we just see half today so the rainbow the full rainbow around the throne means that we in heaven will learn all of God's mysteries throughout eternity praise God we're only seeing a half of it now or the glory and the crucifixion the resurrection the church ages you know all the Old Testament types foreshadowing Jesus Christ we're just seeing the half of it now but in heaven or we'll know who I have the hidden manna remember that we'll have the hidden manna the name written on the stone we'll have all this and God will make every mystery known to us but the half has not been told right now that scripture remember in he in first Kings 10 7 remember that when the Queen of Sheba came and she said this is so glorious that the half has not been told she's like my god that's such a glorious side the half has not been told and that's what we can say today hallelujah and I say like this that was a foreshadowing of the Millennium right because Solomon was the son of David the Millennium will be Christ as the son of David so we'll give the Millennium and we'll still say the half has not been told we'll have all eternity for God to reveal all was great truth to us amen because member church even the millennium it's going to be glorious but we will not be with all the same people yet if we have friends or family that did not receive the Holy Ghost they won't be there and still all the judgments haven't happen remember the white throne judgment is going to show everybody's life all their works and everything is going to be revealed there it's true in the Millennium the half has not been told we're just gonna have new homes the Bible said a child will lead a snake like a lamb you know it'll eat it in that striking I don't know how that's going to work the line will day lay down with the lamb all these animals will have their fellowship or the meat eaters will eat grass the line we grass the Bible said we're gonna build houses the Bible said you and I will rule nations if we got the Holy Ghost we will rule nations can you imagine and then the you might remember the population is going to increase increase because the Bible said a child will die a hundred years old did you know that there's going to be a population remember Satan comes at the end of that at the battle gog and magog he deceives all the nations and they rally around Jerusalem one more time but then fire comes down and destroys them isn't that interesting that's what the Bible says here but so see it's true even the Millennium that half will not be told but brother Graham said the Millennium so glorious you don't want to miss it oh ma you don't want to miss it make sure you get born again like we said on Sunday don't try to sneak in window come God's provided way say God I'll act any way you want I'll shout I'll scream I'll cry I'll speak in tongues I'll prophesy I just want the Holy Ghost amen if you come that way God will fill you amen Oh hallelujah glory he said the half see Noah just saw half because the half has not been told oh thank you Lord Jesus no brother branham the fifth thought brother ram breaks it about rainbow is that diamonds produce rainbows let me know that now can I get the picture here yeah it's coming up after this so this and I think that in the person was inspired because when you look at a diamond it kind of looks like that like little shapes inside of a diamond you know it looks like little diamonds there actually but bodiham tells his story he had an usher at his church who used to work in Africa at a diamond producing or diamond mining company and he said the rocks were crushed with 40 tons of weight from a machine and he said all the rocks were crushed he said but those diamonds the Diamonds the big thick ones he said would push that 40-ton crusher up so they couldn't crush the diamonds because the diamonds were so hard and he said but once they sifted through the rocks he said they had a little a little shelf and a little uh when they caught the line the assembly line that's what I'm trying to say assembly line something like that yeah and he said they got all the rocks wet he said but there was a little pad that had vaseline on it you can look it up another man said that he said meet it what's that word what are we got in the cabinet and she's at Vaseline he's got a Vaseline on it he said in all the wet stuff would pass smile the wet rocks it wouldn't attach he said but that the diamonds would be dry and so the drug the diamonds would attach to that Vaseline pad or whatever it was and then brother man makes that same he said but then after that once you had all the diamonds they needed cut in order to show forth their glory and then brother branham said see these diamonds were just one great big ball he says but when they cut it it's to reflect the fiery colors of its karat and it'll reflect seven colors also and brother Brahimi Thompson before he goes on he said make sure you find that jewel that diamond he said that diamond Jesus Christ he said it'll make a man sell all his wealth he's got and give everything away just to get that pearl of great price now I'm getting into pearls and diamonds but you understand he's the diamond of great price and then he said what was it here's the picture now I know gemologist okay like I told you that a few weeks ago I don't know nothing about gems I'm just taking their word for it so I could be totally wrong I'm just trusting that they got their facts right but here's my brother have said that great jewel what was it it was perfect he said God he said Jesus was 33 years old he said Jesus took 1/3 I'm sorry God took a 33 and a half year old diamond and God put it through the big bumping machine and then he took it over there and began to shape it and he cut it and he mashed it up and bruised it on Calvary day men he said he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we were healed so bananas that Jesus was cut on Calvary amen remember only a diamond can cut another diamond either so God in His Diamond character it was God cutting his Sun God was a because memory said you can't take my life I give it up he said pilot you could have no power except it was given to you by my father the mother man said what did God do to that perfect man there's only one of them in the world only one and that was Jesus God chiseled him off there he was wounded for our transgressions because I was a sinner listen God let the rainbow light of his seven Church ages flash upon me ha ha ha glory to know that he was wounded for my transgressions amen look what this says the way that diamonds reflect light is unique inside the stone the diamond will Sparkle gray and white notice brilliance well outside the gem it will reflect rainbow colors onto other surfaces so that's how you know a true diamond a true diamond doesn't have the rainbow inside of it the true diamond reflects the rainbow so it shines on two other surfaces oh that's how you know Jesus Christ is the true diamond of God when he was cut he shined the glorious light of the church ages and it landed on the surface of Adam rege oh boy it landed on the surface of Connie Clippers that right and landing on the surface or surface of Jose Lopez is that right it's shining now and it reflected and the light of Laodicea is shining and reflecting on you and I hey man that's beautiful that's the thought brother branham brings out of there so I thought I'd show you a picture see how it's shining out like you can see the rainbow can't you see the rainbow hope you can see the rim if not I need a better picture that's the best one I could get by the grace of the Lord so I can say thank you Jesus for being cut because your rainbow light is now shining on me and I'm walking the light as Lydia read as he is in the light praise the Lord okay let me let me bring this thought real quick if you listen to the the quote let me rightly divide the word of truth if you listen to this sermon brother Branham said these seven lights of the rainbow represent the seven fruits of the spirit did you catch that there's not seven fruits of the spirit there's nine so I just want to show you let's do a little exercise of rightly dividing the word because I had to do that on Sunday too I was just trying to show you you everything brother Branham says you have to take it back to the scripture if not you're just taking his word for it which is okay sometimes right I just did that tonight with Jasper and sardine eyed most the time but let's let's look at this just real quick cuz here's here's the quote what he says he said these seven spirits of God are the seven fruits of the spirit but you know if you count in your Bible let's count can we count one two three four five six seven eight nine there's nine fruits of the spirit so Church I'm not trying to be a smart aleck I hope you know that I just want you to understand when you listen to brother Branham you need to take everything he says back to the scripture so what if I got up here and said I preach my those seven rainbow cars represent the seven fruits of the spirit well that means you you're missing two of them you might not have meekness you might not you could use some deference you understand so I want to just show you this because later on brother BAM he corrects it in the church age book with the help of you know Lee veils writing but he said the seven spirits of God referred to the continuous ministry of the same holy spirit lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself very closely that's what the seven seven lights or colors represent seven church ages and each Holy Ghost ministry of each of the seven messengers does ever understand and people might criticize the same well brother Jesse or you're just trying to correct brother Brown no I'm not I'm trying to get all the proof from brother Brown oh I'm sorry all the truth I can from mother Branham but you at the same time he's human and if we catch a mistake it's not Oscar acting it's the Holy Spirit correcting him they understand that and I'll get the quote later brother Ram wants to be corrected if he's wrong and if you're wrong you want to be corrected if you're wrong if you're a real Christian but if you're prideful make-believe or prideful foolish version you don't want to be corrected but if you're a wise version the Bible said of a wise man you correct them he'll love you even more yeah and I've been misunderstood like I said mr. stone but understood by a couple people have come to me personally or email me personally about trying to make it seem like I'm trying to correct brother Bram no I'm not I'm just trying to take make sure everything he teaches that I and then I preach is going back to the Bible can I give you an example can I give you another example in the message the Feast of the trumpets program said that there's 7 weeks from Pentecost to Tabernacles and there's not there's more than that there's a lot more than that but bro Graham just makes a simple mistake and here he admits it he says like the other day I got something mixed up this is in questions and answers after he preached the trumpets I happen if you happen to hear I you said I caught it right there it's on the tape I'll probably hear from it which is good wouldn't you want if you preach three times a week like me you would want to hear when you're wrong so I can fix it the next time I don't wanna keep preaching the same thing over and over again and it's wrong I'd feel like a fool at the end of that I want to preach what's right how many wonder how many want to hear what's right let me give you a story one time so you'd have to read that just look at me just for a moment to tell you those story that's a lot of words he kind of you know it's just programs you know kind of going back and forth the reason this is important Church is because you remember how many member of the late James Browning he told me a story one time he said before when he was a young preacher he believed everything brother Branham said and never questioned it ever and brother Branham said when Jesus was baptized he said God said this is my beloved son and whom I'm well pleased to dwell in and brother Ram preaches it over and over again see he dwelled in and he dwelled in him and brother James heard him say that and he was witnessing to denominational preacher he said no God did well in Jesus because at his baptism God said I'm well pleased and whom I dwell in and the preacher said the DA Risha preachers said no that's not in the Bible and James told me he got all upset he said yes it is I'll prove it to you he said he went home he said a prophet said it if a prophet said that I believe it I see see how you gotta be careful he got all mad at the denomination and the denominational guy said he got mad too so he went home he looked up every time in the four Gospels of Jesus baptism and the Bible never says please to dwell in he said who in whom I'm well pleased but to dwell in is never in the Bible and I challenge you go home tonight read your Bible so now you have some spiritual homework if you want to and brother James said he was humbled because he he took something that was said and he didn't take it back to the Bible and he had to go back he said I had to go back to that denominational preacher and say I'm sorry I was wrong and he said it taught him to always of course we always respect God's servants brother Branham but it just teaches us everything he says is not thus sayeth the Lord most of it is but we've got to go back and make sure everything we believe is actually found in the scripture does everyone understand so see if he would if James would have done that he said he told me he would not had to apologise to the nomination preacher but Church James didn't that didn't bother James because a Christian doesn't mind being pretty corrected is that right to see that's why I'm doing this good if we take everything back to the word it'll save us from getting upset right it'll save us from saying something that ain't exactly right so that's why I'm trying to go through this because I'm listening to the sermon I'm going to preach it to you tonight and brother Ram said the seven colors represent seven fruits of the spirit but there's not seven fruits in spirit there's nine he has a preacher I have a choice am I gonna try to preach that and I wanted it any of you catch that when I first said it that there's more than seven fruits that anybody catch that I don't know but see the Bible the Holy Spirit would help you catch it later on sometime if you're reading your Bible does that make sense by God's grace so here's the mistake brother Ram said but there's seven weeks from Passover to Pentecost how we know that because Pentecost means fifty does everybody understand that and fifty forty nine seven times seven is forty-nine plus one more fifty so brother Ram in the sermon he said there are seven weeks from Pentecost to Tabernacles but there's wait there's more than seven because here here you have you know three weeks and then for weeks that's rt7 and then for more that's eleven and then for more that's like 15 so bro DRAM just made a mistake he was talking about this but he said from Pentecost to Tabernacles there seven weeks brother man makes a mistake a preacher caught it and corrected him and brother Branham says this I'm sorry next one brother Graham said Oh remember the Sheep turns into the loaf of bread at that time see when the Sheep of the sheep he says then all goes into one loaf it's a great teaching I didn't touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that mistake on your tape remember what does he say look in the Bible I'll church I hope you I hope you hug your Bible a little tighter tonight when you leave this place see when we really think we know something we got to make sure we really know it we got to make sure it's right in the Word of God see sober Adam says if I make a mistake he said that's fine he's I heard him pray 1961 he said Oh God forgive me for my many mistakes in 1960 he was humble he realized I'm just a man of course he's led by the Holy Spirit but God still lets us makes make mistakes to keep us humble now here's the quote where brother Graham would always like to be corrected a Baptist minister this is from who's this Melchizedek about this minister a few weeks ago come up in to my house and said I'd like to straighten you out on your Godhead sometime when you got the time what about the RAM say no I'd never have time to be corrected is that what he said get out of my house you can't correct me I'm the prophet of God look how strong I am I see visions you don't look was he prideful or humble humble there's my hour so let me set it for five minutes look how humble he is Church now a Baptist minister who doesn't know the message of the hour in 1965 he already preached his seven seals he already preached all those revelations and what does he say I said I got time next week now he said I got time right now because I want to be straight and we lay aside everything else to do it so see brother man time I make a mistake I need to lay aside for me - I need lay aside when I'm doing if somebody's got a question for me and I need to help answer that question if I possibly can if I've done something wrong he said mother Brad you teach there there's one just or just one guy he said yes sir he said well I believe there's one God but one God in three persons and brother BAM said he said did you just hear what you just said one God in three persons he said that doesn't even make sense and then he takes him through the scripture how it's one God you know not three three persons now does that help by God's grace so see even when you listen to every tape we want to make sure we want to take it back to the Bible okay cuz we don't save us it'll save us from having to apologize for making a mistake and also from exalting brother branham to highly making every word he said thus saith the LORD which is idol worship so I hope that helps you and I just thought it was so inspired I was listening that this morning when I was studying and I heard him say seven spirits and seven fruits of the spirit there's nine fruits of the spirit see that so that's what is that that's the Holy Spirit that's the thinking man's filter aren't you glad for a thinking man's filter alright let's finish up I got a couple minutes I just want to show you that's a little exercise and rightly dividing the word of God alright let me close with this insight like an so we're going back to that picture Rhoda has said the same thing that John saw now I read I read this earlier and around him was a rainbow about the throne in the sight like an emerald ambarish green light around the throne he said praise be to God he said see I'm sorry so so we see him in the circle bow of green amber color this greenish what does green represent life brother he talks about see green is evergreen all he stays green is life what does it mean that God has promised he took a oath back there in Genesis that he would no put no rainbow in the sky that he would no more destroy the world by water he also takes his Othon swears by himself and all the seed of Abraham it raised up and this world will stand all of its shaking judgments the judgments were going through on the future lessons we got coming we'll show you where this world will belch and turn into volcanic sand blow to pieces and upside down and everything he says oh how we're longing to see that day he promised that great millennium would come and another thing the reason he was surrounded by the rainbow is because he's a covenant-keeping god he will keep his covenant so God put a covenant or a symbol of a covenant around him to show that Christ is in the myths or Christ is in the very heart of the promise amen aren't you glad church every at the heart of every promise of God there stands Jesus Christ he is in the middle of every promise of God he's at the very center he's at the very core of every promise of God and what does the amber represent what does it represent life God's eternal life he swore by no greater so he swears by his own life amen and here's the last thing that's an or feet this is what I'm adding so brother Aaron didn't say this but look at this this is going to lead into the next sermon hopefully well maybe not the next one but one of the future ones look what emerald means in the Greek of emerald made of emerald a light green gem that represented Judah in the high priests breastplate and that beautiful emerald was Judas color

out of the humble tribe of Judah he loved the Lord tonight I'm finishing up with that by the grace of Lord we just pray for me pray for me that God will show me maybe some Jewish encyclopedia or
