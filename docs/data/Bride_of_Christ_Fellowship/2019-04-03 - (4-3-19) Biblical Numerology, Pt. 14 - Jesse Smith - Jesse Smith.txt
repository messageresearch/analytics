made no man or woman glory tonight but may all the glory go to Jesus and we ask all this in Jesus Christ's name and short said Amen praise God amen how did this think our Bibles let's go to Revelation chapter 4 I'd like to go back to the biblical numerology series I've been needed more time to study this so I had a lot of time this week because I'm on spring break now kaikki do me a favor can you run in my office and get my white adapter it's right on top of the printer I'm sorry I forgot that I got the other one from Sunday I use this ones Sunday no last Wednesday Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 we're look at numbers I believe 18 up to 40 today by God's grace if the Lord Oh help us now of course this scripture this passage is about the four and twenty elders so we're gonna work our way up to 24 24 seem to have a lot of a lot of numbers associated with it so we'll be happy to look at that here tonight we'll try to pull as much inspiration as we can from the Holy Spirit tonight by God's grace I got a good quote where where I'm said it's up to the pastors to teach you about numerology so I said well thank you lord I really blessed my heart he said of course your pastor will teach you that so I like to fulfill what he taught amen Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 we'll just read the first four verses I'll read the first three and then we'll read verse 40 again the revelation 4 verse 1 after this I looked at me hold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about throne in sight like unto an emerald now let's read verse 4 together if we can ready one two three and round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold amen they got as Mustangs the dreams word may be seen but by God's grace god bless you so I do have slides here I just had this thought let me pull up I want to pull up that quote for you I tried to find it last Wednesday about a year and a half where brother BAM preached on Revelation yeah here it is okay there it is this is from 1956 the time as they Hamburg Graham said and as we read this marvelous book of Revelation in my home church I've taken once almost a year and a half to go through it slowly each night teaching on just the book of Revelation and comparing it with the rest of the Bible and the ages and so forth that have passed on so don't you like that church that really is encouragement to me now I know this too brother Branham said however you would have acted in the days of Jesus is how you'd act now right so you say well I could have done that if brother Branham was preaching or if somebody else was preaching but no brother bam said Jesus Christ is the same in every detail today except the Corporal body how many under how many know that in other words there's Jesus Christ is here today he's on this earth he's in Akron his Holy Spirit's here and he's the same in every way except we don't see the corporal body that means however we would act would active brother branham's day is the same way we would act today praise God however you would act in the days of Moses or Noah whichever group you would have been in is the same group you'd be in today praise God so we need to rejoice in the fact that we can go through the Word of God just like brother Brandon and enjoy all the Word of God hey man hallelujah I just thought I'd share that I was on my heart to share this is part 14 I forgot to put the dates on there just put question marks in April so I forgot to do that this morning this is part 14 so we read our text now I want to quickly just go through these meanings again to refresh it with you because program said that's the pastor's duty so I like to do that real quick so number one is preeminence in unity to his division difference testimony and unity and friendship three is divine perfection in life for his deliverance a double confirmation and the earthly number five we've seen as Grace or favors also laboring grace and redemption six is fallen man and beast but it's also anointed man and it's a way to measure time seven is completion eight is eternity or the first day again or we might call it new creation new beginning or it could be abundance nine is fruit or consummation it's our consummation or it could be closure or judgment we've seen 10 is divine order or worldliness it can also mean a faithful remnant at times with the ten virgins and so forth 11 is this order or it could be the last call we've seen that with 11th our workers 12 is a government or rule it could also be worship but we're gonna find out today brother Branham says 24 is worship as well so that's interesting 13 is rebellion it could also mean victory or Revelation as we saw with Joshua making 13 trips around Jericho 14 it looks like a double 7 but seems to relate to generations we saw that a few Sunday nights ago 15 I'm not quite sure it does relate to feasts of course it's a triple five we know that 16 could be a double eight or eight times two oh I want to add this in here yeah so I looked it up in Hebrews 11 there's 16 individual names listed there seems to be a little bit of bit of connection for 16 there with 8 and charity and God's divine love able anak Noah Abraham and I skip Sara aside to go back Sarah's actually the fifth one which is Grace a woman of grace which we're the woman of grace Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses Rahab gideon barak samson jephthah they David and Samuel are the actual names listed 16 names but then there's if you keep going there's extra groups which make a total of 22 people Israel passing through the Red Sea Israel saw the walls of Jericho fall down Paul mentions the prophets he mentions all the women that received their dead to life he said others and then he said and others too so I don't really know the numbers for 16 and 22 I just thought I'd share them with you because I came across them this week so perhaps I said I believe this - I believe this as we serve God longer God will make more of these numbers plain to us I believe got to make it more plain like with 17 like when I came in the message I never knew 17 was the bride number but through Aaron and through some other ones studying we see 17 is clearly the bra number amen but remember 16 had charity had 16 attributes in Revelation 13 I'm sorry first Corinthians 13 there's 16 attributes of charity and then Jesus was raised on the 16th day of the month because the lamb was killed Passover was the 14th day 14 15 16 so there's something about that this hall-of-fame of faith with 16 individual names interesting now we know 17 seems to be Christ's bride sorry with Jewish bride in the day of Pentecost but then of course turned a Gentile bride later now 18 I think is where we're gonna pick up now by God's grace I'm unsure the meaning but it's 9 times 2 there was 18 years the woman had the spirit of infirmity before Jesus he owed her in Luke 13 11 and behold there's a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could no wise lift up herself and we know Jesus here this woman supernaturally now above injure the other book I've been reading and no examples of 18 so that's why that's quite short like I said we're spending probably most time on 20 24 and 30 probably and then a little bit on 40 19 unsure about 19 I found that the children of Naphtali inherited 19 cities and their villages in Joshua 1932 to 39 so 19 cities in their villages 19 just has a short example their Jerusalem was burned in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign just thought I'd put that in there Jeremiah 52 12 in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon I'm sorry yeah came Nebu Sarah Don captain the guard which served the king of Babylon in Jerusalem and burned the house of the Lord and the King's house and all the House of Jerusalem and all the house of the great men burned he with fire now let's take a little bit time on 2020 has an interesting pattern you can see 20/20 does signal expectancy or you're waiting for something from the Lord 20 deals with expectancy of course it's 10 times 2 or he could say 5 times 4 I forgot to put that one up there as well there's other factors right 220 now interesting Jacob was with Laban for 20 years I remember he was longing to go back members mother sent him away but member on his way there he had a dream right and the dream said God said I'll be with you but then I'm gonna bring you back to your land amen so Jacob was waiting 20 years expecting to come back to the land praise God he was waiting 20 years hallelujah that's interesting I've almost been the message 20 years I wonder if there be something special in the 20th year I wonder 2001 I heard the message so I just got a couple more years by God's grace 2 more years we'll see if something happens in the 24 20th year yeah now in this 20 years he reserved Laban for his wives and cattle so this is further on in the chapter he said I serve so 20 years of service and then he got us to wot two daughters of Laban and then six years for cattle has tile changed my wages ten times he said except the god of my father the God of Abraham the and the fear of Isaac I've been with me surely thou has said away now empty oh my god has seen my affliction in the labor of my hands and rebuked the yesternight so I'll say like this it wasn't easy twenty years and you'll see some of these other twenty years they're not always easy but I'll say like this God is faithful and God will show up at the end amen Jacob says without God's favor you would have to serve twenty years for nothing he said but thank God God was with me aren't you glad for God's favor Church you and honest let's be honest we don't deserve God's blessings but he gives us his favor raise God now interesting look at this Israel was oppressed for 20 years before deliverance came through Deborah and barrack 20 years very similar and the Lord sold him in the hand of Jabin king of Canaan that reigned in Hayes or the captain of the host was Sisera which Jeff which dwelt in Harrell Chef of the Gentiles and the children Israel cried to the Lord and he had nine hundred chariots of iron in 20 years he mildly oppressed the children of Israel amen twenty years and then God sent Deborah and barrack here's another twenty the Lord told Moses the number Israel beginning at the age of twenty so it's almost like the men would expect my when I get to twenty that's the time I'll start being a soldier so 20 was the year that of expectancy we expect you to be able to fight praise God so we expect you to go be able to labor now yeah now that you're twenty we expect you be able to fight any man with a sword or spear twenty years old this is interesting I'm not sure how this fits in but in Solomon's Temple that cherubim wings were twenty cubits long they're twenty cubits that's one really this is a cubit remember from your middle finger to your elbow that's a cubit so we're talking about some pretty larger angels right and this was remember showing this was the August time this was the glorious time of and this was showing forth that millennial reign praise God oh what a blessed thing is gonna be to live during the Millennium amen twenty cubits long oh look I had I had this up there twice sorry about that Sampson judge Israel for twenty years and they kept expecting him to do great things right against the Philistines but the greatest victory didn't come into the last year how many can say men of that like okay well waiting for Samson they're expecting Samson to do something you know a little few little things here and there but the Bible said his last victory was the greatest of all the victories so it took 20 years at the end of 20 years there was such a move of God where we could see now we can see why this man was born it took all twenty years we expected great things and it finally came in the 20th year Amen for he judged Israel for 20 years I like that so the dead which he's through at his death were more than they which he slew in his life praise God what a blessing that is praise the Lord right now the Ark of the Covenant was then here Jeff Durham for 20 years in the early days of Samuel until Israel started reviving this is interesting too now it didn't actually come into Jerusalem until 40 years later when David brought it in but once once Samuel came on the scene it was at the 20th year so they were expecting something to happen and then something finally happened in the 20th year and that was Samuel came on the scene and Samuel started judging Israel hey man oh yeah twenty years and all those years see they'll amenda they're expecting something they're crying into God God sent her something and so God did God sent him a prophet amen when noticin all these cases there's women Hannah was crying out to God give me us a son give me a prophet take my reproach away they they cry for twenty years God give us deliverance and God sent him dead Romaric amen so see church many these times the twenty here represents expectancy but the people of God have got to cry out for it amen 20 years of crying out to God and then the 20th year God sent a prophet on the scene oh my what a blessing is a faithful Church what does it show you this shows you that God hears all the prayers of his people but he may give you a little test right he may make you wait a few months weeks years decades Amen but the faithful God hears the cries of his children don't give up if you give up it shows you're not born again whatever you are born again it shows you're Abraham's seed and you can wait a long time amen took Solomon 20 years to build both the Lord's house and the king's house imagine the expectancy my when are we gonna get this done Solomon who boy oh boy seven years he finished the Lord's house they said Amen fire fell from heaven but now he's like oh I got to work on my house now that was thirteen years in the building and then five at the other twenty years they all finished at the end of all that labor 20 years he finished building praise God now this is striking this is what is really striking to me there's 20 dreams detailed in the Bible and that's striking so 20 represents expectancy and how many know once you have us real spiritual dream what happens after that what happens that we have that dream church you start expecting it to happen right remember I had a dream about brother Branham a couple years ago remember that and I shared a dream in the dream it was on Victoria's birthday so J in January 28th I woke up but before they had a dream and I was in a prayer and I went to brother Rams meetings and finally came up to my turn brother man looked like he's about 4045 something like that he stood some hair on top I said brother branham you know how come how come the churches and manifesting like the latter a Nia in the book of Acts church and you know I was really burden to see you know more of God and all the supernatural and program told me something that something like this he said well you need to spend more time seeking God about it and I think he thought he questioned me said how much time have you spent seeking God about it and I remember leaving the prayer line little disappointed but when I woke up I was so encouraged I finally had a spiritual dream but what it new replaced an expectancy in my heart because I said expecting if I seek God more I'll start to see more of God and in each one of these cases Church the dream is something spiritual and in many of them it creates an expectancy for God to move now the first one Abimelech had the Deadman dream he said you're good as a dead man he said but thank God you got a heart of integrity right Church look how look how look how straight forward God is sometimes we think God's like a soft dhoti grandpa right God's like you're as good as a dead man right he said but because you've got a heart of integrity I'm not going to cause your women to go barren right I'm gonna have mercy on you because you have a heart you don't want to sin against me so what would God say today to people that take a second wife and a third wife they say you're nothing but a dead man right that right church is he the same yesterday today and forever or not he's the same remember adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of God neither will men that a commit adultery in their minds all the time or women but thank God God knows our integrity God knows if you really don't want to do something like that God will keep you from it the second one is Jacob's Ladder dream promising is keeping from God also his return jacobs Rams dream was next telling him return to Canaan because he had all speckled Rams as God said look what I've done I bless you and laymen's dream next was to speak not to Jacob either good or bad Joseph's dream now this is a real expectancy right Joseph's dreams and all the the sheaves bowed to him when's this gonna happen remember it happened how many years was that later I can't remember now he started ruling at thirty seventeen okay so thirteen thirteen years later this actually happened well a little after thirteen yeah cuz he started ruling I'm not sure what year his brothers actually came to him so as at least thirteen plus years and then Joseph had another dream of how the son bowed to him the Moon and Eleven stars of course that happened a thirteen plus years later as well dream seven and eight were Joseph's dream of the the butler's dream and the Baker's dream and that would create some expectancy didn't they won't know what's going to happen I can live am I gonna die photostream of seven lean cattle devouring the seven fat ones was the eighth ninth dream his dream of the seventh in years was the tenth dream the eleventh dream was the Midian man's dream of the barley cake rolling down the hill and smashing the tent amen and that created such expectancy for Gideon he fell on his knees and started praising God right there I'm more than a conqueror we're gonna defeat these many knights God's gonna drive them all out by the power of God Solomon dreamed the Lord asking him what God should give him that's the 12th dream the 13 Nebuchadnezzar his first dream troubled him Daniel interpreter of the image of the the Gentile times the 14th dream was Nebuchadnezzar second dream himself as a tree cut down but then given life again that's when he lost his mind as a beast and God allowed him to humble him so he could expect a better end praise God Oh mine look how God's dreams with believers and even unbelievers look how God gives hope and expectancy with dreams the 15 dream was Daniel's dream of the four great in Daniel chapter 7 the sixteenth was Joseph's dream instructing him to take Mary and name the boy Jesus the seventeen was a wise man what warned of a dream not to return to Herod the eighteenth was Joseph's dream instructing him to flee to Egypt the nineteenth was his Joseph's dream to return to Israel Matthew 219 and the last dream record in Scripture was pilots wife suffered many things in a dream because of Jesus right look how God will give a test to unbelievers he'll send a little bit allow a little torment to come on them to try to shake them up but see even dreams sometimes how many people no even dreams won't turn people to God God will use a dream to try to shake them up but they won't turn to it god help us to humble ourselves and be moved by the dreams that we have we should take a church we should take our dreams as a warning is that right we should take our dreams if it's a scriptural dream now we should take it as the word from God and we should act upon Wheaton's you should do something about it amen now I mentioned this a few last Wednesday yeah let's no two Sundays ago when I preached when a man's sister was here Paul is 20 evil attributes for the last days talking about expectancy my expecting evil lovers their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers them that are good there's 1415 traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more numbers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof see they can expect the wrath of God because of these 20 attributes about them that's right and from such turn away a church that's what we should do we should turn away from people that say they are messing believer but they don't have the power of God in their life is that right amen turn away than from anyone that loves the world more than they love the message praise God turn away from that we must love the message first and then we must just live in laodicea Amen now 21 this is interesting there's just a few examples 21 seems to be all that makes sense if 20 is expecting 21 would be the arrival aim ahead I didn't catch that so right now forgive me Lord forgive me the arrival the word at 7 times 3 completion and perfection Oh glory when did Daniel's prayer come Church when the answer come 21st day hallelujah when the word come after 7 officers serve three weeks of seven days right interesting the Word of God came to Hagee I on the 21st day of the seventh month so I got two witnesses and then he said now be strong zerubabbel because the words arrived amen saith the Lord be strong Joshua son of josedech the high priests and be strong all you people the land sent the Lord and work Fri with you saith the Lord of Hosts boys thank you lord I was want to make sure I get this right yes the Word of God came to me when I was 20 21 years old I was making sure it came on Thanksgiving Day of 2001 and I was 21 years old well hallelujah thank you Lord the message arrived when I was 21 years old I don't know yeah thank you Jesus well he's just blessed in my heart amen thank you how merciful is the Lord praise God thank you Lord Jesus now 22 I don't have a whole lot on this that's why I put a question mark it seems to be disorder but I'm not sure Jeroboam and have both rain for 22 years a hab was the most filthy evil King so it seems to be a double disorder they have the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samara and two years remember Church on each one of these I typed in the computer you know ten and seven or you know for 1820 and 120 and 220 and 320 and for searching all these by the Bible to try to find try to find revelations for us so that was that 23 I'm kind of unsure but Nebuchadnezzar is 23rd year that seven hundred seven hundred five Israelites were carried away captive twenty three thousand I'm skipping a thousand twenty three thousand his rights fell one day due to Balaam and bailiwicks fornication focused feast right they said oh we're on the same come on over here and even if you're not married you can sleep with these people it's okay God will understand you maybe he'll plan to get married next time but God hated it and Bertram's said I listen to nobody I'm saying this this week he said God never did forgive them for saying they're all the same so don't you ever say the message churches are all the same as every other churches we're not the same we're living a separated holy life at least we should be praise God we're not to say God will never forgive those people who say we're the same now the way you know the way you know you're saying that is if you're sinning like they said when we let message churches sin the way the denominational sin and say nothing about it that shows that we're all the same but if we preach a higher life if we demand a higher life because God's Word says so because we know grace helps us to live higher and if you really receive grace you will live a higher life of sanctification when we live a separated life that proves were separated God called our group and a group that's following the pillar fire amen thank you lord amen all right should have totally different praise the Lord there were other people's lives look like hallelujah we're not the same as denominations yes we're all created by God yes we all have the same chance to be saved yes we can all be safe foolish you're wise but we are different people because we're living to please all the Word of God we're living all of it we just don't want to be called Church we want to be called bride amen thank God that we can be called bride remember the foolish virgin is not called bride she's not the bride because she's not part of the wedding in the sky but you and I are privileged to be invited to get married to Christ at that wedding supper and of course we know the invisible unions happened first but brother Branham literally says in 1965 he says the meeting in the air is the wedding ceremony amen that's right hallelujah so thank God if you got the invisible Union if you've got the invisible Union then you'll act like it you'll act like you're married right now and you won't compromise on God's Word amen hallelujah let me see if I can find that quote real quick it's been so long since I read that I like to show that to you yeah it's not the exact word sorry I look good maybe it's married Oscar take me too long help me Lord oh yeah this is kind of that's kind of like it yeah here we go but he's calling not a church group like I said the foolish version gerrae their church good which is a good group that's not the bride but a people for his name that receives his name listen this is what we have engaged you and I are engaged to his name going to a wedding to be married to him to become part of them see a predestination church where we going we are going to the wedding amen you see that we're going to be married praise God I thought there was another one but I should look at my notes I thought it was the exact quote forgive me but I think you can see we said we're going there we're going to the wedding you're yes you have the invisible Union but we're going there to be married because last time I checked when I got married I took my wife home and you see Jesus right here do you see the physical body of Jesus no but when you see that body that's when he gets married and then we'll be with him is that right we'll be with him glory now here we go 24 was a little more content on 24 as you can tell there wasn't much for 18 - 19 I was a little bit on 20 the most was on 20 now the 21 to 23 there's not much so 24 we have a little more now remember brother Adam calls 12 and 24 he calls both them worship and I looked up I try to look up every time now he said 3 is the number of perfection we all know that 3 is God's number in his numerology God is known by his numbers 3s perfection 7 is worship 24 is worship forty's temptation 50s Pentecost Jubilee so forth all of his numbers as numerals of God is perfected is imperfection now 3 is the number of perfection just when listen not close when the little baby christ is born three stars went together and made the one morning star that reflected the coming of an infant Christ a perfect one now this was our scripture there's twelve twenty four seats and there's twenty four elders in heaven and the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sound the throne and worship Him so brother hands to the 24 is worship Him that liveth for ever and ever and casting their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created now I just want to read these as a reminder because I preached on this recently last year now the four and twenty elders and outers an overseer now notice there were twelve patriarchs and twelve apostles and they were sending twelve on one side twelve on the other there were the twenty and four elders which were the twelve patriarchs on one side the Old Testament the 12 apostles estimate then Jesus say you'll sit on the twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel and how the foundations looked there was even a tree in there and the tree on either side bears twelve manners of fruit and they yield their fruit once a month which is twelve months in a year they render twelve manners of fruit every year as it goes by twelve is that worship number you see and there's a twenty and four would be twenty four twelve apostles and twelve patriarchs they're setting at the throne and the church said and we've seen this now here's the quote I was going to share with you through the Old Testament the New Testament day winding up which everything in the Bible by numbers is perfect in threes like Father Son Holy Spirit justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost water blood spear and all these things three sevens 1224 is forties fifties is God's numbers that you understand forty is this temptation 50 is jubilee and oh you understand those by your pastors so see this is why I wonder well why should I preach this and here brother man says you're supposed to understand those by your pastors so I thank the Lord thank you Jesus I can fulfill what brother man taught now here's another one did you know this David kept 24 soldiers on duty each month each tribe participated one month at a time meaning two hundred eighty-eight thousand soldiers were ready always to war year-round twenty-four thousand per month this was since first chronicles 20 71 I'm just gonna skip down here which came in and went out month by one throughout all the months of the year of every course were twenty and four thousand so David knew I've got to have twenty four thousand if I'm going to be safe if I'm gonna have protection I need twenty four thousand surrounding me and isn't that interesting his throne was surrounded by twenty-four thousand and the throne in heaven is surrounded by twenty-four of patriarchs they've been you like that amen hallelujah it was protection praise God its protection for worship now did you know this brother Branham says I wasn't in church till I was 24 years old he wasn't worshiping in church until he was 24 this is the church the Living God 1951 he said they went to no church at all separated my father mother both Irish Branham and Harvey they had no religion at all came down my I was in church of Dobbs 24 years old praise God how many knew that I know that that was something I learned I knew I learned today 24 years old he started worshipping see how see how numbers can mean different things to different people 21 means a lot to me because that's when I received the message 24 men laughter brother Graham that's where you started worshipping in the church so it's different for everyone aren't you glad God makes everybody's testimony special I like that now of course in nature 24 is important too there's 24 hours in a day as one earth rotation takes 24 hours so to get back to the same spot where you were it takes 24 hours to get back to it and also church is interesting brother Brad points it out numerous times God seems to work many times within 24 hours I'm not sure if you're aware of that but let's pull out some quotes so you can see this so many times and Brodeur has does a little Joe Kinnear says he says if we're supposed to be the seed of Abraham if Abraham could wait 24 years until God came and told about the next year 25th year he says why can't the seed of Abraham wait 24 hours he makes a little joke there right oh he could say amen to that if Abraham callate 24 years so God came and then the twenty-fifth year Isaac came why can't we wait at least a day for God to manifest his word praise God I would say God help me to be able to wait a whole day right amen god help me just be able to weigh today because there's numerous things in Scripture that happened within a 24 hour span of time I like this this is beautiful look at this if you accepted Christ sincerely and you believe it then brothers come in the hoist of Holies and they'll yield the fruits of the spirit in 24 hours the stick that was deadly blossom yoona blossoms and almonds in 24 hours let a man or a woman that don't believe in the supernatural let a man and a woman that can't believe the days of miracles let them hide behind the horse of hoist and the veil of God's Sun will drop between them in the world and less than 24 hours they'll believe every word of God's Word is the truth I know you praise God amen so burry him get this foundation from the Old Testament lay a dead stick there give it 24 hours and you watch it'll come to life amen how they do yeah because that's what the Bible said Moses laid up the rods for the Lord and Tabernacle witness and they came to fasten on tomorrow the next day 24 hours they went in behold it brought forth buds and blossoms and yielded almonds oh honey here yeah you see now just Mountain does anybody understand now how comes some people that come to message churches like ours they can stay here for out a year year and a half and then they fall away how come they can do that and not bear almonds or not bear fruit it's because they never went deep enough in God's presence they never went all the way oh god help us to go all the way men so we can have real fruit of the Holy Spirit so don't give up and get worldly or just get a church membership rather than a fruit producing experience with God Almighty hey man how do you praise God Day men had a good week so far church I've had a pretty good week I mean it'll pass out more of my books I gave a book today to my chiropractor yesterday my friend was sick he's had an ear infection we're in the middle of the Akron library now it's the Akron family center where there's all these people stand around and he said I've had this ear infection I said can I lay hands on you can I pray for you in Jesus Christ's name for all these people and so we prayed right there I'm trusting I'll hear a testimony of him being healed oh we should be walking this mirror charge we should be bringing forth fruit of the Holy Spirit we should be manifesting the life of Christ every one because if we met in his presence we will we've been the Friends of God and we've if we've gone behind the veil and been in his presence then we can't help but bear real fruit of the Holy Spirit publicly I don't you like that he goes on to say this this is the same quote he said but when to come to here and stayed in there 24 hours it was a yielded tree you fruits after it coming out of that holy place brothers sisters let me say this in the name of Christ if you've never been that place come to him tonight get into that place when you come home close the door tell your husband not to bother you too look how simple brother man thinks my if a dead stick can get in God's presence in one day why can't a dead sinner get in God's presence and bear for all kinds of fruit of the Holy Spirit hey man god help us to be simple minded like brother branham tell your wife and say I'm not going to come out if I got work in the morning tell the boss I'm not coming to work today if only it was that easy it is and stay in the presence of Christ until I like that until something happens in your soul that's what it is you won't have these up and down oh no can you say mentor doesn't that make you and then make you happy glory that's why I say you just take a day off just take a Saturday spend the whole day thinking God see if God don't do something special twenty-four hours there's something special remember like your next 24 hours goes from light to dark brand-new day something brand new God likes to move in 24 hours now I'm not gonna read all this course because I'm running out of time here this is the story of the possum honey knows how many hours that the possum sit there program said the pots of mother possum waited for its turn to be prayed for 24 hours mother Graham said and he said dear Jesus if you with your omnipotent power if you're concerned about a sparrow and this possum doesn't have a soul it's an animal you directed that old possum up here you and the Holy Spirit said brother branham you used her yesterday in a sermon and told what a real mother she was and here she wants to live her babies and you haven't prayed before yet brother man said forgive me he prayed for the possum he said instantly the poss and looked sat back up walked away and kind of waved its tail brother Brad I'm saying Thank You parson for praying for me how long did away 24 hours praise God let's keep these things in mind as we go on our way tonight right just give it a day we can wait a day can't we remember when Jesus cursed the fig tree but may have said they never seen any difference in the tree right then it didn't show any physical results now here's where you and I want to get it it showed no results but what to say no man Edith from thee the Bible said in the morning after they passed the tree as they passed by they saw it dried up from the roots and Peter said master behold the fig tree which thou cursed is withered away so within 24 hours after he spoke the word something happened and brother have said in 24 hours about noon the next day they passed by the same tree and in there they noticed that the tree began to wither and Peter said Behold the tree which thou did curse it's already withering from the roots Oh hallelujah god help us to have faith to wait at least a day Lord move within a day Granite Lord help me no brother man said when Josh would smoke to the Sun it stood still for 24 hours brother BAM said Joshua leader though God had to stop the earth from turning held it there by some powers own power that the world never turned for 24 hours till joshua vend himself upon his enemy he took the gate certainly did God is ever true amen and it hasted not to go down for about a whole day god help us the way a whole day praise God help us to be able to wait at least 24 hours see if God doesn't change something now huh me know this Abraham in Genesis 17 he prays to Almighty God and this is shoddy l/l shoddy or else Shetty I am to cause it in Genesis 17 God comes to Abraham and reminds him Sarah will have a child she will have it for you and he laughs in Genesis 17 programs say we find here how shoddy I the almighty shad means the breasts like a woman's breasts and he appeared him in the name of el-shaddai which is plural breasted on the breast he got Abram ninety nine years old walk before me be perfect believe my word just keep on believing I promise that seventy five here it is you've been 24 years now since I made you the promise what a comfort on that been to an old men ninety nine years old and his strength our God and here God super form and said I'm El Shaddai i i'm the breast of god draw your strength from me i am your strength how many are drawn strength from el shaddai add tonight hey men praise god ninety nine years old still drawn straight from el shaddai i he had seventy six more years to live praise God but he's still drawing strength at ninety nine years old hey then thank the Lord now 25 through 29 there's not a lot of meaning oh except I forgot 28 28 can mean life because like a woman's cycle and there's other twenty eighths there I forgot about those yeah I did forget about that now bubbling journey's book had no scriptures for 25 to 29 but we know Abraham waited 25 years Isaac arrived in the 25th year and of course five times five grace grace times grace 26 is I could find no 26 is in the Bible 27 you know there's 27 New Testament books which is 9 times 3 I don't think there was anything else for 27 no I could find nothing for 28 or 29 so god jump ahead to 30 we have quite a few things for 30 I believe now 30 stands for leadership how many know that 30s leadership in the Bible Jesus cry was 30 years old when God gave the leadership to start preaching 30 years old now a lot of people believe John the Baptist started preaching at 30 as well but there's not a scripture that actually says that but we know of course he was conceived six months before Christ Joseph was the same age 30 years old when he has finally exalted to the second in command right hand no Pharaoh David was 30 years old when he began to reign in Hebron right so 30 is a year of or that number of leadership did you know the Jewish priests enter the ministry at 30 years old they can fight at 20 the men but then those Levites that became in the lineage of Aaron arenites they could start ministering at 30 years old and Ezekiel's visions began at the age of 30 interesting now for me 30 was a great year - 30 was your brother cam came and preached just once more Lord and I looked back and that was the year where I saw the most miracles in my life and in my ministry was 30 years old so God started doing something great at 30 there and it's like he gave me like a great leadership of the Holy Spirit I feel like a great vindication at the 30th year of my life I already been preaching five years I started pastoring oh I'm sorry are they than preaching seven years as our preaching at 23 and that 30 year was a very special year probably the most supernatural year I've ever had I believe for as far as ministry so 30 men a lot to me as well now in judges 10 these are just some interesting scriptures Jer judge Israel for 22 years he had 30 sons that wrote on 30 ask coats and they had 30 cities in the land of Gilead 30 so that's interesting 30 30 sons 30 Colts 30 cities judges 12-8 is man judged guru sorbetto ham he had 30 sons 30 daughters and they took in 30 daughters from abroad for his sons any judged Israel 7 years so with these two of the years we can see how 30 is an important number for them so 30 seems to represent leadership now this is interesting I don't quite understand this but I'm just putting in there because it's 30 Sam's remember with Sam Samson told the riddle to those men he said when they saw him they brought 30 companions to be with him and Sammy and said I will now put forth a riddle if you can certainly declare it with to me within the seven days of the feasts and find out then when I gave you 30 sheets and 30 change of garments but if you cannot declare it to me then shall you give me 30 sheets and 30 change of garments and they said put forth that riddle that we may hear it and the spirit Lord came upon him and he went down to Ashkelon and through 30 men of them and took their spoil and gave them change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle and his anger was kindled and he went up to his father's house so I'm again interesting the thirty there something with thirty now here's where we get a little interesting the lowest level of fruitfulness for an honest hearted Christian is 30 fold so 30 times what you have remember there's 30 60 and 100 remember there's only two kinds of Christians right there's the foolish and they don't bring forth any fruit because their life gets choked out by cares of the world how many how many tonight are happy because you're not you're not mixed up with the cares of the world all you care about is Christ have anybody happy tonight for that yeah praise God amen remember there's only two kinds of Christians either you are bogged down by the cares of the world or your bringing forth fruit of the Holy Spirit love joy gentleness longsuffering aim ahead Alan ooh yeah but the lowest amount of fruit a Christian will bring forth is 30 so look at the leadership so every Christian who's born again the Holy Spirit has a portion of leadership 9 but then another group has a double portion of leadership that's striking and then the last kind has above 3 right cuz 3 times 30 is 90 my praise the Lord ah how many want to be led by the Holy Spirit well you got to become like a lamb then right we can say 9 lord help me to be a real Lamb of God so I can be led in such a way to bring forth a lot of fruit to the kingdom of God amen hallelujah so I don't want you to miss that one you know because how do you breathe air 31 glory I was thinking that you got like I wonder if brother Aaron's thirty years old you told me one time but I forgot ok the 19th ok phrase the Lord and so church this is encouraging let's say you know your past 30 or the young ones got a little waste of 30 little it'll go fast though you watch but see this is something we can all strive for god help me to take the leadership of the dove and help me to be a lamb to be led to bring forth fruits to God each one of us can take that attitude can't we teach me to be led so I can bring forth that's what I feel like you know writing the book doing the YouTube videos this is all me trying to humble myself so I can follow the leadership to be led to bring forth some fruit unto God at least a witness at least a testimony against people who hear it and won't receive it right just like the Queen of Sheba remember she's gonna be used she and then all the men of Nineveh are gonna be used against all the men of Jesus day praise God nah Gazi he's a little woman a little queen woman Queen Athena Sheba God's gonna use her to condemn all those millions of people with Aaron Jerusalem she crossed the deserts because of but there greater than Solomon she crossed it for a greater than Solomon right are you heard of greater in Solomon she just did it for Solomon but you could even cross the town to follow that rabbi when he preached to the temple she's gonna be used as a witness a church that's what you and I need to be we need to be witnesses to this message praise God if even if they won't at least we need to tell them at least we need to give a Bible give them a book give him a message book give them a link to the Internet give them a chance they hear this word that we loved so dearly and that we've left everything to follow and support this message amen hallelujah that's where I look at a brother here and I feel like I'm the I'm like one of these I'm just trying to just I'm not have to be a witness against people I would think of all these people have given the book to you of all these people that have seen heard preaching it and watch these YouTube videos there's not more that want to believe the message I got to remember I'm living in a day when there's few that will find it but I want to be a witness that Jesus can say but there's one little preacher there's one man of God who stood by it preached it you heard it you had a chance to hear it and he lived it and you got to be judged by his example I realize that might be part of our testimony your testimony my testimony but we've got to back up this message with all we've got amen because that might be what we're living for now betrayed by Judas for 30 pieces of silver did you know masters who slaves were slain by an ox were reimbursed 30 shekels of silver did you know that it's like Jesus they looked at Jesus at all he's just about the he's as low as a slave thirty pieces of silver wasn't that much money because a slave yeah that's how much replace of slave for so Jesus was sold for thirty pieces of silver like a slave that's interesting do you know Noah's Ark was thirty cubits high do you know Israel mourn for Aaron and Moses for thirty days a piece how about did you know for thirty days God gave Israel flesh until it came out of their nostrils after they complained about wanting to go back to Egypt nine thirty straight days and of course you know thirty days is the prophetic length of a month because in Revelation 11:2 there's 42 months that the Prophet the two witnesses prophesy which is 1260 days so each month thirty days makes forty-two months of the Ministry of the two prophets praise God all right now there's not too many meanings for 31 to 49 not too many I could find and I'm gonna finish up here in a little bit I wanna try to make it to 40 there's not too much in here to 40 okay have you enjoyed this tonight praise the Lord I've enjoyed it I had a good time studying up it was really good so there's no scriptures in the book for numbers 31 to 39 but here's the one I found in Proverbs 31 is a godly woman there's 31 sets of spinal nerves which the wood Brotherhood calls the woman the backbone so the spy in the backbone so those two kind of go together Joshua smote 31 Kings and Josiah was a godly man reign for 31 years so interesting just throwing those numbers around there now I can't quite see one new pattern other than the godly woman 32 I couldn't find any but 33 Jacob had 33 daughters and sons when he left Canaan to go to Egypt and David reigned 33 years in Jerusalem Jesus lived 33 years so you see kind of like a period of rulership there kind of like a season of ruler ruling their reign that might be the word 35 this the only one I found solomon's pillars were 35 cubits high outside of the house of God the house of God was 30 cubits high we saw that earlier when he had pillars outside that were 35 tall they were actually higher than the actual house itself 36 there was 36 men and Joshua's army were slain because of achan's sin so 36 men slain interesting 37 second samuel 23:39 said there was 37 mighty men of David 37 last year what that is 38 there's a man that had a disease of infirmity and jesus healed him after 38 days I'm sorry 38 years rather 38 years imagine suffering 38 years and jesus heals you 38 not sure why 39 this is interesting these two kind of go together there was 30 nine stripes in a flogging huh me knows how many times Paul got a flogging five times five times he was flogged 39 times because they they the the Jews believe the 40th would kill you so five times remember he said he was in death oft write death oft he was close to death very often this servant of God 39 stripes got him so close to death and then it's amazing the Paul himself wrote the law was supposed to be good but to me I found it to be death and there's 39 books in the Old Testament and that's striking 39 looks like close to death all right let's close to this 144 T represents a temptation we might say a test or persecution now I'm just gonna have time to start this I'm not gonna finish this one so I want to save a little bit for Lord winning Sunday maybe Sunday we'll be able to finish 40 all the way up because there's not very many after this one I've already kind of read ahead a little bit this might there might be one or two more sermons left maybe one more now brother Anderson I'm typing something notice God how he's done this three times I think I've already read this one yeah 40 is the number of persecution I'm gonna skip right to that one 40 represents the persecution Moses he said in 40 days Mose was tempted 40 days Christ was tempted you see God is perfect in his numbers he says it again three is the perfect number we know seven is completion forties the temptation 50 is a Jubilee you know the mathematics of the scripture remember Jesus showed how or shoulder how it's done 40 days of temptation he was tempted above any man that ever could be tempted in the temptation of Jesus Christ watch he showed us how it's done honey I'm remember that Jesus tempted three times by Satan and brother BAM said that was more temptation than any man has never been tempted with that means no man's ever been hungrier than Jesus no man has ever had any more riches tempted tempted him than Jesus right or no man's ever been tempted more to do a miracle than Jesus Christ those three right from miracle food or power never no man none of us tomatoes stand there and say well Jesus it was harder for me actually to go through this temptation no man well I couldn't overcome because they offered me ten million dollars Jesus as they know I was offered a lot more than that all the kingdoms of this world right he said no man has ever been tempted above Jesus Christ look he showed us how it's done how'd he do it by the word that's I done it for he was the word in Jesus and if you abide in me and my words abide in you you were back to the word again the word a promise what is the word of promise to every Christian greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world and how do you overcome not me but the word that's in me see brother Branham couldn't overcome by just being a prophet the Prophet had to have the word in him amen his life it wasn't easier for him to overcome it was just as challenging and he had to stand there and let the word abide in him and he had to quote the word in order to overcome that ought encourages that if he can do it we can do it as well Dayman in fact I heard a quote last week I don't know which sermon it was but brother Ham was saying he said it's a lot harder for me to find the will of God than it is for you did you know he said that he said I have to sweat it out harder than you and he said the reason is because on my ministry impacts millions people and he said you pastors you just got one church you got to worry about he said I'm influencing millions of people by the tape ministry he said I sweated out a lot harder than you do right god help us just be faithful with our little ministries right right and realize brother Branham had it harder than we do yeah he saw a lot more visions but brother ham tells us in that quote it was it those visions weren't for him all the time many times they're frail the other people but he had to find the will of God he had to know what to do next what's the next move do I move out west what do I do he had to find the will of God and he said I got to sweat out a lot harder than you sweat it out see the word is God then I overcome the things of the world because the words in me if you buy to me my words abide in you then ask what you will yep just keep pressing up you're coming up to the top it sure as can be you've got you got to come to the top how many want to come to the top you want to rise above let's stand to our feet I'm gonna stop right to me that's my last one yep I need to add the scriptures there's a lot of 40 scriptures in there let's stop right there by the grace of God and I want to close that that'd be a good place to close I'm gonna try that quote - oh yeah it's taking yeah there it is ad listen that last week yeah brother BAM said this is taking sides with Jesus 1960 to Malachi you come to the piano you say well that ought to be easy for you brother branham anything to do god just tells you he said no he doesn't I sweat it out just like you do and a whole lot harder sure I have to sweat it out much harder than you do right some in church let's be honest how many have ever thought you'd have to raise your hand I don't ever thought oh brother BAM how had a lot easier than I do I'll be I'll be honest I thought that many times well brother Aaron also had to do he just had to have a vision and he he
