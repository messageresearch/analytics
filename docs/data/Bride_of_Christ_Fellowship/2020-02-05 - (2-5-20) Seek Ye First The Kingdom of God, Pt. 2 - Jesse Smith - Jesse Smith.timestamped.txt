[28:43] chapter 6 I'd like to kind of go back to
[28:47] the New Year's Eve topic of seek ye
[28:49] first the kingdom of God I want to
[28:50] preach maybe one more message on that
[28:53] this week I've been awful busy at work
[28:55] there's been a lot of grading and a lot
[28:57] of work to do there so I haven't had as
[28:59] much time to get into the approve all
[29:00] things
[29:01] topics but Lord willing next Wednesday
[29:04] maybe or the Sunday after we'll be able
[29:05] to get through back to that Matthew
[29:08] chapter 6 verse 33
[29:28] Matthew 6:33 praise God let's read verse
[29:38] 33 together on three one two three but
[29:43] seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
[29:46] righteousness and all these things shall
[29:49] be added unto you
[29:51] praise God they God has blessed in rivas
[29:53] work you may be seated praise God
[30:01] God's grace would like to look at this
[30:03] thought on seek you first the kingdom of
[30:05] God and hope is it on okay so that means
[30:14] the batteries are out so forgive me let
[30:16] me switch the batteries real quick good
[30:28] we in the House of Lords night with all
[30:29] the Saints praise done right now should
[30:35] be on now okay thank you Thank You
[30:39] faithful Jaden oh he's good at
[30:41] correcting in there and getting me on
[30:42] that getting a receiver on so let's look
[30:48] at C key first part two I wanna you know
[30:51] I never really dealt into the Greek
[30:53] meanings here so I want to kind of look
[30:54] at this and then tie in some other
[30:56] thoughts about seeking God first and
[30:59] just kind of one I'll put them together
[31:01] here tonight if I can by God's grace I
[31:04] like to try to do that so I have five I
[31:10] have five views on my Billy Paul Joseph
[31:13] video I only gave it out to three people
[31:14] so you know to Jose Jose want to watch
[31:17] it I give out to Billy Paul and Joseph
[31:19] Brennan and voice of God so haven't
[31:21] heard back from anybody yet but I
[31:22] imagine I sent the letters on Saturday
[31:25] so Saturday Saturday Monday Tuesday
[31:28] Wednesday so I'm sure they arrived by
[31:29] now
[31:30] I sent paper letters as well so
[31:33] hopefully there'll be a blessing and
[31:34] help to our brothers and the whole
[31:36] movement over there if not I did my part
[31:39] that's why I preach it so hard the way I
[31:41] do cuz I believe it's right and if I was
[31:43] wrong oh and I say on the video please
[31:46] correct me if I'm wrong cuz I want to be
[31:48] corrected but RAM said I always have
[31:49] time to be corrected so that's how we
[31:51] want to have that same attitude you want
[31:53] to be corrected if if we're wrong by the
[31:56] grace of the Lord now let's look here
[31:59] let's stay in Matthew 6 and we'll look
[32:03] to the scriptures here to guide us here
[32:06] I want to begin back at verse 25 Matthew
[32:11] 6:25 to kind of get the context of this
[32:15] again very familiar maybe to us but in
[32:22] 25 Jesus starts speaking about natural
[32:26] needs and so I want to look at that look
[32:30] at the natural needs and I'm just
[32:32] looking up real quick there's one -
[32:35] there's only three times in chapter 6
[32:38] Jesus says the word kingdom so I want to
[32:40] just get to that in just a moment but in
[32:43] verse 25 jesus begins dealing with
[32:45] anxieties we go through as humans right
[32:49] these are anxieties and Jesus is telling
[32:53] us to trust in the father's care right
[32:56] we are going to suffer anxieties and
[33:00] human-human
[33:02] times of questioning and uncertainty but
[33:05] Jesus is telling us the cure there is a
[33:08] definite cure from having anxiety and
[33:12] Jesus tells us it right here because
[33:14] verse 25 he said therefore I saying to
[33:16] you take no thought for your life what
[33:18] you shall eat or what ye shall drink nor
[33:21] yet for your body what ye shall put on
[33:23] is not the life more than meat and the
[33:26] body than raiment behold the fowls of
[33:30] the air for they sow not neither do they
[33:31] reap nor gather into barns yet your
[33:34] heavenly Father feedeth them are you not
[33:36] much better than they which of you by
[33:39] taking thought can add one cubit unto
[33:42] his stature so who is ever worried about
[33:45] these things and ever got that got what
[33:47] they needed Jesus said nobody's ever
[33:49] done that you cannot add anything to
[33:51] yourself
[33:53] and why taking thought for the raiment
[33:55] consider the lilies of the field how
[33:57] they grow they toil not neither do they
[33:59] spin yet I say unto you that even
[34:02] Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
[34:04] like one of these wherefore if God so
[34:08] clothe the grass of the field which
[34:10] today is and tomorrow is cast into the
[34:14] oven shall he not much more clothe you O
[34:17] ye of little faith
[34:20] therefore take no Thought saying what
[34:22] shall we eat what shall we drink or
[34:24] wherewithal we be clothed now he keeps
[34:27] naming these same three food drink and
[34:30] clothing he's naming those three over
[34:33] and over again food liquid water right
[34:36] and then clothing and he he starts
[34:40] dealing now he says why and then in
[34:41] verse 31 why do you why take no thought
[34:44] don't worry so much about these verse 32
[34:47] for all these things for after all these
[34:50] things do the Gentiles seek so we should
[34:53] be able to look at any sinner who
[34:55] doesn't know Jesus Christ a Gentile and
[34:57] we can see their lives are gonna focus
[34:59] on those three things right food drink
[35:03] and clothing that's there we're gonna be
[35:05] their main focus now behind all that of
[35:07] course to get those things that need
[35:08] money so behind all that many times is
[35:11] seeking after money and it's not sin to
[35:16] have money it's just sin to love money
[35:18] right there's a lot of money is the root
[35:21] of all evil so we look at sinners and we
[35:24] see that many times seeking after these
[35:27] natural things he says for your heavenly
[35:30] Father knoweth that you have need of all
[35:32] these things now in our MRR in armed
[35:37] immature prayers you know we made we may
[35:40] utter something like this like Lord
[35:41] don't you know I need this have you ever
[35:43] ever uttered that immature prayer Lord
[35:46] do you no good
[35:47] like like no you know David did many
[35:49] times right and another ones too but you
[35:51] know they have an excuse they couldn't
[35:52] get the Holy Ghost if we got the Holy
[35:54] Ghost we should be solid praise God
[35:56] right but but there's times you know
[35:58] when we we may pray with sin in maturity
[36:00] or maybe so we're in a moment of battle
[36:03] of the trial moment of weakness and we
[36:06] Lord don't you know what I'm going
[36:08] through it and of course the Heavenly
[36:10] Father knows what we're going through
[36:11] if anybody knows jesus knows amen for
[36:15] you is tempted in all points like as we
[36:17] are tempted but Jesus tells us here your
[36:21] father knows that all these things that
[36:24] you need so the cure for anxiety is in
[36:28] the next verse the one of our text and
[36:30] it is to trust in the father's care by
[36:34] seeking the kingdom of God first he says
[36:39] but seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[36:42] His righteousness and all these things
[36:45] shall be added unto you
[36:47] so Jesus says there's one cure for every
[36:50] anxiety and that is seek God and seek to
[36:55] obtain his righteousness if we seek God
[36:58] and we partake of his righteousness then
[37:01] Jesus says everything else will be added
[37:04] to you and we should have Saints here
[37:06] today that say Amen I'm a witness that's
[37:08] right
[37:09] hallelujah verse 34 take therefore no
[37:13] thought for the morrow for the morrow
[37:15] shall take thought for the things of
[37:17] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[37:20] evil thereof so our thoughts should not
[37:24] even be worrying so much about tomorrow
[37:27] right
[37:28] seeking tomorrow's food tomorrow's water
[37:31] tomorrow's clothes our mind should not
[37:34] be so much on seeking those until first
[37:38] we've sought God for His righteousness
[37:41] so that's the that's the cure for any
[37:44] anxiety or or any troubling in our lives
[37:48] is we have to first seek God's kingdom
[37:51] and then his righteousness and then he
[37:55] promised I'll take care of everything
[37:56] else if you can just focus on my kingdom
[38:00] focus on receiving from me I'll take
[38:04] care of everything else that seemed like
[38:06] a wonderful deal to you Church you just
[38:09] he said you just focus on one thing and
[38:11] I'll take care of everything else amen
[38:13] what a deal praise God what a great meal
[38:16] amen you take care of the one I'll take
[38:18] care of the three praise God
[38:20] because again he can't force anybody to
[38:22] be safe he can't force anybody to come
[38:25] after him we know we did not seek him he
[38:28] sought us first praise God we know that
[38:31] but yet with our free more agency I keep
[38:34] coming back to this in my studies with
[38:36] the three more agencies giving us the
[38:38] freedom to choose and we must take
[38:41] advantage of that freedom he said seek
[38:46] ye first the kingdom of God now this is
[38:50] a beautiful scripture now I want to
[38:51] bring in here earlier in the chapter so
[38:55] if you go back to verse 1 Matthew 6:1
[38:57] Jesus is continuing the Sermon on the
[38:59] Mount where he is being being the
[39:01] lawgiver right
[39:02] he is the anti-type of moses moses i'm
[39:05] just read last week
[39:06] Moses went up to the mountain he was in
[39:08] the face of God he came down his face
[39:10] was so bright right he brings a new law
[39:12] he asked the veil his face to talk to
[39:15] his brethren he can't even talk to his
[39:16] brothers unless he bails his speech but
[39:18] once he leaves his brothers he can take
[39:19] the veil off he could go back up to God
[39:21] and be in God's presence amen and then
[39:24] when he first brought the law down
[39:26] Joshua was like I hear the noise but
[39:28] it's it's not the sound of worship it's
[39:30] not the sound of war and Lois is like
[39:32] that's the sound of demon worship you
[39:35] know that's the sound of idolatry right
[39:37] that's a sound of parties and laughter
[39:39] and drunkenness and whatever Ravalli it
[39:42] would be and so we get so mad he throws
[39:44] down the stones right he throws down the
[39:46] stones and showing that the laws broken
[39:49] before they can even get it praise God
[39:51] humanity breaks the law before they can
[39:53] even receive it under the Old Testament
[39:55] without a change of heart there's no
[39:57] need for the law right but what we need
[40:01] is a changed heart ain't it and then we
[40:03] got a new heart then God can write the
[40:05] law upon our hearts amen
[40:06] and once the laws on our hearts we don't
[40:09] need the the stone law so much we don't
[40:11] know we thank God for the paper love it
[40:13] but it's not so much about the paper law
[40:15] as it is about the law of the spirit
[40:18] that guides us every day praise God
[40:20] thank the Lord and so that's what we
[40:24] were seeing in Moses he was a type of
[40:26] the true lawgiver
[40:28] who was going to come down and yet find
[40:30] us in idolatry but he wasn't going to
[40:32] get upset he was
[40:34] to give us mercy because Jesus was full
[40:36] of grace and truth they met he was full
[40:39] of grace Moses thought so much she
[40:40] wasn't full of grace like Christ was but
[40:43] Christ was full of grace while we were
[40:46] yet sinners he died Christ for the
[40:48] righteous right the righteous for the
[40:50] unrighteous amen and so Jesus is the
[40:55] anti-type he comes not just out of the
[40:58] Friends of God he comes out of the
[41:00] throne of God amen amen
[41:03] he's then come out of you know mouths
[41:05] I'm out sign that he came out of heaven
[41:08] praise God amen
[41:09] he left it let this heavenly throne
[41:11] praise God and church huh me know Jesus
[41:14] was veiled from the presence of God just
[41:17] as Moses had to be veiled Jesus was
[41:19] veiled what was it the logos the Holy
[41:22] Spirit was veiled behind human flesh
[41:24] hallelujah amen ha ha thank the Lord and
[41:28] so he comes down bringing the real law
[41:31] we've seen a few weeks ago with brother
[41:33] Troy even preach on it and I preach on
[41:35] it where Jesus cries eyes that anyone
[41:37] who's thirsty come and then a drink of
[41:39] the waters of life there is the lawgiver
[41:42] offering the Word of God the law to
[41:45] report into the hearts of hungry and
[41:47] thirsty souls
[41:48] that's our gracious Lord hallelujah and
[41:53] I'm outside a gives us the Beatitudes
[41:55] and then he tells us we're salt of the
[41:58] earth light of the earth
[41:59] we're cities let your light shine and
[42:02] then Jesus gives a new law and verse 17
[42:04] a new relation to the law in chapter 6
[42:07] I'm sorry chapter 5 rather and then he
[42:10] gives new light on marriage and divorce
[42:11] right greater revelation in chapter 5 31
[42:16] and how to deal with men in later verses
[42:21] and then he closes chapter 5 by saying
[42:24] be thee therefore perfect even as your
[42:26] father which in heaven is perfect
[42:29] praise God so if Jesus has programs in
[42:32] the Hebrew series if Jesus asks us to be
[42:34] perfect he's got to make a way for us to
[42:36] be perfect and member that's what Paul
[42:39] wrote in Ephesians he said I wish that
[42:41] all the Saints could comprehend the
[42:43] height and the depth and the breadth
[42:45] and the length of God's love amen Oh
[42:48] leaving just kind of catch a glint of
[42:50] that tonight how much God really loves
[42:53] us amen
[42:54] oh my that was Paul's great riding there
[42:57] to the Gentiles and Ephesus if you could
[43:01] just comprehend with the Saints the
[43:03] depths of God's love and Paul said who
[43:06] could separate us from the love of
[43:07] Christ amen
[43:09] so see we're perfect by the blood of
[43:11] Jesus Christ were forgiven and made
[43:14] perfect right like we know a job how in
[43:17] and in heaven
[43:20] job was perfect by the blood but on
[43:22] earth he still he still fell short but
[43:24] God looked at him as a perfect man
[43:26] praise God God looked at him as a
[43:28] servant right Moses lied twice you know
[43:32] he lied to the two kings he lied about
[43:35] Abraham's Arab sorry Sarah not meanness
[43:38] his wife and yet God had the kings as
[43:42] for forgiveness because God saw Abraham
[43:47] in his finished condition in his perfect
[43:48] condition praise God as a father of
[43:51] faith amen
[43:52] God saw the condition of Abraham as he
[43:54] would be willing to sacrifice even his
[43:57] son Isaac in order to honor God and God
[44:00] considered him righteous even before he
[44:03] did that because God looks at us as our
[44:06] finished condition amen oh yes the love
[44:12] of God God's love considers us perfect
[44:17] and then
[44:19] Chapter six now he begins with alms
[44:21] which are private gifts of charity to
[44:26] people he tells us we should give alms
[44:28] and then he get breaks in the prayer and
[44:32] verse 5 when you pray don't be as the
[44:34] hypocrites that love to stand the
[44:35] synagogues he tells us how to pray go in
[44:39] the closet seek the Lord
[44:42] you're not heard by the number of words
[44:44] that you pray and then in verse eight he
[44:48] breaks into teaching us how to pray and
[44:51] this is where he mentions the kingdom in
[44:53] the chapter so we often remember you
[44:57] know Matthew 6:33 seek ye first the
[44:59] kingdom of God but Jesus actually
[45:01] mentioned the kingdom earlier in the
[45:03] chapter praise God and he tells us to
[45:08] pray for the kingdom so let's read at
[45:12] Matthew 6 verse 9 after this manner
[45:17] therefore pray ye our Father which art
[45:19] in heaven hallowed be thy name thy
[45:21] kingdom come thy will be done as it is
[45:26] in heaven
[45:27] hallelujah give us this day our daily
[45:29] bread forgive us our debts as we forgive
[45:31] our debtors and lead us not into
[45:33] temptation but deliver us from evil
[45:36] in other words lead us not into a joke
[45:38] type of situation but deliver us from
[45:40] that evil for thine is the kingdom and
[45:43] the power and the glory forever amen
[45:47] so notice jesus' prayer about the
[45:50] kingdom we are to pray let the kingdom
[45:53] of God come that's what we just saying
[45:56] about that lift Oh gates see the kingdom
[45:58] it is here now let it come now
[46:01] praise God let the kingdom come now
[46:04] that's what he says let your kingdom
[46:06] come and then he says as we pray for
[46:10] thine is the kingdom it's your kingdom
[46:12] we're just playing a part in the kingdom
[46:15] program to just humbles himself and says
[46:17] I'm just one little pebble on the beach
[46:19] of the kingdom right if the kingdom is a
[46:22] beach he said he's a little pebble now I
[46:24] think he's bigger than just a little
[46:25] pebble but the point is that we're all
[46:28] playing a part in God's kingdom
[46:31] so those
[46:32] three times in the one chapter Jesus
[46:35] mentions the kingdom of God we're to
[46:38] pray for it now you probably remember
[46:42] this hopefully maybe Kingdom means
[46:46] Dominion or rule so he said let your
[46:50] Dominion come let your rule come right
[46:57] so we're to pray let your rule come
[47:02] we're the praying that God let your rule
[47:07] dominate our lives can say like that
[47:10] let your rules let your spirit dominate
[47:14] our lives and let it not just stop with
[47:17] our lives then it spread to others lives
[47:22] now this is quite a this is a two-fold
[47:25] statement I believe I'm sorry two-fold
[47:27] application because he says let us seek
[47:31] you first the kingdom of God now you're
[47:33] supposed to seek the kingdom the rule of
[47:35] God right in your old life but also in
[47:38] the lives of others this has to be an
[47:40] inward seeking for God to rule more of
[47:44] your life because Luke 17:21 says the
[47:47] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[47:50] so he says seek ye first the kingdom the
[47:53] Dominion of God and Jesus says the
[47:55] Dominion of God is inside of you so
[47:59] we're all pressured to get the food the
[48:01] drink and the clothes and Jesus says
[48:03] don't seek that so much he said seek to
[48:07] be ruled by my Holy Spirit and if you
[48:12] let yourself be ruled if you constantly
[48:14] get your eyes on Lord take more
[48:16] rulership of my life help me to submit
[48:18] to you and by doing that he said if you
[48:21] just take care of that and let my
[48:22] kingdom come into your life I'll take
[48:24] care of the natural things you just take
[48:26] care of the spiritual kingdom you be
[48:28] concerned about the rules the Holy
[48:30] Spirit in your life and your family in
[48:32] your church and they'll take care of all
[48:34] the natural things that's the promise of
[48:38] God that's just as that's just a bunch
[48:40] of promise as John 3:16 hey Lord how
[48:44] many like John 3:16
[48:46] Laurie it's just a bunch of promise as
[48:48] acts 2:38 hallelujah very man if we seek
[48:55] the rule of the Holy Spirit Jesus will
[48:58] add every natural thing that we need now
[49:02] let me go back to the word seek this is
[49:04] a beautiful word on this way I want to
[49:05] read the Greek to it like I said I want
[49:07] to spend a few minutes on the Greek here
[49:08] tonight by God's grace the word seek is
[49:12] zto now has a different Hebrew
[49:15] pronunciation I'm no Hebrew scholar but
[49:18] it means to seek for to aim at aim you
[49:24] know I had a everybody had to aim today
[49:26] right I had to aim at work I had to get
[49:27] the reading test grade that was my kind
[49:29] of aim I had to teach a little lesson on
[49:31] math had to do teach a little riding
[49:33] lesson I how to aim right and everything
[49:36] all these all the arguing going around
[49:38] all the upset children at each other and
[49:41] all the water spilling and all that was
[49:44] distracting from my aim right and I had
[49:47] to battle to keep that aim right that's
[49:51] I'm seeking I was seeking to accomplish
[49:52] all these things gotta help that guy he
[49:55] missed a spelling test last week she
[49:57] missed the reading test I gotta aim I
[49:58] all these aims aiming for all that to
[50:01] get all that done but there's so many
[50:03] other things that could distract from
[50:06] that and so even today at work you so
[50:09] think about your day what was your aim
[50:10] put on the table right get to school
[50:12] done and get at the hair comb and get
[50:15] the hair brush and everything there's
[50:17] all these aims to get it to get
[50:20] everything accomplished which is good we
[50:21] ought to do all that but the word seek
[50:24] here for the kingdom of God means that
[50:27] aim for to strive after to require
[50:32] demand and Octus word to crave to crave
[50:35] or desire so in other words Jesus saying
[50:40] aim first for my kingdom let that be
[50:45] your first aim the first one I look you
[50:48] got other aims right later for Brett
[50:49] gotta aim for breakfast you gotta aim
[50:51] for lunch you gotta aim for supper gotta
[50:53] aim for Wednesday night Church but the
[50:55] first aim of the day praise god no
[50:59] first I must be the kingdom the rule of
[51:02] God's Lord amen
[51:07] crave the first craving of the day or
[51:15] the first striving the thing you're
[51:16] gonna first try to strive to get is for
[51:19] the kingdom of God Jesus saying crave my
[51:21] kingdom praise God
[51:25] now where does the craving come from
[51:28] memmer brother Han tells us he brother
[51:30] Adam tells us you and I live in the
[51:31] control tower right I'm sorry in the in
[51:34] the mine we live in our minds right with
[51:36] it right here this our consciousness
[51:38] right our human spirit this is where we
[51:41] most often live everyone else that we
[51:42] live in the mind but we get we get
[51:44] desires from our body right
[51:48] you get desires waves messages from your
[51:51] body I'm thirsty thirsty give me water
[51:54] give me coca-cola got ignore that one oh
[51:59] you gotta gotta feed me I'm hungry you
[52:02] get all these messages from the flesh so
[52:03] we're here right in the middle our
[52:05] consciousness is in the middle okay I
[52:07] got messages from my flesh I need to
[52:10] feed it I need to do this I need to get
[52:12] at the red I can get it to sleep get
[52:14] some aspirin I get some get some
[52:16] medicine you have all these messages
[52:18] from your flesh but also church my man
[52:21] says you got you got a messages from
[52:23] your soul praise God amen so my man said
[52:26] you got desires from your flesh and you
[52:28] got desires from your soul but your mind
[52:30] is here in the middle your human spirit
[52:33] and you've got the meat you got to
[52:35] respond to both the needs I hope that
[52:39] helps you by God's grace jesus said seek
[52:45] ye first now where does the seeking come
[52:47] from the seeking must start in the mind
[52:49] it starts in the mind that's why the
[52:52] Bible said transform the renewing of my
[52:54] you be transformed by the renewing of
[52:56] your mind and that's why the Bible
[53:00] the first bet the first part of the
[53:01] armor is the belt the belt of truth
[53:04] right so we got to get our thoughts as
[53:08] soon as we get up we got to get our
[53:10] thoughts focus on the truth and get
[53:13] ready for battle right
[53:16] even if we're tired and don't feel like
[53:18] it if not Church you're gonna lose the
[53:21] battle and the church said if you don't
[53:25] give that mind settled on truth right
[53:27] away you are gonna get whipped in the
[53:29] battle Satan knows that he's right is he
[53:32] evil demons watch us do we get up right
[53:35] away and we get ready for battle through
[53:37] getting our mind right and that looks
[53:40] different for me as far as like my wife
[53:42] my wife has to get up with the children
[53:43] so her getting her mind right looks
[53:45] different than me I'm all alone I don't
[53:49] have children crawling all over me like
[53:50] my wife does you know in the mornings
[53:51] which is all happy things you know most
[53:54] of time but you know my alarm goes off
[53:57] at 5:00 and 5:30 or 6:00 whenever I
[54:00] sleep in you huh uh and I'm just all by
[54:03] myself but I've still got to make the
[54:05] decision in my mind to set it on truth I
[54:12] got to get it ready for truth to decide
[54:14] what's true to do the true thing do
[54:16] what's right and then I've got messages
[54:18] from my body saying I'm thirsty and
[54:20] thirsty thirsty or I'm hungry
[54:22] or whatever I've got messages there and
[54:26] I've got messages from the soul that's
[54:28] saying I'm longing for fellowship amen
[54:31] hallelujah the soul is craving
[54:34] fellowship with God is because their
[54:36] soul is your nature but in your mind
[54:39] right we got the decision do we got it
[54:41] take care of the flesh go take care of
[54:42] the kids I got to do all that - I give
[54:45] sunny toast to Victoria in the morning
[54:46] you know got to do that if I can and
[54:50] that but my soul is crying out and so is
[54:53] yours
[54:54] your soul is crying out for God now you
[54:58] seek he said seek first the kingdom of
[55:01] God now that means the
[55:05] amen and let me just say like this you
[55:11] know for me that's very simple for me
[55:13] the aim is I used to get the drinks you
[55:15] don't get they go right to read and
[55:16] write or write to prayer prayers the
[55:17] first thing I do now for moms it'll be
[55:20] different for moms right especially if
[55:21] you got children and you guys if
[55:23] everybody gets up at the same time right
[55:24] they the children get up at the same
[55:26] time the aim then is if they're all
[55:29] around us right the aims of mom is to
[55:31] meet their needs with the aim that
[55:34] you're gonna manifest God's love to them
[55:36] and eventually get the family Bible time
[55:37] right aim to get to the scripture or
[55:40] your family prayer life for my mom
[55:41] that's what it was she would come around
[55:43] and spray us you know to wake us up with
[55:45] water or vinegar you know she'd spray us
[55:47] up as teenagers and the whole thing was
[55:49] to get us to the door so we could gather
[55:51] on the door and pray before we all ran
[55:53] off to high school you know that was the
[55:55] thing that was our morning seeking God
[55:58] first day it helped in just one prayer
[56:01] we didn't read the Bible we just prayed
[56:03] and it was such a blessing upon my life
[56:06] it laid such a foundation in my life
[56:09] well that's the best my mom could do as
[56:11] a single mom you know and so a little it
[56:14] looks different you know for moms and
[56:16] dads and but this the aim is the same
[56:19] the aim is that the rule of the Holy
[56:22] Spirit will will have preeminence in our
[56:25] home it's the same for everybody so
[56:29] however it looks you know it may it may
[56:32] vary in how it looks but the aim and the
[56:36] striving for has to be the same well
[56:39] pointing to that let's say you have a
[56:41] late morning there's there's I've had
[56:42] mornings where I got up too late and I
[56:44] couldn't read the Bible pray
[56:45] well my aim then for rest today was once
[56:47] I get a free moment at lunch I'm just
[56:49] gonna skip lunch I'm gonna read my Bible
[56:51] and pray
[56:51] uh after work I'll get home out and have
[56:53] some study time and pray my aim will see
[56:56] so we're clearly aiming for we're aiming
[56:58] for fellowship with God but Jesus tells
[57:02] us if we can if we can use wisdom first
[57:06] seek the kingdom of God the rule of God
[57:10] seek that aim for that and that's that's
[57:14] how we interact with our children that's
[57:16] how I treat my children when they come
[57:17] in usually Victoria's the first
[57:19] in the morning right coming to my office
[57:21] she's rubbing her eyes now I know I got
[57:23] to take her right to the restroom and
[57:24] then take her up and get some food and I
[57:27] kind of know the routine now but my
[57:30] desire my ain't asked me to love her and
[57:32] be patient with her because there's some
[57:34] been some mornings I don't feel like I'm
[57:36] tired I don't feel like helping her out
[57:37] too much that's not a good aim Lord
[57:41] forgive me for that I don't want that
[57:42] kind of aim but the aim should be to
[57:45] manifest Christ's love right to let that
[57:48] rule my life so seeking aiming for first
[57:52] the rule of the Holy Spirit so mothers
[57:55] that's how to look for the moms I look
[57:57] for the dads to look that way in the
[57:59] morning because it's got to be first not
[58:01] last right
[58:02] you didn't say seek last he said seek
[58:05] first so our minds as we wake up should
[58:08] be first set we should be sure to aim
[58:11] them at manifesting obedience to the
[58:15] Word of God just to put it simple live
[58:17] by every word that proceeds out of the
[58:19] mouth of God that sounds sensible
[58:21] tonight that sounds everybody agree with
[58:23] that does that sound sensible that's our
[58:25] first he said seek first rather than
[58:28] just being worried about the food and
[58:30] and the water and the cereal and
[58:32] whatever and then clothes and which we
[58:36] all need that Jesus said first seek the
[58:38] kingdom the rule of the Holy Spirit and
[58:42] everything else will be added unto you
[58:44] now with sisters many times to it it's
[58:47] for dads too but we're sisters with
[58:49] children especially you know in our
[58:50] church we have you know mothers with
[58:52] young children there there there's walk
[58:57] with God will be constant prayer in
[58:59] their hearts now it should be dads too
[59:02] so like you know for like you know my
[59:04] wife she don't have time to go in the
[59:06] prayer closet like I do so she reads on
[59:08] her Bible on her bed and has her time
[59:10] with the Lord there on the bed and I'm
[59:12] sure maybe other places too sometimes at
[59:14] the breakfast table so the thing is the
[59:17] Bible says pray without ceasing so we
[59:21] take that aim where we're striving for
[59:24] that we're striving for that fellowship
[59:25] with God and as we go through about our
[59:28] day we're constantly praying asking God
[59:29] for help asking God for wisdom asking
[59:33] God for
[59:33] race to guide every event of the day
[59:36] that's our first aim is to let the
[59:41] kingdom of God rule our lives now I
[59:44] found it's not the kingdom of God rule
[59:46] in my life if I wake up and spend 30
[59:48] minutes on Facebook that's not the rule
[59:50] of God and I've been guilty of that a
[59:53] couple times I've God to forgive me so I
[59:55] show off my phone at night now and I
[59:56] just use my watch to wake up I've been
[59:58] guilty because I'm tired I don't feel
[1:00:00] like reading the Bible I don't feel like
[1:00:01] praying and I'm just tired I'm lazy and
[1:00:04] it's a and it's a thing I repent for I'm
[1:00:07] say I'm sorry that's not aiming for the
[1:00:09] kingdom of God and we're all guilty at
[1:00:13] times I imagine but the idea is to say
[1:00:16] Lord change my heart let me be stronger
[1:00:19] next time search me know my heart know
[1:00:21] my ways right and empower me to be
[1:00:24] stronger next time and I've had that
[1:00:26] experience too thank God God gives us
[1:00:28] grace to overcome so see where does this
[1:00:34] seeking come from it comes from well it
[1:00:37] starts in the mind and then it's got a
[1:00:39] yield over it say all the truth is I've
[1:00:41] got a surrender I've got to seek God
[1:00:43] first and I've got to feed the soul man
[1:00:45] and so by doing that then we where we
[1:00:51] let the desires of the soul rule the
[1:00:54] rest of the morning or the day right the
[1:00:56] rest of the morning that's what the
[1:01:00] Bible says I read this to you at one
[1:01:02] time I don't think I've read it much
[1:01:04] since a case you can you put up Isaiah
[1:01:06] 26 say I've only read it one time I
[1:01:08] think I was on new years not gonna read
[1:01:09] it again just to kind of look at the
[1:01:11] scripture again see because you have
[1:01:15] desires in your flesh we all understand
[1:01:17] those we have this but we also have
[1:01:19] desires in our soul but it's the mind
[1:01:21] that has to cast down any imagination
[1:01:24] that exalts itself against the Word of
[1:01:25] God and we've got to meet the desires of
[1:01:28] the soul so Isaiah 26 verse 8 says yay
[1:01:33] in the way of thy judgments O Lord have
[1:01:35] we waited for thee the desire of our
[1:01:37] soul is to thy name and to the
[1:01:40] remembrance of thee so where's the
[1:01:42] desire come from the soul you've got to
[1:01:44] meet the flesh desires and the soul
[1:01:46] desires
[1:01:47] but what does it the mind the mind verse
[1:01:52] 9 with my soul have I desired the in the
[1:01:56] night what brought you to church the
[1:01:57] desire of your soul hey I think I didn't
[1:02:00] my physical body didn't feel like coming
[1:02:02] I got a headache I'm tired I just feel
[1:02:04] like I maybe I didn't get enough sleep
[1:02:06] this week my flesh didn't feel like
[1:02:08] coming but my sole desire fellowship
[1:02:11] with God my soul desires to worship and
[1:02:15] sing and praise God and lift my hands
[1:02:17] and exalt his name and to intercede for
[1:02:20] sinners praise God and to pray for the
[1:02:23] sick my soul desires that but I've got
[1:02:25] to choose to let the desires of my soul
[1:02:28] be met and so do you you've got to seek
[1:02:32] that first gotta seek to meet the
[1:02:35] desires of the soul first alright
[1:02:40] now the reason many don't seek God first
[1:02:43] is because their souls not right with
[1:02:46] God
[1:02:47] so either they're not born again or
[1:02:50] they're not even saved right the only
[1:02:54] way someone would not seek God with
[1:02:56] their soul is if they're not born again
[1:02:59] or they're not even saved in most cases
[1:03:03] jesus said a few there be that find the
[1:03:05] kingdom in most cases most church
[1:03:07] members aren't born again I'm talking
[1:03:09] about over worldwide right and so
[1:03:13] they're not born again so their soul
[1:03:15] doesn't desire God on Wednesday night or
[1:03:18] Sunday night you see what I'm saying or
[1:03:20] Friday night we have Friday night
[1:03:21] service their souls don't desire that
[1:03:24] they'd rather do something else
[1:03:25] they just rather do that because their
[1:03:28] soul is not being fed they starve this
[1:03:31] soul and their mind they're choosing are
[1:03:33] the needs of the flesh they're aiming at
[1:03:35] the flesh rather than aiming at the soul
[1:03:39] praise God but church all's we got to do
[1:03:43] we make a mistake all the others say
[1:03:44] Lord I'm sorry forgive me
[1:03:47] create in me a clean heart amen and
[1:03:52] renew a right spirit in my mind because
[1:03:55] I chose I may have chosen the wrong a
[1:03:57] desire may have chosen as of hours of
[1:04:00] the flesh
[1:04:00] the food the money so that you have
[1:04:03] money though the water and the clothes
[1:04:06] but Lord I'm asking you to change my
[1:04:09] mind that I'll choose the desire of the
[1:04:11] soul to have fellowship with God I hope
[1:04:19] it's making sense tonight by God's grace
[1:04:21] Jesus says aim first for my Dominion and
[1:04:27] we meet we know that means the soul
[1:04:28] right because I want to make a point
[1:04:32] here Church you and I can all look at we
[1:04:35] say like this foolish virgins now I say
[1:04:38] that a nice way I'm not saying that mean
[1:04:39] way but some of them have more devoted
[1:04:42] seeking than maybe we do right like
[1:04:46] let's look at a cat let's look at a real
[1:04:47] sincere Catholic priest okay the
[1:04:49] Catholic priest is not married doesn't
[1:04:50] have children running around but yeah
[1:04:52] they get up in the morning and they
[1:04:53] memorize the Greek and the Hebrew the
[1:04:56] Latin they were they memorize the Latin
[1:04:58] prayers right of saints dead Saints that
[1:05:01] they're gonna pray to later that day
[1:05:02] they got up early and they're seeking
[1:05:05] something right but it's not the Word of
[1:05:08] the hour right it's not if it's seeking
[1:05:11] maybe prayers to Mary they're saying
[1:05:13] Hail Marys so they have their devotion
[1:05:18] down but they're not seeking the real
[1:05:21] kingdom of God there it is Amen that's
[1:05:23] right how do they view looks like this
[1:05:26] they're seeking the Catholic Kingdom or
[1:05:28] the Baptist kingdom rather than the holy
[1:05:30] ghost kingdom amen never understand and
[1:05:32] they might put us to shame even in
[1:05:36] seeking God and I hope not too much I
[1:05:37] hope we're dedicated to God but the
[1:05:43] point is what I want to make is that
[1:05:45] that separates the wise version from the
[1:05:48] the foolish virgin the foolish version
[1:05:50] is not seeking the true baptism of the
[1:05:52] Holy Ghost they're seeking an
[1:05:54] organization or they're seeking to win
[1:05:55] their argument or they're seeking
[1:05:57] another the church to get more money
[1:05:59] their motivation is on this the word and
[1:06:02] living a righteous life and living all
[1:06:05] the Word of God but that should be our
[1:06:08] desire is to manifest all the Word of
[1:06:10] God that separates us
[1:06:15] because you know what you know why some
[1:06:17] of those Catholic priests do that and
[1:06:18] those Baptist ministers know why they do
[1:06:20] that because if they don't they're not
[1:06:21] going to get their food right they're
[1:06:24] gonna lose their paychecks they're not
[1:06:27] getting their food their water their
[1:06:28] clothes because their denomination is
[1:06:29] gonna keep them out they're gonna boot
[1:06:31] about the door oh you're not gonna
[1:06:33] preach our Creed see yeah so see a lot
[1:06:37] of their sinking is really seeking based
[1:06:40] upon creed and organization and
[1:06:44] financial pressure rather than seeking
[1:06:47] the true kingdom of God Church let me
[1:06:49] ask you is there going to be one
[1:06:51] abomination in God's kingdom
[1:06:53] no well then then why do Catholics allow
[1:06:56] homosexuals to come to their churches
[1:06:58] why did why are Baptists and Lutheran's
[1:07:00] the presbytery why are they allowing it
[1:07:02] it's a proof that they're not seeking
[1:07:04] the real kingdom of God amen hallelujah
[1:07:07] see when we are seeking the kingdom of
[1:07:11] God
[1:07:11] we're seeking the real rule and Dominion
[1:07:15] of the kingdom of God God's rule of his
[1:07:18] will of his word of the true Bible
[1:07:22] apostolic truth amen that's the kingdom
[1:07:25] we're believing in that's the kingdom
[1:07:27] we're seeking hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:07:31] so see ultimately those type of false or
[1:07:34] we'd say not false but I'll see like
[1:07:41] churches without the real baptism holy
[1:07:43] ghost they're not really dominated by
[1:07:46] the kingdom of God but it's dominated by
[1:07:50] actually their natural food drink and
[1:07:52] clothes because they're doing it for a
[1:07:54] paycheck many of them not all many of
[1:07:57] them so jesus said
[1:08:00] aim to be dominated by the spiritual
[1:08:03] things he said Christ righteousness in
[1:08:08] your soul aim to be dominated by that
[1:08:15] praise God
[1:08:19] now he
[1:08:20] seek ye first the kingdom and his
[1:08:24] righteousness don't forget that and
[1:08:27] right what is righteousness church it
[1:08:31] means this integrity virtue purity of
[1:08:37] life rightness correctness of thinking
[1:08:41] feeling and acting praise God
[1:08:45] so seek first my kingdom my Dominion my
[1:08:48] rule and his righteousness his integrity
[1:08:52] his virtue his purity amen how many more
[1:08:57] virtue in their life how he needs more
[1:09:00] power to you that's right
[1:09:01] how many more purity in their lives amen
[1:09:04] this is what Jesus say seek my rule my
[1:09:08] kingdom and my righteousness see so
[1:09:13] everyday Church we have to wake up no
[1:09:16] matter where we're at in life and say
[1:09:18] Lord I need more purity I need more
[1:09:22] virtue he said I did he said I need more
[1:09:25] correct thinking amen I need more
[1:09:29] correct actions and I'm seeking it
[1:09:31] praise God I'm aiming for that that's my
[1:09:36] goal for the day not to watch reruns on
[1:09:39] Disney Plus or Netflix you know that's
[1:09:41] not my aim for the day my aim for the
[1:09:44] day is to be more pure to seek the rule
[1:09:47] of the kingdom of God and the integrity
[1:09:50] of Christ's righteousness now for me
[1:09:54] that looks like I go my prayer cause I
[1:09:56] ask God to forgive my sins and I worship
[1:09:58] Him I love him
[1:09:59] I praise Him ask him to make me a pure
[1:10:01] heart give me the word for your people
[1:10:02] for tonight was when I was praying this
[1:10:04] morning Lord you know I needed help me
[1:10:06] I'm nothing you know I try to I try to
[1:10:08] seek His righteousness and as I studied
[1:10:10] that the word try to let it open itself
[1:10:13] up that I can see it and then I can try
[1:10:15] to present it to you praise God that's
[1:10:17] how it looks like to me so see we first
[1:10:21] our first aim is to strive to be in
[1:10:24] early ruled by the integrity and purity
[1:10:28] and virtue of Jesus Christ he says
[1:10:34] get that first if you can first get that
[1:10:37] the Dominion or rule of my spirit and my
[1:10:40] integrity and my purity I'll add all
[1:10:43] your other physical needs just aim for
[1:10:45] that
[1:10:46] that's your first aim now it's not your
[1:10:48] second it's our first aim praise God
[1:10:55] praise the Lord thank you Jesus
[1:10:59] and this is called as you know giving
[1:11:02] God preeminence cautions 1:18 that in
[1:11:06] all things he might have the preeminence
[1:11:11] praise God
[1:11:12] let me cross off what I got here so we
[1:11:15] pray for the kingdom could pray without
[1:11:21] ceasing for the kingdom
[1:11:23] we saw how wise versus foolish I want to
[1:11:36] go
[1:11:36] bit deeper here now remember there's
[1:11:39] only two kinds of Christian let's go a
[1:11:41] little bit deeper on the wise and
[1:11:42] foolish virgins the Bible says in
[1:11:45] proverbs 4 7 but you Paul an application
[1:11:47] proverbs 4 7 wisdom is the principal
[1:11:50] thing therefore get wisdom with all thy
[1:11:53] getting get wit get understanding
[1:11:57] that's proverbs 4 7 so Solomon says the
[1:12:04] main thing to do is get the wisdom of
[1:12:05] God
[1:12:06] right which wisdom is defined as let me
[1:12:11] pull it up here where did I put it oh
[1:12:15] yeah there is skillful or shrewdness so
[1:12:19] the main thing to get is the ability to
[1:12:21] make the right decision at the right
[1:12:23] time Amen hallelujah Southern said get
[1:12:28] that get the ability or cuz I say like
[1:12:31] this get the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:33] to make the right choice amen and
[1:12:36] housing his secret every day seek him
[1:12:38] first I love that coal program did he
[1:12:42] said seek God first pray every day
[1:12:44] before you make a decision say father
[1:12:45] shall I do this I got I got the paper
[1:12:48] hanging there in my office I'm sure the
[1:12:49] children have seen it voice of God sent
[1:12:51] it out years ago I love that quote he
[1:12:53] said God may not speak of audible voice
[1:12:55] but he'll answer you somehow praise God
[1:12:58] like even the last time I bought that
[1:13:02] car a couple weeks ago intro is here I
[1:13:04] just prayed Lord just work it out you
[1:13:06] know I don't know
[1:13:07] so his flight was delayed three hours
[1:13:09] and that allowed me to go get the car
[1:13:11] and during that three hours he got time
[1:13:13] to study and preach the message on
[1:13:15] Saturday night I just worked I was
[1:13:18] worried I was trying to but you know I'm
[1:13:20] trying to worry figure out how this is
[1:13:21] gonna work out I didn't even worry about
[1:13:22] it anymore
[1:13:23] I just went prayed about in the morning
[1:13:24] I said Lord you allow it work work it
[1:13:26] out by God's grace I want to be in
[1:13:28] service night I want to worship you but
[1:13:30] I got this business I got to take care
[1:13:31] of and it proved to me again that if I
[1:13:34] see God first everything else should be
[1:13:36] added unto me just in a simple way like
[1:13:39] that a simple way of before the day I've
[1:13:42] got all this house is gonna work out
[1:13:44] my main thing is to seek God first God
[1:13:47] give me the purity now out of it okay
[1:13:49] not
[1:13:50] in the car I would have been ok I would
[1:13:51] have been but you know the Lord no I
[1:13:53] wanted to I want to get these things
[1:13:54] done these business deals and everything
[1:13:56] I want to pick him up on time I don't
[1:13:57] wanna be late everything just worked out
[1:13:59] and I found that in my life I got to put
[1:14:02] the first things first put God first
[1:14:04] seek his kingdom his purity first and
[1:14:07] then everything else falls right into
[1:14:09] place like a Tetris puzzle praise God
[1:14:11] hey amen wisdom is the principal thing
[1:14:17] making the the right decision at the
[1:14:20] right time that's the most important
[1:14:22] thing that's what Solomon says and the
[1:14:26] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:14:27] wisdom we know that now Paul's the one
[1:14:31] that said redeem the time you said it
[1:14:32] twice and this is our wise and foolish
[1:14:35] version text in Ephesians 5:14 wherefore
[1:14:39] he saith awake thou that sleepest and
[1:14:40] arise from the dead in Christ shall give
[1:14:42] thee light verse 15 see them that you
[1:14:44] walk circumspectly remember that means
[1:14:46] exactly not as fool's but as wise redeem
[1:14:51] at the time because the days are evil
[1:14:53] wherefore be not unwise but
[1:14:55] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:14:57] is Paul says it again well Colossians
[1:15:03] 4:5 please occasionally now here Paul
[1:15:09] says you need to be wise among sinners
[1:15:12] look what he says here in Colossians 4:5
[1:15:16] so you need to be able to make wise
[1:15:18] choices among sinners whether it's
[1:15:21] family members friends co-workers fellow
[1:15:24] students walk in wisdom skillfulness
[1:15:27] toward them that are without redeeming
[1:15:30] the time so make use of the time when
[1:15:34] you're around sinners right yeah let you
[1:15:41] look at verse 6 let your speech be
[1:15:42] always with grace seasoned with salt
[1:15:47] that you may know how you ought to
[1:15:49] answer every man so obviously it's very
[1:15:53] important thing about our time is how we
[1:15:55] handle our conversations because he says
[1:15:59] let your speech have grace in it we
[1:16:02] shouldn't be
[1:16:03] condemning everybody although in our
[1:16:04] hearts we know what's going to happen to
[1:16:06] people that break the word we know
[1:16:08] what's going to happen but we shouldn't
[1:16:09] be condemning them right away we should
[1:16:11] be showing grace to people to all of
[1:16:19] your time and my time is precious Paul
[1:16:22] says the wise walk exactly they know
[1:16:26] exactly what they're gonna do throughout
[1:16:28] the day by the leadership of the Holy
[1:16:30] Spirit I'm not saying every little thing
[1:16:32] but I'm saying seeking God my first aim
[1:16:34] is to seek God that's that's how I'm
[1:16:37] gonna walk each day so wise Christians
[1:16:41] daily seek God's kingdom first that
[1:16:45] inward ruling power of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:48] and wise Christians start their days
[1:16:51] seeking furnishings won't make the best
[1:16:54] use of their time they'll seek natural
[1:16:56] needs first before seeking spiritual
[1:17:00] needs of Jesus's kingdom they're gonna
[1:17:03] seek you know the kingdom of their their
[1:17:05] company rather than kingdom of God first
[1:17:07] right they're gonna seek the kingdom of
[1:17:10] best buy or whatever company they worked
[1:17:14] for or the kingdom of the government
[1:17:16] they're gonna seek those kingdoms first
[1:17:18] before seeking the kingdom of Christ
[1:17:22] that's right I believe that so see when
[1:17:34] we and I want to get to this seeking God
[1:17:36] in the morning now when you seek God in
[1:17:38] the morning it keeps your soul aimed at
[1:17:41] Christ and his kingdom because it just
[1:17:44] starts start your day the right way like
[1:17:46] remembered God told Cain if you don't do
[1:17:48] the right way sin lies at the door if
[1:17:50] you don't get your highlight if you
[1:17:52] don't get sins confess before you walk
[1:17:55] out that door you're gonna you're gonna
[1:17:57] suffer the consequences of not getting
[1:17:59] it right that's what God told Cain is
[1:18:02] gonna be right there at the door as you
[1:18:04] know if you don't make this right and
[1:18:05] worship the right way if you don't get
[1:18:07] your your if you don't see God's first
[1:18:09] amen if you don't put the right
[1:18:10] sacrifice there if you don't obey God's
[1:18:12] Word sins gonna be right there that's
[1:18:15] gonna torment you
[1:18:17] praise God it's gonna be right there at
[1:18:20] the door I'm gonna run in trouble right
[1:18:22] away we've got to put God's kingdom
[1:18:25] first so see getting up having a morning
[1:18:29] a morning time with the Lord morning
[1:18:32] fellowship keeps your soul right where
[1:18:35] it needs to be where your mind makes a
[1:18:37] choice I'm gonna seek God I'm gonna give
[1:18:39] this soul its desire I'm gonna feed that
[1:18:41] desire I'm gonna give that fellowship
[1:18:44] with God and that will have all my other
[1:18:46] desires met because I've been on both
[1:18:51] sides yeah I'm a morning person I like
[1:18:54] the morning but I there's been times
[1:18:56] where I here's what I found I'm either
[1:18:59] in a hurry I'm either in a hurry to do
[1:19:03] my Bible time and then go to work or I'm
[1:19:05] in a hurry to eat and then go to work so
[1:19:07] I always want to be in a hurry to eat so
[1:19:11] now in other words I'm gonna take care
[1:19:12] of my spiritual needs first and I want
[1:19:14] to give God more time so I'm kind of
[1:19:16] crunched for time getting dressed and
[1:19:18] combing my hair and shuffling down the
[1:19:21] orange and apple and yogurt or whatever
[1:19:23] I eat in the morning know what i mean i
[1:19:25] i'd rather give God my best time and
[1:19:29] then me rushing oh I better hurry but I
[1:19:31] got no I gotta go to work I rather be
[1:19:33] rushed for work than be rushed on God
[1:19:37] because I've had to deal with that over
[1:19:39] the years I've got to keep my soul aimed
[1:19:44] at Christ and his kingdom the purity of
[1:19:49] my heart strive to have integrity of
[1:19:52] Jesus Christ like there was a
[1:20:00] you know this week and I felt LED years
[1:20:03] ago I felt led to stand up at my door my
[1:20:05] classroom and before the kids come in I
[1:20:07] shake every one of their hands I get
[1:20:08] down say I say salutations how are you
[1:20:11] today
[1:20:11] I say packing her by and you know and we
[1:20:16] had a woman older woman visit our school
[1:20:20] and she saw me doing that I said come on
[1:20:22] and she says oh no I this this is she
[1:20:24] said this is outstanding and then the
[1:20:26] principal told me later she walked out
[1:20:27] of the school crying talking about me
[1:20:29] how I sit there and shake their hand
[1:20:31] because I learned years ago if you want
[1:20:33] to teach their mind you got to first
[1:20:35] contact their heart so the first thing
[1:20:38] all my fingers greet the teacher that's
[1:20:40] the first thing they do is they go I
[1:20:42] just I didn't even realize it so now I
[1:20:44] have an order of morning routine the
[1:20:46] first thing is greet the teacher that's
[1:20:48] like us we got to greet Jesus amen the
[1:20:50] first thing in the morning is great the
[1:20:52] Lord and tell you I love you Jesus amen
[1:20:54] but that really blessed me this week
[1:20:57] that woman she's an older woman but she
[1:20:59] walked out and she lot walked out crying
[1:21:00] because she never saw a teacher care so
[1:21:03] much about the kids to greet them at the
[1:21:05] door and just welcomed them to school
[1:21:07] and that's how we should be with the
[1:21:10] Lord every morning praise God we should
[1:21:13] seek God and say Lord good morning thank
[1:21:15] you for another night thanks for another
[1:21:17] arrest I'm here to seek you Lord and I
[1:21:20] thank you I want to be in your presence
[1:21:21] I don't love you teach me to walk in
[1:21:23] your Commandments that's a little
[1:21:27] testimony I had this week and I didn't
[1:21:31] you know I don't I do that every morning
[1:21:32] I don't put on you know I don't try to
[1:21:33] impress people I just do that every
[1:21:35] morning so wisdom and your morning
[1:21:42] routine your morning time with the Lord
[1:21:43] is your opportunity to seek the most
[1:21:46] important thing which is wisdom skillful
[1:21:50] decisions the right decision at the
[1:21:51] right time another word another way to
[1:21:54] say is the perfect will of God it gives
[1:21:57] you the chance to decide on the perfect
[1:21:59] will of God and church
[1:22:04] is redeeming the time for sure now go if
[1:22:10] you would now to Revelation 3:16 I'm
[1:22:14] gonna try to close here in about ten
[1:22:15] minutes er now here's what I want to say
[1:22:23] for our church and you know just
[1:22:26] Christians in general if we don't have
[1:22:31] that morning time which I know a lot of
[1:22:34] our friends say oh I mean friends like
[1:22:37] in the world oh I'm not a morning person
[1:22:39] or something like that yeah that's fine
[1:22:40] we might not have to be the morning
[1:22:41] person but once once we get up we have
[1:22:44] to aim at the kingdom of God I don't
[1:22:48] care if you're not a morning person or
[1:22:49] not where no matter what time we get up
[1:22:51] we got to start aiming at the kingdom of
[1:22:52] God we got to set our I got to set our
[1:22:55] arrow right on the the target of God's
[1:22:58] kingdom that's got to be our aim for the
[1:23:00] day no matter what time we get up see so
[1:23:03] in Revelation 3 the great road man said
[1:23:08] this is the greatest rebuke in the Bible
[1:23:10] you know he said that in the church age
[1:23:12] book he said this is the greatest rebuke
[1:23:14] in the Bible so then because thou art
[1:23:17] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:23:19] spew thee out of my mouth NEX scripture
[1:23:21] here's why
[1:23:23] for 6:17 verse 17 because they'll say as
[1:23:26] I'm rich increased with Goods and right
[1:23:27] here don't need nothing they don't need
[1:23:32] anything they don't need to aim they
[1:23:35] don't have a need for the spiritual
[1:23:36] things of God they've got their natural
[1:23:38] if they've got their food water clothes
[1:23:42] they're rich increases they don't have
[1:23:44] need of nothing and they don't even know
[1:23:45] spiritually they're wretched miserable
[1:23:47] poor blind and naked leave that up there
[1:23:49] for a little bit Lydia leave it up there
[1:23:51] so the reason the reason I think many
[1:23:55] people that say they're Christians or
[1:23:57] maybe in the message or whatever the
[1:23:59] reason they don't seek God in the
[1:24:00] morning is because they're lukewarm
[1:24:03] because the lukewarm person says I don't
[1:24:06] really have a need to seek God I don't
[1:24:08] really need to aim at God I've got
[1:24:10] enough religion I get enough preaching
[1:24:12] do you if you did you'd want more
[1:24:16] there's God amen because it's seeking
[1:24:23] first the kingdom of God and His
[1:24:25] righteousness his purity his integrity
[1:24:28] and then everything else will be added
[1:24:30] unto you
[1:24:31] this is the reason many people don't
[1:24:34] seek God in the morning because they're
[1:24:35] lukewarm then their minds maybe they've
[1:24:39] just gotten such a bad habit that they
[1:24:41] can't even they can't even hear the soul
[1:24:43] is not they're not even listening to
[1:24:44] desires the soul saying give me
[1:24:46] fellowship with God give me pleasure but
[1:24:47] they they they quench that so many times
[1:24:50] that certainly they don't even hear
[1:24:52] anymore let's get up get their coffee or
[1:24:53] get their McDonald's and run to work
[1:24:55] I'll run to school right or run to
[1:24:59] Netflix or whatever they do right they
[1:25:03] can't even hear the soul and Jesus says
[1:25:06] if you don't have an EVE you're not
[1:25:07] meeting the needs of the kingdom then
[1:25:10] you're rich and in your wretched
[1:25:12] miserable I'm poor and don't even know
[1:25:15] it and then they can
[1:25:20] the mouthpiece of God no wonder they
[1:25:21] can't witness no wonder they can't lift
[1:25:23] anybody's spirits because their views
[1:25:26] them out they're no longer the
[1:25:28] mouthpiece of God they don't speak God's
[1:25:30] Word see they don't need it in other
[1:25:37] words they've quenched the voice of the
[1:25:40] desire of the soul they only hear the
[1:25:42] desires of the flesh you need this you
[1:25:44] need that get that get the coffee stop
[1:25:46] and get the Dunkin donut stopping at the
[1:25:48] bagel that's all they hear they don't
[1:25:51] hit that they stop listening to you they
[1:25:54] can't even hear the soul crying out for
[1:25:56] fellowship with God anymore and it's the
[1:25:58] greatest rebuke in the Bible my now
[1:26:05] church do you remember next verse I
[1:26:07] think you remember don't you it says but
[1:26:11] call me said and buy me gold what is
[1:26:13] gold time-tested faith Peter said your
[1:26:16] faith tested is more precious and gold
[1:26:17] so when we come to Christ we're asking
[1:26:20] for time-tested faith he said come get
[1:26:25] my white raiment which is Christ
[1:26:27] righteous character and the I saw that
[1:26:30] anoints the eyes that you can see the
[1:26:32] kingdom of God there it is Amen you can
[1:26:35] see it you're not blind but you see the
[1:26:38] kingdom of God but they need ice out
[1:26:41] because they can't see the kingdom of
[1:26:43] God they don't even know what it looks
[1:26:44] like for the Holy Ghost to rule your
[1:26:46] morning life or your whole day they
[1:26:49] don't even know what it looks like so
[1:26:51] which one are you and I associated with
[1:26:53] what is our church you know what we have
[1:26:55] to ask ourselves that question are we
[1:26:57] are we have the group that our first
[1:27:00] thing in the morning after you know
[1:27:01] regular things is seeking God aiming for
[1:27:04] the kingdom of God do we cut more real
[1:27:06] in our lives or are we seeking after
[1:27:07] natural things because it's only what
[1:27:11] Jesus said it's only one of the other he
[1:27:14] said the Gentiles are seeking the
[1:27:15] natural things but my servants in my
[1:27:17] kingdom they have to seek my kingdom
[1:27:20] first and I'm gonna
[1:27:26] here just a moment now Jesus promise if
[1:27:28] you seek him you'll find him Luke 11:10
[1:27:31] says for every one that asked receives
[1:27:34] and he that seeks finds and to him that
[1:27:37] knocketh it shall be opened hallelujah
[1:27:43] jesus said many will seek but it'll be
[1:27:45] too late that's after the rapture
[1:27:46] they're gonna they're gonna seek and say
[1:27:48] open unto us may be seeking at the wrong
[1:27:51] time and Jesus said it's too late you
[1:27:54] did not redeem the time when you had the
[1:27:56] chance
[1:28:03] got some scratch in here as I mentioned
[1:28:10] on Sunday the whole Old Testament shows
[1:28:13] the type in shadow
[1:28:14] Aaron God told Aaron a morning sacrifice
[1:28:17] and an evening sacrifice Exodus 30 verse
[1:28:22] 7 says and Aaron shall burn thereon
[1:28:25] sweet incense every morning and when he
[1:28:28] dresses the lamps he shall burn incense
[1:28:30] upon it amen
[1:28:31] sweet fiery incense glory to God help us
[1:28:37] all amen
[1:28:37] sweet fiery prayers prayers from the
[1:28:40] heart Amen that are burning with desire
[1:28:42] god save my dad saved my mom I think
[1:28:45] that was my prayer Easter day God Lord
[1:28:49] do a miracle for Mark de Lucia
[1:28:51] we should have burning prayers coming up
[1:28:54] before God and it's it's foreshadowed in
[1:28:58] the Old Testament morning and evening
[1:29:02] David I'm sorry Daniel morning prayers
[1:29:04] noon prayers evening prayers and that
[1:29:07] that kind of devotion that kind of
[1:29:09] fellowship with God allowed him to see
[1:29:10] angels when he was older he actually
[1:29:13] fellowship with angels because he had
[1:29:15] the morning evening was a morning noon
[1:29:18] and evening prayer life I don't know
[1:29:20] we're not gay I know prophets are most
[1:29:21] likely to see angels I'm saying our
[1:29:23] communion with God would be so much
[1:29:24] better if we seek God seek his kingdom
[1:29:27] first and everything else will take care
[1:29:28] of itself David a man after God's own
[1:29:33] heart in Psalms 5 verse 3 said my voice
[1:29:36] shout out here in the morning O Lord in
[1:29:39] morning where I direct my prayer unto
[1:29:41] thee and will look up Psalm 63 1 a psalm
[1:29:47] of David when he was in the wilderness
[1:29:48] of Judah Oh God my god early will I seek
[1:29:51] thee my soul thirsts for thee my flesh
[1:29:54] longing for the dry and thirsty land
[1:29:57] where no water is Psalm 63 - to see thy
[1:30:05] power thy glory so as I have seen thee
[1:30:08] in the sanctuary my heart is fixed O God
[1:30:10] my heart is fixed I will sing and give
[1:30:12] praise or wake up my glory awake
[1:30:14] psaltery and harp I myself will awake
[1:30:17] early I will praise thee O Lord among
[1:30:21] the people
[1:30:22] I will sing unto thee among the nations
[1:30:24] your David a man after God's own heart
[1:30:28] he said Lord I'll make sure I'm gonna
[1:30:29] get up early you're gonna hear my voice
[1:30:30] in the morning I'm gonna praise in the
[1:30:32] morning I'm gonna get up early so I can
[1:30:34] spend that time with you my soul longs
[1:30:36] for it praise God
[1:30:39] you know Jesus got up real early we know
[1:30:41] that right after the revival services of
[1:30:44] the healing services and mark 1:35 the
[1:30:46] very next scripture after he heals the
[1:30:47] multitudes mark 1:35 says in the morning
[1:30:51] rising up a great while before day he
[1:30:54] went out and departed into a solitary
[1:30:56] place and there prayed if Jesus Christ
[1:31:00] the Son of God without a sinful nature
[1:31:03] had to go pray to get his mind right
[1:31:07] before the day I think we need to do
[1:31:09] that too don't you and we do it as we
[1:31:13] said we do it through our role in life
[1:31:15] whether father mother child teenager
[1:31:21] teenagers you guys you have to learn
[1:31:25] that in your life the early alert the
[1:31:28] more blessings you'll see because of it
[1:31:32] that's the secret
[1:31:34] secret is that fellowship with the Lord
[1:31:36] seek God first that's the secret see God
[1:31:39] first everything else to take care of it
[1:31:42] Jesus got up early and he went to a loan
[1:31:45] place a solitary place and there he
[1:31:48] prayed look at proverbs 8:17 I love that
[1:31:54] this is wisdom lady wisdom I love them
[1:31:57] that love me and those that seek me
[1:31:59] early shall find me so Jesus Jesus says
[1:32:04] the same thing wisdom says a thousand
[1:32:06] years before wisdom said if you seek me
[1:32:09] early you'll find me
[1:32:10] jesus said everyone that seeks shall
[1:32:13] find every one that knocks shall open
[1:32:15] wax is the same spirit praise God hey
[1:32:17] man how they live yeah same spirit all
[1:32:24] right let's say into our feet here I
[1:32:25] think I want to stop right there now
[1:32:30] there's a few more directions that may
[1:32:31] go next time like I said I wonder study
[1:32:36] more on the prove all things but it's
[1:32:38] gonna take hours and hours so some of
[1:32:40] those topics I'm new to I don't really
[1:32:42] have any background in those so I didn't
[1:32:45] have enough time to study those but I
[1:32:46] hope this was a blessing how many want
[1:32:48] to see God's kingdom first how many want
[1:32:51] to aim for the virtue and the integrity
[1:32:54] of Jesus Christ ruling their life how do
[1:32:56] you want to aim for that that's my
[1:32:58] musicians you can come up here let's
[1:33:02] sing that seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:33:04] God as we pray here tonight to me this
[1:33:11] is the difference between a wise and a
[1:33:13] foolish virgin I could be wrong but
[1:33:15] someone who's so on fire for God are
[1:33:18] some of that so thirst for God that as
[1:33:20] soon as they wake up oh yes I got a I
[1:33:22] got to feed the desire of the soul the
[1:33:24] soul is crying out for fellowship I got
[1:33:26] to give that prayer time with God even
[1:33:27] as I'm helping the children I can do
[1:33:29] that even as I'm getting the breakfast
[1:33:31] ready
[1:33:31] I can do that I can say yes Laura I can
[1:33:33] turn on a sermon I can turn on music I
[1:33:35] can get my mind my soul having
[1:33:37] fellowship with God
[1:33:39] [Music]
[1:33:41] don't you think Jesus wants to hear moms
[1:33:43] and dads sing in the kitchen in the
[1:33:44] morning they might be flipping pancakes
[1:33:47] like a Casey does it might be flipping
[1:33:53] eggs like a Casey those two and Lydia
[1:33:55] used to but they can sing while they're
[1:34:00] doing it and they'll feed their soul and
[1:34:02] talk with the Lord children even do that
[1:34:07] the Bible says pray without ceasing I
[1:34:12] was my family I was our church to
[1:34:15] develop that desire first thing get the
[1:34:18] mind right okay what's true what's true

[1:34:59] be rooted and grounded in love that him
[1:35:03] here it is heshes 318 that we may be
[1:35:06] able to comprehend with All Saints what
[1:35:08] is the breadth the length and the depth
[1:35:10] and height and to know the love of
[1:35:13] Christ which passes all knowledge that

[1:35:34] great your love is knowing how much you
[1:35:42] love us makes us for the fellowship with
[1:35:44] you is if anybody love me that much to
[1:35:46] die for me surely they want what's best

[1:35:53] than I can
[1:35:54] thank God they can help me in my life
[1:35:58] and a worthy cause
[1:36:00] not just food and water and clothes no
[1:36:03] god but something greater than that the
[1:36:07] purity of heart the integrity the
[1:36:10] honesty of a Christian the virtue the
[1:36:15] strength of a Christian the moral
[1:36:17] strength of a Holy Ghost they'd say dear
[1:36:19] God lord I pray for the church I pray

[1:36:25] learn the secret first all the days of
[1:36:27] our life to you it wasn't a suggestion

[1:36:35] God the rules are only spirit the inward
[1:36:39] rule and your righteousness your purity
[1:36:42] of heart and everything else will be
