[11:31] now and then this picture comes up when
[11:33] we baptize you brother in the name of
[11:34] the lord so i on my computer it recycles
[11:37] through all the old pictures and so i'll
[11:39] get your picture up sister who is up
[11:41] there brother amen all my children so we
[11:44] love you buddy god bless you
[11:46] it's good to see you in the house of
[11:47] lord today praise god sir yesterday so
[11:50] let's pray for her as well as we
[11:52] take a few prayer requests here today
[11:55] let's remember brother jose i got to
[11:56] visit him this morning and
[11:58] he said the last 36 hours have been
[12:00] awful he said he felt like his heart has
[12:02] been squeezed from both sides
[12:04] he could hardly breathe but he said
[12:06] before right before i got there he said
[12:07] his heart started feeling a lot better
[12:09] and then by the time i left he said he
[12:11] had no more pain
[12:12] so thank you for your prayers
[12:14] and we thank the lord jesus for his
[12:16] grace but he said i'll probably be in
[12:18] there one more day if everything goes
[12:19] smooth like it's going right now
[12:21] probably they'll keep them for one more
[12:22] day the doctor said he had a heart
[12:25] attack
[12:27] so um
[12:28] they say if if you have another likely
[12:31] it's within 24 to 48 hours so that's why
[12:34] he's got to stay there one more day
[12:37] and so then i just oh brother
[12:39] uh i probably well i'll see you tomorrow
[12:40] but you might be home tomorrow as well
[12:42] so hopefully hopefully he's home
[12:43] tomorrow
[12:45] by the grace of the lord you're always
[12:46] welcome to see them now they're only
[12:47] taking two time back there so if you go
[12:49] you can only only two people go go at a
[12:51] time you gotta wear a mask you know just
[12:53] take it off while i'm in there you know
[12:55] uh but he's doing a lot better by god's
[12:57] grace
[12:58] oh yeah do you want to tell me he loves
[13:00] everybody and he thanks you for your
[13:02] prayers he said make sure you tell the
[13:03] church
[13:05] he loves everybody and he thanks you for
[13:08] your prayers
[13:09] his sister though jolene he said has
[13:11] blood pressure so he said well you asked
[13:12] the church to pray for his sister she
[13:14] visited us one time
[13:16] and i said yes we'll pray for his
[13:18] sister
[13:20] but you remember the five miracles mike
[13:22] mccloskey benjamin who brian mcnaccola
[13:25] simon and vivian pratt
[13:27] as i said i did see zuri yesterday i
[13:29] told her she's welcome to come back to
[13:30] the church i said we pray for her often
[13:33] and i've seen her target's parking lots
[13:36] i was like sir
[13:38] he was really shocked to see that my
[13:40] ball cap oh my jesus happened
[13:43] i didn't look normal you know
[13:44] kind of strange
[13:49] we really miss you at the church and i
[13:50] said uh we'll pray for you
[13:52] so let's pray for her this morning
[13:55] and brother amen has unspoken that's so
[13:57] it's remember that in prayer
[13:59] the grace of god this announcement you
[14:00] know
[14:01] i'm probably gonna cancel service here
[14:03] on the 28th hopefully everybody can make
[14:04] it over and if not they can live stream
[14:06] but it looks like at this point most of
[14:08] the saints are going to head over to
[14:09] napoleon
[14:10] if you need a place to stay let me know
[14:12] but austin i got you and uh lena plays
[14:14] at
[14:15] said you could stay there
[14:17] we got a hotel for naomi and beatrice
[14:19] and the family
[14:20] i'm going to call a check on that
[14:22] today because i talked to a worker and
[14:24] it was really hard to understand her
[14:25] side of hopefully that hopefully went
[14:27] through you know
[14:29] i heard from my brother-in-law's that
[14:30] they recently changed uh
[14:32] ownership at that hotel so
[14:35] i'm just gonna call and make sure if you
[14:37] need a place to stay brother cam said
[14:38] reach out to him or i can reach out to
[14:40] him for you and he said the families of
[14:42] the church would love to host you you
[14:43] know
[14:45] so we'll just plan on that we'll just
[14:46] cancel service on the 29th there'll be
[14:49] no service here
[14:50] we'll just see everybody can head over
[14:52] there

[34:46] the lord
[34:52] we're thankful again for the grace of
[34:53] god
[34:54] and uh trying to get just a little
[34:57] picture here
[35:11] trying to get a picture of my mom up
[35:12] here
[35:17] okay
[35:18] so i like to look at this thought a
[35:19] woman that fears the lord shall be
[35:21] praised
[35:23] we'll just take uh
[35:24] i might preach a whole two hours today
[35:26] we'll see you know what kind of scene
[35:27] that does
[35:28] because i'm joking but you know i'll try
[35:30] to try to watch the time but at the same
[35:31] time you know we'll see what the lord
[35:34] would like us to
[35:35] feel the inspiration on
[35:38] i shared uh those who weren't here on
[35:40] wednesday night i just shared two great
[35:41] prayers god answered this week it was
[35:43] just really phenomenal for me
[35:46] to see that after four or five years you
[35:49] know we've been praying for the
[35:51] supreme court to overturn roe v wade and
[35:53] it looks like they're going that
[35:54] direction
[35:56] so we're very thankful for that
[35:58] and what a week for that leak to come
[36:00] out i know the enemy meant to do harm
[36:02] with that leak
[36:03] but actually what an encouragement with
[36:04] mother's day coming up praise god
[36:07] you know god always uh reverses satan's
[36:10] plans right say he thinks he's got a
[36:12] head on him or something like that but
[36:14] it's just a great victory it's a it's a
[36:16] it's a sign letting us know we're going
[36:18] in the right direction so i was talking
[36:20] with van yesterday out there i don't
[36:21] know
[36:22] today yet but i was just saying you know
[36:24] those two vindications let me know god
[36:26] is with me
[36:27] and i'm going the right direction
[36:28] because these weren't prayers that were
[36:30] answered the next day these were prayers
[36:32] that were answered years
[36:34] years down the road praise god amen so
[36:36] we're thankful for that let's just keep
[36:37] praying that god will
[36:39] rid this
[36:40] red different parts of this nation no
[36:42] doubt you know if it goes back to the
[36:43] states no doubt uh maybe half the states
[36:46] will have abortions too but also but
[36:48] think about if half the state stop it
[36:50] what a blessing
[36:52] god's face would shine upon those
[36:54] those areas praise god
[36:56] and so that's what we're praying for
[36:59] and i was thinking today if god would
[37:00] have spared sodom for ten righteous
[37:02] souls
[37:03] what is he gonna spare us for
[37:05] praise the
[37:06] lord that's why the bible says there's
[37:08] got to be a time right before the
[37:09] rapture when no more people want the
[37:11] holy ghost
[37:13] but all those that want it they'll
[37:14] receive it by the grace of god
[37:16] hallelujah look we got one two three
[37:18] four five six ninety nine we have way
[37:20] more than ten here today by god's grace
[37:21] i love jesus christ i want to serve him
[37:24] and uh it's just an encouragement church
[37:26] that god hears our prayers the other one
[37:27] by the amen was a few
[37:30] it would have been let's see this is the
[37:31] fifth month fifth sixth sentence so
[37:33] seven months ago i sent a letter to a
[37:35] man who preached at cam's church
[37:37] showing him 24 false doctrines that he
[37:39] taught
[37:41] well i talked to kim two nights ago i
[37:42] talked to cam we had to talk about an
[37:44] hour and a half maybe hour fifteen
[37:47] and uh
[37:48] cam said that brother cameron was going
[37:50] to be nice and give one more time to
[37:51] maybe repent make things right well he
[37:53] came and i guess he doubled down on his
[37:55] thoughts
[37:56] and uh cam said his whole sermon was to
[37:58] prove me wrong
[38:00] uh that i was wrong you know i never i i
[38:03] wrote it with love i mean i wrote the
[38:04] letter of love i don't know why
[38:06] but uh i think it's just that the spirit
[38:08] of pride doesn't like to be corrected
[38:10] it doesn't like to be called out
[38:12] when someone has a demon
[38:14] no matter what the level of
[38:17] possession it is that demon does not
[38:18] like to be called out
[38:22] so the brother preached it brother cans
[38:24] recently and said to vindicate that my
[38:26] doctrine is right god's going to raise
[38:28] up brother mike mccloskey out of his
[38:30] wheelchair in this service
[38:32] well god didn't do it
[38:34] they prayed they were they had a six and
[38:36] a half hour service can you imagine that
[38:38] i think i've been in five hour services
[38:40] i don't think i've ever been in six and
[38:42] a half in other words they kept trying
[38:43] to pray
[38:44] when it happen
[38:46] and the brother ultimately tried to put
[38:47] it on other people and mike himself
[38:50] but mike i talked to him on the phone
[38:52] mike's like oh no i know jesus loves me
[38:54] i know if god wants to heal it's going
[38:56] to be god
[38:57] and so i said thank god that you didn't
[38:59] take that evil spirit trying to condemn
[39:01] you
[39:02] because he's so solid he said i have
[39:03] love for the brother i forgive the
[39:05] brother now that's real christianity
[39:08] so anyways the point was that god
[39:10] vindicated that my desire to correct
[39:12] people
[39:15] and ultimately i told like him to to to
[39:17] protect your church from false doctrine
[39:20] i said ultimately because god had me
[39:22] help start that church
[39:23] and we started it with a day of prayer
[39:25] and fasting and everything
[39:27] and i said just as a vindication that my
[39:29] desire was right plus the hours and
[39:31] hours i put weeks i put into studying
[39:34] that out
[39:35] it's an 18 page letter single spaced
[39:37] that's a lot of that's a lot of typing
[39:39] that's a lot of a lot of writing
[39:41] uh god gave me vindication that i'm on
[39:43] the right road to praise god i'm wanting
[39:46] to correct branham tabernacle wanting to
[39:47] correct believe the sign wanting to
[39:49] correct preachers that preach false
[39:51] doctrine that's the spirit of love
[39:54] love brings correction amen
[39:58] love it brings corrections those are
[39:59] great two great testimonials so one took
[40:01] seven months brother the other one took
[40:02] about four or five years so either way
[40:05] we're rejoicing in god's place amen i'm
[40:07] thankful for god's mercy and his love
[40:10] and so i kind of say it like gideon
[40:12] these are signs that i'm on the right
[40:14] road
[40:15] getting needed all these signs do the
[40:17] perfect will of god to me these are
[40:19] signs letting me know i'm on the right
[40:20] path amen i have not strayed from the
[40:23] path i have not left the faith but i've
[40:25] kept the faith
[40:26] like paul said that's what we all want
[40:28] to say lord i've kept the faith amen
[40:30] so i just thought i'd share a few
[40:32] moments on that by god's grace
[40:34] um so yeah let's look here to the lord
[40:36] here as we
[40:38] preach a little bit hear about the grace
[40:39] of god
[40:41] and again great that brother nia here
[40:43] god bless you man hallelujah sure love
[40:46] you buddy god bless you
[40:48] so let's look at a woman that feared the
[40:49] lord shall be praised we just want to
[40:51] preach on motherhood you know this word
[40:53] in the hebrew praised
[40:55] actually means to commend which means
[40:57] compliment
[40:59] or celebrate which means honor
[41:02] so the bible says a woman that fears the
[41:05] lord shall be honored
[41:07] she shall be complimented and of course
[41:08] the text the whole context of this shows
[41:11] who's going to honor her and who's going
[41:13] to bless her it's going to be her
[41:14] husband and her children praise god
[41:17] hallelujah
[41:19] and so of course you know we'd also know
[41:20] like a grandchildren right grandchildren
[41:22] as well
[41:23] and of course all the saints
[41:26] you know all the saints in the
[41:27] congregation
[41:28] would feel uh the love of a godly woman
[41:31] praise god hallelujah
[41:33] and because that that
[41:35] sister is a as a like jesus said she's a
[41:37] city on a hill that cannot be hidden
[41:40] now especially the way you dress this is
[41:41] we're going to get to that just a minute
[41:42] just encourage you
[41:43] and really appreciate you for that
[41:45] especially nowadays
[41:47] when all these women uh wear these uh
[41:51] what they call them exercise pants where
[41:52] they call yoga pants right
[41:55] it's really close to a state of undress
[41:57] i don't forgot we've got our different
[41:59] ideas on that but um
[42:02] to think about how a woman would put
[42:04] herself out like that and even
[42:05] grandmothers do that
[42:08] and uh they put themselves out in such
[42:10] an ungodly way to think that you as
[42:13] sisters here led by the holy spirit
[42:15] would cover up your your body
[42:17] and would would force people to
[42:19] acknowledge wow there is such a thing as
[42:21] holiness wow there is such a thing as
[42:23] humility there is such a thing as real
[42:25] beauty amen
[42:27] then god is making you a city on a hill
[42:29] that cannot be hidden praise god amen
[42:32] and you know those women and those men
[42:33] are convicted when our sisters walk out
[42:35] there you know they're convicted because
[42:36] they're they're all without excuse
[42:39] there will be no excuse on the day of
[42:40] judgment i didn't know about modesty i
[42:41] didn't know about that any red red blood
[42:44] and blooded man won't be able to witness
[42:45] i knew about it because i felt it right
[42:47] i felt the temptation i felt the test in
[42:49] the
[42:50] and the trials but by the grace of god
[42:52] we were able to overcome and we thank
[42:54] god for our sisters making uh this great
[42:56] sacrifice to be such a testimony for
[42:59] jesus christ today
[43:01] and they deserve compliments they
[43:03] deserve honor the bible said
[43:06] so children make sure you go home and
[43:07] honor your mother
[43:09] and your grandmother i'm looking at
[43:10] where's all that i'm giving them the big
[43:11] eyes
[43:13] we'll make sure we'll do that today by
[43:14] the grace of god
[43:16] make sure you're honored that brother
[43:18] ram did that over and over again uh he
[43:20] said mother is so great
[43:22] and we'll read those quotes later on in
[43:24] today but but so this word praise means
[43:27] doesn't mean to worship but it doesn't
[43:28] mean to honor and compliment them and
[43:30] thank them
[43:32] for what they have done for you praise
[43:34] god now i just want to start again this
[43:36] this woman of course remembers she had
[43:37] the fear of the lord
[43:39] and she had this because she honored god
[43:41] and she honored her husband remember
[43:43] there was two there was two aspects of
[43:44] this fear of the lord and any godly
[43:46] woman today will do the same she'll fear
[43:49] god and she'll respect it and treat her
[43:51] husband good all the days of our life
[43:53] amen if she can choose those things to
[43:56] fear god respect god to honor god to
[43:59] listen to god and she can also love her
[44:01] husband every day and honor him then the
[44:04] bible says she will be praised amen
[44:06] that's her desire
[44:08] remember the man he'll be praised too
[44:10] right
[44:10] if he leads well praise god if he loves
[44:13] his wife as christ loved the church amen
[44:16] hallelujah and he doesn't bring his
[44:18] children unto wrath praise god so he's a
[44:20] he's a loving father but he's also
[44:21] corrective as well
[44:23] but the bible says if they do that they
[44:25] fear the lord they shall be prayed in
[44:27] other words they'll have a great reward
[44:28] in heaven amen
[44:30] now let's just review these some of
[44:32] these are just so beautiful the fear of
[44:34] the lord
[44:35] is to hate evil
[44:37] so a mother that fears god
[44:40] it saddens and grieves her when your
[44:41] children sin
[44:43] right same thing for father if a father
[44:46] fears the lord
[44:47] it grieves him to see his children sin
[44:50] but austin shared a good song with me
[44:51] this week
[44:52] uh what was it called brother how about
[44:55] take the lead take the lead yeah it's a
[44:57] beautiful song if you want to hear it
[44:58] now we can send you a link to it's a
[44:59] nice deal it's on youtube i just thought
[45:01] of that right now it's a beautiful song
[45:03] and the song basically says who will
[45:05] teach the children
[45:06] who will teach them right and wrong
[45:09] it's us
[45:11] the schools aren't going to do it
[45:12] i know because i work in them
[45:15] you know if you've gone to them
[45:17] they'll say you know now it's all
[45:19] positive like you can't say the word not
[45:20] like you should not run out of the hole
[45:22] you got to be positive and said you must
[45:23] walk down the hallway
[45:26] like that's going to make any difference
[45:28] they're six years old they got all this
[45:30] energy it just has uh
[45:33] two cartons of sugary chocolate milk in
[45:35] it
[45:36] how are they gonna run down the hallway
[45:37] i'm sorry how are they gonna walk down
[45:38] the hallway if you're positive they'll
[45:40] walk
[45:42] not always
[45:44] but see the
[45:45] since they kicked out prayers since they
[45:46] kicked out the bible they're left with
[45:48] this they're just they're grabbing for
[45:50] straws anything these are just vain
[45:52] efforts
[45:53] the fear of god is what's going to do it
[45:55] praise god of course that's mixed with
[45:57] the love of god he says sometimes you're
[45:58] strict sometimes you're loving sometimes
[46:00] you're merciful
[46:01] there's a balance and god gives us the
[46:03] wisdom to know which is which
[46:05] but a godly mother hates when her
[46:08] children do evil and i'll say this she
[46:09] hates when she herself does evil
[46:11] like we all do
[46:14] obviously we should hate the garment
[46:15] even spotted with the flesh the bible
[46:17] says in the book of jude that's new
[46:19] testament
[46:20] we should hate our sins
[46:23] so this is so when we say i fear the
[46:25] lord we should hate our sins we should
[46:27] hate our mistakes
[46:29] right
[46:30] and a mother that fears the lord will do
[46:32] that
[46:33] of course we can't force and say
[46:36] tell our children oh you'll never do
[46:37] that again you'll never lie to me again
[46:40] i'm going to put you in the
[46:41] [Music]
[46:47] but we have to understand that we do our
[46:49] part and if we do our part god will do
[46:51] his part
[46:53] proverbs 16 verse 6 by mercy and truth
[46:56] iniquity is purge so we have to show
[46:58] mercy on the children and we're to speak
[47:00] the truth to them in love
[47:02] and by the fear of the lord men depart
[47:04] evil so why do people keep sinning it's
[47:06] because they don't fear god enough
[47:09] they don't fear hell enough
[47:12] they don't fear scandal enough like
[47:14] these preachers that fall they don't
[47:15] fear scandal enough
[47:17] they don't fear uh
[47:20] criticism enough they they they
[47:22] they don't fear guilt enough we should
[47:24] fear sinful things we should have
[47:27] respect for them i'm not going to walk
[47:28] that way i'm going to stay as far away
[47:30] from that as i possibly can amen
[47:33] that's the fear of the lord
[47:36] i'm going to depart from the evil that
[47:37] i've done or thought to do
[47:39] ready
[47:41] praise god and so that's what a mother
[47:42] does a mother helps her children depart
[47:45] from evil
[47:48] and then the bible says once you got
[47:49] that once you got that once you got that
[47:52] now you've got a little bit of wisdom
[47:54] amen
[47:55] because the fear of the lord is what the
[47:57] beginning of wisdom amen that shows how
[48:00] it shows up why we have so many foolish
[48:01] virgin amen
[48:03] right in the churches
[48:04] even message because once they
[48:06] compromise on sin cutting hair makeup
[48:09] sport watching sports
[48:11] smoking drinking all these things
[48:13] wearing shorts once they once they
[48:15] compromise on these things
[48:17] it proves they don't have any wish they
[48:19] can't even get to wisdom because they
[48:21] don't fear god enough to even get the
[48:22] beginning stages of wisdom amen
[48:25] i can't even say it right but i hope the
[48:26] holy spirit
[48:27] relates to you what i'm trying to say
[48:28] amen
[48:30] that's coming fresh here by god's grace
[48:35] the fear of god makes you leave evil
[48:38] the reason we continue sinning or
[48:40] something we're doing wrong is because
[48:42] we don't fear god enough
[48:45] we think god is just going to wink at
[48:46] our sin and right and cuddle us along
[48:48] like a little baby right no he wants it
[48:51] while we are while we are god's children
[48:52] he wants us to grow up into maturity
[48:55] right that's what the stature of a
[48:57] perfect madness what's worse statute it
[48:58] means maturity the maturity of a perfect
[49:01] son or daughter of god amen
[49:03] we're growing and becoming more mature
[49:06] right our discernment should grow so we
[49:08] can exercise discernment between good
[49:10] and evil
[49:11] that's why i talk about the camera so
[49:12] this trial
[49:14] comes to your church god allowed it and
[49:15] i said brother it's a it ends up being a
[49:17] blessing
[49:18] because it lets me know i was discerning
[49:20] the spirit the right way praise god
[49:22] remember this bride she's an invincible
[49:25] army because she can discern between the
[49:27] two spirits and the framework of the
[49:29] church
[49:31] amen in other words we can identify
[49:32] which spirit is leading us which spirit
[49:34] is guiding us which spirit is fighting
[49:36] against us and when we can discern those
[49:38] then we can withstand satan by the love
[49:40] of god amen
[49:42] hallelujah amen
[49:45] that's why
[49:46] trials are just gifts of grace
[49:48] trials look like gifts of grace when i
[49:50] look to jesus
[49:53] thank god amen
[49:55] it's just god's gift to
[49:57] show me where i'm wrong
[49:59] and to help me grow to be more right
[50:02] i don't know because god knows we want
[50:04] to be right amen amen
[50:06] right with god
[50:09] now you have this idea in the new
[50:11] testament too let love be without
[50:13] dissimulation
[50:15] or favoritism right or division
[50:18] okay so we should love all no matter
[50:20] their age or or or
[50:22] gender or or nationality
[50:26] with all sincerity
[50:28] let love be without any of that uh
[50:30] discrimination amen we should just give
[50:32] love freely praise god in the church
[50:34] said amen
[50:35] hate that which is evil cleave to that
[50:38] which is good amen
[50:40] mothers teach us how to do this
[50:43] i still remember the first time i saw
[50:45] mtv was when the spirit of lust came on
[50:47] me and i was in second or third grade i
[50:48] can't remember i wrote about in chapter
[50:49] one in my modesty book
[50:52] i had never before seen mtv i spent the
[50:53] night at my friend his name was seth i
[50:55] spent spent the night at seth's house
[50:57] and we stayed up and i still remember i
[50:59] was i was in second or third grade i
[51:01] still remember seeing those women on
[51:03] that tv they had a tv in their kitchen
[51:05] just a small little tv i still remember
[51:07] seeing women half naked singing and
[51:09] dressing like that and from that moment
[51:11] on i was hooked
[51:13] i was only in second or third grade
[51:15] a brother shared with me this week when
[51:16] the first time he saw
[51:18] pornographic magazines in kindergarten
[51:22] kindergarten i was in second or third
[51:24] what about today were these kids with
[51:26] cell phones and ipads yeah they're
[51:29] probably seen at preschool
[51:32] right
[51:34] and and seen it so early and still is
[51:37] and we can still remember that very
[51:40] moment
[51:41] when that evil spirit come upon us
[51:43] right
[51:44] we can still remember that
[51:48] and so if that and i still remember you
[51:49] know battling that free oh yeah i
[51:51] remember my mom that's why i'm trying to
[51:52] get to my mouth okay so right after
[51:54] watching the mtv i went home and my
[51:55] favorite thing of all was baseball cards
[51:57] right
[51:58] and that's all i loved was baseball
[51:59] cards football cards well one night and
[52:01] i put in the book there
[52:03] my whole family's watching the cosby
[52:04] show which was a sinful show but that's
[52:07] what we did
[52:09] instead of watching cosby boys did that
[52:11] i went to my room and i made my own
[52:12] baseball cards but i put women in with i
[52:14] drew women with bikinis on there
[52:16] and my mom comes in like jesse what are
[52:18] you doing
[52:20] let me see that card
[52:22] and i was so embarrassed i was caught
[52:24] red-handed you ever talk about being
[52:25] caught red-handed i was totally caught
[52:26] right
[52:29] and one thing i appreciate about my mom
[52:30] she didn't rebuke me in front of
[52:31] everybody she just took the car and said
[52:32] come
[52:34] come in the living room with all of us
[52:35] that's one thing i appreciate about my
[52:37] mom she didn't she didn't publicly shame
[52:39] me she never she had never even brought
[52:41] it up after that
[52:43] amen now that might have been because
[52:45] she's so busy with six kids
[52:47] and didn't have the strength to do it
[52:49] but at the same time i loved how she was
[52:52] patient with me that's good
[52:55] and i there and there was a conversation
[52:58] why are you drawing this why are you
[52:59] doing it and it went back to that while
[53:00] i stayed the night at my friend's house
[53:02] god bless brother ray good to see you
[53:04] sir
[53:10] happy mother's day to your wife brother
[53:14] so that was that that was when my mother
[53:18] she intervened with my battle with the
[53:20] spirit of lust in second or third grade
[53:22] and i really you know because i wasn't
[53:24] the message i really didn't get victory
[53:25] over that until i was in college once i
[53:27] came in the message
[53:29] that's when i finally got victory over
[53:31] that amen
[53:32] but see look how satan does he likes to
[53:34] attack when you're young see that that's
[53:36] why i love how god
[53:38] before even before i even second grade
[53:41] before i could even see that tv god had
[53:42] already showed me the love of god
[53:44] through my mother amen
[53:46] she's already taken me to church she's
[53:47] already dedicated me to jesus christ
[53:49] look where i am today servant jesus
[53:51] christ amen
[53:52] that's why brother masters get them that
[53:54] get those children dedicated to jesus
[53:56] before satan gets his dirty hands on him
[53:59] amen
[54:00] we all have to be tested
[54:02] we all have to be tried
[54:04] but when that mother right she sits
[54:06] there and loves you and prays for you
[54:08] and dedicates you to god hallelujah
[54:11] that's a great blessing amen i still
[54:13] remember when lydia was born i remember
[54:14] i was she was there in a plastic
[54:16] container thing they got for babies
[54:18] which looks like something out of a
[54:19] space movie you know
[54:22] it just it's ridiculous
[54:23] i remember sleeping over on there and in
[54:25] the middle of the night she let out a
[54:26] little square
[54:27] right i kind of like crawled up there
[54:29] and just make sure are you okay
[54:32] i just made sure she okay she's all
[54:33] right
[54:34] i went back and laid down and hold on
[54:36] like is she gonna is lily gonna live is
[54:38] she gonna die she's gonna
[54:40] i thought my wife was gonna die the
[54:42] first time she went in labor that's how
[54:44] far removed i was from anything with you
[54:45] know related to labor or medical things
[54:47] you know
[54:48] so far removed from that
[54:51] but you know uh
[54:53] mother's love
[54:55] was there first oh that's right that
[54:57] when i when i moved there to there i i
[54:59] prayed for i said lord jesus i dedicate
[55:01] lydia to you
[55:02] before the devil can get it
[55:06] amen praise god hallelujah praise god
[55:10] praise god
[55:11] so see that mother
[55:13] has this great impact on you praise god
[55:16] amazing impact on on us on us all
[55:19] and so she is to help you hate evil
[55:23] your mother's there to correct you to
[55:25] show you evil's wrong and he was going
[55:26] to lead you the wrong path
[55:29] right because dad ain't going to be
[55:30] there all the time especially if he's
[55:31] working yeah but she's there to teach
[55:34] you to hate evil
[55:37] in other words that wooden spoon or
[55:38] whatever she uses to correct you or that
[55:40] sticker or whatever it is that ruler
[55:42] whatever it is it's there to get you to
[55:44] hate evil amen praise god and that's why
[55:48] the people today love evil because they
[55:50] were never corrected amen yes right it's
[55:52] true
[55:53] that's why there's there was planning to
[55:55] be many uh there was planning to be many
[55:58] crowds and multitudes gathered around
[56:00] churches today against pro-life churches
[56:04] and they were going to protest life
[56:07] and that see it just it shows they never
[56:10] they never were taught their mothers
[56:12] never taught them
[56:13] see this this is the effect people that
[56:16] love murder
[56:18] generations that love murder because
[56:19] their moms didn't love them
[56:22] of course god would still be merciful
[56:23] and try to save them
[56:25] but the
[56:26] but if they don't surrender to that then
[56:27] this compounds generation generation
[56:32] remember brother and talked about it he
[56:33] said he said your grandmother what was
[56:36] in the choir and she
[56:38] brother says your grandmother was a
[56:39] bob-haired woman to cry choir
[56:42] right he said uh he said your mother uh
[56:46] uh painted her face
[56:48] and wore slacks
[56:50] and he says now you're a striptease
[56:53] so went from bob hare in the choir
[56:56] to sit in the chair the next generation
[56:58] with pants on abomination
[57:01] to now sexy dress tempting men all day
[57:06] look at that's just three generations
[57:09] look at the progress but the opposite is
[57:11] true as well amen let me remind satan to
[57:13] the man amen
[57:15] praise god
[57:17] hallelujah
[57:18] if your mother was a godly saint now
[57:20] look at you you're a godly saint and
[57:22] you've learned and god's growing and god
[57:24] is still restored again the bible said
[57:26] elijah shall restore all things amen
[57:29] amen hallelujah
[57:32] and the holy spirit today is restoring
[57:34] all things amen that pertain to life and
[57:37] godliness
[57:38] [Applause]
[57:46] look where we stand today praise god
[57:48] hallelujah
[57:49] thank god praise god these godly mothers
[57:53] godly fathers
[57:55] think where we would be if it wasn't for
[57:56] that we'd be out there protesting life
[57:58] we'd be on the side of death they are
[58:00] literally on the side of death rejoicing
[58:03] over death singing about death loving
[58:05] death why so they can live a wicked
[58:07] lifestyle because they're lovers of
[58:09] themselves more than lovers of god but
[58:12] we hate ourselves as far as our flesh
[58:14] amen we hate our sinful nature we hate
[58:16] that part of us and we are lovers of god
[58:19] we're lovers of jesus lovers of the word
[58:21] lovers of the holy ghost lovers are
[58:23] repent lovers of godliness amen amen
[58:27] glory
[58:29] and if god if you have the holy spirit
[58:31] work in your life he'll lead you from
[58:33] all appearance of evil amen he'll lead
[58:36] you away from evil
[58:38] like your mother is trying to point you
[58:40] to
[58:41] all those children i should have i
[58:42] should have heard amen
[58:45] maybe i'll get next sunday now
[58:48] so our scripture was this
[58:52] now who wrote proverbs again
[58:54] solomon
[58:56] i'm going to bring a thought out at the
[58:57] end just remember that who wrote it
[58:59] when do you write it beginning middle or
[59:02] end of his life beginning he was on fire
[59:04] for god
[59:06] he was warning everybody against idols
[59:08] he's warned everybody against
[59:10] prostitutes
[59:12] but by the end of his life what did he
[59:14] do he made a prostitute against god he
[59:16] built houses of worship spiritual
[59:18] prostitute unto god to every one of his
[59:21] 100 i'm sorry a thousand wives 300 wives
[59:24] 700 concubines
[59:26] he built a house to all their gods and
[59:28] when he do he didn't live he did it
[59:31] he didn't apply the wisdom gift that god
[59:33] had given to him
[59:35] he didn't invest all the way
[59:37] he stopped investing he stopped fearing
[59:39] the lord he thought i'm so great i'm so
[59:42] gifted i'm so tempted i don't need to
[59:43] keep holding myself may god help us to
[59:45] always hover ourselves no matter no
[59:47] matter how gifted no matter how much
[59:48] you're blessed no matter how many
[59:49] testimonies we have we must keep humble
[59:51] ourselves amen we must be faithful to
[59:53] god and god will bless us amen
[59:56] but if not we go the way of
[59:58] solomon true
[1:00:01] we're here he's on fire
[1:00:03] he talks about
[1:00:05] these women are excellent
[1:00:07] they deserve
[1:00:08] compliments yes they deserve but the man
[1:00:11] said
[1:00:12] they deserve to know they're great for
[1:00:14] us
[1:00:15] they do great things for us yes
[1:00:19] that's right
[1:00:20] i love this give her the fruit of her
[1:00:22] hands
[1:00:23] and let her own works praise her
[1:00:25] in the gates

[1:00:29] mom said all that bread she cast on the
[1:00:31] water hallelujah it's gonna come back to
[1:00:33] her

[1:00:35] children uh one day all those two are

[1:01:04] bread upon the water it'll come back to
[1:01:06] you

[1:01:10] it'll come back to you you'll meet them
[1:01:12] on the other side in a perfect body and
[1:01:13] he said they'll thank you over there for
[1:01:15] your testimony he said because you never
[1:01:17] know how far your testimony reaches amen
[1:01:20] and he said it reaches as far as that
[1:01:22] water that waterway once you splash in
[1:01:24] the water and it goes out there that's
[1:01:26] how far your testimony reaches amen
[1:01:30] it reaches in your family those waves
[1:01:32] reach to your job amen they reach in
[1:01:34] your church praise god
[1:01:36] all those waves of influence your
[1:01:38] influence just reverberates amen it's
[1:01:41] constantly uh influencing and hit glory
[1:01:44] your prayers are constantly hitting
[1:01:45] people again
[1:01:47] your prayers are stopping people from
[1:01:48] going to hell amen sure
[1:01:53] yes
[1:01:57] the prayer of faith will save the sick
[1:02:00] what was it god used the prayer god
[1:02:02] anointed you and you accepted the
[1:02:03] anointing and you prayed and god saved
[1:02:05] the sick hallelujah

[1:02:18] and then he calls you an overcomer
[1:02:20] hallelujah
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:25] so see a woman's fear of the lord is
[1:02:27] evident
[1:02:28] it's inside her being and it's also seen
[1:02:31] on the outside
[1:02:34] now i want to say this too
[1:02:36] a woman who fears god still wants to be
[1:02:38] pretty
[1:02:39] so i'm gonna i'm gonna deal with a
[1:02:40] little bit on the outward appearance for
[1:02:41] a few moments okay all right all right
[1:02:44] i mean i guess i wrote a book on it
[1:02:47] to come back to it at some point
[1:02:51] yeah
[1:02:53] bill brandon says you know it's just the
[1:02:54] nature of a woman to want to look pretty
[1:02:56] sure
[1:02:57] she's supposed to be that way yes so
[1:03:00] little girls it's okay to want to look
[1:03:01] pretty
[1:03:02] we think you all look real pretty today
[1:03:04] like i have to tell the girls that's a
[1:03:06] beautiful dress yes i want them to feel
[1:03:08] pretty yeah like i like your hair that
[1:03:10] looks really beautiful today

[1:03:17] sure praise god yeah rodriguez said
[1:03:19] about eve uh adam was one strong fine
[1:03:22] handsome looking man eve was one of the
[1:03:24] most beautiful women the earth ever seen
[1:03:26] probably the most beautiful right sure
[1:03:28] right i'm sure that was the most
[1:03:29] handsome strong man you'd ever want to
[1:03:31] see you know right
[1:03:33] uh that's the way god made them
[1:03:36] right
[1:03:38] and you see this also in the scripture
[1:03:39] you know solomon here when he's young
[1:03:42] see he's singing about one woman here
[1:03:43] not a thousand
[1:03:45] at the end of his life he was singing i
[1:03:47] guess i guess he was singing the blues
[1:03:48] to a thousand wives
[1:03:50] here at the beginning he's singing
[1:03:52] praise and compliments on his only wife
[1:03:55] his first
[1:03:56] wife of course that times the bride yeah
[1:04:00] jesus christ and the pride
[1:04:02] right he says you are all fair my love
[1:04:05] there's no spot in me
[1:04:07] wow
[1:04:08] that's that beautiful
[1:04:09] uh
[1:04:10] honeymoon love can i say it like that
[1:04:13] right you have no spot in you
[1:04:15] you're just perfect for me right
[1:04:18] right
[1:04:19] and so we must remind our sisters and
[1:04:21] our little girls how beautiful god made
[1:04:22] them to be because the bible says
[1:04:25] david said i'm going to praise you
[1:04:26] because i'm fearfully and wonderful
[1:04:28] wonderfully made marvelous are your
[1:04:30] works and that my soul knows right well
[1:04:33] in other words lord i know you gave me
[1:04:34] this life i know you you call me to be a
[1:04:36] boy you call me to be a girl whatever
[1:04:38] you call me to be you've done it well
[1:04:40] you did it masterfully yes
[1:04:43] you blessed me amen by making me a boy
[1:04:45] or making me a girl you blessed me your
[1:04:47] hand's been upon me praise god
[1:04:49] i'm saying this by the blood of jesus
[1:04:51] there is no spot in you amen thank god
[1:04:54] there's no sin spot in you hallelujah
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:58] hallelujah
[1:05:01] because that's the real beauty that
[1:05:02] matters
[1:05:04] now we all want to keep wrinkles away as
[1:05:05] far as we can for as long as we can
[1:05:08] right
[1:05:09] we all want to keep bringing this away
[1:05:11] white hair
[1:05:12] long as we can
[1:05:15] but the real beauty is inward beauty
[1:05:18] praise god
[1:05:20] brother man said now the true thirst a
[1:05:22] woman should have would be to adorn
[1:05:24] themselves in modest apparel and to have
[1:05:26] a christ-like spirit
[1:05:27] first timothy two verse nine
[1:05:29] now that's the way a woman should thirst
[1:05:32] to be how many thirsts for that sisters
[1:05:34] you want to be modest and you want to
[1:05:36] have a christ-like spirit
[1:05:38] now if you want to be pretty that's the
[1:05:39] way
[1:05:40] what makes you pretty see is a
[1:05:41] christ-like spirit and adorned in modest
[1:05:44] apparel that's the truth
[1:05:46] so what does the verse say the verse
[1:05:47] says in life manner women adorn
[1:05:49] yourselves in modest apparel with
[1:05:51] shame-facedness and sobriety right yeah
[1:05:54] so seriousness and shame basically just
[1:05:55] means uh
[1:05:57] just a humble it's just it's a humility
[1:06:00] like you know you would not exalt your
[1:06:02] face you would not be prideful you just
[1:06:03] be a humble
[1:06:05] a humble countenance right
[1:06:08] it doesn't mean like i'm ashamed i can't
[1:06:10] go look at brother jesse i can't shake
[1:06:11] his hand or i can't shake my husband's
[1:06:13] hand or you know that's not what he's
[1:06:14] talking about no
[1:06:16] it's humility yeah you're serious you're
[1:06:19] not all-time joking all the time
[1:06:20] although we like to laugh here we like
[1:06:22] to love the pressure but most times
[1:06:23] we're serious especially in the house of
[1:06:24] god
[1:06:27] and not with broadened hair which in
[1:06:28] those days was a very costly hairstyle
[1:06:31] oh yes right now real man tells us and
[1:06:33] we know that from history braiding hair
[1:06:35] is not sinful but expensive haircut or
[1:06:38] i'm sorry expensive hair dudes because
[1:06:40] we don't believe in women cutting hair
[1:06:41] expensive hairdos are sinful
[1:06:44] right
[1:06:46] just like expensive gold
[1:06:48] pearls and costly things are expensive
[1:06:50] as well
[1:06:52] okay so when we buy such things like
[1:06:54] that they got to be low cost they
[1:06:56] shouldn't be
[1:06:56] in other words you shouldn't spend
[1:06:58] thousands and thousands of dollars on
[1:07:00] some of these things what a waste of
[1:07:01] money
[1:07:02] what a waste of money
[1:07:04] that's it you could use that to help
[1:07:05] someone feed your family or help a
[1:07:08] neighbor or pay off a bill or something
[1:07:09] like that use it with use wisdom
[1:07:13] because it's that's all in vain
[1:07:15] yes it is it's in vain
[1:07:18] but instead of being uh instead of being
[1:07:20] adorned with expensive hairstyles and
[1:07:22] gold and costing things
[1:07:24] uh
[1:07:25] the bible said women professing
[1:07:27] godliness should be adorned with good
[1:07:28] works
[1:07:30] like teaching your children how to hate
[1:07:32] evil amen
[1:07:33] that's a good work amen
[1:07:36] serving your husband praise god loving
[1:07:37] your husband being good to him all the
[1:07:39] days of your life that's a good work
[1:07:42] paying your tithe give it offerings
[1:07:44] like like brother mj said last week with
[1:07:46] anna having a ministry of prayer and
[1:07:48] fasting for the church that's one
[1:07:50] example
[1:07:52] like tabitha having a clothing ministry
[1:07:53] to close people that need new clothes
[1:07:56] that's a ministry
[1:07:57] be a woman dedicated to good works
[1:08:00] sing song specials amen amen you know do
[1:08:04] what god's called you to do praise god
[1:08:07] be a woman with good works constantly
[1:08:10] speaking of the lord jesus christ your
[1:08:12] life
[1:08:12] manifest the glory of jesus christ amen
[1:08:17] now in the book i got this picture there
[1:08:19] just everybody knows
[1:08:20] the god breaks the body up into five
[1:08:23] parts you have head the breast or bosom
[1:08:25] you have the belly loins and thighs you
[1:08:27] have legs and then feet well these
[1:08:29] verses show how the the bosom area's
[1:08:32] nakedness
[1:08:34] daniel genesis and isaiah show how the
[1:08:36] belly loins and thighs are nakedness
[1:08:41] and then and then you know we're not
[1:08:42] quite sure where the you know brother
[1:08:44] man says pass your knee that's a great
[1:08:45] that's a great advice but in my book i
[1:08:48] just put for wisdom sake you should
[1:08:49] cover from the shoulder down to your
[1:08:51] shin
[1:08:53] that's what i put in the book so i think
[1:08:55] that's the wisest thing to do
[1:08:57] because i think with the shoulder any
[1:08:59] man once he sees an exposed shoulder
[1:09:00] he's thinking about the bra
[1:09:02] like he's tempted by bras
[1:09:04] right brothers
[1:09:06] that that's why you want to cover the
[1:09:07] shoulder
[1:09:08] right
[1:09:09] and you want to you want to your skirt
[1:09:12] to go down somewhere to your shins
[1:09:13] because if you sit down and it goes up
[1:09:15] above your knees and that's that exposes
[1:09:17] the thigh and the bible says that's
[1:09:18] nakedness
[1:09:20] remember i showed you that picture in
[1:09:21] the 1920s in chicago they used to
[1:09:23] measure the women's dr uh swimsuits to
[1:09:25] make sure they were at least six inches
[1:09:28] above the knee they used to have tape
[1:09:30] measure can you imagine
[1:09:31] i would not want that job i'll tell you
[1:09:33] that right now
[1:09:34] let that be for the sinners you know
[1:09:36] they had tape measures literally
[1:09:38] measuring oh no six and a half don't
[1:09:40] change can't come in can't come on the
[1:09:42] beach they're gonna cause men to stumble
[1:09:45] now who's smarter i'll stir that who do
[1:09:47] you think could
[1:09:48] i mean the the center right the sinners
[1:09:49] of this generation are the centers of
[1:09:51] that who's smarter they were a lot
[1:09:52] smarter than the sinners of this
[1:09:53] generation
[1:09:55] right
[1:09:56] now in the book i also put guidelines
[1:09:58] for modesty these are both male and
[1:10:00] female
[1:10:02] men should only wear male garments
[1:10:04] women should only wear women garments
[1:10:07] we should wear loose clothing because we
[1:10:09] don't want it too tight we must be aware
[1:10:11] that our clothing don't get too tight
[1:10:13] especially our sisters
[1:10:15] right
[1:10:17] as far as i know i've never walked to
[1:10:18] the pulpit with a skin skin type shirt
[1:10:20] on you know so
[1:10:21] it would be gross anyway so i'm not
[1:10:22] going to even do it i don't even
[1:10:23] consider it anyway to begin with so
[1:10:26] but you know with our sisters that's the
[1:10:27] thing of temptation
[1:10:29] their clothes are too tight
[1:10:31] you know sisters made by god to be
[1:10:32] beautiful right it's attractive to men
[1:10:35] we've got to make sure the clothes are
[1:10:37] loose
[1:10:38] right right and then cover areas of
[1:10:40] nakedness now the message i think i
[1:10:42] think the errors to be aware of is that
[1:10:44] we don't expose thighs
[1:10:46] and the sisters don't show cleavage
[1:10:49] we should never do that but sometimes
[1:10:50] people get close to the edges
[1:10:53] right especially sisters let me say like
[1:10:55] this if you lean over like that and then
[1:10:57] people can see your cleavage then
[1:10:59] your shirt's too loose yeah you won't
[1:11:01] lose clothing but you don't want it that
[1:11:02] loose
[1:11:04] maybe wear a tight shirt underneath
[1:11:06] yeah right just wisdom
[1:11:08] wisdom
[1:11:09] because we all need reminders praise god
[1:11:12] and brothers too if you re if you see my
[1:11:14] my suit pants are getting a little too
[1:11:15] tight somebody come tell me about that
[1:11:18] i don't think i mean
[1:11:19] we just we've got to be we got to be
[1:11:20] wise it's for male and female yeah
[1:11:24] right
[1:11:25] i try to emphasize that in there that's
[1:11:27] right i mean like i'm on youtube right
[1:11:29] i'm watching a sermon what's the first
[1:11:30] ad that comes up this guy's got no shirt
[1:11:32] on he's got huge muscles he's like which
[1:11:34] one am i gonna eat tonight salad or
[1:11:36] pizza
[1:11:37] i'm like dude get the shirt on man
[1:11:40] but like right that's the temptation
[1:11:42] right so brothers can use their their
[1:11:44] muscles as temptation as well right
[1:11:47] true yeah they're so demon-possessed
[1:11:49] remember it's only demons that take
[1:11:51] clothes off amen
[1:11:53] right remember when the sons of schemer
[1:11:55] tried to cast out devil with the devil
[1:11:56] said i know paul i know jesus who are
[1:11:58] you and the vibes of those demons ripped
[1:12:00] off their clothes
[1:12:02] right
[1:12:03] i'll never forget i think it was around
[1:12:04] the year 2000 brother ray right when i
[1:12:06] come in the message
[1:12:07] they had the summer olympics and the
[1:12:08] women's soccer team was just getting
[1:12:10] popular do you remember that woman she
[1:12:11] scored a goal from the u.s do you
[1:12:13] remember that and she pulled off her
[1:12:14] shirt and she had a bra underneath they
[1:12:16] put it on the cover of sports
[1:12:17] illustrated i'm like what was that that
[1:12:19] was a demonic power
[1:12:21] sure she just had a black sports bra i
[1:12:23] can still i can still see that
[1:12:25] unfortunately you know we're scarred by
[1:12:26] these things i can still see this cover
[1:12:28] the sports illustrated she's like this
[1:12:29] and she's got her shirt off and it's
[1:12:31] just a sports bra now of course they've
[1:12:32] done wicked things like that all through
[1:12:33] the year you know the swimsuit editions
[1:12:35] and things like that
[1:12:37] satan is the one who's telling them to
[1:12:38] take out their clothes
[1:12:40] hallelujah
[1:12:42] but god is telling us put them on amen
[1:12:45] be modest in your clothing praise god
[1:12:49] and then wear thick clothing or multiple
[1:12:51] layers of clothing because remember adam
[1:12:53] and eve they just had lambskins which is
[1:12:55] thick clothing
[1:12:57] they were wearing lambskins couldn't see
[1:12:59] through them yeah so like brawls visible
[1:13:01] today that's where message people got to
[1:13:03] watch out you know you just don't want
[1:13:04] to do that
[1:13:05] or brothers you don't want such a thin
[1:13:06] shirt where everybody can see your big
[1:13:07] muscles popping out of there
[1:13:09] right
[1:13:11] i hope it's not i hope it hasn't
[1:13:13] happened here you know
[1:13:15] but you wanna you want to use wisdom
[1:13:18] right it's for male and female i've
[1:13:20] always tried to be gracious that way
[1:13:22] i always want to be balanced i don't
[1:13:23] want to preach too hard on the women men
[1:13:25] need it too
[1:13:26] we all need it
[1:13:28] brother don't go to sleep
[1:13:30] hallelujah
[1:13:33] and god because this
[1:13:34] because this sisters god will honor you
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:38] hallelujah
[1:13:39] god will command you god will compliment
[1:13:42] you for this because you turned down the
[1:13:43] demons of this world and you lived
[1:13:45] according to god's will and god's spirit
[1:13:47] and god will honor you one day with
[1:13:49] eternal life amen amen hallelujah amen
[1:13:55] and then also i remember i put remember
[1:13:57] i put in the book as well there's that
[1:13:59] honor your body guideline where we don't
[1:14:00] do tattoos and body piercings right
[1:14:03] because demons are the ones that cut
[1:14:04] themselves right
[1:14:06] a demon cut himself with stone a
[1:14:08] demon-possessed man comes up with stones
[1:14:10] uh the prophets of baal cut themselves
[1:14:12] cry not that's a demon driving people to
[1:14:14] do that right right true but we know
[1:14:17] there's mercy for those who've done it
[1:14:18] right god forgives us all
[1:14:20] right all you have to do is repent and
[1:14:21] then the demon leaves
[1:14:23] hallelujah like i told you that
[1:14:25] testimony i almost got a tattoo before i
[1:14:27] would come in the message but thank god
[1:14:29] i felt some i felt some conviction i
[1:14:31] called my pastor and he put his wife on
[1:14:33] the phone and talked me out of it with a
[1:14:35] leviticus scripture
[1:14:37] isn't that funny the nominations like to
[1:14:39] use uh they say well we're not under the
[1:14:41] law but then they sure like to use the
[1:14:42] law with me
[1:14:43] yeah right
[1:14:44] yeah oh yeah the same people say oh
[1:14:47] women don't have to wear skirts but they
[1:14:49] just use the law to tell me not to see
[1:14:51] the contradiction they use the law but
[1:14:53] they pick and choose when they want to
[1:14:55] see we're not look we're not under the
[1:14:57] law but we're under the spirit of god
[1:14:59] praise god
[1:15:00] we're under the spirit of holiness
[1:15:02] praise god
[1:15:03] and the bible says in romans 8 we
[1:15:05] fulfill the righteousness of the lord
[1:15:07] praise
[1:15:08] god that's true
[1:15:10] so those holy commands that remain the
[1:15:12] holy commands god carries over we
[1:15:14] fulfill those not by legalism no
[1:15:17] not not not by any human effort but by
[1:15:20] the love of god in our hearts amen
[1:15:23] like on some of the austin i think it
[1:15:24] was awesome the other day
[1:15:25] no i don't care i said these people
[1:15:27] don't even know what legalism is
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:31] legalism is adding to the bible
[1:15:34] adding some human command onto the bible
[1:15:37] but if the bible says it that's not
[1:15:39] legalism that's obedience
[1:15:40] right
[1:15:42] the church said amen amen
[1:15:45] so you either have obedience or you have
[1:15:47] legalism on this side they add and add
[1:15:49] or they have legitiousness jude says
[1:15:53] so i i just made it easy there's three
[1:15:55] elves either love god and obey or you're
[1:15:57] into legalism you add or lasheviousness
[1:15:59] the says um makes the turns the
[1:16:01] grace of god into lasheviousness amen
[1:16:03] right
[1:16:04] lawlessness
[1:16:06] the shittiestness is lawlessness oh you
[1:16:08] can do whatever you want you're going to
[1:16:09] be saved and you're going to be forgiven
[1:16:10] well only so far it only goes so far
[1:16:14] if you're willing to repent hallelujah
[1:16:16] let's choose love let's use that middle
[1:16:18] of the road praise god amen let's choose
[1:16:20] love by the grace of god amen
[1:16:23] now our sisters also because they like
[1:16:25] to be pretty
[1:16:26] uh that's a great thing and our brothers
[1:16:28] do but we've got to choose
[1:16:30] to honor god with our bodies and that's
[1:16:31] where a lot of people fail today they
[1:16:34] don't honor god in their body
[1:16:37] the bible says you're bought with a
[1:16:38] price therefore glorify god in your body
[1:16:41] in your body and the church said amen
[1:16:44] and in your spirit your mind
[1:16:46] so you have to purposely honor god with
[1:16:49] your body say this body is not mine it
[1:16:51] was bought with a price
[1:16:53] i've got to take care of this body
[1:16:55] and i'm going to take care of my mind i
[1:16:57] got to make sure i meditate and think
[1:16:58] about and and
[1:17:01] imagine all good things that god has god
[1:17:04] has given to me
[1:17:05] amen
[1:17:06] five verses later he says this every man
[1:17:08] that strives for the mastery
[1:17:10] is temperate in all things everybody say
[1:17:13] all can we all say
[1:17:14] oh oh that means self-control in every
[1:17:17] area of your life
[1:17:18] now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[1:17:20] crown but we an uncomfortable crowd so
[1:17:23] we are trying glory we are trying to win
[1:17:25] a race this morning amen
[1:17:28] i'm here running a race praise god i'm
[1:17:30] here you're here to win a prize that god
[1:17:34] has set before you praise god
[1:17:37] you're here running a marathon this
[1:17:39] morning amen amen you might have started
[1:17:42] out of sprint but then you have to
[1:17:43] realize i gotta humble myself
[1:17:45] i'm gonna wear out before i or i'm gonna
[1:17:46] rust out right now before i wear out
[1:17:48] before i rest out right
[1:17:50] if you don't take care of your body if
[1:17:51] you're just all spiritual all spiritual
[1:17:53] you don't rest your body you don't take
[1:17:55] care of your body you're gonna wear out
[1:17:56] or before you rest out
[1:17:59] we must all earn or we're running a race
[1:18:01] and we must run it with perseverance
[1:18:03] praise god
[1:18:05] and we must learn to be temperate in all
[1:18:07] things
[1:18:10] amen praise god
[1:18:12] so we must control everything that goes
[1:18:14] into our body right let's control
[1:18:15] everything that stays in our mind
[1:18:18] sure
[1:18:19] and if you're born again the soul your
[1:18:20] soul is good just got to feed it every
[1:18:21] day right
[1:18:22] all right remember that verse i was
[1:18:24] listening to a sermon i appreciate it
[1:18:25] brother can just say because i always
[1:18:26] like to what did i preach your camel so
[1:18:28] i don't really preach the same thing you
[1:18:29] know
[1:18:30] if i preach that thought where you have
[1:18:31] three parts with all three parts the
[1:18:33] body's saying feed me feed me feed me
[1:18:37] so is the mind the mind saying feed me
[1:18:39] give me something to think about give me
[1:18:40] imagination conscious memory reason
[1:18:42] affection feed me be me me and then the
[1:18:44] soul saying feed me feed me because
[1:18:45] david said my soul thirsts after god the
[1:18:49] living god
[1:18:51] so all day long you got three people or
[1:18:53] three not three people three parts
[1:18:55] calling feed me feed me feed me feed me
[1:18:58] and what do you feed whichever one you
[1:19:00] feed that's what you'll see the effects
[1:19:01] of amen
[1:19:03] hallelujah so we must feed the soul
[1:19:05] first amen feed your soul the word of
[1:19:07] god
[1:19:08] worship god pray seek god's
[1:19:10] righteousness die daily feed your soul
[1:19:13] the word in church i'll say this the
[1:19:14] rest of it will work out praise god
[1:19:17] hallelujah
[1:19:18] you seek the kingdom of god first
[1:19:20] everything else the bodies come out for
[1:19:22] god will provide amen
[1:19:25] hallelujah
[1:19:29] that's the trouble
[1:19:31] the trouble is when we feed the body too
[1:19:32] much instead of the soul
[1:19:35] or we feed the mind the wrong thoughts
[1:19:39] praise god
[1:19:41] hallelujah
[1:19:43] so we gotta feed them
[1:19:44] a balanced diet
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:48] praise god
[1:19:50] so see daily worship and prayer will
[1:19:52] relieve your stress
[1:19:55] okay
[1:19:56] they've proven that by science i don't
[1:19:58] have the articles but i'd like to go
[1:19:59] find them i've seen them before
[1:20:01] scientists or doctors will test those
[1:20:03] people go to church and those people who
[1:20:04] don't the people that go to church have
[1:20:06] a lot less stress yes it does
[1:20:08] yeah they're kind of feeling all happy
[1:20:10] all the time you know
[1:20:11] smiling all the time
[1:20:13] right
[1:20:14] right hallelujah
[1:20:17] true
[1:20:19] and then for your body drink a lot of
[1:20:20] water and avoid sugar and fast food
[1:20:23] avoid it
[1:20:25] sure if you put trash in you're going to
[1:20:27] get trash out
[1:20:29] right remember i think i told austin
[1:20:30] that brother from iowa he drank diet
[1:20:32] coke all day you can imagine that so his
[1:20:34] body's saying feed me water and he would
[1:20:36] just take a diet coke instead he got so
[1:20:38] bad he couldn't walk upstairs his name's
[1:20:40] brother rich he's still the message he's
[1:20:41] a tremendous brother
[1:20:43] loving brother
[1:20:44] he said one day he was praying and said
[1:20:46] god heal me this arthritis the devil
[1:20:48] told him it was arthritis
[1:20:50] it was just uh aspartame build up in his
[1:20:52] body his bones
[1:20:54] and somebody come around and said well

[1:21:58] germs have the demon in them from
[1:22:00] amsterdam diabetes is chemical
[1:22:03] meaning you're putting too much sugar in
[1:22:05] your body
[1:22:06] chemicals
[1:22:08] and the church says god can change the
[1:22:10] diabetes right away too
[1:22:12] sure but i went on webmd and know what
[1:22:14] they said they said people with type 2
[1:22:16] diabetes can reverse it just by
[1:22:18] exercising and drinking less pop and
[1:22:21] just having a more balanced lifestyle

[1:22:44] god said well don't call for that

[1:22:48] clear lust of the flesh right there yes
[1:22:50] pop and sugar and sweets and all this
[1:22:52] thing your body ain't meant to take that
[1:22:53] all that sugar yeah that's why it's got
[1:22:55] to store it later you know it's going to
[1:22:56] source it for later on
[1:22:57] it makes you overweight
[1:22:59] is that right yeah

[1:23:43] natural old age
[1:23:46] huh
[1:23:47] does it make us think a little bit today
[1:23:49] now most of you know these if you've
[1:23:50] been around for a little bit here you
[1:23:52] know
[1:23:52] just trying to review because that's
[1:23:54] what our mother should do that's what
[1:23:55] our fathers should do we should honor
[1:23:57] god
[1:23:58] my house my body's a temple praise god
[1:24:01] hallelujah
[1:24:04] do you think god wants a debilitated
[1:24:07] temple
[1:24:10] oh he's hanging out in the doctor's
[1:24:12] office instead of in the church missing
[1:24:13] church because you're in the doctor
[1:24:15] you think god wants that
[1:24:17] no
[1:24:17] especially if you know better and you do
[1:24:19] it to yourself
[1:24:23] now we know this too there's also the
[1:24:25] warning due to her beauty though sinful
[1:24:27] men make women into idols i'm gonna do
[1:24:30] it at my time okay
[1:24:33] remember the bible says the sons of god
[1:24:34] saw the daughters of men that they were
[1:24:36] fair and they took them wives of all
[1:24:37] which they chose the lord said my spirit
[1:24:39] shall not always strive with men when
[1:24:41] these men these generations of
[1:24:43] uh i'm sorry the generations that come
[1:24:44] at noah's time when they choose a woman
[1:24:47] just because she's sexy dress god said i
[1:24:49] can stand it no longer
[1:24:51] yeah right of course there's violence in
[1:24:53] the earth there's numerous there's
[1:24:54] numerous uh attributes of those days but
[1:24:56] this was one of the big ones
[1:25:00] you had to be 120 days he says now then
[1:25:03] jesus said as it was in days of noah so
[1:25:05] shall be the days of the son of man
[1:25:07] they eat they drank they married wives
[1:25:09] see they were given america we see the
[1:25:10] same thing
[1:25:11] so it must be the same
[1:25:13] sons of god that should have married
[1:25:15] godly character and said married sexy
[1:25:17] dressed women
[1:25:18] sons of god
[1:25:20] now the only way they can do that is if
[1:25:21] their food's virgin right yeah a real
[1:25:23] holy ghost for a person he'll pray and
[1:25:26] fast right
[1:25:27] he'll pray and fast because he knows
[1:25:28] this is the second greatest decision
[1:25:30] outside of me being saved
[1:25:32] i'm going to pray and fast and make sure
[1:25:34] i choose the right one
[1:25:36] praise god
[1:25:40] see they're not flying you know like a
[1:25:42] holy ghost person they're not flying
[1:25:43] they just don't well see if this works
