blessings in jesus christ's name said amen amen god bless you praise god let's take our bibles here tonight by the grace of god let's go to acts 17 i'd like to continue looking at interracial marriage here tonight i'm sure they're going to need the grace of god tonight i'd like to we're willing to try to get into uh the more difficult aspect of this topic by the grace of god so i surely need god's love and i should i need to grace the lord here but i know i know it's important to preach you know impacts uh like i said it's impacted my life for my whole life at least the first part of it and then it impacts our current church situation by god's grace which we're grateful for all the saints praise god so just something and i think i got three or four people contacting me monday and just said how much they appreciated the service so you know as we just approached the word all of our questions all of our uh concerns are always dissolved by the holy spirit that's right there's always going to be things we don't know like the new name and the day or the hour there's always going to be things we don't know but for simple bible questions thank god that we have the holy spirit for answers praise god amen so again tonight's going to be kind of teaching but i got some good thoughts i'm going to do some preaching next week by god's grace i really want to build your faith next week but i thought well let me hopefully i can finish this thought here tonight my god's great so acts 17 26 if you got your bibles try to preach for an hour maybe maybe a little more we'll kind of see how it goes here acts 17 26 god's love encompasses the nations praise god as we recall his eyes run to and fro upon the whole world he doesn't leave one nation out he doesn't leave any skin color out praise god god is see he loves all the skin colors god he loves all the nations he goes around the world trying to find someone he can show himself strong i heard a preacher say i like the uh baptist preacher i heard him say uh he said god is always recruiting right in the military they have recruiting officers he said god is constantly the main recruiting officer praise god and he use that scripture god's always looking for people around the world someone he can recruit to show himself powerful how do you want to be that praise god i know you signed up already praise god you've been enlisted for a number of years thank god and we just got someone listed last year by god's grace thank the lord for that praise god in church just be patient with the lord you know god he trains men for years to to get them to accomplish his purpose in their life john the baptist had 30 years of training for six months of ministry abraham had 75 years of training for about 100 years of ministry moses 80 years of training for 40 years joseph well third he has 17 years with his family 13 years of training for his ministry so god help us to be patient god help us be patient amen remember the best is always yet to come praise god amen god has a certain ring a certain testimony for for your life and so you serve we serve god patiently waiting on him trusting believing all the word god will accomplish what he wants to accomplish acts 17 26 notice one blood see there's one blood there's only one blood praise god and the life is in the blood praise god so let's read that verse together then we'll have you be seated here one two three and have made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and have determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation now i'm going to read 27 so god determined where you're going to live why verse 27 that they should seek the lord so god placed a man here in akron god placed him in akron here so they would find the lord god placed the saints in ghana so they would find the lord god placed each and every one of us in our place so we would find the lord that's why i did it praise god and it's all men the bible says the bible says if happy they might feel after him so he gave everyone a chance and find him though he be not far from every one of us think of that universe picture from last week sometimes it seems like god is across the universe but the bible says he's very close to us you may be seated god bless you may god is blessing to read his word praise god um i like to uh i won't show quotes yet but i'll eventually get to them and some scriptures but we covered uh sunday how uh we have to really recognize the opinions of brother branham and i believe and i think you believe too that the interracial marriage ban brother had brother branham was against this you know he was against interracial marriage we believe that was his opinion he never said thus saith the lord and what i've found so far i've never seen him use the scripture he never used a scripture it was because of the cultural uh context that he was living in which i'm going to get into tonight i'm going to show some pictures too so uh i'm going to be careful of the children which ones i show you know and what i exactly say because they're young and we want them to be just as innocent as possible by god's grace but we looked at bible teaching we saw five old testament examples where god ordained interracial marriage god did and then i looked at that one i like that one in timothy in the new testament now remember paul said timothy was more like-minded than him than anyone else no one was more like the prophet than timothy and he was a byproduct of an interracial marriage i imagine timothy was shouting when he read that by god's grace wow i'm the most like the prophet you know i'm sure he didn't ask for compliments right like we don't ask for compliments because you know we we don't go seeking compliments we just want god's love in god's favor imagine he was shouting and i imagine that he shouted when he read ephesians 1 4 that says i was chosen in him before the foundation of the world i hear you and then i believe he was shouting when he read acts 17 praise god where god determined my dad would be a greek and my mind would be a jew god determined brought them together and brought me and i got filled with the holy ghost and i'm a son under the prophet praise god that's who we are amen we're sons and daughters under the prophet's ministry praise god prophet brother branham amen hallelujah and of course the prophet paul had to say like that that's not literally like timothy but spiritually praise god because we're preaching the same gospel amen so uh we looked at the positive quotes brother brahm said about zipporah and moses all positive i could not find one negative quote about zephora and moses it was all positive so it seemed like when uh it seemed like this was just a topic that god didn't maybe reveal to brother branham no doubt because of the legal aspect of it probably no doubt because of that and also to protect people in that day because as you'll see if there was interracial couples in certain areas they were they they could be attacked by hateful people i know some of these things are going to be really hard to say tonight it's hard for us as christians to understand that but satan has so gripped people's hearts they have such hatred toward people it's really an advanced stage of pride of life it's an advanced form of pride that someone could have such hatred but there were i mean it's not like it was everybody but there was a small pac packets or pockets of it today just like today a lot of people are very most people don't go to jail today most people are law-abiding citizens but there's pockets where uh say like this where demons are territorial and they'll anoint people with hatred hearts and violent hearts and it's so sad but we're to be the light in the darkness amen and we are by god's grace amen but i believe that explains it if you look at the cultural context but i first want to look at a few scriptures here uh to kind of get us uh uh here on the word of god we looked at those examples okay here we are okay now uh we saw there's one blood of people on the earth so that proves interracial marriages are not hybrid because they're not two separate bloods right they're not two different seeds there's the same blood same seed it's called human seed praise god and they can reproduce a hybrid is one that cannot reproduce itself again like a donkey i just heard brother graham say it today lebron said he said don't blame the donkey on god he said god wouldn't make a donkey laying the donkey on man amen it's hybrid it can't reproduce itself back praise god so if you look at the bible you'll see the bible's plain that all the all mankind all humankind have one blood one seed that produces them praise god and so there's there's there's no teaching on it in the bible praise god uh and so all human blood all human seed is the same seed because it reproduces now remember the bible puts no difference between any race on the earth in the new testament the bible said there's no difference romans 10 12 between the jew and the greek the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him amen amen god is rich to the jew god's rich to the gentile he's rich to the light he's rich to the black he's rich to the yellow brother says rich to the brown amen he's written mercy to all of them praise god amen whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved galatians 3 6-29 says the same you're all children of god by faith in christ jesus there's neither jew nor greek i bet i bet timothy was saying amen on that one right because he was dead his dad was great neither bond or free slave or not now we're getting to that too slavery history of slavery there's neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus amen now romans 2 16 says god will judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to paul's gospel that's right and paul's gospel does not contain a prohibition on interracial marriages it only says you marry in the lord and it only says you marry when you have no living spouse praise god that's what we judge by so see so many message people live in fear it's because they i mean and this is sad they listen to tapes more than they read the bible right now you got to do bowls but brother and i asked for the ramble how do you want to grow in the lord he said read your bible and pray amen amen we should listen to taste we do praise god but see the the trouble happens when people get unbalanced and they worship a man or they worship a tank more than they worship jesus amen all worship though goes to jesus remember galatians 1 6-12 says anyone who changes one word is cursed right so people that don't understand this you know uh they if they're dogmatic about it they're in great danger now there's only one thing i can find one scripture about skin color that's in the song of solomon one verse five and six where the shula might now she was a jew but she worked outside so much that her skin was really dark and she thought that might hurt solomon's opinion of her because she wasn't royalty but solomon when they got engaged and everything he says you're all beautiful amen from the top to the head all the way down to the feet you're all beautiful praise god amen so see skin color was just something that individuals may have had apprehension about but to god it never mattered to solomon didn't matter praise god and to any believer it doesn't matter praise god it's not about your outside condition it's about the inside condition and again if i'm wrong somebody show me in the bible where i'm wrong by paul's gospel and i'll be waiting a long time because nobody will be able to do it by god's grace because i've already read the bible so many times right you have to all these years after the prophet praise god we know what the bible says now just remember galatians 5 9 and 10 jesus's blood redeems every nation every tongue every kindred every people and not only that he redeems us he buys us back he makes us his possession but he makes us kings and priests unto god amen amen so in heaven there's going to be a king who's black there's going to be a king who's white there's going to be a king who's brown hopefully i'm one of them amen that's right church a king and queen a priest of god in every color every nation every tongue that's how god builds his royal priesthood and a hallelujah kingship amen the blood did that hallelujah the blood of jesus still does that amen amen hallelujah amen now let's uh that was pretty fast uh let's do some slides now here well that was to make us all thankful now i'm gonna start getting into the the more difficult things here so i know you love me just bear with me here i just feel like i need to cover it especially you know with austin lena how they love god so much and they've come across the nation to follow us i just think it's good for them by god's grace it's good for me too uh it's been a year since i've actually revisited this subject and numerous people have asked me about on youtube what do you think i just put small little um comments and i actually i actually use a video by jason demars we've had him before it's been years but he has a video about it as what does a really nice job on it uh and so i used his video a lot when i was preparing my video so i'm about halfway done with my video hopefully it'll be out end of this week or next week about interracial marriage so but you know whenever you get into these controversial subjects usually you get rejected remember when i i i don't know i didn't tell you this but when i put out that video about ministers marriage requirements all my views went down a lot of people unsubscribed so all right my page is a lot less popular it's growing very slowly now see because once you once people don't like what you're saying which is okay man that's normal but when you start taking a stand on things people don't like you don't like you done with you that's okay god has a purpose and god's word will not return void that's right amen like i'll never forget right after i posted that video about ministers marriage requirements i had a man say after i watched your video i felt the chains fall from me because i was a slave to that i was slave to that uh idea he said i felt like a huge burden was lifted off me i just want to tell you how much i appreciate that amen the church that's what we live for we live for the truth the truth always sets us free amen so that makes me unpopular well i never was popular to begin with so it just makes me less popular that's good for me right money women popularity but all those are less and less all the time now i'm getting closer to jesus all the time praise god let's look at the cultural context here now i'm not i'm a schoolteacher but i'm not a high school english i'm not a high school history teacher so i can only take you so far now malcolm could probably do a good better job than me on this history but um i just wanna i want to bring this quote on as well um a ban against interracial marriage does not exist from genesis to revelation but yet brother adam said every doctrine must go from genesis to revelation so here's where he says it i mean you're familiar with it you don't really have to read it but he said if every doctrine must come from the word not just one place just and and people on the side that they're against interracial marriage they have no scripture for they have none they just have quotes which if you understand the quotes it's because of the cultural violence and that cultural atmosphere of that time that's what i believe and of course the legal aspect of it and why because now look here's brother important scripture because in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established now also but now with that thought i just want to throw this in here for our our church because we're we're trying to be mature we're supposed to be meat eaters right that's right don't be a spiritual vegetarian okay you can be a natural one if you want for a little while but you're missing out on some good stuff but let's not be spiritual vegetarians amen let's be spiritual me eaters amen now see most of the moral laws of the old testament remain in place in the new testament we're not under the law but many of those laws are actually still morally right or wrong in the new testament that's right like the ten commandments i prove that by the bible it's in my first book the bible said we keep the righteousness of the law so anything that was righteous in the law is kept today by the holy spirit that's right so murder adultery abominations modesty all those things everyone in the old all the moral laws carry over now the jewish ceremonial and sacrificial laws like the priesthood laws they were all fulfilled by christ and no longer required okay so those don't run genesis of revelation those just run genesis to malachi now we're no longer under the curse of the law because jesus took our curse amen the curse was if you break one you're guilty of all and you deserve the punishment of all but jesus took that curse on the cross saying that that's why we were across this sometimes amen because that cross took our targets amen and now we're not cursed we're blessed amen amen now uh i want to say a few things here before we get into the context you're going to see that our nation has come a long way in liberty and freedom because slavery was abolished in 1863 others other civil civilizations like roman empire never got rid of it and i read a stat today on the website i think it was britannica one out of every five romans in the roman empire was a slave can you imagine that 20 of the population would have been slaves that's awful and it was never abolished now look in america yeah we started wrong but look where we've got by god's grace hallelujah and why is that because of the baptism of the holy ghost praise god amen that's why another nation is like that praise god and if they are they followed our example that's right because america was the beast out of the earth now it started off real good like a lamb right but now it's turning into a dragon but start off good brother you got that real cute like real beautiful like a lamb real innocent pure founding fathers amen that's right hallelujah they wrote a document that's still 250 some years later it's the one constitution most countries go through like 20 or 30 or 40 constitutions we've only had one because they were anointed with the man anointing to give us truth hallelujah amen freedom of religion that we can worship jesus christ and jesus sets us free naturally and spiritually praise god he says the natural slaves free amen and the spiritual hallelujah only jesus could do that glory now just so you know paul never taught the slaves in rome or ephesus or any of those provinces of roman empire to violently overthrow slavery but god did anoint americans to do that right it's called the civil war we just went there to gettysburg this summer powerful abs if you get a chance to go there we'll go see sight in town too powerful man you're just a we i just cry cry seeing some of those scenes gettysburg was the the changing point of the civil war still went on for two years after that but that was the tipping point once the south lost that battle it was all downhill and god and each type of church it's a beautiful story it's a three-day battle and every time when it was like when all hope was lost somehow they said it hadn't been god god said reinforcements right at the last moment amen every time it's like we have nothing else we're out of ammunition or we're out of soldiers somebody would just show up because god is always all the time jesus is always on time he's never been late for one appointment so that i'm going to encourage you he's coming to your house too right now hallelujah just keep fighting that's it keep fighting the good fight of faith amen earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints amen amen amen glory to god so see paul never told them to overthrow it but yet there was a season where god anointed americans overthrown get a raise up of lincoln again one book is a child hallelujah i'm sorry two books boxing book of martyrs and the bible hallelujah glory look when it produced a man who would give his life to set the slaves free and keep the country united amen uh history said we were watching there he never was happier than the day he was assassinated hmm it's as if he had he had seen the war come to an end he just been reelected and he'd seen all the wars over slave slavery's going to be abolished she had numerous black friends like frederick douglass some of the smartest people on earth a black man frederick douglass see they're just as smart as anybody praise god guys people are just as smart as everybody else amen but it's spiritual spartans that's the main thing amen he never was happier than the day was the bi uh the history says everybody's looking at him he was smiling he had such a joy about him and that's the day that he went home to be with the lord interesting lord help me to be happy i'm the day i go home with the lord if i if the rapture is not my lifetime let me cross over with joy amen and he crossed over with the happiness and the smile amen for all that jesus done for me praise god hey man now let's look at some uh some of the cultural aspects now here's a brief history now like i said malcolm had a better job than me okay bear with me i am a school teacher but we don't get this deep into history so this is all like history.com and wikipedia and uh hillsdale college they're a good christian college you know now in the 1600s slaves were bought brought to the american colonies we were under great britain's rule that's why it was allowed because we uh the the early americans here they were just they were great britain they were british right uh they had we hadn't established our own country yet so they couldn't stop it it was uh it was ordained by great britain right and also churches so we know slavery is the worst uh most wicked practice of all and sex trafficking is a modern-day slavery it's the modern-day slavery it's just completely wicked just like uh slavery but iran said god doesn't make slaves man makes slaves that's right right now in 1776 we declared war and uh against great britain for our independence that's that holy spirit it's a time for war there's a time for peace and a time for war praise god amen hallelujah and it officially ended two years later in 1778 we visited that where we visited that place as well so now they're officially independent now just so you know church the founding fathers were against slavery but they had to make gradual steps to end it because they had to have the southern states as part of the union as well okay in other words they couldn't defeat great britain if they just had the northern army they had to have because they had a southern part and you know great britain was attacking the south as well so they had to stay united so the founders knew slavery was wrong but they had to they had to realize god this ain't going to change overnight this is going to be a gradual process but if god is with us who can be against us amen amen now some people are are down on the founding fathers well they should not some of them had slaves well i i looked in that a little bit some did have slaves but it was illegal for them to set them free so they're trapped in the habit and they were born into it they didn't choose it they were born into that they were born they're raised having slaves now remember think about paul's day the same thing in paul's day some of them were born in slavery and paul told the slaves he said servants on your masters like you would christ jesus amen and it says masters don't forget to honor your slaves or your servants because christ is the master of you praise god hey and it's all over uh and when thomas jefferson wrote uh the declaration of independence he they didn't even put the word slave in any of their documents because they want they never wanted that a trace of that in the documents if you look at the founding documents and never use the word slave because they had a vision they had a vision that god would eventually take it away praise god hallelujah and what he said he said we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now this man eventually became president was he the third president okay and uh i think it was the third one not just but all along whenever they had a chance they would end a certain part of slavery because it was set up by great britain it was just it was it was the system was set in place and they had to work slowly to change it now in 1803 america established a northwest territory which all all the western states and then jefferson he's the one that wrote all men credit equal he's the president that said there will be no slavery there and both both congress and house passed it so it's like the southern states knew it was wrong and they knew they were eventually gonna have to get rid of it but they still passed it so they were making they were making slow steady changes to get rid of it now in the 1830s to 1860s let me just move to the map here so here's what this was the northwest territory so here we are children here we are uh so in 1803 the northwest territories by law were anti-slavery no slavery okay just to give you an idea these are the states that fought for the north in the civil war these are the states that fought in the south to keep slavery it was divided right like there and then you have these uh border states here border states some of them were pro you know some parts of them were pro-slavery as well just depending on where you went so in the 30s 1830s and 60s there was a greater movement to end slavery and then the civil war went from 1861 to 1865 four years some say up to a million and a half men and women gave their lives this was a huge uh this was a huge stand they had to make lincoln had to make this stand but he knew they because of the south as soon as soon as he was elected the south seceded and they started their own country did you know that they had their own president but lincoln said no we're going to war we're going to keep we're going to stay together so that's kind of what happened there uh just i'm just breezing over history there's billions of millions of details in it i'm just breezing over so you can see it now lincoln freed all the slaves on january 1st 1863 with the emancipation proclamation of course it you know people didn't honor it right away you just you have to have to uh wait for people to honor it you know sometimes you have to enforce laws right because people don't want to respect the laws the 13th amendment officially ended slavery though in 1865. now just to give you an idea i was telling brother williams after church on sunday the military remained segregated until 1948. so i mean my goodness almost 100 years later they were still segregated black military men had to stay there white military men in a separate place because of hard hearts because of pride because of hatred right and because of traditions and the way of life right now just to give you another little brief history the civil rights act of 1964 abolished segregation of public schools and public places i think about that 64. it was mainly southern states right because the north uh the north had abolished it and done away with it beforehand in fact nine northern states uh about slavery right away after they after they established the union nine of them instantly got got rid of slavery we are one of them by god's grace amen thank god and then of course in 2008 barack obama became the first president black president that's a big deal now of course i don't agree with his politics but it's a sign of how how much progress we've made you know uh in church sadly there's always been hatred and racism and they're always will but thank god god can give us new hearts and we can spread the love of jesus christ to every kindred and person every every person we come in contact with like i like brother austin but he was working at that other place he met a ukrainian guy he went out of his way he used the iphone translate to talk to the guy just having conversations here's a man you don't know the language you don't even know but he's going out of his way to be kind to a man from another nation i thought that that's pretty admirable praise god it's pretty admirable because as a christian you have love for everybody praise god you do now i want to show uh just some details here's why i think brother random was against it because this was a very tumultuous or violent time to live in especially in the south not so much in the north especially the south and this is all from history.com there's the website link if you want to link to it it's pretty easy i just typed in civil rights timeline that's all i have it's objective it's really easy now i'm not going to read some of these for the sake of the children okay there's the military secretary segregation desegregation this ended segregation in public schools but it took years and years and years to go into effect in 1954. now here's a really brutal one so i'm not going to say that but just because a black man was interested in a white woman he was murdered okay in mississippi this is 55 this is 10 years before brother brown died and these were just kind of like the highlights that caught national attention now of course this didn't happen all the time but these are some of the examples of the violence that people lit had to live through of course you probably heard of the kkk right huge group huge groups wicked people demon-possessed people right right but you had little pockets of people that were filled with demons like that and brother bam brother man was around that he knew about this he read the papers i remember rosa parks he refused to give that's a good thing that was a good thing she refused to give up her seat and that started a year-long bus boycott and they through that they actually change the laws and then now black people can sit anywhere on the bus isn't that crazy uh all these years later you know how is that even possible that because it's a slow progress of coming out of these traditions and ways of man i sound like this the great britain system right coming out of that but see church we're out of it by god's grace don't forget that praise god god brought us out of it hallelujah amen now they used to block students from black students from entering schools and they'd have to send in national guards troops to let black kids in white schools how sad is that um voter rights for blacks say i mean for years they had to then states would have little laws to prevent blacks from voting and they're working they're paying taxes all these things it's a slow process to change evil hearts sometimes you gotta wait generations to change change things because evil people they don't die right away right uh then they started sit-ins right where they'd sit in a restaurant and it was a form of a non-violent protest those are good things those are all good things i remember ruby she still a lot today ruby bridges was escorted by four federal marshals into a school in new orleans um again more there's a lot of protests a lot of violence in the in the 60s um here's where our governor stopped trying to stop two black students from entering into the university of alabama unbelievable unbelievable i have a dream speech that was not not long after the seals five months after the seven seals were preached now here's some awful things but they would bomb black churches these kkk people they would bomb i mean it was and of course brother graham would know about this you know and he would he would tell them don't intermarry right it was illegal and then there was this uh this violent nature there's a violent spirit around certain groups certain pockets of people it's so so wicked so sad then okay the civil rights act that prevented discrimination uh at the job place okay uh this was off i'm not gonna hear that but many people were killed in this called bloody sunday 1965 very sad very sad um okay i'll probably move and then you know they haven't even have a fair housing act so there's no discrimination against black people for moving into certain places to live in i mean it's just that's how that's how deep sin goes right if you don't if you don't root out that sin right away don't make god help us church may god help us to always root out sin in our lives what i'm saying if not it'll take such a grip it's so long to get it out except to be for the mercy of god in an honest heart god help us to have honest and good hearts amen now let roots of bitterness build up that's right now most of you would smile when i showed this magazine because not because the cover make because you know what's inside the magnet no that's right and this guy's an adulterer that's his second wife but he put away his first wife kind of reminds me of herod and herodias but as i was preparing this message on sunday i thought well there's an article in that magazine and so i'm going to show you some pictures just to get an idea from 1963 remember this is the year of the bombing this was the year of other awful events in this magazine this magazine is just like one big uh propaganda like it's trying to get you to smoke in here it's trying to get you to wear a bikinis in here trying to get you to buy this buy that car but and this is that's what most magazines are they're propaganda to try to get you to buy something well there's major propaganda here in here against the black people which is awful and it breaks it breaks our hearts but i just thought i'd show you that in the very magazine where it caught god amen it caught the mighty angel amen got me down amen that's right it's been proven no man can put that cloud up there it had to be supernatural god put that cloud up there praise god there's six hours of teaching on if you want to watch it i listen to it but at double speed it's quite good and i can't explain it but i just know no man can put it up there the timing and the height and everything it hadn't been supernatural for it so that's the picture we believe we got the picture out there supernatural cloud revelation ten one to seven fulfilled praise god but now we're eight to eleven you and i are eight to eleven praise god don't forget the end we are eight to eleven hallelujah we're gonna prophesy again amen we're gonna eat in the book praise god it's like honey in the mouth but bitter in the belly praise god thank god we got the open book praise god amen amen now here's the first picture now they're they're saying that the black people are are provoking the white cops and that is not the case if you read the article that's not the case they just some of them are there just because they want to eat at white restaurants they want to go to white schools they just want equal they just want equal treatment and some of their some of them are protesting some of those bombings and killings and this article makes the black people ought to be bad now church in every mob or i'm sorry not everybody in every protest i'm sure there are some bad people but if it's a good protest most of the protesters are good people yeah if it's a honest genuine protest and according to the article that's all they were there they were protesting some uh some bombings and some killings and of course who wouldn't i mean if your loved one got something awful happened wouldn't you protest would you go to the cops and try to go to the police office and say what's going on we want justice so in the same magazine now look look they brought the dogs out on just people protesting they're just protesting they don't have weapons in their hands look they rip off his pants they rip off this guy's pants and look what they say the dog attack is their reward look how awful that is this is just is outside that article all these all these worldly magazines it's all propaganda now brother branham identifies the spirit behind this church it's communism brother branham says because that's how communists take over countries they got to pit people against him in order to have a power grab that's how cuba did it church cuba when they when they went communist they had to they had to be against black people now hitler wasn't a communist he was a fascist but that's how hitler got all his power he had segregation against jews that's always the power grab the power grab is to get people against so they fight each other they hate each other see satan's spirit makes you divided god's spirit unites us amen it's awful this is the this is the culture this is the world brother ram had to preach it and lift it now look at this this guy just got sprayed he looks so sad but you're going to see what they say about him so look at these women they were they were doing a sit-in they were just sitting in to try to get rights and they pull drag them by the legs it's just awful that's right in the magazines that's right in the magazine that we all like we don't even realize that's that was that's what was going on in 1963 okay now look what they call this guy they call they call that the face of hatred this is just a propaganda that's not hatred that's i'm standing up for my rights and i'm i want freedom i'm sad because you sprayed me with a hose and i'm not doing anything violent does everybody understand by god's grace now here look they in this article here they they say though these people wagging their fingers here are provoking this warfare just because they're wagging a finger so you have the you know they see they're pointing their fingers and things like that now we don't even know what they're protesting they're probably protesting the bombings and the killings and why to change our laws give us some reading they're probably just doing like that but the propaganda the magazine makes it sound like they deserve that and it's a lie they didn't some of them could even vote some of them could even buy a house when they wanted a certain place where they wanted to buy a house couldn't even eat when they want to eat i mean this is heartbreaking but again look where god has brought us amen thank god amen thank god for his grace and mercy now compare that to the george floyd writes which i don't support what the police officer did that was way too brutal but that guy was breaking the law he had a history of being in jail he never should have kneeled on his knee everybody knows that but look what they did afterwards they burnt down the police that was violent and yet our media today supports that but the media didn't support that then it's flipped right same spirit right the median was was for these and now the media is for these and destruction and death and killing now it's okay to be violent and riot if you're on that side the wicked side and in this one church nobody's burning down nothing nobody's shooting nobody's throwing up those uh cocktails what they call them i can never say that word because i don't do i don't do evil things i just don't think about it very much you know but thank you so see uh see i was propaganda right it's communism and that's what they're trying that's what some of these democrats are trying to do and republicans communism they're trying to bankrupt the nation so everyone has to live off the government they've already said it they said at their summit remember austin they said they said all the people in the world are going to own nothing and be happy they're trying to destroy capitalism they're trying to destroy the american dollar which at some point they're going to accomplish it yeah because of the revelation 13 says yeah but but my prayers are going to go up before that amen hallelujah praise god amen just like i'm praying for abortion and still praise god don't stop praying well i'm here we got to occupy by the grace of god now here's that uh here's the quote where brother says that to show you it's communism not them black people again i'm trying to be uh politically correct that's just the way it was in 64. that's not right now but that's how it wasn't 64. that's how communists always come in and take over they do that in every nation that's how they do it getting you fighting against one another a revolution then they take in it without a shock see if if the communists and the government people can start a revolution then they have a right they can just come in and change things because there's a revolution that's what happened in cuba stalin did that too now was stalin communist yeah i was reading that on the website stalin now what nation was he italy russia okay i got him mixed up with muslim muslims like hitler okay so there are some uh those are some of the famous communists and that's what they always do uh they always get they always make racism a thing they pit the people against each other see brotherhood says they don't want to blow the country up they want it they can wormweed it though they seen a case of doing that and they know the old revolution was they thought they'd start another revolution okay but i said it shows that it is communism not them precious souls that's born the spirit of god so brotherhood calls the black people precious souls that are born again right but he recognized there's politics behind it that's what it is today and that's what it's going to be church right before the rapture they're going to have they're going to have a call where they're going to be able to kill all christians that are real bible-believing christians see it's dividing it's working towards racism towards christians and the church said i mean that's what the bible says it's building this is all building even today it's building to racism against real christians so they can lay down the mark of the beast and kill anyone that descends against them i know it's pretty serious church but i to say it got to say it we may live to see it so brother i made that great observation communists and fascists like hitler so we're going to have to saw these wars and these riots and uh i'm sure not really riots he saw all the the fighting and the killing and the bombing not there wasn't many riots it was it was all it was all the white people doing the wrong things that's from what i can see yeah but these leaders use racial wars to take political power that's what we see a lot of politicians in our country doing today racism and division everything's racist if you believe in the bible you're racist if you believe in uh uh pro-life you're racist i'm not racist i'm just pro-life i just love life i believe babies have a a right to life i believe baby lives matter amen every life matters amen amen hallelujah now i just want to i have to show these and i just want to say some of these are hard to hear some of them may be hard to hear but you hear them on tape eventually if you serve god long enough and you'll just you're like oh my how can you say that well now we can understand how we could say some of these things first of all interracial marriage was illegal and then second of all it was a very it could be a very violent thing to have interracial marriage you could be uh under a lot of stress what's another word for it uh pressure say your safety would be in uh in danger yeah you'd be in danger in certain areas of of the country mostly south okay and now church there are quotes brother ram says let the brown marry the brown so that i thought so now i'm getting to me right so i look at these quotes and and i put myself in there i know i'm not black but i put myself in there i was a part of me on my minority like when i signed up for college i put half hispanic half white is that what that's what i want i got a little extra finances because of that of course we were dirt poor so it helped you know but in other words i look at myself i'm a mix of two nations okay so uh here's the first one so brother ram calls interracial marriage he calls it hybrid he calls it how terrible now that's really hard to it's hard to hard to hear um because they hybrid the people it's a big melting pot i have hundreds of precious colored friends that's born again christians but on this line of segregation and things hybriding the people and he says what kind of a fine christian colored woman would want her baby to be mulatto by a white man no sir it's not right what white woman would want her baby to be mulatto by a colored man god made us what we are let's stay what god made us i believe it's right so does anybody see any scripture in there there's no scripture anybody see any of us hate the lord in there no now member church i know these are i know that they're they're incredibly tough i know but i would be lying if i didn't show them to you that's right do you want me to hide things from you or do you want me to be honest and tell you the truth there's a lot of preachers that hide it right yeah and i'm not trying to say i'm better than anybody i'm not i'm just saying i want to be honest and i love what god's doing for austin right now it's great i love that amen i know that god put timothy's mom and dad together i love that praise god moses the bar we love that but this was a very tumultuous time this was a very the 60s 50s and 60s were a very tumultuous time nuclear wars right there was human missile prices i mean it was it was it was a very scary time to live okay now the rest of them are on evernote so um i'm gonna just detach this here and i'll come back to it okay good i've been preaching 45 minutes okay so let me read a few more just so you have an idea i won't be able to get to all of them because i actually would like to finish this topic tonight but if you have any questions you know i can deal with it again uh even on a sunday night that's why church with everything though brother says the holy spirit directs us to the word of god okay so obviously we can see brother ram didn't know everything brother branham wasn't god brother random wasn't infallible he was a prophet do prophets make mistakes in the bible yeah they don't make mistakes with us say the lord this topic's not thus saith the lord but prophets make mistakes prophets have wrong opinions right nathan nathan had opinion david do all it's in your heart that wasn't the right opinion that was wrong with me now what i would say that quote if it was horrible for black and white to marry then it's horrible for my parents to marry right because we're we're still mixing two different nations so see that's why i put myself in there right and then whenever brother and talks about moses the poor he never calls it horrible he actually rebukes miriam and aaron for speaking against their marriage and he just he he builds up zipporah all the time he says she's the only one that saved his life amen nobody else can save his life just as his wife every time so you have to see its cultural and legal aspects here he's dealing with that's that's how i understand it in church i can be wrong when i do all of these things but that's how i can see it by god's ways does this help him brother austin is it helping my counselor okay in gabriel's uh now this is one of the harder ones here too gabriel's instructions of daniel brother branham says uh men's hearts are failing for fear the handwriting is on the wall racial disintegration so he's talking about how the races were all mixed he says and all kinds of evil going on in the world so bible man calls it evil to enter into america again there's no verses there's no scripture there's no thoughts of the lord so i would if brother man was here i'd ask him brother branham was moses and zipporah was that evil when they married and of course i'm sure if he did in our time he would he would probably say he'd say of course not god ordained [Music] yeah these are these are the hardest quotes i know right these are the hardest ones in uh now in life sermon 1962 brother random he gets into the legal aspect of it he says he says the big boss up here this nation what they say is all right he says uh they asked brother branham being a southerner what do you think about segregation i said it's not for me to say the boss the government said let it be what it is permit them to marry and so forth i said that's up to them as an american i abide by the laws he says this quote is clear he's abiding by the laws now just so you know there's articles there's you can find them online there's a lot of articles where in the south if there was a interracial marriage the cops would break into their home at night and arrest them and take them to jail that's how awful it was they break up homes and families they take the kids off to what are they called children's services or whatever so awful and brother iran knew that so that's why i feel like legal the legal aspect it was a huge aspect of it said to me you ought to leave it the way god had it he made me a white man black men brown men god he's a god of writing let them stay the way god made them that's what i think if i was a black man i want to stay in my class of people if i was chinese yellow i'd want to stay that way being that i'm anglo saxon white let me marry amongst the white teach my children the same and just stay the kind of a flower and the color that god made us at the beginning after all he's the one that made it okay so again any scriptures there no scriptures what about the five interracial marriages i showed you what about the six what about timothy see so it's as if it's just it's as if god didn't allow him to see the full truth all around okay it's just and it's it's similar but not not even close to serious but something similar is like 1977 brother ram thought his whole life by these three predictions i showed you it's on the video too i put a video about it he thought for sure because of these three calculations that the world would be destroyed by 1977 because of three calculations with the old testament and jubilee and everything like that and god let him die and he didn't he didn't have that right because he's human okay so those probably are some of the hardest ones um in another quote from 1963 he said don't cross them up speaking of black and white you get against nature okay but again as i showed you there's only one blood right there's only one blood and god put ethiopian and hebrew together with moses so that's what we'd ask brother brandon now of course we know he he'd say the right thing now because he's got a glorified body right and even brother brandon said his mom didn't brother i'm saying his mom was half indian brother and that's that right i think the man said his mother was half indian native american he said that's why he loved the woods so much so that he was a fourth possibly a fourth native american so it just seemed to be something with the political pressure of that time the cultural pressure and with the legal pressure it just seemed like something he had to stand against now put yourself in that position what advice if you were a preacher and you were impacted millions of people what would you say if you knew they could get arrested well i'd probably say move north you're going to get married move north right that's what i'd say get a job in the north you know because the north you could do that it was allowed i'm sorry no i'm sorry it wasn't until 96. it wasn't yeah i i don't know how it wasn't i don't know if you could i don't know if you get away with it or not but i would i would say move north yeah because that's right the law didn't change until 1967 two years after both of them died now here's another i want to read another hard one just so just so you're aware of it little man we said we should never cross that up speaking of white black red men he said it becomes a hybrid and anything hybrid cannot re-breed itself he says you are ruining the race of people that's a really hard quote you're ruining the race it just means he i think he means like you're just mixing the skin colors or something like that again so i would ask brother branham did moses ruin his race when he took support i was just i mean humbly humbly right that same thing i got asked about not you know 1977 or any other opinion of brother brandon i'd say how many is this is this right exactly is that exactly right but this was the culture this was the time here they're living it i know i know these things are really hard [Music] okay so and then one more quote he calls it wrong he said some some people their children are intermarrying or things that's wrong so he just calls it wrong horrible evil long some really hard things but i never i never see him quoting the scripture okay never seen the quote description can you put my slides back up here so thank you i appreciate everybody uh listening to some of those i know that's really difficult i thought it'd be better to get it from me as you know i love everybody here i love you i do anything for you i could possibly do it and they're these quotes are sitting on the tapes right and as you listen to them you're going to eventually run into them and say well brother jesse you didn't tell me about that so again that's why i love sunday nights if you have any questions we're not afraid of questions we're going to be honest we're going to pray we're going to seek god here we're searching history to try to come to the right conclusion and so church what conclusion do we come to the bible is the absolute amen i'll do something before moving on this is okay there's our little girls here i just want to tell each little girl that they're beautiful okay okay we just seen something god made you beautiful you're fearfully wonderfully made your skin color is beautiful you are all three beautiful god made you beautiful you're fearfully wonderfully made and your skin is beautiful everything about you especially that you love jesus that's the most important thing that makes you you're beautiful you're fearfully wonderful your skin's beautiful especially jesus that's the most beautiful thing son and daughter you're beautiful your skin's beautiful your smile is beautiful you're fearfully wonderful wow [Music] because it's even hard for me because i've been called names i've been called some of those names and i felt bad for being who i was and i wasn't even like a real i was a half minority i wasn't even a full nightmare but they need to know that jesus did something beautiful when he made each of you every skin color is beautiful every single one like that song red and yellow black and white they are precious so i think i'll close here with this oh i don't know i'm always right along praise god and then if anybody has questions after this after i get done then we can take them i'll probably turn off the live stream enough just then people can't hear the questions you know no matter what nation we're from no matter what skin color we have no matter if we're male or female we're all in the resemblance of god and god calls us his beloved amen it's satan that puts people against each other not god god brings people together praise god we are god's beloved here's the scripture that says you you are god's i read this this morning whenever i get discouraged i go in my closet i said where's that paper i preached on those i am statements last year i am loved i roll it out and say yes god loves me i feel like such a failure sometimes but that's the first verse i put at the top of that i belong god loves me amen and he loves every gentile hallelujah just like he loves every jew that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afford prepared unto glory even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also the gentiles as he also said in the book of hosea or oc in the greek i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved praise god and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are my people there shall they be called the children of the living god hallelujah church just keep that in mind you are a child of the living god today amen amen i love this one too at that time church before jesus died you were without i'm sorry as a gentile before the new testament you were without christ you were an alien from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants have promised having no hope without god in the world but now in christ jesus you who are sometimes far off are made nigh by the blood of christ amen amen in other words we were all so far from if we weren't a jew we were all discriminated against we were all segregated against we're all far from any problems far from any blessing but the blood of jesus christ brings all nations all skin colors all male female gender all ages all shapes and sizes brings them all together and places us at the cross hallelujah for he's our peace who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall partition between us having about in his flesh the enmity even the law of the commandments contain the ordinances for to make in himself obtain one new man so making peace now here's the verse we read earlier that they would so god determined where you would live that you would seek the lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also if your opponents have said we are also his offspring amen so when god wanted to have children he made you amen i don't know when god wanted a child he thought of you amen he wrote out your dna brought your mother and father together now i've got the masterpiece amen hallelujah now i've got my offspring praise god i think that's the last one yep and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world so did jesus die just for jews no he died for the entire world he died for us he died for our ancestors he died if we have any if there's a future he died for our future descendants praise god he died for all and hereby that we know jesus if we keep his commands how do we want to keep his commandments praise god amen church this is what i love about god he died for all and if any he'll say anyone who's thirsty i don't care if you're a moabite i don't care if you're harlot drug addict hittite or if you're a sinai like me i was a cinnamon you know sinnerite maybe cinderellic see everyone he died for and he's asking everyone come to me and i'll bring you close my blood will make you close to the you'll have covenants promise you have an inheritance i'll make you a king i'll make you a priest oh by the blood of jesus christ amen amen amen now we don't know their colors right but adam and eve know his wife now his three sons should be right here three sons and there why is she right there yeah that's probably the three right that's probably represented three cents power babel and look you get this beautiful variety look at all these children you've got the beautiful variety of all of it it's every skin color oh they're all smiling they're all beautiful this is what god this is what god does amen amen god is a god of writing all comes out of the genetic code at church you realize you know i was looking at a book this weekend i was actually listening to an author who wrote a book he's a christian he's digging into the facts of dna and he's saying he's saying the dna we all go back to noah's three sons but he said the physical traits of nations have changed over the last six thousand years they change the last four thousand years in other words like chinese may not have always looked like that right english might not always look like that mexicans might not have always looked like that because there's so much change going on in the genetic code but who's the author of all those beautiful faces all those colors that's our god amen our god is awesome let's stand on our feet
