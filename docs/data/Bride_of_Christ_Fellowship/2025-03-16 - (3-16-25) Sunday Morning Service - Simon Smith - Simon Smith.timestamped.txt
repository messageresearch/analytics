[0:00] morning we are uh
[0:03] here uh this week has been extremely I'm
[0:06] sure all you uh Saints who have lives
[0:09] which we all do um things have just it's
[0:14] non-stop uh was it three visited three
[0:18] things yesterday we helped the guy start
[0:20] lifting his roof and then went to a Mr
[0:23] Bub's little thing there then had to go
[0:25] fix my mom's well then Uncle cousin Matt
[0:27] called once his toilet was like so we
[0:29] ran ran ran all day and um but that's
[0:33] like it seems like it's every day now
[0:34] I'm just like Lord how do I slow how do
[0:36] I slow this down how do we we don't want
[0:39] to be that third ground in the parable
[0:41] the
[0:42] sewer where the cares of the world will
[0:45] choke out the fruit amen so we want to
[0:48] be those who are LED of the Lord and
[0:51] um uh as far as we want to help people
[0:54] want to be a blessing to people uh we
[0:56] want to do all those things uh that the
[0:59] Lord uh
[1:01] requires of us I know a time where the
[1:03] prophet of God said he said um he said
[1:06] yeah one time I was in prayer or however
[1:08] and he said he said the Lord had me go
[1:09] and just split wood for a widow sister
[1:12] so and that was his duty for the day was
[1:14] to go split W wood not study not pray
[1:17] not just but go there and help this poor
[1:19] widow woman and you know the Bible says
[1:21] that uh helping the fatherless and
[1:23] helping the widows is True Religion
[1:26] undefiled so saints of God if you can't
[1:28] find nothing to do for the kingdom
[1:31] look for those who don't have a father
[1:33] look for those who their husbands have
[1:35] passed on and focus on those individuals
[1:38] amen there's always people are in need
[1:40] saints of God there are um it's uh I
[1:44] think we Shar had brother um uh Malachi
[1:47] there was stating how the persecution is
[1:51] ramping
[1:53] up it's ramping up uh the last one of
[1:58] the last times I was down in uh nvar
[2:01] Church there brother Levi and brother
[2:03] Ben they asked me to minister on the
[2:06] Jezebel spirit which was the last one
[2:08] I've never taught on it but if you look
[2:10] at what the prophet of God says about
[2:13] that if you look how he speaks on it I
[2:17] was remember was nickan it started with
[2:19] man first he says and then it switched
[2:22] from man to a
[2:24] woman so if and I was as I was thinking
[2:27] on those things and uh trying to teach
[2:30] the best we could by God's grace and
[2:32] yield um first the the thing the the
[2:35] group that hates the word the most is
[2:37] that man that uh nickan system right
[2:40] moves into bism and then but at the end
[2:43] when it comes down to the pure
[2:46] word that Spirit doesn't stay on the the
[2:51] the clergy it jumps on the people now
[2:54] and who's the people it's the church
[2:56] it's the woman see so and and as I was
[2:59] speaking on um Friday night at uh the
[3:02] the house meeting there um I was
[3:06] speaking and and I was looking I was
[3:07] talking to a sister there and I was
[3:08] looking at my wife because she asked
[3:10] brother Simon she asked me a couple
[3:12] questions sister you made it praise the
[3:14] Lord she's feeling
[3:16] great um uh by the grace of God
[3:20] um just showing how when Jesus came to
[3:25] be crucified the people the people
[3:28] gathered and they had they grab the palm
[3:30] trees and worshiping hosana uh him who
[3:33] comes in the name they worshiping him
[3:35] but within four three four week whatever
[3:38] they were say yelling crucified that
[3:40] thing switched that
[3:43] fast true worshippers and it switched
[3:47] that fast it went from what all these
[3:50] nicians what it went to Jezebel just
[3:52] like
[3:53] that so
[3:55] anyhow uh it just shows uh the most the
[3:59] not only the sincerity but we've got to
[4:01] stay with that word uh and and this as
[4:04] we coming into this and as you search
[4:06] the quotes as you look at the scripture
[4:08] this Rapture and the Great Tribulation
[4:09] are just a day
[4:12] away one day separates the bride from
[4:16] the Great Tribulation just one day and
[4:18] we've got to prepare ourselves for that
[4:21] day amen so I mean it we're going to see
[4:24] things get out of control we're going to
[4:26] see as our brothers and sisters and
[4:28] brother Malachi sharing the people the
[4:30] persecution they're not they're not even
[4:31] message Believers they're just standing
[4:33] for Jesus what what they know of Christ
[4:36] a trinity a false baptism but they're
[4:39] still standing for
[4:42] Jesus and they're taking the persecution
[4:44] they're taking that thing and uh may God
[4:47] give us strength we but we know there's
[4:49] a bride that's called that's not called
[4:52] to martyrdom that's not called to death
[4:54] in this hour and SS of God that's why
[4:56] this word has come to prepare a bride to
[4:59] not see death to give us all the
[5:02] spiritual vitamins to give us all the
[5:04] spiritual understanding that we would
[5:06] not see death that we would have we
[5:08] would be able to discern the framework
[5:10] of the church the spirit the two Spirits
[5:12] right and get out of those things amen
[5:14] so uh in saying that that's been on my
[5:17] heart and
[5:19] um yeah that that brother just sent me a
[5:21] picture of that Pastor just got left for
[5:24] dead I'll just say it like that left for
[5:25] dead on the side of the road and being
[5:27] unconscious and um
[5:31] if you don't have anything to pray for
[5:33] pray pray for
[5:35] overseas man we are so blessed here but
[5:38] our time's coming Saints we're going to
[5:40] we're going to have to stand for the
[5:43] word I if I if I could I could read you
[5:45] that quote uh I think it's from the
[5:47] peramine pergan church age
[5:50] sermon if you look at those sermons very
[5:53] inspired very Holy Ghost LED and a lot
[5:56] of speaking in tongues and prophecy came
[5:59] or interpret ation tongues came and he
[6:01] and the Holy Ghost literally said he
[6:03] said they're they're they're planning
[6:04] this night to destroy America he said
[6:07] but when you get into that spot of
[6:08] persecution he says alls I want you to
[6:10] do is testify in my name and stand on
[6:13] the word of God I have to read the quote
[6:14] but he said he he just glorify God in
[6:16] that time just like uh um Paul and Silas
[6:20] were in that prison they just started
[6:21] singing to the Lord Jesus Christ and God
[6:23] came down and freed the
[6:27] captives we must never let those things
[6:29] go don't let those things slip out of
[6:30] our minds May these things become
[6:32] written Epistles on our hearts amen so
[6:37] praise the Lord Saints
[6:38] um know it's kind of like a sobering
[6:41] thought there sobering start
[6:44] uh but this has been on my heart I have
[6:46] not taught this angle at home uh I don't
[6:50] have a whole lot but saints of God we're
[6:51] going to go and see if the Lord would I
[6:53] I want to say what he wants me to
[6:56] say or I'm trying to yield every every
[6:58] service the Lord allows me to minister I
[7:00] want to yield more I want to be able to
[7:03] say not hold back but just say what we
[7:05] need to
[7:06] say um knowing we're all given going to
[7:09] give an account on that day of our
[7:12] actions our words our thoughts
[7:13] especially our thoughts amen anyhow

[7:40] blessing to

[7:49] then we'll say a word of
[7:50] prayer he says I returned and saw Under
[7:53] the Sun that the race is not to the
[7:57] Swift nor the battle to the
[8:00] strong neither yet bread to the
[8:04] wise nor yet riches to Men of
[8:11] understanding nor yet favor to Men of
[8:14] skill he says but time and chance

[9:58] of Jesus Christ amen you may have your
[10:00] seats
[10:06] there so saints of
[10:09] God if you ever have a little root of a
[10:13] root of
[10:14] berness maybe a little rude of jealousy
[10:16] and like why does this brother always do
[10:19] good at this or why do or you look at
[10:22] your coworker uh someone that uh you're
[10:25] boss and you say man how does he get all
[10:27] these things and this and that and uh
[10:29] how come my brother my sister always uh
[10:32] gets a good thing here or a good thing
[10:34] there or SS of God it's all time and
[10:40] chance it's I like this I've met a quite
[10:43] a few rich man that have no
[10:48] wisdom
[10:50] Millionaires and yet don't want a Bible
[10:53] study driving
[10:55] BMWs and use the name of Jesus Christ as
[10:58] a swear word has a curse word
[11:01] constantly has a big bank account and
[11:05] yet the things of God they won't even
[11:07] they don't even want to talk about him I
[11:09] said sir I said he said what about this
[11:11] or that he goes he goes me and my wife
[11:12] he says we don't talk about that even at
[11:15] home and yet he's got such a mind he can
[11:18] make money just like he's at the Federal
[11:20] Reserve print it
[11:21] [Music]
[11:22] off he's got such a mind he knows how to
[11:25] do business
[11:27] deals he knows how to do this how money
[11:29] just falls on the
[11:32] lap but he wants nothing to do with God
[11:36] and I as I've seen these men I I'm just
[11:39] like Lord how come I can't do this how
[11:42] come Lord why don't have you give me a
[11:43] mind like that a business mind for
[11:46] this and than God it always comes back
[11:49] to this
[11:51] scripture it's time and
[11:54] chance why is this sister always uh this
[11:57] sister right here got healed right here
[12:00] why maybe maybe the sister that got
[12:01] healed and you didn't get your healing
[12:03] that time she might have been in
[12:05] condition she might have been praying
[12:07] and fasting setting what getting her
[12:09] heart ready getting her right mind ready
[12:11] for what to receive a healing touch
[12:16] amen because God honors one thing and
[12:19] that's
[12:21] Faith have you fed yourself the word so
[12:24] your faith is Big so your faith is
[12:26] strong that all things are possible have
[12:29] you limited Jesus
[12:33] Christ well how come this brother always
[12:35] has a this Revelation or he man he he
[12:38] always catches this Revelation and I
[12:40] don't catch these
[12:43] Revelations why do some us this why do
[12:46] some catch Revelations and some
[12:48] don't I wish I could be revelated I wish
[12:51] I could read the word and these saints
[12:52] of God in the in Matthew 16 Jesus was
[12:56] preaching a sermon and actually he
[12:59] didn't preach a sermon he just he just
[13:00] said a oneline parable he said Beware of
[13:03] the leaven of the Pharisees and the
[13:05] scribes Beware of the leaven of Herod he
[13:07] said Beware of the leaven he said of
[13:09] those things and the disciples could not
[13:11] understand what he was saying they
[13:13] thought he was talking about natural
[13:14] bread because what they had forgotten to
[13:16] take bread with him as they crossed over
[13:19] and and Jesus saw he noticed they forgot
[13:22] bread and he wanted to bring something
[13:24] along that lines and he said he talked
[13:25] about leav he talked about leav and they
[13:28] they thought in their own own wisdom he
[13:30] was talking about
[13:31] bread but it came to a spot where God
[13:34] actually said he said he why have you
[13:35] not understood these things and then the
[13:38] Bible says at the very end of that
[13:39] portion they said he say then they
[13:41] understood that he was talking about the
[13:44] doctrine and you know what in MA in the
[13:46] Book of Matthew 16 the Bible does not
[13:49] reveal why the disciples could not catch
[13:51] the mind of Christ there but if you turn
[13:53] to the Book of Mark it's revealed why
[13:55] they could not catch the revelation of
[13:58] that parable you know what the r the
[14:00] problem was the B Jesus said he says he
[14:02] say have your hearts become
[14:06] hardened search your hearts I'm telling
[14:09] you as I've as the last three years God
[14:11] has dealt with me so much on the
[14:15] heart everything everything revolves
[14:18] around the condition of your heart
[14:20] because notice if you come to this
[14:22] church and brother Jesse's preaching the
[14:23] true seed when that true seed hits It's
[14:26] hits all of you you are here at every
[14:29] service you're pulling on the word but
[14:32] depending on the condition your heart
[14:34] when that seed hits your heart hits your
[14:36] mind that's what it's going to
[14:38] produce if you have a Stony heart and
[14:40] you you're oh brother Malachi I wish I
[14:44] you're jealous of brother Malakai
[14:45] whatever is being preached and you have
[14:47] jealousy in your heart is not going to
[14:48] produce like someone who who's just like
[14:50] I'm not jealous of brother Malachi I'm
[14:52] just like thankful thank God we have a
[14:54] piano player thank God he's got his
[14:56] fingers like this and like that and he
[14:57] can make the joyful sound I don't have
[14:59] to do it that's his gift right now we
[15:01] can just enjoy and sing and praise God
[15:03] absolutely SS of God yeah that's right
[15:06] see but if you if you're you coming in
[15:08] here and your heart's not in the right
[15:09] condition you will not receive the
[15:11] revelation of the word
[15:14] amen just a little something like that
[15:17] you know what else he said about the
[15:18] hard heart remember the Bible said Jesus
[15:20] he said he came walking on the sea and
[15:23] the disciples are going who is this it
[15:26] looks like Christ they thought it was a
[15:28] ghost
[15:32] and they see this man walking and when
[15:34] it came up it was Jesus and they're
[15:36] like he walks on
[15:39] water but he they just watched him do a
[15:42] miracle where he took these Five Loaves
[15:44] or these these fishes and he multiplied
[15:46] the F and he fed fed the the the 5,000
[15:50] right you know why they had such a hard
[15:52] time with him walking in water but sorry
[15:55] Jesus himself said what he said he says
[15:56] your heart is hard in other words you
[15:59] limited God oh I did this but maybe he
[16:02] can't walk on water SS of God Jesus
[16:04] Christ can do anything amen if there's
[16:06] anything in your life right now that
[16:08] you're battling do not limit God he is
[16:12] more than able think great things I say
[16:15] like this I was just thinking the other
[16:16] day my my my boss text my old boss text
[16:18] me it was 311 that's why my Apprentice
[16:21] died 10 years ago
[16:23] newbie and when he text me I said Lord I
[16:27] believe even right now
[16:29] that you could raise him from the dead
[16:31] and still save
[16:32] him because I believe all things are
[16:36] possible if Jesus at at his at in that
[16:40] Garden he was praying and what he he was
[16:43] he was all Faith there was no doubt in
[16:45] him he was perfect he was the son of God
[16:47] he said Lord if it be possible that this
[16:51] cup pass let it
[16:52] pass he believed that what that he that
[16:55] God could even somehow find a loophole
[16:57] maybe maybe Jesus misinterpreted the
[17:00] word and I didn't have to take this
[17:01] death he did not have to give his life
[17:03] for sacrifice he said Lord if it's
[17:05] possible that I can bypass this why he
[17:07] believed all things were possible but he
[17:09] said he said not my will but thy will be
[17:12] done do not ever limit Jesus
[17:16] Christ because he
[17:19] can amen so as we see this here he says
[17:23] but time and chance happeneth to them
[17:26] all sometimes I Marvel as I'm getting
[17:29] older I'm having realizations I'm seeing
[17:31] pains I've never seen before I'm I'm
[17:34] experiencing things I'm really I'm
[17:35] realizing how fast time goes especially
[17:39] when around my nephews and nieces and
[17:40] I'm just
[17:43] like like this
[17:45] now what happened to me where did I miss
[17:49] this time moves on
[17:53] continually it does not stop it does not
[17:57] wait there there every every second
[18:00] every minute you have an opportunity to
[18:01] do something you have an opportunity to
[18:05] what live choose life or choose death to
[18:08] choose positivity or to choose
[18:10] negativity to to choose Faith or
[18:15] unbelief but we who are the seed of God
[18:18] we're going we're going to choose Faith
[18:19] every
[18:21] time everything written in the scripture
[18:23] for you we believe it SS of God there
[18:26] we're going to have to walk through the
[18:28] valley of the shadow of
[18:29] death but remember it's only a shadow
[18:33] it's going to be a scarecrow because
[18:34] what light is right behind that in other
[18:37] words you the only way you see a shadow
[18:38] is the sun's still out amen and the s o
[18:41] n is still on the scene but an enemy
[18:44] comes up and gets in the way and it
[18:45] looks like he's not there but I'm
[18:46] telling you what Saints he's right there
[18:48] amen he said I'll never leave you nor
[18:50] forsake you amen saints of God take that
[18:53] to the bank amen no matter where you
[18:54] find yourself in fact we were doing that
[18:57] that that house service for C sister
[18:59] Julie witness to a family they're
[19:00] starting to come in they're starting to
[19:01] see the word this and we do song we
[19:03] actually we eat we Fellowship a little
[19:05] bit then we do songs that we're doing
[19:06] these songs I'm looking around all these
[19:08] young children and I think Lord what is
[19:11] their end because I know we I believe
[19:13] we're very
[19:15] close what is their
[19:18] end 10 years old 5 years old four years
[19:21] old I said Lord God what are where are
[19:23] we going to be a year from now and I'm
[19:26] just like Lord please God keep us give
[19:29] us strength God Lord Lord lead us and
[19:32] guide us you said you would lead us and
[19:34] guide us Lord and I believe we have the
[19:36] Holy Ghost and I'm counting on that that
[19:38] he will keep his word amen why we're
[19:40] going to we're going to try the word
[19:42] amen Lord you said and I'm going to
[19:44] count to it and I believe you're going
[19:45] to do it and I know you're going to do
[19:46] it amen that just settles it for me
[19:48] right because we look at the word we
[19:50] might not feel the anointing we might
[19:52] not give a sign or a Wonder however you
[19:54] want to say but if we can just take that
[19:56] word and hold to it saints of God and
[19:58] believe it it's going to
[19:59] happen nothing can stop
[20:02] it amen so uh getting into this here by
[20:05] God's grace I'd like to speak on
[20:07] artificial
[20:10] intelligence I
[20:12] know been watching a lot of Elon Musk
[20:14] lately
[20:16] and Elon
[20:19] Elon what is artificial
[20:22] intelligence they say they're building
[20:24] computers that are going to be so
[20:27] smart they'll be wor do gods they'll
[20:29] know all things like that all the it's
[20:32] already that in Google you just type any
[20:35] question you have an
[20:36] answer now they'll lied to you because I
[20:38] called a couple
[20:39] [Laughter]
[20:41] lies last week I was doing a study and I
[20:43] was studying I was like when did the
[20:44] Catholic church start Google oh as soon
[20:48] as the apostles started on I was like
[20:49] you liar you liar and then I said what
[20:53] was the significance of 325 ad oh
[20:56] nothing it actually started in 500 you
[20:58] love
[21:00] SS of God there's only one truth and
[21:02] that's what the word of God and God what
[21:05] he said his Messenger to tell us the
[21:07] truth
[21:09] amen why because what history is going
[21:11] to be skewed what information's going to
[21:13] be skewed everything's going to be
[21:14] excuse things of God there let every man
[21:16] be a liar and God's word be true amen
[21:19] you have caught the
[21:21] Revelation and nothing can take you once
[21:24] I like this once you see it you can't
[21:26] unsee it
[21:28] right if you're truly revelated you
[21:30] cannot unsee
[21:32] it so what is artificial in intelligence
[21:35] refers to the development of computer
[21:37] systems capable performing tasks that
[21:39] typically require human
[21:44] intelligence such as reasoning learning
[21:48] decisionmaking percep sounds like the
[21:49] spirit realm huh memory what is art
[21:53] artificial intelligence is like this
[21:56] you're like nothing right and all of a
[21:57] sudden a computer guy just starts
[21:59] writing a code starts writing a program
[22:03] and whatever is in the mind of this guy
[22:05] he starts putting in here and then he
[22:08] gets all done with his super code or
[22:09] whatever he does system or whatever
[22:11] software and he pumps it into this thing
[22:14] robot or computer and now that robot
[22:17] that's what they
[22:18] know but they're programmed to reach out
[22:21] and to gather information and then add
[22:23] that information to the knowledge and
[22:26] then they reach out again they gather
[22:27] more information or more intelligence
[22:29] more history more facts or whatever they
[22:31] want to say and then they start growing
[22:33] it becomes self-growing it becomes a
[22:35] cell it becomes a
[22:40] life but it's
[22:43] artificial it's not real it's not real
[22:46] life what are they trying to do they're
[22:48] trying to produce
[22:49] life but we know God is the only one
[22:53] that can create Satan cannot create life
[22:57] he can only pervert life he can only
[23:00] take something that's alive he can only
[23:01] take the materials that God made right
[23:03] here and then produce something that's
[23:05] not in the
[23:09] original tasks that require human
[23:12] intelligence such as reasoning learning
[23:14] decision making and
[23:18] perception deep learning machine
[23:21] learning and natural language processing
[23:23] Technologies all those sort of things
[23:25] right
[23:30] but what's the original I'll say like
[23:32] this what's the original artificial
[23:37] intelligence we're the same
[23:39] way when you're a baby how much did you
[23:42] know when you're a
[23:44] baby sister uh Haven how much did you
[23:47] know when you were baby
[23:49] nothing but you were a sponge born a
[23:52] little baby sponge right and as the baby
[23:55] Spong is Sister Haven's like drinking
[23:57] the milks and looking around at Malai
[23:59] and Lydia walking around she's like
[24:01] she's taking things in and she begins to
[24:05] learn she learns how to adapt to her
[24:10] surroundings but then once maybe say
[24:13] maybe say she's a super genius and she
[24:15] gets as smart as
[24:16] Malachi and now she's like Malachi I
[24:19] already know all the things you
[24:21] know who must I go to now to learn
[24:24] greater
[24:25] things she tapped out she knows
[24:28] everything Malachai knows now she must
[24:30] go to Daddy Daddy what are your uh ways
[24:32] in PJ and Educational Learning and all
[24:35] those sort of things with your PhD or
[24:37] however you and then uh sister Haven
[24:39] learns all that she's like Dad tell me
[24:41] more and he's like I'm tapped
[24:45] out and yet in all her
[24:49] learning she's limited
[24:53] still why because we have artificial
[24:56] intelligence if we're to draw a circle
[24:58] here on the
[25:00] wall just like Kent hovin said we draw a
[25:03] big circle on the
[25:05] wall and all of this circle is all
[25:08] knowledge that's God's brain that's
[25:10] God's intellect all of that and still
[25:13] still be limiting right but let's say we
[25:15] God could put all his intelligence in a
[25:18] circle how much would you really
[25:21] know let me say like this how much do
[25:24] you know about
[25:25] science a little piece of the pie here
[25:29] how much I'm say this how much do you
[25:31] know about
[25:33] Plumbing come on
[25:36] [Laughter]
[25:37] grasshoppers see how limited we are how
[25:39] much do I know about electrical
[25:42] engineering
[25:43] zero can I change the socket absolutely
[25:46] can I wire up a house absolutely but do
[25:48] I understand it
[25:50] no how much do we really
[25:55] know maai how many keys are on the piano
[25:57] I don't even know
[26:00] that how much do you really
[26:03] know so God sends us here and allows us
[26:07] to grow in wisdom as Jesus Christ came
[26:09] he grew what in wisdom and in stature
[26:12] even Christ had to grow in knowledge and
[26:15] understanding but what he had a shift he
[26:17] had the shift one time there's a spot in
[26:20] his life and I was I believe it was
[26:22] early on we had to L learn to lose his
[26:26] mind and take on the the mind of the
[26:28] father because even at 12 years old we
[26:31] find him what at the temple what
[26:33] disputing and talking with the
[26:36] priest and what' he say he says woman he
[26:39] says I'm about my father's
[26:42] business at a young age Christ had
[26:44] already forgot and did not really lean
[26:47] on his own understanding he wanted to be
[26:49] totally led by the holy
[26:52] spirit amen
[26:56] now he says this wisdom which I've have
[26:58] seen also the son it seemed great unto
[27:00] me he said there's a little city and few
[27:02] men within it and there be there came a
[27:05] great king against it and besieged it
[27:07] and great built great Bullocks against
[27:09] it now there was found in it a poor wise
[27:13] man and he by his wisdom delivered the
[27:17] city amen what if this was a city right
[27:20] here what if we were a small group but
[27:22] SS of God one of us has the wisdom to
[27:24] what overcome the enemy amen SS of God
[27:27] he's a and yet no man remember he says
[27:30] and by his wisdom he delivered the
[27:33] city a poor wise
[27:35] man he had no
[27:37] money no no no wi riches no wealth no
[27:41] vast Empire but he God gave him a little
[27:44] wisdom what so the what he could save
[27:46] and God set it
[27:48] up what it say he says he says a poor
[27:52] wise
[27:54] man he was born poor I'm sure or however
[27:59] but one day he found himself poor but
[28:02] his whole life from there he was
[28:03] acquiring
[28:05] wisdom maybe he had time to watch things
[28:09] maybe he didn't have a job he was a
[28:10] beggar however he just watched things he
[28:12] watched people and you can learn a lot
[28:13] by just watching you can learn a lot
[28:16] just by
[28:17] listening I remember one time my I came
[28:19] home one time my dad was living with me
[28:21] and he said s he was he was sitting in
[28:23] the back porch like he always does like
[28:24] this actually sit like this he just sit
[28:27] there on the back pores like this on his
[28:29] on his feet he said fall had not started
[28:33] yet and he's just looking out into the
[28:35] yard and he said he saw one one leaf
[28:38] fall off a
[28:40] tree just like this one leaf and it hit
[28:44] the
[28:45] ground wow he goes it started and he
[28:49] looked back at that tree and another
[28:50] fell he said Simon I watched I sat there
[28:54] all day every leaf fell off that tree
[28:56] that day
[29:00] and I thought how fast can a tree
[29:03] fade and yet we see in the fall some
[29:06] some trees take forever to lose all
[29:08] their leaves some never even lose all
[29:09] the leaves all foring the
[29:12] winter and my dad right there he was
[29:14] gaining wisdom he's like wow a man can
[29:17] die in one day A tree can die in one day
[29:21] others last on death hits him a little
[29:24] bit
[29:25] slower just by what watching not the
[29:28] Bible say he says watch nature and it'll
[29:30] teach
[29:31] thee look at the ants they labor they
[29:33] labor they labor why because winterers
[29:35] comeing we got to go stored up amen he
[29:38] said he said watch watch this watch that
[29:40] he said these things will teach you
[29:41] they'll give you wisdom you will learn
[29:43] from these sort of things amen you can
[29:45] learn a lot from nature
[29:47] sure he says then said I he says wisdom
[29:50] is better than strength so one poor wise
[29:53] man God gave him enough wisdom to dece
[29:56] to defeat or or cast off or whatever
[29:59] what a conquering
[30:01] King so what would you rather
[30:04] have
[30:06] wisdom or do we have power and force and
[30:11] money amen now let's continue
[30:14] here in Proverbs or sorry Psalms 39:5
[30:18] behold thou Hast made my days as a hand
[30:20] breath and my age is as nothing before
[30:22] thee verily every man at his best state
[30:25] is alog together vanity
[30:28] when I was 21 22 5 foot three and a half
[30:32] 125 could run like the wind but not real
[30:34] fast but enough man I thought I had it
[30:37] going
[30:40] on and I'm looking back complete vanity
[30:43] I had no idea what I was even thinking
[30:45] at that
[30:49] age sometimes we think we got to figure
[30:51] it
[30:52] out you give it a couple years as
[30:55] brother R said he a couple passings of
[30:57] the Sun
[30:58] and you'll find out how wise you were
[31:00] back then think about yourself right now
[31:04] and wait another year and say man I was
[31:06] lacking here I wasn't exactly where I
[31:08] needed to be but you at your best state
[31:11] these young men right here they're young
[31:12] they're strong they're they're they they
[31:14] probably should have probably tons of
[31:15] energy at your best
[31:17] state
[31:21] spity at your I like this you get done
[31:23] with the college and you start getting
[31:24] your you get Magnum L and you think
[31:27] you've got all the knowledge you think
[31:28] you're a absolute pure genius uh uh
[31:31] Savant or whatever you say thanks of God
[31:33] at that State you're completely
[31:38] vanity one time I went to hospital we
[31:41] got to a call in the do in the doctor's
[31:44] office doctors nurses they're all right
[31:46] there they said the sink's bad the
[31:48] sink's
[31:49] plugged I go in there and I'm like had
[31:52] to get you know go through my little uh
[31:54] safety orientation however I get in
[31:57] there I'm looking at that sink that
[31:59] kitchen sink where they wash their
[32:01] dishes the doctors nurses is like right
[32:02] up to the
[32:03] brim I'm like man there might be some
[32:06] diseases in here there might be who
[32:08] knows what in here what do they throw
[32:09] down here you
[32:12] know this must be real I mean we're
[32:14] dealing with Doctor these guys are smart
[32:16] and they know must be a real problem so
[32:18] I did I grabbed a big five gallon bucket
[32:20] I put underneath the sink under the Trap
[32:22] I started loosening these things real
[32:23] softly the the nuts there I let the Trap
[32:26] drop
[32:29] very little
[32:31] water what's going on
[32:34] here look on the sink is still
[32:36] completely
[32:39] full I'm like you got roll up my
[32:44] sleeve sure enough the
[32:50] strainer they can they can pull they can
[32:54] literally take our minds and switch them
[32:55] brother but they can't understand
[32:58] understand that when you put that
[32:59] stopper in the sink it's not going to
[33:05] drain WIS man at his best state is alog
[33:08] together
[33:10] vanity I marveled and I
[33:13] said I'm the smartest man in this
[33:16] [Laughter]
[33:22] room
[33:24] see it doesn't
[33:26] matter this means
[33:34] nothing what you think about yourself
[33:37] what you think you could accomplish what
[33:39] you think you have accomplished what
[33:41] things you think you've done for
[33:44] God SS of God we need a refilling of the
[33:47] Holy
[33:48] Ghost who is our example Jesus Christ
[33:52] was our
[33:54] example and you know what Jesus Christ's
[33:56] example was what his mission his life
[33:59] was to what fulfill the father's will am
[34:05] that is pure
[34:08] wisdom that is what we have SS of God we
[34:11] have to get the mind of
[34:13] Christ let me give you some good
[34:15] examples here this I
[34:17] mean let me let let me say like this
[34:20] even right here even right here right
[34:21] right at the fall right at the beginning
[34:23] Adam and Eve knew God before the fall
[34:25] they were in total commun they felt the
[34:27] presence of God God they were Eternal at
[34:29] this time they were not going to die
[34:31] they had perfect health perfect mind
[34:33] there was everything was happy
[34:34] everything was
[34:36] joyful but after the fall look at their
[34:39] first move look at their wisdom how
[34:42] their how their spiritual intuition
[34:44] their discernment kicked in what did
[34:46] they have after right after the
[34:50] fall and the eyes of them both were open
[34:53] and they knew they were naked and they
[34:55] sued sowed fig leaves together and made
[34:58] themselves
[35:01] aprons what's the Fig Tree why they use
[35:04] fig leaves because that's Jewish that
[35:06] represents
[35:07] Israel remember the Fig Tree he said
[35:10] when you see that fig Jesus said Matthew
[35:11] 24 if you see that fig tree blooming
[35:13] who's that fig tree Israel is showing
[35:16] what the Israel that Israeli religion
[35:19] Jewish religion is not going to cut
[35:21] it but now also look at look at what
[35:24] they used they used leaves and not fruit
[35:30] remember the brid tree sermon all those
[35:32] we got the kker the pal room each one of
[35:34] those Spirits each one of those bugs ate
[35:36] something off the bride tree what did
[35:38] they eat first they ate the fruit
[35:43] first he says why he said he said he
[35:45] took away the fruit see the spirit see
[35:48] they had left they had sinned and what
[35:50] the spirit of God had left they could
[35:52] not get the fruits but since they could
[35:54] not get the fruits they could not cover
[35:56] themselves with the spirit anymore they
[35:59] had to go for the leaves and what do the
[36:00] leaves represent
[36:03] Fellowship without the spirit without
[36:06] the
[36:09] fruit well maybe we just got to
[36:11] Fellowship brother and God bless brother
[36:13] maybe just hang out sometime you know
[36:14] fellowship and you know this and this
[36:16] and maybe that's that's what's going to
[36:17] make that's what's going to make God
[36:18] happy so happy he just
[36:20] fellowshipping you can Fellowship you
[36:22] can talk about hunting and fishing you
[36:24] can talk about work you can talk SS of
[36:26] God if it's not about the Holy Ghost if
[36:28] it's not about the word of God that's
[36:29] not the worship God's looking for that's
[36:31] not the fellowship God's looking
[36:38] for and yet that's in their wisdom in
[36:41] their fallen state in their wisdom they
[36:43] thought Fellowship was going to do it oh
[36:46] we'll just cover ourselves with
[36:47] Fellowship we'll just go and do this and
[36:49] have this and have that and just get
[36:50] together and join and eat and have a
[36:52] good time play volleyball and also the
[36:54] fellowship that's not what God's looking
[36:56] for
[36:58] but God had to what he had to take a
[37:00] lamb and wrap them around with lamb
[37:02] skins which represented who Jesus Christ
[37:05] and who is Jesus Christ the
[37:08] word if God wrapped himself in the word
[37:12] in the beginning the logos then what
[37:14] else is he going to wrap his wife in
[37:16] would not he dress his wife in the exact
[37:18] same thing that he's dressed
[37:19] in see that's why he's going to be a
[37:22] word bride in this day
[37:24] amen yes a word bride
[37:28] praise the Lord now let's look
[37:32] here in the process of time that Cain
[37:34] brought the fruits to the ground and
[37:36] offering unto the Lord and Abel he also
[37:38] brought the firstlings of the flock and
[37:40] the fat thereof and the Lord had respect
[37:42] un Abel and to his
[37:46] offering now notice he says now look at
[37:48] Cain and Abel both of them were sincere
[37:50] Cain took by his wisdom after his mother
[37:53] Church
[37:55] Eve so who ate of that tree
[37:58] Eve was first the mother ate that and
[38:00] that inter that like intellectual Fallen
[38:03] wisdom passed on to her
[38:07] son how many knows that Eve was the
[38:09] mother of Cain yeah sure all right his
[38:11] mother he took reasoning see wisdom his
[38:14] own wisdom a beautiful sacrifice he had
[38:17] flowers he had fruit of the field he
[38:19] said surely he was just like he said it
[38:21] was just like Satan said to Eve surely
[38:23] surely God will receive my
[38:25] sacrifice what is God looking for
[38:28] he's looking for a broken and contrite
[38:31] spirit where's that located right in the
[38:35] heart remember the Bible said the meek
[38:37] shall inherit the earth you read them
[38:39] Beatitudes that SS of God that's the
[38:45] bride he's looking for someone so humble
[38:49] so willing to serve his spirit so
[38:52] willing to what lay before the s o
[38:55] n yeah
[38:58] notice a beautiful sacrifice he had
[39:01] flowers fruit of the field he said uh he
[39:04] said just like this Easter will be
[39:06] they'll spend millions of dollars Across
[39:08] the Nation to put Easter flowers on some
[39:10] altars he says altars wasn't made for
[39:13] flowers it was for sacrifice see shows
[39:16] the same old Cain Spirit of Cain
[39:19] right there's one thing there's one
[39:21] thing God wants he wants
[39:23] you he wants to harness your will he
[39:27] wants not to be just God he wants to be
[39:29] your
[39:33] lord now let me let me jump right and
[39:35] what was I like that's why this this
[39:37] section of scripture is so important
[39:39] because brother Bram he said he reveals
[39:41] what they're missing he what Cain was
[39:43] missing was the Revelation that sin came
[39:46] through that
[39:47] blood he missed the revelation of the
[39:50] original
[39:52] sin he thought it was something else he
[39:55] never caught the thought of serpent seed
[39:57] he never understood the fall the mixture
[39:59] of the serpent see why that Revelation
[40:02] so
[40:03] important the original sin Revelation is
[40:06] very very
[40:08] important it shows now let's continue on
[40:11] here by God's
[40:15] grace let me jump
[40:21] there look at this
[40:23] here there's a time where the
[40:25] Philistines were ready to
[40:29] take over Kila or however you want to
[40:31] say that City that Kila
[40:33] City then they told David saying behold
[40:35] the Philistines fight against Kila and
[40:37] they rob the threshing
[40:39] floors notice a situation comes up and
[40:43] attack comes up something unexpected
[40:46] happens in David's life and in the life
[40:49] of a people in the city think about now
[40:50] think about yourselves here too man this
[40:53] came out of nowhere brother Simon I
[40:54] didn't even see this coming what we got
[40:56] a problem
[40:58] therefore David what the first thing he
[41:00] do inquired of the Lord saying shall I
[41:03] go and smite the
[41:06] Philistines Lord do you want me to
[41:08] deliver these people this enem is coming
[41:11] the enemy is not coming after me it's
[41:13] coming after this

[42:08] answered him said arise go down to kila
[42:11] and I will deliver the Philistines into
[42:12] thy hand notice so God so God gives him
[42:15] a thus say the Lord Again David said

[42:25] was a man of God he was anointed by the
[42:27] Holy Ghost he had he could G he could
[42:29] receive the word of God and bring it to
[42:31] the people amen what a Shepherd amen
[42:34] sure he was feeding them good food True
[42:36] Food now notice they went and they
[42:38] fought and they conquered and what God
[42:41] then they stayed in that City now what
[42:43] they had thus say the Lord they went and
[42:45] conquered and now David's like man we
[42:47] got to get here boys we're like Heroes
[42:50] this city is like they're going to we
[42:51] might be king maybe this is where our
[42:53] kingdom will start right here maybe this
[42:55] is where God's going to set set it up
[42:56] right here maybe we'll have a throne
[42:58] right here this will be our city right
[42:59] here the city of
[43:01] David why because what God used us to
[43:03] deliver them how happy were those Saints
[43:05] how how happy were those people in Kila
[43:07] extremely grateful death was right on
[43:10] him and God S A Deliverance hand right
[43:17] there he says now notice and it came to
[43:20] pass and it was told David it was told
[43:23] Saul that David came to kila and Saul
[43:25] said God has delivered him into mine
[43:27] hand for he shut in by entering into a
[43:30] town that that hath Gates and bars and
[43:33] Saul called all the people together to
[43:35] war to go down to kilan and besiege
[43:37] David and his men and David knew that
[43:39] Saul secretly practiced Mischief against
[43:41] him and he said to abathar the priest
[43:44] bring hither the ephod something's
[43:46] coming guys I just have I got this
[43:47] feeling the Lord something in the spirit
[43:49] saying there's there's danger ahead and
[43:51] he was right Saul was fixing to come and
[43:53] get
[43:55] him then to David oh Lord God of Israel
[43:59] thy servant hath certainly heard that
[44:01] Saul seeketh to come to Kad to destroy
[44:03] the city for my sake will the men
[44:06] deliver me up these are the very men
[44:08] that God sent he sent him to save he got
[44:11] thus say the Lord God said go save them
[44:13] David set up he's like living large now
[44:15] he's like he's got it going on and then
[44:17] now another enemy is actually coming for
[44:18] him but hey we're in this people these
[44:21] people will brought protect me I just
[44:22] saved them God used me right here to
[44:24] bring a Deliverance for these people I
[44:27] put my life in jeopardy my blood was on
[44:29] the line my men's blood was on the line
[44:31] if we were to perish our wives our
[44:33] children had no one but we put it on the
[44:34] line because what we had thus sayith the
[44:39] Lord and now the thought enters David
[44:41] will these men if D if if Saul comes
[44:44] will these men betray
[44:48] me will the men of say uh Kila deliver
[44:52] me up into his hand will Saul come down
[44:54] as thy servant ha heard or the or oh
[44:56] Lord God of Israel I beseeched thee tell
[44:58] thy servant the Lord said he will come
[45:00] down and David's like yeah but you
[45:01] didn't answer that first part of the
[45:03] question okay he's coming but uh he said
[45:07] then said David with the men of kilad
[45:08] deliver me he says and my men into the
[45:11] hand of Saul and they said they will
[45:13] deliver thee
[45:16] up in David's own wisdom he could have
[45:19] sat there in that City and be like hey I
[45:22] just saved these guys they owe me one
[45:24] now they're going to join me we'll take
[45:26] Saul on or however what is but he had he
[45:28] could not rely on his own
[45:31] wisdom do you see only the wisdom of God
[45:35] now well brother Simon why would God why
[45:37] would God allow tell David to Def fight
[45:41] to go and save the very city that was
[45:43] going to betray him why would he do
[45:46] that David knows nothing he just sees a
[45:49] he just sees people coming to take down
[45:51] the city he's like Lord what do I do he
[45:53] say go deliver
[45:54] him defeats him now he's safe and sound
[45:57] they're locked in here nothing can get
[45:59] to them and now he hears his enemy now
[46:03] coming why would God do
[46:07] that the wisdom of God far exceeds our
[46:10] wisdom you know the difference between
[46:12] God's wisdom and our wisdom he knows the
[46:14] past he knows the present and he knows
[46:18] the future of every single thing that's
[46:21] going to take
[46:22] place we are so limited realize how
[46:25] limited you are
[46:27] we have plans for tomorrow but what's
[46:30] really going to take
[46:34] place you know why God preserved
[46:37] Kila because Down the Road God was going
[46:40] to
[46:41] use a man from Kila to help rebuild the
[46:48] Temple but God knows the end from the
[46:51] beginning if he would not have Saed them
[46:54] there there had been no this man to
[46:56] fulfill his part
[47:00] God
[47:01] knows he knows
[47:04] things he knows his plan and all David
[47:08] did why do I have to go fight for these
[47:10] people he didn't ask Lord I don't want
[47:12] to do it he just said Lord said go do it
[47:14] and he did it he didn't ask any
[47:16] questions he just went and did it then
[47:19] this thing comes he said Lord they going
[47:20] to betray me he said absolutely going to
[47:21] betray you get out of there he gets out
[47:24] and David's like I don't even know what
[47:25] just took place right here
[47:28] but God
[47:32] did think about
[47:35] lot what was the whole point of
[47:37] lot God told Abraham Abraham leave this
[47:41] country leave your father leave your
[47:42] mother come follow me I'm going to make
[47:44] you a great man I'm I'm going to bless
[47:46] you and anyone that will bless you will
[47:47] be blessed anyone that curs you be
[47:49] cursed yet we find lot join up with
[47:55] them was that the hand of God
[48:00] absolutely we see they separate lot goes
[48:02] down to Sodom God comes down says he
[48:05] boys I'm I'm going to just drop Sodom
[48:06] gomor I'm going to destroy him with uh
[48:09] Brimstone fire
[48:13] right and God brings two angels down
[48:16] delivers pulls lot out his wife
[48:21] turns to Stone Salt I'm sorry salt lot
[48:25] flees with the two daughters we know
[48:27] till it takes place
[48:30] there but did you know there was a seed
[48:32] within a lot called Ruth the
[48:40] moabitas God knows the end from the
[48:44] beginning every single thing is time and
[48:49] chance God knows your every move he he's
[48:53] going to use your failures for something
[48:56] good
[48:57] he's going to use your
[48:59] mistakes to preserve life he's going to
[49:03] use your your every Everything You Think
[49:05] You're lacking all your weaknesses all
[49:08] your human ability that you seem to put
[49:10] in place of the wisdom of God if we try
[49:12] to use our wisdom AB our own ability
[49:14] sints of God we're going to fail but
[49:15] he's going to take those failures and
[49:17] make something out of
[49:25] it see David had artificial ficial
[49:28] intelligence he did not know the mind of
[49:30] God until he sought the Lord but once
[49:33] now now once he got his upgrades from
[49:35] The Mastermind from the mind of Christ
[49:37] he knew what to do he didn't understand
[49:40] it he just knew what to do he didn't
[49:42] know the outcome he just knew what to do
[49:44] amen and SS of God in your lives we got
[49:47] to what find the mind of
[49:49] Christ because it's going to impact
[49:52] things down the
[49:54] road you know you could be such a light
[49:56] then what people will mistake you for
[50:01] christ Prophet God said he said there's
[50:02] coming a time he said where he said the
[50:04] where the bride will be so anointed
[50:06] they'll be walking he is walking
[50:09] Idols the shadows will heal
[50:14] again the bride will come to the stature
[50:17] of of
[50:21] perfection amen now look at
[50:24] this and it came to pass when the king
[50:26] sat in his house and the Lord had given
[50:29] him rest round about all his enemies
[50:31] that the king said to Nathan the prophet
[50:33] now here's the king the anointed David
[50:35] the king the one that killed the the
[50:37] Philistines the one that killed the
[50:38] Giants he had he he killed he slew it
[50:40] all he says now see now I dwell in the
[50:44] house of Cedar but the Ark of God
[50:46] dwelleth within curtains something
[50:48] remember he was a man after God's Own
[50:51] Heart in his heart was bubbling up he
[50:53] says I have such a nice place to live
[50:55] but what about my God what about the one
[50:57] that spared my life time and time again
[50:59] as I saw swords cross right through
[51:02] could have got my throat and God had me
[51:04] duck or that that one brother of Goliath
[51:07] was attacking me and abashi came in and
[51:09] slew him God delivered me from all my
[51:12] enemies
[51:14] amen he said should not God the god of
[51:17] Heaven have a place to live a house here
[51:19] on Earth
[51:21] amen something's bubbling up on him what
[51:24] that anointing to build the temp was
[51:26] getting close was drawing nigh and was
[51:29] striking the king why because he was
[51:31] still communion with the spirit he still
[51:33] what had the type of the Holy Ghost
[51:35] right there and what that Spirit was
[51:36] pressing this pressing this pressing
[51:38] this and now no it's the prophet of God
[51:44] now he speaks out of
[51:47] turn he says go and do all that is nine
[51:50] heart he says for the Lord is with
[51:53] thee the prophet did not seek the Lord
[51:57] all the prophet was looking at was a man
[51:59] that loved God so
[52:01] much and God has brought you from a
[52:03] sheep herder brought you from this gave
[52:06] you uh wives children gave you the
[52:09] kingdom protected you for 20 years
[52:11] running from Saul all these things
[52:13] protected you he gave and he he surely
[52:15] God is with this one I see the anointing
[52:18] on him I see what the movement of the
[52:20] spirit on him I see him all those sort
[52:22] of things God is with you brother amen
[52:24] do it what is what is on your heart God
[52:26] go do it amen cuz you're a man after
[52:28] God's Own Heart The Prophet said
[52:34] it but he failed to seek the word of the
[52:37] Lord because we're limited here in
[52:41] wisdom you and I probably made the same
[52:44] call Pastor Jesse you feel alled to do
[52:47] this go for it
[52:49] absolutely brother the Malai you want to
[52:50] make you God gave you a song and you
[52:52] want to play it for this this and praise
[52:53] the Lord Go sing it absolutely but what
[52:55] does God want
[52:58] you feel led to do this or you feel led
[53:00] to do that you feel burning your heart
[53:02] for lost souls you be burning for this
[53:04] we've got to seek the Lord and find out
[53:06] what to do about
[53:09] it and it came to pass that night that
[53:11] the word of the Lord came unto Nathan
[53:13] saying go and tell thy servant David
[53:15] thus say Lord Thou shalt build shalt
[53:17] thou build me a house to dwell in now we
[53:19] know the answer right God said it's not
[53:21] for you to build he says you're a bloody
[53:23] man he says but your son that comes out
[53:26] of your body he says he will build me a
[53:27] house
[53:29] amen we have to know the mind of
[53:33] God he says he shall build a house for
[53:36] my name and I establish the Throne of
[53:38] his kingdom
[53:39] forever yeah now saints of
[53:45] God we want to
[53:47] become now we're given the re we're
[53:49] given Malachi
[53:51] 4 SS of God there's not been an age
[53:53] there's not been a people on the face of
[53:55] the Earth who who understand the word
[53:57] like you know it right now believe it or
[54:00] not no one has understood the word like
[54:02] you were given this thing was given I I
[54:05] heard brother brother Brook say one time
[54:06] he went and met him and brother Craig
[54:08] met went and met a sister a sister woman
[54:10] preacher and they brought the message in
[54:11] a church age book to him and they called
[54:13] it the wedding ring this is the
[54:14] engagement
[54:15] ring you want to make the Rapture you
[54:17] want to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[54:19] read this do what it says to do in
[54:23] here she turned it down but
[54:30] just like brother B talking to the
[54:32] priest the priest said he says God is in
[54:34] his church and the prophet said he says
[54:37] he says what he says God is in his
[54:39] word if you have a desire in your
[54:43] heart but you don't know which way to go
[54:45] just start
[54:47] reading start seeking the Holy Ghost
[54:50] Lord open this door Lord I want I need
[54:53] this in my life or I desire this because
[54:55] he'll give you the desires of your heart
[54:57] as well if my word abide in you and you
[54:59] abide in my word he say ask what you
[55:06] will but I believe the bride's going to
[55:08] go out with
[55:09] this he says as I was with you and
[55:12] weakness and in fear and much trembling
[55:14] and my speech he says and my preaching
[55:16] was not with enticing words of man's
[55:21] Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[55:24] spirit and Power
[55:28] saints of God this is what we're going
[55:30] out like it should be like that right
[55:34] now let me show you something
[55:37] demonstration of the spirit and power

[55:44] mechanic or
[55:46] however he worked he brother said his
[55:49] hands were all busted up because he
[55:50] working on cars all day trying to get
[55:51] them back in shape they're in accents

[55:55] was so moved by the holy ghost he would
[55:56] take his family and drive 1500 miles
[55:59] every weekend to get to the messages in
[56:02] Jeffersonville he said one day he one
[56:05] day he was at a certain place and he
[56:07] left his car and left the keys in the
[56:09] car he said some boy young boy was in
[56:11] there looking he went there and stole
[56:13] the car he said he came back he's like
[56:15] just hanging real low

[56:22] let's seek the Lord Brother B he didn't
[56:24] know what to do he did not know what to
[56:25] do
[56:26] he said but he knew who one who does
[56:28] know what to
[56:29] do what he do he says he says what I do
[56:31] he says I place the word that promis
[56:34] before God he says Lord God you see my
[56:37] brother's sacrifice you see how he needs
[56:38] his car you see how he's provides for
[56:40] his family cost he said it cost him $70
[56:43] every weekend to go to

[57:42] howling got down there halfway to Bing
[57:44] Kentucky what broke forth the vision the
[57:45] word found
[57:48] him when this SE when these situations
[57:50] happen because they're going to happen
[57:52] did Jesus ever promise promise us a a
[57:54] bed of ease with flowers and rose petals
[57:57] and just walking and skipping down the
[58:00] yellow brick
[58:01] road life is so easy I'm in America I'm
[58:04] in the
[58:05] message no

[58:20] weekend the devil says I don't like his
[58:22] sacrifice anoints a man to go steal it
[58:27] but then all we all they had to do was
[58:29] ask get down to the throne and say Lord
[58:33] please deliver my brother this this was
[58:36] not for brother bam this was not he was
[58:38] this was for somebody else he prayed and
[58:39] said he said Lord you said by Your Word
[58:41] you could ask what you need and Lord he
[58:43] needs his car back he needs it for his
[58:44] family he needs it for his work he needs
[58:45] to go to church Lord he serves you
[58:47] Faithful and he said he sealed it in the
[58:50] name of Jesus Christ you've got to have
[58:53] faith in that he said said a simple
[58:56] prayer in the name of Jesus he ended it
[58:59] with the name of Jesus Christ he sealed
[59:00] it with that because that's our mediator
[59:03] that's our Salvation right there he was
[59:05] the one that shed his blood he was the
[59:06] one that Sent His holy ghost down amen
[59:08] and by the by trusting in the son what
[59:11] he did what it activates the holy spirit
[59:14] because he put Faith in that
[59:18] blood it's all we got to
[59:22] do now almost done here God's
[59:31] grace he says this is this saints of God
[59:33] this is one of my favorite one of my
[59:34] favorite portions of scripture one of
[59:36] them I love this because the holy spirit
[59:40] will never keep you at a milk
[59:42] level as far as Revelation in the Bible
[59:46] Bible Revelation bible understanding
[59:48] he'll never keep you at a
[59:50] milk he'll not let you be a babe for
[59:53] I'll say this when I when I lost
[59:55] everything and uh when I was a heathen
[59:57] in college and I came back to my mom's
[59:58] church it was within one year year and a
[1:00:00] half that was God sent this
[1:00:02] message I had already grown that fast
[1:00:06] under denominational milk to where I'm
[1:00:07] like it's the same same stuff same
[1:00:11] milk do you ever notice like if you go
[1:00:14] get a gallon of milk every gulp's going
[1:00:17] to taste like
[1:00:19] milk The Taste never changes you can
[1:00:22] actually get sick of it well if you
[1:00:23] drink it like constantly but if one once
[1:00:26] you go from milk to meat you can cook
[1:00:28] that meat all kinds of ways then you get
[1:00:31] to other solid
[1:00:33] foods and that's what gives you more
[1:00:35] vitamins more nutrients more strength
[1:00:38] and you taste things that you would
[1:00:39] never tasted if you would just stayed on
[1:00:41] if you would have stayed on
[1:00:46] milk he said but God hath revealed to
[1:00:48] him Us by his spirit for the spirit
[1:00:50] searches all things yay the Deep things
[1:00:52] of God this is this is beautiful
[1:00:56] if you have the Holy Ghost he's going to
[1:00:58] show you the deeper things saints of God
[1:01:01] I just taught a study down Junction City
[1:01:03] and they loved it because what it was a
[1:01:05] deeper thing they said for Simon I
[1:01:07] needed to hear that and I showed him
[1:01:09] Simplicity but it was deep it was simple
[1:01:13] as far as it was hidden he was hidden in
[1:01:15] the word of
[1:01:17] God he says for what man knoweth the the
[1:01:20] things of man he's to save the spirit of
[1:01:22] man which is in them absolutely we and
[1:01:24] we know what we're thinking you know we
[1:01:26] can we can uh uh converse with one
[1:01:28] another and and I can tell you what
[1:01:30] brother Austin's thinking I can tell you
[1:01:31] what brother sister so and so is
[1:01:32] thinking because we what those things of
[1:01:36] man he says save the spirit of man he
[1:01:38] says even so the things God know things
[1:01:40] of God knoweth no man but the spirit of
[1:01:42] God but don't you want to know what
[1:01:44] God's thinking don't you want to know
[1:01:46] his plan for you tomorrow for this next
[1:01:49] year he says now he says now we have
[1:01:52] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:01:54] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:01:56] know the things which are freely given
[1:01:57] to us of God which things we also we
[1:02:01] speak not in Words which man's Wisdom
[1:02:03] teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches
[1:02:06] comparing spiritual things with
[1:02:11] spiritual so at
[1:02:14] that that house Bible study I taught on
[1:02:16] last
[1:02:17] Friday we're talking about uh staying
[1:02:21] with the word I had I had to something
[1:02:24] something simple the absolute what's
[1:02:25] absolute the Bible the Bible and I
[1:02:27] started just working with do not add or
[1:02:29] take
[1:02:30] away because when someone adds to it
[1:02:33] they're using their own wisdom their own
[1:02:35] reasoning but if they take away from it
[1:02:37] they're also using their own wisdom
[1:02:38] their own
[1:02:39] thinking see so when they get into that
[1:02:42] they you can suffer greatly for those
[1:02:45] things they said brother Simon where's
[1:02:47] that okay adding and taking away where's
[1:02:49] that in the word of
[1:02:51] God and as she said that the the Lord
[1:02:54] brought Joe joab to my mind joab was a
[1:02:58] king I was was the head captain of the
[1:03:01] army of under David but if you look in
[1:03:04] the scripture how many times did joab
[1:03:06] disobey the king's
[1:03:08] word the king said do not K kill Absalon
[1:03:11] do not slay him don't put your hands on
[1:03:14] him I want him back here as my son as Su
[1:03:17] that word went out of the king's mouth
[1:03:19] that was the word of the king who was a
[1:03:21] type of Christ that word went out and
[1:03:23] what joab do first chance Jo saw him
[1:03:26] hanging the tree with his hair he put
[1:03:27] him through with a
[1:03:29] spear he disobeyed the word of
[1:03:35] God joab always trying to manipulate
[1:03:38] David always trying to do this or trying
[1:03:41] to do this or to direct him here this
[1:03:43] that and what it do it cost him at the
[1:03:45] end joab was cursed at the
[1:03:49] end because he did not obey David which
[1:03:53] was a type of Christ who had the word of
[1:03:55] God
[1:03:57] amen see he says but the natural man
[1:04:00] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:04:02] of God for they are foolishness unto him
[1:04:05] neither can he know them because they
[1:04:06] are spiritually discerned
[1:04:08] amen now let's stand here in
[1:04:11] closing saints of God artificial
[1:04:13] intelligence we are
[1:04:16] limited we wouldn't it be
[1:04:18] nice to have the mind of
[1:04:21] Christ all the time to know to hear the
[1:04:25] word of God to to hear to hear the voice
[1:04:27] of God constantly in our lives but we've
[1:04:29] got to set ourselves
[1:04:32] aside let me just say it like
[1:04:36] this we're promised the
[1:04:39] Rapture there is a body change
[1:04:42] coming there is going to be a people who
[1:04:45] escape death they will not see death
[1:04:49] they will not be
[1:04:50] Mars how many want that how many want
[1:04:52] that promise amen yeah we want that
[1:04:55] we're looking forward to because why it
[1:04:57] came to us did not the Bible say what
[1:04:59] Jesus say in John 10 he says the word of
[1:05:01] God always did not the word word of God
[1:05:03] come to
[1:05:04] Gods little
[1:05:06] G and if that was a promise a prophecy
[1:05:09] for us in this day that's the prophecy
[1:05:12] St St Paul said he said he said when he
[1:05:14] says uh he say uh corruption will put on
[1:05:17] incorruption and Mortal put on
[1:05:19] immortality that when that P that saying
[1:05:21] will become brought to
[1:05:23] pass that's we're waiting on on that
[1:05:27] prophecy is there anyone
[1:05:30] here that can change your body right now
[1:05:33] who has faith for right now because if
[1:05:35] you did I'm
[1:05:38] changed guess what I got a new body I
[1:05:40] can sing now
[1:05:42] whoop right hey I got a new body I'm s
[1:05:45] foot tall
[1:05:48] he I'm hoping I have hope
[1:05:52] now but if there's a revelation coming
[1:05:55] and it has to do with this Rapture what
[1:05:58] do we what are we going to do what do we
[1:05:59] have to do because we are artificial
[1:06:02] here we only know this realm now we have
[1:06:04] a greater understanding we need a
[1:06:06] greater Revelation but this last
[1:06:09] Revelation here this because remember
[1:06:11] that scripture has to be fulfilled and
[1:06:12] with the scripture comes a revelation of
[1:06:14] it you're going to know how to there's
[1:06:17] going to be something strike you that's
[1:06:18] going to change you but you've got to
[1:06:20] believe it now let me let me end here
[1:06:22] right
[1:06:22] here you will recall that I mentioned at
[1:06:25] the beginning of this message that the
[1:06:27] this book we are studying is the actual
[1:06:29] revelation of
[1:06:30] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[1:06:34] in the future ages then I mention that
[1:06:36] it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:06:38] Revelation or we will fail to get it we
[1:06:41] are leaning on the spirit of God not on
[1:06:45] a man's teaching not a man's preaching
[1:06:47] but it's going to take a revelation of
[1:06:49] the father of the Holy Ghost to bring
[1:06:52] this to
[1:06:54] us when you're out tomorrow when you're
[1:06:56] out tonight home wherever Lord just keep
[1:06:59] keep it in your mind Lord send me this
[1:07:02] Revelation keep keep thinking and
[1:07:04] meditating on this Rapture Lord I don't
[1:07:06] know how you're going to do it but I
[1:07:07] believe on that one I'm waiting show me
[1:07:10] the word give me this thing if it's
[1:07:12] Unwritten give it to me Unwritten so I
[1:07:14] can find it in the word if it's written
[1:07:15] I know it'll be right here and then
[1:07:17] raise Lord God raise my faith for
[1:07:21] this then I've mentioned that it takes
[1:07:23] the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or
[1:07:25] fail to get it bringing these two
[1:07:27] thoughts together you will see that it
[1:07:28] won't take just ordinary study and
[1:07:30] thinking to make this book real it is
[1:07:33] going to take the operation of the Holy
[1:07:37] Ghost by the time this Rapture takes
[1:07:39] place this is going to be the this book
[1:07:43] in your eyes is going to be
[1:07:48] magnified it's going to you're going to
[1:07:50] you're going to cover this Bible like
[1:07:52] you've never covered it before
[1:07:56] the old Saints 5 six 7 800 even now that
[1:07:59] died for this word they they went to
[1:08:02] death with their Bible you're not taking
[1:08:04] this and they took they took their
[1:08:07] martyrdom with their
[1:08:09] word that word is
[1:08:13] precious that means this book cannot
[1:08:16] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:08:18] special class of people everyone in the
[1:08:20] world that's Christians read this this
[1:08:22] morning and they're all striving for the
[1:08:25] same thing but Jesus said few there be
[1:08:26] that find it everyone's prophet sints of
[1:08:30] God from from the Lutheran to whoever
[1:08:33] believe in the Rapture in a form of
[1:08:36] it but the revelations only come into
[1:08:39] one one
[1:08:42] group that means this book can't be
[1:08:44] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:08:46] of people are you that special class
[1:08:51] absolutely he sent us a word he sent us
[1:08:53] a revelation but there's there's more
[1:08:56] coming it will take one with prophetic
[1:09:01] insight as we were sent a prophet you're
[1:09:04] going to have to get prophetic
[1:09:06] yourself you're going to have to be able
[1:09:08] to see in the spiritual you're going to
[1:09:10] have get it into the
[1:09:13] spiritual it will require the ability to
[1:09:16] hear from
[1:09:18] God it will require Supernatural
[1:09:21] instruction who wants the ability to
[1:09:23] hear God like that who wants
[1:09:25] Supernatural in instruction I do
[1:09:28] amen not just a student comparing verse
[1:09:31] with verse though that is
[1:09:33] good but a mystery didn't that Paul or
[1:09:37] Peter say he says behold I show you a
[1:09:39] mystery we shall not all die but we
[1:09:42] shall be
[1:09:44] changed he says but a mystery requires
[1:09:47] the teaching of the spirit or it never
[1:09:49] becomes
[1:09:51] clear how we need to hear from God and
[1:09:53] lay ourselves open become yielded to the
[1:09:56] spirit to hear and to
[1:09:59] know
[1:10:02] amen now you've got your marching orders
[1:10:06] what are you going to do tonight we're
[1:10:07] going to go down and seek the
[1:10:09] Lord when you get home pray read the
[1:10:13] Bible read the Bible pray and ask God to
[1:10:16] open this up brother side what if it
[1:10:18] remember it's going to but that
[1:10:20] Revelation is going to become at the
[1:10:21] right time as
[1:10:23] well but just keep what preparing
[1:10:26] yourself for it be welcome remember keep
[1:10:29] this heart clean because remember
[1:10:31] Revelation the reason you going miss a
[1:10:32] revelation because your heart is hard
[1:10:35] your heart's not right so keep your
[1:10:37] heart right and this revelation will
[1:10:39] strike at the right time all Hearts

[1:10:51] delivers and SS of God I believe these
[1:10:53] prayers are adding up and they filled up
[1:10:55] what into the vessel of God they're
[1:10:57] going to be poured out one day and
[1:10:58] they're all going to be
[1:10:59] answered there's there's there's
[1:11:01] something that being answered right now

[1:11:24] much you know what I was listening to on
[1:11:26] the way here was I was already planning
[1:11:28] on ministering on on artificial
[1:11:30] intelligence or you know human wisdom or
[1:11:32] however you want to say it I started
[1:11:34] listening to uh wisdom versus Faith
[1:11:42] 1962 and during
[1:11:44] that I don't know if that was one of the
[1:11:46] first or last or however but he in that
[1:11:48] beginning of the sermon he talks about
[1:11:50] how God gave him the vision about
[1:11:52] storing up vegetables and fruits that
[1:11:56] Storehouse he said he say he said
[1:11:58] there's coming a time where you're going
[1:11:59] to need
[1:12:00] this and it was right in that sermon
[1:12:03] Faith or wisdom versus Faith you're
[1:12:05] going to need Faith these Revelations
[1:12:08] here have to become so real to us that
[1:12:11] when we come up these circumstances when
[1:12:13] these tough times come we're going to
[1:12:15] have faith for
[1:12:16] it it's not going to look
[1:12:18] impossible when those children of Israel
[1:12:20] got there when Moses was leading them
[1:12:22] they come up to that the the Red Sea it
[1:12:24] looked impossible but saints of God it's
[1:12:26] not going to look and pour out possible
[1:12:27] to us all we're going to say is Lord I
[1:12:29] don't know how you're going to do it but
