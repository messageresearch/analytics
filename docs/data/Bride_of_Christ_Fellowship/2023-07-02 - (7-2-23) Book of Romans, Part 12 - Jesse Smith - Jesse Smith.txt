========================================

Grace Romans 5 verse 3 I'd like to continue on this series also I'm just going to tie it a different thought in at the end to try to bring a little something maybe a fresh scripture by God's grace and that I was inspired on yesterday Romans 5 verse 3. we'll read three down through nine Romans 5 verse 3. I'll read three down to eight and then we can all read nine together Romans 5 verse 3. we've been dealing on this a couple services in a robe I'll probably move on from this today verse 3 says and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience or christ-like character approved character and character produces hope and hope maketh not ashamed or does not disappoint because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us verse 6. for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet per adventure for a good man someone even Dare To Die but God commandeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us verse 9 let's read that together on three one two three much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make anointing to God today no doubt I have needs on my heart I'd like to see the Lord Minister too and I know you do too so let's pray father God again we come into your presence Lord It's All About You Jesus Lord God we've sang these songs and we've loved them Lord God we worshiped you we thank you for this wonderful atmosphere of faith and worship that we feel today Lord God we have needs but at the same time Lord we're joyful because we know the one who can meet needs is here as well Lord God you never failed you're never late you're right on time Lord God hallelujah all great things all good things come from thee Lord God and may you pour out great blessings and and words of strength and Grace to us today Lord God may your spirit move right here among us today Lord God we know you promised wherever two or three are there you are in the midst so Lord we know you're in our midst today God may we be mindful of your presence today your power your love your strength oh God hallelujah may you speak to us today by Your Word Lord and just continue to guide us Lord into the word of God into your truth and may we be strengthened and edified today made stronger today and we ask all these blessings in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God so uh Lydia had said that uh Simon spoke on how God is jealous God so wish I could have heard that message but actually I think he preached it at Living Waters so I guess I could go online and get a different version of it right because each time someone preaches a same message you know you get a different version of it I trust it was a blessing to everybody and thank you for everybody who helped out you know while we were out by God's grace so we want to look at this continue on Romans here I have a few slides here we'll show here by the grace of the Lord I'll just kind of tell you a little bit more about our trip you know we went to Pennsylvania had a great time in the Lord and you know that Pastor Paul he's actually into movies he does movies uh he works with like Productions and documentaries and so he knows the the people the leaders of Sight and Sound and he said years ago he told me he said you keep this family friendly he said you keep this um you know don't let any smut in it don't let any sin come in it and he said God will bless you and God's really blessed them so it was really interesting and he said they're putting on a movie uh January 1st 2025 and I told him you know let me know and they're going to do the history of the anabaptist so that's the that's the the original Saints during the Reformation who now turned into the Amish so in other words basically the Amish and Mennonites there uh their founding fathers you know were the anabaptists and they gave their lives many of them were martyrs for Jesus Christ uh you know during the time of the Reformation period right around the time of you know Martin Luther and everything and so they're making a documentary on it and uh they're going to have they said they're going to spend I think the budget is a couple million dollars they're going to spend on this new movie and so just really interesting and now they also came out of Joseph Coleman's movement which brother Branham ordained Joseph Coleman but you know Joseph Coleman his later years really got off the word of God and then they brought a lot of disgrace upon the message I mentioned that movement but anyways 12 years ago they realized wow this movement is worshiping Joseph Coleman we got to get out of this movement and so they've had that church there for 12 years like I said it's like a twin Church to us I didn't know we had a twin but we got a twin over there in Pennsylvania they're just I mean it's just like archers he and I went and uh I said okay this is just like hole when he said that's right they were a couple people were standing up amening and I preached on the message the red heifer that I preached here and I preach it at many places God's really blessed that message and um just as kind of like an update you know I just thought I'd share with you the pastor got up afterwards and he said myself and the other minister have been preaching on this for two months he said and he said this is exactly what we needed to hear he said we've been working on fellowship and how there's Fellowship in the holiest of holies and that's what God has called us to called us to is fellowship and he said you just preached and the pastor kept turning around while I was preaching looking at the other people like I thought well it must be must be preaching the right thing you know but we had two people come up for prayer one was for healing and we'll just trust that God will heal that individual the other one was a young young lady rededicating her life to the Lord it was just a beautiful prayer you know she said she got cold on God and uh she confessed her sins and it was just really sweet she was weeping and crying and you know for me I like that visual so she had not you know pulled out of her nose it was all just falling all the way are you I might not seem something like to you but that really blessed me because many times I prayed that same thing happened to me it's gross but it happens you know just when you're under the presence of God like that I thought that was really sincere she was all smiles afterwards was so thankful and everybody was so happy and uh you know we're going back there you know in April for uh the Daniel show on my Spring Break so I said well I'll be back in April if you want me to preach there so they said they would like me to preach there again in April so we're going back there but let's remember keep remembering them in prayer their sweet little church there and then you know Saturday night or so sorry Friday night I went down there to The Junction City Saints they're all doing really well and we had two visitors from uh brother Jeff Snodgrass Church in Logan and I preached I just felt led to preach on the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul and I just printed off you know a bunch of quotes from other brand I'm in a bunch of scriptures and numerous people were crying at the end nobody came up for prayer but afterwards four people told me that was exactly what they needed to hear and they said so many things answered so many questions that they had and it was a great I was just preaching the brothers basement there you know it was really really wonderful time in the Lord so it's been just a great time to go minister to other Saints and strengthen the body of Christ praise God I don't think I've ever been this busy before in my life you know I'm on vacation might have been super busy and then brother Brooks wants me to come out to Iowa next or this month so I may go when brother Ben norad's here because I already have a preacher here so when benarod comes I think I might go to Iowa to talk to my wife and the family about that but just so you know Ben Naruto be here on the 16th we have some birthdays coming up cases on the 18th for the Jose are you right after Acacia your birthday 19. amen and then we got Nature's on the 21st amen okay okay what do you say bro what'd you say bro [Laughter] so many times around right so three birthdays in July so praise God in a wedding in August so we got a lot of a lot to look forward to these next few months half the Year is already gone you know so we know it's been invested in the great the best things the word of God so Hallelujah so let's look at the Lord here you know we we're still on this second section today we'll start moving over into the third section here crucifixion with Christ and the Believers walk in the Holy Spirit so we've seen how the whole world is guilty before God but we're justified by faith as the solution for Guilt just like Abraham was justified by faith he was called out out of a life of idolatry he was he was carving Idols making idols and and his dad was somehow connected to the Tower of Babel it was all idolatry and yet God in his voice one voice the voice of God called him out and separated him praise God that's what God's done for us he separated us from our life of idolatry praise God and he saved us by his grace as well not of any merits of our own but just because we believed his word we believed in the cross of Jesus Christ he's imputed his righteousness to us and now he's going to finish what he started praise God just as God finished it with Abraham he's going to finish it with our lives so these are you know newer scriptures I guess we'd say so verse 6 for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly I just like uh to say this you know Christ died when we were completely weakened you know in every believer uh you know would say the same you know before we knew Christ we were totally weak you know we had no strength to live a good life we had no strength to uh to do any Miracles we had no strength to to overcome anything right we were slaves to sin or if and if not then we were slaves to religion like the Jews they were slaves so legalism and and trying to work their way to Salvation but the Bible says that Christ died for us in the due time and I think it was beautiful you know God waited four thousand years uh in order to let the let all mankind know that that no man could earn salvation no man no woman could earn salvation God gave them four thousand years to try to to to realize that that salvation would never come by their efforts alone and think of all the animals that have been sacrificed my millions and billions maybe of animals that had died to try to show these people uh the The Plan of Salvation that blood always had to be shed it was going to take blood another in order for man to be right with God blood had to be shed and God showed them through four thousand years so much blood had to be shed you know there was so much of a sacrifice and it was showing that Jesus that so many sins would be put upon Christ not just the sins of the past but the sins of the whole world not just the sins of the Believers but the sins of the Sinners as well he was speaking that the cross proves his love Hallelujah and I just think it's so beautiful that you know at the right time right at the right moment you know God sent Jesus to die for sins and then we can look back we can look back two thousand years and say wow uh you know history knowledge had 2 000 years to enjoy the blessings of Christ amen hallelujah we know most people won't find it but we can see the history of the church and we can see how God's grace was on the history of the church for two thousand years Hallelujah in each trial the Believers were able to overcome because of what Christ did Hallelujah because they were assured think about that they were many of them were Martyrs many of them died because they were assured that God loved them and that that God expressed his love through the cross praise God even Peter one of the you know one of the original Martyrs there in the beginning even he was so assured of the love of the Cross he said crucify me upside down because I'm not worthy to be crucified like Jesus was crucified my just the uh the power of the cross at such an effect on the Believers it turned 11 men that ran from Jesus it turned them from uh from deserters to men that would all give their lives for Christ except for John who died uh the only one who died a normal life but all the other ten were were able just to give their lives as a sacrifice because of the power of the love of Jesus Amen I love what the Bible says that when he washed their feet I love what the Bible says about Jesus Jesus the Bible said when it came to his end of Earthly life the Bible said he loved them to the end praise God and he made himself a servant and he wash their feet praise God and he loved them to the end he broke bread he had communion with them he ate with them and he promised them I'll eat again with you I'll drink again with you but it'll be in the future Kingdom praise God hallelujah but first i'm going to prove my love to you by Dying For You on the cross amen what uh what a expression of love we have in Christ Jesus verse 7 says for scarcely for a righteous man will one die so in other words you rarely find someone that will die for another it's very rare yet per adventure for a good man some would even Dare To Die so it's so rare to find someone that would give their life for another so this is why we should honor our veterans this is why you know we have July 4th that's why you know we'll we'll you you and I will probably go somewhere we'll watch some fireworks be shot off and we'll say wow that's beautiful wow that's amazing the whole point of that is to remember men that gave their lives men and women right men and women who gave their lives mostly men though at that time you know men and women that gave their lives it's to remember that you know they'll spend thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars on fireworks to help us remember that that men would leave their families young men many times would leave their families and know they're going off to die right scarcely scarcely the the right anyone would die for a righteous person but think of the lives you know there were many lives that they would they would sacrifice knowing they're going to die and yet they would walk right into death why so it would we would have hope for the future praise God and look look where we live today look at the blessings we have today praise God because there were some that chose to die that we could have freedoms praise God so let's enjoy the freedom of the Lord amen amen hallelujah and I put that question on there who would you die for if you had a chance who would you die for because the Bible said it's very scarce very rare to find someone that would die for another and yet Jesus died for many who would never love him and I love the of course the scripture from Hebrews 12 where the Bible said for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross and search that's a great lesson we can learn as we go through trials you know as Jesus went through his his death he had to keep his mind on something positive right that's what you've got to do when you go through difficult times you got to keep your mind on something positive and so the Bible tells us plainly Jesus died for the joy that was set before him amen the joy of knowing that because I'm going to die I'm going to bring millions of souls out of the heart of the earth up to heaven praise God and then I'm going to bring millions and many more I'm going to bring them up to heaven praise God I'm going to bring them uh uh I'm gonna I'm Gonna Save their souls and give them a future I'm going to give them Robes of light praise God I'm going to give them forgiveness of sins Hallelujah the church says we go through our difficult trials let's remember there's there's positive things that we must look forward to we might we must remember all these trials are working together for our good praise God Hallelujah remember for the joy that was set before Christ let's remember the joy that set before us praise God so the Bible says it's very rare for a righteous man to die but Jesus died while we were yet without without strength and let me say it like this as well I think I mentioned this last week you know in Hebrews 11 the Bible says many died that did not receive the promise I'm going to just read that so I don't mess it up in other words you know and I think it most applies to us where we would believe for our loved ones to be saved and uh you know and they might not get saved maybe during our lifetime if the Lord tarries if we don't live to see the Rapture maybe we wouldn't see our loved ones maybe be saved while we're alive but yet we should have hope even we should we should go to the Grave if God chooses us to go to the Grave we should go with hope knowing that God can save praise God Hallelujah verse 39 of Hebrews 11 39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise of course the promise uh was the future home right was the what was a because the Bible said Abraham was seeking a city whose Builder and maker was God Amen Abraham knew there's a New Jerusalem there's a perfect City God's God city is coming somewhere praise God brother bear said it was right above him amen hallelujah and Jesus went to prepare that City Hallelujah but see these all died and they didn't have this Promise This Promise of a new city a New Jerusalem a new body verse 40 God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so we have a better Covenant with better promises amen we have better benefits we live a better spiritual life because of the Cross praise God but also there will become a perfect City there come a new city a new home a future home praise God a beautiful land amen hallelujah there's coming a married land amen and that's where Abraham was seeking that's where Abraham's seed is seeking we're all seeking that Heavenly City praise God Hallelujah so this you know we take this uh we we take this encouragement here that that all these Old Testament Saints died not receiving the promise so if the Lord should allow us to die we should die still believing the promise of God still believing that all things are possible for God hallelujah in other words this caused us to never lose our hope as we read earlier in the chapter praise God can do all things praise God now verse 8 but God commended that means to prove he proves his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us hallelujah so he proved his Love To Us by sending Jesus to the Cross to die for us while we were yet sinners and and church one way we can do that we can pray for people before they're Christians we can we can treat them good before they get saved we can love them before they're lovable right like a lot of our loved ones maybe aren't very loving they're not easy to be around and I guess we get to experience that pretty soon right Glory stop sorry I keep licking my fingers uh but that don't encourage us that Jesus died for us before we we loved him before we knew him but before we could appreciate him before we'd worship he died for us before we would return the love for him so that encourages us to love the unlovable it encourages us to be like Jesus Christ praise God hallelujah this is the love of God and I read this uh on Wednesday I'm sorry on Friday to The Junction City Saints Old Testament sacrifices could never take away sins and remember that's how it was you know for Abraham and Moses and Joseph all the Old Testament Saints their sins were never truly forgiven I'm going to read that just because I'm already there in Hebrews 11. so let me go to Hebrews 10 10. by the which will we are Sanctified that means purified Glory through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all let me know you're pure today see in our minds we don't feel like we're pure but in God's eyes you are pure because the sacrifice died for you God in God's mind he's always looking at the sacrifice he's only your state is already forgiven because your sacrifice has already been sacrificed amen you're already pure that's what the Bible says through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all praise God once for all amen once for all time Hallelujah verse 11 and every priest and a daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins now you know later some somewhere in this chapter I didn't have a chance to look it up but the Bible says they would they would leave off their animal sacrifices and they'd still feel like a sinner but the Bible says we can be different how many know what that feeling is like you walk into church you come to church discouraged but you walk out feeling Victorious amen or you're a sinner but then you get baptized and you repent and now you feel like a saint praise God the things of God have become alive to you the things of God are real amen hallelujah the word of God is yes and amen hallelujah and you know your sins are taken away praise God I felt that way on Wednesday night when Malachi was there after preaching that I was just weeping and crying seeing the people rejoice and I just thought I feel like I feel like a new Christian Hallelujah I know I'm forgiven amen hallelujah I know Christ has forgiven me praise God I know Jesus loves me I know he's purified me I know he's for me I know he died for me he already proved his love for me praise God and I want to I want to prove my love to him now Hallelujah so see it can never take away sins but Jesus died before we could appreciate his love and now church we spend the rest of our lives showing him how much we appreciate his love that's what we do Hallelujah now verse 9. I want to get into some of these uh important phrases in here much more than being now justified by his blood see so much more now because we're in the New Testament much more now being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from the Wrath through him so much more we have much more justification now in the New Testament right not not it's not saved by animal blood not covered by animal blood but the sin our sins are totally washed away sins are totally abolished through the blood of Jesus Christ much more and church now we're Justified fine this reminded me of now we're the sons of God in First John 3 verse 2. now we're God's children think about that right now you're a son or daughter of God you're a child of God God is your father amen that means he's going to bless you that means he's going to help you out praise God he's watching over you when did he not watch over you he's watching over you your whole life praise God he hovered over your over your body while he was forming you in your mother's womb praise God he was there at the beginning he's he's there now he'll forever be with you praise God you've oh like the Bible says you always were a Son of God you always were a daughter of God that's your identity praise God I'm not a I'm not an ohioan I'm I'm from Heaven praise God I hope I don't live in Ohio in the Millennium praise God I hope I live somewhere else praise God Amen I'm not in Ohio and I'm not just an American I'm a Child of God hallelujah I'm a Christian I'm a child of the king and right now I already am praise God so are you right now how through the blood amen through the sacrifice through the cross I'm Justified I'm declared righteous as I wish to be through his blood and I will not come into God's Wrath amen I won't live through the the trumpets I won't live through the woes praise God I won't live through the vows praise God I'm spared that God does not have wrath for me I have peace with God Amen through our Lord Jesus Christ because now I'm much more Justified now the Bible says and I'm now the child of God through the blood and now I'm totally passed from Death unto life amen oh Satan says you're oh you're you're going to be separated from God and God doesn't love you and and your your future is death and you can take John 5 24 and say Satan you're a liar I've already passed from Death unto life amen it's in the past amen it's not my future it's in the past I'm not going towards death I have eternal life praise God like brother said you take that scripture on Abraham stagger night he said you can stick down the devil's face 365 days out of the year so we should do that today right right devil I can I can tell the devil that I'm going to John 5 24. I'm going to tell the devil that right now you can join me if you want to turn there if not you can just say Amen John 5 24. Satan verily verily Jesus told us he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life so Satan I believe in Jesus Christ Satan I've already got everlasting life Satan I shall not cut him into condemnation I've already passed from Death unto life there's that right in your face devil or maybe he's down there right in your face devil that's what the Bible says I believe it God said it that settles it praise God 's word cannot lie sometimes church I realize this just in my own life and I'm sure in your life too we just life gets so busy and so distracted like that's what the Junction City saints were telling me they're like wow it's been a busy week this Summer's been the busiest summer of my life I said you just said exactly what I'm going through it's been the busiest summer of my life it feels like and and they said uh we're glad we made the opportunity to be in the house of God you know we were tempted to kind of uh cancel the service but we rescheduled it to Friday night and there said they said we're really glad we did that I said it's the best thing you've done Amen to gather with God's people to worship God to feel his presence to feel his love to sit in Heavenly places what more could you what praise God it restores our faith restores our vision restores our joy Hallelujah in other words if if Farmers now think about that they're Farmers if Farmers feel more busy than ever before and yet we're not farmers right you would think oh farmers are real that's a real easy life not that it's not actually an easy life it's super busy life all right so we're super hard labor life a lot of hard work a lot of sweat a lot of long hours talk about 12-hour shifts they do that all the time but see if they're feeling busy we're we're feeling busy we're all feeling busy so we got to cut out more time to be in God's presence Hallelujah we've got to make time to be refreshed how many believe that let's make time to be refreshed make time to Worship the Lord like we're doing now praise the Lord amen because now we're Justified and much more much more praise God in the New Testament are we Justified much more are we Justified now praise God and much more will be saved from the Wrath through Christ now church we don't have to worry about am I good enough to escape the tribulation it's not based upon your works you're not saved through your Works you're saved through him am I good enough to to to overcome the mark of the beast it's not abased upon you it's based upon Christ amen you escape the wrath through him praise God Amen amen that's how I'm escaping it you just got a picture you know if the tribulation is all before us if the tribulation is before us you know we got to look at the reason I'm getting out is because I can I have an exit I can exit I use this door all the time but I can actually I have a I can exit the tribulation through Christ Christ is the door and all you got to do is walk through the door it's through Christ I'll be saved it's through Christ I'll have mercy it's through Christ I'll be purified amen amen it's all through Christ and this is remember this is how Paul is trying to get Gentiles and Jews to all be United trust in Christ trust in Christ much more we're now justified by the blood we're now Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah I wanna I love I read this this morning I thought it was so beautiful from Albert Barnes the late preacher much more than being now justified by his blood we should be saved from wrath through him he says it is much more reasonable to expect it in other words we should we should expect God's mercy even more in the New Testament think about the mercy God had in the Old Testament a Moses a murderer you know he didn't circumcise his children you know look he smote the rock all these things Moses did and yet he had Grace think of Samson that's think of Samson my goodness mistake after mistake after mistake after mistake you know blatant Disobedience to God's word yet God had God still spoke to him God had mercy on him and God helped him overcome and God helped them accomplish his purpose in the very last Act of his life amen Church God's Gonna help you accomplish your purpose amen you can't miss it because God's fighting for you praise God you can't miss it yet God had mercy on Samson amen amen God will have mercy on you but much more praise God that's what the Bible says much more in the New Testament praise God it's more reasonable to expect it if when we were enemies now think when you were an enemy Jesus overcame all that was in the way of your salvation think about that your denomination for me the denominations were in my way to be saved right all my Temptations all my selfishness All My Pride think of all the obstacles think of it like all the all the mountains that were in the way of salvation but Jesus overcame all that praise God to save me he said how much more have we reasoned to expect that he will afford us protection now that we're his friends amen if he loved us while we were enemies and we were fighting against him and he still showed his love to us how much more will he give us favor now that we're fighting for him praise God now that we're the friends of God we're the sons of God how much more can we expect his grace and his favor and His blessings now that we're the family of God Amen amen this is amazing much more we should expect it Hallelujah hallelujah praise God I see that church don't you see that you know thinking about Samson don't you see that in your life Samson made all these mistakes but don't you see God keeping you from mistakes don't you see that You know despite our Temptations and our trials it seems like God steps in before we make an awful mistake before we do something really bad it's like God steps in and said no child I'm protecting you from this don't go there God watches over us so well so well I'll just tell this testimony you know we're at that house there you know about Genevieve uh we just got done seeing Moses the night before and the girls want to jump in the hot tub you know I got their modest swim wear on you know and everything and I just felt compelled to stand right there by the by the hot tub I don't know why you know normally I might have just jumped on my computer and said okay I'm watching you I'm a study I just felt compelled I was holding you know I was holding uh Zion and then Genevieve you know was on the corner and Genevieve you know kind of she either slipped off or stepped off into the deep and she started sinking and all the other girls were looking away they were playing which is okay but I was right there I had Zion so I it was a far reach so all I could grab was Genevieve's ponytail and I pulled her up and I said Haven grab her and Haven turns around like lightning shoes she lifted Jenny right up by the water amen a church God guided that that was God's kindness to us that's God's kindness and it reminded me of when God saved me from drowning I was a young boy I talked to my cousin about it he said he said I just looked down he said I feel like I got to help out Jesse and he pulled me up out of the water I was drowning I know I was drowning I was dead I was gone but God reached his hand down for me just one more expression of how much more God's love will favor us how much more God will he's watching us praise God he's just he's so he's so near to us Hallelujah so I just like this because he says we should expect more protection we should expect great things we should expect God's favor for our future praise God because we follow Christ and we're his friends we're no longer his enemies we're his friends hallelujah praise God Amen I want to go now I want to just I just wanted to show in these two verses twice Paul says it so Christ is so much more than what we think he is praise God we have so much more blessings than what we actually realize Glory praise God we I mean we appreciate the Old Testament Saints and my testimony will never scratch this surface to their testimonies but we have access to Greater Mercy we have access to Greater favor and protection because it's a better Covenant praise God we can walk away forgiven of sins we can walk away feeling redeemed praise God we can walk away with the joy of the Lord amen praise God we can walk away knowing God protecting us from our worst failures praise God the scar he kept us from scars in our lives that might have stained our lives but because of the blood of Christ because we're under a better Covenant we can walk in the victory of Christ Hallelujah so much more we're Justified much more we're saved much more for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled or returned to favor we shall be saved by his life Much More Much More shall we be saved Hallelujah if the cross reconciled us how much more will we be saved by his life in our lives amen Glory Hallelujah verse 11. and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we've now received the atonement again I want to emphasize that now much more and now we have more blessings than we realize and we got it right now I got it today praise God Amen I got it right now I'm not hoping for it I already got it praise God what Satan does is distract us from realizing what we got praise God amen hallelujah we got the whole armor of God we got the sword of the spirit we have the word of God we have the revelation of the word of God we have the the message of the hour we have all these blessings Satan's trying to distract us let's get our eyes focused on what we have right now praise God I've got it now Hallelujah so we have much more reason to believe this makes us joyful if we don't have joy let's pray for it like David did restore the joy of my salvation and I found that too Church the only time we don't I'm lacking Joys when I'm battling sin right or I haven't really confessed my sin or really overcome the sin that's the only time I'm lacking Joy most of the time I got a lot of Joy though right a lot of time I have joy God wants us all to have joy so the way to have Joys confess our sins praise God say God restore my walk Lord restore my confidence restore the sweetness of Fellowship uh restore my time with you uh bring it back I want to have joy praise God we now have the atonement as well we have now received the atonement I think I got the definition of the atonement what have we received now we've received the atonement we've received an exchange in other words we've traded all of our sins for Jesus's righteousness we've now received it so don't let the devil try to tell you all these sins you got to pay for these sins you don't have to you've already made the exchange the devil said remember what you did last time remember what you did last week remember what you did last year devil I've already exchanged him I got the atonement now amen I've got God's favor now the devil says God don't favor you God don't care you can say the Bible says I've got God's favor now praise God it's not coming it's already here amen praise God Amen it's already here I see it I know it I feel it it's the word of God it cannot lie it's true praise God I've already got the atonement praise God what do you have Rogers what do you have saints I have the restoration of God's favor because I've repented and put my trust in this in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ I've already done the exchange right the Bible says we already have received the exchange I've already got his righteousness God already sees me as a forgiven child of God God already sees me in my glorified State amen that that's in the same book in Romans 8 the Bible said he that God's called he's already Justified and he that God's Justified he's already glorified he's already got a glorified body for us Saints amen we already got a perfect body we're already pure in his sight we are now the Sons and Daughters of God now praise God Hallelujah because I've made the exchange I'm Trading My Sorrows for the joy of the Lord amen well I got some I don't sing that really good but I really like that song Amen Hallelujah I'm trading my songs for the joy of the Lord I'm trading my depression I'm trading my sickness I'm trading my fears I want Christ's love I want Christ righteousness and I got it right now praise God I can train it praise God I can exchange for the love of Jesus Christ oh what a blessing we know we don't have to let me say like this we don't have to live our lives without this Exchange Hallelujah we can live our lives with Christ's love and Christ's righteousness and all the fruits of the spirit and all the attributes of a Christian we can live our lives with that but we daily understand that we have the exchange oh thank you God so now we cross over that was verse 11. now we crossed over into the next section here we'll look at a crucifixion with Christ and the Believers walk in the Holy Spirit oh it's a beautiful section man this is just glorious now verse 12 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin that's Adam and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned so one man's sin produced all this all sinners for until the law sin was in the world so until Moses but sin is not imputed where there is no law so before Moses wrote down all those laws the Believers might have been committing some of the sins but it wasn't imputed because it wasn't written down right nevertheless death Reign from Adam to Moses even when there was no law death still Reign because of Adam's sin even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who's the figure of him that was to come Hallelujah no I love this verse verse 15. but not as the offense so also is the free gift for through the offense of one many be dead so what Adam's one sin produced many deaths I love this Hallelujah much more there it is again much more so three times Paul is saying much more Christ has done so much more for us praise God we have more blessings more access more grace more purification more salvation more deliverance we have more of God's love Hallelujah much more the grace of God and the gift of Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many oh Hallelujah and then I preached on this I think last year or two years ago it's a free gift you didn't earn salvation you didn't earn eternal life you didn't earn the crown of Rewards or you didn't earn that it's a free gift praise God it's a free gift just by repenting and believing in Jesus Christ Hallelujah and I love how God works this out God says he lets one man's sin equal many deaths but then he does the opposite one man's obedience gives many the gift of eternal life the gift of Grace Hallelujah in other words God undo undoes what every man messes up God's the one who can turn things around amen Adam messing up so Jesus come around and I'll turn that around praise God isn't that just like Jesus will make a mistake but then Jesus will fix our mistake praise God hallelujah we'll do something wrong and Jesus will come around he'll make it right praise God we'll put ourselves in a bad situation Jesus will turn around he'll put us in a good situation praise God oh my that's what Jesus did with Adam's sin with Adam's failure he turned it around and of course God's God's Victory will be greater than man's sin man sin was awful produce all these deaths all these sins but how much more amen how much more will Jesus obedience produce eternal life amen oh my much more so I found this online I thought it was a pretty easy picture to understand some of these things it's just a contrast Christ is so much different from Adam Adam brought sin the world but Jesus gives the people victory over sin and I'm saying church we need to live our lives with victory over sin we don't have to say well someday you know someday when I get a new body then I won't have to battle this well that might be true in some little areas but we can still overcome lots of sins today praise God we can overcome and what Paul calls is Dominion we can overcome the Dominion of sin the slavery to sin that's what we're supposed to overcome we don't have to be slaves right we don't have to be slaves we want to be a slave to Jesus amen we want to be a prisoner of Christ the Bible says hallelujah we should have victory over sin in our lives now Hallelujah that's right now because of Adam many men die because of his sin but many live because of Jesus Grace Adam's sin results in many being condemned Jesus death results in many being justified Hallelujah Adam's Disobedience bring sin to many but Jesus obedience bring righteousness to many and Adam's sin Reigns in death but Jesus Grace Reigns to give us eternal life Hallelujah I love Paul's writings amen he's trying to show the contrast Adam did this but Christ did this think about that all the all the sins Adam all of our sins is really what Adam you know is this fault but because of Jesus because of what Jesus did all our Victory is Jesus righteousness praise God it's our benefit because what Jesus did praise God Jesus undoes he's the last Adam he undoes what the first Adam did oh it's beautiful a beautiful contrast there Hallelujah verse 16. and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation Adam but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification so again this idea of free gift the second time free gift is in here Jesus is the free gift to us all salvation is a free gift you know as I was dealing with those other churches you know the Pennsylvania and the uh The Junction City there was a couple people that were struggling like this they're seeking the Holy Ghost and then they told me they're even struggling like am I even saved does God even love me again they're seeking the Holy Ghost well see that that that's a natural condemnation Satan's gonna put on you right because Satan knows we don't like to be patient we don't like to wait for our gifts right that's why when you're little you might have snuck under the Christmas tree and ripped open the gifts to see what was under there I know I did I'll just confess it right now but it's hard to be patient for free gifts but as the word of God went forth it became very clear God loves us and and it becomes clear like and I just use the example of a natural birth like as much as a woman you know a pregnant woman wants to have that baby at a certain time it's going to come when the baby's ready to come unless you got a C-section right unless there's an emergency or something like that but you can wait and sometimes they come early before you're ready for them right sometimes you got to wait a little long afterwards but it's coming and that's what God wants to teach us the new birth is coming praise God amen hallelujah the new Earth is coming amen the Rapture is coming praise God the body changes come and praise God it's going to happen God wants us to be patient praise God and it's a free gift Hallelujah salvation is a free gift and the Bible even calls the baptism the Holy Ghost is a gift because what do you have to do you just have to keep walking to the promised land that's all Moses and the children of Israel all they had to do was keep walking in this in the right direction right amen right all they do is just keep walking church just keep walking towards the Holy Ghost just keep walking toward any promise of God all right see that just don't go in a circle like Israel did Israel just went around the Wilderness over and over again I'm just no notice Church they were circling their problems right they just circled it they just went around I just they never moved on from this issue or this problem in their life we got to move on from issues in our lives we got to move and and stop circling that stop spending your time going around this and spend your time moving forward in Christ Jesus amen spend your time thanking God and and blessing His holy name because it's through Christ you'll inherit every promise of God thank God Amen how many love the Lord today praise God that's my little reset there now let me finish this up by God's grace Hallelujah we got maybe a little a little bit more ways to go here I'm going to inject this just a fresh scripture in here I haven't preached on maybe in a while so through Christ one obedience all are Justified from their many offenses who accept the gift so just like Adam's one sin brought many offenses Jesus is one obedience brought many justifications so sin is a perversion right Adam is a perversion so the real thing has to be even greater than atoms glory amen the real thing think about all the sins in this world think about all the deaths that Adam caused you could put even there too right they both had to part in it think about all the deaths and sins well how much greater is Jesus obedience praise God right hallelujah how much greater Jesus obedience going to produce years and years and ages that will live it and church uh you know these sins will have an end death has an end but eternal life has no end praise God that's how great The Obedience of one was Hallelujah there's no end of blessings there's no end to eternal life it keeps rolling on over and over again and unending it's an infinite expression of God's love through Jesus Christ praise God all these sins will have an end they'll finally be swallowed up in life Hallelujah but our Joys will never end oh thank God that's why we join now in Christ Jesus Hallelujah thank God thank God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus it's a free gift and you just have to accept the gift just have to accept it Hallelujah verse 17. for by one man's offense Adam death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ so here's what we see one offense death Reigns and look it's still raining today because of Adam and Eve sin but Jesus won obedience life has now reigned for two thousand years and then it's going to rain for a thousand years without sin praise God praise God and then it's going to rain for unending ages and cycles of Eternity where there is no end of life eternal life reigning for all eternity praise God I don't have any other words for it praise God it's infinite it's Eternal unending praise God so see church we Reign through Jesus Philippians 4 13 says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and then Nehemiah 8 10 the joy of the Lord is my strength now whatever you're facing day think about that and say I can do all things through Christ I can face this trial through Christ I don't have to quit I don't have to compromise enough to give up I don't have to walk away I can do all things through Christ because he strengthens me can you do it yes can I do it yes I can do all things like I always use that one people say why I can't have any children because they're going to grow up in such a filthy world no you can you can do all things through Christ I can't have children you can you can do all things through Christ who strengthens us right all right like I've heard people say I can never go and make it right with that person they hurt me too much well yes you can you can do all things through Christ right I mean that's the word of God praise God like where's the word of God when you need it right there right there's the word of God that you need you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you and then the joy of the Lord is your strength so true in the moment if you get your Bibles handy and the moment we're gonna look at Nehemiah here in just a moment I want to move into this thought here I want to finish with this thought maybe I'll set a timer here 15 minutes we'll see kind of how it goes it may go longer it's we only have one service today so I want to read this quote from brother Brandon I'm a very familiar quote uh maybe for me I'm not sure how much you've read the church age book but brother man reads Revelation 1 verse six now remember in in Romans 5 we just said we reign in life through Christ and now he says uh John says and he hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen brother man says he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize that's why I'm preaching it again I need to emphasize this I need to make this stronger amen I need to make this more clear God made you a king God made you a priest I want to emphasize that today praise God he didn't make you a slave to sin he made you a king over sin praise God hallelujah he didn't make you someone with no power to intercede he made you a priest he didn't cut you off from the Throne of God he brought you invited you to the throne of God remember the priests in the Old Testament they had access to God you are someone that has access to God God's not avoiding your prayers God's inviting you to pray to him praise God we must emphasize this praise God because many times churches there's just no simple humble prayers that's where we find God answer them just in simple just taking a few moments out to pray to God and ask him to be gracious that's where we find him many times in the simple the simple uh the simple calling the simple priesthood of Prayer we find him in those moments where we just humble ourselves and stop and pray oh there's certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he he hath made us Jesus Jesus made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose that's why I love Esther Mordecai said don't you know you've been brought to the throne for such a time as this and church don't you know this is your time to be a king and priest it's your time right now now's the time for us to rule over sin now's the time for us to intercede for other people praise God it's for such a time as this God wants to use us now praise God now the work now how much more does God want to use us now praise God hmm that's what I'm finding you know as I preach those different places I'm getting these more open doors and imitations I'm seeing God wants to use me now but I got to be willing to lose some sleep that's what I've lost a lot of sleep driving extra miles and everything and being up late nights I don't like staying up late nights but God's asking me to serve him now it's for a purpose and the brother oh yeah I only want to share this to brother brother Irvin down there in Junction City he got up after that Holy Ghost sermon he just started crying he said God loves us so much to give us the truth like this he said we could be in denomination he said we were in denomination he said we could be deceived he said but look we have God's word and we have the revelation of this hour it makes grown men cry that's what the gospel does amen hallelujah that makes me cry it's a purpose I have a purpose in my life so do you praise God we're Kings spiritual Kings oh we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom praise God don't you know it's your purpose don't you know it's your purpose as a king to make your home a place where the Devils can't get in and I mean the Devils of doubt the Devils of Temptation the Devils of fear the Devils of lust and greed and anger you have to rule over your house and don't let those devils in because your king praise God you're a queen Hallelujah you're a priest unto God that's what you're the rule right now we're part of a spiritual Kingdom praise God and then he quotes that's what we just read right Romans 5 17 we shall reign in life by one and then Colossians 1 13. already preach on that who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son think about that the word translate is what they use about Philip Philip got translated from the eunuch baptized in the eunuch to another city well that's what's happened to us we've got translated out of our own life into a new life praise God Amen we're translated he's changed our location he's changed our surroundings praise God we're in a new place he moved us where he wants us to be praise God hmm were translated into the kingdom of his dear son he said right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil everybody say four things ready fourth thing you Reign Over four things the world sin the flesh and the devil so you can say it's the I have the word of I have the authority from Jesus Christ flesh I'll Reign Over You you can say sin I have the word of the Lord I'm reigning over you because I have dominion over you sometimes we just have to remind ourselves that we got to speak the name of Jesus and say Satan get behind me I Reign Over You Satan like I heard Brothers Ram said but the man said Satan's not afraid of me he said Satan hates me he said I don't have he said Satan's more powerful than me he said but I've got Authority I've got Authority because I represent Christ hallelujah we're ambassadors amen so that's why we can make Satan move not because we have power but we represent a kingdom oh I represent the Kingdom of Heaven I represent God's will in heaven being done on this Earth praise God so I've dominion over sin because he gave me authority over it I'm translated I'm in a new kingdom now I'm not in the Old Kingdom anymore I'm in a new kingdom Hallelujah showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself or it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus do you feel that praise God do you feel I'm in a Heavenly place right now my the thoughts of God are filling my mind I know there's Angels around us right now amen I know Heaven is open to my prayers amen now now I'm a son or daughter of God right now praise God these are these are realities God hears our prayers Hallelujah he proved that to us when Austin got healed in the service a couple weeks ago right there right there in the service God heal them in the migraines right there praise God why we're sitting in Heavenly places our focus is on the things of God our minds are on the Lord praise God we're here to have dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil praise God and made us priests yes priests and him offering the spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips like I love walking out here of an amen singing Hallelujah because we're we're all priests offering I love to see Hands raised I love to see eyes close and or Hearts bowed I love to see people praising God that's your calling that's what you were born to do that's why he saved you that's why he translated you to this church amen and the spiritual church of the body of Christ amen amen that's what you were born for to be a priest to God spend your life as a sweet offering to him Church your life is so much happier that you're a Christian so much happier God has spared us so many awful things by saving our souls amen amen right oh my think about think about people you talk to and they waste years and DEC I was thinking my dad but they wasted Decades of their lives I yeah I even talked to my barber yesterday I got a haircut yesterday and he said for years he said he's Heard a Voice saying take your family to church and he said he said I always would put it off one more week he said I'm too tired this week too tired I'm gonna go to church and they said well I don't want to wake the kids up they're going to be grouchy and so look Satan will give you every excuse every excuse and I look I didn't look at him because I was getting my haircut I said I said brother I said that was God Almighty speaking to you that was God nudging you he said he said that voice keep ringing to my head I said that was God's voice telling you to take your children to church Hallelujah you said finally then last week he said finally I got up out of bed and I went to I took my family to church and they were happy to be there Hallelujah see God's trying to get him in translated into a new kingdom but Satan will be right there to give you every excuse not to obey the word of God but what do we got to do we got to keep praying and petitioning the church see we have great victories our lives are so much better praise God now he told me no I'm getting back to my friend he told me as years of regrets for not taking some of his church some one of his child is already an adult and he lit look at that church he's got to live with years of regrets and he knows those years were wasted but not us you and I don't have to be that way we know we obeyed God we heard that still Small Voice knocking week after week and we went to God's house we know we invested our time Hallelujah ladies just graduate I thought where's all the time went all I can say is I know I put it in the right place I invested in my time in the house of God Amen I can't remember all the details I can't remember all that but I know I did it right I know I put her in the prince of God and now she's in the kingdom of God hallelujah she got translated herself in the kingdom of God hallelujah but see if not we're going to spend have years of regrets don't get me wrong because of sin we'll all have some regrets but I'm saying because of God's grace we can now be in the kingdom of God now we can be translated in the Kingdom of Christ see it's your let's spend our lives as an offering to god let's spend your whole life is just worshiping God your whole life is worshiping in spirit and Truth your whole life is praying and making your petitions known unto God and church we should be able to say to God honestly that's enough for me if I'm not the most popular preacher if I'm if I'm not the most popular song leader if I have nothing of that my life would be worth it just to sing your praises and pray it'd be worth it praise God it's worth it it's a blessing remember David said he ran for he lived in tents and caves for 13 years and then he said betters one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere praise God Amen I'd rather dwell in the house of God than dwell the tents of the wicked he realized this life is the best life we're living our best life now that's jealousy's book now it's a it's a Prosperity book so we don't read the book but we're living our best spiritual life now by God's grace that we're going to live until we get a new body Hallelujah we're Kings and Priests unto God no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we're peculiar people zealous unto good works my goodness it doesn't appeal to us their lives that doesn't is that there's nothing about that that makes me oh I want to be like that sinner there's nothing in my heart that wants to be like them I just want to be what Jesus made me to be and I'm going to be happy with that praise God I'm happy with that their life their lifestyle doesn't appeal to me I don't care if they get a vacation every uh every month they get a vacation that life doesn't appeal to me because what do they do they go waste their time and they got to end their day every day with some with some alcohol or champagne I was going to say they got to drown out their sorrows and regrets like that I don't want to live like that I don't live a life with no regrets praise God that's why this this is why we got to emphasize this because it reminds us our lives are worth it just by worshiping praying serving God hearing the word it's all worth it because that's what God called us to do amen that's what he wants us to be Kings and Priests Hallelujah we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father that's what I want you to have church I want everyone to have that today every day realize I'm a New Creation in Christ let's remember what Christ has called us to be new creatures different person than what we used to be praise God now I just put this up here remember this is the Millennium scripture now look church if you can judge your life now the Bible said you're going to be on the throne and judgment's going to be given to you just like the queen of the South Jesus is going to say okay queen of South Lydia just stand up Jesus will say Lydia queen of South rise up and condemn this generation of Pharisees and now can you say that can you say I condemn you I condemn you Pharisees even with Grace thank you and you can take a seat that's what Jesus going to do he's going to say rise up you're going to condemn and it's going to be in your lips it's going to be in your your lips are going to speak the Judgment upon these things so you better know how to judge it right now right that's why we're here judgment begins at the house of God hallelujah if we can judge situations correctly now by God's grace we'll judge him perfectly there because we'll have a new body but notice the Bible says they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years if you can Reign now you'll Reign later what really Reigns over our lives it's the word of God it's the word of God and I'm trying to get somewhere here's the verse I want to bring out okay so I haven't preached on this for a while I don't maybe in the Mighty Man series but just remember this now this is a beautiful chapter this is right after Isaiah 53 and that's the chapter uh I won't play it at my funeral there's uh there's an hour if the Lord tears and I don't go in the Rapture Everybody Makes You Remember read Isaiah 53 at my funeral praise God I want everybody to know that Jesus Christ healed me praise God he was wounded for Jesse Smith's transgressions but with Jesus's Stripes Jesse Smith was healed amen praise God Hallelujah in the next chapter Isaiah talks about view the land married land how he's going to restore Israel back to the rightful position this is speaking of Israel but we can see how it applies to Christians too no weapon that's formed against thee shall prosper now that is quite a thus saith the Lord think about all the weapons in this world you got knives you got guns you got tanks you got planes he got all kinds of weapons people drug people to death you know they put drinks they put poison their drinks there's all kinds of weapons that are against us but God said no weapon that's formed against thee shall prosper that's a hundred percent Victory Church no well the most of the weapons won't Prosper that's not what he said he said there's no weapon that's formed against you that will prosper praise God oh my God that your guaranteed Victory praise God you're guaranteed there's no weapon there's no trick there's no snare there's no attack that will ever Prosper against you in other words every weapon against you will fail amen every trap Satan says for you you'll overcome it praise God this was the Israel what much more amen much more do we have better promises and greater blessings in the New Testament of the blood of Christ amen no weapon that's formed against you Austin will prosper I can put all your names there sisters there no weapon that's formed against you will ever prosper oh Satan roams the Earth trying to find somebody he can devour he's like how can I form a weapon against brother so and so sister so-and-so the Bible says that in job he roams the Earth thinking of ways and snares I can set this trap and each time he's going to fail amen no matter how much he brainstorms no matter how smart he thinks he gets he is he can't outsmart Christ Hallelujah because we have a promise there's no weapon will prosper against his children Glory that makes me feel happy today that was worth it coming to church right there wouldn't it no weapon Satan forms could ever Prosper against you in other words he's eventually going to run out of power he's eventually going to he's eventually going to quit and give up didn't the Bible say he left Jesus for a season trials May last for the night but joy comes in the morning praise God it's gonna change things like we said Jesus is going to turn the page The Season's Gonna Change you're gonna feel different you're gonna feel better you're gonna get the victory Jesus changes everything praise God ah Hallelujah every tongue that shall rise against you Malachi in judgment Thou shalt condemn think about that there's going to be Devils trying to condemn us and the Bible said everyone will be silenced and will condemn them why because they're lying church just always believe the truth praise God always speak the truth not most tongues against you sister who every tongue amen every tongue Karis anyone that tries to say anything and any weapon Satan tries to form against you it will fail God is totally protecting his children the great Shepherd protects his sheep Hallelujah they're defenses without him but with him they're more than conquerors Hallelujah amen remember you've already passed from Death unto life there's no way I can die and go to hell I've already got eternal life I've already got everlasting life and it was freely given I didn't earn it it was through Christ this is the Heritage or this is the possession or inheritance that's what the word means this is the inheritance of the Servants of the Lord oh I get that just for being a child of God that's my inheritance Glory because I'm God's child no weapon will ever ever overcome me right and anyone who tries to condemn me I'll overcome them I'll silence them you're set up to succeed there's no way we can fail it's impossible to lose amen praise God remember if he's got weapons then don't forget he's not the only one with weapons you've got weapons praise God the Bible said we don't war after the flesh for the weapons of all Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen yes he's got weapons but I've got stronger weapons amen he's pretty big but I'm greater I'm greater by Christ than me because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world praise God Hallelujah oh he looks pretty great the obstacle is pretty great but greater is Christ in me so no weapon will no weapon will prosper against me it won't work now God mail out like job God may allow you to suffer for months but it's ultimately going to end it's ultimately going to fail you're going to keep the faith you're going to keep God's word because what do you do with your weapons you cast down every stronghold you break down every complex you cast out any imagination like I think this is going to happen or I'm worried about that you cast that down with your weapons you break down anything any obstacle in your way you break it down so you can run the race Hallelujah anything that exalts itself against God you cast it down and then you have a Readiness to obey the Bible says when your obedience is fulfilled so see that's when you know you're using your weapons when you're obeying the word of God Hallelujah I love praying that sometimes I pray like that Lord I've had two weeks or I've had three weeks I've had a month of all these victories I've been obeying your word right because we all struggle with things I say and that just don't encourage me Lord you know Satan's trying to condemn me and make me feel bad but I'll say Lord look at this I got the victory praise God I know you're with me praise God I feel good no this weapon that's formed against me is not prospering but I'm prospering praise God such an encouragement I'm obeying Hallelujah and now God can fulfill his word in me because I'm obeying the word of God hallelujah oh thank you Jesus so let's just look at this simple examples now I've got your Bible go to Nehemiah chapter four I'm gonna just briefly go through these so in job's life could any weapon that was formed against job prosper no no these are some pretty powerful weapons though Church now don't forget your weapons are greater but one of the weapons was death of his children that was a weapon against job but it couldn't prosper and in this case prospering meant job would Curse God That's what Satan was trying to get him to do just Curse God but that weapon didn't work imagine just like job would imagine job just being his bombs are being thrown at him boom he just stands there boom Another bombing he's just stand there and all these weapons Satan's fighting shooting all these weapons out then he loses his finances then he loses his health all these weapons are coming against him but he still stands there and says I won't quit amen you won't Prosper against me I'll overcome you devil that's what he was doing no none of the weapons all these these are serious weapons but he realized I have a greater weapon his weapon was My Redeemer Lives I know my redeemer lives and I'll stand with him on that Earth praise God at the last day praise God in my flesh I shall see God that's his weapon I'm a Child of God God is my Lord I serve God and I'll see Christ amen oh some serious weapons some of us have to go through that losses family members loss of finances but you you have weapons to overcome them because you're going to reign in this life and that and then that will make you reign in the next life right Noah Satan used the weapons of mockery they mocked him for 120 years science mocked him right that was the weapons oh look scientifically this has never happened before it's never the rain doesn't come down rain comes up it's never happened before you're wasting your life you think you're uh some type of a boat man you never even sailed in a boat you know just mocking over and over again his goal was to destroy Noah but Noah overcame all those weapons couldn't overcome Noah because greater was he that was in Noah than he that was in the world praise God Joseph my there was a lot of weapons used against him he was rejected by his family now how many how many been rejected by their family that's a serious serious weapon serious bye he was enslaved he became a slave right he couldn't leave his work now we are happy we get to leave our workplace don't we at the end of the day I got to leave I got the clock out thank you guys see you tomorrow I'll see you after the weekend not not Joseph he was a slave the weapon look at that weapon constant slavery constant work no Escape I'm never going to be out of slavery but that weapon couldn't conquer God God was fighting for him praise God at the end of his life he forgives the brothers and said you know you didn't do this God allowed this so I could save lives amen hallelujah those weapons couldn't Prosper against even false accusations and even prison time two years of prison time couldn't conquer Joseph because a greater one was in Joseph Joseph knew the word of God has come to try me I'm just being tested but I will overcome praise God all those bombs of rejection and and accusations in prison he just stood there and he stood there he's able to stand against those and so I'm still fighting for God hallelujah I'm not giving up the fight I'm not laying down the sword I'm not going to quit now I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus we got some of those today we got some more than conquers in here hallelujah see I didn't get to finish my thought because it kind of came to me freshly right before service but Moses Satan used the weapons of past failures he ran from his people for 40 years he ran murder Satan whisper You're a murderer Satan actually moved him to murder think how awful that would be you've took someone's life church I would say like that you know when God lets us go to those types of deep sins like murder he has to give us a burning bush experience because of all of the awful things we've done like Paul Paul perfect example Paul sat there watched Stephen get murdered yes I'll hold your coat kill him he's bleeding he's dead yeah here's your goats guys he'd have to hear the voice of God to know he's forgiven he'd have to Now isn't that Grace and Paul said my life is a pattern for them that will believe thereafter amen amen so no matter what you've done you've got to trust God that the free gift cleanses you from all unrighteousness amen it's a free gift Hallelujah it helps you to reign in this life Hallelujah it translates you out of your own life into a new life praise God he overcame the complaining of the people that was a trap from Satan he overcame the rejection right the People speaking against him he overcame fear why God what do I do now he says why cry unto me speak and go forward there's no weapon that was formed against Moses that he couldn't overcome Hallelujah Mordecai you know that one right Haman he went about a Heyman went over this a few weeks ago he wouldn't bow he just everybody I think about that everybody else in the church would bow down to Haman everybody else now hopefully we got a church of Mordecai is here let's not bow to the world right let's not bow to peer pressure let's not bow to sin let's stand praise God and so Satan builds this weapon of a gather I'm going to hang you more to God I'm hanging you on this and yet he withstood it he just kept doing what's right all the time he no what'd he do also he got on his uh he got in prayer he got a sackcloth and Ashes he got that I started praying to God asking Esther to intercede he didn't sit there and do nothing he went into his office of a priest Hallelujah amen and that weapon that was formed against him was ultimately used against the one who built it Haman Haman got what he deserved he reap what he sowed but so did Mordecai Mordecai saved the king so the king exalted him praise God amen that's what we learned from these Old Testament Saints stand upon the word of God and God will fight for you any weapon Satan has uh thought against you it will not prosper think of Daniel they said the weapon of the the Lions but the Lions didn't conquer him praise God hallelujah those weapons couldn't overcome Daniel because Daniel had a relationship with God he prayed to God just like you got amen well there's an hour and 15 here so let me go a little bit later now Nehemiah yeah Nehemiah chapter 4. I want you to see what Nehemiah overcame chapter 4 verse 1. Nehemiah 4 verse 1. you know the reason I'm reading this is because I just uh I'm almost finished with Nehemiah and I've just been freshly reminded of this remember Nehemiah cried before where he was sad before the I think it was Nebuchadnezzar not mistaken whichever Babylonian King it was and he said why are you so sad you've never been sat in my presence he said my people or without a temple and there's I'm sorry they have a temple but they have no wall and so the king pays for him gives him all this money all this all this protection to go back and he he rebuilds the wall in 52 days a church just just let that be an encouragement if you want victory over a certain sin let's give God how about we give God 30 days it don't have to be 52 days say Lord give me a victory this in this month July here we are July 2nd right you can say Lord yeah 30 30 more days left help me to consecrate on you and help me to build a life that's help me to build up a defense against this trial or this lust or this this temptation right right that's that's basically what he was doing he said I need 52 days and I'm going to build this wall up and now we're going to have protection that's why people like you know a 40-day fast or you know whatever seven day fast now not hurting yourself but people like to have a certain number of days because they know there's Victory and good habits but Nehemiah 4. but it came to pass that when sambal heard that we build the wall he was Roth and took great indignation to mock the Jews and he spake before his brother in the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in the day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned and but now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they built a fox go up he shall break down their stone wall look at this mocking he's mocking a child of God that's going to build a wall he says he calls him feeble that's not what the devil's calls you you're such a weak Christian you have no strength well you're lying again devil there you go lion again and look he had to overcome these weapons what were the weapons the war of words that's that's why I think we this applies to us we don't battle physical demons right we don't battle uh people that want to arrest us and shoot us and put us in prison or cut off our heads or something but it's war of words that we battle just like Nehemiah but Nehemiah he responded the right way praise God so what does he do in verse 4 hear o Our God for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity amen so when he when he's called weak when he's when he's mocked and said oh even a fox will knock over your wall when he's mocked and made fun of what does he do he goes to prayer amen he goes to his duty as a priest Hallelujah he doesn't get weak he strengthens himself in the Lord praise God twins people speak against you what do you got to do pray for them now later on here I'm just for time's sake I'm just I'm just gonna read this enemies then threaten to attack so the People Prayed and then set up guards in verses 8 through 15. then they send threats now you ever get a threat before I'm gonna do this or I'm gonna do this to your name or I'm gonna make people say this about you I'm gonna do all these things threats threat threats and what does he do pray pray and then he sets up protection and brothers said prayer is our Garrison's so Garrison's our Lookouts right for enemies so when Nehemiah got threatened he set out Lookouts so when we get threatened we should look out through prayer Hallelujah more prayer more prayer he reminded the people to trust in God and he paired the soldiers so while one worked the other stood by and then he also set up a signal for a trumpet call they could rally together and trust God to fight for them Hallelujah so the more Satan attacked him with these weapons the more he set up we're going to work together as a body of Christians I need you to pray for me brother amen all week that's what he was saying we're going to work together while you work I'll I'll guard while I guard you work we're going to set up a buddy system amen Hallelujah and we're going to have a group text when we need prayer Hallelujah when we need prayer I'm going to send out a group text everybody praise God we're going to blow the trumpets and everybody come right here everybody ride around here let's fight because no weapon that's formed against us shall prosper because we reign in this life by Jesus Christ Glory and then church remember they tried to draw him out of the city in chapters 6. yeah later on chapter six they say come come for a meeting over here and let's talk about this he said I'm not leaving this work I'm not leaving my post to duty and the church said I'm not leaving where God called me to be a priest and the King I'm standing right here you know what he says he says you weren't called to build this wall I was called to build this wall Hallelujah right let's not leave our post annuity let's say right where God called us to be let's remember where God called us lest not forsake God the Bible said when you leave the church you forsake you abandon the church let's stay right with God's people let's say write the poster Duty let's not be distracted let's stay in our position praise God amen all right Hallelujah and then they tried to then they just gave him threats but he overcame all their threats by just praying having a battle plan how many got a how many got a battle plan next time a Temptation comes I know for sure Haven has done that in her life like she she testified about you know having night fears she set up so many battle plans I just want to encourage her encourage my little soldier back there she'd first draw a picture with something that was a scripture she could look on and then she started memorizing the scriptures then she'd pray with me some nights or pray with Christian Some Nights amen set up battle plans if you want to overcome you got to have a plan praise God Hallelujah pretty soon you get the victory don't you Haven Hallelujah that's what Nehemiah did no weapon that was formed against him could Prosper Nehemiah overcame and you overcome in less than two months the church if we really get our we really get focused on something we can overcome but we got to get focused on it we've got to build up our strength got to build up our walls build up our protection build up our prayers Hallelujah I think uh yeah I was just going to close with those well let me just close with these last few Jesus the weapon that was formed against him was crucifixion I kind of already preached on this but what did he do he went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray he said father let your will be done not mine will be done that's how you overcome a weapon did you say God let your will be done amen don't let my will be done let your will be done in other words Lord give me the grace to go through this if you want me to go through this if you want me to suffer the uh the Pains of this weapon the enemy has against me then give me the grace to go through it praise God and I will I'll go through it let your will be done not my will but how do you do it by the joy one day we're gonna have a glorious Church Without spot or wrinkle or maybe you could say in 50 days we're gonna have a born-again church Hallelujah I see it praise God I've seen it in my vision praise God the Father showed it to me and he shall see his seed after him praise God and they'll possess the gates of their enemies praise God he suffered through the present in order because he knew there's a better future coming let's do that today by God's grace let's suffer through the present with our eyes on the future remembering you know it's got to be a good future it's got to be one God promised it's got to be the will of God hallelujah then you get the victory so church what do we got to overcome remember I'm closing you gotta in laodicea you gotta oftentimes overcome the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions you got to overcome those those are the three that we're gonna have to overcome the most but you can because there's no weapon right of a pressure to be wit uh pressure be rich there's no weapon that's a that's a rich or a million dollar Temptation or something that's never going to be able to conquer you and let me say this probably maybe more applicable for all of us nervousness there's no stress that's going to be able to ever Prosper against you Rachel have you ever felt stressed this week okay most people are honest that's a weapon that Satan has tried to form but you have thus saved the Lord no weapon will prosper against you that nervousness will not overcome you thank God amen amen amen because you have access the Bible says to a transformed mind you have access to power love and a sound mind how do you get that the Bible says Romans 12 present your body as a Living Sacrifice before God you have to talk to God just like Nehemiah you got to pray just like Jesus you got to pray just like Joseph you got to pray Hallelujah that will cause all those weapons to be defeated the simple prayers of the Saints or if you need prayer I'd be happy to pray with you today now maybe soft living see sometimes we make our lives so easy that we don't have to pray for certain things right like that's what the brothers always say when they come from overseas they say Americans hardly have to pray for food they already got to pray for anything and so then they pray less so they get less spiritual blessings but the Saints where they got to pray for food they also pray for miracles they also pray for healing because they don't have doctors so they get more miracles you see a correlation the more prayer more blessings but we still have the promise no weapon will prosper against us these are the these are the weapons that are formed against us Satan wants us to feel tempted and nervous to be rich nervous to have more Goods and he wants us to feel like you don't need more of God because you say oh I have need of nothing I don't have to go to church I have to read my Bible I have to pray that's a weapon that's formed against you but by God's grace church we will prosper because the Bible says above all things I wish you prosper in health even as your soul prospers that's the end of our feet musicians can come how many are thankful that you have a hundred percent chance to overcome the weapons of Satan you have a hundred percent promise there is no temptation there is no test that's formed against you that can defeat you that's why I say church I'm not ashamed to say it we already are an invincible Army I know the bride's going to be Heather ladder rain I know that I know she's going to be Invincible there but I'm already invincible because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world praise God and I got the same promise Israel has that was to Israel but God had to put Israel away and get a new bride amen Hallelujah so this has to apply to us this is beauty of the land this is married life this is our married life Jesus is going to protect his bride Hallelujah be defeated any trial any test anytime Satan comes around like a roaring lion we've got the fire of the Holy turn that line back how do you believe that let's bow our heads now Church think about if there's weapons that are formed against you let's pray today that's all Nehemiah had to do that's all Jesus had to do any weapon that was formed against him he just had to pray and remember that God was fighting for him now we are the sons of God now we are the dogs and we have access into disgrace right now let's bow our hearts here for a moment father God we thank you for the word of God we enjoy the songs how we enjoyed singing We enjoyed praying and interceding in those prayer requests Lord now you've heard the word though Lord tell us that we reign in this life because there's no weapon that's stronger than you Lord thank you God our weapons are mighty we're not we Christians we are Mighty Christians you're giving us the weapon the authority of the name of Jesus Christ but I trust your people we're encouraged today Lord I trust your people we're reminded you reminded them of Your Love he reminded them of your promise that they'll never be defeated they've already passed for nothing to life all I think of the weapons Satan has brought against me Lord and each one help me thank you thank you for your blessings I want to thank you for your promises thank you that this is the inheritance of the children of God you save us and then you give us this promise you give us this reward for this possession no weapon will prosper against [Music] job's life Daniel Joseph Moses Nehemiah you permanent the life of your son Jesus so we know to be true in our lives as well help us to build up a wall help us to build up a defense help us Lord to set up Garrison's a prayer Lord God so we can be strong in the faith giving you glory remind us Lord we don't have to be a slave to nervousness in order to be tempted into Easy Living you don't have to chase riches we have to chase the heart of God you want to be like David a church after the Heart of Jesus Christ Our Lord that's your people they've been very impatient they've been very attentive to the word of God and I pray now don't water these words these seeds of God may they water them with praise may they water them with prayer Lord God hallelujah [Music] may they use these Mighty weapons of our Warfare to cast out anything that assaults itself against the word of God today we thank you Lord in your holy presence you're asking all these things in Jesus Christ
