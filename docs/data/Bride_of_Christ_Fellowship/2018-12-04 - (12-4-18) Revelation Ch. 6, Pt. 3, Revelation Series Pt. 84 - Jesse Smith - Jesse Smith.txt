there having all your names on the book amen glory let's take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace I like to go to Revelation chapter 6 I like to continue the eruption theories this is part 84 hard to believe 84 parts on the book of Revelation hour 84 Revelation chapter 6 part 3 we'll look at more on the sixth seal tonight by God's grace Revelation chapter 6 I've been listening to a 1961 sermon brother Graham called the ten virgins 144,000 kind of preparing for Roe nation chapter 7 and found some good thoughts and good quotes in there and a lot of understanding but today we like to look at the sixth seal in chapter 6 by the grace of the Lord looking at verse 12 revelation 6 verse 12 verse 12 and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand not what a what a portion of Scripture how many glad that you don't have to see that praise God a man of our heads for word of Prayer never need on your heart just making known unto God Heavenly Father Lord we were come to this most important time of your word dear God let it be a guide to us or let it be life to us that would be a light unto our path Heavenly Father speak to us here tonight you see the hands that have needs Lord God just used me that your spirit Lord guide me Lord to what I must say and do for thy glory and father Lord that you called preaching Lord God the foolishness Lord but yet it brought more life and salvation and deliverance O God to the world it's foolishness Lord but to you it is life and so father we pray you speak life to us here tonight Lord use each and every heart Lord God meet every need God for your glory we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless yours being to see the praise God so let's look at this thought here I like to look at part three on the sixth seal I won't look at some of the symbols again tonight by the grace of the Lord now some of these things as we said a few weeks ago all of these things in the sixth seal are after the church ages and the sixth seal has a horse rider it has no beast it doesn't have any of that it's just a pronunciation of destruction upon the earth we know that God created the earth in 6,000 years right each day was a thousand years with the Lord and brother Ram said has God had six thousand years Satan had six thousand years to do damage to the earth but God is going to bring it back after that six thousand years here we are at the very end of it we're at the door praise God hey man hallelujah we're close to the rapture Church we're close to the rapture that we've ever been and you know people see the finish line in a race it makes them run a little faster we see the finish line tonight and all to make us run a little faster or to make us want to finish even better for the kingdom of God amen you know I was never a distance runner but I know as a sprinter if I saw that it was the end of it I was going to push with all I had left last year at school I ran a mile with no practice and the last few stretch I just ran with it whatever I had I paid for it the next day but whatever I had left at the end you had to run it in and give it all that you got and that's what we've got to do we've got to keep pressing no matter how hard it gets how busy we get how much life seems like it's overwhelming we've got to realize we're at the end praise God and we've got to give God all that we have for his glory now I want to bring out a few things here just maybe things that you have read here before and notice in verse here it's in verse 12 as soon as the sixth seal opens there's a great earthquake now this might be of course connected to the seventh seal because when the seventh seal opens there's also an earthquake it may be the same earthquake which I believe at this point I believe it'll be the California earthquake I believe it'll be after the rapture but I could be wrong you know it doesn't really matter we have to be born again anyway doesn't matter it doesn't matter when the temples rebuilt and Jerusalem it doesn't matter what earthquake happens in California none of that really matters to us because that shouldn't even pertain to us what should pertain to us is God's kingdom amen those things you know those does we don't even don't even move us you know I see posts online you know about earthquakes and I appreciate people quote or posting them I appreciate people posting things about Israel but really that shouldn't be our motivation our motivation should be the holy spirit inside of us telling us your husband is ready to come and you must get ready for your husband amen it's not a fear that makes us ready it's a love that makes us ready but there's there's a great earthquake and remember there Thursday there's a great earthquake also after the seven sea opens and program tells us the seventh seal is the day and hour of rapture we know that rapture and is buying off the earth so there's a great connection here to earthquakes and then a Sun and Moon in verse 12 there's a connection the Sun becomes black and the moon becomes as blood and these are only seen in two other scriptures acts 2:20 and Joel 2:31 okay so we see that the scripture that these are connected always to Israel the Blood Moon is always connected to Israel amen so you know a couple years ago in 2015 that man the preacher put out the blood moons and and I got to look for a few for a little while and then I talked to a preacher and and I started setting the scripture and then I I was no more worried about it because always the the blood moons are always connected to Israel and so if the Blood Moon was going to happen you know that really had nothing to do with us that was going to deal with Israel and so all the pressure was let off because when we look back to the word the word of God always is a time piece right the Word of God is always a light unto your feet and a light unto your path and so I didn't have to worry about that because the Sun being darkened and the moon is blood always is for Israel amen and so you and I realize that doesn't pertain to us and so we don't even act and we don't need those things our eyes really are on the natural Sun or the natural moon because we know where the spiritual men who praise God hallelujah in Christ our husband is then that is the spiritual son right where they were the spiritual moon and he's the spiritual son praise God we're not worried about the natural so much as we are the spiritual and we're saying son of God Jesus Christ shine and reflect off of my life amen I'm worried about that kind of a Blood Moon that the blood of Jesus Christ is on the bride of Jesus Christ that's the kind of Blood Moon I'm interested in amen and that's how we got to live our lives they may let the blood of Christ clean out our lives and then let his light reflect off of us praise God know the Stars of course are deal with the endtime as well and where they're mentioned in Revelation 8 as well under the fourth trumpet so again we see the six year which is tribulation connected to the fourth trumpet so again not really dealing with the broad of course now mountains and Islands are actually moved out of their places and that tremendous mountains and Islands moved are there places there are so much things happening here to the sixth seal Kings great and rich men even poor men all hide from the face of the Lamb right and they're all asking to be hid from Christ they're asking hide me from Christ isn't it so opposite Church we ought to come to church and saying Lord don't hide me from your face I want to be in your face I am seeking your face and so our attitude should be totally opposite Lord I want to seek your face I don't want to hide from you I want to run to you amen and this is the great day of God's wrath and notice verse 16 and they say and he said unto the mountains of the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb isn't it interesting the acts of nature such as an earthquake Stars falling are going to convince every single man Bhandar free that Jesus is pouring out his wrath on the earth amen that's what it's going to take people who are so backslidden that are so hard into the gospel that don't want to hear about righteousness they don't want to hear about a godly life the only thing that's going to shake them up is for the very world they live in to be shook Amen and shaken up but you and I should be different we should be able to hear we should be able just read the Bible pray hear our gospel being preached and it should shake our hearts amen Alleluia we know what we know if it doesn't something's wrong with our lives but man the Bible says we should assign crime n for the bombuh nation seeing people's conditions should make a sign cry you know even denominations I'm an email in this denomination a woman she was trying to correct me on Daniels 70 weeks and I thought well that's fine you know whatever but then she started to email me and I started mention about women preachers she files a woman preacher many ladies she files a woman preacher and we got to talking and but even she can recognize as the denominational Christian she can recognize that the fires out there in California were God's judgment upon the earth and it's enough to shake up her so so her watching TV watching all the you know she said people who even burned to death in their cars it was such an awful destruction and and we know in 1964 William Graham said judgment is striking the west coast it's already been pronounced so Christians who follow Jesus Christ know that the west coast is under judgment but even but even denominational Christians can get shaken by those type of things and they're saying oh we got to get ready oh we got ready but it's okay for me to listen to a woman preacher to see it's a false see they're getting shaken by by by fires they're getting shaken by all those things but it's really not shaking them to their core to really examine is everything I believe the Word of God but see we shouldn't we should have the sense of the Holy Spirit should be shaking us not by the things that we see by but the things that we know are going on in the spiritual realms amen in other words the near approaching of Jesus and the closer he gets then the closer we should get to him amen that's what we're gonna end the service with it's just a reminder about the wise virgin and what and how she lives her life now I want to look here and let's look a little deeper at the sixth seal so Malachi I'm gonna switch over here I got a little adapter I just thought I'd show a few things about the sixth seal tonight just as a reminder here by the grace of the Lord now I just do this to kind of help and just explain what brother Branham was bringing out here and I hope it's a help to you by God's grace some of these things that's just a little bit easier to list them out and put them on visuals so you can understand them a little better all right so let's look at this here now well the random says this he says the sink seals the Tribulation Period that's what takes place the ride has gone there's no living creature nothing there to say it God is not dealing with the church no more it's been gone he's dealing with Israel see this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelation 11 remember Israel's a nation God's servant nation and when Israel is brought in it'll be a national fair Israel the kingdom age is where David the son of David sits on the throne amen it just kind of struck me Church do you realize the very fact that you and I are here that Christians are here is what is keeping the islands of mountains in their places amen hallelujah the very fact that you love Jesus Christ and you thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ is keeping all the stars in their places amen God is keeping everything in nature in place because he's got a beautiful bride he loves here and he wants to protect her and he wants to make sure all those bride members get to know him and are born again and then he's going to take him off the earth and then all chaos is going to break loose upon the earth but thank God for His mercy for his life amen hallelujah it's his love it's it's your love for him that's holding this entire universe together amen hallelujah that's the power God's love amen glory but RAM says when messiahs cut off the Jew is blinded so we couldn't see them you couldn't see the Messiah and then come and then when the Messiah was cut off then the gospel and grace age come to the Gentile and they come down and God pulled one from here there here there and put them away under the messengers and here they're here they're put under the messengers they sent forth the first messenger and he preached and the trumpet sounded as we pick it up after a while and then the trumpet was declaring war trumpets always denotes war the messenger the angel come on the earth the messenger the hour like Luther's like any of the messages that we've walked or talked of what does he do he arrives and the seal is open reveals trumpet sounds war is declared and away they go and then the messenger dies he seals away this group they're put in and a plague falls upon those who rejected a seat and then it goes on then they organize get another organization all right now he says then here they come out with another power see another power another age of the church another ministry then when he does that along comes God with his ministry then the antichrist comes with his cyanne ties against and they run side by side amen now I want you to skip down to the blue here just about the time the Holy Ghost is revealing himself here in the last days the Antichrist is showing his colors coming through these politics and things and just about the time the Antichrist moves himself fully on the scene God moves himself fully to redeem his own amen Alleluia we appreciate what God has done for his church but we are looking forward to God fully coming on the scene amen Alleluia we appreciate how he's been on the scene but he's coming more fully on the scene just like Satan's coming more fully in the Roman Catholic Church amen and he talks about twins of course Cain Abel Crowe in the dove Judas and Jesus Jacob and Esau now I said that's exactly what plate takes place then God dealt with a Gentile so he took out a people for his name as soon as the dent Gentile Church is taken out he take it up the church and when he did the sleeping verge in the church itself the bride went up and the church itself was put in outer darkness where there's weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and the same time the tribulation falls on that people amen we know that's at hand and while the tribulations falling in there comes these two prophets of Revelation 11:2 preach the gospel to them and they preach a thousand one hundred and threescore daysy well that's exactly thirty days in a month like the real calendar has exactly three and a half one years that's Daniels 70th week the last part of this 70th week now let's just review this here now look at this timeline so here is the first two periods of Daniels 70 weeks Daniels 70 weeks is in three periods okay the first period is seven weeks which is 49 years and that's the command to rebuild and finish that the temple and so that took place now the second period was of course a lot longer this was sixty-two weeks okay that's 69 weeks right there so seven plus 62 is 69 weeks and that was 434 years of and that was most of Daniels 70 weeks now until the Messiah begins his ministry so there were 69 weeks until Messiah began his ministry so every with me so far this was Old Testament and here's the time of Christ now Christ didn't begin his ministry there until about 30 ad all right so that's your seven weeks and sixty-two week period there now before once Jesus Christ started preaching 69 out of the 70 weeks had been fulfilled all right now the next one here and now Jesus begins his preaching ministry about 30 ad alright now let me see what else I got on here sorry so slow yeah about 30 ad there you go all right now and then they get Daniels seventieth week was when Jesus started preaching all right so now we kind of zoom in a little bit here's Jesus start of his ministry now the Bible says in Daniel that the Messiah was cut off in the first half of the week after the first half of the week which is three and a half years so let's just put that on there so that was Jesus short little ministry of three-and-a-half-year ministry am i think about how powerful jesus did so much in three and a half years the bite of the world can't even contain the number of books that could be written about what he did I talk about a potent ministry talk about a concentrated substance right there my there's so much in that three and a half years you could even write about it and think about John the Baptist Church he was even more he was not as concentrated but he was really concentrated he only had six months of ministry and the Bible said he was the greatest man born among woman till that point greater than David amen greater than Solomon greater than Enoch greater than all these men his ministry was the greatest of any man born of woman in six month period that ought to make us encouraged because member more of God God is fully gonna reveal himself in this last age so that means we're gonna get more of God so that means no matter how short our ministry is our laterade ministry it'll be great in the eyes of God amen because he's fully gonna be with his bride amen that's right that arraign is the rapturing faith ministry if god can do great things in six months what about we'd say a month or however long the latter rain will take place man think about how great that would be now so now because of this God after the seven weeks was the forty-nine years there's the forty-nine years the next one is the sixty-two weeks of 434 years and then you have that little seventh 70th week the first half now after that God has inserted in this part a Gentile church age so God did sixty nine and a half weeks and then he took a break it's like God put at the brake on because he's gonna blind them so he can pull Gentile bride for his wife so he inserts a Gentile church for 2,000 years is that striking how God does it my 69 and a half years or weeks we'd say and then he stops right there so I'm just gonna take a break for 2 to 2 days I'm gonna take a two day break and get a wife Heather there we go and then after he digs his right up in the rapture he goes back to finish that second half of the 70th week that last half which is the Ministry of the two prophets now I don't know when the rebuilding of the temple is going to take place but here's the end of the church age just want to show it to you again to kind of refresh some of these things the next thing we're expecting church is the rapture of the bride the next major taking place after the rapture will become the second half of the seventh week which is called Jacob's trouble it's got some other names too it's called the Great Tribulation Period it's also called the sixth seal now we don't know when the rebuilding will be now the Ministry of Moses and Elijah we believe starts right after the rapture because when the bride goes up Christ the Holy Spirit I'm sorry the the Satan comes down to fill the Antichrist but also God returns to the Jews and these two prophets have a great powerful ministry Moses and Elijah and this is their time to minister for three and a half years now at the end of their ministry they die and they lay in the the streets for three and a half days and then they're raptured up to heaven at that point Jesus comes back so these three and a half years they've been preaching that Jesus the Messiah and they're doing all these supernatural signs at that point Jesus comes back to the remnant the Jews and then after this the 144,000 are sealed they're martyred you have the Vatican destroyed Armageddon fire Millenium there's all these events that take place right after that and like I said we don't know I'm not sure when the temple is going to be rebuilt it you rebuilt before the rapture it might be rebuilt after I'm not quite sure when it's going to take place but it's it's thus saith the Bible the temple is going to be rebuilt and like our brother said on Sunday it's a good it's a good sign when Trump places the embassy back in Jerusalem that's a good sign hey man the temple is not being revealed yet but it's a good sign see God is moving back towards the Jews amen hallelujah now there's many names for the sixth seal that we read tonight it's called Jacob's trouble but the RAM calls of the judgment seal he calls it the interruption of nature he calls it the great the Bible calls the Great Tribulation and Daniel 12 calls it a time of trouble those are all different names for how many of heard those names before those are all the names now brother man told us the order of Revelation the order of Revelation is very important the book of Revelation now he says it's necessary to in order to study the understand understand the rest of Revelation 4 are the church ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets and how the trumpets come the vials like the first burst of a roman candle the church ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination amen without which there could be no further light but once the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of Revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes are there yeah so our spiritual eyes should be illuminated by the church ages and then once we understand the church ages then they get illuminated by the Seventh Seal so here's the order so you the more you you serve God the longer you serve God the more illumination the more light you see in the book of Revelation hallelujah in Chapter two and three your eyes are lit up with the church ages and then another explosion my eye the seals is that what you felt like did you feel like the Holy Spirit exploded something in your life when you know when you knew the seals ha ha ha hey man that's what my dad says it's like another roman candle and i've seen where one time he shoot off one and he shoot off another you shoot off another until they run out and that's what he says the Book of Revelations like one shot after another shot and then the trumpets and then the rolls are kind of together and then the plagues and then the vials each one of these are another mighty illumination babe n-now what is light for light is supposed to expose darkness amen light is supposed to give you vision to see in church that's what these are see we're not just you know we're not preaching this just to know about it we're preaching this so the light of the Holy Spirit will light up your spiritual eyes so that you'll choose to follow Jesus Christ knowing the Bible said knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we should serve God more sincerely let me look that up real quick that description just came to my heart knowing the terror of the Lord let me look that up I know it's a New Testament scripture then we know offhand right where it's at okay okay second Corinthians five 11 you got your Bibles snicker in these if I have eleven so when we're preaching on the sixth seal on a night like tonight you know the last three services this is not a time for us to spiritually check out now now it's true it doesn't apply to us but brother Branham said its illumination this these things were preaching on with the sixth seal this should illuminate our eyes - and that should help us to see our lives more clearly and help us examine how we're living our lives because who here wants to be a part of the Great Tribulation who wants to see people who wants to go hiding is there is there any caves in Akron I know there's I know there's parks that have little caves cuz we went in the icebox one time now Lydia was a long time ago as a long time ago but we went to a park and they've got little ice caves can you imagine that the tribulation people are going to try to go hiding in those parks up I think it's Yoga Valley National Park I'm not mistaken they're gonna go hiding in their Bible said they're gonna hide in their say hide us from the wrath of the Lamb see these are illuminations to us it's supposed to light up our lives it's supposed to expose any sinner lives so we get all the sin of our lives out so we seek God's face rather than running from God's face sänger this is 5:11 so spiritually we don't think a break when we hear about you know preaching about the Jews it's supposed to be light to be a light unto our path now look at verse let's go to 10 verse 10 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ now that's not the white throne judgment that's the judgment for rewards that every one may receive the things done in his body according whether it be good or bad like I love that saying I heard it in a worldly movie but whatever you do in life echoes in eternity that is so true I know it was from a filthy movie when I was a sinner but I don't watch anymore but that's true that's actually your whatever you did in your life will echo and eternity whether good or bad oh god help us to do what we're supposed to be doing in this life amen let us do what's right in this life right now like the Bible says let's do good okay it's very simple let's do good things instead of bad things praise God verse 11 so Paul says we're all going to stand before the judgment seat of Christ and in verse 11 knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your consciousness see your life the word manifest means to appear or to show your life appears the life that you live appears to sinners it appears to Christians the life that we live is manifested and not only to them Church the life we the real life we live is manifested to God and so because we know the terror of the Lord we should be persuading others to serve God praise the Lord amen persuade him because we know the terror of the Lord as we said it doesn't take a California wildfire to move us it doesn't take an earthquake to move us in Anchorage last week a 7.0 that doesn't move us we should already be moved into serving God amen we should be daily moved into surrendering things in our lives over to Christ amen hallelujah there you go now that's the order and program said each one is another illumination that's supposed to make our eyes illuminated and see what God is going to do remember the Bible said that God will only show what he does to his friends how we know that Jesus said because you're my friends he said I no longer call you servants I call you friends because that's because a master doesn't tell his servants what he does but a master will tell his friends what he does hey this is God telling us what he's going to do and he's telling us because we're his friends amen hallelujah I'm glad to know about these things so I can preach on and persuade people that will listen on YouTube or that will listen try to persuade people to flee sin and run to Christ amen now program says this here now this is in 1961 by the way he's closing he said the seven seals the seven trumpets the seven vials the three woes the woman in red casting out the devil or the red dragon comes between these times during the Great Tribulation Period I want you to see their brother and we'll talk over a course of numerous years that all these things we know the fifth seal the sixth seal the seven trumpets the vows all these events take place during this Tribulation Period now let's get under the Green Man Star Mothers seven vials he said now they don't happen right at the same time following the plagues following the church ages just the same because it is all sealed up into that one book everything and everything happens just in rotation and one goes right into the other and other into the other amen the church they just rotate one into another after the trumpets and the lows and then the plagues and the vows it just flows it's like that the snowballing downhill effect once it starts it's going to be impossible to stop it's just going to go from one into another but thank God for these years of mercy thank God for these years of long-suffering now we should not sin same I wish God would judge these sinners and these homosexuals and these transgenders we shouldn't be like that we should say God have mercy God thank you for long-suffering because once that bull gets rolling then he that's filthiest filthy still may God have mercy may he keep being long-suffering I know it's hard to live here I know it's a Tain's either but we're supposed to be born together the Holy Ghost and when you're born again the Holy Ghost you're not even attracted to these taste of the world amen you don't flirt with the devil you don't program these things in the world we know it's hard we know we're still in flesh but we should pray for mercy we should be thankful that God's long-suffering because once it starts it's not going to stop I touched you know if the opposite is true for us once Jesus started the Holy Ghost in my life it's got rolling and it just rotates and the glory and faith in faith amen hallelujah because remember he leads you into all truth that's what the Holy Ghost was given for amen so the opposite is true for us amen it's just going to get more and more glorious as we see that Day approaching amen hallelujah now I tried to put these order of these events in order Church I don't know the exact time they'll break the Jewish and Roman Covenant I'm not sure program gives us a few little hints there I'm not sure and I'm not sure when the rebuilding of the temple is gonna be and I'm not actually even sure now when Armageddon is going to be because there's different quotes brother BAM says different things but it seems like this it seems the order the first is the rapture and then we have the Ministry of the two witnesses let's go to Revelation 11 let's read some of that here let's remind ourselves what's going to be happening for three and a half years remember this is after he's taken his his lovely wife off the earth these are the things he's going to do revelation 11 3 and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth that's three and a half years if you divide the 30s by or the the days by 30 verse 4 these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth that Zechariah chapter 4 and if any man will hurt them look at this fire proceedeth out of their mouth I love this now Church this just proves Satan can't hurt you or do anything to you until it's God's time for you to go amen God said I'm giving these two preachers three and a half years and if anything stands before them fire is going to proceed out of their mouths or whatever says it's not literal fire it's the word yeah so when enemies come against and also get to do and speak the word Church that's all you and I got to do amen enemy or trial comes against us we've just got to speak the word because the word is like fire amen exactly right and that proves as long as we're here as long as God wants us here we should be able to speak the word and watch the word devour up all of our enemies it might take a week it might take a month it might take years but the Word of God will not fail that fire is going to burn amen this summer I burnt a bunch of little trees that were sprouting up and I burned them the very day that I cut them which is not a good idea and it took a little longer you know earlier in us in the summer I burned all these dry ones and they burnt like that it was so fast and I just think I wasn't really thinking about I was just trying to get rid of and try to cut him down and so I wouldn't hit my head on him when I'm mowing you know and all these things and it took a while but Malachi came out and he started helping me out and it was then the instant burn but if I let it sit there and keep working with it pretty soon that fire is going to consume it and that's what we have to understand about God's Word pretty soon this word is going to start moving things amen pretty soon this fire is going to take its effect it might not happen instantaneous that's why God gave divine healing and miracles as two separate gifts America was instant but our faith should be just as strong in God's Word even if it's not an instant miracle we should self confidence that fires going to burn it's going to burn give it just give it some time if we believe the word if the words been spoken if their words then preach then let the fire burn it Amen give it some time praise the Lord the givers let's finish verse 5 fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed by the Word of God verse 6 these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy can you imagine a three and a half year drought in Israel you think that's going to get people's attention and church that's not even for mercy it's for judgment so this is gonna mean that they're gonna have three and a half years of no rain right cuz he lies is gonna call for it just like he did in his day praise God and it's a sign of judgment that's what's going to happen and then it says and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as off as they will and that's Moses's ministry right Moses turned the water to blood and then he brought forth as many plagues as he will now the best part of this is that as as many as he will and any true servant of God do it on his will he'll only do it on God's will and that's what you and I should be to we should only speak things we should only try to to ask God or speak to the mountain if we feel led of the Holy Spirit because if not it becomes a selfish thing it becomes a Santa Clause affair it becomes a errand boy God becomes an errand boy God's not our errand boy amen we are God's errand boys like that where the servants say so see they speak as often as they will but any true man of God any true daughter of God will only speak when God wills those are the only kind of people he can trust with his word anyway they won't try to create something or work themselves up or try to be a show-off or jump off a pinnacle the angels will catch me oh that's nonsense you must wait till God says it's time that's like about their testimony now for that verse 7 and when they finish their testimony the Beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them of course that's the that's the devil now so I hope you have that you have the death and then their rapture of the two witnesses after that Jesus returns to birth the 144,000 Jews remember the whole three and a half years they're preaching about Messiah they're preaching about son and brother branham said that the Jews can't deny it because the very one who wrote the law is now not pointing them to the law but pointing the artless are not exactly to the law but pointing to the law being fulfilled that the law was fulfilled Isaiah 53 was Jesus Christ genesis 3:15 the very one who wrote at moses and said there's the one who bruise the Serpent's head a muhammed they can't deny it the very one who was raptured elisha the very prophet here we'd say the very amazing prophet who was raptured he's not pointing them to the law he's pointing them to Jesus Christ praise God and that's the one I put on Facebook this morning Jesus didn't hear from I'll say Jesus heard from two theophanies on Mount Transfiguration he heard from Moses and Elijah about Transfiguration now brother Aaron says you heard from your theophany I believe it as far as I believe it might be right but I don't have a scripture for that yet but I do have scripture for people hearing from other peoples theophanies praise god or gods theophany but i can't find where somebody hears from their own theophany I can't find that yet in Scripture so let me know if you find one can I preach it in 2015 and no one's brought one to me yet that's okay keep searching the scripture so Jesus heard from two theophanies and the Bible said they talked to him about his decease on the cross so what does that tell us God has to send sometimes theophanies God has to send messengers from heaven to prepare us for what's to come amen hallelujah now for us many times God now I say like this God is going to send bromances gonna send us theophanies he said we're gonna see our loved ones rise before the rapture amen hallelujah praise God so just like Jesus before his his great victory before jeez got his great victory he saw theophanies brother says we'll see theophanies as well because the dead in Christ will rise first Oh hallelujah thank God amen and obably that's what's gonna be the main theme thing for rapturing faith when we see people that are dead amongst us oh now all things are possible to them that believe well we see James Browning and not he's not an old man he's a young man now you're gonna have some faith in church but that's how God does it God sends the faith at the time you need it is that right it's always in God's timing season you know as much as we fast very much as we try to amen and much as we try to it's really not gonna happen until it's God's time for it to happen but he wants to see people that will prepare for it amen hallelujah you don't want to see lazy Christians he wants to see people that are prepared and wanted and are making ready for it so when it comes it happened to them praise God that's right just as he sought the offerings before his victory we're gonna see him - amen and then after the 144,000 get born again then first four trumpets sound because of Revelation 7 let's read at revelation 7 one two and three I want you to really catch this here I read this the last time back in October when I preached on the sixth seal it's been a month or almost of the month and a half revelation seven one two and three I want you remember these scriptures here let me try it let me give me give me 15 more minutes okay I can finish up here and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of God in their foreheads so God is not going to hurt the earth God is not going to punish the earth until his children are born again of the Holy Ghost now that shows God's mercy does it not God is not gonna pour out wrath until he pours out his blessing first praise God in other words God is gonna make sure before he pours out wrath God is gonna make sure all those that want the Holy Ghost have the Holy Ghost amen out of the video like I said there won't be one person left behind the rapture that really wanted to be in the rapture because God will give everybody the desire of their heart because it's a free will offering he said anyone this thirsty let him come and drink of the Holy Ghost waters of life freely it's a free offering it's a free invitation everybody that wants to come can come that's exactly right now with that in mind see God can't hurt the trees of the earth until they're sealed with the Holy Ghost now go to chapter eight verse seven now this is why the trumpets can't sound so after the 144,000 get born again and 144,000 can get born again until after the two witnesses finished their testimony now look at verse seven and the first angel sounded this to the trumpet and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all the green grass was burnt up to see that the angel said don't touch the trees until the 144,000 are sealed and then God seal them and now the first trumpet can blow mmm and now the trees a third of them are destroyed a third of the trees on the earth are destroyed by the first trumpet but God's not gonna hurt a one of them until after the 144,000 are born again see that so that church to me this has to be the order of the events and then after the trumpets come the woes and the plagues and the valves as we said earlier praise God does that make sense everybody it makes sense okay all right now here's the quote where it sounds like like I don't know when the arm again is gonna take place but man said this very time the Antichrist covenant that the Jews were made with Rome will be broken Rome and her allies will send their troops to destroy off the god-fearing we're abiding Jews they're gonna make a covenant after the rapture I think it's gonna be a 7-year covenant but they're gonna break in the middle of the week again and then Rome is going to come and compass itself around Jerusalem now most you don't remember when I preached on the Book of Daniel we covered that I think it was in Daniel chapter 9 or 8 if I'm not mistaken the Bible said that the Antichrist will gather all those armies and the pump right down Jerusalem but Jesus is going to protect him the man said but as they come against the city Jerusalem to destroy it there will appear in the heavens the sign of the coming of the Son of Man with his mighty armies to destroy them who have been destroying the earth with the enemy repulsed Jesus then comes and presents himself to the hundred forty-four thousand having seen his mighty acts of salvation they have come to know his power but also seeing is to wounds and not rejected him even to that moment causes them to cry out in the agony of terror and fear even as their brethren of old when they stood before Joseph sore being sore afraid that they would be killed but as Joseph said don't be angry with yourselves it's all right God was in at all he did it to preserve life he blinded you Jews to preserve the life of the Bride of Christ even so will Jesus speak peace and love to them oh how rich is the love of God how deep is the love of God amen he blinded them to get a wife and then he comes back to the ones he blinded and he's speaking with peace and love to them oh what a what a sweet Savior our Lord is oh what loving what a loving Savior that we serve tonight Oh glory now for times sake um I'm not going to get to this one but but brother BAM said the six seals are in Matthew 24 I preached a little bit back in October but let's let's do this let's go to somewhere else let's go to Matthew 25 real quick let's read that the ten virgins again I know we've read it many times let's read it again by the grace of the Lord because I just want to say a last few comments here with the message tonight remember we're supposed to be illuminated our eyes should be should be sensing the light that comes out of the seals we should say my that's so bright like an explosion of a firecracker children remember the firecrackers we had this summer I mean they were really really not real firecrackers they were real child friendly frog crackers like the little ones that burned down sparklers there you go I can't even think of the little word sparklers but think of how bright children think remember how you like to wave them and it looks like you see lines that kind of stay in the sky think about the illumination of the fireworks and my man said that's what this the sixth seal should be that's what all the seals should be a mighty illumination Matthew 25 verse 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil and their vessels and with their lamps I just want them to stop and make a point here in this parable can everybody see how important it is that before you go out to meet the bridegroom you've got to take oil with you that's something I think with this parable we often forget this is all about preparation in church you know every every Church is going out to see the rapp every Church once Jesus to come back supposedly they're all going out to meet him oh we're making ready oh Jesus coming back soon oh it's the end of the world but only the lies are actually before they go out oh I better go get some more oil better get that oil better make sure I got it the fools just walk on sand oh yeah he'll come any time yeah let's go out but the wise they make a few extra steps right and if you're a wise Packer you'll take a few extra minutes to pack your bags a little bit more right just don't throw everything in there if you're a really wise planner you'll make sure oh yes he might delay the coming of the husband might be a little late longer I think I better take some extra oil before I go out there and and I would just hate I would just hate it if I ran out of oil then I couldn't be a part of the procession at church that's what we've got to do spiritually we've got to make sure there's no way I'm going to miss this wedding perception I'm gonna I'm gonna pack extra or in fact I'm gonna take an extra bag put extra oil in that bag amen I got the bag of my clothes I maybe got you know change your clothes I got my toothbrush in there I've got my my comb in there to comb my hair I've got an extra set of shirt and I got a jack in case it gets chilly but I'm gonna take an extra bag just to make sure it's filled with oil so they have the bridegroom tears I'll have extra oil to burn I don't have to worry about going at the last minute to get oil I'm gonna make sure I've got plenty of oil amen so the emphasis or the the major the major action for the wise is that they took more time to prepare and the foolish they realized it may be a longer wait than I think and I've got to really make sure that I've got the goods and church of the natural I'm not much of a packer Lydia packs our bags when we travel she does a great job I think Malachi started our acacia they do a good job and very rarely do they ever forget clothes but I can count about five times on my hand on the trips I've made preaching where I forgot either my suit my shoes my socks now I've got to go to Walmart the night before I preach and by the the cheapest brown shoes I can find because I'm that's the last thing I think about and that's my failure just in the natural it's like well I'll just you know I'll wait to the end but spiritually I'm the total opposite spiritually I know before I go out I know I've got to spend more time prepared more time praying more time making sure I'm born again I got to spend more time than my Bible I guess spend more time it says I can spend more time searching my heart I got to spend more time on that than I spent on anything else before I start telling people well I'm gonna be in the rapture now if anybody's give me the rapture it's me gonna be in the rapture before I start saying like that I'm gonna make sure I've packed up plenty of oil beforehand the church you don't know what trials are going to come in through your life people can say whatever they want but actions speak a lot louder than words as we know right so we should be so spiritually prepared there's no question there's no question we're going to make it because we brought plenty of extra oil right we've all seen people you don't try to run out run real quick oh I know the rapture is gonna come I'm not only gonna buy insurance because I know the rapture is gonna come I don't even have to go to school cuz I know the wraps are gonna come and we see after a few years that they don't run so hard and they lost their their zeal for the Lord right well I can I can run up my credit card like sister Karen brother Loris told us you know when they were serving God in the 70s they thought brother Branham said you know that Christ was going to come back in 77 so they ran up their credit cards and spent credit cars so they couldn't even overpay and they thought well I'm going the rapture anyway so might as well run up my credit card and their folly found them out see because God would never want a Christian do that in fact that'd be the last thing you want to do in fact brother said if you know the Rogers coming he said pay off all your debts don't run up your debts paid off be a real Christian you notice be sincere do a Christ we're doing amen yes there's a stop preparing but man said we got an unpack in order to go up he said people always packing up well I better get more I better get more but Barnes said if you in the Gulf you got to get lighter you got to get rid of all the cares of the world you got to get rid of that unpack unload unload all the burdens I'm not going to worry about this worldly thing I'm not going to worry about that I'm only going to be prepared to meet Christ but that's the part most people forget because look Church both fought Belt both fell asleep am i right the one who packed extra oil went to sleep as well see serving God you know it go after years everybody kind of gets a little tired even brother Jesse even you name your pastor your previous batch even then everybody gets a little tired everybody goes a little sleep sometimes we get a little tired on God but when the shout goes forth and it's time to wake up and it's time for the rapture then those who actually made the extra time to prepare and pack extra oil and really make sure they love God with all their heart soul mind and strength that really kept the first commandment that really laid there until something happened amen that really had a back shocker to experience those are the people that are gonna actually have the oil amen the ones that really made sure my life matches Acts chapter 2 I know what it's like in Acts chapter 2 because I've been in services where my testimony was noised abroad amen where I acted I I worshiped God I said how wonderful are the works of God and people saw me worship and I was so enjoying worshiping Jesus I didn't care who was looking at me because God was looking at me amen all I cared about was how much I loved God amen those are the kind of people that are going to be in the rapture they made sure they were born again they made sure before they went out started making making all these claims that they're gonna be in the rapture they took extra oil with them go to Ephesians 4 I'm going to close this season's for I've never really looked at this as a rapture Scripture until recently but it certainly is now I'm sorry it's Ephesians 5 farmy the asians 5 alright now this whole chapter would be good to read but just for times sake this chapter Scofield calls that the walk of the believer as God's dear child he talks about walking in love and not walking in sin now look at verse 7 be not therefore partakers with them with sinners for you were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord so you're like the moon you're lighting up with God's light walk as children of light for the fruit of the Spirit and all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto God so our church people in our church should think about is my or my actions good or wrong and then we should be able to prove that it's right for me to do this it's okay for me to do this or it's not okay for me do this because of the proof I found in God's Word praise God you should be able to prove that what you do is right in the sight of God Amen in verse 11 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them so we're supposed to separate from sinful people that do stand we're supposed to try to correct them as well look at verse 12 it's a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret so see there are certain sins that people do in secret we should even talk about let's not repeat certain things that are done in secret church and the church said we're not supposed to repeat them there's some secret sins people do don't even repeat them just say lord have mercy on them because it doesn't edify bursting at 13:00 but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for what silver doesn't make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fool's but as wise not alerting us that's verse 15 that's your wise and foolish virgin right there let me read again see that ye walk circumspectly which is specifically okay so you should walk specifically you should know as specifically what you're gonna do tomorrow and the church said you should specifically know I'm going to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit tomorrow now you might not know all the details but you should specifically know I'm gonna walk in the ways of God tomorrow that's circumspectly I know already I'm gonna choose to follow God I'm gonna do something to get closer to God tomorrow I'm gonna walk circumspectly all right verse 15 not as fool's but as wise so fools and now we're talking about foolish Christians foolish virgins they will not really care or they will not take as much care to make sure they're doing exactly what God wants them to do every day they kind of flow from one day to the next they've really got no vision they really got no direction they just cutting a hem halt and flow and not really sure about it but a wise Christian kind of plans out their day how they're gonna serve God and to make sure that they're pleasing God every single day of their life praise God how many wanted why's a fool doesn't walk circumspectly a fool like well we'll see what happens tomorrow I already don't have any plans for the morning nor do I got plans for the evening I know I got to go to work I know I got to go to school but they don't really choose to really walk and do what Christ wants them to do look at verse 16 redeeming the time because the days are evil so Christians are gonna redeem the time they're gonna buy back the time that's what we deem means to buy back and make it your own so that means you as a son or daughter of God you know what God wants done with this word and so you do it ahead out of the area you don't waste time you redeem the time Christians are the ones who actually make the best use of their time fools don't fools just kind of well if it happens it happens and whatever whatever goes it's okay whatever comes it goes that's what fools do but Christians are wise and they know what God wants done with his word so they do it and they plan to do it look at verse 17 wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is amen let's end our free right there we'll stop right there by the grace of God the wise Virginie what god's will was the wise version knew we're supposed to go out and we're supposed to wait until the bridegroom comes and so they they walked circumspectly they knew it might be a long wait so I better take extra oil they knew I might have to wait a long time I'm not going to rush into this I'm going to make sure everything's right if I'm going out there to wait I'm not going to just do it haphazardly I'm going to make sure I go out there and wait until I have to wait until I'm willing to stay there as long as they need to stay there in other words I'm not for this to be a short wait I'm in it for the long haul how do ya see some people get attracted the message oh oh just I just want to go home brother Jesse I've heard people say I just want to go home I just want to go in the rapture I just want to go home and pretty soon they find their home out in the world and it proved they really didn't want to go home yes they didn't like they didn't like the battles they didn't like balun saying but they really weren't invested into it to really do it for the long haul but Christians are in serving God for the long haul like we're singing I'll go the distance which I was a good song malachi to choose for the message i'll go the distance we didn't have that planned out but god had a planned out praise God now can you come here now can everybody see this we preach on the sixth seal has nothing to do with us in fact we're actually having a wedding feast with Christ at that time during the sixth seal but the light of it the tear of the Lord should make us persuade should impact our lives today and make us persuade people please serve God please love Jesus Christ please do anything you can do to get closer to Jesus Christ redeem the time you know eat how many times have you heard people say just in the last week minor children grow up fast I've had so many people tell me that wow you're shooting a girl fast my goes fast I almost every time to talk to you says that which is okay it's okay to say that but everybody knows how fast time goes so which people are making the most use of their time because the wise Christians will redeem it back they'll make it their own they're gonna stop saying all these days are slipping through my fingers instead they're gonna plan out their days and they're gonna make sure their body obeys the Word of God and bring their body into subjection to the Word of God well Graham said I like a man who's got goals praise the Lord I like a woman that knows what she's called to do we've got to know what we're up to do see then that you walk circumspectly not as fool's but as wise i want to how many want to walk a wise walk on this earth then let me pray for you that God will help you redeem the time it's all about what you choose to do with your time as we pray think about what you need to give up what's what's consuming even if it's just five minutes that's five minutes you could be here in the Word of God this is only a ten minute video this is only a little webpage you know this is only a half an hour I got a there's only an hour when it would be invested but think about is it the best use of my time is it redeeming it back is it walking circumspectly or on purpose [Music] because church the Bible says today's the day of salvation today the Bob said today don't harden your heart to God but have a soft heart towards God let's pray church if you ever need on your heart just raise your hand I'll pray for you you pray for me I'd like to redeem more of my time for the Lord these are evil days we all know that thank God for his long suffering and let's ask God to help us redeem the time we don't want to be fools with our time knowing the terror of the Lord we should persuade others to serve God but lets me persuade ourselves first Heavenly Father we come reverently tonight lord thank you for the light of the seals
