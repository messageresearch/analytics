not just saying that I was back I said man I remember that now it brought back to my remembrance the last time you sounded good the last time too so praise the Lord God bless you all uh it's good to see you again by the grace of God amen Amen brother my precious brother there he uh him and his brothers I was thinking earlier as I was thinking about them they're like my uh my brothers from another mother amen I always have a wonderful fellowship and time just with them you know as individuals and it's just a blessing man amen God bless you all I'm grateful to be here safely um everybody know about Debby praise the Lord the tropical storm or whatever making it up his way making it way up the coast and uh Wednesday it looked it didn't look too well you know in my hometown and I actually had to travel out of town Wednesday and Minister someplace that was closer to the coast and the Lord granted me traveling mercies but uh the rain was coming in pretty heavy the winds was pretty high and uh I would have rather not been on the road in those conditions but the Lord you know the Lord's work right it's like Lord if you send me you'll keep me and so I was glad to drive back in my driveway praise the Lord and it was a little cloudy a little dark kind of like I call it a Cincinnati weather you know uh on Thursday and uh I went to work Thursday and it that that weather kind of continued on so in my mind I'm like man I wonder how it's going to be because I had to drive from Columbia to Charlotte to fly out it's about an hour or so and I was like man I wonder how the weather is going to be we got to fly and we got a hurricane with the winds and want nothing happen to the plane to bring it down you know and so I just got you know being human right just got these thoughts to pass I'm like well Lord if you send me you able to keep me and per Adventure if he would have permitted that the plane go down and whatever evidently it would have just been my time and I would have been in a much better place praise God Amen how many feel like that amen when this life is over now we going to really begin to live amen we enter into a part of our reward amen by God's grace amen so uh oh death where is your sting amen praise God so nonetheless though we're here I'm grateful oh and then I'm coming here this I'm driving Charlotte this morning and I saw the sun coming out I was like man hold on it was just windy and raining last night and I'm driving further up and I'm still not seeing no signs of the storm actually got on the plane and now we flying and everything was nice I was like well praise the praise the Lord man so I'm grateful for that all right enough about me uh it's good to see you let's get on into the word by God's grace um let's go to the Book of James it's the Book of James um we're going to go to a few chapters in James mainly one and chapter three so chapter one we'll go to first then we'll go to chapter three and we'll start at verse 19 and chapter one and I'll just read these two chapters the verses here and then let you be seated uh James 1 and9 it says wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak he says and slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God if any man among you seem to be religious verse 26 I'm sorry if any man among you seem to be religious and bridle not bridleth not his tongue but uh deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain says my brethren be not many Masters I'm sorry moving too fast chapter 3 verse one okay says my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all but if if if any man offend not in word notice what it says here it says the same as a perfect man and able also to Bridal he says the whole body it says behold we put bits in the H's mouths that we may that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be a great be so great are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small Helm withs soever the governor listed even so the tongue is a small is a little member it says and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth it says and the the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and Seth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire it says of Hell amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we love you and that's why we're here Lord uh it's it's an expression of our love for you Lord God to to let you know father that we do Lord desire to know more about you Lord and that we need you we have a great need for more of you in our lives Lord to cause your word to be establish Lord and to live inside of us father God that's our desire Lord and I pray that you would bless every heart that's here Lord these are your precious people father God and Lord may you just take your word now and take it to our hearts Lord and Lord let it manifest what you purpose for it to manifest Lord God at this time we commit this service to you we thank you for brother Jesse Lord the precious pastor of the flock that you've placed him over lord God we pray that you would continue to strengthen Lord help him Lord and guide him and give him wisdom continuously by your grace Lord Jesus and father we just commit all these things into your hands forgive us of our sins and of our iniquities Lord Jesus father we don't desire to walk wrong we want to walk right Lord we want to walk as Enoch walk Lord God lord to the point to where you gave him a report father that he pleased you Lord how how much of a blessing is that heavenly father so Lord let us be that father in this day by your grace Lord through the power of your spirit living and working within us Lord in our name in your name the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask these things and we pray Let the church say amen amen amen you may be seated Saints praise the Lord hey man I uh I didn't know I was going to minister on this tonight I thought it was one thing that the Lord was really dealing with my heart deal dealing with me and my heart on before I left home andan that's been building up for a few weeks there and then uh I got to praying on the plane and I was like you know I was kind of praying in a particular way and I you know my prayers went in a certain direction and I'm just kind of feeling right it's like Lord you know maybe this is it because it's just something that he's still dealing with me on here and then I got into the room and trying to settle down and everything and and I'm ironing my pants and this certain thing came on my heart so I pray it's the will of God um and I pray it'd be a blessing to you okay um so as a topic um I'm I'm bringing it from James um and the Bible actually says uh in James chap 3:2 for in many things we offend all it says if any man offend not in word it says the same as a is a what it says a perfect man so as a title I want to deal with a perfect man amen a perfect man um what I've come to realize and I know brother Jesse deals with this as well as you all um the word of God can sometimes you know it can seem complex right but that's only without an understanding anything you don't understand can sometimes be confusing or like I said seem complex but once understanding comes you like oh wow you know so um I pray that tonight God impart understanding of these things because they're very important right okay so when our opening scriptures just right off you see that God is dealing with through James he's dealing with the church on how they talk all right so this is very important to God obviously right and the number one thing I want to say from this point is uh your speech it comes from a source yes sir the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks right so it it it matters the source of what you're saying it means a lot amen amen right and and it's I mean and and we really need God Saints because words can be very deceiving you know uh people can mean you wrong they can mean you harm but their words won't it won't indicate that right but they could just be buttering you up you know as they say to come in and and kind of work the work that they really have in their hearts and Jesus you know he he was dealing with those in his day when he was walking on the earth you know and he said he asked him a question you know and it seemed like he was a little baffled by it but in him being God he already knew what was going on but he just kind of posed a question to them and he says how can you being evil speak good things you know he just put that out there for them to think about it you know you know us in your heart you know how you really are but yet you coming to me as though you got some kind of a respect for me and you don't have no respect for me you don't even like me yes you trying to entangle me in my speech but you coming to me and calling me your master yes sir you know so words can be very deceiving so we need God right like young people old people yes I think I'm the oldest one in here yeah you know but we need God because we it's not humanly possible for you and I to be able to navigate in this life victoriously and successfully without God helping us to be able to identify those traps and snares of the enemy sir right see the enemy don't want us to be a perfect man or a woman right he wants us to fly loose at the lips if I can say it like that you know what I mean amen he wants us to uh and and and and I know you experience this too Satan always trying to get us to react in a spur of a moment he spring things on us and he wants you to hurry up and react hurry up and say something praise God Amen but the Bible says let every man and woman be slow to speak amen amen now I have to bring this in at this point because I don't want nobody to be discouraged so much so right but this right here is talking about another level it's not talking about just you know as a a natural man and a natural woman with a natural mind listen that's not converted yet and I want to I want to maybe I need to rephrase that it doesn't matter if you're converted or not converted cuz even if you are converted how many realize you can still walk in the flesh yes sir yes sir Glory the these are Needful Things Saints for us to understand because what happens is you can actually slip up you can allow you can allow an evil spirit to anoint you to bring you down into a carnal frame of mind isn't that right and then you react or you respond or whatever and then the devil leave you hanging out there and in that time what begins to happen you begin to get discouraged amen and then he comes in with his gospel and begin to tell you that you know you ain't got no experience with God right but that's not so Hallelujah you understand the Bible says walk in the spirit and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh but as we're growing as we're going through the process we will make mistakes but don't wallow in it don't stay that a Bible a righteous man he falls many times seven but he gets back up again see the devil want us to get all dirty and wallow around you know in our good church clothes and stuff like that you want us just wallow all in it you know just keep you down in the dumps in your mind amen amen you know he he has a level of success with that people in the church today are bound by past mistakes that they made that the devil in them in their minds he arises that thing in their memory and he wants them to lay down in that memory and don't rise from that place so that they they lose all hope but the blood of Jesus Christ you understand what I'm saying it already took care of all of that all we got to do is confess amen and repent amen now listen now brother Brandon said when God already done forgave you once you once you come clean now the Lord will convict your heart if you wrong he ain't gonna let us we're we're his children he ain't going to let us get past that cuz he's calling us to a higher calling right so he'll convict you when you're wrong right but he also he once you once you come his provided way you're forgiven right you're forgiv but brother brandom said you got to receive it by faith just like you receive salvation he said you got to actually receive your forgiv meaning you got to accept it by faith so if the enemy is trying to hold you or has been successfully holding you in one way or another for something that you did wrong and you may have actually been guilty if you've confessed that made that right now accept your forgiveness by faith [Applause] so now on that note what we're talking about right now it it's not humanly possible it's not humanly possible for either one of us within ourselves to be this perfect man the Bible talks about that's right can we say praise the Lord the Lord sir I want to deal with this right here if you don't let me read this right here brother brandom says in the message called Look Away to Jesus this is just an encouragement to you he says well he says when I seen that he says I run in I'm sorry no that's not what I want here it is this is speak to this mountain he says don't you fear Church of so even though we're dealing with this tonight no doubt it's going to it it may right it may deal with your heart very stronger I don't know right but whom the Lord loves he chastens them sir he he he's raising he's raising children to be mature spiritual Sons and Daughters of God right so brother brandom says this and speak to this mountain he says don't you fear Church of God I know you got a lot of Scruples among you he says you've got a lot of ups and upsets and downs sets and everything else he said but still you are the Church of the Living God by the grace of God you are he says no matter what you've done or how or how you done God forgive you of your sins he said listen now he says he wants a consecration so this is to encourage us to a more consecrated walk whenever God allows us to see ourselves whenever God permits us to have situations arise in our lives and we find ourselves failing that's just opportunity for growth God is showing us ourself to show us where we need to grow at right he's not showing us those he's not allowing those things to arise and you react wrong or think wrong or whatever just to beat you down just to make you feel bad right but he allows those things to surface because that's what he wants to deal with you on to help you to grow in that [Applause] area so God wants us to grow in our miles tonight praise God okay so I want to I want to go to this scripture real quick if you don't mind um let's go to Luke chapter nine let's go to Luke chapter 9 I want to start at verse 51 Luke 9:51 it says and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem and sent Messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the Samar notice it says of the Samaritans to make ready for him verse 53 says and they did not receive him the Samaritans didn't it says because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem J so now they had religious differences right remember when he went to the woman at the well she says now the Jews don't have no dealing with Samaritans why are you talking to me right so they had issues between the groups right so when it looked like he was going to go to Jerusalem and the Samaritans saw amen that the servants have come in trying to make ready for him to come into that area to that Village they refused him we don't want him to come because he's going to fellowship with this group over here and we don't want nothing to do with that group and if he's a part of that group if he'll go to that group we don't want nothing to do with his ministry glory denomination of walls amen it brings division you understand but notice this now notice how it says in the in these next few verses here it says they didn't receive him verse 53 verse 54 says and when his disciple James and John saw this they said Lord wil thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did now that seems noteworthy right they're going back to a scriptural example and they're trying to they want to be like the prophet right but they were in a wrong Spirit the Bible says Jesus turned around and rebuked them and said you don't know what Spirit you are of now we just read in the Book of James where it says the tongue is set on fire of hell even though the word was with them the word was not in them yet so that character and that Temperance that they needed Amen to be able to respond correctly to the situ listen Christ was the one that was being refused and look at how he responded you understand what I'm saying he's God and what I'm saying tonight Saints is the only way you and I can actually as as the Bible says be a perfect man or a perfect woman is when the holy God is on the inside of us having the preeminence unless God is there and has the level of control he desires to have we will fail we will find ourselves having wrong responses having wrong thoughts amen allowing the Devil to anoint us to speak things in a wrong Spirit yes sir wow so they had an evil spirit that slipped in and they thought they were standing for the word but they were actually doing damage how much of that is going on around the message right now glory to God saying all the right things you understand what I'm saying saying what the prophet said right but in a wrong Spirit they haven't allowed God to gain control yet in that area of their lives to bring about listen now a god-given temperance and it shows it reflects itself mishandling people criticizing you understand what I'm saying using the word to bludging people's Spirits now that will not that that that does not say at all see now we we that's what I'm saying we need God right because we need proper discernment yes cuz it's not at all that God won't come and talk a little course to his bride when he sees the need for it and I'm going to give you an example of that God will come right down and he'll chasen that bride through his ministry but if you're not spiritual you will take the whole situation in a carnal manner glory and the enemy will take your thoughts and cause him to run South that's what that region is it's down it ain't up it's down isn't that right that's exactly what happened and now you got people having all kind of an offenses and things of that nature CU they can't the Bible oh my now this fresh now I ain't I ain't this nothing amen the Bible says if you can't receive chastisement it says you are bastards and you are not his children huh glory to God Amen so his children have a characteristic built on the inside of them where they're able to submit and humble themselves to the word of God and even if the initial response might be a little too strong or might be out of the way because they are the children of God it'll be brought into track Heen God won't let it stay that way and because they are a child of God brother brandom said that's when I the are dealing with us right amen the word of God he liken it to a woman that has a child and that baby and that mother that growing baby a mean it has certain needs right so it might need iron right so if it needs iron and I know our sister you know a whole lot more about these things than me to my sister Smith there well that baby needs iron right that baby can't talk to the mom and say I need iron but the body is calling for it and because that body is connected to her on the inside of her you know what I'm saying am me all of a sudden it comes to her mind honey I want some liver I want some fried liver I just got and and and and she don't want a little bit of it cuz now she got a craving huh she want to get a whole pack of it amen fry it all up so I can eat it all up because something is calling for this iron on the inside and that husband when he sees the desire of that wife he'll go right out and go get the art deliver she want to satisfy that taste to satisfy that need and brother brandham says when God sees the need that his bride has he said he'll get a minister bring him to the pull pit and Supply to that bride with your theophany is calling for Spiritual vitamins amen topnotch amen uh Entre prepare by the hand of God to give to his bride that she might feed on the things of God that she might grow amen growing up into a perfect man glory to God the stature of the fullness of God by the power of the Holy Ghost so with a convert with an unconverted nature these men was able to be listen oh my you know how that that Spirit just slipped in so quick just in that moment that Spirit anointed them had them thinking they were standing for the right things and had that come out of their mou shall we call down fire to come down upon them Christ said you don't know what Spirit you ow that's right that wasn't the expression of a perfect man one thing I realized that I was considering these things the Lord allows things to come into you and our life Our Lives the Lord allows misunderstandings and arguments to actually come about in a home of a family for the purpose of growth he allows you to be tried in the very area that he wants you to grow in so notice this let's bring it down a little further First Peter chapter 2 starting at verse 21 this is how see in order to be a perfect man the perfect one has to be inside of you and all he's going to do is just live his life through you as we yield as as we submit now he has to train us he has to he has to teach us how to yield he has to bring us to a yield cuz we ain't used to that we used to we're used to living Our Lives according to whatever we've been we we become accustomed to for all the years we've been on this Earth for whatever age you are amen and the Holy Ghost is trying to establish amen this new creation these new ways amen within a vessel that's not that they're not they're not used to this I want to say this right now while it's on my mind you can have a human Temperance and you can become confused by that you can say well brother I do pretty good holding my tongue you know and you got to try real you you fighting or you got to try real hard cuz if something catch you the wrong way unexpectedly you ain't going to have your guard up like you going to be able to Be watchful like that it's got to be something that's a part of who you are if it's on The Human Side listen it will fail time and time and time and time again so that you know it's on the human side but when it's established by God when it's been quickened on the inside of you by the spirit of God himself I'm going read to you a few examples here I said second p Peter let's go there it says for even here unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps it says who did no sin neither was G found in his mouth notice what it says in verse 23 it says who when he was reviled revil not again that word revile it means to criticize in a in an abusive or angrily insulting manner it says to say unpleasant things to or about someone amen so it says when he was reviled he did what Saints he reviled not again amen he's our example amen when when people are being mean to you listening to the Lord will allow people to be mean to you why he wants you to grow in your mouth he wants you to grow in that way amen he wants you to be able to sit there hear the insulting uh manner in which somebody is dealing with you totally unmar amen he want he wants to allow you to be tried in that way he knows you will fail in the beginning but he knows you'll grow from that point and he's going to let that same test come right right back around but listen when God really got a hold of you you become so unconscious you you you're not having to try to remember the answers to the test but the Bible say be slow to speak be slow to speak be slow to don't get upset don't get up you ain't gonna be none of that glory amen it's just going to be a natural response amen and then then and then listen you will do it unconsciously and the next thing you know God will come down and have fellowship with you and he'll say you see how you passed that test glory to God and then you'll look back you'll say oh Lord that is right amen Lord I've grown I I'm not the person I used to be no more Lord amen and that's exactly right it'll be a time of rejoicing to see that the devil ain't got the power over you that he used to have G glory to God god notice this Saints now these are people with the Holy Ghost here let's go to First Corinthians chapter 4 I like this everybody all right I'm having a good time now I know I know that that ain't always a good sign to Saints when ministers having a good time because that mean he he can just go and go and go and go amen we ain't going to keep you long tonight praise God but I am having a good time you know what it's a wonderful spirit amen this is a testimony of the work of God that's taking place among you Saints yes it is yes it is man Glory all right where we at what did I say I said where 1 Corinthians chapter 4 starting at verse 10 it says we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ he says we are weak he said now this is the ministry speak now he says but ye are strong he says ye are honorable and we are despised normally God uses his ministry to Pioneer Works in certain areas like he's anointed brother Jesse to work in this area and he's been pioneering it's God the one that's anointing him to do it but he's reaching out in the area trying to find people amen that that that are heed the call of the Holy Ghost trying to find elect seed amen but in doing so and in having to express what his beliefs are and what have you amen it causes amen it causes offense to be taken people that have never heard this manner of Doctrine before amen they they they they they kind of take it in the wrong way and they begin to slander and they begin to bring about all kinds of of unfavorable things that a man don't want to deal with but he's doing it for the sake of the people you understand what I'm saying so Paul is saying we're being defamed but you're being honored you know we're having to push this work forward and we're having to suffer the scars and the battles that come along from the that come from that enemy's realm that's trying to hinder the work of God from going forth because it knows we have light and it don't want nobody to be able to hear this light amen because he understands it'll bring about a change so they fight us and they they they take us through all kinds of stuff but because we understand our purpose and who we are amen now with with the anointing of the Holy Ghost he said we suffer this gladly notice what he comes on down and says here Saints talking about a perfect man now verse 11 even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain Dwelling Place he says and labor verse 12 working with our our own hands he says being reviled now the Bible says Christ was our example now we see in Christ's life according to what we just read in First Peter he was reviled and he reviled not again so now you see a man that's full of the Holy Ghost right and without him having to memorize a scripture or trying to replay something in his mind he's naturally living out because it's not him Paul said it's not me that liveth he said but it's Christ that liveth in me you understand what I'm saying amen and so Paul down is saying here being reviled in return We blessed we don't let amen the strong speech that's coming from people that's intended to hurt us bring us into a carnal frame of mind that we lash back out at them again amen but there's a power that's residing on the inside of us that enables us to hold our peace amen and whereas it looks like the situation might Merit us to lash back out we don't what we do in turn is we bless somebody giving you down in the country huh amen and you sitting there wondering what's wrong with this person amen what is it God is allowing you to be tested glory to God Amen to see if you've grown to the point to where when you revived you are blessed they telling you off as hard as they can and then you turn around and say God bless you sir God bless you man said what you say you heaping like hot coals on their head amen am man they don't know what to do with that amen and the devil don't know what to do with that because now you ain't playing into his field Yes Man praise the Lord Mark chapter 7 I'm G try to bring this down to a close Mark chapter 7 starting at verse 14 amen it says and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand Mark 7 I inan verse 15 now it says there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man amen it says if any man have ears to hear let him here and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable and he said unto them are ye all are ye so without understanding also do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from from without entereth into the man it cannot defile him everybody read that right praise God so it's okay to eat some sweet sometimes praise the Lord it says verse 21 for for from within out of the heart of men proceede evil what thoughts adulteries fornications murders and that's dependent upon the spirit that's residing the spirit that's dominating that's what causes certain issues to come out of that heart yes sir amen the lust of whatever spirit is anointing a person it begins to issue out from that person's heart amen it's lust it's desires what it's feeling that person's with what it's feeling that person's mind with and that translates down into actions and things of that nature right sir verse 22 thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness it says and an evil eye blasphemy Pride foolishness it says all these things all these evil things come from within it says and that's what defiles a man now what caught me was the word the meaning of the word defile the meaning of the word defile it means this Saints it means to make unclean or impure it says to corrupt the Purity or Perfection it also means to debase now debase is the one that really caught me right so I need to understand what debase mean and when I looked up debase I was like Lord look at this and we're going to hit a few things here to let you know how important amen us having this this quality and this characteristic of God living in our lives is the word debase it means to lower in status esteem quality or character I believe there's a scripture that says answer not a fool according to his folly L you be like him right that devil want to take you from where you are and he want to pull you down he want to pull your the amen he want to pull your testimony down he want to pull your life down that's why Paul said let us lay aside every what wait and the sin which does so easily beset us those Devils hang weights on us things that hinder us when you got weights on you how fast can you run you can't run too Swift right you weighed down you getting heavy amen you getting bogged down in your spirit yes sir when you coming to church you hearing the right things or whatever but because you allowing the Devil to hang his ornaments on your life glory to God in your mind you can't go you you you can't enter into a real Victory so now you got to go and pray and ask the Lord to show you how is this happening where where am I allowing this to come in at Lord so he can show it up and give you strength to be able to go resist that devil and close that door lock itall praise the Lord Saints yes sir I don't want to allow the enemy to debase me amen this can't be achieved outside of a consecrated walk the level of importance that reading your Bible and praying hes in your life it seems so simple but why the devil fight so hard with those two things because it creates the right atmosphere it gets your mind on the right thing and when your mind is on the right things when wrong things come up hey man it's almost like you you know you be some place you be so far in in God's world you don't even really know what's going on somebody can be and it it done happen to me before I ain't I ain't nobody I ain't putting myself on no pedestal but somebody got upset with me I'm driving and I don't even know I did anything wrong and somebody just going off on me and I'm hearing horns and whatever but I'm just listening to the message I'm oblivious then all of a sudden I see somebody Zoom I did they zoom up beside me and cut I like what's wrong with that person I ain't even know they was upset I ain't know I did nothing wrong but am man you can get so lost in the things of God until the devil can't even brother B say he can't even find you to be able to draw you down into a cornal frame of mind that's the importance of reading our Bible and praying Saints it sets the right tone in our Spirits yes that ain't nothing but the truth yes you go and you done experience it you go time without praying and reading your Bible like you supposed you let those things get off and see how e listen you talking about a and I I want to say this I ain't adding to the Bible now all right yes but in order for your tongue to be set on fire of Hell the thought had to first come so that mean your mind is set on fire of hell and some people get real good at not letting stuff come out of their mouth but they saying the whole scope of everything in their minds yes sir yes sir and I just want you to know that that's unacceptable amen God want you to experience erence the real power of the Holy Ghost Amen to really clean your mind out clean your spirit up fill your soul with his spirit so that you can have the same testimony that Paul had Paul said the Holy Ghost God himself is working in me mightily that you understand that's the place that we're growing up to Saints to where there is a greater reflection of the Holy God on the inside of you and I can we say praise the Lord the Lord and just to help you with that thought part just so you understand now cuz some people feel safe when they think it and don't say it I want to take you out of your safety zone the Bible says in Proverbs 24 verse 9 everybody turn that with me or you oh you projecting as I'm oh okay praise the Lord good y'all read this for me well y'all read I want y'all to read what it say so just the thought of it in the sight of God is sin don't get scared though let's go and pray more say Lord I Ain know this was here now you telling me that even if I think it so Lord I ain't safe in my thoughts or in my spirit Lord help me to get all together right okay coming down to a close I got many more areas here I could cover but I want to leave you with a few things here by the grace of God this message here is statue of a perfect man brother brandham says Temperance does it mean stop drinking alcohol here he says either he he's referring to the scripture there he says no no Temperance does it mean alcoholic cure he says not in this case he says this is Bible Temperance he says holy spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh talking about the alcoholic part that's just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance he says that means how to control your tongue he says no matter he says listen not not be a Tattler spreading gossip praise God spreading rumors having an issue with somebody and quickly going and talking to somebody else about it versus talking to God about it amen and I'm saying it's very care we need to be very careful in those areas because how many realize because we're human we can misunderstand things we can misinterpret things so again the Bible says be slow to speak slow to R quick to listen hold up don't be so sharp don't be so fast with what you want to say even what you what you allow yourself to think go and pray about it allow God to give you clarity then you might find it ain't even no it wasn't even no issue at all I was wrong I misunderstood that praise the Lord watch what he goes on to say Saints how do you control your tongue not be a Tattler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you he says Oh my he says listen to this Saints this this right here is a vital part of the further part of your growth understand that he says boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we he says see then we wonder why listen to this now then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles and things that they used to do so because of LA ATT in the temperance which is holy ghost controlled in the soul of a man or a woman Amen to help them to have a a proper speech a proper response in thought and in word amen as a result of that being lacking in the church he said it hinders the moving of the Holy Ghost amongst the people he says add these things add Temperance to it oh Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoken to you scripturally we saw where they said in being reviled they said we blessed that was a testimony of the life that they entered into with Jesus Christ himself it wasn't just a religion you understand it wasn't just an intellectual knowledge but it was a life amen and that same Holy Ghost echoing these things through his Prophet right here praise God he says don't jump out and roll up your sleeves now see not that but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way he says you want to be he says when you're riled upon R not back let him be your example he says when you got the right kind of temperance like he had he says it'll vulcanize he says if you have it he says just a manmade halfway soued up belief of temperance he says oh I ought to slap him down I done heard people I done heard people around the mess huh they still a work in progress right and it shows cuz they talk about putting religion down and picking it back up again and what have you whe you you don't know what Spirit you are huh right now your tongue ain't anointed by the right place the right Source amen I ought to slap him down but maybe I better not listen this real talk now I ought to slap him down but maybe I better not cuz they might put my my name in the paper about it huh that devil trying to come in and anoint to bring about actions that he want to see come to pass Amen to see his lust carried out he says that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about he says don't try to add that he says it won't work but when you can really with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man and hold your peace you ain't always got to respond somebody could be dead wrong and the Holy Spirit anoints you the Bible say says as a sheep before her shearers was Dum it says he opened not his mouth totally innocent no wrongdoing but he knew it was the will of God and he was subjecting himself to what the word was calling for concerning what his life was to display but when that same person is on the inside of you and I you know what it'll do it'll have us hold our speech yes sir yes sir can we say praise the Lord everybody okay now you know I got to show you the scripture praise God oh my where we at here it is Psalms 39 verse1 Psalms 39 verse1 it says to the chief musician even to judian a Psalm of David Psalms 39 verse1 he says I and this is David now listen a man without the Holy Ghost but the anointing of the Holy Ghost was upon his life I said I will take heed to my ways notice this now that I do what that I sin not with my tongue David listen when you living in that place with God when you reading your Bible when you praying right when you having a daily walk with God God brings you conscious you understand what I'm saying God brings you conscious of things amen because David had this daily walk with God this is the effects of the Holy Ghost in his life amen he said I want to be so mindful of you Lord that I that I don't want to sin with my tongue I don't want to say the wrong thing he was guarding his heart with all diligence for as much as he could in the state that he was in Hallelujah praise the Lord amen he says he goes on to say I will keep my mouth notice he was he David was pursuing the life of a perfect man even though he couldn't be perfect in that hour it was in his heart to be perfect amen he says here I will keep my mouth with a bridal while the wicked is before me he says I was Dum with silence he says I held my people peace even from good and my sorrows were stirred it wasn't that he wasn't affected by things that was going on around him but he had become so anointed by the spirit of God until God wasn't allowing him to react like a normal man would that's the ER that that's how you come into to be a per or to express a perfect man or a perfect woman yes sir yes sir it's when you give way you yield your yourself to a mighty God that's able to come on the inside brother brandom said you ain't even got to write to your own opinion can we say praise the Lord cuz God say I want you to love me with all of your thoughts all of your mind all of your heart all of your strength I want you to love me with all that mean you giving it over you're acknowledging me as being Lord and you allowing me to come down and control every facet of your life amen you know my way is a better way you've come to learn that now you don't trust yourself no more your heart is deceitful you've come to see that now and now you want a better way which you've come to understand it's my way so you're humbling yourself to me now allowing me to take my Throne inside of your soul that I might manifest myself I believe it was at the end of the sardian church age I've been all over the place I've been digging all into the church I just been having a good old spiritual Buffet man but at the end I believe it's a is of the sardes and church age there was there was tongues and interpretations that came forth praise God and God is was one part I honed in on God spoke about a person giving themselves over to him that he might glorify his name in his name in that person huh God want to glorify his person inside of earn vessels we are that people can we say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen Proverbs 1429 it says he that is slow to wrath is of a great understanding but he that is Hasty of spirit exalteth Folly I'm going to read that from the Amplified version that same verse chapter verse proverbs 14:29 he who is slow to anger has great understanding that means he's learned something from God Amen the Bible says the wrath of man it don't work the righteousness of God isn't that right Amplified again he who is slow to anger has great understanding and profits from his selfcontrol but he who is quick tempered exposes and exalts his own foolishness it says for all to see ain't that right a man that get up that get upet quick he just he he get the blurting out stuff and just like a beast huh I was that man yes sir I am what I am right now by the grace of God that's right and I ain't going to call myself a perfect man I'm going to let the Lord do that mean I want him to express it out of my life it's not important for me to call myself something no more I want God to testify I want him to show who I am through him living it in me and expressing it through me if somebody called me a Christian it's not going to be because I say I'm a Christian don't let them see that I'm a Christian let it be like the book of Acts yes all right I know I said I'mma close a few times forgive me Saints I'm having too good of a time man I'm I'm trying to stop I'm trying to stop now all right so many nuggets Lord have mercy okay so brother Brandon was told by God ahead of time about a trap that was set for him by Satan okay but that trap ended up being was a young man and a young woman listen that God permitted God permitted that young brother brother brother Jesse them deacons brother Brown said that deacons couldn't get them to stop if somebody getting unruly in the church service the Deacon supposed to go and just firmly encourag them huh somebody the preacher preaching and somebody in the Pew holling out all kind of stuff drowning them out the Deacon is supposed to go and firmly encourage the person to depart the sanctuary but because it was a test that God allowed to come God didn't allow the deacons to enter into that frame of mind cuz God intended for the whole thing to play out because it was a test for his prophet and I I want you to understand that I man it's so it was a test for his Prophet listen it was a test for his Prophet that was going to dictate his advancement to the further part of the ministry that God ordained for him amen amen so God told him it's a trap set for you the young couple came in doing everything yeah just carrying on the deacons say they couldn't get them to stop that didn't make sense so I said God had to keep them from doing that because God wanted the whole test to play out now brother brandom is preaching and he looks out and he sees the stirring trouble and it's drawing the attention of the people and he says hey young man don't do that if you want to if you want to deal with her like that go and get a hotel room or what have you but don't do that in the service of God he went on trying to preach and it went back out again they start getting worse and brother bradam warned him again and he said the man just outright laughed at him he says then he knew that that was the test and right when that happened all of a sudden a voice came in Saints listen to this and then when I was turned I said don't and something said to me say what you will talking about a perfect man talking about Godly Temperance it says say what you will and it'll be done I stood there Mr Mercy the tape boy and all of them standing brother Fred and many of them standing present and perspiration and just running from me something says say blindness it'll be blind say death talk about death and life is in the power of the tongue when those young kids came out those untrained kids that the prophet kind of said that they were possibly Pro probably you know following a wrong example from their parents and their mindset toward the prophet he's walking along there and those little kids come out making fun of the prophet and his you know missing hair and whatever you know and then all of a sudden the prophet just turned around and call for those Bears to come out and it killed I think it what 42 of the kids or something like that right so here it is God got his prophet in this situation and he says say death it'll be death you know what would have happened but the Holy Spirit warned him he says be careful what you say he says and they'll pack them out say what you will he says I couldn't speak I love this I couldn't move he says and it just left me left me with those options they disrupt in the service listen the devil wanted him to get caught up in the moment glory to God saints is't that how it happens the devil will caused a situation to be stirred no matter where you might be or whatever cuz he's always got his eye on you because you're the one that's amen subjecting yourself to the truth amen so if you find yourself you if somehow you begin to feel like w these things happening to me I want you to understand it's because you're special huh and the de and those demons see you special amen so they want to disrupt your world they want to keep you as frustrated as possible as stressed as possible feeling as unloved as possible amen they want to pour it all out to get you downright to discouraged cuz they want your mind to get so far away from God and to drown so much in your world of whatever it's trying to create in your mind yes sir huh yes that's exactly what's happening I I know it I'm telling you praise God all right he says I thought God what must I do now what I what I what I what I saw within this Saints is the Lord had gain the control in brother brandom's life this was Temperance on display yes sir I thought God what must I do I turned and he stood there and his face white now he he know something that happen now that spirit that was on him now he got scared huh he stopped all his foolishness amen cuz amen they that the presence of God was just magnified he said he was looking at me his face was white looking at me I thought what must I say then I turned and washed this Saints care carefully listen to this wording then I turned and looked like before I know what I had said I said I forgive you of your act who was that that was Christ in a yielded Son of God listen a yielded mature Son of God that has so surrendered his life to that one to his King to his Lord to his husband until he was able to control his thoughts which in turn enabled his speech to be controlled to where now it ain't being set on fire of hell but his tongue was set Ablaze from heaven amen that was the Holy Ghost saying out of that prophet's mouth I forgive you of your he said for I knew what I said it happened so fast yes amen isn't that how you want it that's how I wanted that's why God gave us this example to show us listen he was a sin born man that had many mistakes in his lives but amen but he was a Son of God that was able to go through the process of being chastised and dealt with and taught by God to bring him to this place of maturity Amen to where it was no more him now it was Christ stepping forth that's the real purpose of the prophet's Ministry is to show us the an example of how it really should be and must have been he says just the right thing to say he says it was God listen to this it was God trying a reaction on an action that's why the deacons couldn't do nothing with it God said no deacons don't you even think to go any further with apprehending them you let them sit right there cuz I want my Prophet I want to I want what I've instilled in him to come out and be put on display he said it was God trying do you understand I want you to going forward now I pray the Lord help you to become mindful when these attacks come to you that is God allowing a what did he say he said God Allowing God trying a reaction on an action he's letting a certain action come to you cuz he's trying your reaction may God make us mindful of each one of these times so that we can properly pass these tests glory to God he says that he said that night was it was revealed to me that I said the right thing I know it was all leading to something but what was it what what to do watch this you know you he said you know you have to watch with a Divine gift what you do with it remember what Moses did so I must have said the right thing I forgive you cuz Moses smoked the rock right he got he the people got on his nerves he said you bunch of rebels shall I fetch you water out of this rock huh SM it he was upset praise God Amen and God said now Moses what you just did you Sanctified yourself in the eyes of the people he said but you didn't glorify me and because you did this you look all around but you ain't going over into that Promised Land naturally speaking right all right but this is the point I want to get to Saints he says Jesus said you don't know what kind of a spirit you are he says the son of man came to save life I'm sorry where am I yeah yeah the son of man came to save life not to destroy it talking about John and James right he says them scriptures just kept pouring over all night I didn't sleep he says but that was a trap set that Satan would get me all worked up and then make me say the wrong thing he says but the Holy Spirit was there and told me beforehand to be careful what I said oh the goodness of God how it was he says just his Mercy he says be careful what you said and this is the point I'mma end on he says and from then on there was a relief come he says I be to notice the different things that I would speak out unconsciously he says not knowing what I said and it would happen that way I begin to speak about it and as you go on this message is called speak to this mountain as you go on down just a few paragraphs down he be to describe how God be to introduced the third pool to him so God let a trial that involved his reaction to an action to be the test that when he passed Advanced him on into the third pool Ministry can we say praise the Lord you see how important it is for our tongues to be controlled by the Holy Ghost you see what it's going to lead to that's necessary in order for us to move on into this further part oh my no wonder we get so many trials and these little testing things that rise up man I didn't had people handling me all kind of ways and you and I I'm like where is this coming from what did I do to this person I'm I'm caught off God I'm like man why they acting like that to what did I do and I'm trying to search myself saying what did I do what did I say and the Holy Spirit when I'm alone with him he just begins to minister to me and you know what he the Lord won't even let me defend myself said hold your peace so I'm sitting there quiet about a whole lot of things right now because the Lord and I I'm seeing it now so now my I'm I'm it makes it better when you see what is working when you see what it's producing when you see the area that is leading to so now I gladly hold my peace I ain't got to be heard I ain't even got to respond oh oh man I wanted to show you something here I'll stop right there I ain't gonna do that I'll stop right there amen but this is beautiful Saints amen we ain't trying to bring a well sounding word a well put together sermon that ain't what this is about this is about growth this is about no this is about the rapture you know but but but even even outside of the Rapture there are things that you and I have to come to express God's perfect will has to be expressed according to the purpose that he placed into our lives right so he's grooming us he's working with us he's massaging us he's he's dealing with us his tender hand of Mercy is hard sometimes amen as you're going through your change amen it's real change and some it can get downright difficult sometime you know we we in a Christian environment or whatever so we we know is we know better than just to say anything or whatever because the Bible even say be careful what you allow your heart to utter before the Lord just don't let it be rash right but we going through that and God is he's he's laying it down on you because you got a higher calling right and it can be tough sometimes right we have to die we have to give ourselves more to the things of God because our Victory is within that there is no way you're going to have Victory or pass these tests if you doing things halfway in your spiritual walk your failures will be you have a gazillion of them because it's not possible outside of you and Christ being in a community God bless you Saints I thank God for his grace and helping me to express this so I got a little relief right now but I ain't got complete relief because I got to preach tomorrow and Sunday so that pressure is on me so y'all pray for me this is important right you God's bride you ain't just come to hear any old thing be said some human thoughts we want to go home we want to be right with God we want to grow all those things so you
