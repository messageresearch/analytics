God's grace and mother you just take the basket around and you just bring it back up thank you sir let's go to 2nd Timothy here in our Bibles it's good to be with everybody in the house of Lord today 2nd Timothy chapter 2 we'll start at verse 11 of course it's special to have our visitors here Mike and Shirley let's give them around father he's God good to see them been too long brother sister it's been too long god bless you good to see you thank you buddy love you sir thank you second Timothy chapter 2 verse 11 I like to go back to this thought you know this week the Holy Spirit's been dealing with me about the word rightly dividing the word as I've been listening in different sermons and so I like to go to look at this scripture about rightly dividing the word and this is going to be part three in a series I started three years ago so I only preached two parts on it well I'll leave it there for a while and then as I noticed the scripture is coming to me this week I just seemed oh that's exactly the same thought so I didn't intend to make the wait between the parts this long but that's just sometimes how it happens so we like to look at verse 11 for there say Amen so I'll read verse 11 to 14 and then we'll will read 15 together it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him since important to die everyday right if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us my if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the years now let's read verse fifteen together ready one two three study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth now I'm going to keep reading myself or 16 but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness so with false doctrine you're always gonna see people falling away from holiness and they'll go towards more ungodliness verse 17 and their word will eat as death a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus now what were these two brothers famous for they're famous for preaching verse eighteen who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection has already passed the rapture already happened what do you mean the rapture the second coming Christ has already come back a second time that's what they were guilty of and overthrow the faith of some now like a verse so verse 19 now connects us to 16 with the ungodliness because nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord note them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity so false teachers will always lead people into iniquity and ungodliness but the word of truth will lead us in the holiness and righteousness to live a life that matches Christ amen my god is busting the rimas word you may be seated here praise the Lord so I just got a text from brother Aaron he's at he's watching online today so bless you brother Aaron I got your text sir may God be with you as you're live streaming so we like to look at this thought now I'm just going to hold these up so you're going to see them later I'm gonna look at the duygu lot a little bit today we're gonna preach on that a little bit on Bible versions and the book that I've flipped through up now I'm not read the whole book but I've flipped through this book it's called which version is the Bible and this is a man who supports the King James only and I mean this is such a deep study I only got through like maybe 15 pages you know but because it says so deep so I'm gonna be referencing these off and on throughout the message but I want to look at these thoughts here and bring it down to you as the Lord's been dealing with me on some of these things but let's let's I got some quotes here let's start with some scriptures or some some quotes about rightly dividing the word so we can see how brother Branham kind of mentioned rightly dividing now these first few quotes are going to be review and then I'll get into the the new and fresh ones from today but you probably don't remember that sermon three out or three years ago anyway do you I don't remember maybe when you see some of the pictures you might remember but I was I was blessed as I was going over the the scriptures in quotes to kind of review this as we build up to you know the concordance the duygu lot and Bible versions I just want to spend a little time on this and let me tell you church this is so important and let me tell you why I'm going to show you the quote later where brother Branham says the greatest services he ever had in his life were the seven seals he said they're greater than any other services he said because it wasn't healing of the body he said but was it was revelation of truth and so this idea of rightly dividing the word is that same idea you are revealing the truth to God's people and that's why whether someone gets healed physically or not here this morning we can have just as a sincere and holy we say experience with God because the same God that heals the body is the same one who wants to reveal truth to your spirit and if we're not born again once you give you eternal life and your soul day that a portion of his own life amen and that's why we never get discouraged you know denominations may have bigger revivals no doubt they have bigger conferences than we have right they have more testimonies than we have of you know miracles and things like that no doubt about because they have more people there but that doesn't mean they have the genuine truth of Almighty God it doesn't mean they have genuine godliness so let me give an example I hate to call names but you know Joel Osteen has the biggest church in America in Texas Houston Texas it's the largest Church and if you go on their website they have at the bottom at least I last time I was there they have testimonies of people being healed all the time but if you go listen to the pastor and his interviews he accepts all homosexuals and will not be says I will not preach against it and I would go to any homosexual wedding now Church just take a moment look at that you have all these people gather there with all kinds of miracles people being healed of this healed of that lupus and cancer all these things but yet they let the sin of homosexuality in the church now which one is Christ welcome which you're done the compare that church to our little church today they got to have four services you know to to meet all the millions of people or a thousand people that come in and the millions on livestream which churches Jesus gonna gather at the one who's rightly dividing the word of God because a word that is not rightly divided eats as tankers as gangrene and so see they get under the anointing of the music and they think about Jesus and and and the hot and the rain falls but guess what it falls here to you amen and so doing that at a time when it falls they reach blessing and they could say thank God for the rain thank God for the rain but their lives if they're the wrong seed they produced the wrong corrupt fruit but our lives when we get the rain it produces the real fruit of the Holy Spirit amen amen now we've been talking about speaking the word no brother Diggs preached two sermons on speak the arrival of the spoken word and we've been we've been saying how the greatest I'm sorry the way to get victory is by speaking the word and and I've been saying this you know I remember I came up after brother Diggs and I've come up after brother Keith and different ones when there's where everyone's saying speak the word that's true but we must speak the right word we must speak the word that God has given to us and brother Graham tells us when Jesus was here on earth he was God he was God in Christ reconciling where himself he never used any of his great gifts when he meant saying he said it's written man should not live by bread alone it's written thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God he defeated him that's it that know this sure Satan knows it too but you got to know rightly divide the word of God brother man did not speak squirrels until the Holy Spirit said speak what you want amen and so it is with us like we you know we have these five cancer patients but we can't speak their healing until the Holy Spirit tells us to speak their healing we can pray and ask for God to reveal it we can pray and ask for blessings and we got all these but we can't speak it until God says it's the say at the Lord and now this is where we get down to real Christian maturity right because Jesus you know Satan was quoting Psalm 19 about oh if you cast herself off the angels of God will bear you up he was quoting the word but Jesus had to rightly divide the word of God he had to choose the right word that thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and so searider dividing the word is showing important and so crew pinnacle and when I live our daily lives right we got to quote the word and that's how this is how we'll overcome is by quoting the word the member we had and thank God we have this promise Jesus said he told his disciples when you're brought before councils and and judges and lawyers he said don't meditate on what you will say for the spirit of your father will teach you what to say in that hour amen praise God now when I spoke the word when oh oh who said he spoke the word for his nephew to have the baby remember everybody spoke the word now I was so nervous there's a good anointing there but he had the word he spoke the word he said God heard your prayer you're gonna have a baby and they did and then I spoke the word you know when I prayed over my my co-worker that they're gonna have a baby and I spoke the word over my friend's dad that Simon went and prayed for that he was going to be completely well the way I look at that is that when we spoke that Jose and when you've spoken the word of God in your life what happened is that you got under the anointing of the Spirit of God and so for you to speak it it wasn't a big thing because it was God's anointing amen it wasn't you trying to work it up it was the Holy Spirit flowing through you just like God speaking through this microphone you know God you just got real close to God and God spoke and said you're gonna have a baby right or you're gonna the gods going to bring that man out of the hospital that's what happened you weren't afraid because you were walking in the spirit amen Jose wasn't afraid to say that although I was a little nervous because I wasn't he I was the one God was going to use at that moment so see now we see it the importance that this is how our overcome Satan is by speaking the word for that hour rightly dividing the word now so this helps us to understand why brother Aaron would say something like this where we need preachers to rightly divide the word every service he said to bring up faith in Christ there's ministers that's the most important thing of the day is a good god sent preacher I admire them and their gift is far beyond anything could be done into anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of God it's the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister now why would he say this church he'd say this because of what we read for our text hi may Gnaeus and this other man I forget his name now was preaching that the the raptures are come and the Bible said they overthrew the faith of some see the preachers got to know he's got to be anointed by the right spirit and give the true interpretation of God's Word which he got from a prophet and if God give me an interpretation the Prophet didn't say that interpretation if he's a man of God will line up and agree with everything that prophet said his mother haven't preached every verse in the Bible right he didn't preach out of every single book in the Bible so what you've got to do is get under the same anointing that those are owes on the Prophet which is the Holy Ghost and then if ministers get into that anointing then everything they preach will agree with everything the Prophet said then you're not adding to the word because you're just saying what the word already says you're just revealing more of the same relation see this is why it's the most important thing is because the minister is either going to give you a rightly divided word or it's going to be a cankered word or which means a gangrene and now the church the sad part is that they could have a gangrene word let's go back to the Joel Osteen Church for just an example they can have a gangrene word and yet still jump in praise and their spiritual lives are corrupted right because they love homosexuality that smoking is okay and I've heard him say over the pulpit himself on livestream it's okay to marry two and three and four times they say that's okay God gives you a new beginning God's not going to give you a new beginning that's outside his word amen that's a Satan beginning Amen that's that's a devilish beginning but I will only give you a new season a new anointing a new new revival he'll only give you a new season when it lines up with us were a man but that's their keyword new beginning and fresh anointing and all these things now they do get that when they're worshiping and things like that but when they go contrary when they teach contrary to the Word of God that's no longer the right anointing it's not the right beginning it's the beginning of the end amen right it's the beginning of end of their spiritual because that's what the Lord says to bring the wrongly interpreted word create spiritual disease and that's right but amen Isaiah could say their tables are full of vomit because you look at their worship leaders women in high heels showing off their cleavage you know short skirts on and painted up like a barn you know and saying that's holiness that's their holiness that's worldliness that's sexuality that's sin and list that's lust of the eyes and God's Word will not lead you to such a place amen now for salvation all depends do they know better or not that's what it all depends on because the Bible said where there's no word or the Bible says in the book of Hebrews where there was no law there's no transgression and brother and brother Jose he's a man again brother Jose that's why a man said there can be Catholics that can be saved because they didn't know better where there's no law there's no transgression right that's why brother Han said that that's why though Jesus will save you know people for doing those six things in the book of Matthew 25 you know feeding the poor risen the sick in the hospital you know visit them in prison because they didn't know better right because of ignorance that's why they can be saved you know even preached on the mother harlot on Wednesday nights just hammering away huh but there's some people in there that don't know better and God's going to have mercy on some of them but few there be that find it over thank God that we heard the voice saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and abominations and a worldliness and the lusts of our flesh in her eyes amen see that's why it's the most he's not worshiping preachers but is not trying to get you to worship a preacher but he's getting you to be thankful that God has four men and ignore them attain them and given you the same anointing to work in the truth of God amen that's what he's saying this not to exalt me or exalt any of the preacher no God will not share his glory with anyone but is to recognize the greatest thing you can have is the Holy Ghost save it and then their gift is to see you brother Mike unto the day of redemption and it will guide you into all the truth of God's Word a night all right so if we got that down that's a good start let me just hit a few more things before I get to the new things here I'm skipping ahead I know you don't remember this sermon I'm sure but remember there's three things about Rams that we must not do with the word and these three things cause spiritual gangrene to misinterpret the word you explain it incorrectly like with homosexuality or like with women and and and sexy clothes or men that Custance wear and commit adultery on their wives and things now misplace program said is to put in the wrong place and brother Adam said that's like Hebrews 13:8 where you say well Jesus isn't the same yesterday today and forever he used to do that but he doesn't do that anymore and then brother have said dislocate is the move out of position and the example he gives well he says what Jesus is not going to preach Moses's message or Moses not going to preach Noah's message because dislocated it see doesn't see there's three things you must not do and so high mania s' and let me read his name because I keep forgetting that guy's name philetus philetus they brought gangrene because it looks like it could be some of it could be a couple of these it's probably dislocated or misinterpret they put though they put the Millenial message in the wrong day amen see they said the rapture the resurrections past already and guess what you would you know which denominations do that the Catholics and Jehovah's Witnesses do that look it up I was looking up Jehovah's Witnesses doctrine this morning and I've read their articles today and I'm like man this looks like the millennium didn't know it - this morning they teach like everything's peace now that's and church we do have a lot of peace right in America but that's in America yeah a lot of countries don't have that but see they got so relaxed and their false doctor now they believe will get to a little bit Java's Witnesses believe that Christ came or the rapture took place in 1914 that's what they believe so anyways they believe we're in the Millennium so see and then the brother brand proves that the church age book to the Catholics believe that as well now they're having their millennium right now so see because they don't they don't teach a rapture Catholic Church does not teach the rapture they don't you know it so see they dislocated the word same thing I mean eosin philly philetus that they dislocated so it's kinda like they put they took this out and they put it somewhere else back here they dislocated it and of course you might you might even say this too they explain it incorrectly you might you might even say that now let me go down to this thought about philetus here just for us a moment now the Bible said we study to show ourselves approved unto God so see he's telling Timothy to do this so so this is what I do Keith him Randolph and brother Diggs and brother kam and brother Brooks other preachers we go and study and when we study gotta proves the word that we're going to preach himself because we're approved unto God that's why I study in prayer and fasting is so important before preaching because you go study and then God approves it ya go preach that son I'll say thank you Lord yes yes Father I'll go preach that well you know the devil say well some of the people don't wanna hear that well I got obey daddy devil say well that might drive some of the people out of church God says preach anyways son I don't want him here at your church you know or you know all the people don't need that in the whole and the Holy Spirit said yes they need to be healed they need to set free this doesn't fit your series but preach it anyway it's gonna set the people free yes so you first get approved unto God as you work in your studies it's work you're not ashamed of what you're preaching because you've rightly divided the word of truth see the Bible truths needed divided or cut accurately okay this was tight by animal sacrifice Testament sacrifices now all of them got cut but some of them did the burnt offering member the bread offering was never cut the burnt offering was brother Mike it was like Abraham I'm bringing my bait housing and all of it goes to you amen a burnt offering was total dedication I'm giving a far offering to God God gets all of it I'm not eating ever the priest nah this is all going to God amen amen hallelujah but some of those like the meal and the peace offering in the sin offering in the guilt offering some of those were cut and sometimes God got a piece the priest got a piece and you got a piece and that fits perfectly because sometimes we just if they're a burnt offering it's just I'm just laying on the altar God God all of this goes to you and other times you need the preachers faith did you go in with you something like to come lay hands on you lay hands on me brother you know huh sometimes you you know we need each other sometimes sometimes we leave here like Oh everybody got a piece of that sacrifice but other times this is just between God and me amen amen glory and that's when you lay yourself on the altar of God or you give some some offering to God and God alone receives all of it there's no connection anyone else that sacrifice is only unto God see now going back to this idea of divided God's truth are purposely scattered hid in the Bible God purposely does that to hide himself from the wise and prudent now that's what Jesus and Jesus thank God he this is the one time he rejoiced he's the man of sorrows but this is one time he rejoiced thank you Lord that you hid the truth all through the Bible now that's strange to us but that's what Jesus said thank you Lord that you hid it from these people that really don't want it came in and the Bible says the glory of God to conceal a thing it's a glorious thing to do for God to hide it like that God likes to play hide and seek he likes to play hide and seek but it's the honor so see this gives when God hides it it gives you an chance to be honored because he'll say come find me if you really love me come find you you really no fellowship with me it's an imitation so this gives God a way that he can honor you and I more than like let's say a megachurch because we've gone beyond the service level of God's Word and we prayed more we've sought God more but it's God we're also this is God leading us through his leadership it's God inviting us into a deeper world it holds me do is say okay men so there's really no glory for us because all we did was just obey what he said whereas everyone else turns it down and they think you can understand the things of God on a surface level now some people will like the thief on the cross all she had was a surface level understanding of Jesus but he knew Jesus was innocent but God still saved him because he judged the word right he saw himself as a sinner and he saw Christ as the Savior and God saved him amen remember he that answers a matter before he hears it it's folly and shame and how many people go to the Joel's megachurch and you know they have their preachers outside they're trying to get people to wake up to some of those things and how many of them really how many answer that matter before they hear it and don't get me wrong I don't I don't believe it's right you know to to hound preachers and to stand outside churches and and pick it and I'm not saying that but I'm just saying like when when it issue is brought to your attention do you consider it or do you cast it aside and all you should do what God leads you to do on it okay now dividing means to cut straight that's what it means in the Greek if I'm rightly dividing the word I'm cutting it straight it's a straight cut and it proceeds to straight pass it holds a straight course it's doing right to make straight and smooth to hand alright to teach the truth directly and correctly so when someone's rightly dividing the word brother Mike they're saying what precisely is the truth yes it's not father son only goes baptism is okay sometimes or it's okay to sprinkle something no it's always wrong the only right way is full immersion pronouncing the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's just an easy example that we can all agree on and we can all say amen to that right because there's a lot of things we might not agree on all the way now here's the scripture about Jaime Gnaeus and philetus now I'm gonna skip to cankering because look when people start preaching false doctrine like I said it leads to iniquity which is doing wrong even though you know what's right and the ungodliness remember godliness is being reverent like God perhaps of godliness is being like God that means reverent and loyal faithful devoted and so they start losing some of the loyalty to the word and they start doing things that normally they wouldn't do now here this is important so here's the meaning of kanker it's a gangrene a disease by which if any part of the body suffering from inflammation become so corrupted that unless the remedy be seasonally seasonably all times and seasons hey thank God for the times and seasons amen anyway that's how we preach them 23:00 tonight just so you know the evil continually spreads so see false doctrine will continually spread it may be slow but it will continually spread eventually it attacks other parts and it last eats away the bones the bones so the structure right bones are structured back your backbone or your structure and give an example I remember I'll just I'm gonna call another name today Joseph Coleman and the seven thunders movement remember that okay well I was watching this week on some of their I was like what is this guy preach his major thing was he said the seven thunders are the seven virtues of the status for men and brother BAM never said that now he'd put two quotes together where it makes it sound like that but it's not that and I was watching their services and as soon as he would say thunder those guys would jump up and everybody would be going you seen it right yeah he's seen he's been around long enough I wasn't there you know what it was happening I was watching a video from like 2002 it was and as soon as he says the word thunder people are jumping and shouting and all these young guys are jump up they're shouting but talk to brother have on carry on out in New York and they're in the same city as that church and that church was filled with adulterous divorces money laundering and when he died in 2012 there was predictions he was going to rise on the third day and it came out thus saith the Lord in the church and he didn't rise again so see because he preached the raw and I he might have had I don't know he might had some truth but that doctrine wasn't true but man said the seven thunders he said are the voices of the seven seals it's the revelations contained in the seven seals brother Graham didn't mention anything about the stats for a man in the seven seals okay so they got it wrong but it looked good at the beginning but by the end of it by the 2012 it had spread to where now there was all this evil and his son was arrested of on Karen told me his son was arrested for stealing all hundreds of thousands of dollars from the church and all kinds of things in jail it was all over the news I looked it up it was on it was on the internet I saw the articles on the internet you can look it up so see there's a real blessing among us when we see our lives mourn to godliness when we see holiness reading and not evil amen when we see people you know when their hunger for God grows amen when their devotion to God grows Oh we're seeing something else we're not seeing angry we're seeing the Living power of God amen we're seeing Holy Spirit grow amen we're seing that seed grow into something greater because you're born again the incorruptible see the Word of God and that will push out and bring forth the fruits of the Holy Spirit now church this is what's really striking when I was preparing gangrene only tax living things so that means people in Joseph's church or we can use even Joel scenes that means some of them had started out as Christians yes they had to bend because gangrene can't start on a dead thing it's got to be alive has to feed off of something so that means they started out they got saved right faith they got justified maybe virtue knowledge you know he started to started going up the highway but then at some point this gangrene set in right it can't live off something dead they had to have some anointing they had to have some type of and that proves like what brother have said Judas was genuinely saved he gently was confessing he generally thought he was going to be saved now let me say this it clear up to me this week too can a person lose their salvation if a person is predestinated the salvation they can never lose their salvation that's right so see the only way a person can lose your salvation is if God foreknew they were going to sell it out the Bible says cast it away the Bible says depart from the way but the person who's predestinated to eternal life amen a person who stays true to Christ can never lose his salvation amen because his name was written before the foundation of the world on the book of life and Jesus literally says I will blot your name right in the book of Revelation if you don't repent quickly so yes people can lose their salvation but it's because God for knew they were gonna forsake it anyway but you cannot lose it if you were ordained to it as many as we're Daniel I believed glory not cease of the teaching of false doctrines teachers I'm sorry if false teachers doesn't cut straight or clinched the nail it leaves something open at least something like I don't see quite understand and it reminds us of leaven 11 spreads and it corrupts the whole loaf so I think gangrene was very good choice by Paul to show to show how false doctrine works it works like 11 and it leavens the whole cause remember that was that who's that woman I hid those three measures in there she hid a father son Holy Ghost in there it has a Roman Catholic Church who was it and now look what they got look at their loaf now it's all 11 now I think I pretty much got the review so now I can move on here yeah so now boy get ready if you haven't heard this get ready here we go I'm just kidding I may say some things you know today that you've never heard before so bear with me bear with me I don't know because a lot of these things Church I didn't know till this week like specially with a die Glocke did you know this is a Jehovah's Witness book I'm gonna show it to you in a minute who published this brother Mike publishers read the W word their tract Society who published this show was witness so I didn't know that till this week now brother Brad mentions I think 29 27 times so I'm gonna go through this but I may say some things that might shock you a little bit but just love me okay pray for me I've studied myself approved unto God don't walk out stay here to the end of the sermon trust me I've been here 13 years I'm not gonna preach any false doctrine but here's a picture of you know they got to rightly divide the sacrifice it first had to be cut and just to give you an idea so this is what a minister has to do a minister has to go in the presence of God and and offer it and he's got to he's got to cut it the way God says cut it like with the guilt offering you had to cut this part goes to the priest this the God this to the you know the fat always went to God so we got to cut the fat out that's gonna go to God and then you know the man takes this well so it is with the word there are certain parts of this that it has to be cut in the right way I can't preach certain things like against a women can preach you know I can't say man you can marry three you can bring polygamy back in the church that's not cut right that part doesn't go with the Word of God okay although although you could cut that out brother Mike because Abraham did that right but you can't place it in our day amen Larry you cut it out and this locate it that's gonna be wrong it's gonna cause this you see so I reviewed those parts now I mentioned this a few weeks ago brother Aaron really enjoyed this that's why I was gonna show it again but he's not here but he's live streaming so brother hope your volumes up here Jesus first coming had to be rightly divided see because here's a Bible you know here's your Old Testament there's Old Testament these two shelves New Testament so you know before all this also had to look at was these two shelves how are we gonna know the Messiah well God hid it in all these books not every book right but he hid it like in Jonah he hid it where the three three days and three nights in the belly of the whale amen but most people to know that you had to be you had to be around the man of God for that day the one who was rightly dividing the word of God and then he would say I'm gonna give you a sign amen as Jonas was in the belly of the world three days and three nights so on the son of man be in the heart of the earth they met Laurie it had to be rightly cut out of here and no no see without a spiritual mind they say oh you're blaspheming you'reyou're applying that you're not dividing that the right way but he had signs that vindicated maybe had he had the signs of indicated amen he said I only dude I wish my father shows me amen and so there's God give us the signs not only a brother branham like with will willie Upshaw you know you have we have William Upshaw's tract where he wrote a poem about brother Branham and he got healed brother he was in his wheelchair for 66 years he went to brother Rams meeting my mom saw a vision he spoke it across the pole the the microphone and the man got up and he wrote a poem about it and took it around the world and then we have his voice at one of brother Graham's meetings in 1951 testifying about being healed and wanting to share his testimony of a pamphlet with Joseph Stalin and all the people are clapping you know they're rejoicing in other words God has infallibly proved that William Branham was his messenger amen and on top of that you put the word the seven seals the church ages all these things you put on and off of that you got a God called man but with Jesus he had all the signs plus he had the character amen now I just found this in a book years ago I saw a quotes Malachi you know what the Prophet said about Jesus you know John the Baptist coming Micah Isaiah Jeremiah Hosea Zechariah Isaiah now there's hundreds of scriptures that were referencing Christ but they had to be rightly divided so I just circled a few of them those right there so if you are going to recognize if you're living here before all this is written you had to just pull you just had to pull a few here pull there you know the the seat of the woman you know you had to pull Hosea you know talked about Christ Psalms his body won't see corruption brother amen you had to pull them all over the place it had to be cut and rightly divide the right way amen you just couldn't pick up one Birkin I'll pick up Nahum Neiderman say well another thing about the Messiah now and God doesn't expect you and I to memorize God didn't expect everyone to see all that what God expected was to see that God was with Jesus amen and that God anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and he went around doing good and did good for everybody healing the sick raised in the dead and preach the true God amen because God the bait has to be on the hook Christ so God uses right to attract the true believer right and then all those that you know we're real believers they Peter said where and where are we gonna go when he start preaching the hard things about you know my flesh is my flesh is your meat my blood is your drink and 70 preachers walk away he said he said well do you want to go to he said how can we go anywhere we know God's with you amen we don't understand where all this way but we know the words anointing you hey man that's what we know about brother brand the word was anointing him and now we can see the way the main thing you and I man oh yeah praise God it's anointing us to holiness it's anointing us to miracles when it's time for that it's anointing us for the gifts when it's time for that but the main thing it's anointing us for is living the life of Christ hey godly sinless lot if they met only life because number that says great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh and now he's trying to manifest in your flesh in your flesh in your flesh in you in my flesh that's what godliness is God manifesting through our flesh Amen Alleluia so I just circled a few but remember Jesus said the Bible said on the road to Emmaus he began at Moses and all the prophets in spite of them in all the Scriptures of things concerning himself so Jesus starts rightly dividing the word to them he pull a little bit out of Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers or what a sermon that must have been no I'm the preacher preachers he began to preach he said to them these are the words which I spoke unto you I was it with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms concerning me so all of that was in there so Jesus says there was a whole lot more that was just a real small sampling I just wanted to show people and then what I always say after that is that if Jesus first coming was like that brother Mike then you know the second coming he's gonna be an iPad too yeah but the beautiful part is now the beautiful part let me go back here the beautiful part now for the second coming is God compose scriptures although a man he can boast coaches from any book Old Testament New Testament and he can reveal how he's coming amen glory we know he's coming shout voice Trump but we don't know all the details behind that but I imagine there in the Word of God in types and shadows praise the Lord so we stay with the Holy Ghost he'll guide us into all that truth alright let me jump ahead back to where I was so the question is how far will we go for the truth because in at the feast of tabernacles Jesus cried out and he invited everybody to living waters just like we do we invite everybody we tried invite everybody we can I saw some Facebook post about having people repent that was really good sister I like that we argued on that book that more people this week I'm just trying to bite everybody you know some doubted and their excuse was that so what the Bible records their excuse was that well no prophet was going to come out of galley now church catch that they knew a prophet would come out of Bethlehem but they were never had the desire to ask Jesus personally if he ever lived in Bethlehem they say well we know he's going to come out of Bethlehem but he came out of Galilee like they didn't have the desire they didn't have the unction to even go ask him personally and sometimes that little fearful spirit falls on you and I we're we're scared to go I talked to some about a problem right we're just going to take what we know about a situation rather than go ask them about it and the church said everybody got quiet on that one because that's the truth it's easier just to assume and stay in your own little cocoon and and try to figure out what that verse is so it must be this that's that must be how they feel that must be what happened because I know this this but it's better to go ask somebody about it yes and that the one thing that's one thing they didn't do they just thought well I know he came out of Galilee so it can't be him and they failed to dig deeper they failed to dig a little deeper Church if you wanted to find some gold you're not gonna find it on the surface ha ha ha you gotta dig deep George ain't never like like job said Jones had god help us to find a vein of gold amen help us I find a deep place where there's lots of gold and where it's all kind of hidden under there let me dig until I find it amen people just don't hang around long enough they don't ask enough questions they're not as interested as they should be and God will hold him accountable for that because listen instead of devoting their time to Bible they go devote it for the sports games right they'll go devote it for drinking and getting drunk they go devoted to movies though devoted to family members right vacations they'll devote all of that time where they could be searching and seeking after God but instead they'll answer quickly they'll be a fool and they'll go off there and just try to have life and have fun all's they had to do was go ask Christ himself where were you born that's all they to do because remember the Shepherd's had already told everybody about it 33 years earlier they'd already brought the Bible so they broadcast it everywhere they went and Mary heard it but the difference was she kept it in her heart I remember what the preacher said I remember when they appreciate that one Sunday I remember that revelation I'm not going to lose that revelation I'm going to ask God God let me never forget that I don't want to be the same I want to believe what God's Word says I would believe what the Angels say I won't believe what God's prophet says I want to believe all the rising divided truth they meant Mary kept these things in her heart yes God reveal this to me this lines up with the word and no no doubt she could even look at I had Jesus in Bethlehem and Micah says I'm gonna have a baby in Bethlehem my life lines up with the word we can look at the same way Jesus said this Holy Ghost is to them that are in Judea and all them that are upon the face of the earth and it's for me honey Leah I wonder what that was for and the Lord's calling me amen even as many as the Lord our God shall call amen let's give this wealth sermon was I was studying I was talking about the concordance we were talking about the concordance a few weeks ago by the Amen this is kind of where it started it there's 11 times program talks about using a concordance I want you to catch this and we're get to the die got now just for a moment then we'll get back to the concordance now 1959 questioners answers service on the Holy Ghost now we got some very stiff questions here and we wanted to get right into them sometimes you guys bring me stiff questions usually there are text messages though there's stiff messages that's okay not really someone looked at all these books I had and I said well smart man only needs one so brother Ram Haddad I got a Bible and you've seen the concordance it's huge the concordance is like three of these Bibles so Bubba has walk in the tabernacle that morning he's got a concordance all these things they say well if you're a smart man you only need one book what a lie from the devil what a lie now for salvation you only need one book but if you're gonna answer a question and find scriptures that you know you know you don't have memorized you need some help he imagined me to properly God walking in church you got y'all yours your help and everything so a real man doesn't need an iPad oh really all the reside of my iPad is for a concordance and then to show you the scripture so you can see it with another sense not only hearing but seeing Church will have no excuse on the day of judgment you know generations they couldn't even see it like but we only get to see it we hear it too yes and me I mean I forget to touch it I don't taste it or you know smell it I can touch it I can see it and I can hear it we have no excuses there's a famine for the word of God this generation but let me tell you there's no famine here right now we're facing on God's holy word amen hallelujah we see it we hear we touch it we believe it amen he said I'm not a smart man she have to have a lot of them to look into well this is a dicot and this is a Bible and this is a concordance he were just going to ask the Lord to help us and direct us to answer these questions just according to his divine will and His Word so don't get upset if brother Jesse uses a concordance or you know I doubt I'll use ad I got but there might be one reason I use that I'll explain just a moment now let me explain the die guy here this may be kind of deep so I'm just warning you you might not remember this but just remember to stay with the King James okay can you remember that church now I'm not a bible thumping King James only all the time I'm not that yet well I'm getting closer all the time and here's the reason why because I go on these websites to see like the Bible version like ESV and I try to find what manuscripts did you use and they don't say I'm like so the only way to know or the only way to kind of know is to go to a website where they have all the versions and you can look up one Scripture and see it in all the versions which I use Bible gateway and search if I find one scripture from one version where it's missing part of that I'm never gonna reference that one again because jesus said if you take one word away or if you add one word the plagues are added to you or your names taken out of life now this gets real serious Church but listen I do believe people can be saved again I'm using this because it's scriptural where there's no law there's no transgression these people that don't know they don't know but behind it all behind all these Bible versions is money yes King James Version is is open to the public public domain but one of the reasons they do these new versions is they can sell to you make all kinds of money because we know the Bible is the most purchased book of all every year [Music] now with the die got no this is what I show brother Mike it's the original Greek of the New Testament okay but it's published I'm sorry but it's from the readings it's rendered from it's the translation from the Vatican manuscript from the Vatican Library Church this gets into some strange conspiracy theories here where did the Jehovah's Witnesses get their original scrolls from the Catholic Church and church it's right on there it's on the website you can go watch I'll show it to you if you want and remember we just appreciate brother how all the death of all the people would be port was responsible for that the mother harlot man I mean there's just some strange connections and I'm I'm usually not a conspiracy theorist but but I just think it's interesting and we know what the Word of God says and we know the word can't be wrong so in other words who is the inspiration behind the dyg lot the Roman Catholic Church now if you read brother his message to which we'll get to he never Labor's on he never makes us the absolute he uses as a witch it still may be used as a tool to some degree but I personally will explain why or when I'll use it as a tool so that this is this is this dyg lot english translation from the vatican scrolls the matter of human ship scrolls okay scrolls and another name for the vatican manuscript is codex Vaticanus and this was used by Westcott and Hort now Westcott and Hort were two scholars and in 1881 they put all these scrolls together and say these are the scrolls we need to use to make a new version of the Bible I'm just trying to very simplify it now there's two ways here's the true path to the King James Version and here's a corrupt path now the Westcott and Hort which is what this is from the Westcott and Hort 1881 that's where that vatican manuscript belonged to belong to them so Westcott and Hort took these scrolls the Vatican manuscript and they put him together and say we're using these now listen the ones they use were actually physically older than the other ones that they use so the paper itself was older but it was corrupted paper the words on the paper was corrupted so in that case it don't matter is what's older and matters what's right amen to see the code McKenna's was used by Westcott and Hort and they eventually produced the modern translations especially the NIV that's the big seller that's the big one so see the NIV the reason it's wrong it starts with the wrong path they start with the wrong Scrolls but the scrolls that we start with is called the Textus Receptus or the receive texts so the the Jawas witnesses found the vatican manuscript and they took that and they just did the New Testament now because there are Greek translations of the Old Testament just say no I know it's Hebrew but they do have translations from Hebrew to Greek so that's a little bit confusing so see but they they started with the wrong scrolls and so the dagger actually comes from the wrong scrolls they start with the wrong scrolls they interpreted in English it's the wrong scrolls now just so you know 7% of this of our texts our scrolls I say the holy scrolls 7% of the holy scrolls is taken out in the Westcott and Hort scrolls 7 Jeff Satan person 8 sit there's something like a hundred and forty thousand words in the New Testament in the the the right scrolls but the Westcott and Hort cuts off seven percent of that and if you take one word away and these and these guys the Westcott heart those guys were known to be immoral men too they lived all kinds of filthy lives you know sexual sins and all kinds and the very eyes cutting out and choosing the wrongs girls and it's okay to cut that out that's really those those words aren't on our older scrolls the very guys that we're doing that we're living gangrene lives now let me share this even though this William Tyndale a church was martyred at the stake in 1526 amen you can look this up online he was one of the main translators of the original manuscripts all the ancient copies he was one of the original translators and all these evil people during the Inquisition killed him and his last wish was Burton getting Bert his last prayer was God open the eyes of the king of England a man in other words a man have died to preserve the Bible that you and I believe today and it's even prophetic because the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy amen and a little less than a hundred years later King James saw the vision he said I need to make a Bible that we that's all the truth and that we all need to agree upon it he said we got all these different bishops Bible Geneva but we need a Bible in the common language of the people amen so the Holy Spirit married to that man and raised the Bible that we have today amen hallelujah see but we got the right scripts we have the right texts I'm sorry scrolls our Bible comes from the right Scrolls that's why we can rightly divide the word of truth that's why they're going to miss it every time almost every time is because they start with the wrong scrolls you know so so so see this came from Westcott and horts collection of paper Scrolls papyrus scrolls and they just copied it over and they have this now let me move on now the best example of this that I found and I looked this up myself through Bible Gateway is Isaiah 14:12 King James says how shall follow no heaven from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning now look look what he's called he's called son of the morning how art thou cut down from the ground which this week of the nation's now this was my favorite secondary Bible but I'm never going to use it again here's why because when they translate son of the morning say how are you falling from heaven Oh Daystar I'm never gonna use that one again because Peter caused Jesus the day stuck in 2nd Peter 1:19 yes now that can only be Satan because Satan wants to rob all the glory from Christ I will exalt my throne above the heaven I will be like the Most High so I will never reference the ESV again that was my favorite because I read online was somewhere it was a word-for-word translation but listen Church if it's a word-for-word translation and it's the wrong scripts it doesn't matter if you knew word for word or thought for thought it doesn't matter because you got the wrong text to begin with look what look what and I see NIV is so perverted how you fall forever the old Morningstar Jesus literally says I am the bright and morning star you can look it up go to Bible gateway type in Isaiah 14:12 I did this before I study myself approving the God and you can see that's what they do so let me say just plainly my our church if you're a vom your pastor stay with the King James I'm not a King James only thumper you know like you got a yeah I'm not I'm not all that but what I know it's the only version I'm gonna preach from and study from until I can find somebody that literally says this they're gonna say well Church we went back and we're using the same script Scrolls that Tyndale and Kover dale and you know and king james we're using the very Textus Receptus and i'll say praise a little hard yeah but then we're gonna watch and see if they take anything away I don't think that's gonna happen I think I think we'll be with King James rest of our lives maybe to the rapture so see Church that's why I'm preaching things I've never preached before because I feel like God has helped me to understand how to rightly divide the word of God and now when people tell me things I'm gonna say this like every year at Bible Club I always get asked you know there's children what what Bible versions are they saying I've said well I would try the ESV I'm never gonna say that again I'm gonna say I just only recommend the King James Version because it's from the right source scrolls the primary scrolls that comes from are the true ones and I can and then I say I'll say this I can show you where they take words away okay no the watchtower it's right here this this was published and I got it was published by the watchtower society and never said Jehovah's Witnesses can be saved yes they can just like Catholics just like Luther mint they can be saved right if they don't know better and they're not purposely walking iniquity and they're trying to live godly if they literally live a virgin life although foolish if they live a version life they can be saved but look what they believe I went on their website they believe in cessation this is the most dangerous one that's why I put it started they believe there's no more miracles they believe there's no more working of the Holy Ghost and when they do that many of them they crucify the Holy Ghost they they crucify Christ afresh and my wife has a good story they came to the door one time and my wife didn't know it but my wife let it talk to him my wife started talking about how my mother or my mother was here the cancer and the younger ones tell me about the other one got really excited oh praise God but the older ones like no that doesn't happen anymore and we're Charlie after that they left they don't believe that and that's really close to blasphemy that's really close to crucifying because if I stand with that guy and say the Holy Ghost did it and he say no the devil did it now he's just blasted in the Holy Ghost now he didn't say that but let's say he did say that now most of them are I just say well it was the doctors or like he said maybe your mother mother-in-law never had cancer to begin with so they won't blaspheme it but if they say the devil did that then yeah that would be blasphemy they and you can look it up they believe 1914 was the second coming they believe Michael is Christ but see brother Graham liked him a little bit because they denied the Trinity and I like that they got some good things going for him and they got some real bad things they got some gangrene and they also exalt the name of Jehovah above the Lord Jesus Christ right they say the name what's the name of God Jehovah well it's more net it's Lord Jesus Christ now Michaels Christ now there's once or twice after the seals brother Graham says Michaels Christ but let me show this I by the way I'm never labored on that brother branham never increased his sermon on that so here's what I'm saying if Michael's Christ which if God's fixing this way the right hand I guess Satan was the right-hand man to fellowship so I got this man I could have it mixed up it's not a major doctrine many ways whichever if Michael's Christ then who's the one speaking between the cherubims Michaels that Christ Christ is God are you a church Christ is God and the same thing is true when program says when Jesus broke the here's John seeing the four horse riders but remember Jesus was standing there with John breaking the book broke breaking the first seal and bro man said see the white horse rider can't be Jesus because Jesus is standing right here by John Amen yeah this is the first seal better and will tell you that Jesus is right here by John and Jesus just broke the seal and they're both looking up then there's the white horse rider rode go past God's not going to give two personages God's only one person so the same thing is true Michael can't be Christ because Christ is the one who's seated on the mercy seat hey that glory everybody catch that hope that's okay now let me go back here's why I'm not gonna use this unless now here's what the one reason I could use this by those a and brother Amen just somebody knows is there's notes in here from authors like and the one example is tears it gives a really good detail about the history of Tears in Judea and Palestine so that is really helpful but that's the only way I'll use it but this this leaves out first John 5:7 what's first John 5:7 there's three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost not the son that's why the Catholic Church is trying to get that out because it proved Jesus name is not son see and even it even show see the word the the word son is a title and so is the word word is the title but the name of the word is the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God are you with me to see this cuts out Scripture now there's an asterisk that says well some manuscripts have you know this this verse in it but they cut it out I remember the warning if you add one word or take one word away your name will be taken out now I'm trying to get down to cloves here I'm not gonna promise when I'm gonna close either I'll close at noon okay I gives me 24 more minutes now barrel there was 27 quotes on the diag lot and he does not emphasize them after the seals there's only three mentions nor in the church age book so churches that's like a tool his brother am believed Michael was Christ you know but he never major on it god never major done it to correct him on it because it's just a minor it's not a major right and so see it wasn't emphasized it was just a tool he would use it the main way he used it was with two verses blasphemous names because the you know Jesus said they'll be full blasphemous names but this says names of blasphemy so brother man was always see he said oh it's a great difference I don't know what the difference is but he says there's a great difference so this says names of ask me the Bible said blasphemous names either way Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Jehovah's Witness they're all blasphemous names anytime you say up trusting in the Catholic Way instead of the Christian Way you blaspheme the Christian name and the second one is jesus said greater works than these shall you do because I go to my father and John 14:12 but a man said they don't use greater here they use more and that would actually be a better translation because Bill Graham said you can't do any greater than Jesus listen Church the bride ain't gonna do greater miracles than Jesus just get that in your head right now you ain't you ain't gonna do greater miracles in Christ you can't he was God in flesh amen the fullness of the godhead dwell in christ bodily program says that over and over but some people I still heard people the message say even that camp meetings I heard him preach it some of the camp meetings I heard people say that would do greater works greater works than these show you do or do greater works than even Christ I heard people say they camp meeting over Internet you're not going to you can believe you can believe what everyone but that's not gonna happen now here's how you use the concordance he's preaching on the ten virgins under 44,000 he said we know what the seal of God is what does the seal of God he lists all the scriptures you just take the word seal in your concordance and run it everywhere you want to so let me open up my Bible so you have a Bible app if you have a search menu bar at the top you click that and you type in seal but they meant how many Bible verses have seal see the blue there 58 so look how easy it is for me now program had to get out a book and he had to open like a thousand two thousand pages and find where seal Susan oh now he found seal and they list all fifty eight times the word seals use in this big huge I remember when brother Craig used to carry it he would come into he would come into preaching with a duffel bag carrying all of his books he got that big concordance boot my brother I'm thinking I gotta carry one of those around thank God for technology but brother says if you're gonna teach on the of God he said get out the concordance and see what it says every time about the seal of God so what does the seal of God the Holy Ghost in other words you look if you wouldn't know about something you look at every time God said it and then if the Holy Spirit will anoint you to see the truth of that subject you'll see it and then you'll have the say that the Lord Amen hallelujah that's right and he goes preaching the seals look what he says the third seal he said o oil typifies spirit wine symbolizes stimulation of Revelation boy I'd like to run all over the place it's a wonder I didn't wake up the neighborhood when the Lord showed me that simulation of Revelation see all the line is in the Bible is associated together always so in order to understand the third seal about the oil line hurt not the oil one brother Brahim said I got the concordance and looked and there's a string of them like that where wine and oil goes together all the time and there's a screenshot I know it's small but thirty nine times in the Bible Deuteronomy 14 all the way to Revelation eighteen thirteen thirty nine times oil and wine run together praise God so if the third seal says touchdown that old online glory and Jesus is protecting the oil Lord and on the day of Pentecost they said we've got new line hahaha and there's a connection and I also fit together these cannot contradict each other they all have to say the same thing and in the old testament they were four shadows of the type of sacrifices God wants in other words God wants you to have the oil in your sacrifice I want you to have one your sacrifice that means you're going to get bored again and you gotta get stimulated by the revelation of God's Word amen and saying can't touch your name Satan cannot touch that Holy Ghost amen Lori thank there's a heart thank you Jesus now he's preaching the 4-cyl he said last night we find it the first seal went forth the right and the Lord so help me I never knew before none of those things have I ever known before that's right and I just go up there and take the Bible and sit down and there until when it grows to breaking forth like that I just pick up my pen and start writing and just stay there maybe four hours till it gets finished and if I've preached this before I'm not gonna preach this morning but every one of the seven seals brother man tells you sometime in that sermon when the Holy Ghost visited that day to give him the revelation now what a beautiful lesson that is for you and I if brother Mike if we'll just shut away every day with God and just wait on and just read the Bible and just wait pretty soon a revelation is gonna break forth we won't see a vision because we're not prophets like brother Branham now we may have a dream which could be like a vision you know if it gets interpreted later on but it teaches us we just gotta wait upon the Lord just wait there and pretty soon the Spirit will begin working and then it'll show us something in God's Word how many experience that I experienced it almost every day very force now he's same quote then I go back and I find out as I see where he said I thought well looks like I've seen that somewhere so brother ham sees a vision of horse riders and then after that vision ends he says I think I've seen that somewhere in the Bible I get my concordance go back is there something like that and here it is right here and then here it is over here see in the Bible and here over here and then I just tie ride it I know that's the devil no I know that's God as long as it's comparing Scripture of Scripture that's the way it has to do Amen just like putting a building together the stones have to fit stone by stone praise God oh don't you love a jerk hmm now side note the concordance is how I preach the statue of a man series and this is what brother Branham wanted to do one of those days but he never got to do it so for example virtues only use ten times in the Bible brother Branham only quoted this one that Verte I'm sorry these three that virtue Anna so in brother I'm preached virtue he only used these virtues about divine healing so if you listen to the stature of man and I heard brother Joseph Coleman preach this he said you don't have virtue until someone touches you and they get healed by touching you because they listen to it I can understand why he preached it because that's the only one brother Branham used in the sermon but there's other scriptures about virtue and member this has to be a virtue that every person can have man or woman but brother Branham first you know reason maybe they have enough time to study but he only preaches the vine healing virtue he doesn't preach the virtue of a virtuous who can find a virtuous woman oh not now everyone we can say amen to that but if I said everyone you women have to have somebody touch you and be healed and so you have to know weren't you flowed out of here and that's what Joseph Coleman preached I heard him say it on a video on YouTube and no wonder that gets the people I mean does that automatically make you feel like this see that was a case I'd be praying up say touch me brother might touch me you know let me know when you're sick somebody come touch me when you're sick I mean honestly right because I want to know I got what God wants me to the Bible said add it and I want God to add to me virtue but you see you see how let me say this you see how he's led of the Holy Spirit to go back to the concordance if I'm gonna preach a series I've got to go back to the concordance and see all that the Bible says about a topic and then in the Holies we're now to the true revelation because remember the scripture says not all have gifts of healing so that means not everybody is gonna have somebody lay their hands on them and they're gonna healed because not everybody has a gift of healing am I trying to correct brother BAM God knows I'm not but would brother Branham want us to go deeper in the word yes he would because the Holy Spirit's trying to take us deeper in the word and look what that just just by focusing on those three neglecting the rest look what it did in that seven thunders camp total division gangrene sin ungodliness all these things so I hope you understand church I hope you understand that we're just trying to balance just trying to rightly divide the word a virtue that everybody can have a faith everybody can have a knowledge everybody can have now look we're there it is in the Bible here it is notice at the end the message is paragraph 411 this is a three knife our sermon he said if I only had time to do it you can't do it in one day so man lets us know I didn't get all to it today you can't do this in one day that's why I preach I think 15 messages on it you know that but can tie the whole thing together amen see the stat for a man can be tied the whole can tie the whole Bible together because of all the sevens it's 7 it's 7 whenever you see 7 building is speaking of the church ages stats River man all these things 7 you could tie the whole thing together because it's a 7 he said see now this is before previously in the sermon paragraph 345 see what I mean see how these virtues these building materials type in with the church messages with the church ages now one of these days ours one of our days they that's what I believe we're gonna take each one of those words and study them out see and show that it proves it it all goes together now brother Mike I believe I haven't fulfilled that brother now you can call me crazy if you want but just let me be happy because because I did what brother Branham did when he when the seals came to him I just did a concordance search of all those scriptures and let the Holy Spirit reveal rightly divide what's the what's the what's the word for all of these what's the holy spirit truth for all these virtues it all goes together see how wonderful that is see to see what it does now I know I'm running them recently I know a lot of brothers that teach the adoption message rather than sanctification in other words a lot of brothers more than I thought preach that you got to get justify sanctified feel the Holy Ghost and then you start the statue perfect man not to me that's to me there that's wrong and I love that all of them but to me they're basing it on quotes rather than the word because they misunderstood some of the quotes now if that's true if they're right and I'm wrong then this suggests someone can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and still need faith and then you still need to be capped off with the Holy Ghost again but remember I said this before do a Bible search the Bible never says do a concordance search the Bible never says we're sealed twice there it is you're sealed until a man you're sealed until the day of your redemption they're not two seals there's one seal see so it has to be like it has to be that way because if not you add something to the word now see in church let me just say like this this is the gift God has given to me I can't I'm a teacher I'm a pastor I can't be something that I ain't why do these things come to me brother William I don't know but they come to me and what does it do it lies it rightly divides it it's perfect because the Holy Spirit it's not me I just sit back and let him come to me now I'm gonna try to close in 10 minutes yeah good it'll work huggy see brother and so you can have different convictions yet unity yes so but man this is in 63 question has drawn the seals he's doing questions he said he said I have higher answer wrong you forgive me if you have a different interpretation and believe that your idea is right just go right ahead that won't hurt now a lot of people they say if you don't have the rhetoric same interpretation as me you're not born again I'm not gonna say that now I'll say it to people like you know megachurches you know that we know they're not born again they're smoking and drinking and cussing and and half-naked we know they're not born again you know that's gonna hurt them right if they got the wrong interpretation that's gonna hurt them but brother Aaron says within this message movement if we have a slightly different up rotational hurt because that's not only about one or two of them that pertains the salvation so salvation is the major doctrine see most the quotations is on the other side of the tribulation are on the rapture of the church now a few months later and overcome he said there's a great friend of mine a great teacher bosom friend lovely brother I'd be Darren to say one word against the brother I wanted as a Christian I wouldn't say nothing against him you don't agree with me on what one subject and he's my precious brother we eat together oh he's just a dandy fella I take his magazine read his articles and he writes of some of mine and so forth and I took many attacks out of what I've read of his articles hear him say WOW now if you remember church brother Ram got sermons from this guy's magazine he got sermons from lavell he got sermons from a level right which proves that's the AL apostolic pattern even a prophet could feed off a pastor a perfe can feed off evangelist see we all feed off one another because God ordained oh boy dance amen and you're incomplete without one of them which today they're trying to get rid of the pastor play tapes only I like her brother Donny Reagan said he said yes I'll push play and then here brother branham say that all five people are supposed to preach God I push play dice here brother and say I'm not the only preacher I like that we did more of a may man better called of God I appreciate that brother he's a great man he just can't agree with me I appreciate that of his sincerity so brother and could recognize sincere people though he just thought he's not one of these pushovers and church I'll be honest that's something I have to be careful of there's something burrs a part of me sister Shirley man like that I don't like any conflict at all and there's ever a way I can just like not deal with conflict I'll be there okay I just hate conflict but uh but I've learned God's over the after 13 years of whippings brother William after 13 years of spankings I'm sorry get a backbone I'm not a pushover anymore just have to agree with everything you say he's got his own conviction he stands there for like recent I got a email from a brother saying well you're wrong on the stature of man and I said well brother I love you and I appreciate you for let me preach at your church I said but that's where I stand it's what God's revealed to me I believe such fervor man's of signification message and if everyone sit down and talk about it we're more than welcome to do that I didn't apologize what I preached because I know what's right he's a good man I'm not a teacher or scholar at all but this man is both teacher and scholar he said I can't agree with him because I don't see it but it doesn't pertain to salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the Lord he sees the church has to go through tribulation and purification I say the blood of Jesus Christ purify the church now this is striking this has to be bounced out with our text because in our text hi may Gnaeus and philetus were preaching false doctrine about the coming of the Lord but they were saying the rapture already took place now here he's saying they're not saying the rapture took place they're just saying well the church has to go through tribulation before the rapture oh my goodness are you serious what is it brother Jesse it's like splitting hairs the truth and false was so close together to teach the rapture already happened is death but to preach if they go through the tribulation to get the rapture you can still be saved [Music] see how close it is oh but the only that the elect will not be to see they men what does it take it takes the Spirit of Truth it takes a man who's the noise of the Holy Ghost by the man the god man to preach and rightly divide God's Word never understand yeah all right I think I'm about done we see you got my last quote I got three more no I got whoa whoa oh I got a lot more like if I go through these refit real fast so Holy Ghost filled preachers now these are missionaries now Paul and Barnabas disagreed Barnabas said I'll take mark and Paul said I'm not taking mark we got to split up and so they did now later in the book of 2nd Timothy Paul says mark what he said bring mark with you he can be beneficial for the ministry so at some point and this is one thing I appreciate Albie the last time I was there at some point you know at the beginning Paul said he cannot benefit my ministry I have a prophet ministry I have a healing ministry I see something in marks life he won't help my ministry but later on down the road now he sees some about Mark's character now yeah he can help out my ministry yes praise God now what does that tell us it tells us that people will be a part of this ministry who are qualified to be part of this ministry if you see me inviting people to preach you know I got confidence in them if you see me not asking people to preach then you know I don't I don't have confidence in them and that's been a number of people I've I've given them a chance to preach but later said no I don't see they're not qualified to preach God's Word okay now later it may change right you see there can be contention amongst Holy Ghost filled believers well you got to go through the tribulation and wash your robes right in the blood of Jesus then your rapture no Jesus washes your robes now you're going the rapture before that's fine we're still brothers but if you say the Raps already happened that's from hell is Jesus Christ is still waiting he's still saving he's still making sure those names that although his book a minute or lenzburg life get filled with the Holy Ghost right now amen there's still mercy amen haha that's what he's saying yes now revelation is the greatest realm of ministry corner brother Brandon questions answers on the seals now this is the morning before he preached the seven seals in the evening this is Sunday morning March 63 of all the times I've ever been behind the pulpit at Tabernacle I have never never he said it twice verily verily verily I say I've never never at any time of my ministry ever worked into the realms the shallowness did he say shallowness some people say oh you're preaching the sales and while you you shouldn't preach the seals and know this wasn't shallow this was the realms of God and the spiritual realms as its bent this time yeah it's beyond anything I ever did in any time of my ministry in any meeting at anywhere like this mostly it's on healing see most of his sermons were on healing this is revealing of truth by the same spirit the same spirit Durban South Africa truckloads of crutches going down the road so you can only believe brother Bram said this was actually greater why because it was those seven thunders all the revelations and nobody knew seven thunders seven voices of God Amen revealing the revelations of the seven seals was greater than just by a man why because souls get healed with this one hey man and I've been to myself all together man boarding at a place and going down eating at a place and I just been alone so it's been a really great time the human mind can only stand so much and when you get this spot where you set our nun with the Friends of God and a pillar of light hang in there before you just can't stay there too long the human being can't stand it after sitting writing down the white horse rider for the mic he'd be numb for an hour had to sit there that morning once he got a numb do you go back he got his concordance to start looking up now he did have a phone what is seal anyway what is oil wine anyway let me take it my Bible let me make sure everything that angel said is the Word of God because though we are an angel we've preached to the first let him be cursed glory so church this is something I've got to grow into I get I'll be honest sometimes I get discouraged when I don't see people healed around in our church but I've got to remember it's not about that the greatest realms are not with divine healing the greatest realms are with revealing the truth of God's Word I've got to remember that that's I'm just be honest that's what I need help with because you know all I hear is Bob Arum say all the true church these signs filed in the believe and I hear it all the time you know I must be listening to the sermon sir he's made you're not healing all the time and then I get discouraged well no one got healed today well maybe I'm missing the mark maybe I'm not walking with God and the whole time I could be walking right with God [Music] revealing things you never heard before amen and it wasn't me it was the Holy Spirit and brother amen we could be in the greatest realms and yet the devil will beat me up and be like nobody got healed this week some Holy Ghost you got where's all your signs if you say you're a Christian but I can say back well now devil if I divide the right the word the rightly divided word of truth then I gave people the words of and they're increasing on to more godliness amen yes that's gonna make sure you and I live the right kind of life see any new revelation so even like when I preach this edge word man where it seems like oh that might be new it will be the same revelation just with more information and brother branham tells us in the church age book he talks about the Apostles saying some new apostles Enderlin and he found they were liars and then he quotes this what I just closed though we or an angel preached anything other under you what we've preached letting me curse so Brumaire says it's the Apostles who brought the original word to the people the original word could not change not even a dot or - of it Paul knew it was God's Word or was God who had spoken to him so he said if I even if I come and give a second revelation to try to make one little change in what I gave originally let him be cursed you see Paul knew that first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation then give a second revelation if he did he would not he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it right as he's in the Garden of Eden and when he promised to seed the woman and then later designated that seed would come through Abraham 2,000 years later he added more information and then later designed that seed to come that Abraham and the later center would come by the bloodlines of David but it was the same revelation it only give the people more information to help them receive and understand it to see anything you hear that's new from me or any preacher you and I have to take that back to the word and make sure that lines up with everything we've heard before if it doesn't leave it alone they bloom and the way you do that is take your Bible in your concordance and you see if the scripture teaches that now what a lot of people do today with false doctrine they'll take a quote from brother Branham and they'll take you through the quotes which is okay but those quotes have to be taken back to the scripture like that's a Joseph Coleman it he took the quote about the stepless the virtues and then he found the quote from the revelations series where it says your life is a live voice oh how we need live voices in jeffersonville region I remember that the thing he said the thunder of your life thundering out a live life in Jefferson so he took a quote that wasn't in that sermon and applied at your perfect man when brother man never replied way and church not only did it it didn't work there it didn't work with brother Rams other two quotes for brother Branham said the seven thunders are the revelations contained in the seven seals so see his his he was taken a quote and interpreting him by another quote but actually contradicted the other quotes to see if God gives us anything if God gives us anything that seems new it will line up with all the other quotes and most importantly it'll land up with this word because you change one word of this brother sister you're cursed like we saw today I hate to say but the authors of this are cursed because they took things out of the scripture they took out father word Holy Ghost these three or one they took it out because they want to say gods three persons as a curse behind that now I'm not saying every person that reads it is curse I'm not saying that what I'm saying is if you make this your absolute if you're if you really had a desire to get this out the person who Papa but and it was in your heart to do this then like that Texas you don't like that King James Version now you're cursed because that King James Version is God's Word that's the text that men died for bled for were martyred for were crucified for that's the word that God protected that's the seed that God protected see God's Word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed hallelujah and we see what these false apostles were doing they came with their own word those Ephesians knew that word as Paul taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false prophets in the eye and said you're not saying what Paul said you are therefore follows oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it's not you that really tries the apostle of the Prophet in the teacher it's the word that tries them and church I sent this quote to voice of God those brothers we met with last year I sent them the quotes they said oh we're not going to argue about it I said brother I'm not arguing about it then they never wrote me back I said please write me back let's talk about they never wrote me back up there I'm not trying to argue but I'm trying to test them by the word cuz they got him they got Anu they got a new revelation they're bringing their own word where everything bowed Ram said with us saith the Lord that's not true that's your own word that's not programs word that's not the Bible's word most important it's not Jesus's word right because everything brother Branham says has to be taken back to the word see one of these days there's gonna come a prophet the latest in church age and you know if he's the real ones that from God or not yes you will for he's of God and he'll be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a ruler not one iota in the last age will there be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them or what they say you're lost no I didn't say that at all if you don't agree with my teaching on the centaurum and you're not lost you're still saved and I hope you say I'm saved too but if you change salvation to make it something outside of the blood of Jesus Christ or make it the blood of Jesus plus your Antichrist amen the salvation is the blood of Jesus Christ amen faith you're not saved by works you're saved by grace through faith you must have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive you and you always say that's a major amen that's why Jehovah's Witnesses can still be saved right they can still be safe as long as in the blood they're still virgin if they're by the blood sea they'll keep telling you if you don't believe them they're you're lost but when the last a prophet comes on the scene if he's truly the prophet help me cry now get back to the Lord or you are lost he will be on a private revelation interpretation around the word amen a man let's say to our feet remember program when I preach us I preach a revelation in series on chapter 4 brother bran tells us this is how you interpret he said he said the reason we know that 24 elders are not angels is because of he lists all these scriptures see they'll let you know there redeem men they're not angels the 24 elders he says how do you know yes he said you have to consider the dress consider the dress consider their position you said can you have to consider all the scripture around them so see when you interpret something you have to consider every detail of the word and take it back to the rest of the word because that's what brother Ram did when God gave him the seals he watched the vision wrote it down went back and makes sure okay that that was that true the Old Testament is that true the Newton okay now I got revelation now I know it's that saith the Lord and he says you can compare scriptures I better stop here let me just stop I think I got yeah I got too many a guy but I will read II so you got to sit through full three more quotes let's got to use the restroom now what did they do they didn't know today men walk in early they don't know that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism listen the reason they don't know the message they don't dig down deep enough to get in the spirit of Revelation amen and that makes me sad I'm about ready to cry because I think all my friends who study the Bible but they don't study deep enough I gave my book I give my book brother Mike and they don't read it again I'll give it I'll give it about 80 books already and hardly anybody will even say anything about it after I give it out they just they don't want to dig down they don't want to get in the spirit revelation but I want to get in the spirit of Revelation that's one place I want to get to brother Mike I wanna get in the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough because jesus said if you ask you shall the reason people don't receive the message because they don't ask for it or the Bible said they ask with selfish intentions that they may consume it upon their lusts God give me a great revelation so I can have a mega church we get more people come to our church that's the that's a selfish ambition but this morning I prayed God give me your word so I can feed your lamb not for popularity not for money but so your sheep feast on your word hallelujah no matter who comes or who goes god let me just feed your little lambs did Jesus know Peter do you love me Peter he said yes you know I love you then he said feed my lambs amen how do you know Jesus I'm feeding his lehem hallelujah that's my desire and we want to get in the spirit of Revelation if revelation is beyond you look up and see God for it now I'm skipping ahead because the time we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world let's stop right there for musicians if you'll come here curse that's why if we don't see miracles going on it's okay we should still cry out for more revelation because that's a greater realm than just divine healing do I appreciate divine healing of course don't want to see more miracles more gifts yes but the greatest realm is when someone doesn't know thus saith the Lord and then God reveals to them the revelation of the Word of God and now you've gone beyond just the body and now you've gone down to the soul now you're standing on the say the Lord the greatest realm there is praise God well my burdens been delivered praise the Lord I can relax Oh second service church I hope you know I've had people you know listen to my sermons and say all you you're you're trying to get rid of brother Branham and I'm not trying to get rid of brother Branham anyone that knows me knows I'm not trying to get rid of it available what I'm trying to do is rightly divide everything take everything he said and take it back to the word I'm just trying to do it brother Branham said and then people say you're not doing what you're trying to get rid of brother Branham I'm not trying to I'm just trying to do it [Music] may God help us Church to pray for a revelation more than anything else Heavenly Father we love you today nor these are just precious times I really feel your presence this morning and lord it may not be from divine healing and forgive me Lord because often I just I desire to see these signs follow me as a believer and I've no doubt that unbalance in that Lord I'm pressured myself you know years ago I apologized to the church for pressure in the church with those things we know it's important but it's a high nerd orkut the greatest realms we can work in lord is revelation the rightly divide the word where we can stand torrential or satan say it's also written see we love you lord god I love you Jesus you know I'm not trying to get rid of your prophet I love your proper level greenness quotes listening to him lord I forgive anyone that misunderstands me Lord yelling I forgive them or because if I can't forgive them you can't forgive me as that prayer says forgive our debtors as we forgive those who are knitted to us we love you Lord today I just pray these truths to be anchored down in the hearts of the people and they would see Lord what the Holy Spirit is doing in this hour trying to reveal more of the word give us more of the same revelation more information on the same revelation there's already past the days where people are stirred up and by the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or even Malachi 4 5 and 6 that God has set a prophet with people Lord you're trying to get us to advance Lord God to more of the revelation but Lord we got to dig deeper amen or we've got the pray more for Revelation we can't be content with our walk with you Lord God so father with this anointing of the Holy Spirit I pray we pray for more revelation you're nothing or truth in our lives do your God more of your your true word father more of a straight line with your word give us more precise word Lord God and let us seek it Lord and let us pray for it father we know as we seek this word we seek the revelation we know these signs will continue to follow us because we're believers and all I just say a little prayer Lord now for Joel Osteen's church Lord God and the Jehovah's Witnesses and those that I mentioned here today Lord now they don't like to call names Nordmann to help the people understand I pray all those Lord even Joel self all those that are ordained to life will come out of false doctors I know you'll save all that can be saved but I want to put my voice in on the day of judgment that I prayed for them Lord time lord I cried out to God Lord deliver them from the gangrene heal their spiritual diseases Lord come and save all those who are ignorant Lord God of these false doctrines that have been corrupted the church systems I want my voice to be on record they're not that I've learned them to be saved up videos to get them to be saved I tried everything I could to get people to dig deeper in the Word of God and getting the spirit of Revelation hey father bless us now in your divine presence in Jesus Christ's name the church said if anyone desires prayer for healing or desires prayer you're welcome to come up Jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you're [Music] [Music] [Music] draw me closer to you you say you are my [Music] it's not enough to be a woman to baby back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
