[49:28] in us to to bring a message to his
[49:30] congregation so thank you very much I
[49:32] appreciate that um and my wife said that
[49:35] I should tell you a little bit about
[49:36] myself before preach um uh my parents um
[49:42] were in the message I was so I was born
[49:45] uh coming to church um you know so I was
[49:48] born and raised in the church um and I
[49:50] believe brother Paul and sister Tris
[49:52] were also uh in the church at that time
[49:54] as well um so eser and I actually grew
[49:57] up together in in in the church we have
[49:59] pictures you know of us this this small
[50:02] together at parties and such um I didn't
[50:06] notice her in that way until I was 19
[50:08] but um you know I I grew up in the
[50:10] church um but uh God doesn't have
[50:14] grandchildren right amen um so when I
[50:18] was in high school and try to figure out
[50:20] things for myself and U had backslid um
[50:24] trying to do my own way my own things um
[50:27] but at the age of 19 was a freshman in
[50:29] in college um God had uh revealed his
[50:34] grace to me um and and save saved my
[50:37] soul that was in 1992 in December um and
[50:41] I had my own plans but he had other
[50:43] plans for me and you know it's a true
[50:45] conversion when you know after you're
[50:48] saved you can't get enough of the
[50:51] work am I know for that whole next year
[50:54] or year and a half or so um just drink
[50:57] drink drink um you know diving into the
[51:00] messages from Malachi 4 and just you
[51:02] know I think I we listening to one of
[51:05] your messages last night you said it's
[51:06] like fireworks you hear this message is
[51:08] fireworks for the first time it's you
[51:10] know Dawning on you and the Revelation
[51:12] is just so strong um and that was the
[51:15] foundation that God gave me to take me
[51:17] through life's journey over the next 30
[51:20] 30 years
[51:22] amen um so uh this evening um is is
[51:27] going to be a an exort
[51:29] exhortation um a little testifying um
[51:33] and some teaching um so we just stand
[51:36] for the reading of the word I'm going to
[51:38] read from Psalms
[51:40] 107 starting at verse
[51:47] 1-9 and my title this evening is oh that
[51:50] men would praise the Lord for his
[51:53] goodness amen
[51:57] so Psalms 107 says oh give thanks unto
[52:01] the Lord for he is good for his mercy
[52:04] endureth forever amen let the redeemed
[52:07] of the Lord say so so whom he hath
[52:10] redeemed from the hand of the enemy and
[52:13] gathered them out of the lands from the
[52:14] East and from the west from the north
[52:17] and from the south they wandered in the
[52:20] wilderness in a solitary way they found
[52:22] no City to dwell in hungry and thirsty
[52:25] their souls fainted in them
[52:27] then they Cried unto the Lord in their
[52:29] trouble and he delivered them out of
[52:31] their distresses and he led them forth
[52:33] by the right way that they may go to a
[52:36] city of habitation oh that men would
[52:39] praise the Lord for his goodness and for
[52:42] his wonderful Works to the children of
[52:44] men for he satisfieth the longing soul
[52:48] and filth the hungry soul with goodness
[52:51] amen I want to also read from Isaiah
[52:55] 26 verse 3 and
[52:58] 4 AM
[53:02] amen Isaiah 26 verse three and four I'm
[53:05] gon to make myself comfortable
[53:20] here do
[53:24] that I take it in he takes his Co quite
[53:27] often
[53:29] amen Isaiah 26 verse three thou will
[53:33] keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
[53:36] stayed on thee because he trusteth in
[53:39] thee trust ye in the Lord forever for
[53:42] the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength
[53:46] amen you may be
[53:47] seated so again my title is oh that men
[53:50] would praise the Lord for his goodness
[53:53] and in this Psalm Psalms 107 um there's
[53:57] multiple sections to it uh verses 1
[54:00] through three is thanking the Lord let
[54:02] the redeemed of the Lord say so verses
[54:05] 4-9 is the Lord giving help to those
[54:08] that are finding a new
[54:10] city uh verses 10 through 16 the lord
[54:13] gave help to those that are in prison uh
[54:16] verses 17 to 22 the lord gave help to
[54:18] those who were sick uh verse 23-32 the
[54:22] lord gave help to those on the sea and
[54:25] then verse 3 3 to 43 it's the Lord
[54:28] talking about the wonderful things that
[54:29] he does and so in in reference to
[54:33] testimony um you know brother Paul and I
[54:37] often say that I don't really like to
[54:39] call myself a preacher per se I just
[54:42] love the word and as I'm in the word and
[54:44] he shows me stuff or teaches me stuff in
[54:47] my life I like to share I like to share
[54:49] with others to help them along the
[54:51] journey um so in my devotions and it was
[54:54] a year ago on May 31st uh last year this
[54:59] was uh my daily devotion for the day I
[55:01] was reading Psalms 107 and then when the
[55:03] Lord really presses something on your on
[55:05] your heart you you pay attention right
[55:08] um and he had really put on my heart um
[55:11] the verses uh
[55:14] 23-32 and I'll just I'll read those in
[55:17] particular um because God likes to deal
[55:20] with us each individual differently
[55:22] depending on kind of what sets you off
[55:25] right like what so easily beset you well
[55:27] he's going to work on that to teach you
[55:29] his ways so Psalm uh 107:23 says they
[55:33] that go down to the Sea and ships that
[55:35] do business in Great Waters these see
[55:38] the works of the Lord and his wonders in
[55:40] the Deep for he commandeth and raiseth
[55:43] the stormy wind which lifted up the
[55:46] waves thereof they mount it up to heaven
[55:48] they go down again to the depths their
[55:51] soul is melted because of trouble they
[55:53] reel to and fro and stagger like drunk
[55:56] men and are at their wits end then they
[55:59] cry unto the Lord in their trouble and
[56:02] he bringeth them out of their distresses
[56:04] he maketh the storm a calm so that the
[56:07] waves thereof are still then they are
[56:10] glad because they be quiet so that he
[56:13] bringeth them unto their desired haven
[56:16] oh that men would praise the Lord for
[56:18] his goodness and for his wonderful Works
[56:19] to the Children of Men Let Them exalt
[56:22] him also in the congregation of the
[56:24] people and praise him in the Assembly of
[56:25] Elders
[56:27] I actually pre this this this stuck on
[56:29] my heart so much I actually preached a
[56:30] message last year on it um and just as a
[56:34] little background me and my wife own a
[56:36] business um it's a it's a remodeling
[56:39] construction business um and I have like
[56:41] 13 employees or 12 or 13 employees um
[56:45] and probably about six to nine months
[56:47] before this the economy changed and you
[56:49] know so it was a bit tough um you know
[56:52] and we're kind of just managing um you
[56:55] know kind of month to month month or so
[56:56] and it was getting to where I was
[56:58] managing cash flow on a on on a on a
[57:01] monthly basis you know are you going to
[57:02] make payroll and kind of things like
[57:03] that but like I said the Lord works on
[57:05] you for what kind of sets you off right
[57:07] and my wife will tell you that finances
[57:09] is kind of one of the things in my area
[57:11] is that like I need to get on my knees
[57:13] sometimes uh and you just remember who's
[57:15] who's in control so he had put this
[57:16] scripture on my heart um and really had
[57:20] me uh study it um and there's several
[57:23] things I want to bring out that that
[57:25] hopefully the Lord will would um bless
[57:27] you with um because the end of the psalm
[57:31] on Psalm 43 it says whoever is wise will
[57:34] observe these things even they shall un
[57:38] they shall understand the loving
[57:39] kindness of the Lord
[57:42] amen um so the thing the the three
[57:45] things in this scripture in this uh
[57:47] chapter that the Lord was really
[57:48] bringing out to me and and asking me to
[57:50] pay attention to was the beginning where
[57:53] he says oh give thanks unto the Lord for
[57:55] he is good for his mercy endureth
[57:57] forever let the redeemed of the Lord say
[57:59] so amen right so am I redeemed do I know
[58:03] that I am redeemed amen so then I need
[58:06] to say so amen and then you know it
[58:10] talks about the men that do business and
[58:11] go on uh to do uh business on the waters
[58:14] and how the waves are tumultous and they
[58:17] fear within themselves right but it says
[58:19] oh that I wish that men would praise the
[58:21] Lord so the Lord was really telling me
[58:23] praise me no matter what happens what
[58:26] you go through you need to praise me
[58:29] amen and that's that line oh that men
[58:32] would praise the Lord for his goodness
[58:34] and for his wonderful Works to the
[58:36] children men has an explanation point on
[58:38] and it's repeated four times in the
[58:40] chapter amen so that's something that
[58:42] you should pay attention to amen amen so
[58:46] I started testifying right away um I I
[58:48] had uh I have a a business advisor that
[58:50] was helping me through these times and
[58:52] just kind of managing things and um I'm
[58:54] thankful to the Lord that he a Christian
[58:56] so I had told him about this scripture
[58:59] and I said the lord gave me the
[59:00] scripture now the Lord doesn't tell you
[59:03] how long right he he'll reveal something
[59:06] to you that's going to happen and take
[59:08] place but he doesn't sometimes doesn't
[59:09] tell you how long and I had been kind of
[59:12] going through this time for about six to
[59:14] nine months already so I'm thinking the
[59:15] Lord's giving me the scripture because
[59:17] we're at an end soon but not so but
[59:21] anyway I I took heed to the scripture to
[59:26] praise the Lord so I started testifying
[59:28] I told my business advisor the lord gave
[59:30] me this scripture so we're going to
[59:32] press on we're going to press forward
[59:34] and I'm going to give thanks unto the
[59:35] Lord and he's going to see me through I
[59:37] don't know how it doesn't tell me how
[59:38] and but it says that he will calm the
[59:40] storm and then he will lead me to the
[59:43] desired Port so I'm going to start
[59:45] telling everybody about it amen so what
[59:48] the Lord was really trying to show me
[59:49] and again I'm going to testify personal
[59:52] experiences so may help you on your
[59:54] journey right um is not to look at the
[59:57] glass half empty right we all know
[1:00:00] Romans 7 and Romans 8 right Romans 7
[1:00:04] says I find a law then a law that when I
[1:00:07] would do good evil is always present we
[1:00:09] know the devil's always trying to fight
[1:00:11] us for I Delight in the law of God after
[1:00:14] the inward man but when I see another
[1:00:16] law of my members Waring against the law
[1:00:18] of my mind and bringing me into
[1:00:21] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[1:00:23] my members oh Wretched Man am I
[1:00:27] what am I doing I'm looking at myself
[1:00:29] right Romans 8 though is everything that
[1:00:32] God does for us right and those are the
[1:00:36] things that we should be looking at so
[1:00:37] he wants us to look at Romans
[1:00:40] 8 amen amen right that's a glass half
[1:00:43] full and and that's also someone that
[1:00:45] can fill it to
[1:00:47] overflowing amen so like moving from the
[1:00:50] outer Court being governed by the
[1:00:52] heavens and the the the weather outside
[1:00:55] going into the hes of holies right
[1:00:57] Romans 81 there's therefore no
[1:01:00] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:01:03] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:01:06] after the
[1:01:07] spirit for as many as are led by the
[1:01:10] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:01:13] for we have not received the spirit of
[1:01:14] ab bondage again to fear right like
[1:01:17] don't be afraid that's Jesus always said
[1:01:19] that whenever he met anybody he said
[1:01:21] don't be afraid right so God's telling
[1:01:24] me don't be like the men in this Psalm
[1:01:27] where they feared for the waves that
[1:01:29] were going to drown them but do not be
[1:01:32] afraid be led by the spirit of God amen
[1:01:35] amen uh but we have received the spirit
[1:01:38] of adoption where we cry ABA father why
[1:01:42] what does it what does it say in verse
[1:01:44] 18 for I reckon that the suffering of
[1:01:47] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:01:49] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:01:52] revealed in us right so we all know that
[1:01:55] we have to go through trials and
[1:01:57] temptations and struggles right but not
[1:02:00] to look at that because the sufferings
[1:02:02] won't compare to what's going to be
[1:02:04] revealed in us right amen right because
[1:02:08] it says on that last verse in Psalms 107
[1:02:10] I'm sorry I'm jumping around so much on
[1:02:12] you um whosoever is wise and will
[1:02:15] observe these things even they shall
[1:02:18] understand the loving kindness of the
[1:02:20] Lord right because he's going to bring
[1:02:21] me out of the distress he's going to
[1:02:23] bring us out of the storms amen so he's
[1:02:26] asking for me to surrender my path to
[1:02:30] him right as a business owner is someone
[1:02:33] that's used to being in control right
[1:02:36] but as a Christian I'm I'm not the one
[1:02:38] in control right I need to surrender my
[1:02:40] ways to him and be led by him right
[1:02:44] that's no matter what the path may be or
[1:02:47] how long the path may be right like
[1:02:49] we're always in a hurry to solve it to
[1:02:52] get it resolved to get it fixed but
[1:02:55] sometimes there's a lesson in the
[1:02:57] journey itself amen and in the message
[1:03:01] all the days of our lives he says when
[1:03:03] we receive Christ it isn't just for a
[1:03:05] few hours or or just for the time of the
[1:03:08] Revival but it's to last all the days of
[1:03:11] our life he says am I ready to surrender
[1:03:14] all my life to him that's the only way
[1:03:17] that he will accept you is when you give
[1:03:19] all your life a man is prone to have his
[1:03:22] own way man wants to do things um he
[1:03:26] wants to do it his own way he showed
[1:03:27] that the first few hours after the fall
[1:03:29] in the Garden of Eden he wanted to do
[1:03:31] his own way right he's talking about
[1:03:32] when when Adam went and found fig leaves
[1:03:35] to create his own religion yes amen he
[1:03:38] wanted to do it own way because man is
[1:03:40] always uh satisfied as long as he's
[1:03:42] doing it his own way and then he gives
[1:03:44] an analogy where he says did you ever
[1:03:46] notice when you're driving with somebody
[1:03:48] else there's just all kinds of mistakes
[1:03:50] that they
[1:03:52] make come on pre
[1:03:56] you push the floorboard out of the other
[1:03:58] other side almost trying to stop the car
[1:04:01] yourself and and in your mind you say
[1:04:04] well why did he do it that
[1:04:08] way I mean why why did he turn this way
[1:04:11] why did he do it own to see that's just
[1:04:12] the nature of man he wants it his own
[1:04:15] way right and God did not make man to
[1:04:18] desire his own way he made man to depend
[1:04:20] on
[1:04:21] him Amen to forsake his ways to crucify
[1:04:25] his way he likened us unto Sheep amen
[1:04:29] when we become Christians we totally
[1:04:31] surrender every bit of our mental powers
[1:04:34] to God and follow after his leading and
[1:04:37] as long as we try to go after our own
[1:04:40] feeling then we are using the Fallen
[1:04:42] state of the being amen and if a man
[1:04:45] will just come uh that close to God when
[1:04:48] when you're lost um don't try to find
[1:04:51] your way back right that's usually what
[1:04:53] we we trying to figure it out don't try
[1:04:56] to find your way back just surrender to
[1:04:58] him and he will lead you back don't try
[1:05:01] to figure it out that's the mental
[1:05:03] Powers amen and that's so many M that's
[1:05:06] so many times we as Christians make the
[1:05:09] mistake of trying to use our natural
[1:05:13] senses whether it be our five senses or
[1:05:16] our our human Spirit five senses to to
[1:05:19] interpret the word like I've used the
[1:05:20] analogy before it's like this is the
[1:05:23] word and then I'm I'm trying to look at
[1:05:26] my five senses so let's if I'm sick
[1:05:28] right I'm I'm looking at my symptoms to
[1:05:31] see if this is true or I'm using my
[1:05:34] imagination and my reasoning power to
[1:05:37] try and figure out when the trial is
[1:05:38] going to be over by what he said right
[1:05:41] and then so many people get frustrated
[1:05:43] and walk away from the word because
[1:05:45] they're trying to look at it this way
[1:05:47] but we're supposed to look at it this
[1:05:48] way right amen right so right it says
[1:05:53] Adam staggered not through unbelief but
[1:05:56] giving praise to God not the promise
[1:05:58] because he wasn't looking this way at
[1:06:00] the word he was looking this way at the
[1:06:02] word waiting for this to come into
[1:06:05] subjection to the Bible
[1:06:07] amen praise
[1:06:09] God
[1:06:11] Amen thank you Lord amen so um in the
[1:06:15] Garden of Eden uh God and the devil
[1:06:18] chose their part of the man the devil
[1:06:20] took his head and God took his heart
[1:06:24] amen faith is the substance of things
[1:06:26] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[1:06:28] Seen he just believes it because God
[1:06:30] said it he don't have to see nothing or
[1:06:34] no sense of his body has to declare it
[1:06:37] he just believes it in his soul where
[1:06:39] God lives God wants to lead him to the
[1:06:42] path of worship that really struck
[1:06:45] struck me there right says oh that I
[1:06:48] wish that men would praise the Lord for
[1:06:49] his goodness right he wants us to
[1:06:51] worship Him amen and depend fully on him
[1:06:56] if God depended holy and uh holy and
[1:06:59] complete surrender to be led by his
[1:07:01] Spirit at the beginning then that's the
[1:07:03] way it it will have to be forever amen
[1:07:06] Cain wanted to be religious uh he
[1:07:08] brought it before God with something
[1:07:10] like this here's the best that I've got
[1:07:13] this is all I can do about it now take
[1:07:16] it or leave
[1:07:17] it right good now that's the best that I
[1:07:19] can do um I believe that a Christian
[1:07:22] Life is continual sacrifice yes
[1:07:26] he that will come after me let him deny
[1:07:28] himself daily every day not 46 days but
[1:07:31] every day how the Christian loves to do
[1:07:35] it he doesn't do it with a grudge he
[1:07:37] does it uh with a feeling that he loves
[1:07:39] God it's a joy to serve the Lord It's a
[1:07:42] joy to sacrifice it's a joy to Worship
[1:07:45] the Lord amen hallelujah praise God good
[1:07:49] amen so in Psalms 107 says let the
[1:07:51] redeemed of the Lord say so right we all
[1:07:53] know what redeemed means by back right
[1:07:56] that I've been bought with a price right
[1:07:59] that my price has been paid and I've
[1:08:01] never did it in the first place amen so
[1:08:04] it says let the redeemed say so so if I
[1:08:06] know that I've been bought back and now
[1:08:08] it's not I'm not looking at my
[1:08:10] righteousness I'm looking at the
[1:08:12] righteousness of Christ right he died
[1:08:15] that I may take on his righteousness
[1:08:18] amen praise God right it says whosoever
[1:08:22] is wise and will observe these things
[1:08:25] so wise uh in in the Hebrew is HEM um it
[1:08:31] means to be wise or
[1:08:33] skilled um where like when when and
[1:08:37] that's where old philosophy is different
[1:08:40] from new pH philosophy right like when
[1:08:42] the Greeks talk about wisdom it's
[1:08:44] usually intellectual theoretical
[1:08:48] abstract right right where wisdom when
[1:08:51] it's uh coming from the Hebrew uh was a
[1:08:54] skill in practical iCal matters amen
[1:08:57] that's subject to Divine causes so
[1:09:00] therefore hebrewism so when saying so
[1:09:02] whoever is
[1:09:03] wise um was um not theoretical and
[1:09:07] speculative but it was practical based
[1:09:09] on revealed principles uh of right or
[1:09:12] wrong to be lived out in daily life amen
[1:09:21] amen amen and then uh loving kind
[1:09:26] right so this is again from that same uh
[1:09:28] verse whoever is wise and will observe
[1:09:30] these things even they shall understand
[1:09:33] the loving kindness of the Lord so
[1:09:36] loving kindness I when I dove into that
[1:09:38] it really blessed me so I just wanted to
[1:09:39] share that with you the the Hebrew word
[1:09:41] used there in the Old Testament for
[1:09:43] loving kindness is H said it said it's
[1:09:45] not merely an emotion or feeling but
[1:09:48] involves action on behalf of someone who
[1:09:51] is in need amen the core idea of this
[1:09:54] term communic Ates loyalty or
[1:09:57] faithfulness within a relationship so
[1:09:59] thank you for your special when I heard
[1:10:01] you practicing was like oh this is going
[1:10:02] to be right here in the message God's
[1:10:05] faithfulness uh within a relationship it
[1:10:08] is the inclination of the heart to show
[1:10:10] Amazing Grace to the one who is loved
[1:10:13] when it comes to life and actions God's
[1:10:16] has said manifested in forgiveness makes
[1:10:18] a relationship with him possible amen so
[1:10:22] we understand so he's saying whoever is
[1:10:25] WI and will observe these things is
[1:10:26] going to understand the amazing grace of
[1:10:28] God so how like I I read it in the Bible
[1:10:33] right and it's real but he wants to make
[1:10:36] it even more real to us right so he's
[1:10:38] going to allow things in our lives and
[1:10:41] things to us to go through so that he
[1:10:43] can demonstrate to us personally his
[1:10:45] loving kindness His Amazing Grace To Us
[1:10:49] amen praise
[1:10:51] God right so what the Lord was telling
[1:10:54] me through the the psalm was I need to
[1:10:57] know that I'm redeemed right by his
[1:11:00] Amazing Grace there's no condemnation to
[1:11:03] them that are in Christ Jesus right so
[1:11:05] I'm not getting confused or concerned by
[1:11:08] the trial that I'm going through right
[1:11:10] because I have no cond condemnation
[1:11:12] because I'm walking after the spirit
[1:11:15] amen and I know that the suffering of
[1:11:17] this world is not worthy to be compared
[1:11:19] to his glory right so it doesn't matter
[1:11:21] what I'm going to go through if he told
[1:11:23] me he's going to be with me that's all I
[1:11:26] need
[1:11:27] amen um and I'm not looking at the trial
[1:11:31] half full I'm looking I mean half empty
[1:11:33] I'm looking at it full half full on you
[1:11:35] know where God can resolve it for me so
[1:11:38] it's not my way I need to surrender my
[1:11:40] way and I need to praise Him
[1:11:43] amen and it's not whistling through the
[1:11:46] graveyard kind of Praise right it's true
[1:11:52] praise with faith right faith is is the
[1:11:55] heart of the matter faith is not
[1:11:58] abstract right it's a substance right he
[1:12:00] says faith is the substance of things
[1:12:02] hoped for right and as I was saying like
[1:12:05] Hebrew is an action-based language so
[1:12:08] the word many times used in the Old
[1:12:09] Testament for faith is imuna um and it's
[1:12:13] based upon uh the the word that it's
[1:12:17] based upon is
[1:12:19] amen um it is something that can be
[1:12:21] affirmed in
[1:12:23] reality and not arbitrary
[1:12:25] and baseless so we don't believe blindly
[1:12:28] right there's a there's a basis for the
[1:12:30] faith that we have amen so it's imuna is
[1:12:33] defined as stable done in a trustworthy
[1:12:37] Manner and then there's other words that
[1:12:38] are derived from it as well imim which
[1:12:41] is loyal one who is trustworthy Omen
[1:12:44] which is experience Amana which is
[1:12:46] agreement or loyalty so all these words
[1:12:49] represent the concept of something that
[1:12:51] can be trusted duee to the fact that
[1:12:53] someone has done Deeds that prove that
[1:12:56] they are trustworthy and will be loyal
[1:12:58] to their actions and promises that
[1:13:00] sounds like he's the same yesterday
[1:13:02] today and forever amen praise
[1:13:07] God so faith is trust due to proven
[1:13:10] actions which affirm the trust the truth
[1:13:13] of the trust right so here like I don't
[1:13:16] look at this as fairy tale as brother
[1:13:18] Paul was saying this morning to me this
[1:13:20] is this is fact right right everything
[1:13:25] in here is true even more real than me
[1:13:29] right so when I look at this as being
[1:13:31] fact I can trust what what it says I can
[1:13:34] see uh what happened in the past and how
[1:13:37] he behaved how God delivered his people
[1:13:40] saved his people right so my faith
[1:13:43] starts there right it says faith cometh
[1:13:45] by hearing right but then he also wants
[1:13:48] to do this personally in your own life
[1:13:51] right right so to build upon it so then
[1:13:53] now that you it's you're not saying it
[1:13:55] because it's written here you're not
[1:13:56] saying it because you were raised that
[1:13:58] way or that your parents said or you
[1:13:59] heard somebody else say sure it starts
[1:14:01] there but then he wants to make it
[1:14:03] personal to you amen praise
[1:14:07] God right when um well Paul had
[1:14:09] mentioned this earlier right the
[1:14:11] Israelites after the Red Sea three days
[1:14:13] later they started complaining right
[1:14:15] right and it's it's not that they didn't
[1:14:17] believe God they they did believe God
[1:14:20] their problem was they didn't trust him
[1:14:22] right so like it say because it says the
[1:14:24] devil beles right so it's not belief
[1:14:27] only it's also faith and and Trust uh in
[1:14:32] in God Amen imuna also translates as
[1:14:37] faithfulness right it reveals a life
[1:14:39] full of Reliance upon Him
[1:14:42] amen uh so faith that results in
[1:14:45] faithfulness implying action right so
[1:14:47] that's James uh where he talks about
[1:14:50] faith is work Works Express right so
[1:14:53] right because because I have faith Faith
[1:14:55] then I'm going to do things I'm going to
[1:14:57] put it into
[1:14:58] action amen praise
[1:15:01] God
[1:15:06] um amen so he says realizing something
[1:15:10] very profound here it's like when we say
[1:15:11] Amen at the end of a prayer it's not
[1:15:13] just a closing statement or a ritual
[1:15:15] word it is an agreement to act upon what
[1:15:17] was prayed right so after we pray
[1:15:20] something and we say Amen you know
[1:15:21] brother Brandon said it many times so be
[1:15:23] it right so we're we're we're in
[1:15:25] agreement that what we say is going to
[1:15:27] happen amen and God is inviting us into
[1:15:32] partnership that's what faith is is he's
[1:15:34] inviting us into a personal relationship
[1:15:36] into partnership with him amen praise
[1:15:40] God praise God so the times when he
[1:15:43] knows and allows us to walk into
[1:15:46] circumstances that turn out to be
[1:15:47] challenging or even wretched this is God
[1:15:50] allowing us to participate in faith amen
[1:15:55] to make it personal to us
[1:15:57] amen right in his Sovereign wisdom God
[1:16:00] gives us these storms for our advantage
[1:16:03] and sanctification so that our faith
[1:16:06] might be perfected amen amen it's in
[1:16:08] terms of building layers of trust to the
[1:16:10] foundation of faith that I have in
[1:16:12] Christ right it's like David right he
[1:16:15] God gave him the experience like so I'm
[1:16:17] sure David was taught from a youth about
[1:16:19] God right from his parents and his
[1:16:21] fathers they told the stories they heard
[1:16:22] it from the rabbis right and then he put
[1:16:25] it into action when he was a a Shepherd
[1:16:27] right God gave him the experience with
[1:16:29] the bear and with the lion so that when
[1:16:32] he came to Goliath he already had
[1:16:34] personal experiences that was going to
[1:16:36] build layers of trust in God Amen praise
[1:16:40] God hallelujah so God wants to see our
[1:16:42] faith in action amen so this is what God
[1:16:46] was saying to me was he was asking me to
[1:16:50] cry unto him to even though I'm going to
[1:16:53] go through great storm great trial and I
[1:16:56] need to know that he's going to bring me
[1:16:58] to a desired Haven and I need to praise
[1:17:01] Him amen not whistling through the
[1:17:04] graveyard praise him but true worship
[1:17:08] and true Thanksgiving knowing that he's
[1:17:10] the one that's going to resolve it right
[1:17:13] amen we know many times brother Brandon
[1:17:16] says and he says here in Works Faith
[1:17:18] Works is Faith Express faith is a
[1:17:20] revelation from God now Faith is a
[1:17:22] revelation he's revealed it to you by
[1:17:25] his grace it's nothing you did you
[1:17:27] didn't work yourself up into Faith you
[1:17:30] ever have faith it's given to you by the
[1:17:33] grace of God God reveals it to you
[1:17:36] therefore faith is a revelation right so
[1:17:38] when when when I got saved he revealed
[1:17:42] to me his grace and Redemption right so
[1:17:45] when now I wanted to have my life
[1:17:47] transformed and follow after him amen so
[1:17:50] that was a gift that he gave me to see
[1:17:53] his great plan and know that I was a
[1:17:55] filthy wretch amen so it's a gift from
[1:17:59] God and if you ever really want to know
[1:18:01] if you have a
[1:18:03] revelation it's something that is
[1:18:05] completely obvious to you but it's not
[1:18:08] necessarily obvious to everybody else
[1:18:09] like when I read when I read the word of
[1:18:11] God and then I re read the revealed word
[1:18:13] of God from Malachi 4 it is so obvious
[1:18:17] to me right that it's revealing this
[1:18:21] right and it's revealing the word of God
[1:18:22] like there's no way you could even
[1:18:24] possibly me out of it it's not even an
[1:18:27] option because they line up so perfectly
[1:18:30] well that's a gift that was given to me
[1:18:32] by God to see his word amen praise God
[1:18:37] Amen he says now I can't make you
[1:18:39] believe neither can you make yourself
[1:18:42] believe God has got to give it to you
[1:18:45] it's a gift of God to believe not your
[1:18:48] faith God's
[1:18:50] faith your intellectual Faith might
[1:18:53] believe is fine but unless the faith of
[1:18:56] God is down in your heart see you your
[1:18:59] intellectual faith can accept it um but
[1:19:02] you just keep believing until God
[1:19:04] reveals it to you that's when it's
[1:19:06] anchored beyond anything nothing will
[1:19:09] move you from it that's when you know
[1:19:10] it's been revealed from Christ himself
[1:19:13] amen hallelujah and it's a gift from
[1:19:16] God Amen what is faith faith is
[1:19:19] something that's revealed to you that is
[1:19:21] not yet but you believe it will be faith
[1:19:23] is a revelation of the will of God I
[1:19:26] love that uh statement from brother
[1:19:28] Brandon that was from anointed ones at
[1:19:30] the end times says faith is a revelation
[1:19:32] of the will of God right so God was
[1:19:34] giving me Grace when I when he pressed
[1:19:38] upon my heart Psalms 107 right he's
[1:19:40] telling me his wills for me to go
[1:19:42] through trial right so he's saying don't
[1:19:45] don't get condemned by it you didn't do
[1:19:47] anything wrong I'm the one that's going
[1:19:49] to bring you through it praise me and
[1:19:52] cry out to me through it amen prise God
[1:19:55] so he was increasing my faith by showing
[1:19:58] me his will
[1:20:01] amen now I love this too this from thy
[1:20:03] house now Faith is a law of God all this
[1:20:07] power of God that we're talking about is
[1:20:10] accessible To Us by faith all things are
[1:20:13] possible say to this mountain be moved
[1:20:15] and don't doubt in your heart believe
[1:20:17] what you you said come to pass you can
[1:20:20] have it accessible you've got the law
[1:20:22] there it is the law is faith that
[1:20:24] controls all things amen amen perfect
[1:20:28] faith is a master of all
[1:20:31] circumstances no matter what it is it
[1:20:33] Masters it when you believe anything do
[1:20:36] anything and you've got faith in what
[1:20:38] you're doing no matter what the
[1:20:41] circumstances just don't ask any
[1:20:46] questions I didn't say that amen this is
[1:20:49] from perfect Faith just don't ask any
[1:20:52] questions meaning don't question God
[1:20:54] like if he revealed something to you and
[1:20:55] that's going to take place right so then
[1:20:58] then I can have perfect faith I can have
[1:21:00] perfect trust in God that he's going to
[1:21:03] work it out no matter what I'm going to
[1:21:04] go through right
[1:21:07] amen cuz that's where the the Mind wants
[1:21:10] to go right the Mind wants to go it's
[1:21:12] just it's natural I'm a planner so just
[1:21:14] it's what my mind does I'm always
[1:21:15] looking at six steps ahead of me right
[1:21:18] it's just the way my mind wants to go so
[1:21:20] obviously God wants to train me on his
[1:21:23] will right so he's going to work on me
[1:21:25] on those things so that I'm not always
[1:21:27] trying to think six steps ahead amen
[1:21:31] praise God Amen uh just don't ask any
[1:21:34] questions it's already over so the trial
[1:21:37] was already over when he revealed to me
[1:21:39] last year and I'm going to get into
[1:21:41] testifying what's happened throughout
[1:21:43] this past year but um so it was already
[1:21:46] over
[1:21:47] then amen so it's already over just keep
[1:21:51] going it Masters all circumstan
[1:21:55] Faith believes that God will work it out
[1:21:57] right so that's why I went to testifying
[1:21:59] right away I I told my business advisor
[1:22:02] I told my
[1:22:03] bookkeeper and I told Paul I I was
[1:22:05] telling anybody that anything that came
[1:22:07] up with that type of situation well
[1:22:08] how's it going I'm like well that's
[1:22:10] testify of Psalms 107 it's rough but
[1:22:13] God's going to get me through it amen
[1:22:15] praise God faith believes that God will
[1:22:18] work it out I don't know how he's going
[1:22:20] to do it and that was one of the phrases
[1:22:22] I used I don't know how he's going to do
[1:22:23] it but he's going going to do it amen
[1:22:26] he'll do it anyhow see it Masters all
[1:22:30] circumstances
[1:22:31] amen then we we have the privilege to
[1:22:35] enforce upon Satan the claims that God
[1:22:38] gives us for God has a law and his law
[1:22:41] and his word is a law amen we have a
[1:22:46] right to force these claims upon Satan
[1:22:48] and say give it back and he has to do it
[1:22:52] because we can take God's agent the holy
[1:22:54] spirit and go right down on our knees
[1:22:56] and say it's thus sayith the Lord he's
[1:22:58] got to give it up that's all cu the holy
[1:23:00] spirit is there to make him do it amen
[1:23:04] amen the church has given the rightful
[1:23:07] legal rights by the Bible to take the
[1:23:09] Holy Spirit and force this upon Him amen
[1:23:12] now he is now beginning to feel
[1:23:14] religious now we have a law the law uh
[1:23:17] uh the law of life in us we don't only
[1:23:20] thing we have to do you are made and
[1:23:23] born and placed here in the body Body of
[1:23:24] Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you
[1:23:26] don't have to knock down to the devil
[1:23:29] the only thing you know you have to do
[1:23:31] is know how to let go and let God Amen
[1:23:36] and he's just asking us to surrender
[1:23:39] amen that's what he was asking me to
[1:23:41] surrender the situation to him if I
[1:23:43] reveal to you that I'm going to bring
[1:23:44] something to pass then you can just rest
[1:23:47] assured right he's going to keep those
[1:23:49] in perfect peace amen praise
[1:23:53] God amen just let go and let God that's
[1:23:56] all and the same way it is with us it
[1:23:58] isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry
[1:24:02] that's one of the biggest things that we
[1:24:03] always do is we try to hurry it up amen
[1:24:07] oh I don't uh it says if I don't get
[1:24:10] this if I don't get that that's not it
[1:24:12] is to know that the law of life is in
[1:24:14] you and you just let go and let God Amen
[1:24:18] then he takes you to your healing he
[1:24:21] takes you to the baptism of the spirit
[1:24:23] or anything that he's promised by
[1:24:25] letting go and letting God amen glory
[1:24:28] praise God so just in summary I just
[1:24:30] pulling things out of what brother
[1:24:32] brandom said there on faith so faith is
[1:24:35] the complete trust and confidence in God
[1:24:38] right as simple it is like I if I have
[1:24:41] complete trust and confidence in him I
[1:24:43] completely turn it over to him and
[1:24:46] that's nothing that I'm thinking up in
[1:24:47] myself it's given to me by Revelation
[1:24:51] right it's a gift from God making making
[1:24:54] known to me his Divine will right it's
[1:24:57] nothing that I can work up or work hard
[1:25:00] for right it's a gift it's given by the
[1:25:03] grace of God showing me his Divine will
[1:25:06] not just in word right but given me by
[1:25:10] experience so that it grows within my
[1:25:12] heart amen giving me evidence that is
[1:25:15] not imagined but tangible in substance
[1:25:19] which gives me the authority by Jehovah
[1:25:22] to claim it amen not depending on my
[1:25:25] knowledge to figure out how it will come
[1:25:28] to pass but it gives me full Assurance
[1:25:31] in God Amen which gives me rest peace
[1:25:35] and a calm heart on the finished work of
[1:25:37] God
[1:25:39] Amen so that's what God showed me last
[1:25:42] May that I needed to do in this
[1:25:45] situation so I started testifying like I
[1:25:48] said to my business advisor to my
[1:25:50] bookkeeper um as and again I thought I
[1:25:53] was going to be coming out of this trial
[1:25:56] and that it was already like in the
[1:25:57] midst of the storm little did I know
[1:25:59] that it was going to get much waver the
[1:26:02] waves were going to get a lot higher um
[1:26:05] but again like I used the opportunity to
[1:26:07] praise God and then um I had told my mom
[1:26:09] too my mom's a Believer um I had told my
[1:26:12] mom the previous may as well and she's
[1:26:15] the one who started the company so we we
[1:26:17] we share a lot um so I had told my mom
[1:26:19] about Psalms 107 she goes oh I've been
[1:26:22] meaning to give you something so so my
[1:26:25] grandmother uh who who has passed away
[1:26:28] when she first moved to PA I had bought
[1:26:30] her a picture for her house and I had
[1:26:32] completely forgotten about it she and
[1:26:34] she said Nana I wanted you to have it
[1:26:36] back um after she passed away and I have
[1:26:39] it in in in my house and I want to give
[1:26:42] this she told me to give it to you and
[1:26:44] says you telling me about your
[1:26:46] experience with God in Psalms 107 and
[1:26:48] how he's going to um uh bring you
[1:26:51] through so um the picture that I had
[1:26:54] given her was of a sunset on on the
[1:26:58] ocean and the script there was a
[1:27:00] scripture on the on the um the painting
[1:27:03] itself and the scripture
[1:27:06] was from Psalms
[1:27:08] 107 um and it said that he maketh the
[1:27:12] storm a calm so that the waves thereof
[1:27:14] are still so it's exactly from the
[1:27:18] scripture a right so it's a witness from
[1:27:21] God like he he does little things to
[1:27:23] show you his will and his way so so he's
[1:27:26] confirming his word to be like Yep this
[1:27:28] is what's going to happen and don't fret
[1:27:32] amen praise God amen amen let me get
[1:27:35] back to where I was um so I had told my
[1:27:38] mother and she had given me that picture
[1:27:39] I have that picture hanging up in my
[1:27:41] house now in my study um so I was
[1:27:43] telling anytime I come up against a
[1:27:46] tough time in relation to the business I
[1:27:48] would I would tell people about the
[1:27:49] scripture and how God was going to get
[1:27:51] us through and again we were kind of
[1:27:53] managing you know you know through uh
[1:27:55] cash flow and you know just kind of week
[1:27:56] to week like are you going to be able to
[1:27:57] pay the payroll this week and and so
[1:28:00] forth but you know God was coming
[1:28:01] through and then uh September the very
[1:28:05] beginning of September um I got a call
[1:28:08] from my mom um telling me that so I I
[1:28:12] have three sisters uh my older sister is
[1:28:14] a year older than I am and she's
[1:28:16] handicapped she has William syndrome um
[1:28:18] and she was having stomach trouble they
[1:28:21] took her to the doctor um and then she
[1:28:23] called me from the hospital saying that
[1:28:25] they transfering her to Hershey Medical
[1:28:28] uh they found a mass in her stomach it's
[1:28:31] like a 8 inch Mass uh and it turned out
[1:28:34] to be um ovarian
[1:28:36] cancer um and they had to do an
[1:28:39] operation that week um to try try and uh
[1:28:43] take it out of her uh so they gave her a
[1:28:45] full hysterctomy and and did the surgery
[1:28:48] so talk to Mom again about Psalms 107
[1:28:51] says he tells us to praise him and that
[1:28:53] he's going to bring us through the storm
[1:28:54] so we prayed and I I went in and I
[1:28:57] prayed for my sister and I told prayed
[1:29:00] that the Lord would be with the surgery
[1:29:02] and guide the doctors and and that um
[1:29:04] know God would heal her of the cancer
[1:29:06] and that God would heal her of William
[1:29:08] syndrome because neither one of them is
[1:29:10] is insurmountable to him amen um so he
[1:29:15] had brought her through that surgery um
[1:29:18] and um the the doctors wanted her to go
[1:29:22] for a severe chemo treatment shortly
[1:29:25] after that um and she had just and my
[1:29:28] like I said my sister's handicapped so
[1:29:30] she has probably like a sixth grade
[1:29:31] level um Ed education so uh so she could
[1:29:35] be a bit emotional um she had just seen
[1:29:38] my aunt go through cancer and and pass
[1:29:41] away from it um and seen her go through
[1:29:44] chemo she's like I don't want anything
[1:29:45] to do do with that and we kind of agreed
[1:29:48] that oh that would be really really
[1:29:50] tough for her and it' just be a horrible
[1:29:52] quality of life so she she made the
[1:29:55] decision my older sister and she has
[1:29:57] great faith she's my my sister's a
[1:29:59] wonderful Christian um and she's nope
[1:30:01] God's going to heal me um so she made
[1:30:04] the decision not to go through through
[1:30:05] chemo so they kind of just help helped
[1:30:07] her through that surgery so that was
[1:30:09] like in in September and of course on on
[1:30:12] going and I'll get to more about that
[1:30:14] testimony then in on um November the
[1:30:18] beginning so that was September
[1:30:20] beginning of October the waves got
[1:30:21] higher my my dad um he's battled with
[1:30:25] hepatitis C for a long time and it
[1:30:28] killed his liver um so he was on the
[1:30:31] list for liver transplant so we got a
[1:30:33] phone call um the beginning of of
[1:30:36] October oh somebody died in a car
[1:30:39] accident uh come in get a liver
[1:30:40] transplant so we I took him to the
[1:30:43] hospital that night he had a li liver
[1:30:46] transplant two days later and then now
[1:30:48] we're on that recovery so now my mom's
[1:30:50] dealing with my sister's recovery and my
[1:30:51] dad's recovery um so that was that was
[1:30:55] September that was October and then in
[1:30:58] November um we just had Thanksgiving
[1:31:01] dinner um and that uh that weekend uh my
[1:31:06] SI my I have a my middle sister she's
[1:31:09] nine years younger than me she's married
[1:31:11] um not currently Believers um they were
[1:31:14] on vacation and her husband started
[1:31:16] having issues with his stomach so they
[1:31:18] took him to the hospital they said oh
[1:31:20] you got to we got to get you back so
[1:31:22] they were in Florida and they had to get
[1:31:23] him back up to uh Baltimore and they
[1:31:26] said like you you need to go to the
[1:31:27] hospital right away just get off the
[1:31:29] plane and go to the emergency room um so
[1:31:32] I I I drove down to meet them in
[1:31:35] Baltimore um and he got diagnosed with
[1:31:38] um leukemia uh leukemia and they said if
[1:31:41] we don't start a treatment you're going
[1:31:42] to be dead in two
[1:31:44] weeks um and we were estranged from them
[1:31:48] um at the time uh there was just some
[1:31:51] family family issues so this um I I said
[1:31:54] well my my sister's my family I love her
[1:31:57] um you know regardless of of how he
[1:32:00] feels or how they feel I'm going to go
[1:32:01] down there and show them the love of God
[1:32:03] um and you're just trying to follow the
[1:32:04] leading with the spirit right you're
[1:32:06] really trying to see like okay what does
[1:32:08] he want me to say what does he want me
[1:32:09] to do how do we bridge this Gap right um
[1:32:13] and so I went down there and just showed
[1:32:14] them Christlike love we didn't talk
[1:32:17] about Christ there was no opening to to
[1:32:19] do that um at that time um but I I
[1:32:23] showed them love family love and just
[1:32:27] the love of God um and then I had come
[1:32:29] home and they had to go through
[1:32:32] immediately like severe chemo treatment
[1:32:35] um you know to where he was going to get
[1:32:36] blasted with chemo for like seven
[1:32:38] straight days at 30 times the dose the
[1:32:40] only way he was going to be able to
[1:32:42] survive um and then so he was going
[1:32:45] through that in the middle of that um
[1:32:47] him and my my wife um you know he he
[1:32:50] doesn't mind talking to my wife because
[1:32:52] she's an outsider for the the riddle
[1:32:54] family um and and she she goes through
[1:32:58] her own battles from from a from a
[1:33:00] health standpoint you know my my wife
[1:33:02] has Ms and we're believing for her
[1:33:04] healing and we just know it's just a
[1:33:05] matter of uh when not if right because
[1:33:08] it's it's a promise of God um so he had
[1:33:10] reached out to her and she's like how do
[1:33:12] you how do you deal with impending how
[1:33:15] do you deal with going through this um
[1:33:18] but uh that opened up the door for her
[1:33:21] to testify of how she goes through it
[1:33:24] it's through the grace of God it's
[1:33:25] through Christ so she was able to lead
[1:33:27] him to the Lord you know so all God
[1:33:30] works all things for his glory amen
[1:33:34] praise
[1:33:35] God Amen so that was my family kind of
[1:33:39] going through bun and and I'm I know all
[1:33:42] I praise God just call out to him and
[1:33:45] and make sure I worship and and keep
[1:33:47] quoting Psalms 107 that he's going to
[1:33:49] get us through amen and in the meantime
[1:33:53] through September through December I
[1:33:55] can't even focus on work right I'm just
[1:33:57] relying on my people to to to get us
[1:33:59] through and I can't focus on trying to
[1:34:01] write the ship so I'm just okay God's
[1:34:03] got at the helm right I'm he told me he
[1:34:05] would take care of it so I'm I'm I'm G
[1:34:07] to because right now I'm like sometimes
[1:34:10] he'll put stuff in your life that you
[1:34:12] have to make a choice on what gets
[1:34:14] sacrificed right like you can't do all
[1:34:16] things right and you have to turn over
[1:34:18] and rely stuff on him and do what you
[1:34:21] need to do um so I was just relying on
[1:34:24] God to get us to get us through that um
[1:34:27] and things got kind of dicey at the end
[1:34:29] of the year obviously in construction
[1:34:31] stuff slows down at Thanksgiving
[1:34:33] Christmas nobody wants their house
[1:34:34] worked on during the holidays so it's
[1:34:36] even getting even uh a little bit um the
[1:34:39] waves getting a little bit higher right
[1:34:42] um but I kept testifying and and like I
[1:34:45] said testifying to my bookkeeper and one
[1:34:47] of the comment she made to me was like I
[1:34:49] don't know how I'm going to pay the
[1:34:50] bills this week and then all of a sudden
[1:34:51] you get a check God's always on time my
[1:34:55] dad my dad told me that he's never early
[1:34:58] he's never late though he's always on
[1:35:00] time so by God's grace uh we were able
[1:35:03] to still maintain and stay afloat
[1:35:05] through that through that storm um and
[1:35:09] again like the waves were were super
[1:35:11] high and um I was thinking well maybe
[1:35:13] this is it um and God always does stuff
[1:35:18] that's out of the ordinary so we were
[1:35:20] working with a customer um usually we
[1:35:22] are doing full models um they started as
[1:35:25] a design only um because of a
[1:35:27] relationship with my sister who's a
[1:35:29] designer so like sure we'll do design
[1:35:30] only there's no there's no funds in
[1:35:33] design only so like but I felt the
[1:35:35] leading to do it so we were doing it um
[1:35:38] and then that turns out to be the
[1:35:40] largest cabinet deal that we've ever
[1:35:43] made in in our lives the largest cabinet
[1:35:45] deal for the C for the uh cabinet
[1:35:47] company that we work with um and I'm
[1:35:49] thinking well is this it is we we're
[1:35:52] going to go through the desired port at
[1:35:53] this point all it did was bring us
[1:35:56] current right it didn't it didn't even
[1:35:58] get me I'm like okay I guess the storm's
[1:36:01] not over this again and this was in
[1:36:03] January um and again just keep praying
[1:36:05] and keep every day testifying like I
[1:36:08] said we're I'm in a a business men's
[1:36:09] group and it's a it's christian-based um
[1:36:12] so we meet once a month and you always
[1:36:14] give an update of how you're doing so
[1:36:16] keep testifying Psalms 107 um that God's
[1:36:20] going to bring us through um and then
[1:36:23] stuff start started to to look a little
[1:36:24] bit better and a little bit better um
[1:36:27] and I was like okay is is this it so uh
[1:36:31] we we had signed a bunch of deals to
[1:36:33] kind of get us back up to a good level
[1:36:35] and I was it's review time at work right
[1:36:39] you got to do peer reviews and such um
[1:36:41] and planning for the next year and I
[1:36:44] hadn't been I wasn't able to do bonuses
[1:36:46] or uh raises for the past two years just
[1:36:48] because of how crazy it was and um so we
[1:36:52] were just deing to do it this year and
[1:36:54] it was just starting to look good and I
[1:36:56] I put together um a presentation um and
[1:37:00] God always like I said he'll show you
[1:37:03] when it's time like you know like when
[1:37:05] things start and he'll show you when
[1:37:06] it's going to end so you know I'm
[1:37:08] praying is is this is this the it Lord
[1:37:11] or you know we you have you brought me
[1:37:13] through and I like I said I prepared the
[1:37:16] presentation for the employees and it
[1:37:17] was the day of the presentation and I'm
[1:37:20] just praying in the morning um about it
[1:37:23] and I'm going through uh reading the
[1:37:25] Bible in a year um and I'm doing it on
[1:37:27] on a app that that does it
[1:37:29] chronologically I've never done it that
[1:37:30] way right so it's not in order of how
[1:37:32] you see here it's going to do it based
[1:37:34] upon when things are happening
[1:37:36] chronologically so I have no idea what
[1:37:38] scripture is going to be next um and
[1:37:41] then that morning Psalms when was
[1:37:44] happening amen so I praise God um he
[1:37:48] that he has taken us through amen so
[1:37:51] Isaiah 26 says Thou will keep him in
[1:37:54] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:37:57] thee because he trusteth in thee trust
[1:38:00] ye in the Lord forever for the Lord
[1:38:02] Jehovah is Everlasting strength and I
[1:38:04] dove into the scripture a little bit
[1:38:06] deeper um and to where I can really uh
[1:38:10] look at the con context because it says
[1:38:12] Jehovah will keep us in perfect peace
[1:38:14] it's not nothing that I'm doing it's
[1:38:15] something that he's going to do for us
[1:38:18] amen and the word for keep in the
[1:38:21] scripture is toore uh which is uh in its
[1:38:25] semetic root is the idea of guarding
[1:38:27] over or watching over so it's not so
[1:38:30] much that he's giving you he's not
[1:38:31] giving us perfect peace because he is
[1:38:34] perfect peace he's keeping us in perfect
[1:38:37] peace amen so he's watching over us in
[1:38:40] perfect peace amen right and it's like
[1:38:43] um this is the way it is with God is we
[1:38:46] Face a frightening situation or crisis
[1:38:48] we are fearful worried and we go to God
[1:38:50] and he says hey I'm in control it's okay
[1:38:54] and then you know what it's suddenly
[1:38:55] okay right so it's like Psalms 107 God
[1:38:58] giving me that you're going to go
[1:39:00] through this but I'm going to take you
[1:39:01] through well then then you can rest in
[1:39:04] perfect peace amen he says I will keep
[1:39:07] uh he will keep us in perfect peace and
[1:39:09] there's no word in Hebrew for
[1:39:12] perfect um and we all know the word for
[1:39:14] peace is Shalom so it's shalom twice so
[1:39:19] it's shalom shalom right like so
[1:39:21] whenever something said twice in the
[1:39:23] Bible it means pay attention right so it
[1:39:26] is simply the word Shalom repeated two
[1:39:28] times right so he's going to keep us in
[1:39:30] shalom shalom amen um he says but the
[1:39:34] it's the best peace God himself is at
[1:39:37] perfect peace or he is he is peace now
[1:39:39] the word Shalom has wide range in
[1:39:41] meetings it's not doesn't only mean rest
[1:39:44] it also means healing it means safety it
[1:39:47] means security amen he says but we must
[1:39:51] keep in mind that he is perfect peace
[1:39:54] the way we gain access to this piece is
[1:39:56] by having our minds stayed on him amen
[1:40:00] amen now the word mind in Hebrew uh that
[1:40:04] is used here is yees R yes sir um this
[1:40:08] is a sort um a play on the word keep um
[1:40:13] but it's it's spelled well just jump
[1:40:15] past that um it's a represents a humble
[1:40:18] submission to the Holy Spirit the word
[1:40:20] yeser comes from the semetic root used
[1:40:22] for imagination
[1:40:24] amen so uh hence God will guard over our
[1:40:28] imaginations with perfect peace amen
[1:40:31] because where does much of our Stress
[1:40:34] and Anxiety come from right it's our own
[1:40:36] imaginations and thinking right like
[1:40:38] fear comes from what we think will
[1:40:41] happen right amen but if he's going to
[1:40:44] guard over our imaginations with perfect
[1:40:47] peace so God will keep in perfect peace
[1:40:51] our imaginations are stayed on him
[1:40:54] now the word stayed is Sak which is like
[1:40:57] a mattress covering it is an overlay so
[1:41:01] when our imaginations cover god um his
[1:41:05] peace will become our peace his
[1:41:07] imaginations will become our
[1:41:08] imaginations right Philippians 2:5 says
[1:41:11] let the mind be in you which also was in
[1:41:13] Christ amen praise God says yet this
[1:41:17] verse is not saying that God will give
[1:41:19] us perfect peace it is saying that he
[1:41:21] will keep guard or watch over us in
[1:41:24] perfect peace it is saying that his that
[1:41:27] he is perfect peace and he will guard or
[1:41:29] watch over this perfect peace that we
[1:41:32] receive when we take our imaginations
[1:41:34] and overlay them with his we get this
[1:41:37] perfect peace when we let our
[1:41:38] imaginations become one with God's
[1:41:41] imaginations what scripture does that
[1:41:43] sound like sounds like Philippians 4
[1:41:46] right so Paul was referring to Isaiah 26
[1:41:49] when he talked about Philippians 4 so
[1:41:52] let's read Philippians 4
[1:41:54] four says rejoice in the lord always and
[1:41:57] again I say rejoice let your moderation
[1:42:00] be known unto all men the Lord is at
[1:42:02] hand be careful for nothing but in
[1:42:05] everything by prayer and supplication
[1:42:07] with Thanksgiving right oh that I wish
[1:42:10] that men would praise the Lord with
[1:42:12] Thanksgiving let your requests be known
[1:42:14] unto God and and the peace of God Amen
[1:42:19] which pass all understanding shall keep
[1:42:22] your hearts and mind Minds through
[1:42:24] Christ Jesus why finally Brethren
[1:42:27] whatsoever things are true so this now
[1:42:29] we're talking about our imaginations
[1:42:30] right whichever things are true
[1:42:32] whichever things are honest whichever
[1:42:34] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:42:36] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:42:38] whatsoever things are a good report if
[1:42:40] there be any virtue and if there be any
[1:42:43] praise think on these things whose mind
[1:42:47] is stayed on thee right those things
[1:42:50] which have you both learned and received
[1:42:53] and heard and see in me do and the God
[1:42:56] of Peace shall be with you amen so that
[1:43:00] does tales with Isaiah 26 amen says but
[1:43:04] I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now
[1:43:07] at the last you your care of me hath
[1:43:11] flourished again wherein ye were also
[1:43:13] careful but ye lacked opportunity here
[1:43:16] this is what I wanted to get to not that
[1:43:17] I speak in respect of want right so what
[1:43:20] happens when we're in perfect peace with
[1:43:21] God when we let go and let God um I know
[1:43:27] I speak in respect of want for I have
[1:43:29] learned and whatsoever State I
[1:43:32] am um therefore to be content right
[1:43:36] because I've surrendered it to God so
[1:43:39] even though I'm going to go through this
[1:43:40] great storm or if you're in prison or if
[1:43:43] you're bound in in in sickness right if
[1:43:46] God has revealed to you that he's all
[1:43:48] you have to do is cry out to him and
[1:43:51] worship him and he's going to deliver
[1:43:53] deliver you then I know that I have
[1:43:56] learned in whatsoever State I am
[1:43:58] therefore to be content I know no I I
[1:44:01] know both how to be abased and I know
[1:44:04] how to abound everywhere and in all
[1:44:07] things I am instructed both to be full
[1:44:10] and to be hungry both to abound and to
[1:44:12] suffer need I can do all things through
[1:44:16] Christ Jesus which strengths strengthens
[1:44:18] me amen praise
[1:44:21] God thank you Jesus
[1:44:24] thank you Lord all right praise God I'm
[1:44:26] going to I'm going to wind it down here
[1:44:27] I didn't want to be long tonight um I'm
[1:44:30] going to go to um this is from unfailing
[1:44:34] realities of the Living
[1:44:36] God God wants you to
[1:44:39] surrender God wants a complete surrender
[1:44:42] when you surrender everything then you
[1:44:44] will find out what I'm talking about is
[1:44:46] the truth I've often thought what why
[1:44:51] how we've deprived ourselves how we've
[1:44:53] robbed God of his plan by not
[1:44:56] surrendering Our Lives completely to him
[1:44:59] everything that we have to him how that
[1:45:02] we have um disallowed his program we've
[1:45:06] lingered and have made him to wait and
[1:45:09] wait and wait trying to find somebody
[1:45:11] that he could work through trying to
[1:45:13] find a man somewhere that he could put
[1:45:16] confidence in some man that would
[1:45:18] surrender
[1:45:19] everything amen so this is saying if we
[1:45:24] do what Psalms 107 says Where We Praise
[1:45:27] Him and we cry out to him whatever
[1:45:30] situation that we're in and then we
[1:45:32] surrender it we trust it to him this is
[1:45:34] what will happen says like we should
[1:45:37] come in a sane sensible way to God
[1:45:39] saying Father Here I Am I don't care I'm
[1:45:42] going to follow the scripture the
[1:45:44] blueprint I don't care what anybody else
[1:45:46] says I stay with it I really mean it I
[1:45:49] don't care what it costs me Lord I'm
[1:45:52] nothing to begin with but I want you to
[1:45:54] lead me and let the holy spirit that
[1:45:57] wrote this Bible and made these promises
[1:45:59] confirm it back through my life I feel
[1:46:02] that you're leading me that way he says
[1:46:04] stay on the highway stay on the road map
[1:46:07] go the way the disciples went go the
[1:46:10] word uh go the word they preached live
[1:46:13] it amen testify it I know it to be the
[1:46:16] truth God has to find somebody that he
[1:46:19] can trust somebody that he can uh have
[1:46:23] confidence in and can have confidence in
[1:46:25] God that can believe him you believe
[1:46:28] that don't you sure God has to find
[1:46:31] somebody who can put his confidence in
[1:46:33] and then when he finds such a man he can
[1:46:36] put his confidence and his power in a
[1:46:39] man that will follow the road that will
[1:46:40] stay right on the map see go right on
[1:46:43] until he comes to the place of power
[1:46:46] faith will lead him to that because he's
[1:46:48] got faith in the word it will lead him
[1:46:51] to the promise and then the promise will
[1:46:53] lead him to
[1:46:54] power amen that's the way God wants us
[1:46:58] to know his word we know it we've
[1:47:01] traveled it and we've tested it we've
[1:47:03] tried it and you know where it leads now
[1:47:06] his road map is the Bible the Bible is
[1:47:09] the road that leads to the power of God
[1:47:12] faith leads you to the power power
[1:47:14] produces the promise and he says we need
[1:47:16] the power but the holy spirit will bring
[1:47:18] you back to Pentecost every time amen
[1:47:21] glory it'll bring you to that reality it
[1:47:24] will bring you back to a baptism of the
[1:47:26] power of the spirit that will lead you
[1:47:28] and will never take one word off the
[1:47:30] Bible amen it'll stay right in the Bible
[1:47:33] where it says this it'll follow right
[1:47:36] through it the holy spirit will it
[1:47:38] brings a reality amen so he's asking us
[1:47:40] to surrender his will so you can come on
[1:47:42] M musicians can come on up I'm going to
[1:47:45] close out with this he says let us
[1:47:47] surrender our will says oh that uh this
[1:47:50] is sorry this is for me let us surrender
[1:47:53] our will this ISS oh that men would
[1:47:55] praise the Lord for his goodness and for
[1:47:57] his wonderful Works to the children of
[1:47:59] men amen says we will observe we will
[1:48:03] observe these things and we will see and
[1:48:05] understand the loving kindness the
[1:48:06] amazing grace of God right if we keep
[1:48:08] our mind on him we'll understand the
[1:48:10] amazing grace of God because he's going
[1:48:12] to take us through that trial so that we
[1:48:15] can have a personal experience of his
[1:48:17] Amazing Grace amen and so in our lives
[1:48:21] we will have perfect peace shalom shalom
[1:48:24] right so you can weather any storm any
[1:48:26] trial any sickness any prison all we
[1:48:30] have to do is cry out to him he wants to
[1:48:32] bring us through and build our faith
[1:48:34] through a partnership and give uh give
[1:48:37] to us his perfect peace shalom shalom so
[1:48:41] I pray that this was a blessing to you
[1:48:42] that it could help you in your work walk
[1:48:44] with Christ um because he wants each to
[1:48:47] give each one of us a personal
