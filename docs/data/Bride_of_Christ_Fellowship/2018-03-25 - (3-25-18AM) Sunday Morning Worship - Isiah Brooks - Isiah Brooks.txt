believe that we're going to get right on into the word we thank the Lord for our musician by God's grace appreciate the invite and welcoming for the Jesse and his family we are just here to do the will of the Lord and if we would turn to two passes of scripture proverbs three and then we'll come from Matthew proverbs three and five six Matthew six nine through eleven preach this message at my church and I trust it will be a blessing to you all by God's grace this message was a powerful revelation to me it may be simple to you and maybe you have this revelation already but I like to share with you that a brother and I were just talking on the phone and we were dealing with the beginning of time what took place there and I saw something that I had never seen before and perhaps it will be God will give you what he gave me because it actually changed my life proverbs 3 through 5 I'm sorry proverbs third chapter fifth verse trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path Matthew 6:9 through 10 after this manner therefore pray II our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven let us pray father we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace and your mercy we pray father God that you would bless O God the service in a special way I pray that you will just open our hearts and understanding to what you would have us to see and to know and understand Lord we commit the service in your hand in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I wanted to do to deal with the will the will the will of man versus will of God when I was talking with my friend from South Carolina I was thinking about the way it must have been in heaven before Lucifer decided to think or to receive or to give thought to his own will before he allowed this darkness to come into him himself there was only one will respected and that was the will of the all-mighty God the angels at that point or before that time knew nothing other than the will of God I don't know how long a time that was but whatever God wanted is what they did there was no questioning to his authority there was no questioning to his word nor his will whatever he would require of them they did it heaven was unified heaven was beautiful and there was no Wars or any type of strife between the Angels and understand Amen that one thought one wheel that was contrary to God's will was found in Satan's heart according to Isaiah 14 the Bible tells us in the 13th verse for thou have said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the North I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High God yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit and we find out that it was so powerful that Lucifer had not even spoken the things that were in his heart so you understand that the word has always been the word and the word has always been a discerner God discerned what was in Lucifer's heart emptied the God discerned what was in his heart the Bible doesn't tell us how long it took Musha fer to spread his lie but however long it took him we understand that there was a third of heaven a harmony you know angels were deceived by his lie and his lie had to be somewhat on the same why's that he told Eve there was a life there's something greater than this and God is hiding it from you they had no idea that they were already in the perfect position that God had already intended them to be in but for some reason they fell to the lie of Satan Lucifer desire has always been to conquer God and to exalt himself above God and we find out that brother Branham said that even in this day here are what are they're speaking of Lucifer has achieved this is Satan's Eden he has exalted himself above the stars of God because remember all things are of God is that right and we realize Amen that the reason what makes us different is because we stood with God in the beginning when Lucifer was making his campaign in heaven brother Branham tells us that we stood with God then and because we stood with God then God stands with us now and you and I must understand by God's grace we stood because we loved his will we understood amen who he was in relationship to us in other words and then we we know by God's grace that there was no such thing as selfishness in heaven and to Lucifer exalted himself and selfishness is someone or some one who's devoted to or caring only for oneself concerned primarily with one's own interests benefits welfare etc regardless of others selfishness is not a great attribute to have and we find out that when people are selfish they seem to be blind to others needs and Lucifer could care less on the results of his selfishness even now he cares for no one but himself there is no love in him he cannot love so therefore everyone that serves him will serve him on the false pretense he could never love them but it is his whole thought is to be greater than God when we talk about will all of us have wheels God made us a free moral agent and God will never stop your will and I when I read the scripture there in in in Matthew where Jesus was praying I love that thought where he says not my will but thine be done see it takes us back to the beginning Lucifer followed his own will but you and I who were predestinated and our names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life we chose to follow God's will and because we follow God's will then we will follow his will now we look at these things and God God God I love the way God assures us because our salvation is not a hope so it is a no so and that's why Paul tells us make your calling and election sure I like that it is it is terrible to try to build upon hope feel something on hope because hope not really promising but when it comes to faith faith is a promise now we talked about we land and you know it's that part of us that is that consciousness that's conscience you know of our actions you know it's something that is a deliberate something we do deliberately it's something we process y'all know what I'm saying when there's an obstacle of when there is something um challenging before you you have to make a decision and your decision will be if wise will be a conscious decision and whatever that your will is to do you're going to do it whether it's good or bad alright that's what what happened to us when we ate off the tree of the knowledge of good and evil God gave us from that point on one choice is to make whether good or bad before then he says you'll be all right except the day that you eat of that tree that tree where you will allow your will to go against my will see Satan himself at that point in time was that tree he was that individual listened that was influenced and Eve and he began to talk with her amen and he allowed he began to build something in her so that she could see you got a will even though he told you don't either that tree you still can eat of it and surely you will not die but he didn't tell apart or to Eve that he was kicked out because of his will and you find out amen she fell for that and then she because she and then fell for his trick trickery she became the tree of death is that right those every man that's born of a woman what she'll surely die in other words we were born into death because of Eve and Adams failure to do I stay with the will of God and let me tell you something God will always place you in a position where you must make a choice we said what brother looks worthy where are you going with this I thought Lord every hardship basically that I have experienced in my life has been because of my own will I mean I mean as a Christian because we have the word and we know the word but yet he will not make us we still may have to make a choice every day what what we're going to do with it I'm so glad that Oh Lord I'm trying not to get too excited as I said Satan introduced selfishness and every time you make a sin it's because you are being selfish every time we falter what you mean brother was when you choose to do evil over good you don't just affect yourself you affect the whole body of Christ Oh somebody help me that's right he said Oh what do you mean let's just go to a Lillis tration we had a can it can was told don't say nothing kill everything and guess what he did he chose to hide a few inches and garments in his place and guess what over 3,000 I believe died because of his will because he chose to do wall or evil others died because of it brother Brown said even in a church if there's hidden sin in the church and then it will cause the church to die God is the saying he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah no other thoughts there was no other thoughts outside of God's thoughts there was no other works there you know God's worked amen except when Lucifer thought in his heart and then I will Excel I will be like the Most High God and remember in this last day the Bible said that he will be sitting on the throne acting and pretending like he is God now we're looking at the throne in in Rome but don't you understand that's not the throne God is talking about the real throne is your heart and right now in this day Lucifer is setting on the hearts of many people pretending to be the Holy Ghost right and that's why it's so important it meant to have the real pedigree Holy Ghost rah because the real Holy Ghost will always direct you back to the word it will never allow you to join up yourself with a creed or Dogma or some kind of authorization it'll never even cause you to turn your back on the Holy Ghost in an ever caused you to turn your back on the people of God we are not created for this worldly system this worldly system is contrary to the true believer there's nothing in this world we should love or desire it is it is it is vexing most of that time just to live in this place is that right I mean it's unless you're blind everything we see and then outside of this house amen is all contrary everything you gotta be really careful because Satan is a wise adversary hallelujah is that right he knows how to bring not only just a dish a distraction but he also knows how to grab you with an objection I'm getting the tongue twister but when you think about you so I would never do that I would never betray Christ oh I never will betray him there's no way think about it we don't know how long Lucifer were with was with God no doubt saw him face to face about says no man I've seen God but Lucifer was not so much a man he was an angel he was a chair of him he was a covering angel he saw things that perhaps we were not natural eyes could never see and yet he walked away from God hallelujah brother branham said he wasn't a son had he been a son he would have been a creator hallelujah and you must understand that God's grace amen that that's what makes us different our origin you can't go to heaven unless you came from heaven and if you came from Hell there's no way you can go to heaven you say brother what are you saying you and I ought to thank God for the seed that God placed in us before the foundation of the world it is the only thing that makes us different from the serpent is the seed God she placed in us why because we will to obey his will in the beginning I'm getting happy here you said what do you mean brother books DC because we have contact with God because we can feel in some time and because we've seen as miraculous does it make a seed hella millions came out of Egypt saw the signs and the wonders a man but don't you know millions were not of God you saw her brother mistake they they were the children of God only by flesh but when it came to the soul only two out of that generation were true seeds because I asked the Lord I said Lord how on earth Amen that you you destroyed all those the Lord loveth them that are hears and knoweth them that are his and he said that's true because they were the shock they were just the carriers of the seed forget it every type fits what was Pentecost many of them will just carry us of the seed come on somebody look at what we got now many of them were carriers of the seed brother Bayless say you wait to that spiritual bride come on the scene spiritual bride the only thing that makes the spiritual is the Holy Ghost what's that group of people that love the Holy Ghost hallelujah those who know that he's the same yesterday today and forever those who know that he is their father I love that because Jesus said our Father when he said our that means he had other brothers and sisters somewhere hallelujah we'll come on somebody we were born of him and because we're born of him how can we not do his will though we be pressured don't we be tried as her brother was what are you saying watch Jesus he was our true example the I'm said in him he's with the word the Word was with God and the Word was God him in the Bible said he took on the human flesh he humbled himself like a man he became a servant hallelujah even unto death that means with all the pressure of all the sins in the world and then laid upon his back he still had a battle he still had a choice and he could have said no I'm not going to do it hallelujah thank God he didn't hallelujah when it came down amen to the pressure and to his choosing he labored do you really think as a man as a fleshly man knowing what Kaveri was going to bring that he really wanted his fashion I don't want to do it father would you have this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will oh I love it I love it because even so when you do the will of God it's not always a joyous thing it may bring you right down to your death right down to the chopping block hallelujah but at that time you must say Lord not my will but thine be done yo hear what I'm saying we want to do the will of God not what we think that's why brother Li got a quote but I'll just go ahead and preach it he said listen you and I must not just die but we must rock it took me a long while to understand that that means all of self must disappear all of self must disappear it must not just die because when you die you still got corpse but when it rots hallelujah is no longer identify has it the identity anymore identifiable it's no longer identifiable what it is and who it is and what was it in soul if it the longest dead and the long it rots sometimes left is a few ashes hallelujah and God wants a seat we can't be part super and part natural if I be understand what I mean when I say that I mean gods don't wanna rassle with your wheel you're supposed to be dead and a dead man has the wheel you can kick him you can stop them you can say whatever you want to him and he'll never ask you with you with the word you'll never see an expression on his face that he does not approve of what you're saying who help us Jesus hallelujah when your dad and when your rotted Amen you got an understanding man that God has you right where he wants you because now you did and he can live take powerful example Paul said is not I that live but Christ lives in me you know that's the kind of testimony I need I've got to have hallelujah why because Paul will say I have died to myself how many of you all he then would have been stoned hallelujah got up and the resurrection got up my goodness a man in Israel let me go preach some more oh hey man how many times did he do about two or three times Paul was resurrected he said I still got a job to do amen that was because Paul was dead to himself and all he wanted to do was the will of God the will of God will cause you to forsake mother father sister brother everybody but him it's your truth you think about those disciples they weren't because they were had been with him God said come follow me some quit their job immediately you understand me but when you know the will of God amen there is no processing is that right when you know the will of God you don't have to think about it you know it yeah somebody must know what I'm talking about when you know the will of God you just do it you don't even know how you know it you just know it you know why because my sheep heareth my voice oh I thought about priests that not long ago I said that voice will call you that voice will find you hallelujah that voice will expose you hallelujah ha because you belong to the voice is that right it made when Adam and Eve sinned and it's about said the voice of God walk to the cool of the evening huh what was that voice doing said Adam Adam where right now God knew what they were hallelujah but God wanted amen them to know and understand this voice is not only your God but this voice is your shelter this God is this voice is your Savior hallelujah this voice is your protector hallelujah this voice it meant that you heard all of these years I have along the time it was Amen is your Creator and the voice said it to Adam who told you you were naked that's one of those those serpents these scriptures who not what but who told you so we realize it man that voice is missing who toe he didn't say you weren't know you naked but who told you right and what God was trying to get out of them was that they could see what their will was how corrupt they had become because all Adam had to do is say Lord it's me I am guilty but because they had eaten off of the tree they didn't want to be exposed they didn't want the blame on them and they said that's woman you gave me and he at that moment in time God had sure was showing Adam amen the corruption of his heart way is hard now was standing when you are a tree the Bible said the real tree is a good tree you can't have building sweet coming out of the same fountain he said either make them found in sweet or bitter it has to be that way it can't be two kinds of water coming out of one fountain it must be one one must die in order for the other to live y'all hear what I'm saying I'm talking about see we're working with rapture material and the only way that we'll ever be wrapped to see because God is never going to ever have another Lucifer the time period of Lucifer is now and God is using Lucifer as a tuturro for us to train us to make us know the difference between good and evil hallelujah because after this there never be another day of evil y'all hear what I'm saying so you say what do you mean brother books I'm trying to tell you use your will check your wheel when it comes to anything and everything check your wheel is your wheel lining up with the will of God now the louia think about it if they're all Brotherhood's what are you saying I'm saying betrayal come because of your wheel when you betray trailers to be unfaithful or in guarding or maintaining or fulfilling to betray trusts right but it is to disappoint the hopes or expectations are right in other words if you law you if you have a law your friend you don't want to betray that friend by your will to reveal or disclose in violation of confidence you've told someone something and you just got to tell it right he's just got to tell it but you know not to tell it but your will says though I got to tell it that's betrayal Alleluia and you've done that not because the devil made you do it you did because you will to do it hello some honey and man is that right brother branham said your greatest enemy is not the devil as you you're the enemy I might be his enemy why because I have a will I love it when Jesus was about to go into Calvary of finished uh go to the cross and and he says father not my will but thine be done that we look at that like that was so light to say but the whole sin is sin in a work you know what I'm saying whip wood cattails according to history and plugs are flesh being pulled out of human you know all those things and people spit in your face and slapping you and everything else y'all know what I'm saying you said what do you mean even when the Holy Ghost tells you go talk to somebody about Jesus you got a battle between God's will and your will is that right oh I don't want them to hurt my feelings you see that selfishness when God has suffered all the pain of your sins and you can't even suffer a little bit of pain because you're talking about him his will versus your wheel are we staying in his will Oh Lord I was telling my son one of my son's I said you got to understand I said even if you're not living it you need to tell those who you say you're your friend you need to tell them the truth what if they died on you and you know you knew the truth but you didn't tell them because your wheel didn't want you to have your feelings hurt you didn't want to be rejected even though he was rejected you see what I'm saying but we say we in cars but we don't act like Christ when it comes to certain things that's contrary to our will that is why your will must die this is why you must die this is why you may rock because I'm gonna tell you something that influence that that that pride that comes with your will was given to you at birth yeah he was lifted up Satan was huh pride was found in him he didn't want to be a servant no more and that's the way it is even in charge like I tell people I said what is it that you don't want to worship God what is it you don't want to clap your hand what is it that you want to raise your voice what is it that you're afraid to dance in the spirit hallelujah is your will it ain't gods where the Bible said that's what we supposed to be doing Bob says rejoice always and again I say rejoice is your will here's what I'm not emotional that's Allah everybody's emotional if you're not emotional you're dead ooh I guarantee you I came in and slap your face you get emotional if you're not dead I can expect a response right [Laughter] because I would never do such a thing as that but my point is people said I'm not emotional like I had that supposed to tell me I'm not emotional in one day I called her first father bought a brand new ride lawnmower she didn't even know I was at the house and she loved to cut the grass and she was out there screaming holla I just looked at her like hmm I got you now did I preach it yeah I preached I didn't call her name but I preached it well I mean it is the devil that makes you think you're not emotional when it comes to God what it is people are ashamed that's the truth of it you're a shame because you don't know how he gonna make you act come on somebody is the truth and we don't even understand that when we sit down on God we're betraying him you're not gonna find the devil worship was out there sitting down on God you ever seen those constructs oh they dance be sure but they don't dance they dance in the spirit it ain't in God's Spirit but they in this right there is the devil spirit and they do it they dance they do whatever the devil say do if the devil say step turn on your head and everything else he'll do it we get in the church and we all pious hmm oh you don't need all of that no you don't you really don't but I think if people understood how good a person felt but when they danced in the spirit everybody be out in the floor yeah it's the truth you know people's well I don't believe they're about that there's no everybody don't because in their natural selves there are those like I said in their natural selves this is what God did God took a staunch group of Jews put him up in the upper room fill him with the Holy Ghost and they were running down the street screaming he's alive he's alive is that what brother him said oh yes the truth he said they were jumping out of windows laughs that ain't the whole egos I don't know what it is and how long it's been since you have seen the Holy Ghost break a heart and somebody's crying we've gotten so into a place in man that we allow I will do you feel they're not that come you want to cry but you're saying because you're afraid of what somebody else may say oh you might draw attention hallelujah all I know is my God said put your light upon us cat somewhere it could be seen don't hide it under a bushel I don't make had you don't hide your experience on the religion but this is not how the message people worship what misses people you're not a part of the message until Christ is in you is that right you're a real believer you go all the way to the Holy Ghost all the way no matter what it takes you go all the way is this okay but I'll never betray them look at Judas Judas wint was hit three and a half years face-to-face talk with him aid at the table and everything else as soon as that time came for him to betray him he did it why it was the seed that was in him he was the son of perdition hallelujah oh come on somebody I shall thank God for this message because this message uncovers this message tells us it shows us exactly where we are y'all hear what I'm saying you can't fake it in here because the Word of God will surely excellence' not just you me too I realized Amen I'm laying naked before God I'm open before God you know when I get to pray and then I don't know what I must say this I'm I'm I'm on the experience but you know you know in that old denominational Church we should say Lord forgive me of my known and unknown sins are you talking about if you got the Holy Ghost you know your sins not only God told you before you did it don't do it right it's a truth that's what mine that's what haha right but your will overrides it now I was telling the brothers church I say y'all notice the truth the devil say do it do it and then as soon as you do it he say you so stupid and look what you gotta do yeah you gotta make it right now now you say all Brotherhood's what are you saying think about it and all of that anointing I'm gonna show you how your will can just creep up on you and you don't even know that you deceive or you don't even know that you out of the will of God take a take for an example Ananias and Sapphira and then they saw their goods for whatever money they showed it right it was theirs they didn't even have to give it to God they had the charge to keep it or to give it and the devil said you know that's too much money to be putting in church that's too much money at least take some of it and just tell them this is what you pay for it so this is what you give it it to the reason to the reasoning it may have seemed logical but it was of the devil because it was just that much off of the truth y'all hear them say and their will did what caused them to die because they created a lie walk in the lie and got caught in the line so what I'm saying is that's just your real God don't mandate things on you sometimes we we let me tell you something God did not make this salvation how can I say it long this is the message of grace you make it long like Israel made it long y'all hear them saying because I believe if a person get the Holy Ghost a lot of the things that being taught in the church would not even be necessary because the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth is that right it is the truth but we are making a law Amen we don't have the Holy Ghost we don't have a revelation of what we need to do and then we're fashion ourselves pretending to be something god never asks you to pretend God told you to get born again cuz once you born again you don't have to pretend to be part of everybody else but we'll do that because we don't want everybody to look at us and judge us is your will again and don't put that on God y'all hear what I'm saying you look at this thing you said oh Jesus said you got to recognize something who are you and where did you come from and I always tell people there is no way I came from hell I things about God when I was a child didn't even know him and God was on my mind nobody told me that God was one I went to a Baptist Church and I knew that God was one my first time here in a woman preach I knew it was wrong nobody told me that but election something on the inside of me made me know that certain things were not right even before I came to God I was able to see what was right and what was wrong some of those things y'all understand me I was not one and maybe you say well what do you mean why are you saying this listen the Bible said in John eight and I'm gonna move on 23 to 24 he said unto them ye are from beneath high and from above here of the world I am NOT up this world see when you not of this world you cannot love the things of the world you can't you can't love the things of the world when you're not of this world once you are born again truly born again the world is way off somewhere somewhere somewhere from you hey man you're not even thinking about it love not the things that were why because you've been born from a different city you've been born from a different place hallelujah right is that the word brother branham said if you was a pig how you going to condemn a pig for being a pig P go like pig things right he said a sinner a sinner is a sinner he's not condemned because he's a sinner he's a pig but when you're born again and you claim to be a Christian now he said the Christian can say hmmm the Christian can send a minute when we do and then we do we don't worry about it because we have an advocate we've got a solution to our problems but I don't believe a sin uh-uh when a sinner when a Christian sin or come short and I know the reality of it is once you truly get the seal of God you cannot sin we know that but what i'm saying i'm working with actions now those things that calls us to say Lord forgive me you see what I'm saying she you and I we is our precept this evening the lord tirion assurance but my thing is I was telling somebody I was telling his brother Jesse I said you know what I don't worry about making no rapture this message guaranteed me to rapture when I got the Holy Ghost when God gave me the Holy Ghost signed sealed and delivered already sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus Oh Lord you think when you think your righteousness gonna get you to heaven oh if I just did right if I just do right you can't live right and you can't do right without God on the inside hallelujah and none of us shall make 100 until Jesus say it's a hundred you understand me it's accounted to us as a hundred it's given to us as a hundred if you want to say it like that ah because Jesus Christ is the only man that made the hundred he was the only perfect man let me let me say it like this you know these things but listen there is no holy mountain unless the Holy Ghost is on the mountain there's no holy water unless God is in the water there's no holy man unless God is in the man it ain't you it's a holy God that makes you holy that's why he said be holy for I am holy the Lord you cannot be holy not on your own not in self righteousness whoo and that's why the people will uh I don't know whether I won't this holy goes I like I try to tell people this you don't know how good this Apple tastes until you bite it if I got Apple in my hand and I'm crunching it and you could smell it oh and it smells so good and you can almost taste its flavors from the scent but you'll never know how good it is until you bite into it that's how it is with God you don't know how good it is I I was when I was a boy actually see the holy goes to church people like that I used to be afraid of it because it looked like it hurt oh my god well when I got it myself oh it jerked me wherever it wanted to jerking it was there every time it judge me it was really good now it doesn't have to jerk everybody everybody don't jerk don't get me wrong I'm not trying to put who's the doctrine of jerking but my point is the joy of the Lord so feels your fibers of your being to your body sometimes don't even know how to react have you ever had you know you're just thinking about the Lord Jesus and all of a sudden the hallelujah come out of your mouth you use somewhere else and you're not even Church all over hallelujah you know you think about it praise the Lord it is because that joy is only inside there's a tabernacle that you are the tabernacle there's a worship going on all the time the greatest way you can worship God is to fulfill his will is that okay see my kingdom jesus said is not of this world if his kingdom is not of this world neither is mine neither is yours is that right he said if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence Pilate said unto them o thou a king then hallelujah I like that I'm I asked you a question are you a king absolutely the Bible said when we come into Christ he has made us both kings and priests Oh sister said well I can't be a king because I'm a female well I can't be a queen because I'm y'all didn't get it I'm calling myself bride but I'm a man if I can call myself bride you can call yourself King ah because you must understand it is the king that's in you that makes you a king oh we must we must we must be selfless we must become self less and you said what brother Brooks and that's what I've been asking the Lord to help me help me become selfless and sometimes we do that even in our texting sometimes people may say or do something something and then all of a sudden that will of yours jump up and you're gonna text this and then the Holy Ghost says uh-uh don't do that then you go erase erase erase erase erase and then you might say a few words of kindness who did that that cop that's God that's God you just denied your will that God's will be done and because God's will be done you have kept peace because you know the text would have brought war you denied yourself even if you felt like you were right you still denied yourself is that okay we lost you so what do you mean brother and said eternal life is living for others you've got to come to that place I don't feel like doing it do it anyhow I don't want to do it do it anyhow why because the Bible said do unto others as you would have them do unto you you do not know the needs of other people but if God has placed you in a position to help and satisfy their needs that's what you're supposed to do whether you like it or not how many y'all know Jesus as a friend you may have heard me say that I said many people know him as Lord a lot of him know him as a Savior but only a few people have come to know that he's a friend and the Bible said friends I sticks closer than a brother that's what we all need hallelujah in this day and time we know your master Savior we know him as our Lord but we need him as a friend you know what a friend will do listen to all your problems and keep it a friend would be able to tell you and advise you in a healthy way is that right a friend would cop with you even when they know you're wrong one time my friend down in South Carolina we've been friends ever since third grade and he said just something to me on the phone and offended me and I said man you offended me he said I can't offend you I couldn't help but laugh because I was really trying to pretend that I was upset because I knew I would have offended me but because he's a friend right he could not oh Lord mercy I had a laugh about that he did too God is good to us and that's the kind of God we serve with the conch God we're serving a lord who didn't decide to love us when we were born but loved us before we were even on the earth God amen loved her so much he put our names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God even when we were sinners about said in that Bob we're here same as he died for us so you gotta understand he claimed us right and he saw us and knew us and protected us even when we didn't even know him that was his will now if God protected us why we were sinners what is he going to do while we're Saints y'all hear me God but you gotta understand that things that we do go through it is the will of God he said I can't believe it if you know well you know I a friend of mine who lost his spouse I said brother God would put you to the test you say I love God then you must come to say I also love his will whatever he decides whatever his decisions are for me they're correct they're right y'all understand me when I came to the Lord when I came to the Lord my whole family for sickening people who I loved my friends first took me people who I love but God chose that for that to be hmm and you said what what don't get married with God cuz he's now saving you because you said you wanted to be saved he is his job to serve as a son to separate the light from the darkness and you said what brother was what he said let me tell you something you said well God I want to be just like you well when you say that you giving your life to God to mold and make you in there and every way he can to be just like him hello he's the Potter and you weren't the clay you know you'll never see that you know the thing is when you see that clay getting kind of stiff and hard what does he do he add more water to it and what pressure so when you reject God's will and you began to get hard on him I said I just remember what you told me you said you want to be like me and I'm molding you I'm in control here we don't like it when we're not in control it hurts when we're not in control come on somebody I know this is elementary but I want you to understand there's a revelation behind what I'm trying to get over it is your will your will that's hindering you you hinder you it ain't God that hinders you you hinder you and when fail to follow through with the will of God you're looking for trouble if not death you sure Oh what about a prophet you don't look like the Prophet had perfect lives no they didn't Nathan said under David Nathan said all David do what's in your heart a prophet could never be wrong but out of his mouth said David go do whatever in your heart and God called Nathan on the side says no David is not going to build this temple now I want you to go back and tell David what it had to be humiliating it was a humbling experience for Nathan he had to go back said David I was wrong the Lord corrected me you're not going to build a house but Solomon's gonna build it you say ain't nothing to that let me tell you something when pride pride sometimes you don't even know you got it and you may not have it but there are times pride will anoint you to keep you from doing the will of God because it's gonna humiliate you you don't want people to see that you have a need and you don't want people to know that you having me that's nonsense one of my sons are going through something right now I said what you need to do is ask God to help you kill and destroy that pride that you got once you destroy that god I lift you up hello look at it when God told John John you go tell Herod that woman you God is not yours world but God he might kill me ain't that what I think what is it that God told ah no I forgot what the name of the servant is Ida told you go tell her that hey Bob I'm gonna meet him in a certain place he said don't you know you know if you don't show up he gonna kill me you understand me it's fighting with that will we are fight but we must need to say Lord kill it kill it that's why Paul said I die daily I'm not going out the door to God has destroyed my will that my wheel today is his will ooh am I wrong the Bible said Wells you say well how do you get in trouble because we get in trouble by not obeying God's will the Bible said acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path when you knowledge God I do it every day every morning I acknowledge the Lord I acknowledge his word and I says lord help me you know who I am you know what I am you know my weakness is and everything else and I know I'm not you're not through with me yet personally I need perfection I want perfection and whatever is gonna take you to get me there do it I don't care about the pain right now folks and I've gone through a lot of pain I wonder I wonder sometime hi I'm stealing my right mind but I am only because of the grace of God some things I can look back and laugh at but while I was going through it was not funny Jana Stephanie hey Jeremiah I want you to preach to these people they so hard and hard Jeremiah and I want you to know not one I'll go repent being a preacher like Jeremiah Amen preaching every day and everybody's just giving him the eye and you must be crazy attitude but he had to preach it's hard on the preacher when you can't get a Amen it's a struggle brother brown said if you don't say Amen I feel funny right remember the man said what they be saying evening and doing all that screaming brother and said if they wouldn't you sure what do you mean Oh real birth and this is what God has shown me this is what I love about this thing about this message I could have been deceived oh when I was in the Apostolic Church I seen God create things in the Apostolic Church I saw God and I knew nothing about this message I had a need and he supplied it that's all I knew it wasn't I commanded the thing I just said lord I need this and God produced it I had a witness the witness she's going on now but she's standing right there when that thing all of a sudden appeared you don't have to believe it I'm just telling you I've seen the pillar of fire the pillar of cloud I've seen all kinds of things people Eurasian no pillar of fire I've seen the purified and people try to tell you didn't see it but because I saw the pillar fire doesn't save me millions of people saw the pillar fire look at all the people that follow brilliant Brandon who saw the field of fire where are they today it's the word birth the birth that makes you love this that's what makes you different brother ever said it like this amen and conferences he said birth is a mess it'll make you do things you didn't think you'll do but out of that death and corruption comes forth life no she can bring forth its life until it's dead and right and out of that rotten mess when there's nothing else left to rot it it's only the life that lives when the Sun comes to God he is given tests Oh Lord you should what do you mean I came home one day speaking in tongues and the people got scared and laughed at me when I was telling cost to you no that was that was the thing then but I want to tell you something I didn't have the word but if one thing for certain got an or thing kept me now I don't know what people you didn't get the Holy Ghost till you came to this message I beg your pardon and that means brother Branham didn't get the only goes until the message came he was in a Baptist Church among the Pentecostal people y'all hear no same the fullness of the world reveal more to me but my breath didn't come by way of a church or building my birth came by Christ into a well-bred brother boys you don't know how can you prove that Scripture the Bible says and even brother man said Philip was translated into the wilderness into the desert that that you not wasn't part of the group you ever thought about where that little that water came from they were in the desert all of a sudden all of a sudden they come up on their asses it's the same it came from the same place - Ram came from hallelujah of Abraham where did it come from it wasn't even the habitation of a ram to be in the top of a mountain hallelujah come on somebody you saw what do you mean what I'm trying to say and I don't mean to be so long I'm almost done when we trusted the Lord with all our hearts it will stop the murmuring and complaining why should you learn and complain if you trust God you say I love him but I tell you what this was going when I'm going through I don't know why I'm going through this and you know what I feel like this and all of us deserve hell we ought to be grateful that God has chosen us amen in him come home how many listen if we were under the law all of us would be dead long time ago but God rich and mercy and all God is asking for this little bride to do is line herself up in his will that's it do you deny yourself is that what Jesus said you must deny yourself to follow me mm-hmm God itself is that right I'm almost done died of self because remember Amen you think about a more by touch talking about Ruth now Ruth was a more - the law was against her her people was against her Israel was against her everybody was against Ruth right and here was Ruth caught a revelation that the god of Naomi was God she denied herself whatever her occupation was if she was a priestess if she was whatever she wasn't near Moab she denied it she did not her loved ones she didn't hide her origin when she said your God will be my god and your people be my God my people she denied her origin she denied everything about herself and she said wherever you live Ruth or Naomi when you die will die wherever you lie on the line you understand me your God will be my god and she that's what God requires from us and I find out that people you know they get to the place they honor their natural families more so than their spiritual and I don't think that's right it's not right is that right because when you're born into gods family there's a Lord Jesus your mother your mama they're waiting on you like she's gonna get some special privilege garden given those special privilege say who is my mother and my father my brother my sister who is but them that follow the father's will those who do my father's will right it's doing his will dying to yoga though I wish I can show you the way God has shown me a minute opened up something I can't even explain it all I know is that God from that point on has been giving me grace to check every motive that right in the message of unveiling God brother brother BAM said your people is my people working with Ruth your God is my God where you die I die where you buried I'll be buried I won't die to self so greatly until I am a new person in Christ Jesus see what he said I want to die to self and that's what Ruth did she died to self when she left everything behind she died to self and was willing to take the persecution from those she knew would person cuz the Jews hated Moabites right and there was a law don't have nothing to do with them oh come on somebody you know that's how it is oh you don't became one of them brother Mike you don't became one of them folks don't have men to do with those folks oh I can go you could go to any Church but you don't go to that kind oh I can't help myself hallelujah that's the thing that's called me hallelujah I am Who I am hallelujah oh my the first thing I want to say is Jesus never live for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proves it when I come in the Lamb of God he lived in and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no law you live for others mmm someone said how can you stand let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten forgotten that they were sons your son you're taking Christ place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for us well brother branham I can live for this brother but because he sure was a nice man he said that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you that's in your bosom your face facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the Sheep gives up his wool you look on to our Calvary I hope this helped you to get in the place that's what the Taverner see that's what the people has got to do is find out where what you are and what's your purpose church is it isn't going to church to just play music sing song Church it's a place where correction judgment begins at the house of God we must recognize ourself dead and alive to Christ when then he may may the way that would come could sacrifice ourselves to his service to follow him if we follow him we lead the life that he lived hallelujah huh that's wonderful Jesus said and spoken let me just give you a few quotations on it listen close don't miss it Jesus said at that day he would separate the people like the sheep and the goats and he would say to the ghost stand on the left side and to the Sheep stand on the right side and he said to the ghost depart from me because I was hungry and you didn't feed me I was in prison and you did not visit me I was naked and you clothed me not I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was sick and you don't and you didn't visit me so depart from me and on the sheet on the ship he said I was hungry and you fed me I was naked and you give me clothes I was sick and you ministered to me and notice don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever I was unconstant Lee it was unconsciously done in other words they weren't doing it for reward they were doing it for recognition it was unconsciously done the people done don't do it for line-of-duty a man that gives you something another because he ought to do it a man that feeds you because he ought to do it he's got a selfish idea it should be your very life your very action hallelujah he said well I know the people are not there yet they're not because when you call for prayer nobody ever comes they selfish you might not need something but there's somebody in this church that needs prayer mmm and when we don't show up for prayer it's because we're selfish we got everything everything is okay with us we got what we need what about your brothers and sisters in the church what about those who need deliverance and you ought to be down on your knees praying for them see that's what I'm talking about people you got to become self less it was so surprising to these sheep that they said Lord when were you hungry and when would we feed you when were you hungry and we fed you when were you naked and we give you clothes when were your thirst and we give you drink when were you sick and we minister to you it was so Adam Attica Lee out of love just your life lived in them God let the people say that Carrie did it for us so automatically woo he didn't even have to think about it when were you Lord when we never knew that look at what Jesus Turner said in so much as you have done it unto these you did it unto me unselfish life not the second thought not to think about it but you are so dead to the things of this world and so alive in Christ and so walking on the the highway that these things are just as automatic things you just do it not saying well now the Lord would Lord won't mean to do that it's not that you're just part of him his Spirit is in you and you act the way he acted ah he said do you get it that's where we're supposed to be that's where he'll be a bring us to that is that okay lord help me Jesus I'm gonna stop I've got other things here but you know we look at this thing and we must understand that at the end of the day with free women we're free church we're not buying woman we're not a bondsman we're free and the Bible said he whom the Sun is set free is free indeed when you find yourself Amen thinking about oh well I should I do this or shall I do that we need to repent says Lord help me he it shouldn't even be a second thought when there's opportunity to do good we must do it right you know it's not all you know honey can you uh get me and you sit nice honey can you get me a piece of cake off she said well you know you sitting there you're not doing anything why can't you get your own cake y'all know we guilty or no hallelujah and we fail to see we being tested do unto others as you would have right cuz we have no idea why the person is sitting there asking that question maybe they feel tired or something that's going on there you know and maybe they just won't see you share a little bit of love there can you get me a glass of water y'all understand me just simple things that pass us by and we need the jump and I you know what really caught my attention went with these things no hope she wouldn't mind it but my wife was inside and the mailman had come and my daughter was coming to the house and she called my daughter says why are you coming to the house could you check the mailbox before coming into the house all of a sudden there was a silence and she had to think about it she eventually did it but I can almost hear her say like what she did say oh why can't you get it you closer to the house than I am right now but it was cold outside yeah I understand but regardless at what point do we become a sacrifice you do it not because you're not gonna always want to do right right you know me wanna do because of your flesh y'all heard what I said your will will always get in the way thank you jesus said you know I'm tired and I've been preaching three and a half years and these disciples have not been such a good you know I had to go take breaks at times didn't he he got away from us they stay here till I get back y'all understand that human part of us I need a break and he did and the thing about it is but it never stopped him from moving forward when he saw his own wheel getting in the way he prayed not my will but thine be done and when we see our own wheel getting in the way that's what we should pray Father let your will be done and we can overcome I'm telling you will come to perfection quicker that way then being stubborn with our own will right you say stubbornness it's not it is not obvious stubbornness as witchcraft remember when Saul was supposed to do the will of God and he changed it just a little bit and he was so deceiving said but I've done it Sammy I did what God said do know God said kill everything kill the king kill everything if he's got a dog kill it Sammy says no kept the best thing I mean song-song said we've kept the best things Sammy said bring me that key where's that a gag and did what he did he cut see you got to understand that King is that that will I'm gonna kill it right now and Samuel I saw you're gonna die too because you disobeyed God and it was so made plain to you and you said right there and you let the people persuade you to do something different than what God say do that woman one time the Prophet said there's a prophet who was a prophet who said to the other prophet come on and go to my house it's gonna be okay God said and maybe God told him to say that I don't know all I know is this that prophet was eaten killed rather what was in the lion are there lion killed by a lion because he disobeyed because his will he let the devil persuade him I know I gave you a lot to think about and I trusted what I bought this morning was a blessing to you because it it helps me now every when you do the will of God like I say it won't bring bring pleasure to the flesh all the time sometimes it will you know when God told him and go over there and get them grapes I'm sure they enjoyed those grapes hallelujah but it was the will of man that came back and said we can't take it don't ever say if God said I'm gonna make you perfect and you can do all things through Christ Jesus don't ever let your will tell you something different let's Stan that's there I trust you were blessed Lord let thy will be done that's that's my desire I trust is your desire for God's perfect will to be done in your life that's what the bride is about the bride that's what brothers say the bride is about every word of God he broke one word but she will not and the only way that you could ever not break the word is to receive the Holy Ghost in you because that's perfection you become perfection because he's perfection you become accepted because he accepted he's accepted you are and I are accepted in the beloved he became our sin that we might become his righteousness and that's why the devil downplays the Holy Ghost he let the Holy Ghost be anything anything and you know what the Holy Ghost is life that's the only life it's the Holy life of God and I don't care what kind of emotional experiences you have don't settle down until you see the life of Christ on display in your life let's pray father we come before your Lord humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness and your grace God you've been so good to us we thank you father for just allowing us to see in your word where it all started the will of Lucifer destroyed the unity of the brother and will or Lucifer brought death the will of Lucifer brought judgment we find out that every time we are influenced by the will of Lucifer we get the same response we know that you said in your word that we love you will keep your commandment help us dear Jesus died and right to our will that your will may be done truly there's a lot of things that could be said and but I trust that whatever I left out Holy Spirit that you
