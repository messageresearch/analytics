is the day that the lord and i will i will be back yes sir I would like to read that some portion of scripture here like this probably part 1 on the Millennium I might have maybe two or three parts lord willing we'll see how it goes I now to get the my bottom of the name so I'll just use this one sorry buddy I've got to put that my partner Python forgot let's open up to revelation 20 verse 1 and I do have some quotes and scriptures and so forth to show later by the bang out to be read the text for tonight how do you feel they're about ready for a millennium and in glory yes there yes a man we're sorting ready for that I believe in him Satan Z to these 35 years i'm ready for a booking I don't know how long we'll be a hero by I'm ready for rest amen no temptation no teary Mentos in I know death those sickness ready for that on God's time even every sane one down to the grave looking for that right meaning for the high that day of sweep around the Bible called yeah so revelation 20 by God's grace we read verses 1 through 6 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand America that's a chain of circumstance and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nation's No More to the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loose for a little season for God and may God right that's later in the book there sorry previously in the book of Revelation first for here's where we get to the money and I saw Thrones and they SAT upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshipped the Beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they live and reign with Christ a thousand years but the rest of the Dead this is such an important Scripture the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection glory that beautiful shows that not everybody will live during the thousand years was a pathology of the the dead live because they come to the white throne judgment verse 6 well acid in holy is he that part in the first resurrection on such the second death has no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years let's turn to Isaiah 65 Isaiah 65 verse 19 very thankful for the word of God amen person maybe penny her brother Ram reads his texts in the future home 1964 to teach all the Millennium because he shows the difference between the future home and the new heavens of new herbs so he reads the scripture right here which worried tonight verse 19 and I'll rejoice in Jerusalem and joy my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more hurting her wow there's going to come a time when there's no more weeping in Jerusalem nor the voice of crying no more cry nutrislim there should be no more than sin infant of days nor an old man that have not filled his days for the child shall die a hundred years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed that's the scripture by the Venice that he can't explain that one verse 21 and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit okay they shall not be able and another and have it they should not plan another eat for as the days of a tree of the days of my people and my lecture long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain or bring forth for trouble but they are seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them I like this and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer they talk about a communion with god before you even asked Lord could be the answer is already they need oh that's a real convenient that's a glorified body yeah that's a brand-new poor buddy buddy yes and while there yes speaking I will hear a as have a little more prayer to having it on your heart just picking on it to God tonight Heavenly Father we love you or these things our beautiful future flings Lord we're looking forward to every say as we said died looking for this time when Christ would rule himself physically on the earth the Jews were so confused they thought this time would be right after his coming his first coming where he would rule with a rod of a hybrid but Lord it was to be a longer time away and you kept that from them Lord for a purpose so they would stay on the fire lines they would keep serving you but Lord nine we see where at the end give us grace to keep on the fire lines to keep serving your Lord if we're looking for this brand new day your promise said it's the seventh day to your God and Lord made a break for suit and prepares for that wonderful day we ask tonight in Jesus Christ thing and everybody said hey my god bless you didn't see there so then you can turn over to hdmi to sir thank you boo boo the man just got back traveling from the wedding yesterday right by the been the reason I asked if you meant was because Amen told me he could go see had to work so I'm sorry it might have been a silly question to you his brother younger younger brother qu got married yesterday so okay so i look at the millennium Bible said the line which would lie down with the lamb yeah okay Banshee to read that is actually verse 25 but let's read that now verse 20 but the wolf and the lamb shall be together in the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and thou should be the Serpent's meat they should not hurt nor destroyed all my holy mountain say at the door hmm so let's look good look at the Millennium I actually never preach on the Millennium like a whole sermons this is new to me okay now watching the clock let me start my watch here so I don't go over too much like I said I mainly do that for my physical health so I don't hurt my own body I'm just have a tendency to wear myself out so that's okay we'll try to go 45 minutes here or less maybe by God's grace okay so we read our text here tonight those are our text that we read revelation 20 and Isaiah 65 so if anyone ever asked where do you find the text of the millennium that's a good place to start right there buzz Randy's both of those and we know what set a thousand years in Revelation 20 um for mostly that in familiar with brother branham's quotes he said Jesus comes in three Cummings the first is to redeem his bride and then raptures bride and the rule with her in the millennium so kind like three hours okay it's kinda like the same three hours as this message of the hour he comes to restore the hearts comes to reveal or finish the mysteries then he comes the rapture the bride so this this enzyme message kind of has three hours to I thought was interesting how Christ coming has three hours to redeem rapture rule with the bride brother BAM sells this and blast eNOS names in 1962 God makes himself perfect in 3 i'm skipping down to the blue now he he makes himself perfect in three cummings the first to redeem is bride second time to receive his bride third time in the linen with his bride and everything is perfected threes so there's three comings of Christ right redeemed up and then receive a rapture and then rain with her in the Millennium does the Bible say will be kings and priests in the Millennium okay now here's what modem teaches on a millennium and he teaches out of the future home and out of Isaiah 65 now for those either remember this brother Han teaches this and then a few months later in questions and answers in 64 they asked him about some of these scriptures do they pertain to the future home or not or do they pertain to the millennium and some fun brother Ramesses I don't know so I want you to look at the text for the Rams using now to me this isn't a big deal like someone might say oh I thought he was a prophet how come he can't plainly stay either one well to me uh to me it's because this deals with future things brother Brandon was to restore right yeah peace restore all the loose ends that remove stuff right and he did that he restored the mystery right reveal the mysteries restored the the lost truth so to me it's not really like a big deal but let's just look at what he said so let's get right to it it's in the paragraph 60 he said now the Book of Isaiah you want to put the scripture down his age 65 17 so we started a night team vomit turn back I didn't read 17 and 18 because I didn't want to cause any confusion I wanted to explain that for brother man couldn't exactly say on some of these scriptures which pertains you didn't pertain to the millennium or to pertain to the future home so that's why I started there at verse 19 okay now he says Isaiah speaking of the Millennium that thousands years of rest for the people of God Isaiah spoke of it he said there was all the former things have passed away they'll build houses and have it them if we had time maybe just take time and read this just a minute Isaiah 65 now we begin the verse 17 now I put all of the scriptures in italicized spot okay so this is all scripture that brother random reads during the service in 64 so we'll read that by God's grace he starts in verse 17 and behold I create new heavens and a new earth now that sounds like the new heaven to the new wrestle like the future hope but this is his text for the Millennium right he just said this is a text for Lillian Isaiah the prophet was one of the prophets that wrote exactly the entire Bible his prophecy he starts out in the creation in the middle of the book about the 40 chapter comes around John the Baptist the New Testament winds up here in this book and the revelations in the Lydia there is 66 books in the Bible there are 66 chapters in Isaiah he wrote a complete commentary and now we find out here now he's getting the 60 min chapter one more chapter he speaks to the Lydian a notice how beautiful you hold on create new heavens and new earth and the former things should not be remembered nor coming tonight it's the pass away but be glad and rejoice even that which I've created for behold I Craig Jerusalem or rejoice and her people enjoy apartment so he just read verses 17 and 18 now you reads verse 19 I'll rejoice in Jerusalem and enjoy my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more hurting her for nor the voice of crime there should be no more that in for the day's an old man that is not those days for a child to die 100 years old and ascender being a hundreds old shall be accursed then shall and they shall build houses and you have it then and then shall plant vineyards and shall either / that now he's at verse 22 in Isaiah 65 now and they shall not build at another inhabit that is your farm your son fall heir to it nor some of your heirs they should not plan another eat there they do their own planting and remain there they got life eternal oh yeah for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my lung might elect shallow and enjoy the works of their hands they should not labor menor bring forth for trouble they or they are the seat of the blessed the Lord and their offsprings with them but when it says now notice here is where I'm going to get it after a while he's at verse 24 now and it should come to pass that before they call i will answer law they're speaking out here and a wolf and the lamb shall feed together in the lion shall eat straw like a bullock does should be the Serpent's me and they shall not hurt nor destroy and all my holy mountain saith the Lord so he reads basically from 17 to 25 years of the chapter calls at the Millennium what a promise of these prophets and great sages teachers of the Bible way back in ancient a seeing this glorious day cup now I'm going to read some more quotes but these are on a black screen so it's going to flip your eyes are a little bit might affect your eyes hope it don't hurt rise hey i'm going to read more of these quotes so about three hours later the sermon brother brahim says the new earth is not the Millennium here's some quotes just as God grid the earth in six days made the earth in six days or six thousand years be how ignorant we read the scripture 1000 years was one day here's the scripture second Peter 381 days with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years was born day now he reads these scriptures to that we are already read be read these already they live and reign with Christ a thousand years in Revelation 20 for a revelation twenty five and six ready read these I'm gonna go right to the quote but millennial reign the thousand years is not the new earth see the lineal rain is a different rain that's what we got into the modem but that isn't the new earth and new heaven no no there's just a rest plate that's just the rest place you see a rest period not at all the new heavens and new earth or you see in the blood and we have things that would not go into that it's a type of the old seventh day out at Eden the seven day after he made the world the seventh day he rested Eden and the millennium so the seventh day when he rested in the book of Genesis was a type of the millennium he would rest the millennium is not the end of it there will still be tied after the Millennium the Millennium is a space of time but not the newer knowing do you notice and that will go into it after bit here's the here's the visual I gave you when I preach on the future hope remember that I think it was the first sermons of the new year I think the first weekend in january i want to go over it again a little bit here okay so day one so this is a thousand years since creation we believe there's been about 6,000 years since the since Adam he but been on the earth now there might have been mins of news of yours mother have sycamore that as far as human a human existence upon the earth about 6,000 years because brother Graham said every 2,000 years God destroys the earth or does something major the first two thousand was Noah's Flood second two thousand with Jesus blood and now the third two thousand is then millennium a new heavens and new earth and or I say millennium ok now I'm day to you have the flood nose blood ok day three day four I have the Calvary the blood of Christ hey day 5 a-6 is the seven churches so we're kind of at the end of the sixth day right now program says okay fires going to come next because we walked we must walk out on the ashes of the wicked right so fire has to come in for a lock on ashes of the wicked there must be some type of atomic fire brother BAM says there's some fire you know burning up around the earth and then day seven brother Graham said is the Millennium so a little word dare millennium that's the seven day okay so God created the earthen since seven and seven days was saying interrupted the seventh day he never got a seven day okay so since then since Adam now we've had six thousand more years that's the way I understand brother random teaching if I'm wrong that pardon me I thought that's how he taught it the Millennium it that is the seventh day is the seventh a group of a thousand year period right so the eighth day brother branham set is like going back to the first day just like a Sunday right you start the week all over again okay which represents eternity and program so that represents the new heavens and the new earth okay so seven days William eight days like the first day i guess like you've entered into the the circle of eternity okay now in eternity well on the new heavens and new earth oh that's the eighth day so that's when the earth a heaven comes down to earth right that's the future home coming down dwell on the earth that's what's going to happen i don't think it's that's not drawn to scale out of its that big compared to the earth or not but it is large the new heavens and the new earth rather what to do have it on top here mr. program says see the world has now almost 6,000 years old every 2,000 years had a destruction okay so he talks about this i'm just going to skip ahead to this this is what brother Ram talk every 2,000 years God does something major Noah Messiah and now Son of Man ministry you know son of man ministry or we could say breaking forth in the millennium and so forth I'm going to say it's all major things these are all major things and so that's the seventh like i said here's the seven church ages now that's what he taught the future home okay that's we taught the future hope you'll get that on the future home now he keeps going in burton paragraph two or three and then birds are off and claims at furrs own puts his own back on it and notice not the perfect world disability and it's a type of the seven day so just show you that in the muddiness type of the seventh day or the 7,000 years since a sin then comes the white throne judgment seat we saw a judgment we're still in time in the lid IAM it's a day 1,000 years it's a time element I'll get that mixed up with the new earth that cuz it's not all right is that helpful to see that my god is gracious that helpful okay I thought it might be okay to show that again by the great store I love other brands teaching there that's wonderful we've been blessed to receive a prophetess our a tent I wanted over this down there must be a cleansing before the Millennium brother branham said it's the our valve Armageddon so we'll take this in the scripture you have to turn there because I have the Scriptures up here for you the Battle of Armageddon brings in the cleansing for the Millennium orange oh these scriptures and quote safe now our first text revelation 6 is under the sixth seal if you remember that and brother has that's called the tribulation sea or the sixth seal when the two prophets bring down the judgment seal upon the earth that's part of the purging in the cleansing he actually called it the purging seal the pershing time in the sixth seal ecarter now revelation 19 is when we get the picture of Armageddon when Jesus comes back on a white horse that's Armageddon okay he's guy is guys armies on white horses who's that that's you and I were Saints where the armies following Christ amen and then destruction comes when the sword comes out of his mouth destroys the night on the earth and files come and heat up their bodies and shortly after that there must have come fire out of heaven to purge the earth okay so here's the scripture now that's really small I'm sorry about that but this is the this is the the judgment scroll I'm sorry the judgment seal rather under the sixth seal so I'm not going to read all that but you're familiar with that property that's called the great day this wrath I'm sorry I'm so smart I made this a long time ago when I tried to make them bigger fun we will read this one okay revelation 19 19 now this is after Jesus already come back on white horses ok this is the last few scriptures on this and I saw the Beast of the kings of the earth and the armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse it against his army and the Beast was taken with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before so see the Pope's killer numerical shirts prepare yourself now we might not see it that's pretty hope and pray we don't but if we do that's what's going to happen but notice the Pope the false prophet does miracles the Bible says they're lying wonders and miracles right if you read revelation 13 lying wonders and miracles yeah all right verse 20 it's finished that with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and then that worshipped His image these both were cast alive in the lake of fire burning with brimstone and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that SAT upon the horse which sword proceed out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled flesh that's the end that's the Battle of Armageddon okay Jesus takes the beast and the false prophet and throws him into lake of fire burning with brimstone okay remember what is the Beast the Beast is out sphere of Rome it's the unclean Antichrist fear who's the boss prophet as the Pope that's anointed with that spirit they're both cast a line and the laker were burned with fire brimstone here's where he says in victory day 63 it'll finally wind up in the great battle of Armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to that alarm again and that'll settle the whole thing just before the great millennium Armageddon is to clean off the earth and she's getting clean out the earth she repute eyes herself with his atomic blowing and the volcanic ash and they sink this soaked blood of men upon the earth and Sid and crime she sinks beneath the earth the volcanic breaks out again and renews and cleanse the earth for the great millenniums phone app says atomic and then he says about cannock cleaning yeah so about halos bursting forth and all those earthquakes that are going to come forth the revelation i think there's three major earthquakes or two in revelation well as having to the earthquakes right there spreads apart sometimes or come together in this case it was friends apart volcano is going to come up right on the mag mode everything live on everything going to come up he cleanses church during that time for people to live there amen I say I like that all right this is one the seventh seal but millenniums coming up and see everything that's got any built-in it is to be purged during the sixth seal that's God's purging time lot of these plagues as buyers and it's going to come to the place and the vials and everything is to purge the earth now do you notice opening to the Seventh Seal it's also three-fold mystery okay and he kind of goes into that he talks about the revelation will be right at the coming of Christ because Christ said so known we return when he comes so that's why I teach that the Seventh Seal the literal opening of it is a day and hour of christ's coming the rapture that's why I teach it like that there's numerous quotes like that that's kind of a whole different topic okay so can everybody see that the millennium before the Millennium happens can nobody see the earth has to be cleaned out and hurt ever see that it has to now let's look at the scripture here if you got your Bibles in revelation 3 i don't think i have this one here but i don't have another slide show out of a revelation 3 okay yeah cuz I didn't put the scripture down to brother branham mentions this Jesus sit on the throne of David in the Millennium now how many know that how many know right now Jesus on whose throne he's on the father's throat right now right because that's the throne in heaven but when Jesus comes down to earth he said this is not the Father's throne he said this is my throne which is the throat of the son of David he's got so in heaven is the Father's throne earth is the throne of the son of david all right so here's we're in the key of David was David was not David the king of Israel all is real and has got Jesus the Son of David according to the fact that he will sit on the throne of David the millennium and rain to rule over his heritage surely so the key of David signifies it as Jesus will bring in the Millennial age Laurie here's where you go to the scripture doubt i'm gonna skip ahead to the blue this is a mighty God available for us 1964 now the scripture is revelation 321 I think it's italicized program etat I'm sorry it's italicized there because he quotes in the sermon I'm going to read to him that overcometh will I grit and sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his fro so nobody know that there's two thrones right there's the Father's throne and then there's the sudden throat the father says in heaven the sun's is on the earth amen let's read the blue there when the Millennium he comes the son of David is set up a throne of David King he was to take the throne of David he saw the Father's throne now and then he said he's over covers herself with me and my throne as I've overcome in South my father's home so see so he in the ville idiom he'll be the son of David what is it the same God all the time just changing his bass I love this I like this hopefully this will make sense this is the best picture I can find them how Jesus might look right now interceding for its ok i know it might not be the best picture that's the best i could find are we going on google images so right now right now Jesus is in the office of the Son of God because he's on the father's from right the limbs and Son of Man some of God so David Wright in the Millennium though he'll be on the son of David thrown on the earth and he will be the son of David yes praise God all right there was that siren isha woman said someday would have mercy on me and you won't even look at her and he said he talked about how she's a doll remember that but then she said Lord even the children get the crumbs of the dogs get the crumbs that fall from the Masters taken ass and once she called it Lord then she can minister to him to her right that's right because she kept calling son of David that wasn't that's not how he knew her because he's not son of David he's not and he wants his son of David to the Gentile bedtime right this is a Jewish position right but he grabs the Gentiles into it so he could administered her son of David but when she called lord ruler he's the Lord Jesus Christ right the Lord to the Gentiles then he can minister to her alright so here's the three sons if you need a picture that in your mind I love that Hoffman's headband what a wonderful that's his earthly ministry he was son of man on the earth now he's on the Father's throne as son of God right if the Millennium he'll be set up David and beyond the son of David strongly on the throne on the earth ruling over his real right and of course the bride and everything like that okay does that help by God's grace he comes his three sons okay so the man son of God son of David praise the Lord I love things like this I'd love to see it and I'd like to see the picture of it you know I like that um okay now i think i forgot to take out i want to save this quote to the end some of the closeout it's just a moment I thought I got that out of there ok I'm going to skip that quote I'm gonna say that for the ND i remember slide 34 i'm sorry i missed about 24 minutes left okay spare with me I want to try to keep it shorter so now we kind of went over this the Millennium is the day of the Lord or the thousand years with the Lord and this is his Eden the millennium has got Jesus's Eden right God's eden never got to have because the serpent should use e they call them all manner of evil knaves making fun of it but there's coming a great a notable day when they will wail ohio for the lamb it's coming in Wrath to judge the world that is when the righteous will have their day with the lord for the wicked shall burn and the righteous walk over the ashes into the millennium so once once the millennium scripture Malachi 4 3 and he should run down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet and the day that I subdue them safe the lower I that's what happens before the Millennium Falcon it comes up and burns all the sinners of a medicine maybe atomic fire will burn maybe somehow but all the sinners will be turned to ashes and then the righteous flock of pop walk on in the linen on the ashes the wicked by taking team you said this do you know that you believe him are you sick and tired of Satan's Kingdom are you sick and tired of it yeah do you believe it's coming to the lib unto his full of his to his eating right is a minute so the bloody will be our heated praise God another you oh my beautiful let's go through some Bible teaching and programs quotes on the Millennium now here the righteous literally literally walk into the millennium upon the ashes of the wicked we're literally going to do it the Bible said the day cometh that shall burn us up all the proud here that do wickedly shall be stubble so god help us out to be dry frightful right almost be humble alright and that day that cover shall birth of upset the Lord host but that it shall leave them either rootin or branch well do you that fear my name shall the son of righteous arrives of healing in his being and you should go for the Grove as calves of the skull to imagine the healing we're going to see we're to be walking on ashes never see jesus healed the earth oh nice landscaping he's going to do coming soompi landscapers out to him they do a good job that's nothing like Jesus going to do right I vaginally the original size of all the fruits member how they were packing those fruits into the holy land of the spies back those breaks that were big poor men had to carry him ever more by he's going to bring healing to this world alright man the Sun shall rise with healing in his wings all right and he should read out of the wicked sea for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet and the day that I shall do as saith the Lord of hosts now this is Christ mystery God revealed now that's about guy not three not four because now a lot that I'm sorry cuz Elijah that was to come to alki for the earth was to be burnt with a bourbon heat and the righteous was to walk out in the Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked see so it's not that one see she's shown the difference between the different Elijah's right because John the Baptist was in Malachi 3 in Malachi 4 but he showed the difference between their ministries that's true that's the next video I'm maybe just so you know this week I'm working on the william branham videos last thing i got up the obama or homosexual is abomination i got those two videos last week on this week i right yesterday i recorded about 45 minutes of video on brother branham as the messenger the hour we working on that this week i hope to get that up for you soup by God's grace amen okay church age book chapter 2 now let's get that girl Scripture now we know that the Lord's date I'm sorry now we know what the Lord's Day is not if it is not saturday or sunday what is it well let's put it this way today is certainly not the Lord's Day this is man's name see that today's man's name it is man's work man's doing man church man's idea worship and everything for this man's world or cosmos but the day of the Lord is coming yes it is just at this time of the revelation of Jesus Christ John was taken up by the sphere and transported by the spirit to that great day that is coming the Lord's Day is when the days of man are over the kingdoms of this world will then become the kingdoms of our God amen and keeps going the day of the Lord is when the judgments fall and after that comes the what millennium so the day of the Lord is when he finally deals and judges all this sin upon this earth that's the day of the Lord then comes the millennium right now the world does what it was with the Christian is that right they call the Christian all manner of evil names making fun of it but there's coming that great notable day when they will weigh on how for the lamb is coming in Wrath to judge the world hmm and then he quotes the scripture up walking upon the ash of the wicked right okay so now I know the day of the Lord is the day of the Lord is Armageddon basically you might even with the tribulation there it's when he deals with sin and judges sin and then we walk out into the money now let's get the next one here because I just had my own thoughts that I always tense with my thoughts oh there when I go back and study I want you to give my thoughts and I'm just trying to you know place things together right now say this bow during the Millennium and he's not literally on the earth okay st. this bounder the Loom he just residence earlier say in his literally cash into the bottomless pit and he shut up and there's a seal upon he's literally shut up in there and to change of circumstance because my circumstance is that literal chains keeping him under it's the seal of God keeping him under there praise God was stealing the CEO of the seals place upon him he shut up at the bob was fit and he's kept there by a chain of circumstance in his circumstances he's under there he's not going to get out because God put a seal apart okay now here are some good questions and answers 1964 does the Millennium have to do with the 1000 years could it not be a generation know who says I believe it was on a generation a generation the Bible was 40 years ababa said and with Christ a thousand years he'll be 1,000 earth because 1,000 years upon the earth is only counted for a time for a parable like to God is one day 1,000 years upon the earth is only one day with God as God counting time probably understands that now so a day with God is a thousand years the man I love this is so awesome oh we're so blessed that a prophet now he keeps going so it's that Sabbath day when the church will know more labour against sin and Satan is bound for little season thousand years because the subjects is all in hell so all saying subjects aren't hell and his the church is on the earth is redeemed and write the presence of God so can you imagine that all of the demons right are kept in that prison house probably tormenting those that are being held for judgment is warily going to be where their souls going to be the whole time while the thousand years going on it must be a prison-house about so they preach the spirits that were in prison right right like my dad said you don't you don't send somebody to the courtroom boom you're you know judge somebody without sending to the court right all right and so the greatest court that we're going to have is the white throne judgment that's the course that's the course session where the books will be open and everybody read and the US those are giving eternal life on the right hand and goats on the left right so they're waiting in a prison until their court day they're waiting a thousand years in prison until the white throne judgment the court day but he said the church that's on earth is redeemed and write the brides of Christ my hands of thousand tears and the friends of Jesus Christ so he has nothing can work on so it's not a chain I said has a log chain it's a change circumstance he has nothing to do he's helpless and hopeless four thousand years that's a tuna he's not on the earth he could say under the well under the earth remember this bottomless pit is okay alright so the validity of is the seventh day as we already said and the linen is also the honeymoon for christ in his bride this in the future home this ability or a the style years is not the newer little rain is the different rain that's what we go into the Millennium that isn't a new earth the new heaven though just a rest place see a rest period not at all the new heaven to earth for you see in the Millennium we have things that we cannot go to that i think i read this or did not ok let's go to support of this and i notice not the perfect world this millennium it's a tie for the seventh day then comes a white throne judgment see we still have the judgment we're still tied of a man it's a day 1,000 years i think i read that one too ok so here's what I'm going to get to now bear with me on this one the Millennium is the seventh day ok now he says this my man says is not notice it was also called the eighth day last a feast of the tabernacle notice after that after the last feast day after the last Church a junker the last complete seven days upon the earth after looting that is holy convocation comes remember this is the Feast of Tabernacles Tabernacles we're gathering places amen we're in the velineon the Bible said they shall build houses they shall not inhabit okay so listen just let me try to just slowly explain this brother branham is looking at the seven feasts of Israel the seventh one is the Feast of Tabernacles okay the seventh day here was the millennium right at seven thousand years the Williams here's what I mean hope it's not confusing here's what's different i already showed you this here's what's different can ever see these down here the first day of personal years is a type of the Passover a second is the type of unleavened bread and third is type of first fruits those are the seven the seven feasts of Israel this is just a tight brother branham says so if you listen to that and hear him say oh the Millennium is a type of the Feast of Tabernacles it is because it's the seventh okay the Millennium we build houses right well the Feast of Tabernacles what they do what the Jews do they built booths right which is like building houses and they drove the boost to remember that when they're in Egypt they had to build houses themselves at bonita okay so i just want to show this to you so you don't get confused brother adam says the feast of tabernacles is like the millennium it's because they're both the Tabernacles the seventh feast of Israel and the linen is a seventh day or the seventh group of a thousand years okay that's just a tight I'm just showing it to you so you won't be confused hopefully by God's grace all right okay all right oh that's a blessing of I God's grace where's the work work working with numbers on that one okay I got 15 more minutes to bear with me here okay but in the newer he's already went prepared the place it's bill we have nothing to do with the building of it case of event says that's why the new earth and Lily were different than linen we build houses in the new earth the house of God comes down we got Jesus is the one built in that house praise god jesus jesus said I go to prepare a place for you and brother never said Jesus doing that right now somehow he's also building a future home the New Jerusalem right now Jesus fills that house in the future home he built that house but we build our own houses during the Millennium all right that's why I just want to say that by God's grace that's the difference between the millennia we built our own houses but the future hold Jesus is building that house right now a New Jerusalem all right now that's just yellow sorry about that that just shows me when I get a quick visual where I am on my notes okay here's some quotes only for mother bandits out of quotes I know how many scriptures and here's where we gather don't confuse okay where I'm sorry some people get confused I just want to bring this up so you can see it some people say we're in the bride age and we're no longer in Laodicea now I preach this before but just listen the bride age is just a baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have the bachelor all the ghosts you're living has a bride member on this earth and it's like you've entered into a new reality right it's like you've entered into a new age in the soul but church the latest in church age is still going on from the random says until the rapture two people say oh they have to see has over where the bride a 12 yeah to us to us we're not living according to the spirit of labor to see anymore but that church age is still going on and here's where he says that's for the grand point blade he said that the church age ed and this black doubt and the bride is called out and we've already entered in the Tribulation Period today that's what they're asking Emily the tribulations now and the church age is over but I said no no no oh you're I wish I could just have more time on that seat the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease okay so they say all work no longer let us see it well yeah spiritually but but legacy is still here turn out they're still here sometime people and they get quotes and they just go too far on it maybe they haven't read this yet yes look let us see the age is still going on and we're not living in coordinates purity more where the spiritual bride age we're living according to baptism of the Holy Ghost our lives okay so he plainly says it right there Leila see it does not end until the bride goes in the rapture all right then the church age sees okay now goes for the rest of these and last time events are not going to spend time on that here's the great question you had right then your mind when we read our texts and our children bar on the bloody or not by the ramekin the Bible talks about infants right and child with 900 years old well here's what he said romance and I don't know which owner be border the thousand-year maligno ray that's the question in my mind that I told you the other day I don't know it looks a whole lot like it could be it looks a whole lot like it couldn't be I'm going to be honest with you as I know how to be I don't know to this time if God ever reveals it I'll tell you but wait it has to come from God praise the Lord you're my children I wouldn't tell you I don't know whether there will be or whether there will not be I can't say that's our level brought brother Brandon yes he just being honest yeah but I'm gonna come down the water bath because if ur Godhead he said the say the Lord Trinitarians of the devil he says I'll say the Lord is only one batches the Lord Jesus Christ upstate the Lord right that says the Lord Rose will rule up the entire yeah God will destroy America thus saith the Lord you got I mean when he knew and profit when he said that's it the Lord he got it when he wasn't sure he said I don't know yeah I appreciate a man like that because he's humble he'll speaking of us he's got they'll say the lower can't say for sure I love that now but the Bible they asked him again this is in the same serious questions answers he says there be no sit on the earth or the blend the money and we do I like this will be in glorified bodies in the land that means we can eat and drink but we don't have to go to sleep you can touch each other hug one another right you got those robes on the righteous of the Saints were glorified bodies are in the linen all of it will there be sitting on the earth during that time no there will not be no sin on earth Satan's bouncy so he came to see people to sin and will there be people on earth and corporate bodies or that time yes sir we will have our glorified body right here on earth eating drinking building houses here and living just like we do now it for a thousand years it's the honeymoon of the bride and groom Oh beautiful eating and drinking building houses one day bro Scott will be able to build a house I can already build anything right now if I build it's going to fall apart about five minutes well one day by the word of god I'll build a house like I said I might not even need to know the skills if I just be spoken word power they're puppies that right is before I call he'll answer Laurie that's what originally out of the Son of God did right he spoke to word move the trees to bring the card under subjection he wasn't sweat at that time he just speaking the word that's the scripture so the Millennium is the honeymoon right so the ranchers the wedding that's her brother in tells them doubted this evil age Satan got his age by knowledge getting the people to eat for this victory of good and evil notice Satan by his knowledge causing the people in this evil age the equalist tree of good and evil he says that he's building the greatest Christian civilization by its knowledge of good and evil greater Christian silylation but Christ little version word flock bride don't care for his knowledge she keeps Freeman what is it let us talk about her a minute she waits for Lord and his millennial honey boo we're waiting for a honeymoon with our husband that's right when the word groom with the word groom as she is the word pride I like that weird girl word bride but he is calling not to a church group but a people bars day that receives his name engaged in his name going to a wedding to be married to him to become part of him see by predestination see right now we're engaged to Christ right we're married in our salt we're engaged them but when we go to the rafts or the meeting in the air around so that's the wedding that's why we have a wedding supper for three and a half years right except you have the wedding ceremony and you have the wedding supper the reception right and then you have the honeymoon amen that's got this evil age now the scripture says right now we're engaged to him in second Corinthians 11 2 we're engaged to Christ right now we're not physically with them right now when the rapture comes will be physically with them right now we're married in our souls by an invisible Union revelation 74 says but yeah we're right now we're engaged to Christ married in our souls but not physically married because when you get physically married your husband wife are with you all the time right physically will be married once we get new bodies and go in the rapture that's what he says right here to the future home help us Lord there's one here that's called this wedding supper Atlanta's thousand years of millennial reign and then to enter in the city after the honeymoon is over the millennium is merely the honeymoon then she the bride takes his bride groom takes his bride home it's hers her bridegroom his bride oh he's gone to prepare a house since he's become engaged see Jesus got engaged to us and he's going to prepare a Houston future home maybe be true to him who is the word where he is the word regardless of how others trying to sass us keep us away from the Lord Draghi here I got five minutes let it close with a few things here it's my yellow ones okay now this is why I want to close it okay let me give you sow I'll go through these later in full length but here here are some proofs that we're not in the Millennium right now I no lorcin I talked about this one time into your loved ones and thinks no thought we might be the money I'm and so forth like that but here's here's just the Bible proof I think we're not in the Millennium right now some people not to believe that these are the proofs that I can find for those scriptures we've already read the line lab did not lay down together today in peace or else the zoo's would have a lot more you know animals in there what have the separator so much okay but the Bible said the literally light lay down together and feet together office strong the Bible said that also I'm not literally walked upon any action of the wicked right right Satan is still here on the earth yeah but during the Millennium he's found in the bottomless pit four thousand years but he's in the bottomless pit now because I've quotes after the seals her brother branham rebuke Satan says lead the audience Satan so obviously say it was there amongst for the rams meetings trying to discourage his meetings he rebukes eight and say leave the audience the name of Jesus Christ we pray for people with cancer and say Satan leave in the name of Jesus Christ okay so Satan will be here on the earth turn of letting go be locked up i sealed up in the bottomless pit the Millennium is complete peace with Jesus ruling everyday on earth as son of David there's no sin on the earth and the ligaments Jesus not ruling this nation right now he never let that law pass right never homosexuality and transgender he never let that pass all right he's not ruling right now but heroes all the nations with a rod of iron during the bloody the Bible said we build houses as the antitype of the Feast of Tabernacles what houses have you been lately I'm building right do the Bible said you'll build houses right some of you might have and he might have so you brothers but I never had those that they will build houses and brother Dale also says the Millennium will be someday he said someday in the Millennium you not now he says in 1964 okay now here's what I want to close it so bear with me and I'm right i think i'm right at 45 minutes here yeah i got two mins left okay perfect good good he was number 34 yeah here it is yeah Curtis okay now here's I want and with this the foolish version will miss the velineon they'll miss it because they don't have the oil to go to the wedding right got oil to go in the wedding procession quarter not be 20 mater not born again it might be version and I'd be cleaned out and sanctified but they're not filled or baptized with the Holy Ghost and brother brad says the Millennium is greater in importance and Wonder than imaginable here's what he says so he's in church age book it is the second resurrection wearing the five foolish virgins come up notice they reversion they did not have a holy spirit so they missed being at the bride while the five wise we had only become a part of that ride look what he says about the foolish version but these people being separated God loving people and trying to abide in the word listen I don't want to try to abide the word I want to abide in the word that's the difference between the booze and the wise foolish tried they never get there the bride are supposed to get there and achieve and actually dwell and by the word of God amen that's what's program talk teach this they're trying to buy you the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end time they will miss the Millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful and we have ever thought or believed the Millennium is more wonderful than we had ever thought or believed and now i'm going to turn to this one i accidentally cut and pasted and mrs. left out some of these scriptures hey look at this one where the foolish virgins dirt the mud him in the lid of there in the grave the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years so the foolish version their bodies of course Burt their souls must be down in prison it must be waiting in prison he says they're in the grave right yeah they're not born again so they can't go up into the sixth dimension as far as I can tell ramsha there in the grave when the Millennium starts how the unbelievers we take it off to the earth the unbelievers will go down to the Tribulation Period with the sickening virgin and all those others ultimately neighbors and sickening version of the remnant of Israel that's to be taken out so they did not get a part of the millennium now here's our scripture we read early right there's my time okay my mind in 45 minutes just won a few more seconds here we read this earlier these are the ones who reigned or the hood and they're given judgment they set up Thrones and they live in a reign with Christ a thousand years they live and reign with Christ a thousand years was the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished that is the first resurrection now look what it calls those who are the in the in the polonium Blessid and holy so those who actually make it the millennium and live a thousand years build houses plant vineyards all these things they're blessed and they lift their holy and they should be what they should be these two things they shall be priests and kings well Kings are raining there'll be kings and priests upon the earth now brother Graham what i've read doesn't explain too much about what we'll do to during the Millennium other than one I say a 65 set we'll bill will plant won't have it will speak and things will happen but let me show you what he said about what we should do on earth here's the quote I think that any bigger I don't know how did this a member of premier with this app actually that better okay yeah that's a little bit the other bit better okay so he reads King increases from the church age book now I'm gonna underline these things right here we are King spiritual kings oh we're going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual Kingdom did you know that you are to rain right now you're supposed to rule a spiritual Kingdom where you're supposed to rule that in your home you're supposed to rule the spiritual goings-on in your home right and we're supposed to rule the church look what he says here right now I'm sorry let me highlight that that's not let me do it I want to do it like this I'll just go like this right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the world flesh of the devil amen church when you turn down to temptation say no I'm not going to love like we said last Sunday no I'm not going to be greedy though I'm not gonna lie those not gonna cheat or steal your actually raining right now as a king on this earth hey that's what you read over right now sin world flesh and the devil your ruling right now amen showing North is praise and glory showing fourth himself for it is Christ at us willing and doing a svenska pleasure so people wonder what are kings and priests kings or when you bring sin under subjection tell Senor knocking Oh bed that's ruling as a king or king on this earth hey ed I think that's so small but obedience is a major thing obedience is a major thing not giving in to temptation not giving in to the devil's and evil spirits but overcoming them it proves your king if you're a king here by the Amy we're gonna be a king in the Lydians hear the gory hey then if we're king here we'll get King there now I'm here's what he says priests are and made us priests if I'm a priest here I'll be a priest there remember whatever you do in life echoes in eternity rights yeah it's true you reap what you sow Vedas preset yes priest unto him how do we be a priestly gone down offer the spiritual praise of sanctified lips you say God I'm not going to gossip not going to cuss not going to lie not going to do anything evil my lips instead i'm going to offer praise unto god gasps now we're getting into some precip right now on this earth I'm sorry my mother dog keeps textin mercy I need to turn that off side of me there we go here's how you be a priest right now spend your life as a sweet offering into him I know it seems uneventful sometimes but in God's eyes it's a glorious thing here as a king your ruling over sin and you're a priest giving God praise sacrifices with your lips interceding a good petition see when we pray tonight what are we doing we're being priests praise God that's why prayer so important when you pray to proves you are a priest unto God interceding of petitioning God fulfill your word God heal brother so and so God heal sister so and so God intercede God Egypt you're being a priest glory priests and kings under God no longer

other job we're kings and priests upon this earth hey it doesn't appeal to us because we're not a part of that Kingdom or part of the spiritual Kingdom the kingdom of God the kingdom of Jesus Christ we have been recreated in him to be children like under the pot that's and run feet I went 50 minutes so forgive me Oh holiday view don't you love that turn double inning what a glorious time church I think it's all of it so it looks like navy park too but then you can switch over ever you want for Lawrence thank you sir for covered appreciate that by God's grace all we can't even imagine how wonderful it's going to be heavily yeah the food furs you miss it course sinners will miss it though they'll go to hell you know later on if I through judgment but the bride and 144 thousand will be there because they got the seal of God right they're born again let's bow our heads here by a thousand years of peace a thousand years of rest I looking forward to that rest by God's grace amen so church let's spend our time on this earth then being handsome priests let's just pray a prayer here now let's just pray that god help us to rule over sin temptation devil the world as we said it
