I'm thankful to see sister Beatrice tonight let's give her a round of applause praise God we miss you sister God find out Friday is that right well Friday's going to be a sad day for us but it's gonna be a safe day of travel for you by God's grace Romans chapter one start at verse 13 Lord willingness last Wednesday night we ended with verse 12. how Paul desired to establish the people with some spiritual gift and now he moves in here past this is kind of the introduction of the book and then we'll see how chapter one unfolds remember this book was of course to minister to the Jews and Gentiles in Rome and all the differences that have kind of been uh started between them because of the absence of the Jews for five years but we looked at that last week so let's just read verse 13. why don't I read 13 and then we'll read 14 together 14 is really striking in one way Paul calls himself a debtor he owed the people interesting the way Paul approached his ministry verse 13 now I would not have you ignorant Brethren that often times I purpose to come unto you but was let hitherto that I might have some fruit among you also even as among other Gentiles he tells them don't forget that I come to you and had fruit among you and look at verse 14. let's read that together one two three I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise amen may God as blessings work you may be seated Lord willing will look to this thought here tonight trust us this will be a blessing here uh we're looking into the introduction here we've seen some beautiful scriptures here as we've been looking at this verse 5 is what I use we had a prayer at the pole last Thursday morning at Arrowhead and I invited about 20 families guess how many showed up one so maybe they were busy that morning but I'm not going to be discouraged praise God if I'm the only one out there I'm going to pray to Jesus for our school praise God so we're thankful but verse five stuck out to me because it said we've received Grace for the obedience to the faith among all nations Christ wants all nations he wants and he's going to have Believers in every nation and they're going to obey his voice and so we're thankful that we can obey the voice of the Lord tonight praise God and walk with the Lord hallelujah and we saw of course you know we ended with how we serve god with our spirits and then Paul his greatest desire was that he could give some people a spiritual gift some spiritual blessing from the word of God that was his desire and that's I think that's our all of our desires tonight church I want to be more mindful to remember than the service to see if anyone has a leading of the Lord brother or sister preacher or non-breacher if anyone has a leading of the Lord to share a word or to pray for someone or whatever Direction you'd feel led by the Holy Spirit sometimes I forget about that but I want to remember to do that because I'm not the only one led by the Holy Spirit I believe there's a lot of people led by the holy spirit in here praise God because your lives prove it because you stay true to the word of God so I'm going to remember that and the fact that everybody has a leading of the Lord when they are in obedience to God's word amen so we want to look at verse 13. now here at 13 we're just start preaching here by God's grace Paul Paul said that I might have some fruit among you so again we see he once he wants to establish them with gifts Paul wants to see God move in the church so that they're stronger in the faith Hallelujah and I believe you know God has kept our church strong in the faith praise God the only reason someone would not be strong in the faith is because they don't obey what the word of God says right because the word of God is preached I believe it's preaching it's Clarity I believe it's preaching it's Purity praise God and the Bible said when you receive the word it's the engrafted word of God you're connected to the word of God and the word of God is a life-giving resource how many spoke to the rock this week praise God hallelujah amen thank God and the words I do that gives us life when we pray when we make our our requests to run to God we're speaking to the Rock and we know the rock brings forth water praise God the the water comes forth from Christ the spirit comes forth from Christ and we're strengthened in the grace of God hallelujah now 14 is what just was interesting to me uh it just again shows Paul's thoughts here I am a debtor both to the Greeks and The Barbarians so Greeks were educated heathens and barbarians were just uneducated heathens he says I am a debtor to both of them isn't that interesting a debtor now the word debtor means someone who's not yet made amends with someone who's he's injured or one who owes a penalty uh and wants to pay that or someone who owes something so Paul looked at his ministry like I owe it uh to the Heathen to go to the Heathen I owe it to the to the educated to go to the educated right he looked at it like that it's my service it's my duty to go preach to them I owe them something praise God in church if we can look at it like that in a in a Godly way now not not a slavery way not a uh not a well I'm obligated by you know a bad attitude or something like that but I'm here to serve Christ and it's it's my joy to serve other people praise God he said I see myself as a debtor to the Heathen to the educated and of course he'll say to the Jews as well verse 15. so as much as is in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also so you say I'm ready to go anywhere I want to preach you in Rome I want to be I want to come to Rome but I'm ready to go to The Barbarians I'm ready to go to the educated colleges now look at that that's a real humble servant right there I can go down and go to the universities I admire those guys now there's not not a lot of message guys to do it but I admire the preachers that go down to universities I've seen him before when I was in college I was like wow this guy's got a lot of Courage I thought boy I would never have all those answers right on the top of my head like that but all these questions from these Sunday school kids probably get me ready by God's grace or maybe someone ready the thing to do though I feel I really feel the leading of I would need the Holy Spirit to have the scriptures to be able to come to my remembrance I would need for God to prove to me that it's right there you know I've invested enough time in the word of God to be able to point to the scripture because I I can't be like hey wait I need a few seconds let me look up this verse you know I wouldn't you it takes a special gift it really does it takes a special anointing to do things like that and of course that's a burden that's a Ministry someone would have but I admire that I really do admire that like Ray comfort and different ones like that they don't have the Full Gospel but I'm I admire men like that that'll go stand there in the public and stand for Christ I believe God Honors that praise God now verse 16. how many times have we used this in our testimony for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ so I'll go to the Jew I'll go to the Gentile I'll go to the Barbarian I'll go to the educated College University because I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ it's the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek Hallelujah I believe it's the power of God see that's what many churches lack and we've got to make sure that we keep trusting in the power of God in our church amen you can't let down on the power of God we've got to have power and we got to have character amen we've got to have both praise God we've got to have the teaching and we've got to have the power Hallelujah that's what we need by the grace of God Amen this is the power of the god unto me he says unto salvation Deliverance to everyone that believes Hallelujah so the power is there but each person has to make a decision to accept that power to let the power flow through them praise God because remember the Bible said that in the last days they'd be traded or traitors heady high-minded they'd have a form of godliness but denying the power so we got to have the power of God Amen we've got to have the power of God to heal the sick we've got to have the power of God to bring us to repentance praise God we've got the power of God to change our minds and and bring us to a holy State praise God we've got to have the power of God to make us love God more to be more faithful to God Amen hallelujah it's the power of God that does that Hallelujah amen verse 17 for there and what the gospel of Christ the good news of Christ for in the good news is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith now remember we did the bible study on on Sunday night we saw that how well we live we don't live by our works because Church pretty soon we'll get to a spot where we don't do as many works as we think we should do or we get tired or discouraged and we just don't do God's works so we don't live by works the Bible said we live by faith amen right and faith is trust the word means trust in the Greek it means Assurance we live by the Assurance in Christ Hallelujah that's what we live by that and that's why that's why we we have a bad day we know the next day God can make this a great day praise God I don't have to stay back in my past I'm not I'm not a slave to that praise God I don't have to suffer the guilt of that I confess my sins I can move on praise God I have a fresh start because I live by faith Hallelujah Hallelujah I live by the faith that the Bible says blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute iniquity praise God Hallelujah we live by the faith of every promise of God hallelujah and then in humility we say I'm a debtor to other people I'm supposed to serve other people hallelujah not I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ how many not ashamed praise God oh my thank God what a beautiful promise this is and notice we go from Faith to Faith praise God I love whenever God drops a fresh Revelation whether it was on Dancing that's the Revelation I've been living off of lately I just never seen it like that before and so see I live from that so previously that I had some good Revelation I could I couldn't really recall right now but I had some great Revelation in order to preach 17 years you need some Revelation praise God to keep going because Satan's going to battle each one of us to stop our our Ministries so I forget which one I had before that I probably look through my sermon series and see which thought I lived off of or you that's what you do you live off of thought you live off a revelation and then you go to another Revelation praise God and we don't know how long we're going to stay on that thought but we got to keep the word of God fresh we got to keep going back to the Rock Amen we've got to keep thirsting on the things of God hallelujah as we said on Sunday praise God hallelujah we've got to keep polling on God keep seeking God and therein God reveals more of himself to us hallelujah and so I like that here it is he said we've lived by faith and we go from Faith to Faith we need a new measure of faith we need a renewed sense of God's love in our lives amen A Renewed sense of God's faithfulness to us amen verse 18. now here he breaks now into this this next part now we'd say the introduction would be done because he talks about he's you know he greets the Saints and how he longs to be with them and and I'm not ashamed I'll preach anywhere the power of God has to capture my life and now he gets into the guilty World Schofield says he says the wrath of God revealed upon the world now Church let's look at the word wrath it means in indignation it means a temper it means agitated it means a violent emotion or anger now the Bible says we don't suffer the wrath of God anymore in first Thessalonians 5 read it a few weeks ago so I'm not going to read that tonight but church we are not under the wrath of God God's not angry at us and the church said well if he's not angry he's got to be happy then right he's not angry the rat the anger of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men now who's trying to live a Godly life here tonight now who's really trying not really trying see because the world is not even trying and that's why God's anger angered with them because they're not even trying they're living in unrighteousness now those of us uh well all of us at some point were fighting against God whether we got saved at seven or some of us got to save here six or five here by God's grace the prayers of mine I think in prayers of dad the prayers of the family but we all know that at some point we were fighting against God we were not trying to draw closer to God we didn't care about living a righteous life but at some point a change came at some point we heard the good news the gospel that Jesus can forgive our sins and transform us and give us a hope for the future praise God and from that moment we repented and then we started experiencing the power of God Amen unto Deliverance unto salvation praise God so I just want you to see here now look at Paul here as he gets into this here now remember earlier in this chapter don't forget he called you beloved he said the Saints are beloved praise God so he's not talking well you're beloved but yet God's angry at you now we'll get that way right we'll get we'll get angry at the ones we love you have to say Amen we'll get angry at the ones we love more than anybody else I love this person more than anybody else but I still get angry because I'm a human right and I usually I always deserve it if anyone's angry with me it's probably it's my fault usually 99 99.9 of the time it's my fault but with God you know once we're accepted in Christ God doesn't get anger right now the Bible said he gets offended but he doesn't get angry right that's what the Bible says the wrath of God is not against the bride of Christ or the Holy Ghost Field Church but it's revealed from heaven against all ungodliness all the righteous and men who hold the truth in unrighteousness so I want you to uh notice that here wrath comes on those who know the truth but they still preach untruth or they live untruth they know it's righteous but they still choose to live unrighteous and later in this these next two chapters is going to show every person has a sense of what is right and wrong so nobody can say I didn't know I don't know about you know paralyzed people or people that you know uh you say mental troubles I'm not sure about that that'll be up to God and God will always judge Fair but but people that have a conscience and the five inlets of the human spirit and all all are working and active they they know the truth and they either hold it in righteousness or an unrighteousness right now verse 19 here's these are familiar I preached these over the years here especially these last few years but because that which may be known of God is manifesting them for God has showed it unto them wow so they they know the truth because God's made it known to them and he's even showed it to them like brother Adam said I can see God in the in the rainbow that comes out of light shining through an icicle he said I can see God in that amen I can see God's I can see God in the how of an animal or the bark of an animal right or the mating call of a bird or whatever I can see God in that God makes himself known to everybody abundantly all throughout their lives he's making himself known to them praise God they see God's character they see God's nature they see God's power Hallelujah I remember when we preached on the Colossians series and and one Little Star there may look like a star but it actually might be an entire galaxy that one that looks like one star there's billions of stars within that star and then there's billions of galaxies praise God and our heavenly father named every single one of them praise God that's a lot and then he also knows all the hairs on your head if you still got them thank God Hallelujah but now that's a that's a lot of knowledge all those stars and then all your hairs all your hair my hair's your ears over here that that that's and then that God says you're his beloved ah amen amen that God says you pass from Death unto life that God says there's no condemnation to you amen oh that's the kind of God I want to serve amen thank God Amen I got I taught that at the uh the middle school Bible study on Tuesday morning you know Ephesians 1 4. I did a Bible trivia and I said when did God choose you to be saved they said at the cross I said that's a good guess but it's before that and pretty soon they got back how about at Creation in the Garden of Eden I said that's a pretty good guess but it was long before that and they're like I don't know and then one boy he's in the fifth grade and he goes to uh did not make a church over here in the Fair Lawn and they said be basically said it's because God loves us and he wants us to know that he's never going to leave us or never forsake us I said God bless you little Carter amen that's exactly right praise God if you know he chose you before there ever was a world then you know even if the world Falls you're still his child you're still chosen his mind and you'll still be with him if there's never a world anymore but we know the world is going to remain it's just going to get a renovation praise God and you then you and I get to live on the world Amen a renovated world with no devil no Satan no sin no temptation only Holiness and righteousness amen that's the kind of God I want to serve right there amen God showed it unto them God showed it to us like I always tell people I saw God heal my mama cancer of incurable liver cancer in the second grade and how was I ever going to deny there was a God how could I ever do it it was impossible even though I had sinned I went into sin in fifth grade and on and on until I was 19. it's still that whole time no one could tell me nobody could tell me there was no God because he showed himself to me but if he never would have done that I still would have known by all the creation and design in the universe right all the you know Charles Darwin said there was no God and there was Evolution and he said the smaller an object gets uh the less complex it is and we find out it's just the opposite the smaller something is the more complex it is right and then think about that splitting it out and look at the power and splitting one atom look at that power look what happened to Hiroshima Nagasaki by splitting an atom think about that and that's just one and your body's Nature's filled with atoms look at the power that God packed in a small package amen my goodness gracious and then he says if you've got faith like a mustard seed he said you can speak to this mountain and it will move praise God Amen Hallelujah a rubber band broke in my mouth I thought it hit something laughs now verse 20. all right sorry I had to go to the orthodontist yesterday for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen invisible things are clearly seen yes invisible principles are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse so we see God's eternal power in the atom you can blow up hundreds of thousands of people with splitting one atom right be power how about the power of maintaining all those bins and trillions of stars how about the power in that you see his eternal power Hallelujah and you see the godhead so any threes father son only goes I got a whole list of them in my book all the threes in nature there's threes all kinds of things I can't think of them now but there's threes everywhere anytime there's a three somewhere it's the godhead God is talking godhead morning noon and evening right I mean there's so many you can just go on and on all the threes in the world is speaking godhead godhead godhead Hallelujah all the power you see around the world God's power God's infinite God's even greater than this even the power we see God's greater than that praise God amen because so there's no excuses on the day of judgment judgment God shows it to everybody so Church let's hold the truth with righteousness because the Wrath comes on those who know the truth and they do despite the truth verse 21 because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we're thankful that's why Thanksgiving day is so important it's not coming to church and giving God praise is so important the unrighteous that get the wrath of God they will not give God thanks see why it's important to raise your hands and clap your hands see I get a holy jealousy when I see people shout and scream at basketball or football games I get a holy jealous they're like why are you worshiping that there's nothing even in that and it makes me more just want to come here and give God praise amen because I wasted so many hours doing that but it proves that they're God it proves that we're going to see they made a creation to God instead of the creator of the god that's right so they know God that God showed himself to them but they do not glorify him as God neither were they thankful they became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened remember the Bible says the light has risen in your heart remember the Bible says that the son of righteousness has risen with healing in his wings the Bible says Jesus Christ and the day star has risen in Your Heart Church think about that your soul is in darkness but one day light shine in there praise God the sun came up on your Blackness amen oh look how bright it is even now that's how bright your soul is amen praise God your heart is not darkened praise God your heart has the light of God it's got not just a natural light these will burn out it's got an eternal life praise God oh but Sinners their hearts get darker and covered with Darkness the Greek says the Bible said the blinded he blinds their minds right we looked over that a few weeks ago now look at verse 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools now churches we how many believe you're a wise virgin see I I if someone asked me I'll profess that but it's not something we brag on but if they ask me are you wise or foolish version I believe I'm a wise Virgin by God's grace not that I'm bragging but and then brother bran tells us you'll never live above your confession if you always say I'm the weakest Christian he said you're going to remain the weakest Christian right if you always say I can't overcome this you're never going to overcome it because that's not Faith talking right faith is a revelation Faith tells you you can go from Faith to Faith amen Faith tells you I can go higher praise God Hallelujah Faith tells me that I could get the victory Faith tells me there's greater things ahead praise God I can I can go higher in Christ I can increase praise God I can add to all these anointings in my life I can get a fresh anointing praise God hallelujah praise God Amen but see Sinners claim to be wise and they become fools I always loved that Ray come for a video where he goes to the USC and he asks all these uh uh he has all these Evolution guys can you give me one example of evolution he's like I can give you thousands he rage just said just give me one he said the stickleback fish he says what were they before they evolved he said they were sticklebacks he said what were they after they're still sticklebacks he said that's not darwinian evolution Darwin evolution is changing from a stickle fish to an alligator or something like something like and he's like they claim they're so they're claiming to be so wise but then they CA they say I've got thousands of examples and they can't even come up with one praise God ah what just about these people like the Bible said they just hold the truth of God in unrighteousness praise God or the finches Darwin's finches they said they evolved and Ray said well what were they before he said they were finches what were they after they involved one of their finches with different beaks he said they're still finches and that obeys God's word because God's word says kind comes after from kind praise God you'll never see a monkey produce a man right as we went over a number of years ago we went over those proofs how uh evolution is is nonsense but see they they claim to be wise they got phds and all these things they have all these claims but they have no proof ah they become fools my and I appreciate men like I don't know why I'm on Ray Comfort tonight but uh Ray Comfort proves they're fools Hallelujah verse 23 and they change the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made like two corruptable men see anything someone worships other than God it's going to become corruptable it's going to get old it's going to get uh it's going to fall apart right it's going to get it's going to get corruptable and they worship the Bible said Birds four-footed beasts creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts so see remember they had darkened hearts and now we know they got lusts in their hearts so now we know how it gets dark right they feed their lusts and it dishonors their own bodies between themselves now here we're starting to get into the depths of sin here and now we start to see homosexuality right I'll never forget when one of our members here uh younger brother come to me years ago and said what do you think about it right about 2015 right when they legalize a younger brother come to me and said brother Jesse what do you think about homosexuality and these people are telling me it's okay and I was like have you ever read the New Testament let's read that and so we went there in a Bible study I showed the brother where the Bible says the Romans says it in Timothy says it all uh Corinthians it says Paul says at least three or four times right and uh I don't know where the brother stands today but Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever right and so now we see a a people that know the truth and despise it call themselves wise but they're fools then they start dishonoring their bodies sexually right verse 25. who changed the truth of God into a lie like they say oh God made me this way God I was born with these desires no you weren't it's impossible God doesn't make God doesn't make mistakes like that and the one guy Bruce Jenner even blamed God he said God did this I remember that on an interview he said this is God's fault God don't make no mistakes they change the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forevermore amen they'd rather worship men and women they'd rather worship money riches and civilizations they'd rather worship anything but God oh but you ought to feel blessed that you're worshiping the god of the universe tonight praise God Amen You've Got A sound mind praise God you're holding the truth in righteousness you know the truth and you're obeying the truth praise God oh now because they did this verse 26 God gave them up unto vile affection so now you know what uh homosexuality is it's a disgrace it's a shame it's a vile it's a reproach it's a shameful affection for even their women to change the natural use into that which is against nature verse 27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burn in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of the air which was meat now I was shocked to hear this but I heard a preacher saying I gotta look it up but he said the average lifespan of a homosexual man in the U.S is 40 years old and it's not always because of AIDS because that's they got more message medicines now I guess to deal with that but that's the average age remember during covid uh all the the suicides went up and then now the the trans Community they have a very high rate of suicide and the Bible says they'll receive in themselves the of the recompense the payback for The Heirs that they've done they know the truth of God they know the word of God but because they go against the word of God they don't worship God as a Creator because they won't obey the truth then God has to give them God has to let them uh sow what reap what they sow think about that 40 years old is the average age and I told the brother too when we did the Bible said I said why he said why is it so bad it goes against God's design it's telling God your design is not right because God has natural body parts to work natural ways right and when you go up when you go the same gender which there's only two genders of course they change the truth of God into a lie then it doesn't it's unnatural and the Bible calls it a disgrace vile a dishonor I don't care how nice they are they've got Demons Inside of them praise God they're just religious demons which can be the worst sometimes look at the Pharisees two full more sons of Hell than uh their their their converts were twice as awful as they were and look what we've just seen since 2015 some people thought oh all they want in 2015 they just want homosexuality to be okay and now look where it's got now transgender and then children having surgeries at Young ages and being cats right children people think they're cats in the school system which she saw Emma saw it right they had kitty litter in the right the bathroom unbelievable in public schools well I'm a cat so I need a what do they call it lit kitty litter box or something like a litter box unbelievable and church we're not we're not bashing them in that way but we're giving a warning signal the Bible said come out of her praise God Hallelujah the Bible said warn every man praise God but this is why the wrath of God comes because the people know the truth God shows them the truth God shows it over and over in themselves and nature shows them everywhere and they change the truth of God into a lie because of their lusts oh my If people could just learn to crucify their lust and realize the pleasure doesn't last it gets harder and harder to maintain and fulfill the lust but if they just crucify that they'd experience a very true Joy of God hallelujah ah they could just once dance like we danced they can just once feel the joy of the Holy Spirit they'd scream for hours amen how do I know because we just scream for hours amen that's how I know praise God Hallelujah and even did it on four hours of sleep by God's grace oh my God the joy and the pleasure of serving the lord amen oh Look What the Lord Has Done Hallelujah the gospel the good news so see it's payback for homosexuals in God's sight God pays them back now again just like the Bible said I said on Sunday some men sins they pay for him now and other men's sins are hidden and then they'll get a worse punishment later I don't know if it worse or not but I shouldn't said that but somehow they're gonna their sins are gonna be exposed now verse 28 and even as they did not like to retain God in their house see that's the thing they just don't want to think about the word they don't want to meditate on the word of God they know it's right they know it's true God showed it to them but they don't want to retain the word of God in their knowledge that retain means to hold to wear it to possess it to hold fast to regard as good to possess hallelujah how many possess the word of God here tonight Well church you're going to possess something Hallelujah you ought to possess God's word because there's power in the word of God Amen there's life in the word of God there's victory in the word of God there's healing in the word of God everything good is in the word of God hallelujah retain God in your knowledge be careful like Austin I talked about this you know years ago we got to be careful how much podcast we listen to we got to be careful how much YouTube we listen to if it's not the word of God we've got to retain God's word I'm sorry God's word in our knowledge in our in our spirit praise God to meditate on that now look at verse 28 because they refuse to focus on God's word then God gave them over now this word gave means to deliver up to give into the hands of another so think about that at one time God was having Mercy but then when they reject God over and over then God just hands them over to Satan God just says I can't do anything more with you gives them over to Satan he says God gave them over to a reprobate mind that means a rejected mind not standing the test so when people fail the test of God constantly day after day showing I'm alive I'm your creator here's my design I'm real I'm undeniable my design is everywhere my love is everywhere amen thank God my truth is everywhere I praise God when they fail the test God gives them over to Satan to do the things which are not convenient that means that is fit see so we don't those are people that go against the design of God now got a few things here I want to share by God's grace I'm going to get to this I thought I would it's kind of where I felt a little inspired here now look at this so Church everybody knows the truth whether it's Barbarian whether it's educated man Jew Gentile everyone knows the truth about God Hallelujah when they reject God's word then they have to be filled with something brother man said you leave here fill with something oh God fill us with the Holy Ghost amen fill me with the power of God hallelujah when I leave here hallelujah he said being filled with all unrighteousness unrighteousness means iniquity violation of the law see they constantly violate God's word fornication of course we know that's any acts before marriage wickedness which means depravity malice evil purposes or desires everything's evil everything's a sinful selfish desire wickedness covetousness of course that's Desiring what a greedy desire to have more they're filled with more I need more I gotta have more maliciousness which is naughtiness ill will desire to injure I want to hurt brother so and so I want to hurt sister so and so on and make them look bad or I want to make them suffer like they made me suffer maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity and Whispers let me look up some of these Envy means prompted to Envy so jealousy murder is the one I'm going to look at here in just a moment here uh debate let's look at debate it is a contention remember there's good debate and there's bad debate because Paul reasoned in the synagogues every Saturday that Jesus was the Christ Paul had a lot of debates I believe he won all of them praise God now he didn't win always all the souls but he won the debate praise God because God's word don't don't fail you can't you can't lose a debate was God's word amen hallelujah do you see malignity malignity is bad character craftiness so think about Sly people I got some of those in my class you know I'm praying for them by God no crap no they'll I've seen it this week they'll wait till I turn around then they'll stick their tongue out of people I'm like I saw that that's a minute recess you owe me you gotta write apology note you're in debt to me whispers are secret Slanders well don't tell the sister this but I'm gonna do this and that's all because they rejected God's word Church it ought to be so good you got to be so happy if this doesn't describe you praise God amen that means you're filled with God hallelujah if you're not filled with this you're filled with God hallelujah amen thank God because they wouldn't retain the knowledge of God I'll try to finish this chapter and I'm going to go back in look at that murder just for a moment here spiders haters of God a backbiter is an evil speaker of course we know what talking behind somebody's back is despiteful which is a one who's lifted up in Pride insulting language when you insult people so that despiteful insulters proud we know someone that's over top of others they're preeminent they're more important than other people boasters are empty Pretenders they pretend they can do things right Pretenders sorry I lost my spider I clicked the wrong thing inventors of evil things and disobedient to parents so now children see why brother Jess has to talk to you about obeying your parents the first time right I got to get that it's my duty to get that taught to you obey your parents right that's the first first promise I'm sorry first commandment with promise God will give you a long life on the Earth praise God and if you can if you can obey someone you can see then surely you can obey God who you can't see right that's that's the proof of love if you obey someone that you see surely you can obey God whom you can't see that's what the Bible says Hallelujah but this group that goes against God's word is disobedient to parents without understanding they really they say they're wise but they have no understanding Covenant Breakers of course marriage covenants Oaths promises without natural affection see that's where they get into the homosexuality and my wife didn't even talked about it even people that don't have a natural affection for a baby and they'd go they support abortion like Billy Graham like how is that possible supporting abortion they don't have the natural feelings you have right now implacable let me look that up I don't remember that one it's a truce breaker so someone uh that cannot be persuaded to enter into Covenant so again that'd probably be people that don't don't get married or won't get married right unmerciful who knowing the Judgment of God look they know every they all then they know these are all commandments that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them always remember that picture from a few years ago they had like an award show for all the heathens and they actually sang it was like a movie star or music industry and actually sang this song called Highway to Hell and they have all these people with they had devil horns on and they got their devil horns up and they're singing Highway to Hell and like and the songs like when I get to hell I'm gonna party with my friends who'll do no such thing they will suffer unbelievably right they'll scream and cry out for any Mercy but because they had no mercy on this Earth they'll be shown no mercy in hell thank God for the mercy of God thank God that you love the knowledge of God that you love the word of God that you love to retain God's word in your mind praise God in other words thank God you've passed the test Hallelujah these have failed the test they're unapproved they haven't passed the test but you and I have passed the test praise God Amen we are given the choice eternal life or or lovers of God lover is a pleasure we became lovers of God hallelujah oh my thank God am I wearing you out tonight am I wearing anybody out tonight all right bless you no even though they know death is going to come because of their sins they still do the sins and have pleasure in them now I want to go back to that verse uh full of murder the scripture yeah I believe it's verse 29. now I just thought this might be helpful here I'm going to try to bring this down and close in a little bit you're not you can switch over here I just want to show a few things here I've been working on this video of course you know we got the podcast defending the message and so forth and I've always tried to defend the message now when I was I was studying this I've been studying recently on Jim Jones how many know who Jim Jones is anybody know nobody knows okay uh well I'll just give you a little background well um well just to tell you who he is he was a preacher who who eventually led a thousand people to South America to start their own uh Utopia but then uh he did he did the uh cyanide laced Kool-Aid and killed over 900 people in 1978 so this is when I read that full of murder I thought what I thought I've been studying on this so recently as you know there's two main groups that attack the message believe the sign and then now uh the grandson of one of the former pastors of Branham Tabernacle I'm trying not to call names but they watch well I'm praying for you guys always always pray for them well recently I did a series on Jim Jones and and said that and said that brother random is responsible for what Jim Jones did now I want to just explain this a little bit here so hopefully ever you understand it um Jim Jones was raised by uh you know parents that didn't go to church and to make a long story short uh he became a gospel preacher uh and you know from even from his childhood everybody noticed something was wrong with him maybe he was neglected and abused or something I can't remember all the details but he became a gospel preacher okay first he was I think in Methodist and then he convinced his wife to to go to the Pentecostals uh well then he went to the Assemblies of God and became now somebody's God that was the denomination I was raised in and then he got heard of Brothers Ministry now the thing that everybody liked about Jim Jones he had a church about 300 or 100 or something like that is that he was one of the first churches in Indiana to invite blacks and whites together Indiana used to be like the head of the KKK Indiana used to be but Jim Jones is one of the first and he got nine children some of them were adopted and and he called himself the rainbow family because he had black children white children they adopted and so he started out as seemingly as a nice person and in 1957 or 56 and 57 he had joint meetings he had brother Branham come and preach at his services okay that's a picture he's known because he wears those sunglasses like Elvis that's how he's known like you'll see his picture around and because he was a mass murderer and uh so as The Story Goes On he had uh he invited brother Graham to preach at his church and you can listen there's one sermon that they have they have recorded a brother I'm preaching there from 1956 and I'm going to get to in just a little bit I'll share some of the things but uh brother Adam's accusers say that in those interactions that somehow brother Branham influenced him to do what he ultimately did it's the biggest bunch of trash that I've heard in a long time because as I went and studied now Church I got to know what I'm talking about so I went back and listened to some of his speakings I'm not going to call them sermons they're not even sermons by 1965 Bill Brown's death well I'm sorry in 1957 he totally suffered himself from Brother Branham totally and he went into his own uh his own he basically started he went independent but by 1965 when brother Ram died he'd already told his wife and this is the testimony of the family he didn't even believe in God anymore right and then he gave a false prophecy to his church that nuclear uh Warheads were going to hit I think in 1957 in Indianapolis so he moved his church out to California well the prophecy came and went and he was a false prophet now out in California was where he started all this really really awful Sid I believe it was 1965 he moved out to California if I'm not mistaken and so he had all these churches I'm sorry maybe three or four churches around the area but I listened to a sermon from 1971 in 1971 he was saying he was God in flesh now Church do we what do we know about Jesus Jesus was God in flesh but I've got the sermon I'm going to share with the people uh you know on YouTube eventually I got the sermon Jim Jones says he he was he was the god that the same God that walked in the plains of mammary with Abraham he says I am he says I am and people are shouting dancing unbelievable now any any person just at that point any person knows brother I've never taught that that nonsense and the loudest cheers and he even says in the sermon he says our hero is not the president Our Heroes now this he said our hero is socialism he didn't even say Jesus so by 1971 he's saying I'm God and the hero socialism not Jesus by 1975 all the family members I watched some of their testimonies he was abusing people he was electrocuting people as torment and just the there's a I've tried I gotta watch my words here uh the depravity of which he he stooped to is the sickest thing you could ever you could ever think of let me just share a few things that I can share he was against the nuclear family so he would let couples that were married have relationships with others and let people have relationships physically even though they're not married well anybody knows that's an awful sin and people will not inherit the kingdom of God anyone that says he you know he was influenced by Brother Graham they're a liar if they go listen to what he said this is this is the this is the this is why this struck me he's the example of disobeying Romans 1 he's the example of obeying Romans 1 praise God Amen Hallelujah brother man was faithful to his wife right all the love of God flowing out of brother around giving himself the prayer and Ministry and serving the people praise God my a faithful testimony and what is it it's like a modern Judas Iscariot you come in the presence of the truth and then you don't retain the truth another one this ought to touch the sisters and show how Wicked this guy was from the from right there in the early 70s he would try to separate the young children from their parents and they'd cry and scream and he said no you gotta do they got to be independent he was breaking the bonds of the family so they would all look to him he's the leader he he's he's all in charge you can question him you couldn't do he was unquestionable that's why that Spirit that's on Jefferson Bill was the same one that's here because you could not question him and Jeffersonville says you can't question anything on the tapes see how the and I told the guys I said this is caught like behave this is cult-like behavior when you when you can't question somebody and they're always and they're always right and everything they say is from God you've now developed a cult you're now worshiping a man we shouldn't worship the creature we should worship the Creator praise God and so easy example and Church by the end of his life now these are yeah these are dead bodies 900 up 909 if I'm not mistaken he proved to be full of murder where he proved to be fought a victory praise God for the truth full of the gospel and sisters there I'm living proof amen hallelujah thank God Amen I'm living prove amen that this is what the message produces praise God it produces life and victory and peace and all the fruits of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah when you obey the word of God when you really listen to what a preacher says you get the benefits of that when you retain God's knowledge you get God's power hallelujah oh thank God Amen Hallelujah he was arrested by doing awful sexual sins in theaters and everything and he his secretary would set up all these awful events sexually with all with many of the members he would also make make them all give their money to him and it was socialism like everybody got the same amount of money and they would use that scripture we had all things in common in the book of Acts we'll see how the devil slips in there that's without understanding right I mean there's so many awful things he did but by the end the government was catching on to him so in I believe it was 77 or 78 he finally moved down there he had the his followers set up this uh this camp out there I'm not sure I can't remember the word and as soon as he got there things just got worse and worse and worse and church I listened to some of the sermons it was some of the most filthy things I've ever heard in my life he was cussing like the worst sailor you have ever heard and I had to say what and and then now these people have the audacity to say that brother Branham produced that brother Brandon produced this Amen brother Brandon produced that hallelujah amen that's what he produced he produces sister Beatrice amen and a brother William praise God I'm what brother Brandon produced Hallelujah because I believe the Bible that brother brand was preaching praise God hallelujah because I'm God's beloved hallelujah amen so are you thank God Amen so here's a man full of murders because he did not retain in all those sermons I didn't even hurt I'm not even sure if I heard him the name Jesus and I think he could listen to four or five sermons again socialism socialism is the hero he destroyed the nuclear family took the children from the mothers allowed fornication foul language people would even stand up in the in the they'd have these discussions and talk about how they they wish they could hurt and kill their family members that didn't file their cult and he would he would agree with it that was way before the actual murders and even you you know don't don't do it I don't encourage you to do it but even they he recorded his last moments before everybody took the cyanide lace Kool-Aid and he was some people were standing up trying to convince him not to do it and he said just do it you'll have peace he said you can't live without me because he thought he was God right and this is what so this is the epitome of Romans 1. someone that goes against the word of God in the bad sense in the negative sense does it retain God in their knowledge and becomes God becomes the object of worship I think he died with 26 million dollars and everything was everything was centered around him and he was the final Authority and that's cult mentality that's cult mentality now let me read the warnings here you can I'm gonna take this off I looked at the only only sermon brother random preached to him that's on tape let me read some of these warnings here that brother bam gave I'm almost done here yeah Joan says he's God he says you can become God he was the god in the plains of mammary he'd electrocute people to torment them they had just I mean they had holes in the ground they would keep people locked up in isolation all kinds of wickedness now yeah here's where so here in 1956 here's what brother random preached now at the beginning he greets Jim Jones He said happy to see today our host Pastor brother James Jones from Indianapolis back there and he said certainly it's a privilege today to speak to such a host of people and I'm expecting to live an eternity within glory and have the privilege today to be standing to speak to you in fellowship with you around the word of God and it certainly is a privilege to do this didn't Jesus call Judas friend even on the night of his arrest so here's eight or nine warnings I'll try to go fast here I'm gonna wear anybody out the first warning is and he said and the pastor was weakened enough to let them get by with it talking about letting Hollywood in the church if you cry out against the thing the whole church has one big United Army then it would have ceased a long time ago so brother Graham calls out weak pastors and churches look at their videos if you look at the videos all the women got short hair they're wearing pants this man was not influenced by brother you can hear Brothers preaching up to the very end of his life amen simple modesty standards praise God he didn't believe the message he might have believed it for a few days or a few weeks or months or whatever but he didn't live it praise God but you and I we hear the word of God we're not hearers only we're doers of the word of God the second warning he's talking about sexy clothes which they wore it's on video you can watch it the women he says and now he rebuked sexy clothes he says I don't know whether the pastor will appreciate that or not and here's a man who ended up being a sexual pervert later on with hundreds and hundreds of immoralities but I'm telling you my sister at the Judgment bar I have to answer for it if I don't say these things I don't care how many people say liberation of women that's what he said dude James said Jim Jones was saying liberation of women that's a doctrine of the devil that's not in the Bible in other words women uh undressing was liberating them they can show their their form and and be sexy and all these things but remember said that's of the devil and I don't know if the pastor will appreciate that or not of course he didn't because he left brother Ram's message the third warning is that pastor Pastor should teach these things to you he said when the Christian Church went to God acting like the world you know your history or your pastor should teach it to you third warning to Jim Jones number four on makeup he says these little paint up Jezebels the same way you shouldn't do that shame on the pastors that fail to say that in their Church and what did Jim Jones have about a church full of pain and face women the fifth warning now look at this he Compares a weak Pastor to ahab's false prophets who told him to go up to his death now isn't that something and Jim Jones was the one who led all these people to their death talk about the spirit of God warning Jim Jones he says what do you say about it Pastor well I'll tell you I believe we'd better yes I think we ought to go up to raymoth Gilead what about the superintendent what does he say the pastor is compared to the false prophets that led Ahab to his death and Jim Jones was the false prophet that led the people to their death right there right on the tape that's just the fifth warning there's more Church the sixth warning the pastor needs to stay stay with the word if not your pastor's wrong he says he says now look Jim Jones is sitting there he said I don't care what the pastor says the word says so let's stay on the word and all most of these people just let brother man go on and they stayed true to Jim Jones and lost their lives for it because God's Prophet warned them that was the sixth time number seven this is all in the same sermon he says Pentecost they're afraid to speak the truth right I don't care if it hurts the pastor or who it hurts it's God's Eternal Word look at him standard Church look at him and stand there praise God and call them right right and wrong wrong and he has to leave it up to everybody God leaves it up to everybody make your choice let's choose life that we might live Hallelujah oh my to think of it God and His Mercy sent the prophet of God to Jim Jones to try to get him on track before he'd go off track and be full of murder and full of adulteries and full of wickedness maliciousness all these filthy words God and His Mercy sent the prophet does it remind you of anybody ought to remind you of Herod right Herod was a lover of pleasures married twice God still sent John the Baptist there to give him a chance because of God's love he said I don't care if it hurts the Pastor Jim Jones I don't care you have to speak God's truth see that's why I love defending this message I don't know if I told you but I believe I was born to defend this message praise God hallelujah I know I just do it in a real small way but that's okay God like small small people too praise God 's got a place in heaven for small people Hallelujah the eighth warning he says he's talking about Cain bringing the false uh worship the false sacrifice he said the flowers and everything Cain decorated his altar he worship God a true picture of the carnal church member today and the carnal-minded pastor who wants a church that sits higher than the rest of them in the city and all their seats all plush and million dollar pipe organ and everyone can tell by the all the result all the history searches Jim Jones when his church would get small because of his lies he'd go out and he'd perform fake miracles to try to get more people to come in and he build up his church again he basically what he did he copied Brothers his sermon but he would plant people in the in the in the sanctuary to pretend they got healed and then through that he would control them because they saw they saw somebody get off a stretcher but it was pretending the whole time it was just his secretaries and his workers and then he lead him into sexual sin money laundering all this wickedness and brother man warned him a carnal pastor wants all that he died with 26 million dollars and the people were starving there like they they worked 16 hours a day on that compound it's supposed to be paradise it turned out to be not Paradise torture and then a ninth warning he said uh Dr so-and-so he's a classic man oh do you know how he speaks in two or three different languages he does all this and all that you know what he Pastor the great so-and-so church one time now isn't that something he said that's who he prayed to the denomination not to Christ and Jim Jones after this went into the denomination of the Disciples of Christ and brother and warned him don't go into nomination right there and he went into the denomination of the Disciples of Christ warned nine times now the church that tells me that's the love of God sent you a prophet signs wonders and miracles discernments genuine discernments and turned it down so in closing I want to after all those negatives I saw some of your faces you should have saw my face when when I was listening to something like I thought honestly Lord God who in their right mind could honestly compare brother Branham to Jim Jones there is no comparison there is absolutely no comparison because look at the fruits of both men's Ministries hallelujah thank God thank God Amen amen's life and a man Ministry we are you are the fruits oh hallelujah amen you're the fruits your lives your lives of Holiness your lives of power your lives of the Gospel amen your lives of Victory your lives of chain breaking Miracle working promise keeping God in flesh God ministering Christ in us the hope of glory praise God not the fullness of God but a small measure of God Christ in us in a small measure doing the same works the works that I do shall ye do also praise God Hallelujah thank God see church we have an obvious example here's what happens when someone retains the word of God in their thoughts brother random and here's what happens when someone doesn't retain their thoughts in the word of God full of murder full of adultery but over here brother Ram Bull of the Holy Ghost full of the love of God full of the revelation of the mysteries of God hallelujah oh that we live by today thank God Hallelujah what'd the Bible say the Bible said when we receive Christ we are partaking of The Fellowship of the mystery the intimacy that fellow worship Fellowship means intimacy I preached on that years ago the intimacy when Christ reveals the mystery of the godhead or the mystery of even the mother Harlot church or the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it brings you to an intimacy with Christ that other people don't know about right praise God how many uh how many are testimony to that that people recognize there's something different about you there's something different about your children people tell me all the time there's something different about your children brother Jesse thank God all those sermons all that spitting all that preaching praise God really it's Mom at home though really that's the reality of it by God's grace but church I know there's a difference because I was a sinner I was a full-blown sinner for all those years of my teens you know and then I was a full-blown denominational Church man but now I'm a holy ghost-filled saying praise God full of the word of God I know the difference I've experienced a difference let's close to this I'm closing with it right now give me two more verses here uh go to pull up there honey first Peter 1. verse verse two we read this when we did the predestination study a few weeks ago we are elect we're chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience so why does God why does God choose you to obey the word of God to retain the knowledge of God unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ that's his life that's his spirit being sprinkled you're freshly Anointed with the spirit Grace unto you and peace be multiplied now go down to verse 5. this beautiful scripture my Church who is even keeping you say brother Jesse well I haven't done a miracle right I haven't seen a miracle in a while Well church there's different kinds of Power that power will show up brother remember said the Supreme faith will show up at the Supreme hour praise God oh amen praise God in other words when God wants to move God's going to make sure that he moves praise God but all this time who's been keeping me 17 years of preaching since 2001 who's been keeping me in the message I'm kept by the power of God Hallelujah sister Beatrice who's been holding you all these 40 years Hallelujah it hasn't been your power hasn't been man-made theology it's been the power of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says it's the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in this last time and what is faith faith is a revelation also what is Faith it's a gift of God it's a gift that God gave to you praise God I'm kept by God's Gift amen I didn't earn it I just repented God gave it to me and now that Faith keeps me in the faith Hallelujah it keeps me full of God's love it keeps me full of the word of God it keeps me full of Holiness it keeps me full of righteousness praise God oh that's what God's word does amen Hallelujah who's keeping you brother Jess the power of God's keeping me Hallelujah like that song says something keeps holding me Church something keeps holding me every day that I see praise God who's going to hold you young people when brother Jess gets old and he can barely preach anymore come on young people preach come on believe the word of God I got to hang up my or hang up my coat someday and hand my Bible to somebody no pressure Malachi might be awesome who knows Zion amen who's going to be who's going to keep us all these years brother Jesse are you going to keep me I wish I could but I can't even keep myself here I can't even keep myself Christ is keeping me Hallelujah and Christ is going to keep you as well praise God Hallelujah retain his knowledge retain this truth worship the Creator praise God trust in the Living God hallelujah amen last scripture you're kept by faith the Bible says by faith you're cut by the power of God Ephesians 6 16 you all know this you probably recite it after I speak it above all taking the shield of you're kept by faith in the power of God and above all keep your faith keep the shield of God's word where and you should be able to quench some of the fiery Darks of the wicked not some not 90 not three quarters a hundred percent think of the every think of that Satan Every Lie he tries to get you with everyone God's already given you the shield where you don't have to worry about it I know as long as I stay behind this Shield God's Gonna protect me praise God there's not a weapon he's got brother awesome there's no weapon that's formed against us that shall prosper Hallelujah he don't like like to say he don't have enough he don't have enough arrows because I've got a greater weapon I've got the word of God faith is keeping me Faith is my power faith is my shield Christ is my shield Christ is my life he's my victory praise God let's say into our feet he's my power and take the helmet of salvation musicians can come protect your mind with the helmet of salvation I'm saved Jesus loves me I'm the Beloved he died for me nobody else wants to received out there in the world we'll receive it praise God I was the one he came for praise God when he was on the cross I was on his mind oh my God Amen thank God for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame Hallelujah the Bible said he would see his seed after the resurrection he would see his church all the fiery darts of the wicked the gift of faith were kept by faith God will keep you in every trial God will protect you in every situation praise God how many already know he does that already praise God in every situation when it seems like he's not protecting a church he's protecting him in every situation I always wonder that how can my friends in high school before I was saved how can they go so far into certain drugs and certain things and I could never go God was protecting me I went certain ways you know I want certain lengths but how come I could never go as far as them because God's grace was upon my life God had a plan he foreknew what was going to happen praise God Hallelujah thank the Lord for his grace and mercy let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer first let's leave here reminding that there's no weapon that's formed against you that shall prosper you have a defense for every attack from Satan you've got faith you've got Trust you have the Blessed assurance Jesus Is Mine oh what a foretaste of Glory divine air of Salvation purchase of God born of a spirit I'm washed in his blood no church I said some pretty plain things here tonight but I thought it fit really good with Romans chapter 1. thank God we are what brother Ram's message has produced Hallelujah I take a group like this of just three four five six seven eight ten minutes 16 people I take this over a church of three thousand any day as we've got the righteousness of Christ here we've got Christ righteousness we've got Christ's faith we got the love of Jesus Christ here we've all experienced the power of salvation the power of the Gospel unto salvation let's bow our heads in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just want to thank you for tonight Lord God or some of these things are really tough to say more than I even hate to bring it up before when I study these things I think Lord have mercy how can these people 's awful statements but Lord I remember Satan is the accuser of the brother well it turns this is what I forgot to preach I want to preach this Satan knows he can't defeat the message so he's got to attack the messenger the message is perfect the message is the word of God so he's got to look at the human elements
