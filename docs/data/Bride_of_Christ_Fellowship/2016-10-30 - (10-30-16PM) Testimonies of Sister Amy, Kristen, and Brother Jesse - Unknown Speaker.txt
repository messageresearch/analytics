this an april now i'm just get to it down here not so per second there's a diamond season for everything praise the Lord sorry this here it's in my testimony sorry i'm not the one up here reading this but i really get nervous he described any there then end up skipping things I want to say because I just want to hurry up and sit down I was blessed to be raised in a message believing home with very strong Christian parents ninety ninety-five percent of my family believes a message to I'm very blessed with many people to look to for advice prayer encouragement or scripture in sight when I was 12 I wasn't really interested in going to church to listen to the preaching I went because I had to I love seeing everyone to in February 2006 when I was 12 years old my family was an accident my mom and I were the only two hurt which was a miracle because either my brother or my sister had their seatbelts on while my parents and I did and it meant two seconds later my brother would have been thrown from the van and possibly killed but he went unscathed thank the Lord man my mama hurt her wrist and I hit my Hannah on the lock of the door and it went into my head right above my eye which was another miracle that it missed my my my mom and I went into the house and I no idea how badly I've been hurt whether it was really bad or not I was totally calm I was actually calling me my mom dad then I went and looked in the mirror realized it could be pretty bad but with the Lord's help I stayed called as i was looking into the mirror with fear in my heart I told God that if he spared my life I would testify about how he saved my life she said to my shame has taken ten years of sherry Lester turned out that it was just a superficial wound and all I needed was a whole 12 stitches after that something change in my heart I started looking forward to going to church more than just hanging out with my friends and family I had a longing inside at first I wasn't sure what it was it might sound silly but I thought was just craving a certain food or drink eventually I realized it was my need for God in my life it was may of 2006 but my family was coming over for a Memorial Day picnic my grandparents were up and I wanted my grandpa to baptize me I wrote a note to my dad saying I want to be baptized and left it beside him because he was taken in that that evening with most of my family present my grandpa dad baptized me in a creek down the road from our house for a while after that I was on cloud nine nothing bothered me not even my siblings been the trial started because of my previous hurts in life I grew very hard and very cold and distant from God wasn't until I was 17 that I started to get serious about God at that time I worked on a dairy farm but I didn't realize it but there was black mold everywhere I started coughing a little dry cough and then it got worse and went to my chest I thought it was just a bug it would go away it had been about six months when brother Kenneth Walker came to Alby to preach I asked my dad if he would go with me into the office that brother Walker pray for me after brother Walker finished when I went to sit down for the service knowing I was healed after brother Walker finished praying for them I coughed sorry Les Mis fun since I coughed a dry cough maybe two more times and then it was totally gone within a matter of minutes a brainwave being prayed for I just finished my junior year in school that summer everyone in church and my family was talking about how they were going to start being homeschooled I want to be homeschooled so I started asking the Lord of he'd have me to stay in score be homeschooled there was so much profanity diversions and ensue innate in sua nations obviously insinuations thank you our brother branham see my wife is my correction they saw anything sure you might correction there are so much romantic perversions and insinuations that's it at school I constantly had mine battles surrounding what was said or done in school I really didn't feel as though I was being a little testimony of my classmates I never really testified any one and only really talked about what i believed is someone asked or if it was a topic of conversation class in august of 2011 brother Darrell Ward came to preach valving he was talking about how his elder sister was home school but his younger sister was in a public school like me then he said some people are meant to home-school but some are meant to be in school to be alight so I felt that the Lord was telling me to stay in school I did and graduated from 14 years into a public school at the time I was praying for a different job then in August had church someone mentioned a job on a horse farm I caught about the job at the position had been filled then about a month later in October I got a callback that the girl in the position could only work so many hours there was still an opening for someone after work more hours I started the beginning of november working four days a week I was extremely thankful for the job because I had so many perks that my first job I kept praying because I wanted more hours soon I started working five days a week and then six I've been truly blessed of this job and now I'm just on the supervisor I've been in many dangerous situations that work at got his kept me from getting seriously hurt every time from being kicked bit pinned and struck to being half run over and God is always kept me I've also had the opportunity with my boss about the word so 17 I started really seeking God desiring a Holy Ghost brother Jesse came to Albion for a sweetheart bakery in 2012 I believed I was 18 that son he preached on the Holy Ghost and I wanted to go up to the altar but Satan kept telling her I didn't need to go finally I couldn't stand it any longer it felt like something was pulling me up to the altar I know there bawling my eyes out Frank just asking the Lord for Holy Ghost a bench that I felt a piece that I received it when I would that I went up for there is okay the way I saw people immediately changed as I continued to kneel there and just praise the lord I could see the struggle on people's faces I can tell they wanted to come to the belt or two but they didn't after I went back to my seat no sooner had I done that the devil immediately tried to make me start doubting what I adjust test fight so I lost my study yeah I just bow my head and prayed and asked the Lord to vindicate it to me somehow i looked up brother jesse was either just about to pray for someone or just finished pray for someone I don't remember he looked at me and said sister do you feel different I said yes he said you look different I just started thanking the Lord again or what I now knew for sure what he had done for me since then I've had my share of Dallas trials and being lukewarm being raising the message brings a whole different kind of mine battles the devil tells you that you just believe because your parents told you or not if they want to wait you and quickly follow if you're always around your family and it's hard to decipher between or personal walk or if you're just hanging onto someone's your parents cocktails it's difficult to make sure you have your own individual relationship with God or the devil child of you there's no ways genuine because you had it too easy being raised the message and not going through what others had to go through at times you feel this injured in and go through the trials that others that others had to go through I'm sorry at times you feel that since you didn't go through the trials that others day bro came out of the world and maybe you don't appreciate God as much as they do he also tries to tell you that you believe it because that's what you were raised believing so you don't know anything different that if you learned about something else you might believe that over the message deep down God always gives me his assurance of himself and his love for me I hope this helps someone god bless sister Amy [Applause] song warning my morning I wake up to fight the power comfort of contending family season my season I watch him amazed in all of his perfect ways haha loading up his hand will die he's always been faithful to me amen I can't remember what trial or a pain he did not recycle to bring me game I can't remember one single regret in Serbia whoa ah his head will go by either way it's been grateful to you [Music] MSS my soul the theme of the story I heard for so long god helps been faithful he will be his loving company shock it knows no end oh yes it will oh why he's always been faithful he's always been faithful [Music] he's always been faithful to me [Music] [Applause] why was we go into a bar in church so on my family is German Lutheran on both sides so it was art every Sunday religiously but it was religiously today so we were you know we're there my grandparents expected us there then we usually got together as a family afterwards but um how much about your the Lutheran's they like their beer and so we never saw the Christian life looking no that was a thing I thought you just went to church and you meant till they believe there was a God so then you got a freak us to heaven if I was really like five but our our church had summer school where six weeks 16 but your summer you went for catechism classes so we had to memorize parts of the Bible which is good because that stuck with me as I got older and then Luther's catechism so if you've ever read that like questions and answers with Martin Luther and I'm sorry is good you know but um but it was never really a reality but I was always thankful that at least I had some Bible knowledge because of that [Music] my like as a family we prayed the other before I kind of is like a ritual I'm usually prayed together before we went to bed all good but my dad is an alcoholic and was that was a big problem growing up and so he had angry outbursts this was what I just thought was a while I mean the dark involved in your life debnath come home after work and I didn't know any different I never saw like a godly family anything like that my parents ended up divorcing when I was in eighth grade and at the time I felt like that was the biggest lesson I could have so but my dad was out of the house and then you know acted out of course dealing with anger towards him and then even a replica see hatred because of that my mom was so her and she would talk to us girls about growing up to be an independent woman never rely on me half of everything because you know the man had totally failed her and so I had that in my head that I was going to being independent and you know cohabitate before we got married to make sure that nothing like that would happen to me and things like that and I'd never saw that going against anything up the church talk because church didn't teach any kind of sanctification so let's kind of my family background well but even this file that my mom was only good mom and I think the kiss she was a really good relationship with us and would talk with us and listen it probably kept me out of trouble that I could have potentially gotten in but I was never I never want to like the parties or anything and I don't know if it was just my friends didn't want to invite me because I didn't think I would drink or if God just protected me but they never invited me like my best friends would never invite you to their weekend activities and there's a time I was so hurt and I was back and I'm just thankful because grade my girlfriends are drinking on the weekends and their past guy alcohol and if they would have invited me I would have gone along with it who knows when I could have got started down but God kept me from it and so I was always thankful for that and as I got older now but I was in sports growing up and long jumped and track and hang and there was this boy on the track team who was also pretty good atlanta and so one year it was my freshman year and his junior year and we were practicing for the state meet at another school because our school didn't have good facilities and so we talked a little bit later that summer this boy he calls me on the phone and I was pretty excited he was mr. all-star athlete and everybody in the county beautiful northwest ohio area knew who he was and so my sister and i were just so excited because jesse yet told me on the phone and [Music] we did start you know seen each other than shortly later but neither of us he was raised in church he'll share that to you that neither of us ever talked about faith or anything like that like I didn't I was never into the party scene but we still like we're not in our Christian relationship or anything like we were pre nothing like that it was just a typical high school dating relationship when he after that year was going to happen for school I'm devastated I was so sad and I thought well I'll probably be denied a bit but we cover this relationship going for after that and then it was during my junior year of high school and his and whatever a first year in school here Akron I was invited by some French to go to a Christian rock concert and I I went to a lot of regular concerts on weekends with friends and so I said well how much is you know how much of a tickets I'm like no it's free you just come and oh thats fun a free concert so I went with them and he was going to something that weekend I didn't know what it was but this and even though it was a Christian rock band was in a small little cafe area and Toledo was a Toledo based band that thing went big national after that but when i was there they were towards the end then they started playing these like worship songs and i had never experienced anything like that like oh you know i just knew that on lutheran style church services were little surgical and I saw friends that have like their hands up I've never seen anybody do that before and I was just struck by something that like something is real to them that's not real to me and I don't know what they have but I want that and so even just in that simple way like I do nothing oh I just knew like I have to change and so that was I always look back at that and you know we know about like Christian rock and spirits that can go on with that but I always think about how brother branham said that God can use a penny in a penny way and God used that particular band in my life to take you one step closer and so on Sunday night when you you know have to just on the phone and I saw it you have to break up with him because I don't know much but I know this isn't going to work and I know so it's really nervous and we're talking for a little bit and I said well I need to tell you something some kind of important I need to talk to you that feels like okay I need to tell you something too okay I don't remember who won first but cups too much he went to a conference call with a group called athletes in action which is a Christian athletic group for college athletes and he went to one and he gave his heart to reward that weekend and I went to a fishing rod concert I knew my heart toward that weekend in our own little ways and so we were both about to tell each other what just happened thinking that I was still working and so I always look back at that is that just made a huge impression on you like that was the opportunity i was ready to break it off with him but God has ordained it but that wouldn't happen so on our relationship started changing a lot then and as we kind of worked through like what it is to be a Christian and um it was the time for me to decide what I was going to do after graduation I headed out flown to a school for track and looked at some other places and me and my big ambitions I thought I wanted to go to an Ivy League school and how different think that uh up in and Jesse did not want me to go that far away and started me to want to either so he was some here in Akron and I decided that I would go to Kent State so I could be a little bit closer to him but not be the exact same school then so I went there and we started talking after I've been here about getting married young and what that would look like if we should be good swing it in college and started talking to so much his friends who did because by that time you've been dating for three years and so laughs he was very nervous about if I'm not going to marry this girl I ever got whatever help because he was so attached and I didn't I understand that but you know it was God needing him but I was really involved with Campus Crusade for Christ if you're familiar with that college ministry that first year at school and it was really really involved there that's like her all my friends were so we had gone back over thanksgiving to visit our family and while we were gone consume our family well in the same area and Jesse had come back to talk to me about something things like I gotta tighten up I just did this I will study was Simon and he starts rattling off stuff like there's no Trinity and women she only wear skirts dad sent a prophet and he said something lesser concede and he just threw it all out of me and I was like oh my goodness he's getting into a cult and I was terrified and I was like oh you just said there's a Trinity so I was really really nervous about that he was so excited and all I kept I would arise i was thinking through and he would tell me things he's really writing about it he kind of question things that you kind of go back and forth and i had my back to how we both given our hearts Lord the same weekend oh god why that happened because I was ready to break up with him then why would you allow that and then bring us to this point where he starts getting into some crazy doctrines and now I got to figure all this out and so it was really hard on me well because I say it so seriously like I didn't want to be deceived and I wanted to know the truth but I didn't understand how it could be so exciting to him and it was so scary to me so uh that Christmas break we went to go do some bible study with brother Craig door you know we had my hair and at that time he was just doing bible studies and little services in his house and I thought he was very nice you know but I went on the internet and I printed out some proof that this man was not perfect and I had a stack of papers to him and time this and he's going to be scared right on and so I came in and when we sat down for the Bible study so I gave it to him and I just remembered him two papers and he was like I feel sorry for the better and I thought she's not scared okay no I'm proving him wrong he's not scared and that really made an impression he wasn't intimidated by what i thought was proving wrong so we went through and he would kind of explain things and had gone to a couple I think maybe one of the services here at his house on a Saturday night that girl was okay but I just was not convinced when I had way too many questions so now whole next semester I told my mom just a little bit about what was going on but not a whole lot and she was very alarmed and they same thing thinking like as soon as we heard the word prophet we just not called because about the stuff you know that you see for people who proclaim themselves to be Proctor itself sir um so she was really nervous about it because she knew how much I love Jesse and so she was afraid you know that I was just going to go with whatever he says because I liked him so much without lil next semester I just spent a lot of time myself like reading the Bible I read through the different bible studies that he had we would sit down and go through things I'd ask questions and an at Kent State they have a really large library and they have a whole area of like historical Christian books so I just went to library and I was pulling out history books and I was reading about church history and I wanted to see if the things that I've better brand I've talked about like with the torch ages and with the Catholic Church and these things could I find that same information elsewhere and so I would get out like versions of foxes Book of Martyrs from 18 windings and I was just reading them and it's all about the capture the whole thing and reading other books and just shocked that this is not lining up with what they're talking about even things like that is I'm like it was all there these books and so God knows how to work with each of us power I wired and so that was very important to me and I'm that earlier before that I had agreed to go with campus crusade for what they call summer projects which is like a stateside mission mission to kind of for the summer and so they send these college kids two different vacation areas with the idea that if there's so many people are traveling to this particular vacation area we have the impact to witness to a great number of people in one setting because different people are constantly coming in and out and so the leadership at Kent had wanted us all to go to this particular project in ocean city in New Jersey because that's where they sent the people who were going to become leaders within the crusade organization so I was going there and Henry such tremendous amount of money to go and then it's justin sharing all these things with me I was really questioning that decision and like I've already resolved money and I can't give it back because I don't even know who key what so there was no way for me to get this money back and I started to get really nervous about this trip because as we added Bible studies the scripture that kept like I kept thinking about was what happens if he preached another gospel than what Paul preached and I knew that what Campus Crusade was sharing I wasn't so sure that was the truth anymore verified that i would point somebody in the wrong direction so you know Jesse and I kept having bible studies i can't remember if I spent much more time with further creative over the brooks but towards the end of that semester I just from reading the Bible in history I knew that being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was right and that things had been changed then I knew that but I didn't really like own it like I wanted to be baptized I just thought that's the right way but I didn't have it in me yet to want to do it and so as we would talk I eventually asked him you know just pray for me because I know it's right but I don't want to do able and I don't want to go do it just because I know it's right if I don't feel in my heart and so we prayed and whatever spirit was like holding me back it was it was gone next Stanley going to bed and in the morning I woke up it was clear and what I needed to do and on right before at school we were finishing up for the semester and the leader of the crusade group Garrett can't somebody take my college roommate when I told him kind of what was going on and so he he kind of met with me privately and it was asking about it and I knew so little of a message like I couldn't really explain it to him and what I did explain like looking back I wasn't exactly a riot I was just doing the dust based on what I knew but the one thing he said to me when like just talking about baptism because to me it was just like let me just figure this out first this is just a Bible thing when I can look at the Bible and see this and he said when you're talking about it he went home if Jesus says this and Peter says this I would certainly take the words of our water heater ah and I said no neither shaking my head if I just wanted a conversation hold on i'm just Lee didn't go talk to him because I already knew what he was going to tell me I want a god to tell me I didn't want anybody else would I didn't talk to a lot of people about it but that was Ida sighs that's as much understandings he has he's okay with the Bible contradicting itself and this is not somebody I can trust so that really solidified it for me there as far as him but after school then I did get baptized my mom came and my aunt who lived in the lineman area she came to and um I think she just wanted to be there because it was an important event but she didn't really support it so as soon as we started driving home simon and jess and then my mom and aunt you're driving back and my mom needed time yeah grilling and having questions or any way from the first one to ask but she was just I'm trying to understand why didn't you just say this Peter said this and you did it this way and Simon starts talking and my mom just one and I'm so frustrated because I I knew the life that was there and I love my my dear but I knew that she hadn't spent the time studying the Bible and the history on this like I had and so this was real to me and it frustrated me that people were dismissing it and they hadn't been so I just kind of you know let that go but I I had Reese all that money to go to New Jersey and I didn't want to go at that point I had no choice and I was just a nervous wreck about it but I went and I packed all skirts because I just didn't even want to wear other things but I still took along like modest savings because that I didn't have a full understanding wait more but so while i was there than you know Jesse and I were talked a lot and on our pay phones because I didn't have cell phones in so we'd be talking on a phone we didn't have email I don't think um and Heath I can't remember he mailed it to me or he sent it with to me a bunch of bible studies like printed off for me to just go through while i was there and i spent a lot of time by myself there were like 115 maybe other college kids we were all in this massive house through all kinds of fire codes we were just crammed in this place and on i spent as much time as i could by myself and I would just go by myself with my Bible if I told them what I'm thinking all and I felt so alone and I had to wrestle with that the whole summer and mom but God using such a tremendous way that I knew leaving that summer someone had asked me you know how it was for me this person had like on a bunch of these summer project trips and so this he just loved it this is what he did Hansen when I thought about it and I said it was the hardest summer of my life I would never want to go through this again i'm so glad i did it and he was didn't like and I just left it there i thought god knows what I need but it was the best thing for me because I was all by myself and I just read the Bible and I read through these bible studies and I live and I'm just crying out to God to give me direction because I'm even like coming off for this summer I needed to make a decision in I was either going to you know follow the message or I was going to stay in you know denominational Christianity water you know evangelicalism and go on with this particular organization and I'm either leaving it they would say I with her at a call they would say I wasn't false doctrine they would shun me they would potentially mock me and I would use all of my friends at school and on and that was hard to think about that already lost my old friends when I gave my heart solar the first time in high school and then I was going to lose them again and and I just didn't know what was right but through that summer I would I just started going down to the ocean by myself and I take my Bible and I just started reading through Psalms and I didn't know what I was reading forward and really have like an agenda I was just trying to read the Bible just her to get some direction and figure out what God wanted me to do and there was this one time i was there by myself and I got to solve 32 and I was just reading and all of a sudden I hip verse 8 and it was just like the words came off of age and stared at me is that I won't start being teach thee and the way which thou shalt go I will guide me with my eye and I read that now you've got it sent me there that's someone so that he could be he gonna start to eat I wasn't out of this well and just keep walking because he had it all under control so I feel like that verse is my life worse you know because it just no matter what happened I just named like I just had to keep following the Lord and he was he was start seeing my stuff's enough and I really feel like from that moment on like the Bible changed and it wasn't just a book anymore with God talking to me so I would you know read those those studies and things and everything I was seeing with these friends and an acquaintance since there that were being supposedly really living for the Lord I would just look at things and think like that's not even just like basic modesty things the way the girls would dress after one of the young men had the courage to get up and ask them not to dress that way I just yes that um but that one sounds last time I ever work here shorts that was last time like does he talk to me about why I bathing suit event which I know it just seems like it should be so obvious but I didn't see it and he explained it to me it was like oh okay I get that then so God just really used it to change everything for me and he sent me the first sermon I ever listen to forever their brand I'm consent to be there he's that my marriage and divorce you never listen to marriage and divorce it's pretty good sermon to listen to the first one and it was honestly really hard for me to hear and I felt angry and hurt when I was done because he was preaching so hard against the women which now i understand wasn't reaching a christian but it was so hard for me to listen to because in my upbringing the one who caused the most hurt in my life was my father and so it was hard for me to hear that in all i could think of was what about what about the men that mistreat their lives and what about the men that drink too much and are invested in their children and live and their families and all these different things so now that was hard but it is area off so i'm going to talk to him later about it that when he told my brother Brooks and rather Craig that he sent me marriage and divorce they were like you sent her white if I knew I had listened to anything else that was the first turn inside the portal view of you know for the Brandon's teachings but he sent it because we were talking about getting married if that was the right thing for us um I don't think I listen to another one for a long oh but I decided towards into that summer then I would I didn't know what I was going to do but I wouldn't be a part of campus curse anymore and ants was one of the leaders they were about that in them she was really sweet about it but it was hard going through the rest of the summer with him because they were all planning what the new here would be and I just kind of staff meeting for Jenna thing he thinks I was too scared to tell anybody else I'm ended up getting from home n and had a few couple weeks maybe back at my mom's before going back to school for the fall semester and I had no idea that there was just a ton of stuff that had been going on in our hometown while I was away for the summer and so I got back and you know I had a skirt on and i was real tired from the flight so i was sleeping and my mom came and woke me up and she's likely need to talk I just had I said oh so girly she's like yes now so I sit up and she just laid into me about what I was getting myself into you and this being occult and you can't do this and tell me about all these things that happened this summer with other friends who had been baptized and recruiting school and here she had gone on the internet and looked up Bible believers com I think or something that is not affiliated with a message but because the the church that whether Isaiah was pastoring alignment is called Bible believers she thought that was the name of some denomination so she searched or she got on this website and she's reading all these things that really scared her and some of it was on like submission for women and because of her experience was very alarming and they took it to a certain extreme there was a lot gotta balance and so she was really worried she said that she thought that he was going to make me quit school get married and just not having as many babies as I could like that's what she gathered from this website and because I also refer experience it was really important to her than I graduated college because as a single mom she really struggled to support our family with our college degree so I had a full ride to school plus extra she didn't want to see me throw that away and she got Jesse was going to make me do that and so I was trying to talk her down from this like I'm still in school they pay me to go to school and acquitted it's a good job and she didn't believe me my aunt came in and started questioning me and my aunt said something about you know you just have to watch with groups like this because they'll take one Bible verse and take it out of context and that made me so frustrated because I felt like baptism thingy you know that that's the Trinitarian formula takes one scripture out of context and built a whole doctrine around it so much is frustrated me and I didn't like knowing that everybody thought I was doing this for Jesse and I knew I was didn't forgot but that was just something i just had to shrug my shoulders and deal with and know that people were going to say this about me there's nothing I could say to through the law my Christian friends from high school when they found out about it like they would talk to me to look at me they were very very rude they said really bad things about me others mocked me behind my back but I had one friend from high school that always stuck is so a really special friend and she doesn't really understand the message but whenever they were talk about him if she would stick up for me I was clean earthly appreciate those like that but the whole town was just panicked about a group of us coming to the message and Jessie might share more about it they've called like a council hug and different church leaders and their wives and bringing in those of us Simon was there Jessie sister Bessie some other people were all there and they were just going to question and my mom told me I needed to come back from school to go to this cuz she's thinking out they were talking out of it i just told her no and I stopped going home to visit my family I just got to be way too much but I knew what I saw in the lives of the believers and I knew what I saw my lines with everybody else and you know and I was away for the summer I thought if those people are you go the best actors in the world or they have something that other Christians still because that life is different so they couldn't you know they kind of talking out of it we've then got married the next summer and even there at our wedding like people were upset there was somebody sitting in the front row of our wedding who was this man slouched down in a seat he had his arms folded and he was like this whole way through our wedding ceremony site is that will they will yeah they were mad at you i could see different people we need from growing up that are whispering back and forth but i knew it was right and I knew they didn't understand and I wasn't upset but just shows your shoulders a new on so so by then we were going to church there in Lima and married and still dealt with my issues for my my mom and different people for maybe another a few years like when we would go back and visit you know comments would be made and that was always hard but you know how it is like I think most of us understand how that is a feeling i'll also just try to love them and pray form i'd always offer like could we do a bible study just so i can show you now i'm not trying to convince you i just want to show you that there are Bible verses that I believe support this and everybody would just say no and so that was hard but then when Lydia and I was finishing up College right then so I found I was graduating early I had her graduated two weeks later um but it was such a big change to go from I was like full-time you know student was student teaching and I was doing an honors thesis and so just had a lot going on and then to go from that to just caring for this baby my mom wasn't there to help because she just changed jobs and didn't have any vacation time and I didn't realize it at the time and I think I have postpartum depression and it was really hard I just cried every single day I was all by myself I was so overwhelmed I didn't know what to do with a baby I babysat children I didn't know what to do with my home she cried a lot and I just felt so alone Anna what really scared me was I had a really bad dream and I woke up and I was afraid that I'd hurt her and let's sleep and I knew like this more than me and so I went up for prayer then the next day because it was a Sunday and um I just confessed like I'm really having a hard time and Robertson big for me and it so I've been like two weeks with that and it was just gone on the next day like all the anxiety and the depression and everything like it lets it i was still overwhelmed but i wasn't like depressed anymore and an anxious like that another testimony from that was i had a real hard time adjusting to not having time to like read my Bible and pray whenever I wanted so when the brothers would preach about you know Christians not reading their Bibles to not praying I feel so condemned because I thought it was just I was such a failure now and I was so ghastly because i had ATM and so I gone up for a prayer to ask the brother like to help me that I could somehow time to read my Bible and pray baby and she cried every time I tried to do that and so I was expecting that he was going to say on right systematically a prayer here that that will help you we July when prey like you should and instead he backed up and crispy come and go up remember to call six exit devil I was I want and he just totally flipped it on its head and it really relieved me of the guilt I was having he was saying God has called you to care for go to speak and he was just telling you like the way you serve your family you're serving God read your Bible but if I go maybe you can only get a couple verses in at a time because can't sit down like you used to and you just really like counseled me do that within just a couple minutes and it was something I just always remembered because I was it just lends me so much and i felt like a family cares about money even just as a mom you know caring for my children at home and that it's I'm not a worse Christian now because of that and you know now six goodness even you know greater than that that's what that was that was something that had always really want something and then I'll just see me sheriff or after we had Malachi right before we have Malachi we but led to start the church and on have been traveling to Lima I think for a year and a half and we were sometimes the first one there we were driving three hours and usually the first ones there I don't think you're over the last one to leave but we never left early my brother Jess had to shake hands with everybody before we left but though your eyes there with everyone and it was really good that towards the end is just really getting hard doing this with a baby Lydia did not travel while she screamed but full three hours there and three hours back she didn't sleep and recover see so it was really wearing on us than we were expecting again and we were been working with brother Brooks on potentially starting a church here and I just knew jessie was the pastor I just went and I think anybody else know but I knew it and I just kept quiet about it at the time we thought where the tim myers would be his evangelists now but he was up in the area and when Tim was getting married he was human too much Carolina and I just smiled in my heart and Jesse's the pastor he's called me pastor but I never thought of what that would be for me like that that makes it past fine and so I just knew it that's his call me and I'm an acute mental you know hate towards may be reluctant to to think that and but we eventually did starting you know are here now we got Malachi then as a baby and he was sick a lot Jesse what is now pastoring he was working and he was in graduate school and there were different financial issues too and I was finding myself like a tea kettle almost every night when it was really hard for me to keep my temper under control and I just felt like I was so stressed out all the time and come to the end of the night he gave him a the two little ones of a half now I kinda had this cried at a local bar and it just it echoed in the bathroom in such a way that I just felt like it was like giving me a short circuit and I would get so upset i would just eventually screams I'm so really we just frustrated and how was tension and I didn't even understand what it was and then I would just cry because I felt like the worst mother in the world and if I find scarring my children like I was really really worried that they were going to have I don't know like stress issues growing up or anxiety issues because I only this tea kettle sometimes in order just cry felt so guilty and then I would talk to Jesse about it no time like I don't want to do this and I'm praying when I can feel a building and I know he's like Oh God says you know that he'll give us a shout and I believed it but I didn't see it and I was trying to find like an immediate way out in that moment when I was so frustrated like I'm doing with a Christian being with and praying and i'm quoting scripture and i'm trying to sing it's not working and it was really hard for me and what ended up spinning was God evening the way up and in a way I didn't expect where another man that is a pastor of a large church in the area I was friends with Jesse and with asking him if if he was taking our date for more he was like nah no we just family stuff sometimes we'd be that now instead and his like really need to take your life on the dates you need we need to have a break on the kids and uh huh and he gives them a book couple of just a couple chapters out of I thinking what made copies or something just started reading Wow yeah yeah so he started taking me out of the house and it wasn't until years later that I realized I was praying for the way out marketa too I didn't know that what I needed was just time out the house and time away from the children as much as I love him mom you know how it is like day in day out with him he is so busy it was just more than my stress levels I could manage as one person and so you know God did into my prayer and and I really create our one service you know just a nice team crying to think I don't scream on the kids like this and here i prayed afterwards for like 45 minutes or an hour it got really delivered me there too and so our first date that we have you know Jesse wanted to try to bring this up and talk to me about it and I could tell him like why delivered me and and so that was a real blessing to word of you know I was just thankful that in those situations God showed that he was mine and and build that I'm able to bear so now that was a special thing and now just being a mom so many children just see that is like the most sanctifying experience ever people say like I can never have so many children as you i'm not patient enough and like i'm not patient enough either oh my goodness that guy no I blew up at making so much when I just had a couple of it it's through the experience of being a mom to so many other gods made inclusion and it's like temporary me down and help me and more nurturing and has helped me grow and all those you know treats that we're supposed to have as a Christian like if anything fun it's been it's been motherhood and second to that probably ministry but I'm thankful for those now so it makes I think my Christian walk a little bit different than other people who are being passed that stage or who aren't there yet but God definitely misses so Spencer and now one last thing I'll in with I'd set up not having a good relationship with my dad ever God delivered me from hating him or I can say I talked to him on for my teeth I love you dad and I mean it a pity him where he is right now sorry for him and that you know a preformed got can deliver him but I always had a hard time thinking with God as a heavenly father but the scriptures where it says like if your earthly fathers know how to give you a good gifts I'm surely God does my hundred so I could never connect with scriptures about father I just I don't I told my mom wants because she feels bad about it so we don't miss it because I never had I don't even look like it's okay but now because of having the family that we do about God's grace and just see also breaking the cycle of dysfunctional family in his life to see him as a father now and the kind of man that he is has really redeemed what it is to help out is that Heavenly Father for me so now I can look at him at how he interacts with our own children and I only like that that's what it is you know and how he interacts with me dan look how God loves his bride it's I'm thankful for them so even if I did have like a great example and my home growing up have it now [Applause] why don't we stand and sing a song here to let you stretch your legs a little bit i'll try to go I try to just decrease I don't go fast i'll try to increase anything it's a lot of your my testimony when i drink anyway so i'll try to keep it brief or by God's grace and I will bless the lord o my soul and all that is where take fastest fall and I will [Music] [Applause] or just done great things for [Music] great for d 0 [Applause] [Applause] by God's grace I'm gonna switch over here at okay so i'm mostly you haven't heard a lot of my testimony she's got a creature i'm able to share a lot of that by God's grace I just I have no I just have a few pictures i thought i would repaired he's back in May when I went to buy the cam sure to preach I gave my testimony there I'm a little bit by God's grace so please God I just have a few slides here like to show by the grace of Lord so 1980 I came on the scene up starting to go back here yeah nineteen eighty I came on the scene my dad's name is snooki Smith I never believed that that name was really haunted in those whole life and he's been teased and it is coffee because you know he's used it as a crutch bless his heart he's never able to overcome that he's trying to change his name a few times and he finally has changed it to rain now just as his middle name ray smith is just Ray Smith so I haven't seen a middle name is he stuck erased method I'm jessierae but that's always kind of a you know been a stigma for him a struggling point there I've always loved my dad I was never very proud of my dad he's just been wonderful dad when he's been there and i was i was born and my mom already had three babies and diapers I was the poor child and she had Simon who's three years three years older than me and then my brother Sam and cam were twins they were one year older than me and then I was born she had four babies diapers at the same time and my mom said I was the most content baby ever she would nurse me set me down and then the two twins would take all the rest of the nursing them exciting as much nursing as they got but I never complained about it so I had odd you know to me it's kind of odd thing they were hoping for a girl the whole time Oh God sets good girl you know kid three boys is all right that's another boy so I just ordained of God which is very happy I had a very happy childhood you know that I grown up I just loved just love playing with my dad I love baseball and those bright my body could sports and I never want to be a preacher and everyone to I I was my mom my mother took us to church every Sunday every Sunday everyone tonight all by herself my dad would go he was raised Catholic but live in search for God till nineteen eighty-three so I just member going to church every Sunday and cried my mom dragon six kids to church you know growing up he was really God's grace but she taught us always be in the house of God and she's got three preachers out of it by God's grace and 50 60 or 50 to message her to what a moment goes and hostile to church so I really believe God's honored her faith in that way but I grew up in a Trinitarian Assemblies of God Church and there was no holiness standards you know although the pastor's my boys wear skirts every week oilers skirts but we were speaking in tongues almost every sin every of sunday morning and it was almost the same people a few different people it was nothing and usually it was just general stuff a couple times it was like really specific and call people out and then I told you this one time when I was a teenager I was just playing God I want to serve you show me you rely said send seven tons interpretation without believe you and I'll serve you now the Bible said at two at most three but that service got and there was like 10 I mean it's just kept coming each one I was like oh oh and then I felt bad because I still want to surrender to God I was feeling so all about soldiering tonight you know sins as a teenager things like that but I knew God was real in 1988 of course you know my mother was here to cancer that's been the most profound being miracle that's happened to me just around me to see that to visit my mom in the hospital and crying leaving knowing she's gonna die and my dad prays over her one night while she's sleeping and they hope they cut her open for surgery to take outs of the cancer and tall God and then the next year or two we went around in different churches in Toledo are on the area my mom would give her testimony and just knowing the power of God I've always known that God is real there's power always had a reverence for God there's a little picture of us growing up with my dad there's me there's am in Simon Khaya but that's a little picture of us we love to play you know with my dad real good dad nobody was a balance of depression yeah but really enjoyed that this would make sure we brought the year before my mom had cancer that's not my mom that's my hand but that's me my sister Betsy it's my cousin Simon and then Santa cam hands the background they're real humble in the background but I got pretty dark as a job that inspired my testimony to you know they always made fun of me cuz I'm so dark I got into darker than that I like how dark my legs I was really really dark and so they would make fun of me they would call me some slang words for an African American you know how he's going and cry and so my dad would captain on the shoulder so that's okay so you're my only black said he said it to you call me so even in my types of hurt you would try to encourage me he was always encouraging like go to college get an education you know said you know you're going to do something great you know just just go to college or do something great and he was always encouraging me that he was only doing when I was begging to go to the baseball card Authority taking the baseball card store and I was always thankful you know for my childhood my mom was such a servant she's known in our town as the time saying you know every Christmas Easter and Thanksgiving she does think the kids meals she'll give out 200 meals to the shut-ins and and the town just gathers in you know and and supports and just gives donation to turkeys and everything like that so I'm very thankful you know for the faith my mom instilled in with me and my mom would gather us all run every night my dad was never there maybe just a couple of times but every night she got all six kids and make everyone pray first and she would closing prayer sometimes we roll around the bed rolling off the bed snicker and you know yeah boys are here but she always taught us to pray every morning before school we join hands with you no matter or later not we join hands a word of prayer and pray that God will bless the day and my mom really instilled that we need to pray I've never forgot thats always been a great rock you know me growing up around nineteen eighty nine or nine I was saved from drowning I was drowning and my cousin Matt who is the brother of the cousin Adam that was your last Sunday he jumped in and pulled me up and I remember going down like I was I was all just saying it's old it's all up it's all over and he pulled me up and that gave me a new lease on life and it was just really great you know to see how god I'm trying to be a big boys come across the big pond you know I was already up for it was awesome to see how God came and save me from that there's a few other times one time in college I was running with a gentleman to football practice and he's got this little geo metro or somebody's like let's take it up to 100 a sick up the night I'm like dude slow down dude you know this is before I heard the message but he was speeding on 76 getting off right there right right near that goodie gear headquarters and there was all kinds of traffic all kinds of traffic and he tried to try to get off at the exit and slammed on his brakes and we went spinning two or three times across four lanes and we stopped God is my witness we stopped right by that the middle concrete barriers and we had room to get out and then as soon as we stopped four or five trucks drove past you know 70 miles per hour and we just looked at each other like we were just spared God just spared our lives oh now they came in i'm sorry yeah so God just spared my life that way so numerous times and one time I was choking on the Sun silly but on the egg yolk a hard-boiled egg I was choking on that and I couldn't breathe and I would get ready get ready to pass out my dad comes up and gives me the hymen maneuver a shout out some of the yolks I know at least three or four times God has saved my life least from passing out or something like that and I'm very thankful for God's and the mercy I voicing his hand of mercy in my life that might be the theme of my testimony God's mercy his favor you know I think favor was what I like the most see my fur gotta just show me a favor um but in 1992 I think my dad taught me the greatest lesson I was about 12 years old I put this on facebook about two years ago but i just love baseball he was my idol Jose Canseco don't remember him but he was a sports car driving fanatic you know it went in fanatic and I just love me because he had big muscles get a lot of home runs well I studied his cars I knew every fact about him RBI's hum of this is batting for batting average home runs everything like that and my dad was really starting to seek out at that time and he pulled that card he said Jess he said he set it down he said you know Jesse Jose Canseco doesn't like blonde women he doesn't he likes trucks that likes pick ups trucks and he hit 20 home runs in 1988 I said no dead he's got a blonde girlfriend he drives a red sports car and he had 42 home runs in 1980 he said Jesse you know I couldn't deceive you on that about Jose Canseco I couldn't i deceive you on that and he said and I said well because I know am i studying him and he said that's the same way it is with jesus christ he said you get to know Jesus Christ so much you said you if you know him so well know the word so well no man will deceive you I was just a little tall girl but ok dad you know that's kind of weird no walk away but that never left me as soon as I gave my heart to Lourdes came back to my mind and that's the others picture my dad did by God's grace but that was the greatest lesson I've ever learned in my life no Jesus Christ so well at the devil can to see in other words have revelations right for the puts for the message terms as so much made the revelation that second can't to see because they lack could not be to see David that's been a great testimony in my life there is my dad I've been a great instrument there to help me 1977 I god help me punch my ticket to akron i'm just going to show a video real quick i should think i showed us at the other place in 1997 we were state champions in football division five here in Ohio and here's here's just a little bit here let me go back a little bit okay so where this little we're this little tiny town we're like a just a super tiny town this is what I use for the kids i was teaching the kids and bible study how you can have a natural tail in spiritual town so this is right right down the road on 77 and it's over at fawcett stadium the state championship there and how do we not made it i don't think i ever want to come to a cur I didn't know the city named Akron existed actually um so this is I was required receiver so that's the state championship game I caught a few passes here that's me number 11 I was led an hour and I got a touchdown that state championship game well there was a bunch of scouts up in the stadium I hear i kneeled down i'm not even a Christian but my mom just praising me all the time and I was so humble that I caught a touchdown I just kneel down and thank God I wasn't even I mean I was cussing and smoking you know all kinds of stuff but they were just all the prayers of my mother I was telling the kids got and taught me at least to honor God with my talents this is just right down the road here idea but their scouts up there from Akron and pretty soon as my brother saying he's a real he's excited God thank God one day he's gonna come this message he told me reach out there it is his why even have told me you know that they believed everything I said the different thing but I'm very thankful for that so I was showing the kids you know how at a natural Tampa then God give me a spiritual town and this was in Columbus in 2010 I prayed for that sister there and she got him about four things in that specific service there for Easter she could have been her knee she had back trouble all kinds of the things that after service she's so happy like saying you know God healed me of all these things and I just said praise the Lord you know I was fasting that whole weekend you know and I told God I'm not going to take any offering if you do some supernatural take no offering God didn't numerous supernatural things that weekend so just showing the children you know how uh uh if you have a natural gift that's wonderful but the spiritual gifts are more important to that I'm gonna switch over so that was my ticket to accurate was because I you know I was playing right down the road here and never knackered existed if you coaches saw me and they offered money they told my coach to offer him a scholarship and so I didn't have any other offers so I want to play football attacker and was very thankful for that I showed the video but 1998 I bet the level love my life my wife you know or jumping long jumper there's our first picture of a Thanksgiving together by God's grace you know and my life has never been the same said she had a different character than all the I used to do I stood you know right girls a lot of notes I was a talk on the phone kind of guy you know that's all we did we never really did nothing do more with that we never went on dates or anything like that it sounds like okay dating you know what i mean but i usually don't know from girlfriend a girlfriend you'll just talk on the phone girlfriend that's all we had that's all we did there and uh oh then when I met Chris it was totally different i could never break up with her other girls i could break up with but it's going to break up with her so I just knew there was something different about her um and then she said you know in 1999 I went to college and I remember the first this first semester I was so it was the most awful depressing semester of my life because I was not serving God I was all alone I wasn't with her I drive back every weekend to see her so I was I heard my fractured my fifth lumbar vertebrae in high school had never got detected and I went to Akron to play football and they put me in a back brace for four months i couldn't even run for four months it was most impressing I remember just driving down chapel hill mall just trying to waste time is driving all by myself just so so miserable and then but these guys from the chapel up here in agric have witnesses to be like I'll he should come and said and finally I gave in and and part of it was my brother cam so I put the picture brother Caleb here when I would go home and see my wife Kim he just gave his heart to the Lord of denomination he was you know he was in there the church that we grew up in and he was like me borrow his car and so I 10 drivers caught there he had Christian contemporary music and a shower like its of the songs priest happy songs and singing about heaven and all these things like that and then through that I went to an athletes in action conference on the same night Kristin went to the day concert and I saw a six foot six his name was tim anderson he's a redhead he played for hiyo state use a national champion in 2002 I always I'll never forget it and he knew me too we played against each other in college too he started raising his hands to God and I felt so ashamed of myself of all the times I tried to give my heart to God of all the gifts got to give me how a state champ about seven times you know tracked in football different things like that of all the things God has blessed you with and here I'm ashamed to raise my hands and I've been running from God all these years I said God forgive me and I just not right there gave my heart to Lord as soon as i got home i threw away my metallica like Nirvana my Snoop Dogg notorious b.i.g I took out the pictures off the wall I went out or no I had a NIV Bible my church gave me I started studying that NIV bible and i came to matthew 7 and said you know the Bible said not everyone is saved that me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of God only those who do the will my father's haven't you cast out demons and all these things and I just I never knew what that meant and so for two years I struggle with that what does that mean I don't understand it I would go to church but I was always hungry for more the word like the church I was in was Presbyterian which is kind of I mean there's some good things in there like salvation but then I start hungry so I got in contact with john piper's ministry which brother case into Mars that's the John hi brewski is pastor that's it he was saying so he had a real eyelid connections college football and John Piper John pine burr had a doctrine called Christian hedonism and I loved it even a person who's hedonistic does what is whatever their pleasure right if you're eating istic whatever this pleasure while you do it well he had a little doctrine called Christian hedonism so a Christian only does what pleasures them and which is God so it's a little interesting you know I just loved it I ate it up I was hungry for more and more the word of God and kept he knows always want more of God and loving the Lord I mean I'd live with this burden for 19 years these times i tried to give my life to god i finally surrendered and I was just so happy and so thankful for god's grace in 2001 that's when the message came to me on Thanksgiving night it came to mean I look just like this on that night I was at I'll hair longer than that but I was after trim I think but it was on Thanksgiving night and Simon was the one who witness to me he let me listen to a sermon called two seats like Chris ha whoo-hoo since doesn't preach anymore but he was truly gifted man and I was just blown away and my wife was right sometimes I'd be on fire sometimes I doubt it sometimes I me a bar sometimes I doubted but took the course over in a few months there to God really solidified it in my heart and every time I was struggling like one time I was struggling and all the all the all my friends came in and prayed with me two gathers called and the very next morning Craig called me said how you doing bro Jesse he's completing the message I was like yeah oh yeah now i repented of that prayer but god no I needed that I needed that the morning after I remember getting up the first thing I was a call from Craig I thank you when he was here preacher horse and you I said thank you mother for calling me i need that call I just basically prayed and so I leave the message but I knew was wrong even in that and that brought such a conviction to my heart yes sir I still AM you know I still have my god too very so forgive me and so I was able to stay in the word of god there's a Simon you know with the kids if you think that about two years going Simon is a man of little statue but the man except the biggest heart I know he's just such a wonderful man of God anyway so we preach enforce all ends things I kind of need a break I got a busy bee coming up so that was 2001 and next 2002 is like the hour of five with that yours like our bible training firm I would just have a dr uncertain maybe once a month I drive over to Craig's and you bioassays for two or three or four hours as long as I could sit there I wrote down every scripture he ever said about anything I was just falling in love with the word of God so many great revelations a lot of friends left me and sober like that but always be grateful to god for the the bible training that i got to brother craig there and some some some assignment as well by god's grace 2003 was really my hour of deliverance i got a lot of delivering their liver ins from things like addictions and I hated my dad you know before this I hated my dad because left my mom and left us all there he didn't come a lot of my sporting events yet my sometimes my uncle's would I said a lot of hatred I just walk around hate of you know him who cares if he he moved to Tennessee I say who cares if he comes back you know but through the message you know through the preaching of were like oh you'd have to forgive everybody like if you don't forget you're not getting into heaven and I so realize I'm thinking about his name you know studying how his dad never talked to him they would go down for summers he was the last of 10 kids they would go down for summers down there to Florida you know like snow birds and sift my dad in the in the room and let him watch TV all winter long and would talk to it all that's just how he was treated come out to eat and sent back his room and so he was all alone he's used to know how do you know tree kids it did just didn't know how to overcome you know it all what kinds of struggles like that so I learned that pity on any compassion upon it and then God got rid of my numerous addictions like video games smoking and custody bad movies and all kinds of things like that a lot of awful addictions but in that year you know through studying the Bible that's why I told these brothers younger brother's coming in I said once you're free once you get into god fill your life with the word of God everything will fall off that sanctification is fill your life with the word of God every spare moment I find out even though I believe I'm born again I find I still need to give every moment of my time to God to make sure I don't go back to certain things right to temptations got the key that out we've got to keep filling your life with the word of God you to keep busy with the word of God in some type of ministry for 2003 I married the love of my life there i got married in that church i got baptized in my church I got ordained to preach in that church and bible believers Liddy was dedicating that church I love that church by believers in Lima I just love that church and brother Brooks preach a wonderful sermon that day all my family got to hear part of the message it was such a wonderful beautiful day the next day is when I believe I got the holy ghost cop sitting there in service we were there late and I just was just stood up all by myself which shouting rejoicing crying and seeing Christ you know my mind crucified and I walked out of there I just I just loved everybody I I've had not felt a lot I never felt a lot like that before I felt so free and the Holy Spirit's one that was the most free time I felt I'd had in the Holy Spirit and like so clean that too to this day as that was a day I put the stake down I believe that's where I got born again look at my life and I'm leave that lines up with the word of God so in 2004 i was ordained to preach the gospel there's a picture when i got ordained I brother Brooks and brother Craig was there brother tim was there different ones like that that was a special moment for me because I prayed and fasted a couple times that God showed me pop songs to provision first few times I preached there the author was filled with people just repenting and getting delivered I afraid if he fastens I've got to show me something supernatural and before I preach the other sister Karen right there she'd come up and or before I'd even preached on both sermons she even a word of knowledge and it's on tape I still got it today and we basically for tell when I was going to preach on so it's really a supernatural thing I really needed that my life by God's grace so I was attending you know then we made a Bible believers are Church of course and I was a deacon they're not just a minister you know like I said we drive three hours and i loved it i just love it there was Quinn churches around here but I just there's some other Brooks and those sayings brother Craig I just love those guys there there at the beginning you know they were the Shepherd's you watch over me and I'm so glad I did I learned so much about the Lord and serving God through those Saints such wonderful love and a real family atmosphere they helped create the Air Force 2004 Lydia came on the scene and had to become a father there by God's grace and Lydia you're the torture have all thought of something you know taught me a lot about serving others and when they say you don't children teach you to be less selfish that's so true and so true I've learned to live for them you know help them out the most I can by God's grace but that was a life-changing experience and each one that comes is another blessing from God 2006 I felt led to pasture and the scripture was on first Timothy 4 12 I've been praying and Jesus Jesus talked about counting the cost before you do anything right so I talked to numerous pastors you know should be what would it be like if we started church and Oh should we or the struggles were the trials we prayed about it a lot and then one day I was just hoping in the bathroom I think Lydia was taking a bath and I'll kind of something I don't know I just sitting there in the bath I just said lord I really need you to speak to me to show me if we're supposed to preach or have it have a church here i just opened up my Bible and it was first Timothy 4 12 let no man despise that youth be thou an example the believers in Word and conversational charity and spear and faith and purity till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine they blend out the gift that is indie which was given me by the prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery so that scripture and it was only one of my eyes went directly that when i was only one highlight on that page and i just had such a piece right there like ha I think God's calling leave God's calling me and I found out later how brother branham did that sister me too did that that's given me a lot more confidence you know throughout the years to know that I prayed and asked for it of all the place in the Bible I could open up to it was that one about being young and being example and preach the word so I really been thankful for that scripture uh you know as I was pastoring from 2008 2013 I made four trips to South America these trips revolution revolution eyes on her life I I hadn't seen much supernatural before this a guide seen demons cast out of bible believers I'd seen that one night but as far as myself I hadn't really seen such supernatural there's a picture we have brother Maxwell these picture hanging up he's a real apostle past her and bird Brooke so I believe he started some churches to my god is very so we've always believed he was an apostle and that was a thousand 2013 there by God's grace but preaching another country taught me a lot about the ministry but Rams to everybody if you can't make a trip and overseas that will change your life and it really has it really has just seeing how God works and moves amongst people I've seen numerous miracles air I seen a man who had arthritis it couldn't even walk we're well I kiewit just stumbled like yours kind of chic back and bored like that we prayed for him and within a matter of minutes he's jumping around like this and he's moving his legs and he's praising god I said you got there and testify buddy yohji hours ride is so bad he was instantly delivered of arthritis the woman that he had the kidney stone instantly healed there after prayer worship cows on five times there it was really striking and the holy ish on the hoist forgot such a piece I literally felt peace come down from heaven and seeing people delivered and demons cast out was such a powerful thing I never seen that no I never done myself I was always scared to do it but those experiences show me the reality of God's Word and the power if you just believe it and literally live in the right channel you know god will manifest through you so I was very very thankful for those trips and they taught me so much about the gospel so I think I'll just close it this one here in 2014 I was really struggling with guide your loan and evangelism or do I stay in pasture and I told the story numerous times by said Lauren and Juno 2004 test the lord help me to win some message that will support our church I really need that I gotta have somebody our church to know that you still want me here I need someone here and then that was when brother amen came on the scene there and such a supernatural day that was for me all around but just to see brother amen come in and receive the word and now to see him taking his position knows unneeded things like that it's been a tremendous work to me uh because I'm the kind I've learned I got to show me a sign I pray God show me give me a physical sign give me something I can I can really believe and you're seeing a soul come in is the most blessed thing you could ever see because its eternal life amen and so that is meant so much to me it's gonna be such a piece and I so enjoyed pastoring ever since then before I joined it for the first while but I got to a bad state you know where I was struggling how come I doubt see more and then through this through his testimony in through this prayer goddess really give me a lot of peace I just got to watch out because every time I say that my wife reminded me this every time I said this is the happiest I've been as a pastor sums comes to battle us like somebody aleve or somebody will get you know so I watch my word but it really has given me a piece because like program have said you know where you're standing once you have what you're in the perfect will of God so I've known that and I don't struggle that anymore I know God's calling me to Akron he brought us here I never to come here and what that's been for football then he saved me an Akron yeah I mean a preaching Akron save souls and akram each day numerous holes here in Akron prom to the messages the hour and so it's give me such a confidence to go on with the Lord and like I said I've been healed twice instantly and services one time brother samson shetty from india prayed for me I sore throat for 90s and think I've counted and I went up for prayer and I just forgot about it as I was walking out that door wanna live I've started singing and there was absolutely no pain in my throat I've never ever had that happen before I was instantly healed after he prayed for me that was tremendous I I really needed that and then the other time I was preaching and I felt something like a roof about my neck and I couldn't move my neck there was just a few years ago and I just Holy Spirit just took my hand and we closed service and I'm afraid for myself and I felt I just felt like it the evaporation of the Holy Spirit I just evaporating that pain and to just just fab rate up and I was just so grateful after that to see God's hand in my life but as I close you know that's that's just the highlights of my testimony as i can say i just feel like God has had his favor and mercy upon me my whole life and I just always want to reverence that I always want to be thankful for that like I haven't already go go through a lot a really hard you know I tragedies or things like that having had to really go through a lot of those now to just have favored you know in mercy and but I've gone through personal battles you know personal trials and those type of things but I never want to take that for granted i want to just continue to walk humbly i like the bots like the Bible said I want to do the will of the Father I want to do God's will my life I always want to point people to Christ and their live a real example before Jesus so let's stand our feet there undisclosed with that by God's berries and like I said you hear most mind testimonies all the time but I just know a men set out brother Jesse I want to be there when you give your testimonies out make sure he was here but if you have any question over my wife and iron thing was this room you could talk to them more about that but I'm just so thankful

lot of hope and a lot of excitement about the future on 35 you know so uh and you know I don't know how long God's going to carry but i feel like i got a lot of energy left i got a lot of the years
