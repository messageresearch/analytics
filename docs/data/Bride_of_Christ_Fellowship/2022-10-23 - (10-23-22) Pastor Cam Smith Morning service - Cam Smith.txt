========================================

God bless Saints amen I'll take that as a confirmation on where we're going this morning thank you brother and we pray that the Holy Ghost would be on our brothers he as he brings the church in worship the Holy Ghost is on you as well as Believers amen God bless each and every one of your precious uh saints of God there and hope it's okay but it sounds like uh you know I'm I'm here because uh you know brother brother William had it on his heart he's like man I'd like to hear Brother cam again so you know I I told some of the Saints yesterday I had a little fellowship and I said you know you really can't pay a a preacher any better of a compliment than that amen that they're able to get yielded to the Lord so with that brother we love you and we appreciate that and uh there's only one surprise I I'm not really excited about and that's uh that really Jesse and his family ain't here but uh you know we we have some real like-minded brothers and sisters in Christ here and we I don't know about you it won't be long we see we see it so close now that we'll be gathered not just in Heavenly places as we come to this Rapture but we will be gathered to that Heavenly Place amen and that's what we're looking for um and uh if there's anything I could say or do that would benefit you this morning it would it would just have to be something of the Lord in order to excuse me here I'm gonna do a PowerPoint this morning if we can get prepped up for that um but uh to just encourage you and show you how much God loves you and show you how much you love God Amen I think sometimes we're not fully conscious uh or maybe it becomes a little challenge uh how the devil would fight us and our lifestyles and our days and and he he wants you to feel like you have to fit some cookie cutter thing where you're this Mister or Miss Perfect Mrs perfect and and you know the love of God goes so far beyond that amen you know God loves us with a love that uh literally it cannot be it cannot be grasped by the human mind amen and uh that is a beautiful thing because uh that really takes you out of the picture amen now you can see what God has really done is he's what brought us to the place to see election and predestination amen and uh although you don't feel like you're what you're supposed to be God himself cannot see you any different than what he's seen you when he placed your name on that book amen when your name was placed on that book God forever settled it in his mind and in his sight what you would be for him amen oh my God hallelujah oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound amen amen let's get hooked up let's get right into the word of God this morning why don't we and uh we're just going to bring a little thought to you we know the Lord will help we know he's here and uh there's so many different directions that we could go but yet this is what's on our heart this morning from the Lord and this gets me stirred up when I when I when I preach uh certain things I just get so stirred up in the Lord because uh you know this Bible is is not just the revelation of Jesus Christ it is but it's also the revelation of what you are to him because remember as brother Branham said that each one of you are holding a part of God so how could Christ ever deny you when you're part of him oh my we Rejoice uh here it is uh we could call it the first commandment uh we could call it something that we just so earnestly live by uh you know putting God first in our hearts and lives amen Deuteronomy 6 4 it says here it says uh hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord amen he's one he's not three persons he's he has one A one-person God and Jesus Christ is what the fullness of the godhead bodily amen it's what you see amen and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart how much of your heart does he want all of it amen and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sit us in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when I thou lie us down and when thou Rises up now that right there is God's will to his church that's something though isn't it so as Christians we have a responsibility that we teach the word diligently to our children but notice it says and we shall talk of it when we're in this in the when uh when we sit us in the house when you're walking by the way when thou lie is down when thou rise is up God really desires us to be constantly fixed on him that is the love of Jesus Christ amen I've kind of been taken to church at home over maybe a little bit of uh a little bit of a push and trying to show them that you know what you know what joins us here more than anything else it's not good just good looks brother sister we're good-looking people right we're hard workers we love each other amen but what joins us more than anything else is our love for Jesus Christ Our Love for the word amen that we can what speak of the word amen know of the word understand the word and be yielded to the word so even to that point the word can be revealed through us amen amen hallelujah one more place we're going to take a little turn this morning well it's kind of a deep little simple thing we got going on here but we just trust it'll be a blessing to you Song of Solomon 8 verse 6. Song of Solomon 8 verse 6. I know years ago if I remember right brother Jesse had preached a series on the book of Song of Solomon and today we're going to take a little bit of a turn into that and we're you know how we like to do it I I just uh I like to go right through the word of God and prove that this message is absolutely 100 percent the word and will of God Amen you know doubters and and people who would scoff and leave this message and so forth let them be what they are but there is evidence plenty of it that this is right and we might as well just hold the course and election will take its place in our lives amen hallelujah Song of Solomon 8 6 and some very very interesting words here it says set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death look how strong love is strong as death people people die for love right there's no greater love than this that a man would lay his life down for his friends and that's what Jesus Christ did right jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of Fire which hath a most vehement Flame look at that there it is talking about a seal upon a heart hallelujah we're going to say a word of prayer I will pray greetings from the Saints from Living Waters and we'll say a prayer for them at home for the Simon is ministering there brother Jesse is ministering in Albion and we have been fortunate to be here this morning and we'll just say a prayer that the Lord will have his way now won't we let's just bow our heads forward of prayer Lord Jesus we come before you right now Lord and oh God from the inside how much we love you Lord we want to fulfill those scriptures oh God that the word is constantly in our mind meditating on it oh God that we're talking about it Lord because within the words coming from our mouth is wisdom and Grace can be given to the hearer strength can be given to the hero God your Bible said that what is as is a well of life that these words we could speak are or as a tree of life also it says in the Book of Proverbs Lord but we're asking this morning as we have come all of us dedicated to our love towards you Lord that you would come in a way this morning to meet our needs oh God that your anointing would come Lord your strength would come Lord and you'd be able God to bring us Revelation to draw us more closer to thee Lord that's what we want to be we want to be at a spot when this Rapture hits oh God that Lord there won't be a big change Lord we're so close to you Lord that's what we want we want to be so joined in heart and mind kind and soul to you Lord that Lord we're we're ready to go oh God every day ready to go so Lord we're just praying that you just bless this time that we have with one another uh blessed brother Jesse as he ministers and Albion bless uh the words that will come forth from his mouth as well as brother Simons at home Lord uh and allow all these words oh God to get your bride ready for thee Lord your scripture says in Ephesians 4 that what that that fivefold was given for the perfecting of the Saints oh God not those men or those individuals but oh God the word that is coming from them Lord so find o God within your heart today to bring the word oh God to bring a Perfection that is saints of God that they might be able to work harder and push more for you than ever before Oh God in a constant Revival as our Prophet said oh God we must be in a spot that we never let the spirit of Revival die in our lives may it be found today o God in the loving precious name of Jesus Christ we love you thank you and worship you now as we say Amen so be it amen you may have your seats I always come brother sister and uh it seems like the Lord's always doing something so I I like to encourage you you know when I come and uh just recently I uh it's probably a couple months ago now it might have been right after I I was here last but uh you know we had uh we have a new brother that's coming to church and and uh anyway he uh he had given me a call and he he had said he said uh I haven't told nobody about this yet he said but I I want to tell you about something that happened the other day in church and I'm like all right he's like I and he kind of you know he's kind of really kind of nervy and he said I uh I'm a little bit nervous to tell you this because I I don't want you to think I'm crazy and I said oh all right all right that's fine that's fine and uh he goes he goes the other day he said he said we all bowed her head when you were praying uh getting ready to minister and he said he said and when you said amen he said I looked up and he said you're probably going to think this crazy so this is a new believer you don't know much about the word of God he said and when I lifted my head up he said I seen a cloud up at the pulpit all around he said do you think that's crazy [Laughter] I said I'll tell you what it is it was the Shekinah Glory and God was opening your eyes to it being in our presence [Laughter] Hallelujah I said you might not know this and he didn't I said that holies of holies uh when that high priest would enter the holies of holies there there would be the Shekinah Glory a cloud or a miss that was above that Mercy Seat hold on Hallelujah and God said I will meet you there amen and you know by the scripture and by this message that's exactly where God is leading us amen he is what two thousand years ago he rent The Veil from top to bottom Amen to show that there are no longer was a separation from man from The Holy place to the holies of holies amen and but what it was now our responsibility to enter in and meet with him there amen hallelujah where the word was amen where Aaron's Rod was where that hidden manner was amen God has invited us in uh we are called to be partakers so let us be mindful of the Heavenly place that we sit in this morning amen you might not feel him you might not see him amen but the scripture promises that he is here amen hallelujah if he is here it don't matter if I'm here it doesn't matter if any one of us are here but what we bring to the table is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with once again enforces that God is in our midst amen Hallelujah so we can set our affection to things above we can look and expect uh and expect uh Tennessee uh that Christ is going to do something in our midst amen now we want to bring a little idea this morning it travels through the scripture so get ready that's kind of how we do things I can only preach what God opens my eyes to so I try to be very mindful of that but I know this I just long for the word to be open to me I long for that I long for Revelation this message brings us to Revelation that cannot be attained anywhere else amen and just the invitation from Christ himself to put us in a spot to receive it oh it speaks volumes amen remember your Prophet said that when you recognize that this message was Eagle food you actually heard from your theophany amen you heard from that what that Glory that Eternal essence of God known as your theophany amen you have a word body you've done heard from it it shows that what there's no fear or scare in this hallelujah how many times did Brother Branham say if we could just get away from the fear and scare he said you don't know who you are so what if we do know who we are then what God can do or what he can do things in this assembly that is so beyond our imagination right the scripture says he's able to do above all that we ask or sing amen God is wanting to do things that you can't even think it Hallelujah but in his time he will Manifest this love to you as you draw near to him amen Hallelujah so it took us a few minutes to get here but this morning we're going to minister on this idea the seal on Christ's heart the seal on Christ's heart now we know even as last time we spent a little bit of time working with a Signet but we know that God has sealed you he's placed a seal on your life amen now remember that is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Ephesians 1 13 it says in whom he also trusted we've got to trust God amen hallelujah it's coming don't worry hold on it's what it's right on time amen remember not one thing is out of cater with God hallelujah he's got you right where he wants you this morning but yet with the word he's trying to get a greater amen out here amen he's trying to get one more life out of you and his words are life amen they are spirit and they are our life amen watch this in whom he also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation you heard the word of Truth in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen so what God brought it so you would hear the truth so that he knew you would receive the truth and in receiving the truth he knew you would believe it so he could fill you with the Holy Ghost amen which was the down payment of your inheritance your Eternal inheritance the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just a down payment amen [Laughter] Hallelujah remember uh this uh in in the adoption message brother Branham said he said the first thing that God gave you was your inheritance [Laughter] hallelujah amen and what now you are showing that you are a partaker of that inheritance by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you cannot get away from this word amen amen until what unto the praise of his glory amen hallelujah your life is glorification to God Hallelujah don't expect God to do all of it right sometimes we expect God to convert Every Soul as far as to go out and and do this and do that but that's actually why he moved into the Son of God ministration from the Son of Man because he wanted to do it inside of you amen so you could see that you and Christ are together joined as one amen these twain shall be in one flesh amen and you can manifest his life to this world Amen now let me get moving I got a lot to say here so we found that what just like that seal he sealed you with there is a book in the right hand of God what the sealed book it has seals on it remember what are those to do it's to seal the contents in Hallelujah now remember that seal it represents a finished work that seal speaks of ownership and that seal speaks of security now think about that it was royalty's decree with a seal Hallelujah is generally the wealthy are those of power and they would have a seal and whatever they were sealing and nobody could touch it until it arrived at its destination you see if you've been sealed with the Holy Ghost nothing can touch you until you arrive at your destination amen he didn't say the finished product was when you received the Holy Ghost and you're absolutely 100 perfect that wasn't what it is amen hallelujah the only way you could ever be perfect is by the shed blood of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah because when he looks at you he has to look through his blood amen and then he looks at you and says I find no fault amen hallelujah amen so it shows you our finished work it shows his ownership over you and it shows what a security that you have in him but watch this we're going to do a big turn on this right now all right because that sounds really good these opening of the seals and so forth but now watch when we go into the most romantic book of the Bible watch when we go to the book in the Bible that gives us a red hot fire relationship between King Solomon and the shulamite now watch this I charge you o Daughters of Jerusalem they stir not up nor awake my love until he please Hallelujah so this is what the shulamite speaking here and she's saying don't you touch my beloved until he awakes when he wants to she's trying to keep everyone in accordance to his will right now watch us who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved ah notice I have that underline keep that in the back of your mind okay leaning upon her beloved I raise thee Up Under The Apple Tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bear thee and then he we move into the next part of this now watch there it is leaning upon her beloved right upon him she says notice how I said that she says set me as a seal upon thine heart what kind of deep terminology is going on here I'm sure it means something as a seal for love is strong as strawlessly as cruel as the grave the calls thereof are coals of fire which have a most vehement Flame many Waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would be utterly contempt or condemned all right there she is leaning upon her beloved and she has a moment of inspiration she has and she says setting me as a seal upon your heart the sealer is wanting amen let me say this right the one who seals has another that is calling for him to make her a seal upon him this is this is deep now this is good stuff here it's gonna be good all right Hallelujah because because what is this all about this is all about A Love Affair that this woman has for King Solomon King Solomon obviously a type of Christ the shulamite obviously a type of the bride of Christ she calls to him and says putting me as a seal upon your heart and upon your arm and then she explains why love is strong as death ah she wanted to be his only she wanted to be seen the one that mattered most to him I'm showing you your position jealousy is cruel as the grave you see as the prophet said there's a lot of brides as far as there's a lot of churches out there but there's only one bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we do not set ourselves down to a concubine level we do not set ourselves down and say well I guess we'll just be like the rest but notice the Cry of the heart of this Shula my woman she wanted to be set as a seal upon his heart when people now think about this so when people saw King Solomon she said let them see me why because she loved him that much [Laughter] you know what being the bride is you love him that much amen when the scripture says with all your heart amen oh God with all our heart we love thee amen Hallelujah now that's from that's not hey that's bride of Christ Fellowship you that's this is an individual Affair brother sister we're inviting all come in amen but it is up to every single one why because the Bible says every joint supplies it's up for you with your love to be part of that body amen you mean a bride would cry out remember your prophet and the church age brother Branham said that what he said that a first love experience in a church age book he said that was what that was typical of a man and a woman in their early start of marriage the fire that was there God don't want to lukewarm our love out of you in such a way he says I'd rather you be cold or hot not lukewarm but because you're lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth so what do we want to be I don't know about you don't want to be called don't want to be lukewarm oh God let us burn with the fire of the loving God Amen Hallelujah now remember this is in the word for a reason I'm going to show you this all right so notice just as the scripture says here if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would be utterly contempt well it'd be contemptible it would be that what people would disrespect him for that but when you look in the Bible Jesus said that what that when a man would find a pearl of a great price he would sell everything he had to get that Pearl that's what this message is you've got to sell all out amen and grab this pile of fire amen it's a pearl of great price this loving God that's called you to this Feast Hallelujah now let's move when you see a a reading I always read my commentators and spursion says something here is phenomenal he says the prayer you will notice referring to these scriptures is twofold although it is so really and essentially one set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm now what do you say it's too full but it's actually one now watch us oh Lord let me know that my name is engraved on thy heart not only let it be there but let me know it the hand to do think of the inspiration on this shulamite she is saying send me as a seal on your heart oh the wild that you love me but she said the arm too Hallelujah not only of your affection but that you would prove it Hallelujah that's why Jesus said the works that I do shall ye do and greater shall ye do because I go unto my father amen he's wanting to show the world that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the power of God did not die when brother Branham died it is on moving with the church amen and God expects us Amen to take the word and say yes God set me as a seal amen let everybody see that I love you amen let everybody see that what you're willing to do things for me because you love me this passionate love it manifests the omnipotent love that God has for you Solomon didn't hide this he didn't say well that's a little bit too deep you know because I got foolish virgins and I got I got those good to the bride I got all this and that we got other churches you know the big churches he didn't say that there it was that one woman how how many women did Solomon have 700 wives and 300 concubines a thousand he said one among a thousand I haven't found Hallelujah but here's one Hallelujah there's thousands of churches but oh God let there be found a place in this little assembly here amen that God can see our entire group set aside with a passion for Jesus Christ amen to love him to do his word amen to yield to him so he can manifest his what his heart and arm to you Hallelujah oh this is so beautiful let me know it see God don't God don't want you brother sister to go through a life and never see God do anything he wants you to cry out and say God let me know it Hallelujah set it upon thine arm too not just your heart your arm let the whole world see you see what I'm saying you know people fell out of the message because they see a lot of fallacies more more than with brother Branham they find it with the people that's why every time you see they're always what they're always really bitter against messaged people very angry that's not an excuse but I think sometimes their tail is not too far off because it becomes of us to live this message out Christ didn't give us this message I mean go go to uh go to messiah in in the Messiah messaging 61 and find out that what God made you an amateur God to display him to the world Hallelujah remember brother Branham said he said there was coming a time he said where it'll shut the mouths of the critics that shows that there will be critics but it also says that the god you serve will be so great in your life amen that it will shut their mouths amen Hallelujah what's your expectation yes the system is going down but the Bride of Jesus Christ is going up amen hallelujah we're coming to manifestation Time Lord Hallelujah write my name not only in thy heart but may it be as a Signet on the on the heart that I may see it see I want to see you love me God I want to say I love you Lord is that our prayers is how we live you see how I joined Deuteronomy with that at the beginning because remember he should be the Principal theme of our talk our walk our life our action our choices Christ is everything what is that that's the manifested bride right there two it says the spouse argues with her Lord thus it is my advantage that thou shouldest thus writs my name upon thine hand and heart for I know this concerning thy love that it is strong that it is firm and that is wondrous intensity and that it has a sure and unquenchable Eternity with these four please she backth up her suit when's the last time you just sat in the presence of God and the love of Jesus Christ flowing upon you you could almost you could almost not even move in the presence you know what I'm talking about some of you've been there Hallelujah we know what it's like we're at times you'll go through a service the Lord just refilled with the Holy Ghost and then and then you're like on that high for like days and you're like oh God let me stay here sure enough you think that and here comes the devil Hallelujah but that's what he wanted thank God for the mountains and the valleys because it reveals to us the place we're going amen so notice she knew what his love was like she knew the intensity of it and she wanted to claim that god Set me as a seal upon you wait think about that you have security finished product Hallelujah she said make me a seal on your heart let me be seen as the affection from your life hallelujah oh let's look a little bit more into the love letter now Song of Solomon 2 4 he brought me to the banqueting house and His Banner Over Me was love he took her into the banqueting house and His Banner over her was love he expressed the love towards her in such a way she seen it she knew it oh my God hallelujah you sing a song he brought me into his banqueting table Banner Over Me Is Love Hallelujah one time a lady sang that at the church a long time ago and she was like she got so into that song and you just felt the Holy Ghost come right down like wow she's got a banner over her Hallelujah stay with me flagons uh comfort me with apples for I am sick of love she was so madly in love with him she said I am sick of love or lovesick Hallelujah she was mine fully grass of the mind of this man amen you see what God wants from us oh I love Jesus amen hallelujah he is my oh and oh amen his left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me Again song Psalm 5 8 I charge your daughters of Jerusalem if you find my beloved that ye tell him that I am sick of love Hallelujah she was what in the company of the daughter she said when you see solving tell them I'm love sick for him I gotta see him amen hallelujah do we wake up the next morning when we wake up on Monday morning say oh God I need you today I am love sick for you amen hallelujah cause if we get in that type of condition what the windows of heaven will open and His blessings will pour out amen Hallelujah she had to push a little bit now didn't she spursia said she argues with him Hallelujah but what it's almost like an Esther huh she was going in there's no choice about it she had to what she had to go in for the answer amen she needed Deliverance she needed something from him we need something from him amen honey we need less laodicea and More Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah read this real quick I love this I love a passionate desire for God I hope you have that amen uh Psalm 63 1 the psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longer for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is you see how he's likening his condition to his need for God that's why the scripture says that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God we esteem his word his person greater than the very food we eat Hallelujah well show that amen Hallelujah you love God Hallelujah I'm feeling good because there's anointings here brother sister I hope I hope you're moving into it amen because what God wants from you is to what have a first love experience with you amen Hallelujah you realize you can't alter God's love for you now think about it the scripture says in first John what that God is love this whole person is known as love so when the devil would tell you that God don't love you or what you get that thought in your mind oh I'm such a horrible Christian how could he ever love me because he has a love that you can't understand [Laughter] Hallelujah hey if we be honest remember and James it says if you were offended at one point you're guilty of the whole brother random said what we backslide many times in a day there's a God who identified himself as long suffering there's a God that what he said he delighteth in Mercy amen hallelujah what do you want you want to love that God but love that merciful god amen [Laughter] Hallelujah remember he can only see you like he's seen you on that book [Laughter] oh my see we don't even know what he's prepared for us the scripture says that and what man knows what God has prepared for us for them that love him Hallelujah he loves you that much so what you need to do is disregard anything that says that omnipotent love can't love you see how can you miss it how could you miss it you're entering into his love [Laughter] Hallelujah that's why the scripture says if any man fail the grace of God how do you fail his grace you have to lay it down you have to realize that you you have to think that you don't deserve Grace is unmerited favor so in all the things you're doing every day you find yourself you are still unmerited you cannot earn being the Bride of Jesus Christ you cannot earn the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a gift Hallelujah so raise up your hands amen the god that loveth you amen has called you to a revelation that once you receive it you cannot get out of it hallelujah amen hallelujah how can I love him how can I worship my God how can I glorify the loving name of Jesus Christ amen Ma Hallelujah there's a song Oh How He Loves Us it's a truth brother sister Hallelujah so notice Psalm 63 2. to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary you realize David never went into the holies of holies he could not go into the holy place but he's still seen his power and His glory in the sanctuary see we get this picture we see the we see the Tabernacle and we're like yeah they're slaying animals and things like that and yeah you know it's just some sort of natural show it wasn't to David [Laughter] Hallelujah David was entering into a substitutionary measure of God's grace and he would see the power and the glory of God manifesting on him oh my soul if the substitution could produce that what about the innocent shed blood of the Living God Amen hallelujah what do you see today or she is power amen I see his glory amen Hallelujah his word hath declared it unto me amen because thy loving kindness is better than life his loving kindness that's how he loves you that's how his kindness is displayed through his love to you oh think about how many brother says I should have been dead already numerous times most of them by my own stupid Frailty hallelujah thank God thank God amen amen that there was a name in that book Hallelujah my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with mayor and fineness my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches he's thinking about God all the time he's worshiping God all the time isn't that the curse of laodicea the curse of laodicea isn't just that it puts evil in front of you but it puts every distraction in front of you take you away from this type of love with God Hallelujah because thou has thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I Rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee my right hand upholdeth me his right hand is power David realized at a point he couldn't even die he said Goliath there he's like all right uh you're going to be vulture me today Hallelujah he knew remember [Laughter] Hallelujah if he prayed David through then did he not also pray you through amen Hallelujah remember even in John something I haven't prayed for these alone Hallelujah but them they will hear the Lord from them amen Hallelujah you have followed the path where the word is went from the disciples from generation after generation and now it is fell upon your seed amen you quickened you are living in the power of the most high amen Hallelujah whether you feel or not you might as well say it amen Hallelujah I live by the right hand of God Amen Hallelujah Mike wasn't playing was she I love you so much set me as a seal on you you other girls you tell Solomon you don't think they wanted salmon to pay attention to them [Laughter] Hallelujah he said you see him you tell him I'm love sick for him Hallelujah all right ready now we're gonna take a little turn watch this Exodus 28 15. brother came where you going

this brother cam let's continue and the stone shall be with the names of the children of Israel 12. according to their names like the Engravings of a Signet be just like a Signet put it there think about that his name shall be they shall they be according to the 12 tribes I'm gonna jump forward I'm gonna jump back there's the breastplate of Aaron with the four rows of three remember the scripture says that engrave it like a Signet what does Signet make a seal a Signet made a seal watch this Exodus 28 29. continuing to talk about the breastplate and Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart the names of Israel engraved like a Signet upon what upon his heart you see what was going on in Song of Solomon is God was manifesting a deeper picture of his will and so much the fact is she was only fulfilling what his desire was the whole time when he goes and under the holy place for a memorial before the Lord continually for the high priest to go into the holies of holies God required that the names of Israel would be like what would be upon his heart get it set me as a seal upon thine heart think about it solving walking forward she was crying like nebius ill upon that heart you know Spurgeon said of course it is it is one and the same you have the heart but the heart will actually bring forth an action right if we love God we have one we give them our hearts but what does he do he brings forth action remember you're a type of the seraphim had six wings three pairs of two Hallelujah you have reverence humility and what action [Laughter] brother Branham said that those seraphims they needed those wings to stay in the presence of God and the one quote he said to live in the presence of God do we want to live in the presence of God this message shows us how to do it you in amen watch us and thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the urum and the filament which remembers what which is what that's brother Branson that was the word and they shall be upon Aaron's heart and your Prophet said that that was the breastplate that's what it was those stones remember when they would inquire of them they would light up to show the will of God wait a minute don't you see it if the representation holds true you should light up to manifest the word of God the will of God oh and Aaron shall bear the Judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually notice so now we have a seal and now we have what who is a seal the shuomite was which is the type of his church was upon his heart now Aaron in like fashion before this God ordains him that to go into the presence of God he needs to have what the 12 tribes the Engravings of a Signet to manifest in this presence that's how the how it would be accepted oh I love it once again so first and foremost what's the great adorning here the greatest adorning that that what the high priest was walking in is with what Israel's love for him and his love for them why did why the hill of divorcement divorcement because they didn't love him but he said at the end he would gather them up amen On Eagle's Wings amen two prophets are coming brother sister our time is almost done glory to God now watch so there we have what they'd have the Engravings as a Signet of all the names set me as a seal don't worry I ain't done I'm still going Oh Glory well who's the high priest who's this who's Aaron was only a type of Jesus Christ right we know that seeing that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession Hallelujah so you have to believe that Jesus is God but what also do you have to believe what was he doing he was bearing Israel continually into the presence of God so if we have a high priest right now what is he bearing before God that's right he is bury your iniquities he's being all that would condemn you and what he is saying that you are accepted in his sacrifice as a high priest I can't help get excited this is a revelation of who we are brother sister oh my well good thing the scripture is not over because there's more there to make you excited so he says what for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of your infirmities your sickness your Sorrows your Temptations the high priest that's bearing you before God was what he's holding you there right now but what what but what he's touched with the feeling of it he knows your sorrows amen he knows those habits and those things that you can't get out of he's holding them before God stay in God and they will fall amen you see the blood of Jesus Christ cannot fail it cannot fail to make you perfect amen oh Hallelujah what was he what he wants our love he wants us to love him he wants you to say set me upon your heart set me like a seal on your heart think about it they seen her they seen him laughs Hallelujah but was an all points tempted like as we are yet without sin not no sin to this God he sent us that means he can take your sin and take it in and it's gone Hallelujah but you see how far does that go does that go only to a spot that you're accepted in the Beloved goes farther than that doesn't it let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace see fail Grace boldly through Grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in a time of need Hallelujah you know a lot of times why our issues and situations last and persevere longer than they're supposed to because we don't do this This Can't Fail you can be the darkest Battle of your life this can't fail it can look impossible This Can't Fail amen Hallelujah brother sister there's a squeeze coming do you realize that there is a squeeze that's coming it's really close right now Gotta Have It got to have it let's make another turn there's your Old Testament could there be a new testament with this too I am provoking to love today I'm doing what I can through the word to provoke you to love your God greater because you're only come to a place you're expressing exactly what he desired to begin with foreign Hallelujah that's why you prophesied they said if you say something say I'm that one and one I'm going to make it I love my God Amen I'll worship my Lord I'm accepted because that's what you're saying I'm accepted I'm predestinated I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ the sinless Spotless virgin bride of Jesus Christ amen watch us when Jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake now now now now there was leading on Jesus bosom remember Song of Solomon there she was walking leaning on his bosom where is the bosom now that was leaning on Jesus bosom one of his disciples Now watch how it ties in home Jesus loved what Authority does he have what Authority does John have to say I'm a disciple that Jesus loves foreign you see the revelation the shirt of I knew that Solomon loved her which brought her to a place of authority that she could say he loves me but her life was so great she said send me as a seal upon you I love you unconditionally ah I want to be your bride whom Jesus loved Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it is should be of whom he spake he then lying on Jesus breast saith unto him Lord who is it you realize that John was the only one that was in a capacity that he could do this you know there's people especially you know even within our modern culture that they are saying that there was that was homosexual things there because they can't understand real love this was manifesting how tight-knit that John and Jesus were John's revelation of his love towards Jesus but he had a revelation of how much Jesus loved him he was so tight to Jesus that he could ask who Jesus Judas was and Jesus would tell him he was the one who knew who the deceiver was we know Peter probed him to do it but never says where he told Peter because where was he he was lying in Jesus breast Lord who is it how do you we we want to be the you know you know people in the message always ours is like yep that yep that I always knew he's surprised oh I knew his serpent serpenter that's not what this is this is love brother sister but it's going to come into play later Hallelujah Jesus answered he it is to whom I give a sop when I have dipped it and when he had dipped the SOP he gave it to Judas Iscariot the son of Simon notice is what I love you ever notice how they draw this they like John oh he's laying right up Hallelujah [Applause] you see he was setting himself as a seal upon the Heart of Jesus he [Applause] [Laughter] said Glory what am I trying to tell you you have a position with Jesus Christ get in the bosom it is an ordained revelation of your positional placement with Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah remember we are no more foreigners and strangers Hallelujah behold we are the family of God right a few more we're almost done John 21 4 but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore of course after Resurrection but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus then Jesus said to them children have you any meat and they answered him no and he said to them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of fishes therefore the dis that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter it is the Lord who had a revelation of the resurrected Christ he had to tell Peter you know why I'm saying this because there's a lot of doctrines that fly around this message but the bride will see the true resurrected Christ Hallelujah remember it's going to be so close it would deceive the elected if possible polygamy ain't that brother sister Two Souls ain't that it's going to be close well how will I know I'll tell you because you are the disciple whom Jesus loved amen hallelujah now when Peter heard that it was the Lord he gurt his Fisher's coat unto him before he was naked and did cast himself in the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes ah Peter needed that Hallelujah so you see that placing of the seal upon the heart Old Testament New Testament and Song of Solomon really brings to light her revelation of her position but what is it she knows how much God loves her and she is love sick for him Hallelujah John 21 20. then Peter turning about see the disciple whom Jesus loved following it is always he's saying he's always referring to himself as a disciple that Jesus loves you see they can tell you that that you're a call that you're a counterfeit that you're a failure undoubtedly they did the same thing to John remember diatrophes and third John would not even accept John into his church remember diographies who love it the preeminence he wouldn't even let John in the church but John said that what it was the disciple that Jesus loved amen he's not trying to brag he would address it would have Brad he could have wrote a lot bit different than this and it was me John the great disciple amazing disciple that Jesus loved but watch the humility because here's the thing who wrote that God is love John yeah first John 4. Hallelujah went to oh what first John always talking about the love love love love love what Peter James John faith hope love but wait John's the type of the Bride so what are you yeah Hallelujah then Peter almost done turning about see the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper you think those disciples they were looking at John they knew all about John Hallelujah but John John didn't say man actually you know I'm not good enough I shouldn't I shouldn't be like that I should never lean on Jesus breast that would not be right I can't do it but he was moved to do it were those other disciples his bride shower were they part of his church yeah but John John had a position there and this is where it comes in watch us then Peter turned about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also lean on his breath of supper and said Lord which is he that that that uh which is he that betrayeth thee Peter's seeing him saith to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do and Jesus saith unto him if I will that he tarry till I come what is that to thee follow thou me and then there is what there was a rumor that went through the church that John would see the rapture and ultimately John was the only one that wasn't martyred they tried to murder him but they couldn't they tried to boil boil them with oil yes couldn't boil he had so much oil on him the oil couldn't burn not him Hallelujah amen Hallelujah so what what's appointed for the one that leans Upon Jesus breast he's going to see the Lord's coming [Music] [Laughter] why because the church a type of John now think about this this goes you could take this all the way back to the Old Testament you had David and Jonathan David was a type of Christ Jonathan was a type of John Hallelujah but what does that tell you that tells you how much he loves you he's revealed the word to me I get it let's stand thank you for patience I went right around an hour and 15 almost Hallelujah amen you see let the word move you into a place that you love him more why is that in there why does all that tie in in parallel why does that do that because Christ is trying to bring a revealed word in the season to positionally place you so think about that I don't know how I can love God more don't worry about that say God I love you more be a product of your spoken word amen Hallelujah brother Brown said there's a quote I hope I can I can say this right but brother random said he said he said if you don't have the Holy Ghost he said just keep on saying it and God will end up giving it to you keep believing hold to that because you think you can't say it without believing it you see what I'm saying because if you don't believe it you'll just quit saying yeah if that ain't your passion you'll quit saying it but remember they that hunger and thirst for a righteousness sake shall be filled amen that shows your hunger Hallelujah so what's our prayer today at me as a seal upon thine heart and upon you think Paul knew it who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect who's gonna land on you brother who's got land charge on you nobody it is God that justifies amen amen what is that right you realize two weeks before brother and brother brahm's Ministry ended the very end of 65. he said now my Revelation is this he says you're Justified you never did it in the first place you realize right after that God took him home who's going to lay a charge to you you see how this Revelation should have kicked in you see what the challenges are it's right there well I do believe it nobody can lay a charge to you not that you willfully sin not even say Oh Glory I gotta I got a card to send for free now ain't that because if you do that it shows you don't even love them but you got this you got this thing you gotta fight all the time you stay in love with Jesus keep serving Jesus and don't worry you'll draw closer amen who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make an intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ you can't be separated from her you can do you believe you can because you can if someone's telling you you can't then is that God or is that the devil it'd be the devil because this says you can't be separated does he love you he does how about tribulation got separating no how about distress nope persecution nope famine nakedness Peril sword nope as is written for thy sake we are all we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us remember 64 question answers brother Ram said he said he said on this side of the river he said we don't have to wear a martyr's crown so what should you believe it's coming brother sister it's going to look like you could be murdered but remember if you've already found Grace with him you're going to walk right through it just like Jesus did he couldn't be taken until his time he couldn't be taking a crucifixion until his time but you cannot be taken to crucifixion or martyrdom because you are already crucified with him God so you see you've got to believe it you've got to love him and you've got to realize that his love says this about you Frank persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor personalities nor powers or nor things present nor things that come nor height nor debt nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord thank you Hallelujah I hope you're feeling here because he is hallelujah brother sister I'm I am a failure in myself but in Christ I am free amen hallelujah I can't live this out like I want to or like I see it but I know he loves me and he's bringing me to it Hallelujah so what do you call him today what does this tell you today it says that you were born he made you to Manifest this love to him well remember John had to say give me the book not in a disrespect he did what God told him to do and the shulamite was moved on by the word surrounding her he said set me as a seal on your heart in your arm when they see me let them see you foreign Hallelujah and since you can't see him anymore where are they going to see him in you hallelujah how many love them you love him amen hallelujah he loves you Hallelujah so with that being spoke how many say God when people see me let them see you that's what I want I want people to see my love towards you I want people to see that I'm love sick for you all the time God that you're constantly on my mind you're constantly on my heart oh God I want a baptism of the Holy Ghost I can show no other thing God I want the world to see
