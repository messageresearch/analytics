verse 18 grace I like to look at part 10 of our fear series by God's grace part 10 the grace of all I wanted to look at the law of perfect love art to live did that a few I think leaders last Sunday if I'm not mistaken I like to look at that thought again here by the grace of the Lord there's 19 quotes on perfect love I'm casting out all fear so I went through those thoughts we're given from the Word of God to did really blessed here let me notice everything see first John 4:18 you start there let me thankful for perfect love today what we must have first before we can even have a face we must have enough praise God first John 4:18 let's read together if you have in your Bibles first John 2:18 you don't breathe 1 2 3 there is no fear in love but perfect beer casted I'm sorry perfect love casteth out fear part me because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love mrs. Barnes workfare if a need on your heart just make known to God as we go before the Lord here I'd only father roll my hands up Lord I'm sure their hands may be up the Father I pray you to meet the need of every heart Lord that's hungry for righteousness that's thirsty for holiness Lord you said you fill every hungry and thirsty heart you promised it Lord you're not a god that breaks promises or you keep it so we know Lord we are truly hungry and truly thirsty today we shall be filled Lord God with your blessings with the desires of our hearts to be more like you Lord Jesus thank you that perfect love casts out all fear and help us to understand this law on your prophets head of numerous times this is the law of God it's another principle Lord a spiritual one father God just like natural ones with gravity Lord Godin and chaos and all these things Lord God Father but this is a spiritual law so much more important dear God and we ask the Lord God that your sphere would minister to us or homely coming before you bowing our heads before you we've worship You Lord you sang your praises Lord God we're thankful for the Lamb of God who took away our sins at Calvary father teach us to walk in your paths Lord God Father that we might glorify you on this earth Lord during our our vapor of life through our God in our lives are just a vapor upon this earth of us to glorify you with all we have Nord let's be faithful may be said well done my good and faithful servant enter ye into the joys of the Lord have been prepared for you from the foundation of the world we love you Lord unless justice this day Lord Jesus Christ II never said he meant God that should be the Lord one could mean house lourdes morning and looking forward to where's the Lord this morning we like to look at the law of perfect love this morning by God's grace tonight we'll be doing a Bible study on sanctification and so we'll just go Bible study with questions and answers so we'll have everybody who comes to necks in the front row and we'll take questions about sanctification it's kind of Felton led to go that direction so we'll look at sanctification here tonight the grace of the Lord so we're looking at our thought here this morning of the law of perfect love I want to review this quotation this is from 1954 Jarius and divine healing now the Prophet said the only thing that we can do is work according to the law of God for our healing and the Prophet said what is the law of God he answers his own question is love perfect love any quotes first Peter 14 perfect love casts out all fear the Prophet said love and faith is the same thing see love perfect love casts out all fear which gives us faith so we can't have any faith as long as there's fear in our minds or in our hearts we must have love first then when love fully feels our thoughts and our minds then we can have love and that love casts out all fear and then we can have perfect faith in God's Word the Prophet said it's a love as the law now you said if you'll just love God with all your heart and if you've done something to your neighbor or somebody just say in your heart now I love them too or if you said if you criticize me just say Lord with brother branham I'm criticized a little bit but I love you anyhow so brother Branham dealt with that in he said if you have a criticism toward me you must say Lord I love brother Branham anyhow even though I criticized him I still love him I'm brother man so that's the love of God the law so I want to remind us that this man is a three-part being all said the very God of peace will sanctify you wholly and I pray you're a whole spirit soul and body be preserved blameless and the coming of the Lord Jesus now I always loved the beginning of my school year I started this year and a few years ago our district bought the book called the seven Habits of happy kids and it's a book from the cubby family he's the man who wrote the seven most ways to be effective or something like that I forget the name of it the seven Habits of Highly Effective People thank you guys and his son Sean Covey I believe it if I'm not mistaken wrote this book and so our district bought it and supportive so once the district buys it it's good forever unless they get it out you know the board has to approve all the books so in Chapter seven of this book is the last habit and that's called balance feels best and so I get to teach my kids every year that they have three parts and there being a body soul and spirit because that's actually in the book I could use cartoon characters and this week I got to teach them that I said you have a body soul and spirit and I love how I get to teach the Word of God right there in school and it's not it's imported by the district whether they know it or not but the Bible says we have three parts so we have are what the Bible said we have a body at your physical nature of course then you have your human spirit or we call it the mind that there's our mind everybody has in mind huh and then everybody has a soul the soul is the inside of the inside we know that by the grace of the Lord somebody has a body mind and soul now if you have your Bibles go to mark 12:30 if you would the other battles mark 12:30 gabba 12:30 and I've always based you know my doctorate am i teaching upon the true Word of God I mean no there's no contradictions in God's Word amen but yet God allows so many details in the word that it causes the unbelief or the stumble but he said with father son Holy Ghost Loretta said that was Jesus talking in mystery he said but the unbelievers or make leader stumble over that and cut down to three persons but brother branham said well Graham said if Jesus was still here he would have said the same thing today i baptize to the baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost because there's a mystery behind it because only the true children of God would really seek out the revelation of the mystery it's the honor and glory of Kings to search out of matter who Jesus no superficial Christianity will never get the revelation of the word of God it takes somebody that really wants to know God something that wants to dig down and God's Word and find a vein of gold amen the may no syllable redemption and deity Jesus knows the real believer knows that what a surface level relationship they want to go deep at the things of God that's why Jesus today went to snow set baptized the name of the cars only ghost and then when someone got the Holy Ghost they would have said Jesus Christ baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because God loves to hide himself from the wise and prudent interview themself in debates such as would learn now mark 12:30 you got your Bibles here jesus said this and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment now this might stumble people but Jesus use for descriptions and if you apply those four to the three realms of man what you'll find is that heart represents emotions because we'll see in a few slides you know what Jeremiah and ha Group said about about the heart the heart is deceitfully wicked above all things in other words your emotions control by your human sinful nature is wicked above all things because your emotion you can feel good when somebody falls into sin but that's evil well I really want to see this person fall could my emotions are telling you that's a good thing that's an evil thing right or I really want to get back at that person or I really want to get this money or I really want to get this another relationship that's unlawful by the Word of God like hair and running are odious is known as emotions one but that's evil that's when your emotions are deceitfully wicked in the bubble above all things so Jesus said love God with all your heart which is your emotions which is one of those five realms in your human spirit and he said love God with all your soul that's your nature they said love God with all your might not the other four parts of your human mind and then he said love God with all your strength everybody here has used your human strength to come to the house of God this morning aren't you glad you're here not in the hospital we're laying in the mall or something like that we're very blessed to be able to use our human strength remember the house of the Lord so we see this is how Jesus says we must have love and remember the law of God rovaire said is love and what's the greatest commandment love jesus said you have to love God with all your body soul mind and strength in other words all of your being must have the love of God flowing through it now let me back this up the heart means your emotion jesus said love God with all your heart if you read the whole Old Testament you'll see that heart represents emotions because the box Jeremias at the heart of the secretly wicked above all things and so see your emotions must be brought into life to the Word of God if your emotions are against the Word of God you have to cast out your emotions if it's a memory I'm not going to listen to them I'm not gonna act upon them I'm gonna act upon God's Word amen we all feel that like for example with my children I might get upset with my children and and I shouldn't do that but I've got to take that emotion I've gotta say God forgive me help me not to be angry help me to be patient amen that's right and then the book of Proverbs that above all guard your heart for out of it flows the issue of life so either your emotions flows your life right here your heck your joy your sad or your life flows out through people sometimes go to their emotions on their sleeve right you can tell them they're down you can tell them they're up you can tell because out of their emotions flows what's in their heart and mind right so we know heart means emotions so Jesus says love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength and this is the law god it's only by doing this loving God with all of you and you would have anything because you have enough that love first that casts out all fear and then perfect love I break spacing then Galatians 5:6 says a love operates faith a net so here's the next one we must love God with all of our heart and mind then we can add a fake we can't have any faith in God's Word do we have God's love in every part of our being you must love God with our body you must make our body obey the love of God we must have love in our soul for the word of the Lord amen we must have love in our affections which is our emotions we must have God's emotions we must not we must love God with our conscience meaning that I know I've done the right thing I have a good conscience toward God I don't have a bad conscience now I know I didn't make that Rider we must have love in our conscience we must have love in our memory we must bring up things we must not bring up things under the blood grace God you must never have the bad memories and and dwell on those bad memories I remember when she did this to me I remember when he did that to me that's not having love love forgets those things any man love remembers the good parts about people that's what divine love does but see that's my people many many people can't have faith because they they they stopped up love their flu SIA carved up in one of these they have the wrong emotions they live off the wrong emotions they have a bad conscience toward God they're not clean toward God they remember all the bad things and then they reached and the reason God's words that's okay if I can break the word here it's okay if I break the word there God understands and so love doesn't flow through there until they just reason and say I'm going to Vegas word above all things and then that's real love when you obey God's word above all things and you reason with the word you take God's word rather than your own mind and here's where we get a lot of complexes in imagination or maybe laughs people can imagine all I only was married to that person or if I'm only married to that person imagine a magining things well God's love is not in that phrase God God's love is according to word right or some people match all this sister or the preacher or the song you play or something they must have this against me because they're treating me like this or treating me like that when when someone accepts those socks there's not the love of God in there and so because there's no love in there they can operate people have a hard time believing God will answer their prayer does that make sense by God's grace I'll get upset if you get in the greatest battle her fault if you have a list of that he says whenever we get something clogged up in here cause up the love of God in our minds and then the love that's in our soul can't flow out through my mind and we can't speak God's Word you can't believe God's Word we can't act the right way because sin has clogged up God's love I'm not love the threw all their beans hey man this is permanent this is the law of God it's got to flow out so let me go back see if I can go back here but let me go back okay let me go back to there yes I think I'm just go back to here so we have to have love in our soul for God and who cross the greatest battles letting love flow through our mind we always think bad thoughts we often imagine the wrong thing and we'll remember the wrong thing rather letting the love of God of our minds and then straight have you got all of our strength making the human sacrifices of our body possible we must do that and the Prophet said if you'll just love God without her heart and if you've done something to your neighbor just taking your heart now I love them Jude so see he's trying to get the love to flow from the soul out to the mind and out to the body throw bang God's words that help by the grace of Lord I hope that helps somebody now let me read a few quotes if I can these quotes say that love is prerequisite to faith if you've ever gone to university or high school you know there are prerequisite courses right you have to take these courses first before you get to your major courses right so brother Adam says this he says a personal experience with God that you're looking for always say we have faith we have love but if we had love we'd have faith because perfect love casts out all fear and when fear is gone faith is perfect you're scared he won't keep his word but I believe he does amen so see this is the first commandment we must have love first then we can have faith in God's Word let me read this with next this is from the way to fellowship 1955 he said that's what's the trouble with the people tonight you're scared that's the biggest curse there is on the blue gospel beat book or any other people did you catch that the greatest cursed is to be fearful that's the greatest curse he says God has made provision but you're afraid to take this word for it if you want afraid tonight why you would take your healing by faith and know that God promised it and the thing would just so blow them away from you afraid scared and I've noticed that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing I know that if you can get away from that scare and get love in its place something's going to happen amen father there we go he said the only way you can have faith is to have love first let's say love first ready love first the only way you could happen how many want faith that's the assurance of God's going to keep his word before you can have the faith you've got to have love first the Prophet said the Bible says that for love produces faith love has to come before faith we must love God first then faith flows out from that love he says you get it perfect love casts out all fear I remember the story of the killer blow he read he rehearses the story for us and he says when I started to cross the field right on the big open field not 30 yards from me this big fellow raised up through his horns down and let out a big bellow if you know what I'm talking about and there he was horns like this and here he come so I was walking across the field trying to pray for somebody and a big bull races up in this hole I was charging a brother branham program said at first it scared me I thought you got the Holy Ghost brother man he does have the Holy Ghost but its first human reaction is fear at first it scared me I look for a tree that wasn't any tree I know he could outrun me to the bed so I thought well this is it so he's already fearful and they said well this is the end of me here's my death and that's how it will experience to write our first human reaction is normally fear he said but then he says then something happened he said Oh God if that would only stay there instead of going away that love he's talking about something happened I wish God would let it happen to everybody here tonight just long enough to get healed amen see that what are we talking about we're talking about the revelation of God's love we're not living from the human mind but letting the love of God flow out from our soul the revelation that God loves us and we love God we say casting down fear right casting down a beer and letting love take control of our minds he said something happened now that I wasn't scared of a goal I felt sorry because I disturbed him I was in his field they said fellow I'm sorry I disturbed you he said now you're God's creature and I'm God's servant now the Creator has made you that made me I am a servant and I'm on my journey across the hill to pray for one of his sick children if I know you've been laying there I wouldn't combine disturb you so now in the name of Jesus Christ go back and lay down no he's saying that in the matter of the Bulls running at him he said don't lay down the name of Jesus Christ so he was scared at first but then love took over how many glad God's grace takes over for us we were fearful first but then if we really got love and give them a chance will that love anoint our mind the love will come if we've got love it will come and then it will flow out to believe God's Word if prophets and the judgments are you'll see that Barton's alive the bull looked at me to walk lay down he said that I walked right past it within 5 feet of him he said why did he do it because instead of hating him I loved him love will conquer anything so love conquered fear said it first but because he had to my love love to go over praise God remember God will never give you a battle you can't handle and he promised there's no way out what was the way out love what's the way out for you today love love God trust God believe God's words now look what he says this this is beautiful he says love will conquer anything that's what conquered my heart when I know that God so loved me and gave His only begotten Son that I wouldn't have to perish a day what does brother Adam say where this love come from it comes from the Gospel of John 3:16 amen I know the churches miss you John 3:16 I know they miss apply it where did brother Hyrum say is safety came from knowing that God loved him and Charlie 3:16 the love of God is what inspired him to know God loves me and God is going to get me away from this killer goal John 3:16 that God so loved riding Christ fellowship God so loved brother song so sister so-and-so God so loved me that he sent me a son and that love will conquer a killer bull or a killer mind battle or a killer disease that love will come for that it will just love God Mac he said I know that I was born in this world a sinner in perishing and God loved me that he gave his son for my life to be redeemed and I couldn't hate no more I had to love that's what these results I'm sorry that's what brings results that you see it's love any minute so what's going to bring results in your life loving God more grace God it's gonna be this loving God with your heart never all your emotions everything in your mind your soul and your body I let all those love God and that will bring results amen next he tells about the Hornet remember the hornet's nest he's mulling in his backyard he said he had a you know bare naked chest is what he said he took off his shirt and he said at first I was truly scared truly he says so in both cases of a killer bull Hornets though stadium right in both cases fear set in first because that's the natural human reaction but in both cases love took over he said after that I said oh I'm sorry I hit those fellows not because I was afraid I was going to get done but really it sounds juvenile but if we could just be more Tuvan I'll humbly would say help me to be more tubing up tell me about more childlike faith we could just be more childlike it's the simplicity of God that surged college students around he says be simple in these things looks like a baby just rely and believe don't try to push yourself just relax don't try to work yourself up Oh God oh no yeah how big are we good he said that's no good just believe it and walk on amen he said love I can't produce it I can't work it up God's got to give it so but I'm innocent God gave me his love with John 3:16 and he kept believing and keep loving and then then this love I know God loves me I've obeyed all God's Word then it flows down to all the battles that we face in life hallelujah now look at this when you separate from divine love he says the same quote you can't overlook another brother's mistakes no more so now I brings it down to our local church or your mother sisters in Christ see so when people live in here they can't forgive from their mind somebody's commit to that one let me see it back to that one they remember like I said oh no they just remember everybody's fault they can't overlook that I can't treat this brother better because he just did this and he's that mother random said when you separate from / we can't overlook your cutters mistakes so more now listen you've got the ballin out for it you got the bottom out you can't overlook your sisters mistakes no more because you got away from that divided love part but if you really love the Lord Jesus if a sister or brother does something to you oh well that's all right they didn't mean to do it that's the kind of love that Christ I forgive them they don't know what they're doing my dad brings it down so starts out bulls and hornets and then he brings it down to how do you treat your brothers and sisters we need to overlook their faults and say I love them anyhow well RAM said what if Jesus had said held my sins against me this is how we can forgive others because we know Christ forgives us what an awful person I was but he loved me so well and if he forgave me for them when I was son then if he forgave me he loved me with the pure love and that's how I often forgive others how many want to forgive others I've sinned against you if you have divine love that forgiveness will overlook their faults now that doesn't mean you have to do Matthew 18 if somebody sins against you you're really learning he to go to talk to them about this right you go face to face positive about that there's something wrong and you don't do that and the Bible said that leaven will grow up in the church we've got to do that and what drives you to that divine love drives you to that it's exactly right don't see this one there's another chord about this love it's a prerequisite for faith we must have this the proper said we have great things we can do in the realm of faith even great works for us to tell our faith till you have love that's just all there is to it perfect love casts out all fear as long as you got fear you can't have faith so you got to have love first it drives all fear out and then faith comes in and takes the place of fear I want to give you one more quote that you can't have faith without having love you can't have faith and fear at the same time you've got to have divine love [Music] I carried this next one here by the grade school I think you like this my name's talking about his own life he says brother when you come to a place where you got loved it will never fail that's right how many believe that when you have loved it love can never fail I'm no scripture says that he said if I if my wife trusted me because I gave her ten dollars every time I left my brother that wouldn't be very much sign that I loved her like to pay it off to be faithful he said but when she knows that I love her when I know she loves me there's a perfect trust between each other no worry at all then when you got perfect love of God in your heart you don't question God about anything when the Bible says I'm the LORD thy God that heals all that diseases you say Amen Lord that's right that's me he says that settles it anything God says you love him so much you believe it oh I feel religious right now to think that perfect love casts out all fear you're not scared about nothing you're just resting he says you're not thinking this so listen there as I read this you're not thinking this oh I'm a backside tomorrow I'm a backside next week hear that brother Rand says when you got love in your heart you don't worry about backsliding next week you don't worry about Mack siding next year because he says you've got love in your heart he said I won't worry about that he said I'm not trying to hold on Jesus is holding on for me hard on the gun and Jesus put a love in my heart that holds fair it's Jesus holding me not me holding him if it was me holding him I'd probably turn loose but as long as he's holding me he'll never turn me loose jesus promised he wouldn't even Oh glory I hope you like that jesus said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee either here's my words that believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life praise the Lord program person as long as I know there's something in me making me love the Lord Jesus oh well I don't want to do wrong I'm angered how many feel that in your heart there's something in your heart that makes you love Jesus so much you don't want to do wrong and you feel anchored to God Almighty I already feel that way there should be love in our hearts that I feel anchor I'm not worried about falling away and personally I'm not wearing out falling away because he's holding on to me because his love is holding on to me hallelujah brother Branham said if I tried to say well I quit this and I put that he said I doubt you ever quit it but when something in here happens he says that's what does it and they tell the story about loosing his first wife hope and Sharon rose and a brother came up and asked him afterwards that Billy how are you feeling now remember he just lost his wife and his child he said mr. Eisler you know how I'm feeling we said I want to ask you one thing solid Billy all right ask me mr. Eisler what do you think about the Lord Jesus now after he'd taken your baby your wife everything you had I turned around took him by the hand looked him in the eye and said senator I want to tell you something he's more than life to me amen can you imagine losing a dear family member and something come up and ask you what is it Jesus meeting you now he said more than life to me look what he says next he said do you love him then I said I love Jesus with all my heart soul mind and strength how can brother bear him still love because he's not basing his love for God on these he's basing his love upon the Word of God he could have had a memory and say what God took my wife or God took my baby I just can't believe God loves me and he could have stopped loving God but instead of believing these all these were lined up with the Word of God he didn't believe any of these if they weren't in obedience to the word and the mister Iser said the senator said well what about after taking your item baby and my man said though he would send me to hell if there's such a thing I could still I love them anyhow he's always right and I'm boy strong and I love you I didn't say that this morning Jesus is always right what he allowed to happen in my life he's always right I'm not going to get upset at Christ I've been a lot of Christ but Graham said I'm so glad to know that by grace he put that in my heart that powerful thing of love it conquers you know conquer when you lose our dear one love will conquer that I'll conquer when you go through difficult times and it will conquer local conquerors Greed's and temptations and lust love will conquer all that that's what love is therefore to do to conquer all things Amen hallelujah so can everybody see this love is prerequisite we've got to have love before you can have faith in God you've got to love God with all your heart soul mind and strength we must love him here's another one I want to bring out another quotation one of the greatest hindrance I know in the church today right here in Edmonton or Prince Albert says is fear but blood of perfect love casts out fear the reason you're fearful is because the right temperance of love has never entered yet that's he says when there's real love all fear passes away any bed can ever understand that if we fear about anything in life it's because we don't have enough love how many want more love of God programs that we don't have the right temperance of love has never entered into us yet Oh God's love more than anything else amen to love God with all our heart soul mind and strength that will cast out every fear every doubt here's our honor it is to profession I'm not condemning you I'm only trying to bring something to light that you could look at so he's telling them you can if you have any fear you don't have enough love if he says I'm not condemning you I'm just trying to bring the light to your life you can see conditioned urine I'm gonna appreciate that preacher sometimes up the ball out deep part things but a real preacher is it trying to condemn people they're trying to help people praise God and the program says the same thing so the thing of it is it's a lack of love a profit center no matter how many prophecies we have how many great preachers I'm gonna see algae we know how great church who we belong to if love does it temper that together it's a nun effect he said what the church is lacking is divine love I don't mean affection in love for one another I mean the agape love the godly love and have it so richly into your heart until you just love the Lord and everything just take his word for it you don't mistrust him amen Gloria you don't want to mistrust the Lord now look what he says here he tells the story again if he goes overseas his wife doesn't have to grab him by the neck ties they promise me you'll be faithful remember that Club promise me be faithful she said let me tell you good man you know let me tell you my wife I love that story but ma'am said now if somebody would come to me and say mrs. Branham it's not true to you brother branham can you mention that somebody gave you said your wife is a faithful to you your husband is a banquet to brother Graham said we should have enough love to tell them they're wrong amen he says I wouldn't believe it you couldn't make me believe it no sir pride confidence in love they did it he said you couldn't make me believe my wife wasn't true to me why because I've got love for her I know she would have sinned against me Gloria and I'd say oh you reckon she is what will happen to my children the devil would say see oh so that's the wrong oh maybe she is on pavement what's gonna happen to my children fear can settle in that quick when someone brings doubt or someone brings confusion but brother there's a no I wouldn't believe in the first place because I love her and as long as I love her that way I've got that confidence in her as a woman grace not a man you see that so love produces conference that's why I said last week you know when people say I've lost confidence in this person I lost confidence in that person sometimes that's some of the hardest words to hear like I do a bastard but at numerous families sleeping search he told me that he said all these people that had told me they have no more confidence I mean he's crying on the phone and these maybe these dear families didn't know what they were saying but they're basically saying we don't have love for you because love produces faith and faith is confidence he's God and brothers and I have confidence in my wife that when I leave to go overseas and the people trying to tell me she's unfaithful he said I can't believe that because I've got confidence I love her she loves me love produces confidence they've met it's exactly right remember no matter what you say the days of miracles is fast God don't do this God don't do that he said you might adjust well save your breath I love Jesus and I believe Jesus and I take him at his word so that settles it God said so and if you can get to the place where you love him it will cast out the fear that you have that he will keep his word oh that's so important for us to defend oh my if we love our wives and husbands and husbands love their wives so much so much if we love them so much we can trust them what about God we should know God will keep his word every time I appreciate the law of perfect love well I appreciate an amen that's what it is it's love love produces faith if we can't have faith if we can have confidence is because there's fear there and we need more love of God to cast out all fear praise the Lord amen all right you got your Bibles go to acts 23 I want to get to a spot a moment here we'll get to the st. Paul just in a moment I want to bring in just another thought out I preached this before not this story I want to bring another thought out how we we love God first then the revelation of faith will come okay so love God first then the revelation of the word got us to us and then we have faith right that's right that's how it happens love God have some all fear then thumbs which is the revelation of God's Word all right so I said x-23 11 we'll get there in just a moment now let me read this quote as before we read that brother Graham talked about the maniac in Oregon I was going to kill him someone said brother Branham was you scared I said no sir not a bit imagine having somebody that's a foot taller than you 200 more pounds than you saying I'm going to kill you and he said I wasn't scared one bit not as long as Jesus is there as long as he told me to do this and I'm in his widow there's nothing to fear as long as you're doing what he says to you and you know you're directly led well then there's nothing to fear perfect love casts out all fear there's no fear in God love takes away fear so I want to start with that so see God had already talked of the RAM to go to Oregon so when he's standing there at the pulpit he has to remember God already revealed to me that he sent me here so now I have nothing to fear praise God like my dad said a preacher she got the leadership of the Holy Spirit to go on missionary and go overseas he says when they put their feet on the new ground they can say I come here in the name of Jesus Christ and nothing's going to hinder me God sent me to Africa God sent me to Sri Lanka or God sent me to Ghana you know God sent me here my theater here and the name of Jesus Christ and nothing's going to hinder me do you understand that it's the revelation first you gotta have the revelation that faith only comes when we've already gotten love for God we can't have any sin in our hearts you got all the all the doubts cast down all the all the negativity all the strike all the complexes on the fear that's got to be all cast down by love and then the revelation of the word comes now let's go to acts 4 2311 here I'm gonna get there - after 2311 we might read a few scriptures around their acts 2311 i want you to bring out this quote because the prophet talks about this st. Paul 2311 now we're looking at red-letter words here so this is the Lord Jesus here speaking the st. Paul now let me give you the background of chapter 23 this was right before 200 Roman soldiers took Paul to Caesarea from Jerusalem he got a two hundred soldier Roman army escort that's how much God loves his prophets sorry he gave a lot at you to retreat but in this case he gave Paul a two hundred Roman centurion soldier escort from Jerusalem assess Surya because member there was forty men that had taken a vow said we're not gonna eat till we killed Paul remember that in Scripture they violated we're not gonna eat but then Paul was the nephew Paul's nephew heard I remember that and was nephew went and he told the leader told Paul about it and then also the the guards they found out he was a Roman citizen and so now Paul's waiting for this two hundred soldier escort and what concerts he loves God so much what comes the revelation comes he's in love with God so much that red letter revelation comes to him was completed verse 11 and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as now has testified of me in Jerusalem so thou must bear witness also at Rome and when it was day certain of the Jews band together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink - they kill Paul night remember that by God's grace he's all he's taking captive here Amen Jesus told in other words he said that you're going to Rome or Lydia you're going to Rome Jesus have told him and that were never found absolutely not where's the eye now he's in Jerusalem and Jesus tells them you're going to Rome hey man so in other words it's not saith the Lord I got a revelation I'm going to Rome let's take a loo say like this we need a revelation that we're going the rapture price neither undulation that we're going somewhere we need the redlener words we need goddess pay to enter into our soul to know that God is giving us his learning that his will prize glory amen now you know the story Paul gets shift assessor Rita he gets a two hundred Roman soldier guard escort these forty men can't kill Paul because he had a revelation I love Jesus and Jesus told me I'm going to Rome I don't care how many people come against you you've got a revelation crisis got to protect you all the fears cast out and love is going to protect you mate men got a race of sinners Romans uncircumcised ethan's god raises them over the government to protect his holy prophet amen why because he loved God and he all the love it casts on all the fear all had nothing to fear God will make a way amen boy on that red letters Jesus first sent policy Rome amen now if you would go to acts 28 now a lot of things happen between chapter 23 and 28 but others and a few of a memory goes to Jerusalem and they said well we can't judge him here he's for Roman citizen they send him on a boat remember the boat the ship that he wrote and they they all think oh you know if they're on it for two weeks and they'll think we're going to sink and we're gonna do all these things but Paul goes down to the bottom of the boat and he prays that the ancient Lord meets him there and said you're not gonna lose one man he said stay in the ship I remember that anyone who stays in the ships of the ship he stays the Bible said and so see Satan was trying to convince them that oh we're all going to lose our lives on the ship and Paul had the word of Lord now I've got to go to Rome and then the aged Lord told me that no one would lose their lives from this from this ship crews that were on or the ship up on a journey that were on and Satan tried to defeat that he tried to kill many but the men stayed on the ship and God's word was true don't you love what God's Word is truly it looks like it's not going to be true but God makes service where it comes to pass how they do you let's go to acts 28 first woman X 28 verse 1 now Paul he swims I think he's floating on a piece of wood if I'm not mistaken look at verse 28 sorry chapter xxi 1 and he they actually land on the island of Malita right they land on the island of Malita look at verse 1 and when they were escaped then they knew that the ayah was called Lolita and the barbarous people showed us no little kindness they were very kind for they kindled a fire and received us everyone because of the present rain and because of the cold he imagined God might give eternal life to these people just because they made a fire for God's prophet remember jesus said if you just give a drink of water you'll get a reward and here these barbarous heathen people are showing kindness that god's prophet law imagine honey would bless them tremendously look at verse 3 and when paul had gathered a bundle sticks now here's a prophet he just sat in a ship for two weeks church with very little food and water he just swam from a broken destroyed ship on him on a piece of wood all the way to the land he gets up here and while he keeps on working paul was a worker he didn't say i'm god's prophet you guys served me he goes out and gets wood for the fire he was a worker how many workers begotten here by God's grace oh the Bible says the greatest among you are the servants not those who are served but he said the greatest among you are servants so here Paul he's tired he's worn out he's not fed all the way but he still digs down deep and let the love of God move in his heart to go get some sticks and help with a fighter he's always find a way to help out a man but a servant of the Lord back glory and when Paul gathered a bundle sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat he just got through the trial of men wanting to kill him and then almost a sunken ship and now guys another God allows another trial to happen right after this you know what my man said the rest that the stronger you getting God the more trials you get and it doesn't make you weaker it's too perfect you is to make you a complete perfect Christian and you learn a constantine upon the Lord and lean upon his love and not our feelings and not our creases and our memory our punches that's what trials are for and Peter said they're more precious than gold any amount we can get in our bank accounts any mail we get our church treasurer cup any mail we can get in there the trials that God allows that are like actually more precious than all that filthy money what's it like that all that money they're more precious than gold the Bible says so he just got off this two-week almost starvation where people want to kill him but yet thus saith the LORD happens amen he goes on he keeps working and keeps bringing in sticks and I'm ready to reach this out and get them on the hand look over there said now this is I said all of that to get to this point inside man 1953 isn't about perfect love program said we think of the great st. Paul one-time landed on a certain island Malita the ship was wrecked God had promised him that he was going to make a certain destination Laurie here he is on the Leedom of God said you're not gonna stop and Malita you're going all the way to Rome praise the Lord he was going back to Rome and stand before Caesar and he believed God he believed God no matter who is happening on the ship no matter of two weeks of storms and almost starvation it doesn't matter God said I'm going to Rome and I love God so much I believe it's word amen and these current situations I'm not going to trust any of my thoughts or emotions I'm not gonna trust what I see with my five human senses jesus said I'm going to Rome and I love Jesus and I know he's gonna take me in her home but dad said so he was helping the man he had changed a runner my presser how put him in changed her putting the change he's got changed and he's picking up sticks can you imagine going over there he's got chains on and he's helping out and he lays his six hours and a Viper jumps out and sinks into and when he had thrown some wood down a great deadly beast serpent bit him right through the hand and the Beast was so deadly so if it been a person they usually drop dead within a minute or two and so the native said that man look his chains on him he's a prisoner he must be a murderer because he might has hit the storm but he's not gonna hit that serpent and he's gonna die so look what they thought they thought oh if he got bit by a snake and he said change he must be they're using their reasoning right well anyone that's a prisoner would be an evil person anyone remember what the jail would be an awful person and then all this snake bit him not open think it must be an awful person he's gonna die here's a Bob Anderson he said this he said a moment he said Paul looked and seen this the Viper he said there is not a speck of fear because Jesus said they take up serpents and it will not harm them he looked at that deathly bite no fear if you fear and Satan steps in Satan's fear but perfect love casts out all fear fear he said there you are Paul said I am God's man there hangs a serpent but there is not one speck of fear here or there see it's all in harmony they said why Paul aren't you too afraid you'll fall dead he said why certainly not I can't fall then the Holy Spirit's inside of me now the very holy spirit that made the heavens the earth had that man so charged with this power Oh glory till the death in that bag of the servant wouldn't even go into his body in man because his whole body was full of that spirit just as it's full of blood nidia beautiful dark rays of the Lord I hope you got that his body was so full of love let me go back to that here his body was so full of love his body used so called the Holy Ghost boy from his soul out to his mind that's the Holy Ghost anointing on him what is that the poison come into his body brother Branham said because he was stilled love amen he said that every little cell of blood is a light and there you are all charged full of the Holy Ghost why certainly they walked on water they've done great miracles why they were so perfectly in harmony with God that first church and Christian friends we got to get back to that it's a perfect love and confidence in God is just what brazen we may shout be buddy speak with tongues he made me break teachers of theology have DVDs hanging on it but it'll never work until this comes in harmony with God's love hey man is that beautiful this soldier this prophet went through all of these hard things and because he had love of God going out because he had revelation that he was going to Rome he didn't fear one bit he just threw the Viper in the fire Romero said he sent that devil right back to Hell where he came from hey Penn he didn't fear I got hit by serpent her Viper I'm gonna cast it down [Music] you
