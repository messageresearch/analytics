word of prayer let's remain standing here and we'll take quite a few prayer requests tonight there's a lot of needs um and as priests unto God we're happy to take them before the throne of grace knowing that God can give us help in this time of need here so let's uh read through some of our uh needs here tonight just a real quick announcement I sent out the text um service Saturday at 6: and then two on Sunday just because we don't see our brother uh Dennis too much but hopefully after this I can keep him returning he got the cheapest ticket I've ever seen in a long time so maybe that's a good sign to have him back again so but we're thankful for that but many numerous requests let's remember um brother uh amen said he heard brother Ben Rod say he's having eyesight trouble because of the diabetes so remember that situation um it's very serious so let's remember him also Naomi and Wesley in their their travel I believe is next Monday if I'm not mistaken so let's pray no Co for them and uh because if they get Co in some whatever part they have to quarantine for 14 days and then they got to pay for their own hotel so it just it'd be awful it'd be awful so let's pray for good test and then um Sound Health for them also Jose is still of course extremely uh sad because he lost his son in the tragic accident uh on Sunday and also let's remember his health in prayer but amen has requests that we can all grow in the Lord so I think that's a beautiful request by God's grace we'll keep feeding on the things of God like trees planted By the Waters we got to stay connected to the Holy Spirit right the power of God that's a great prayer Hallelujah also it's remember my cousin Adam's back I haven't heard update uh let's pray for David deweer the two-year-old boy his infections better he's out of intensive care but a mom still asked for prayer then we had a a child we had a friend uh named Eric who got in a really bad uh sledding accident uh I guess just need that I guess he's going to need some surgery I'm sorry need some stitches or something like that on his face so kind of hit something while he's sleding so let remembering him in prayer just just stitches probably or we don't know okay so lost some teeth because of sleding accd so let's remember that in prayer I'm ask God to be merciful uh also I think that's it by God's grace anybody else have any other needs they like to be remembered tonight okay let's uh let's you guys can stand here I'm oh you oh that's right you want to play during the that's fine prayer during the prayer request I'm sorry I didn't

these things Lord in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen God bless you let's take our Bibles here tonight thank you let's go to Luke Chapter 5 I'd like to just preach again on new wine in new bottles and just focus on the mind tonight you know we I think we preach really hard really long on the soul right the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what uh many times we refer it to but it has to be in the mind as well uh by God's grace so let's go to Luke Chapter 5 and we'll go to the end of the chapter there let's go to vers uh 36 Luke 536 [Music] so Luke 5:36 why don't I read um I'll read 36 and 37 we can all read 38 and 39 so I'll read 36 and 37 and he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the peace that was taken out of the new AG not with the old and no man putteth new wine into Old bottles else I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry I'm doing 307 my fault yeah and no man putteth new wine into Old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles Shall Perish let's all read 38 and 39 1 2 3 but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved no man also having drunk old wine great way desireth new for he saith the old is better may God has blessings through reading his word you may be seated praise God so I just want to um I want to make sure I set my timer here I'll set it for 30 minutes then I'll maybe close after that for 10 minutes or something like that we really want to be careful uh make sure our brother gets good rest and we really appreciate brother amen and sister who will com in tonight we appreciate that uh I've never worked third shift so you have a lot of Courage but amen and I really appreciate that buddy so thank you for your faithfulness and thank you sister for all you do to help him out we appreciate that love you both so let's uh let's preach this for about 30 minutes or so 35 minutes and uh I just want to follow up more on the mind um uh because we know the soul uh is what this is the main text is talking about so if you look at the scripture in verse 36 it's a you can't put a new piece of garment on a old garment right you don't put a a new one on an old one right and then with 30 seven you don't put new wine into an old bottle now brother brandom us this all the time you can't put God's revelation into a denomination that's right praise God because we've all seen it right you try to put when you witness right you try to put a new right God sent a prophet or did you know there's a new way to baptize as far as not your old denomination but it's the Bible Way right anytime you try to put a new revelation into an old Stony heart it bursts right they get upset they got mad I remember I had such good friends brother the Amen in uh um campus Focus you know I had such good friends my they I thought they were my closest friends I thought my they were the best people in the world but as soon as I shared serpent seed with them as soon as I shared water baptism and God was in a trinity Lord right the godhead that's thus say the Lord to put that new wine of thus say the Lord to try to put it in an old denominational bottle it bursts and both are wasted right yeah and that's why Jesus said cast not your Pearls Before Swine praise God Amen so see you got you got to be led in other words you gota be led of the Holy Spirit to do Outreach and and witnessing right you gotta we have to wait for the spirit to guide us in those things amen praise God the the thing is also we should be constantly praying for opportunities to do that praise God uh you know like for example I had a leading of the Lord to write the book and I'm glad I did because it's helped numerous people praise God uh and I'm I'm I'm feeling LED you know in different areas too with with with more missionary work I was telling my wife I was telling her that amen if the Lord should tar I want to do different missionary work just like Apostle Paul if the Lord will T because I have a burden and as long as I feel led to do it as long as we feel led to do it then we should pursue it and ask God to bless it praise God because we feel it's his leading to do it praise God right because if we didn't if we had our leading we would probably be lazy right and I can say Amen I'd probably be lazy amen I or i' I'd probably be selfish right or I we'd probably choose the easy way right because that's Humanity because that's what denominations many times do right uh because you try to put because when you try to put a new a new idea a new inspired thought in there if if they won't adjust if they won't adapt to that and have a new heart it'll burst right it'll go to not okay so I just want to bring that first thought out that brother Ram us this many times with denomination you can't put a new piece of cloth a new revelation into an old Creed praise God it'll burst it all up right and you can't put the Holy Ghost message in a denomination it'll burst praise God it won't it won't work right it'll people will get upset uh it'll it'll ruin it everything will be ruined so you've got to put God's word God's new word in a new heart praise God and that's what Ezekiel said I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and my spirit praise God do you remember what your old heart was like you'd argue against everything you oh this can't be right no way this can't be right and you didn't you know maybe you didn't you fought against God's revelation for a while praise God I know there's a couple times I I flip-flopped you know after I heard it I believed it for a while then I had a couple hard days a couple hard weeks where I'd flip-flop and I remember you bringing an arguments against it right uh because you can't you can't put a new thought in in a in an old heart it has to be a heart that feels fresh a heart that's full of Faith that's the kind of heart god pours out his holy spirit into praise God a heart that on fire a heart that loves God a heart that's open to more Revelation praise God that's who God pours it into praise God now I want to uh just Define wine real quick wine of course is alcoholic fermented juice of fresh grapes like beverage and it's it's also fermented juice of a plant product uh such as a fruit and it's something that invigorates or intoxicates right so wine invigorates people like brings it give them life right whereas they didn't seem very living beforehand but wine applied will invigorate someone right or it intoxicates now intoxicate means to excite or Stupify right to Stupify to Surprise by alcohol or a drug especially to the point where physical and mental control is markedly diminished praise God Amen so when someone isn't intoxicated they lose all their inhibitions they lose control of their old thinking and they act in a brand new way praise God Amen it also means to excite or elate to the point of enthusiasm or frenzy hallelujah praise God and church it's like we get a fresh drink every time we come to the house of God Amen so God's living water is actually living wine can I say it like that anytime you get re-excited or or uh you get stupified right or you get invigorated anytime you get excited or enthusiastic about God it's a fresh drink from Heaven praise God Amen and we know it's down to the soul right because that's what brother Ram says there was 120 new bottles that got filled with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost but anybody that studies their Bible long enough is going to realize there was Old Testament characters and New Testament characters that got discouraged but then God invigorated them right they got maybe uh discouraged but then they got encouraged and so we see the same idea the new wine needs to also be applied to our minds amen amen and I had a good one last night uh so to you know yesterday we had a snow day I don't know oh that's right you're you're she's at home right she's on remote so no snow day so we had a snow day right and I was so excited I couldn't I got up early I didn't even try to I just got at 4:30 to study and pray and read my Bible and everything and get work well by the end of the day I was exhausted and I was just discouraged I was like I wanted to get this done and I can't wait till we get our house renovated I can't wait till I get this book done and I was just so discouraged and I was like man I just want all this to get over with I just wanted and so I walk in there and Lydia's playing a song and there's a a preacher Shane and Shane he was talking at a concert and he said you know God said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall want continually more and more of everything I thought no that's not what he said and he basically rebuked himself for wanting more Christmas presents now this is the singer and I thought I thought that's just how I'm feeling right now I just want now it's good spiritual things but I wanted to get the house done I wanted to get uh the book done I want to get the YouTube video done I just wanted to get everything done I wanted wanted wanted but in that moment I was convicted and humbled and I had to realize the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I'll say it again the Lord is Our Shepherd we shall not what Amen in other words tonight Church you and I are not lacking anything we and I got to be careful too when I have my goals or my desires I have to be careful not to get caught up in too much into wanting them but trusting that the God if it's God's will God's Gonna accomplish it praise God Amen and at this moment right now I'm not lacking anything because God is the one who orders our steps praise God Amen I was just I was and I was so invigorated last night I was I was at first I was discouraged and after that I was like wow I feel so much better so I turned on the music I started singing that song the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me lie down in green pastur amen and church the peace of God invigorated me now you would think on a day off beatress I'd be so happy but you see how the devil works on me I get discouraged like oh you didn't get this and this is still not done and I get discouraged that way but I love how the peace of God passes all understanding amen and God's able to to meet our need and instead of me being discouraged God's able to encourage me right and God is able to show me that I have everything I need now think about this not only do we have everything we need naturally but in heaven we're already perfect amen you're already forgiven praise God you've already got a theop body that's Eternal in the heavens praise God you've already got an eternal home even if you left this home you got an eternal body waiting there for you praise God Amen of theany praise God you got to worry about the future right our future is already settled we got an eternal home a tabernacle that cannot end praise God we've got Eternal possession Eternal inheritance waiting for us in Heaven by the blood of Christ amen oh my and so I just you know it was kind of quickened to me yesterday like wow how often do we need new wine for our minds we need a freshh thought that was such a frh fresh thought I had not thought about it's Psalms 23 right I not thought about Psalms 23 for months and months and months all of a sudden I love how the faithful God brings you a word in due season so thank you L for playing that I don't know if I thanked you yesterday that really encouraged me I thought wow I don't I don't lack anything Devil's trying to discourage me oh you didn't get this done and all that but really I don't lack anything because I've got Jesus and church if I've got Jesus I've got everything praise God Amen now getting back here so you see what uh wine and intoxication means you lose the inhibitions right and we're going to focus on the spirit man because the soul is it's a one time only it's a one time only baptized with the Holy Ghost he never says you're re-baptized that's not even a word using the King James there's no such thing as a rebaptism right so your soul is sealed and then the Bible said you don't sin your your soul can't even sin right and Paul said it's I'm not the one that sins it's the sin that dwells within my body praise God and so I want to just look at the mind and just reiterate a few things about the mind now brother BR says brother BR says wine is stimulation he says shouts Joys shout and joy he calls it wine praise God and he said while he's preaching he said I can hear it right now right and so if people weren't born again right when he was preaching it then that means their minds were getting new wi right many of those people that were saying amen and were probably already born again in their soul in other words they already had the wine in the soul but they needed some wine in their minds amen amen that's right praise God that's why I keep going back to church all these years because I get filled up on wine all the time I get a fresh drink Glory praise God you would do right we do too that's why you come back praise God Amen because it's wine it's Joy it's it's fresh power amen it's wine ferments right and it bring it brings more power it gets more potent all the time I remember there's numerous times when we were growing up in Kyo Falls and Lydia and Malachi we used to buy apple juice right well sometimes apple juice would sit around and get kind of fermented I don't know if my wife remembers this or not so I'd pull out some of the apple juice and go to drink it kind of smells like it's wine right or grape juice ever had that I know what happened in college and maybe I'm mixing up my my early married life with my college life but I know in one of those lives that I lived the wife before the life before marriage and the life after I know in one of those lives either had grape juice that was fermenting and I drank it or apple juice that was fermented and I drank it and you can taste right away oh this is more powerful than the other right like when we have communion this is more powerful and so wine represents power amen represents power in this case not just in our soul because we have power in our soul right but then that now for us we need the new wine in the new mind we need new thought thoughts right to stimulate our minds so our minds don't break God's word we don't want to Old denominational mind yes we want a fresh Living Christian mind amen A A A Renewed mind the Bible calls it be renewed in the spirit of your mind the Bible Paul also calls it a transformed mind okay so these are the words here that we see now just remember the the the Mind recap the Bible says we must cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God so our job is to go around cleaning our mind and if we see something that we don't like to cast it down right we got to go cleaning you know when you guys came over for Thanksgiving I went around with the broom and I G to knock down all the spider webs right I what I had I had to cast them down now sometimes I like those spiders you know I just I don't want to kill them right it's like what they do to me they don't hurt me they don't bite me you know but in the case I have I was having people over I had to pull them down and knock them down and I had to cast it down right in order to clean up in order everything look nice and make it look beautiful and pretty you have to cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God praise God and so the Bible says you and I are in charge of going around our minds and pulling down anything that exalts itself against the word of God Amen so if you're discouraged may the Lord help us to pull it down TR the holy spirit will say when are you going to cast that down right and that's kind of what I had helped with last night so I thank the Lord for that when are you going to cast down your discouragement when are you gonna how long you going to let that uh that that Envy stay up there how long you let that jealousy how long you let that anger stay up there cast it down throw it down praise God just just get it off the shelf right that's the wrong thing we don't want on the Shelf there's good you can have questions on the Shelf but you don't want sins on the Shelf praise God so take it down and cast it down praise God that's all we got to do is just take it down and cast it down because remember the Bible said if you don't it will build up a strong hold or Castle in your mind and then every time you go to that area it's it's fighting against you right or it's fighting against God so you don't want to build that up you want to take it down and cast it down and throw it down praise God so just just reiterate that and I was thinking today Church uh when Jesus told the story remember he said it your mind is like a house he said in your house he said you you store and how many uh picture your pantry right now what do you got on Pantry I got I remember I got peanuts right here on one of the shelves I got pasta on this shelf what else I got in there oh I got some sauces I got some chips in there I'm making y'all hungry aren't I but the Bible says those are your goods how many know what I'm talking about Jesus says though he said you got to keep your house strong and you can't let somebody come in and take your Chips praise God or your peanuts unsalted of course right but Jesus says if you let somebody into your house they're going to spoil your house they're going to tie you up so they right they're going to tie up you so you can't stop them right they're going to discourage you or make you scared fearful and they're going to go over and take all your food right and spoil your house that's how Jesus Likens our minds unto we got to protect our stuff amen now usually I wouldn't fight over food but in this case we got to fight over the fruits of the spirit praise God Amen right in other words don't let Satan take your joy don't let Satan take your faith amen amen you got to be willing to fight for it don't let him spoil and Rob all of your things can you imagine if a stranger walked in and he just went over and took your peanuts and your chips and your salsa and just started eating and tied you up you wouldn't stand for that I mean if you had a bat or a broom You' start hitting the person right you beatric wouldn't let Naomi get all tied up she'd go beat the dude right stop you're not going to rob me and we should do the same thing to the devil cast him down don't let him Rob us of all of our blessings all the things God has given us all the things Jesus died for let's not let Satan steal them from us amen amen cast it down that's that's what all he says you have to do is cast on anything that Satan's trying to establish or in other words don't let him into your house keep them out and protect the good things God has blessed you with amen amen and this is what we're saying new wine new thoughts new fresh anointing inspiration in a new mind amen and that's what we have in our minds now I want to just re I just wanted to recap that now church I want to just share a story I meant to share on uh Sunday but I forgot because the mind is such an important thing it's it's where we fight our battles right once you're sealed with the Holy Ghost you are sealed to the day of redemption you don't have to worry about that anymore right you just got to feed it just got to feed the soul because he said my soul thirst is for you see the soul just wants more of God but the place we got to watch out for is our mind because that's the battlefield right but I want to share this a little story just two little stories real quick about Rejuvenation of the mind so new new wine in the new mind okay so I've known a couple pastors who had mental breakdowns I just want to tell a story of a pastor and a minister who had kind of like a mental breakdown okay so let me tell the pastor's story first a lovely Pastor man I I greatly admire well he became pastor and as you know uh they have a board of directors right like at our church It's banging me that's all we have so really I I really I can't get voted out right because there's only two votes well at at least got 50% but anyways so we might have to get another board member so rather pray about it because it probably shouldn't be too but anyways we just don't have many people that you know would like to anyways the pastor was pass him for years and years and then he found out on the board was many Old-Timers and some of them were deacons and one of the deacons wasn't even paying ties and so he knew the message oh if you don't pay ties you you can't serve in an office right like if you're robbing God how can you serve God at the house of God if you're robbing if you're robbing Heaven's bank right okay just so and just just to give you a background this brother was in a couple of brother Ram's meetings so let me build up the pressure the mental pressure that this pastor was under so a man who knew brother well he saw brother Bram I don't know if you ever met him and this was just a few years ago by the way so he had addressed that brother in a meeting and said you know he had all the deacons and Boards he said uh he talked to the brothers and said you know this guy he said you have to go you're not paying ties and so at the meeting they just disagreed no we disagree and so that brother who wasn't paying ties went out and told other people in the church that were big tithe payers and they started talking and they they were all against the pastor now this tells you what kind of a church condition that is what kind of a church has the Holy Ghost and will support people in Ministry in offices in leadership that can't even pay their tithes and yet he has a lot of money and then after the the Deacon went out told all that uh then then allthough there's some women in there then they all started putting pressure on the pre the pastor's wife just making comments here and there oh like you better not you better stop talking about it tell your husband not to put him off the Deacon board because remember a pastor has the power to do that brother man said a pastor can remove anybody from any office so the pressure got so built up over uh over months and months of this because then the then the you know pretty soon it gets out to everybody in the church everybody knows pretty soon the preacher had a mental breakdown alls he did for two or three days was just cry he couldn't even he couldn't even he couldn't even study couldn't even pray all because of the pressure oh these people are going to now look he had he had numerous kids they're they're paying his income he don't have any anywhere to go right and so he had this mental breakdown and yet we believe he was born again so three days and so you know how you know how he got back and got his Rejuvenation you know how I got his new wine he talked to his wife and his wife said honey you're doing what's right just do what's right stand up for the word of God stand on the word and so he did he got he he uh he stood there and said going to get him out but eventually had to resign because of it because they weren't going to budge and that tells you what and that's these are message churches right right so It ultimately came down to he was so discouraged his wife had to encourage him and and and help strengthen him and bring fresh thoughts and fresh Revelation and so it was really great you know he got to go to another church and they support him fulltime and and now he's uh elsewhere preaching and and still a pastor amen but can you imagine the pressure I'm going to my job uh Insurance all these things I thought God called me to preach I thought these people believe the message look what political pressure does to people see if we don't cast down those thoughts right I'm gon to lose my job uh which we I'm not making fun of him or anything like that I'm just saying we all we have to go through things like that right but the reality of it is no matter what the struggle is we need to take that doubt or that fear whatever it is and cast it down and stand upon God's word but thank God for faithful wies and husbands right hopefully let me say like this hopefully our husbands have encouraged our wives at some point because it seems like the wives do a lot of encouraging right God bless our sisters right right we so Brothers God help us to be a better encouragement to our lives amen I thought maybe I hear some sisters say Amen on that but that's a true story true story pressure in the message because of who you are not because of what you're doing because of who you are puts pressure right people are disobeying the word yet they still get it to serve in the church may it never be us brother sisters may it never be us may we always be honest and humble with the word of God and obey every word now the second one was a preacher uh was and God actually used me in this one a preacher was just having a slow season wasn't getting many invites to preach uh wasn't uh you know people had stopped uh you know asking for sermons and I come in I preach that message diligence and I said I said have you ever heard of compound prophecy if you invest like a $100 uh today and keep doing a $100 a month you'll have like a million dollars I think it was 30 years if you just do a hundred that's probably not the right number but that's the power of compound interest and I said if you want to be a successful preacher I L I guess I looked right at the brother I said if you want to be a successful preacher you got to invest today and invest tomorrow and invest the next next day and pretty soon your gift is going to grow and it's going to increase and after the service the brother came up to the Altar and he was weeping and crying saying I was just told myself this morning I'm ready to quit I'm done preaching so I had the pleasure of seeing the Holy Ghost restore brother praise God wow almost left the ministry right almost quit almost walked away just because of discouragement ah what what do you need Church a fresh drink of wine am amen he needed a new a new skin he needed a new thought process and then he needed some uh simulation to go in there praise God Amen that's in the mind right he needed rejuvenated the mind you needed invigorate like oh God can still use me amen I can still be a service I can do something for the Lord I'm not a failure praise God Amen so just two with ministers that I could remember as I Was preparing this message here and so Church uh I want you just to understand that that this applies also Al to the mind so God is in the power God is in the uh the business of restoring us from mental breakdowns I've never had one thank God but I'm not saying I'll never have one but God I've seen God restore people to it and God when we almost feel like we're going to quit and we and God knows we wouldn't want to right God comes in and he rescues us praise God he gives us fresh inspiration fresh Rejuvenation fresh Revelation amen Hallelujah now there's as I said there's many Bible examples so let's turn in our Bibles here let's go to Psalms Psalms 103 just a beautiful chapter here Psalms 103 and I just had four and five just to watch the time oh I'm almost at 30 minutes now my goodness oh boy Psalms 10 3 4 and 5 just want to I want to show you this too remember the Believers in the Old Testament could not be born again the soul so anytime they talk about restoration it's new wine in the mind right okay so verse four and five who redeemeth thy life from destruction see redeemed your life was going to be destroyed but God brought you out of it who crowned you with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles praise God so God was able to renew Believers in the Old Testament they felt old they felt tired they felt almost dead and God said you're not I'm bringing you back to life amen God made them New Again God renewed their strength Like an Eagle praise God Amen God specialized in that Proverbs 3 ver8 let's read that Proverbs 3 ver8 so see it's new wine it's new power whereas we're told now I've never seen it scientifically Pro but we're told Eagles Can't Fly for a while they get discouraged maybe their eyes film over uh I've never seen it myself but it's in the Bible so it must happen to Eagles right but somehow they can't fly they can't see real well they can't hardly eat but somehow they break out of it and they can soar back up to where they were they look totally different their strength is renewed life is re renewed they got renewed Vision renewed hope renewed Faith praise God everything's new praise God Amen and the Bible said we can have it too renewals Proverbs 38 it shall be Health to thy Naval and Marrow to thy bones uh go to verse nine maybe that's what I was looking for no go back to seven must been seven 37 oh yeah I'm sorry yeah that's it right there I'm sorry 10 thank you hun ah you're on it sharp as attack so shall thy barns be filled with plenty so in other words when you're sick or you're discouraged God will restore you when you're empty God will fill you and thy presses shall burst out with new wine praise God in other words you have a fresh crop right you have a fresh harvest season you stomp out the grapes they come pouring out you let them ferment and it's fresh wine praise God Amen see God is the master of this God is the master of bringing people out of hardship and restoring them to Victory amen he's the master of it praise God so there you see let's go to job since we're here job 33 now remember alahu is a young man who rebukes job he's just a young man but he rebukes him anyway right before Psalms job 33 so you know in verse in chapter 32 elu kind of has to he has to kind of say well he said I'm a young man in verse six he said I'm I'm young you're very old wherefore I was afraid and dur not show you mine opinion uh but look at verse eight but there's a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding amen so you see he was afraid that was uh job 32 I'm sorry that job 326 and 8 there's my 30 minutes so let me set another timer to be 40 that's crazy right so he said I was afraid to talk to this older man until the spirit of God Came Upon me and then when the spirit of God Came Upon me I understood what to say so I was fearful fearful fearful I didn't understand I didn't know didn't I was scared scared and all of a sudden ah now I know that's new wine praise God that that's a fresh Revelation praise God it's a fresh start it's renewed strength praise God now look what he says in 33 now it's to 33 now this is a beautiful chapter about dreams and how God speaks through dreams uh go to uh verse 22 33:22 y his soul draweth near into the grave and his life to the Destroyers if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto man his uprightness then he is gracious unto him and say deliver him from going down to the pit I have found a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than a child's he shall return to the days of his youth he shall pray unto God and he will be favorable unto him and he shall see his face with joy he will Render unto man his righteousness so El was saying just stay with God if you're old and discouraged he said God is going to restore your strength praise God he's gonna make your in job's case he literally made his skin like a new baby praise God right He restored his health and haven't we seen that with your father-in-law haven't we seen that it's like he was in the the very depths of perishing right the very depths and now he's he's up and so busy all the time right he just it just that that's God God's a restore of life amen he makes things new praise God he feels like he's young again praise God he returns to the days of his youth praise God Amen go to Jeremiah 20 Jeremiah 20 let's look at God restore Jeremiah Jeremiah in this chapter has been he's already been prophesied he's already been spit on he's been slapped across the face uh verse one 20 verse one now pure the son of emmer the priest who was also chief governor of the house of the Lord heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things then pasture smoked Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the High Gate of the Benjamin which was by the house of the Lord and it came to pass in the tomorrow that pasture brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks then Jeremiah said unto him the Lord hath not called thy name pure but magor missabib now that means Terror on every side so he said you're not pure you're a terror on every side you're not a man of Peace you're a man of Terror okay what a rebuke he just got out of the prison right you think he has something nice to say he don't have something nice to say he's bringing correction to this evil man now go down to verse uh uh we'll just go to verse eight for since I spake I cried out and cried violence and spoil because the word Lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily so every day the more Jeremiah preached the more he was persecuted the more he preached the more he was made fun of the more he preached the more he got punched or slapped or put in prison and he was about ready to quit right verse nine then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak any more his name but his word was in Mine Heart as a burning fire shut up in my bone bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay praise God so he was he's like I'm I'm this is like the one we the testimony we heard earlier I'm done preaching I'm done with struggles I'm done uh fighting against people I don't want to fight anymore and all of a sudden the real fighter rose up inside of him amen amen when you think you're done you just wait the real fighter is gonna rise up in you praise God Amen he said I'm done I've had enough of this this is too to be a Christian oh well there were you right but for us it's too hard to be a message believer it's too hard to deal with this and all of a sudden God said I won't let you quit I'm going to start a new fire in you a new fire new wine new invigoration praise God new enthusiasm praise God to keep going he ends up preaching what 24 more chapters or something like that I think it's Jeremiah 49 it goes up to boy he wasn't done even halfway praise God and this fire came up inside of him let me just see there it's 40 uh no it's 50 50 he was even halfway done see and church that's if you really love God you don't want to quit either do you that's my prayer if I ever quit God then you ra you have my permission to slap me aside you have you my permission to send a fire inside of me and get me to wake up praise God there one thing that's going to wake you up is fire remember brother tried to he tried to baptize the turtle he tried to tickle the turtle he said but I want when he put fire to the turtle the turtle move praise God because fire will make you move the Holy Ghost and Fire will give you strength it'll invigorate you it'll give you new power praise God because that's what it is power amen amen hallelujah A sound mind right the God has not giv us a spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind praise God Amen if you like quit well pray for God to give you some fire praise God or wait around and God will put a fire in you because if if you really don't want to quit you're not going to be able to quit if God's got work for you to do and you're not done yet he's going to put fire in you praise God now I better finish up here I got four more minutes on my 40 I got four minutes on my 40 can you believe that um now New Testament people went through many hardships right uh Peter cursed Jesus or I'm sorry cursed that he didn't know Jesus he didn't curse Jesus he cursed and said he didn't know Jesus but what does God do God restores his life praise God am God uh and Jesus comes to him himself and says do you love me he said go feed my sheep Now isn't that love you feel like you know so he quit preaching he went back out to fish and then Jesus said no you're not going to fish you're G to go feed my sheep right so he gives him he said how could I be a preacher I denied my Lord and Jesus said everybody makes mistakes I I said like this everybody makes mistakes you make mistakes I make mistakes we all make mistakes but God doesn't want you to quit praise God Amen amen amen a preacher who seen miracles for three years denies the very one who gave him power to make Miracles and Jesus doesn't cast them aside Jesus says go feed my sheep Noti go preach the word of God Amen see your testimony is more powerful as you go through your struggles right Bud see our testimony is only going to get more powerful as we overcome the battles praise God Amen but it was for Peter it's that way for us too and I wonder if he got new wine yeah he got new wine he said this is not the wine you're talking about it's the wine Joel talked about praise God now so so part of this many times part of getting new wine is repenting right when you when you and I really repent and church as a preacher and as a Christian many times I know if people really are repenting when they come to the altar right you can feel it many times you can feel it but here Paul defines what real repentance looks like so go to 2 Corinthians 7 he said this is what new wine really looks like 2 Corinthians 7 now this is right after casting down imagination I'm sorry no that that's chapter 10 I'm sorry I'm in the wrong chapter chapter 7 2 Corinthians 7 now Paul he says he gives them he made them sorrowful with Godly sorrow to repentance that's verse n and verse 10 for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death now here is ver for behold the self-same thing that you sorrowed after a Godly sord what carefulness it wrought in you yay what clearing of yourselves yay what indignation yay What Fear yay what vem desire yay what Zeal yay what revenge in all things you have to prove yourselves to be clear in this matter and the church said when you really when you and I really get a drink of wine we're more zealous and we're we're where we have a mind of Revenge we're not going to go back to that trouble we're not going to go back to that Temptation I'm gonna overcome that I'm no longer I'm gonna have a real fear for God I I know God is near I know his presence is here and I'm not going to sit against God am this is what real wine produces it produces a I'm carefulness right I'm going to clear myself I'll never do that again they'll never catch me doing that again I'll never catch myself doing it again because I've sorrowed after a Godly sore I've got in touch with God's heart amen I'm I'm grieved for my sins and I'll never go back because I've had a drink of new wine amen amen now Church how could Paul write this because he'd been through it right can he write about something he doesn't know no he he had some Revelation from God this is what what you produce see when you repent when we really repent this is what it should produce a new Strength right I'm not giving up it's been a long time it's been a long time since I've been discouraged about our church because God has done so many great things amen but before we moved here I was discouraged many times so like this is like a brand new start for me this whole church it's a blessing and all the people are the bigger blessing though but anyways there was so many times I was going to quit you know or I felt like quitting but each time God would send this little encouragement or somebody would get baptize or somebody you there'd be just enough encouragement to keep going and and and and then I would feel ashamed of myself after God would do that and I would have to and I and I would have a brand new desire I remember right this is a different thing I remember I stopped writing that modesty book a few years ago I stopped and John Graham come to me one day uh we were at a Giant Eagle he's like so are you done with that book I'm like no I said I stopped but just that morning I prayed and decided I was going to I'm going to finish that book I'm gonna finish that book and so when John said that I said oh brother that's two witnesses I had a witness this morning I need to finish it and he said yeah he said you need to finish it and so I went on a tear after that praise God and so I I I was more motivated praise God I had a fresh start I could look at the paper and it was fresh to me praise God because that's the most recent time I felt like I've had like a renewal praise God so I've been trying to go on this same power for a long time by the grace of God now in closing there's a lot of things I could say uh but in closing let's go to uh 1st Samuel 30 let's go to Let's close with David this such a beautiful text and I I will close here we got 20 minutes for amen till 8 o'clock so uh first Samuel 30 now if you know the story David's not King he's not even King in Hebron yet this is before Saul died he's he's in the process still of running from Saul Psalms 30 I'm sorry 1 Samuel 30 sorry this is right after church he was with the Philistines you know that David went and was with the Philistines running from Saul that's how that's how scared he was of Saul which any mortal man would be right and then he sa he was going to go fight against Israel in chapter 29 but God was merciful and God brought him out of fighting against God's Own people talk about Grace talk about Grace now you know this is ziklag chapter 30 1st Samuel 30 and it came to pass when David and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and ziklag and smitten and ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives can you imagine if we came to church one day and just the adults came back maybe we left somebody in charge of the kids and everybody was gone right just just a few people were left where's everybody at they were taken away verse four and then DAV and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep now before we read on ask yourself should they have wept or not should they have wept or not ask yourself that go to verse five and David's two wies were taken captives a hno and jez the jezus and Abigail the wife of nabal the camelite or carite look at verse six and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him can you imagine coming into a church and everybody wants to Stone the preacher I've seen a few mean faces but nothing that bad I've seen a few angry people I've had people walk out not really here but other churches when I've been the guest preacher they'll just walk out they don't like what I'm preaching but I've never had anybody with stones about ready to Stone me now remember he's he's only anointed he's not King yet he's just anointed king he's just potential King because the soul of all the people is grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God praise the Lord church talk about new wine right just a few hours earlier he's crying and saying oh all hope is God everybody wants to kill me right all hope is love Lo what is there to live for my children my wife everyone's gone the whole church is gone right and these guys want to kill me and the only place he found new wi was in the presence of God all by himself praise God Amen the Bible said be still and know that I'm God I imagine David experienced that on this day praise God because nobody else encouraged him Church there's going to be some times where nobody else can encourage you except your time with God because nobody else did there's going to be times I can't encourage you brother amen but God will praise God Amen there's going to be times you want to encourage me and it just don't seem like I catch it what I need is to encourage myself in other words get in the presence of God and God will raise my faith amen amen see there's times where you won't be able to help people you can point them to it but they've got to get in God's presence the themselves they got to get in his presence and they got to receive the new wine themselves but then remember there was times in the New Testament where Paul said Titus my son has refreshed me right he was in prison he was all and then uh the prison guards let him have some fellowship with Titus and he's like oh I'm so refreshed there will be some times where God will refresh you there will be a time a brother or sister will give you a word in due season how special it is the Bible says but there's other times where there's going to be nobody around and you've got to go before God and you've got to get encouraged and you've got to get some wine from God yourself praise God and like look at this once he's encouraged look what he does verse seven and David said to abathar the priest himik son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod that was the yman Thum so first he's crying like it's all hopes gone then people want to kill him and then he gets in the presence of God God encourages him God gives him new wine he's rejuvenated he says somebody get me that Bible amen somebody give me a Bible and and I want to speak to the word and I want to see the word speak back praise God Amen somebody give me a Bible so I can find direction for my life I want God's word to speak see once you're encouraged you'll go to the right place for for the word of God Amen may God encourage us so we go to the word for encouragement and not to our phones and not to the grandma and not to somebody that's going to tear us down but go to the word of God Amen you go somebody bring me an ephod somebody bring me a word a word of the Lord praise God and then he inquired in verse eight to the Lord and said shall I pursue him and he said shall I overtake them he answered pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all let's stand to our feet let's stop there by God's grace so we got 15 minutes and we still need to sing and praise the Lord and see if anybody needs special prayer tonight how many love Jesus tonight amen church I'm so grateful for the new wine in the new skins of our mind praise God David knew what it was like like Jeremiah knew what it was like job knew what it was like David knew what it was like Solomon knew what knew what it was like Paul knew what it was like Christians at Corinth Corinth they all knew what it was like whether it was through their own mistakes and they repented and they got this new Zeal and new strength or if they're or if they're just discouraged and it wasn't their fault right it wasn't David's fault or maybe God just allows some some trial to come upon you and then you get in God's presence and God restores your soul musicians you can come by God's grace This Is Our God our God gives new Strength Our God gives new power and let's pray for that as we close let's pray for more power praise God let's pray for more faith let's pray for encouragement praise God we don't want to we don't want Satan to attack things in in our homes that's going to defile our homes and put things on the Shelf we want to C down all of his lies amen we don't want him to defile things in the church and we don't want to to defile things in our house we need to cast those down and be ready to obey the word of God and say God give me some new Strength give me some new wine praise God am amen let's pray together Heavenly Father
