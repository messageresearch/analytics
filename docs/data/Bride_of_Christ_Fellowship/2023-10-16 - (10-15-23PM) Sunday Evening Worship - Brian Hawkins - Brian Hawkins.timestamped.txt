[0:02] amen amen praise the Lord you know it's
[0:05] just by the by the grace that he has for
[0:08] us oh my it's good to see people
[0:10] worshiping oh I just love it and no I
[0:13] didn't know that a testimony was given
[0:15] but sister Emma just told me when we
[0:17] were leaving the restaurant that it's
[0:18] been since since March or somewhere
[0:21] around there since she's since the since
[0:24] the devil even tried to dare to bother
[0:26] her with a with a seizure and I thank
[0:28] God for that wow what a mighty God we
[0:31] serve amen praise the
[0:35] Lord and you
[0:39] know the you know a lot of times is I'm
[0:44] done thank you uh there's a lot of
[0:47] people want to say uh pray for my my
[0:51] situation of this pray for pray for the
[0:53] disease that I have they call it their
[0:55] disease well it's not their disease amen
[0:58] so that's the first thing is you got to
[0:59] deny that that it's even yours
[1:03] so I just had to tell her this is your
[1:07] freedom it's not your disease but it's
[1:09] your freedom that's exactly where it
[1:11] lies so I thank God for that wow I just
[1:13] love to hear testimonies you know people
[1:15] testifying of of God's goodness uh just
[1:19] going to get into the word this evening
[1:21] if you would uh turn with me to First
[1:23] Corinthians chapter
[1:25] 12 I was kind of tossed on on on a
[1:28] couple subjects and just felt uh felt
[1:32] led to go this this
[1:36] direction and pardon me one moment I
[1:38] forgot my
[1:49] water 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and verse
[1:55] 4 it says now there are diversities of
[1:58] gifts but the Same Spirit
[2:01] spirit and there are differences of
[2:04] administrations but the same lord and
[2:07] there are diversities of operations but
[2:09] it is the same God which worketh all in
[2:13] all but the manifestation of the spirit
[2:16] is given to every man to profit with all
[2:18] for to one is given by the
[2:21] Spirit by the spirit of the word of
[2:23] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[2:27] by The Same Spirit to another Faith by
[2:30] The Same Spirit to another the gifts of
[2:33] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[2:37] the working of Miracles to another
[2:40] prophecy to another Discerning of
[2:43] spirits to another diverse kinds of
[2:46] tongues to another the interpretation of
[2:49] tongues but all these worketh that
[2:52] one and the selfs Same Spirit dividing
[2:56] to every man severly as he will also
[2:59] turn with me to James chapter
[3:05] 4 and verse
[3:09] 15 and this is something that we that we
[3:11] should know because when we say well I'm
[3:13] going to do this I'm G to do that uh my
[3:16] my children have been doing that lately
[3:18] well I'm going to do this well how about
[3:19] if you ask
[3:21] first you know they they kind of uh
[3:23] forget the step they're just so
[3:25] comfortable with Mommy and Daddy and uh
[3:27] they just come hey we're going to go do
[3:29] this
[3:30] but first what don't you ask so James
[3:33] 4:15 it says for that ye ought to say if
[3:36] the Lord will we shall live and do this
[3:39] or that but now ye rejoice in your
[3:42] boastings all such rejoicing is
[3:46] evil therefore to him that knoweth to do
[3:50] good and doeth it not to him it is sin
[3:55] let's look to the Lord in prayer
[3:57] Heavenly Father we just thank you for
[3:59] the day that you you've given us that we
[4:00] continue in Lord that you've given us
[4:02] Grace to to continue uh to a second
[4:04] service and Lord it's the same as the
[4:06] first and any time that we come and
[4:08] Minister lord I can't do it without you
[4:10] I just pray that you just come and take
[4:12] over my body my spirit and just let your
[4:14] let your spirit come and take control
[4:16] father Lord just pray that the words
[4:18] that would come from my mouth would
[4:19] would be yours and that it would Bless
[4:21] the people Lord we ask it all in the
[4:23] name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you
[4:26] may be
[4:28] seated
[4:31] okay so we so we read that
[4:33] scripture and we went through the the
[4:36] operations of of the different gifts now
[4:40] what uh what I'd like to speak on is
[4:43] Discerning what is good and what is
[4:46] evil if if you pay if you notice in the
[4:49] in the uh
[4:51] scripture uh I lost it uh verse 10 1
[4:56] Corinthians 12 and verse 10 it says to
[4:59] another the working of Miracles we we we
[5:01] know that there's uh people that could
[5:03] work miracles we know brother brandham
[5:05] did it there are other people that are
[5:06] able to do it to another one uh to
[5:09] prophesy uh or to prophecy uh to another
[5:13] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[5:16] kind of tongues to another
[5:18] interpretation of tongues but the one
[5:20] that I would I uh want to concentrate on
[5:22] is the Discerning of spirits there are
[5:24] some that have a a gift of discernment
[5:27] that can uh like brother Bram had in the
[5:29] prayer line when he uh when people would
[5:31] come forth uh he would break out in
[5:34] discernment he would have a vision that
[5:36] that's a gift of discerning okay that's
[5:38] a gift of discernment but uh to all of
[5:41] us we should have some level of
[5:43] discernment of spirits uh not that we
[5:46] have the the gift to go to different
[5:48] different churches and say hey I have
[5:50] the gift of discerning but we should
[5:52] have at least a minimal amount of of
[5:54] discernment in our lives uh so uh
[5:59] talking to people in the past you know
[6:01] about different things about uh you know
[6:03] things of what what are good what are
[6:06] bad things that they shouldn't do
[6:07] talking about smoking you shouldn't be
[6:08] smoking you shouldn't be chewing tobacco
[6:10] you shouldn't be drinking well who says
[6:12] who says that that's bad who who Who's
[6:15] to say what is good and what is evil uh
[6:18] so what is good and evil uh it's our
[6:22] morals uh like the tree of knowledge of
[6:24] Good and Evil that's that's pretty much
[6:27] talking about our morals and the way uh
[6:29] that we conduct Our Lives what is right
[6:31] and what is wrong so uh some say uh the
[6:35] good and evil it's our or discernment uh
[6:38] it's our moral compass that guides us
[6:40] our our morals are our uh our compass
[6:43] that guides us uh so sometimes our
[6:46] question are some people's Compass are
[6:48] those compasses broken because it seems
[6:50] like it doesn't work uh like brother uh
[6:53] amen and I were talking on the way back
[6:54] you know people that saying that they're
[6:56] they're Christians or whatever why you
[6:58] drinking why you smoke why you you doing
[6:59] all these things and it and it appears
[7:01] that they're just
[7:03] uh make Believers I I guess you could
[7:06] say or or uh Hypocrites and and Lord be
[7:09] it far from us that any of us would be a
[7:10] hypocrite right for we don't want to do
[7:12] that uh we don't we don't want to have
[7:14] that kind of a heart we don't want to
[7:15] have that kind of a life that we would
[7:16] live a life of a hypocrite do we have
[7:18] bumps do we have valleys and mountains
[7:21] yes we do but that doesn't mean that we
[7:23] are a hypocrite because we try to live
[7:25] the best that we can we try to live the
[7:27] truth sometimes we fall and that's just
[7:29] the way way things are because uh I I've
[7:32] I've heard people uh with the struggle
[7:34] why can't I do good all the time it's
[7:36] because we're stuck in this flesh all
[7:38] the time so this this is our greatest
[7:40] enemy right here is every time you look
[7:42] in the mirror you're looking at your
[7:44] greatest enemy not not that you're foes
[7:46] with one another but it's a constant War
[7:48] of the spirit and the flesh it it's
[7:50] constant because the inside man wants to
[7:52] do right but the outside man you know uh
[7:55] might be tempted in Sugar which which we
[7:57] know that Sugar isn't really good for
[7:59] the body body and uh so I'm I'm sure the
[8:02] Smith family goes through all that
[8:05] stuff so sugar is not good for us so are
[8:09] we are we uh uh oh what's the word that
[8:13] I'm looking for are we uh defiling our
[8:16] body because we're putting sugar some
[8:18] people would say yes some people would
[8:20] say no I like sugar it's not a
[8:22] defilement a defilement would be on the
[8:24] the inside not so much uh the Inside Man
[8:26] spiritual not so much the Inside Man uh
[8:29] natural but it does have an effect on
[8:31] your body different things that you eat
[8:33] and different things that you partake of
[8:35] have different effects on our bodies so
[8:38] what I want to ask is are we okay with
[8:41] letting down the
[8:42] bars so when when we see that we're
[8:45] getting getting uh a little easy or or
[8:48] complacent that we might say and then we
[8:50] then all of a sudden we realize hey wait
[8:52] a second I shouldn't be doing this you
[8:54] know six months ago I thought this was
[8:55] wrong but why all of a sudden am I
[8:57] thinking that it's okay to do you know
[9:00] uh why am I watching I love Susie when I
[9:02] didn't I didn't like such and such you
[9:04] know uh that was not as bad as as as uh
[9:07] I Love Lucy and things like that so uh
[9:10] where where is it that we draw the lines
[9:13] of our good and
[9:15] evil so who determines what is good and
[9:18] what is bad uh ultimately God in the
[9:22] beginning he he pretty much laid out
[9:24] everything you know uh in in Genesis and
[9:27] then he had the the law and uh uh Exodus
[9:30] Numbers Deuteronomy different things uh
[9:33] all through there uh through the
[9:35] levitical priesthood uh they had all the
[9:37] different laws and that's how they were
[9:38] to manage the people that they had to uh
[9:42] the Lord had to establish some kind of
[9:44] laws he had to or or or it would be
[9:46] Anarchy if you have a place of Anarchy
[9:48] well nobody's in charge there are no no
[9:50] rules or everybody for himself but what
[9:54] what happens when when somebody has
[9:56] Pride somebody gets greedy and then they
[9:57] start attacking other people people
[10:00] where do you draw the line for a law or
[10:02] a rule or just let everybody uh Run free
[10:05] you know as a man thinketh in his heart
[10:07] so is he so what what's on in in a man's
[10:10] heart that's what he's going to perform
[10:12] you know and and most times uh in a
[10:15] man's heart it's is full of wickedness
[10:17] it's full of evil because that's that's
[10:19] just the nature of or that's just the
[10:21] human nature uh it even even most times
[10:25] uh as we uh as we live you could tell if
[10:28] some something is wrong or if it's right
[10:31] just by the way that you feel after
[10:33] doing the action you
[10:36] know I took such and such as candy bar
[10:38] that that probably wasn't the right
[10:39] thing to do maybe I ought to give it
[10:41] back well and like zakus maybe do it two
[10:43] or three fourfold or whatever you
[10:46] know you didn't get to see the picture
[10:48] but my wife got me this whole tree of
[10:50] candy
[10:52] bars there were 27 candy bars on that
[10:55] and brother brother a how are you going
[10:56] to eat all those I'm not
[11:00] I'm going to
[11:01] share
[11:03] but you know obviously we know like we
[11:06] were talking this morning not everybody
[11:08] agrees with our views not everybody sees
[11:10] uh the way that we see not everybody
[11:13] believes in the way that we that we
[11:15] believe you know some people think lying
[11:17] is okay we don't think lying is okay we
[11:19] think lying is a bad thing to do because
[11:22] it it's it's dishonest and we don't want
[11:25] to be dishonest we want to be honest
[11:27] people we want to be that uh that vessel
[11:29] of Honor that's that's my desire that I
[11:32] I I believe it's your desire as well
[11:33] that we are the vessel of Honor we don't
[11:35] want to be a vessel of Dison uh most
[11:39] people think that it's wrong to kill we
[11:41] know uh one of the Ten Commandments is
[11:43] Thou shalt not kill but some people you
[11:45] know there are psychopaths out there
[11:47] sociopaths whatever you want to call
[11:49] them uh they they think they're doing
[11:51] the world a favor by you know serial
[11:53] killers they think that they're doing
[11:54] the world of favor by ridding something
[11:57] else evil you know but that that's not
[11:59] the way that we operate you know we
[12:01] don't do one evil thing to eliminate
[12:03] another evil thing because all in all
[12:05] it's evil you know
[12:09] uh so if you look at the the abortion uh
[12:13] argument you know some people think that
[12:15] it's okay to kill a baby they don't look
[12:17] at it as killing a baby they just see uh
[12:20] I I can't even think of their argument
[12:21] they're they're just killing a a lump of
[12:23] cells while me on the other hand I'm
[12:26] horrified by even the thought of of
[12:29] abortion because it's taking an innocent
[12:31] baby's life uh whether you think it's a
[12:33] lump of cells or not it's still alive
[12:36] it's still alive clump of cells but what
[12:39] the you're destroying the potential now
[12:42] if you take those same people and you
[12:44] and you sit them down if you block every
[12:46] Avenue of their potential in life they
[12:49] would get pretty upset so how is it that
[12:52] they can move freely sorry I I don't
[12:54] mean to get on the abortion thing but I
[12:56] can't help it uh but how is it that they
[12:59] could move so freely everything is so
[13:02] selfish and that's where it lies is is
[13:04] self-
[13:06] gratitude well if I don't if I don't
[13:08] abort this baby just think of what I'm
[13:10] going to look like after the delivery so
[13:13] what you know it it's not about that
[13:15] it's about you being responsible you you
[13:18] were the one who was the grownup enough
[13:20] to do what you did to get in that
[13:22] predicament now be grown up enough to
[13:24] get out of it by continuing on see uh
[13:28] what you reap is what you sow so or what
[13:31] you seow is what you'll reap you you
[13:33] know what I mean so uh just the way our
[13:36] our actions every action that we do has
[13:39] some kind of a consequence there's going
[13:41] to be some kind of a reaction something
[13:44] else has to take place so I I can't I
[13:47] can't see the abortion uh argument as
[13:50] being something good all I can see is
[13:52] that it's all evil because it's taking
[13:54] an innocent life I didn't mean to spend
[13:56] so much time on that but uh
[14:00] continuing on see uh rules were not
[14:02] really uh put into place except it came
[14:06] through a covenant right uh uh or unless
[14:10] it was specifically spoken by God so uh
[14:14] in the beginning we didn't uh you know
[14:16] Adam and Eve didn't really have any
[14:17] rules except two rules you could eat of
[14:20] the one tree but don't eat of the other
[14:22] tree that's that's as far as we know of
[14:25] what of what the the rules were okay so
[14:29] and we know Adam and Eve that disob
[14:31] disobeyed which was a punishable uh
[14:34] effect right uh it was a it was a
[14:37] punishable action for what they did
[14:38] because they they went against what they
[14:40] were told not to do so therefore a
[14:44] punishment came see even the serpent
[14:46] they were both cursed right so why
[14:48] wasn't Adam cursed if you notice Adam
[14:50] wasn't the one cursed but the ground was
[14:52] cursed see Adam was an image of God that
[14:55] was made God couldn't curse himself
[14:57] right so
[14:59] uh so we find out with Cain and Abel uh
[15:02] when they're born and with their actions
[15:04] when they uh as far as we know nothing
[15:07] nothing in scripture says Cain and Abel
[15:10] uh you need to uh bring a sacrifice we
[15:13] we don't know that we don't know how the
[15:15] instructions were given but uh there was
[15:17] a time that they uh felt that they
[15:19] needed to bring a sacrifice and we know
[15:21] Cain brought a a a sacrifice of the
[15:24] ground you know something from the
[15:25] garden different things might have been
[15:26] pumpkins might have been artichokes who
[15:28] knows know what it was but he brought a
[15:30] a a sacrifice from the ground where Abel
[15:33] brought a blood sacrifice see there was
[15:36] a revelation there but we don't know uh
[15:39] we don't know the instructions that was
[15:40] given to either one of them maybe it was
[15:41] on the inside of them you know because
[15:43] the Holy Spirit you know that's how the
[15:45] scriptures that's how prophecy is done
[15:48] right so uh everything by inspiration by
[15:51] the moving of the Holy Spirit by the
[15:53] moving of God right
[15:55] so so when it came to it there was no
[15:58] rules set that when uh Abel did well
[16:02] because God laid it out there look Cain
[16:04] if you do like like Abel did you know
[16:07] all thing will be all things will be
[16:09] well you know if you do according to
[16:11] Abel because that's what I'm pleased
[16:12] with but if you don't do according to
[16:14] what Abel did then sin lith at the door
[16:17] and that's the first place where we
[16:19] where we learn what sin is right so
[16:23] uh and then we find out that Cain slew
[16:26] Abel there was nothing said beforeand
[16:28] hey you shouldn't kill one another you
[16:30] know that's not a right thing to do but
[16:32] uh but that was also a punishable
[16:36] offense again we don't know exactly what
[16:39] the the uh the ground ground rules were
[16:43] in the beginning so how did how did God
[16:47] know that that Cain slew Abel uh we we
[16:50] know that through the scripture where he
[16:52] says he uh that he heard the voice of
[16:54] Abel's blood crying from the
[16:57] ground
[16:59] but see even after that
[17:02] uh God was saying that Cain you're going
[17:04] to be punished for what you're doing and
[17:06] he laid out the punishment and then Cain
[17:08] whin and cried and said hey this
[17:09] punishment is way too much for me to
[17:11] bear so then he so God laid out the
[17:13] stipulation any man that kills
[17:15] Cain that's going to be punishable as
[17:18] well but leave him alone
[17:21] so God made the God made the decree uh
[17:25] to not kill him for his wrongdoing so
[17:28] there was there was no capital
[17:29] punishment laid down so so what is
[17:34] good you know the the the age-old
[17:37] question what is good well things that
[17:39] are this is you might think this is a
[17:41] Sunday school answer uh but God works in
[17:44] simplicity so what is good things that
[17:46] are of God Philippians chapter 4 verse
[17:51] 7 it says and the peace of God which
[17:55] passeth all understanding shall keep
[17:57] your hearts and Minds
[17:59] uh through Christ Jesus finally Brethren
[18:01] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[18:04] things are honest whatsoever things are
[18:06] just whatsoever things are pure
[18:09] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[18:11] things are of good report if there be
[18:13] any virtue if there be any praise think
[18:17] on these
[18:19] things those things which you have both
[18:21] learned and received and heard and seen
[18:25] in me
[18:27] do
[18:28] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[18:31] so when that that that kind of alludes
[18:34] to the the thought that if I do these
[18:37] things God is going to be with me but if
[18:39] I don't do these things God will not be
[18:41] with me it kind of stands for uh
[18:44] reasonable statement so then if we if we
[18:47] think of what things are
[18:50] evil so why do we call things evil uh
[18:55] what what ex what would be evil well
[18:57] things that are not of God things that
[18:59] are of Satan right uh 1 Corinthians
[19:02] chapter 6 and verse
[19:04] 9 sorry this might be a basic message
[19:07] this evening but it it's it's just
[19:09] something
[19:12] simple so 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and
[19:14] verse 9 it says know ye not that the
[19:18] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[19:19] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[19:23] fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers
[19:27] nor effeminate
[19:29] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[19:31] nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards
[19:34] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[19:37] inherit the kingdom of God that's a
[19:39] pretty long list there but it's kind of
[19:41] laying it out avoid these things stay
[19:44] away from these things because it's
[19:45] going to take you away from God right so
[19:49] uh First Corinthians kind of going back
[19:51] there in ver excuse me chapter five and
[19:55] verse
[19:57] 9
[20:01] bear with me I have a few things to get
[20:03] through in the
[20:04] scripture I don't dare bring my own word
[20:07] but I I got to back it up with scripture
[20:13] right so 1 Corinthians chapter 5 verse
[20:17] 9 says I wrote unto you in an
[20:20] epistle excuse
[20:22] me not to company with
[20:25] fornicators yet not altogether with the
[20:28] fornicators of this
[20:31] world or with the Covetous or
[20:34] extortioners or with idolators for then
[20:37] must ye needs go out of the world he's
[20:39] saying you're going to encounter this
[20:40] stuff into the world he's not saying uh
[20:44] you know to not company with them of
[20:46] course you want to stay away from that
[20:48] kind of an atmosphere but uh let's see
[20:52] in verse 11 it says but now I have
[20:54] written unto you not to keep company if
[20:58] any man that is called a
[21:02] brother okay if any man that is called a
[21:05] brother be a fornicator or Covetous or
[21:09] an idolator or a or a drunkard or
[21:11] an extortioner with such a one know not
[21:14] to
[21:15] eat why because those are the ones that
[21:17] are supposed to know
[21:20] better that's that's uh uh iniquity
[21:24] doing something that you know is wrong
[21:26] but yet you do it anyway so that that's
[21:29] kind of being in the company of
[21:31] hypocrite knowingly doing things evil
[21:34] while proclaiming to still be good
[21:37] that's the kind of an atmosphere that we
[21:38] definitely want to stay away from right
[21:40] because we don't we don't want to be
[21:42] partakers with
[21:44] them so verse verse 12 it says for what
[21:48] have I to do to judge them also that are
[21:52] without do not ye judge them that are
[21:54] within another scripture says judgment
[21:57] begins at the house of the Lord right so
[22:00] this is where judgment begins we're not
[22:02] here to judge those that are out in the
[22:04] world but we're here to judge one
[22:05] another that we're that we're here
[22:07] members of of of the church members of
[22:10] Christ I guess you could say
[22:12] uh he says but them uh so do not ye
[22:17] judge them that are within so judgment
[22:19] starts at the house of God verse 13 it
[22:21] says but them that are without God them
[22:24] that are without God judgeth so we leave
[22:27] that
[22:28] for God to judge so therefore put away
[22:31] from among yourselves that Wicked person
[22:35] now see somebody that's committing these
[22:37] types of things he lays it out here that
[22:40] that is wickedness that is evil okay so
[22:45] and people are so confused in this day
[22:46] where they call good and they call good
[22:48] evil excuse me they call good evil and
[22:51] they call evil good
[22:53] uh we could all see that right because
[22:56] some people are saying abortion oh
[22:58] that's a good thing it's protecting the
[22:59] woman you can't tell me that 100% of
[23:01] abortions are are are protecting the
[23:04] woman it's done because of it because of
[23:07] its irresponsibility is why so many
[23:09] women do
[23:12] that and first it was designed to help
[23:15] save the
[23:19] woman that's the the the justification
[23:23] of it because if there was a woman that
[23:26] was that was going to be uh was going to
[23:28] die in child birth they wanted to try to
[23:30] save a woman right so uh but I don't see
[23:34] that the
[23:35] case we see that that's a very small
[23:37] percentage of the amount of women that
[23:39] that that uh have a hard uh have
[23:42] hardship with childbirth and possibly
[23:45] die from it my wife I'm I'm I'm not
[23:48] trying to brag or anything but it's by
[23:49] God's
[23:51] grace that she uh when we had Isaac uh
[23:54] she had the near stroke condition okay I
[23:58] I can't remember the term for it but uh
[24:01] her blood pressure was high it was
[24:02] Triple digits and they wanted to induce
[24:05] the baby and they said she it was close
[24:08] to Cheyenne's birthday hey can we wait
[24:09] such and such a date nope we're not
[24:11] waiting any longer we're going to take
[24:12] you in it was like the next day or two
[24:15] days after but they weren't even going
[24:18] to let her wait okay but we were going
[24:20] to keep Isaac
[24:22] anyways so that that's just the way it
[24:25] is uh so Roman chapter 6 and verse 15 if
[24:30] if you haven't noticed I don't support
[24:32] abortion at all so uh I I think they're
[24:35] arguments are weak they they try to and
[24:38] I'm not an intellectual that could even
[24:40] try to get scientific with them but
[24:42] morally I think it's wrong absolutely
[24:44] wrong especially when you know what they
[24:46] they the majority most of it is what
[24:49] they're using it
[24:55] for I was going to say something or not
[25:00] we're abstinence is the key so uh Romans
[25:04] 65 it says What then shall we sin
[25:07] because we are not under the law but
[25:09] under grace God
[25:13] forbid so just because we feel that
[25:16] we're not under the law because we're
[25:17] under grace that doesn't give us a
[25:19] ticket to go out and do whatever kind of
[25:21] stuff that we want to do that doesn't
[25:22] mean that we can go rob a bank because I
[25:24] need to uh pay my rent or you might have
[25:28] enough money to pay your rent you just
[25:29] want to want the big Jeep Wrangler that
[25:31] looks like a Humvee or whatever I don't
[25:33] know what what those are called but you
[25:37] know you see where the greed comes in
[25:40] where does it stop and and that's why a
[25:42] lot of people do what they do whether
[25:43] it's out of greed or whether it's out of
[25:45] a a a selfish
[25:47] motive verse 16 it says know ye not that
[25:51] to whom you yield yourselves servants to
[25:53] obey his servants you are to him you
[25:56] obey whether nether of sin unto death or
[25:59] of obedience unto righteousness so
[26:01] you're either going to serve sin or
[26:02] you're going to serve righteousness But
[26:05] whichever one you yield yourself to
[26:07] that's the one you're going to be
[26:08] servant to so verse 17 it says but God
[26:11] be thanked that you were the Servants of
[26:14] sin but you have obeyed from the heart
[26:16] that form of Doctrine which was
[26:18] delivered
[26:20] you you mean Doctrine gave Deliverance
[26:23] absolutely because it was of the right
[26:26] Doctrine
[26:28] rightly divide the word of
[26:30] God so Verse 18 it says being then made
[26:33] free from sin you became the Servants of
[26:36] righteousness I speak after the manner
[26:38] of men because of the infirmity of your
[26:40] flesh for as ye have yielded your
[26:42] members servants to uncleanness and to
[26:45] iniquity unto iniquity it's one thing
[26:48] after another it's one filthy act unto
[26:50] another filthy act unto another filthy
[26:52] act it just leads one to another to
[26:55] another and it's not going to give you
[26:56] any Deliverance so long as you're being
[26:58] a servant of uncleanness you're just
[27:00] going to live a life that's full of
[27:04] uncleanliness so even so now yield your
[27:07] yield your memb servants to
[27:09] righteousness unto Holiness and I thank
[27:11] God that we're able to do that amen so
[27:14] for when you were the Servants of sin
[27:16] you were free from righteousness you
[27:18] were free from all these dos and don'ts
[27:19] of of what we believe you know Thou
[27:21] shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou
[27:23] shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife and
[27:25] all these things you're free from that
[27:33] see people don't want to serve
[27:34] righteousness because they want to do
[27:36] those things that's what's in their
[27:38] heart to
[27:39] do see when you're a servant of sin
[27:42] you're free from righteousness you don't
[27:43] have to live by the dos and don'ts but
[27:46] what fruit do you had then in those
[27:48] things whereof you are now ashamed see
[27:51] we we tell our stories you know uh
[27:53] sister Naomi we probably tell our
[27:55] children stories or friends stories we
[27:57] test ify what God brought us from to
[27:59] what we are now you know some people
[28:01] they they laugh it up and they and
[28:03] they're yeah I got away with this and I
[28:05] got away with that with no sorrow in
[28:07] their testimony because there should be
[28:10] and and I'm guilty of that I've I've
[28:11] done that before you know uh you just
[28:13] talk about how how how bad you were or
[28:16] or things like that and who knows what
[28:18] it was going to what it was leading up
[28:20] to but but still it should be a shameful
[28:24] feeling because if that's what Drew us
[28:26] to repent repentance we were ashamed
[28:28] then why aren't we ashamed of it
[28:31] now that same shame which caused us to
[28:34] repent should remain the same
[28:37] shame or even more more sorrow because
[28:40] of what we
[28:42] did but in verse 21 it says what fruit
[28:45] had ye then in those things whereof you
[28:47] are now ashamed for the end of those
[28:49] things is death for the wages of sin is
[28:51] death right well sorry getting getting
[28:53] ahead of myself verse 22 but now being
[28:55] made free from sin and and become
[28:57] servants to God you have your fruits
[29:00] unto Holiness in the end everlasting
[29:03] life see it's what we're looking to what
[29:06] we want to serve or what we yield
[29:08] ourselves to in verse 23 it says for the
[29:11] wages of sin is death but the gift of
[29:14] God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
[29:17] Our
[29:19] Lord but see since we've separated
[29:21] ourselves from those things we could
[29:24] move on unto righteousness we can move
[29:26] on to a clean
[29:29] life amen so then after after Genesis
[29:35] after uh Cain and Abel we see that there
[29:38] weren't a whole lot of rules established
[29:40] but it was uh since Moses came of course
[29:42] there were you know talking to Abraham
[29:44] making different covenants because
[29:45] that's how the rules came is through a
[29:47] covenant right it was a conditional
[29:49] thing if you do such and such if you
[29:51] obey me here I will bless you here you
[29:54] know that's pretty much what the
[29:55] Covenant was you do this you be obedient
[29:57] I will
[29:58] give but if you break it you won't
[30:01] get so we we see that as kind of a rule
[30:06] so it wasn't until uh Exodus and
[30:09] Leviticus uh and and uh numbers in
[30:12] Deuteronomy where there were a whole lot
[30:14] more rules that were applied right so
[30:19] and again covenants they were made uh in
[30:21] in trust with conditions uh so we
[30:25] everybody knows what a covenant is a it
[30:27] as agreement between two parties so and
[30:30] the with the expectation of trust to
[30:33] carry it out for each party to carry out
[30:36] their burden of the
[30:38] Covenant so when it was broken he that
[30:41] knows to do good but doesn't it's a it
[30:44] is a sin unto him right so uh we
[30:49] had uh I don't know how many covenants
[30:52] there were I I can't think I want to say
[30:54] that there were seven covenants but but
[30:56] we know we had Adam we had we had Noah
[30:57] we had uh Abraham we had Moses we had
[31:00] David and then we had the Messiah and
[31:01] I'm missing one somewhere in there uh
[31:05] you know if you look it up they they've
[31:06] got all kinds of different things in
[31:08] there the Palestinian Covenant the New
[31:09] Covenant the power Covenant or I can't
[31:11] even remember what they're term it why
[31:14] can't we just stick to the scripture of
[31:16] of what the Covenant is you
[31:18] know you know some people just make
[31:20] things more complicated because they
[31:22] want to look more spiritual than what
[31:23] they actually
[31:26] are
[31:32] so the most popular thing about the the
[31:34] rules or the laws are known as the Ten
[31:36] Commandments right everybody knows the
[31:38] Ten Commandments or or at least a couple
[31:40] or a
[31:42] few
[31:47] uh let's
[31:54] see can't make I don't even know why
[31:56] that's
[31:58] but any the scripture also tells us that
[32:00] we ought to listen to those you know be
[32:03] obedient unto those that have rule over
[32:05] us and uh just as we read through uh the
[32:08] different gifts you know the gifts of
[32:10] Miracles the diffs Gifts of discerning
[32:11] of spirits and the different things so
[32:14] uh we see as the the five-fold ministry
[32:18] they have different uh they ALS there's
[32:20] also different gifts as far as excuse me
[32:23] the five-fold ministry because not
[32:24] everybody's a pastor not everybody's a
[32:26] uh an apostle not everybody's a prophet
[32:29] you know uh not everybody's just a a
[32:32] preacher or the different things an
[32:34] evangelist uh but the scripture also
[32:37] tells us to be obedient to those that
[32:40] have the rule over us not as in a in a a
[32:43] thumb but those that watch after our
[32:45] souls amen because they they should have
[32:48] a genuine concern for our well-being
[32:50] that whenever they see us do something
[32:52] or see the church uh doing something
[32:55] that some that they're somewhere along
[32:56] the line there there should be coming a
[32:58] rebuke because the discernment of Good
[33:01] and Evil should should be should be made
[33:03] right so you look upon the the church
[33:06] you see how the church is behaving H
[33:08] this just doesn't seem right you know it
[33:10] could be from the pulpit it could be in
[33:12] from the congregation whatever it might
[33:14] be somebody might well I don't see that
[33:16] that seems to be heresy they're not
[33:18] acting quite just
[33:19] right and then it gets called out by
[33:23] what by a discernment whether it's an
[33:26] evangelist that comes whether it's a
[33:27] preacher like myself that comes or
[33:29] whether it's your pastor you know the
[33:31] discernment could go forth because I
[33:33] don't know what you think about when
[33:35] you're when you lay your head on your
[33:36] pillow I don't know what you think about
[33:37] at night and I don't know what you think
[33:39] about at lunchtime so you see it it's
[33:41] the inspiration or the discernment of
[33:44] the holy spirit it's not it's not the
[33:46] man that really has the discernment
[33:48] unless they're able to read minds you
[33:49] know unless they have that actual gift
[33:51] of discernment we won't know but there
[33:53] is a time if everything if if you sin
[33:56] and you come into the prayer line
[33:58] everything is repented of brother Bram
[34:00] said that he wouldn't be able to see
[34:01] that because it's under the blood but he
[34:04] also gave the warning if you come up for
[34:06] prayer don't come with sin in your life
[34:08] because it'll be called out in public
[34:10] right it was that discernment that went
[34:13] to work why to embarrass that person no
[34:17] to get them clean to get them right to
[34:20] get them into repentance that they could
[34:21] have a confidence to receive from the
[34:24] Lord that that there's no more
[34:27] condemnation in the heart but it that is
[34:29] pure amen see and that's and that's
[34:33] where it falls of of of those that that
[34:35] have the rule over you again it's it's
[34:37] not a dictatorship but it's who's
[34:39] looking after your
[34:41] souls for the betterment not to say no
[34:44] no no I'm I'm ahead over you that's that
[34:47] that's the wrong Spirit that's the wrong
[34:48] attitude and I wouldn't want somebody
[34:50] like that in the popit you know I I
[34:52] wouldn't be hanging around if somebody
[34:53] was like that you know being
[34:55] condescending uh uh to to the
[34:57] congregation and saying I'm so much
[35:00] higher than you I'm sure brother Jesse
[35:01] doesn't feel that way because he's he's
[35:03] going to be open and honest to say hey
[35:05] I've got faults and failures too I'm
[35:07] know I'm know better than anybody else
[35:09] in here I I know he feels that way
[35:11] because he's got something hanging on
[35:12] his wall right there that attributes
[35:14] that you know to be a servant to men
[35:17] right but it's not whether you know
[35:20] gifts and callings are without
[35:21] repentance so it so where where does
[35:25] that fall
[35:27] that falls in with the
[35:29] gifts okay so gifts and callings are
[35:31] without repentance so if somebody's
[35:33] called to do something you don't have to
[35:35] repent to do to do such and such but if
[35:38] you're going to watch after somebody if
[35:39] you're going to be a servant unto the
[35:41] Lord the desire should be to be clean
[35:44] before the Lord amen because that's
[35:46] that's what the Levites had to do is
[35:47] they had to cleanse themselves even
[35:49] before they went in into the temple into
[35:52] the holiest of holies they had to have a
[35:54] purification they had to be cleansed and
[35:56] and being it far from us if there's a
[35:58] minister up here that that that just
[36:00] lives in sin and comes and tries to pray
[36:03] for
[36:05] you again it's not the man right but
[36:08] it's the faith unto the
[36:12] believer see I wouldn't want to do I I
[36:14] wouldn't want to do something like that
[36:16] I would feel so horrible and and
[36:18] sometimes I do over the over the
[36:20] silliest things you you know I'm not
[36:21] going to explain anything but even just
[36:24] the silly things silliest things we tend
[36:26] to be ourselves up on you know well
[36:30] never mind I'm not going to go but you
[36:32] get what I'm saying is uh so man I get
[36:36] into that is I can't pray for anybody I
[36:38] can't pray for so and so you know I
[36:40] thought this I thought that well it's
[36:42] not that because if there's repentance
[36:44] that comes and and follows right after
[36:46] then there's no nothing held to your
[36:48] charge it's under the blood so how's it
[36:52] going to hinder somebody if it's under
[36:53] the
[36:54] blood now are we going to
[36:57] uh go out and sin just so we can Lord
[37:00] forgive me for this and then go out and
[37:01] do it again and Lord forgive me for this
[37:03] you know every hour upon the hour no
[37:06] because our heart is wrong even though
[37:08] the Lord would forgive us but if that's
[37:09] our motive to go out and do something
[37:11] well the Lord will forgive me when I
[37:12] whenever I go repent your heart is
[37:15] wrong your heart is wrong because it
[37:17] should be Grievous unto us that we
[37:19] shouldn't go unto under the things that
[37:21] we know are evil right because we want
[37:24] to cling to things that are good
[37:27] so uh we have we have laws that are made
[37:30] in the judicial system that's supposed
[37:32] to be enforced by law enforcement right
[37:35] so again some uh a lot of these law
[37:39] enforcement officers are out there
[37:41] you'll see them speeding by but man if
[37:43] you go five miles over the speed limit
[37:45] boy that pull you
[37:49] over you see what I mean you see you see
[37:51] where it comes so and and I can't help
[37:53] it but think of uh I I think it's
[37:55] Samuel's Samuel's two sons that were
[37:57] priests and they were living ungodly
[38:00] right so uh hni and finaz I think that's
[38:04] his son's name but they were living in
[38:06] sin but Eli wouldn't rebuke it even even
[38:09] when he was told to do so he didn't do
[38:12] it excuse me
[38:14] Eli uh Samuel's Sons didn't didn't live
[38:17] uh uh very righteous
[38:20] either but Eli is who I was talking
[38:22] about and uh he didn't rebuke his sons
[38:25] even when Samuel told told him look you
[38:27] better get this stuff right but he still
[38:29] didn't pay attention to it it was
[38:31] somebody looking after his
[38:33] soul amen so so even laws in the
[38:37] judicial system that's supposed to be
[38:38] enforced by law enforcement so we have
[38:41] that so we have that in this country we
[38:43] have that in they have that in other
[38:45] countries so when we get this mindset
[38:48] why I I can't I I've heard it from
[38:49] people that are left church I I've heard
[38:52] it from people that have left God allog
[38:53] together well it's just too many rules
[38:56] too many dos and don'ts you know
[38:58] children that want to leave homes
[38:59] because there there are too many rules I
[39:01] can't do this I can't do that I can't do
[39:03] what I want because it's a selfish
[39:07] motive it's a selfish motive not
[39:11] Discerning you know uh when we lay rules
[39:14] out as a parent We Lay rules out for the
[39:17] protection of our children youall might
[39:18] not understand that but you'll
[39:20] understand by and by when you have
[39:21] children you you'll understand so sister
[39:23] Naomi sister beus we make these rules
[39:26] and uh other parents we make these rules
[39:28] for the protection of our children you
[39:31] might think that it's unjust you might
[39:33] think that it's not fair that you can't
[39:35] go out with your friends that are out
[39:36] and and drinking and carrying on and
[39:38] doing everything else uh Under the Sun
[39:40] that they shouldn't be doing and you
[39:42] think it's unfair my parents should let
[39:44] me go wherever I want to go well they're
[39:47] looking out for your well-being because
[39:49] they don't want you to get caught up
[39:51] into something like that amen they they
[39:54] want it so they want you to be so far
[39:56] from that that because they know the
[39:58] path that it leads to and that path
[40:00] leads to
[40:02] destruction self-destruction family
[40:05] destruction relationship destruction
[40:08] friendship destruction uh you name it
[40:12] employee employer
[40:14] destruction that's what it just leads to
[40:17] so you might think that whoever's
[40:20] listening you might think that your
[40:21] parents are unfair because they make
[40:23] rules just remember they're looking out
[40:25] for your soul
[40:27] see and and a lot of times we think it's
[40:29] unfair you know and and and I'm saying
[40:31] this because I've heard people say well
[40:34] I want to cut my hair I can't follow
[40:36] that because you all believe that uh
[40:38] that you shouldn't cut your hair well at
[40:39] least come to church even if you think
[40:41] that you shouldn't cut your hair because
[40:43] who's criticizing you might hear it come
[40:44] across a pull pit or
[40:46] something you know but still you're
[40:48] hearing the truth but that just shows
[40:49] what's in their heart well I don't want
[40:50] to follow I don't want to follow what it
[40:52] says in the word you know dress modesty
[40:55] well I want to I want want to wear
[40:56] something a little bit more revealing I
[40:58] I kind of like that because I get more
[40:59] attention that's not the kind of
[41:01] attention that a sister should be
[41:04] getting but they should be getting
[41:06] attention from a from a respectful young
[41:08] man with respectful
[41:10] desires and treating you
[41:14] well I got your dad's back by the
[41:18] way that's a lot of back to
[41:21] carry you got a lot of sisters and you
[41:24] got a brother I'll be I'll be behind my
[41:26] I'll be next to the line I'll be there
[41:28] to help you out no but we want to take
[41:30] care of our daughters especially right
[41:32] so uh you mean Sons aren't worth
[41:36] much yes you are but but but there's a
[41:40] little bit more to a daughter that that
[41:41] people just don't realize there's
[41:43] there's more uh how do I want to put it
[41:46] there's more innocency at stake there's
[41:48] more more at stake for a woman for a
[41:51] young lady okay so uh yes we still care
[41:55] about you young men men we still care
[41:57] deeply about you young men because you
[41:59] you that's who's going to be protecting
[42:01] the the sisters
[42:04] right
[42:07] so in in the discernment of what is good
[42:10] and evil Discerning so Isaac is eight
[42:13] years old he's my he's my youngest and I
[42:15] am not going to let him drive me to
[42:18] Texas just because of he thinks he's
[42:20] able to drive he's a he can't drive he
[42:24] could he can't even drive a lawn mother
[42:26] much less my vehicle to Texas right so
[42:29] let let's you might say that that sounds
[42:31] childish but that's the discernment of
[42:34] the capability of the vessel okay the
[42:38] maturity level of the vessel so we ought
[42:40] to be our our senses ought to be
[42:43] exercised in discernment to where we
[42:45] could discern good and evil if we just
[42:48] let down the bars then we have no more
[42:49] discernment we just do whatever we want
[42:52] and no wonder people are muddled up uh
[42:54] not knowing what is good and what is
[42:55] evil because it all comes together and
[42:58] they can't they can't separate it
[43:00] because they've just let down the bars
[43:02] and they let anything happen and they
[43:04] indulge in
[43:05] anything so
[43:08] uh Hebrews chapter
[43:11] 5 and verse 11 just bear with me for a
[43:15] little bit longer I don't I don't plan
[43:17] on being that much
[43:20] longer I don't know if anybody knows
[43:22] brother Kenny
[43:25] CS had asked at byc being brother Jeremy
[43:28] Lord y probably don't know any me
[43:31] uh what does it mean when a when a
[43:34] message preacher says I'm
[43:40] closing absolutely
[43:44] nothing Well close when the spirit says
[43:47] close right
[43:49] so Hebrews chapter 5 some people just
[43:52] say it just to get the people awake
[43:53] because as soon as you say I'm closing
[43:55] they per up
[43:58] yeah so verse 11 it says of whom we have
[44:01] many things to say and hard to be
[44:04] uttered seeing y'all seeing ye are dull
[44:07] of hearing for when for the time you
[44:10] ought to be teachers you need that one
[44:13] teach you again which be the first
[44:15] principles the very basics of the
[44:18] oracles or the utterances of God and nor
[44:21] become such as have need
[44:24] milk and not of strong WR meat see a
[44:27] newborn baby can't eat meat obviously
[44:29] because it can't chew it up because it's
[44:31] not mature to eat that kind of food but
[44:34] a new believer a new convert needs to
[44:36] eat or needs to drink on the Milk of the
[44:38] word the easy things right not so much
[44:41] the hard things but uh why is it that
[44:44] when a a potential convert comes and and
[44:47] and we just want to ram all the
[44:49] Mysteries down and W how about if we get
[44:51] them to Christ first and and and let
[44:53] them have their experiences because
[44:55] they're going to have they need to have
[44:56] Falls to learn how to get back up you
[44:59] know so start it's like a newborn babe
[45:01] that you're teaching a little toddler
[45:03] how to walk you know they're going to
[45:04] stumble they're going to fall so we
[45:06] can't criticize a new believer just
[45:09] because they've stumbled and
[45:11] fell because that's all they
[45:13] know they don't know it yet so we got to
[45:17] we got to have a a a certain level of
[45:20] Grace right uh but as it comes as they
[45:25] go through the uring process you go you
[45:28] go from uh uh infant to uh toddler to
[45:32] adolescent to teen to
[45:35] adult it's a
[45:38] geriatric but there's a whole process of
[45:40] life right
[45:42] so uh we have to give the baby the
[45:45] newborn we have to give them milk and
[45:48] then as they grow you can give them the
[45:50] crackers you can give them the Skittles
[45:53] not not the not the Smith family you're
[45:56] not allowed
[45:57] to but you see what I mean you and then
[45:59] they can go on to things that are harder
[46:01] to uh digest harder to eat you know
[46:04] different things
[46:06] so uh verse 13 it says for everyone that
[46:10] useth milk is unskillful in the word of
[46:13] righteousness for he is a babe because
[46:16] he just doesn't know any better yet see
[46:18] no wonder I think it's in Timothy uh if
[46:20] not that y'all are seeking a pastor but
[46:22] you a pastor should not be in place if
[46:24] they are a novice
[46:26] because they'll get headyy high minded
[46:28] they'll get puffed up and then they'll
[46:30] fall okay because they don't know how to
[46:33] handle things yet so uh verse 14 it says
[46:38] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[46:39] are of a full age even those who by
[46:42] reason of use have their senses
[46:45] exercised to
[46:47] discern now to to discern there means to
[46:50] to distinguish to judge both Good and
[46:54] Evil so see their uh strong meat
[46:57] belongeth to them that are of a full age
[46:59] now see their perception is mixed with
[47:01] experience to know and understand the
[47:04] difference of what is good and what is
[47:06] evil that's the one that's
[47:08] experienced the one that has become
[47:10] mature they they their perception or
[47:14] their uh
[47:17] discernment is mixed with experience
[47:19] they've been through something before so
[47:21] they know how to handle the situation
[47:23] they know uh they see a certain certain
[47:25] thing a certain individual behaving a
[47:28] certain way I know where this leads I've
[47:30] done seen this before we better take
[47:32] care of this right now
[47:35] right so I'm going to give some examples
[47:38] of definitions because it's it's used
[47:40] differently throughout the throughout
[47:41] the Scripture it it's pretty synonymous
[47:44] but you'd be surprised uh it it might be
[47:47] a little bit different from what you
[47:48] think so 2 Samuel 14 and verse1
[47:54] 17 it says says then thine handmaid said
[47:57] the word of my Lord the king shall now
[48:00] be comfortable for as an angel of God so
[48:03] is my Lord the king to discern good and
[48:06] bad therefore the Lord thy God will be
[48:09] with thee now see discern there means to
[48:12] hear or to listen or give attention to
[48:16] remember we were talking this morning
[48:18] about focusing on the right object so
[48:20] it's giving the right attention to okay
[48:23] so hearing and listening and giving
[48:25] attention
[48:27] to First Kings 3 and
[48:30] ver9 it says give therefore thy servant
[48:33] an understanding heart to judge thy
[48:36] people see he didn't have a selfish
[48:38] motive that I may discern between good
[48:41] and bad for who is able to judge this th
[48:45] so great a people he had a lot of people
[48:48] to go through for judgment so
[48:50] discernment there means Insight
[48:53] understanding or being observant
[49:00] First Kings uh chapter 20 verse
[49:09] 41 I say I like how Solomon ask for
[49:11] wisdom because you know the scripture
[49:13] says that if any man asks wisdom let him
[49:16] ask of God now see the Lord asked
[49:17] Solomon the one time says what is it
[49:19] that you would want me to give you he
[49:22] could have chosen great riches he could
[49:24] have he had lot of wise UNC concubines
[49:27] uh he could ask for more popularity than
[49:30] what he what he actually ended up
[49:32] receiving but would he could have had a
[49:34] selfish heart and just asked for
[49:36] something for him but he asked for
[49:39] wisdom and here as we read uh an
[49:42] understanding heart to judge the people
[49:45] he wanted to do right so he wanted to be
[49:47] a servant of righteousness right so uh
[49:50] First Kings chap 20: 41 it says and he
[49:53] hasted and took the ashes away from from
[49:55] his face and the king of Israel
[49:58] discerned him that he was of the
[50:00] prophets now discern there means to
[50:03] recognize acknowledge regard or
[50:09] respect see he recognized that there was
[50:12] a a a prophet amongst them how how would
[50:15] he be able to recognize that unless he
[50:17] had seen one before unless it had
[50:20] contact with a with one beforehand see
[50:23] that's that's where that that
[50:24] discernment mixed with with experience
[50:26] comes in there was a certain way that a
[50:28] prophet behaved and when he came in
[50:30] contact with with a a different prophet
[50:34] he recognized him as he would be one
[50:36] among the
[50:37] prophets see it's Discerning through the
[50:42] experience one more Ezekiel 44 and
[50:52] 23 is it okay to for 10 more minutes
[50:58] don't hold me to that but we'll try uh
[51:01] Ezekiel 44 and
[51:04] 23 it says and they shall teach my
[51:07] people the difference between the holy
[51:10] and profane and cause them to discern
[51:14] between the unclean and the clean now
[51:17] see discern there means to teach the
[51:20] people to know the
[51:24] difference
[51:30] I'm trying to find that uh going to go
[51:32] back to where I think it was
[51:34] the thought it was the opening scripture
[51:36] that we had where brother was saying
[51:39] that which you see uh in me what you've
[51:42] heard in me that should you
[51:48] do yeah Philippians 4:9 it says those
[51:52] things which ye have both learned and
[51:54] received and heard and and seen in me do
[51:57] and the God of Peace uh shall be with
[52:04] you so teaching the people to know the
[52:06] difference Paul was saying you saw what
[52:09] I've done I've written unto you how to
[52:10] how to how to recognize these things or
[52:14] uh I've shown you how to conduct
[52:16] yourself and then anything outside of
[52:18] that you know that it's it's not going
[52:20] to be good you know for we're taught to
[52:22] preach what Paul T Paul preached right
[52:24] so that's what we want to do so whatever
[52:27] we've learned from that we want to carry
[52:29] on to teach somebody else right
[52:33] so the holy and profane well who's to
[52:35] say what's holy and what's profane well
[52:37] God established what was holy and
[52:39] profane and Paul and the teachers the
[52:41] apostles all those before us they taught
[52:44] the same thing of what God set aside as
[52:47] set aside as holy and what was profane
[52:50] and they moved right they moved to work
[52:53] toward that they worked in in one mind
[52:56] and one Accord yes they had a little
[52:58] hiccup when when Peter was trying to uh
[53:00] tell the tell uh the Gentiles to live as
[53:03] the Jews and then he was embarrassed
[53:05] when the Jews came because he was living
[53:07] as a
[53:08] gentile but then Paul rebuked him right
[53:11] because he ended up having uh Barnabas
[53:13] being caught in the same thing that he
[53:15] was teaching so not only did he did he
[53:18] hinder a couple a few other people but
[53:20] he hindered Barnabas so see that's where
[53:23] we need to be exercised in our
[53:25] discernment and rightly divide the word
[53:27] of
[53:30] God now see what happens is is uh we
[53:33] don't recognize the atmosphere or the
[53:36] influence of that atmosphere okay so a
[53:39] rotten atmosphere is like a poison now
[53:42] see some poisons work slow where others
[53:44] are
[53:47] fast some poisons are
[53:49] slow because it it it it's just like sin
[53:52] when it comes in in its infancy it seems
[53:54] so hard harmless but once it grows once
[53:57] it matures you'll get to see what it is
[53:59] because that's a law of a law of a seed
[54:02] right you got if you don't know what
[54:03] kind of a seed it is you plant it and
[54:04] then you got to wait for it to grow up
[54:06] and mature and then you can see what it
[54:07] is right so uh you you can
[54:13] come I'm going to turn to 1 Corinthians
[54:16] chap 11 verse
[54:22] 29 when I said one more for Ezekiel that
[54:24] was the examples of of
[54:29] discernment I didn't say one more one
[54:31] more
[54:32] scripture 1 Corinthians 11:29 it says
[54:35] for he that eateth and drinketh
[54:37] unworthily this is this is a communion
[54:39] uh scripture here right so for he that
[54:42] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[54:44] and drinketh Damnation to himself not
[54:46] Discerning the Lord's body and we we
[54:49] understand we believe that it is not a
[54:51] literal body it is not literal
[54:54] blood but is a it is a sign it is a h a
[54:58] poor substitute I mean uh but that's
[55:01] what we do to commemorate the Lord's
[55:03] body for what he's done for us the
[55:05] sacrifice that he's made for us for this
[55:07] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[55:11] and many
[55:12] sleep because we don't discern the
[55:14] Lord's
[55:16] body or we don't have the right
[55:18] discernment we don't we don't rightly
[55:20] discern what is in our lives we don't
[55:22] take proper inventory of our
[55:26] lives because we get to that point well
[55:28] I'm okay I'll go ahead and and partake
[55:30] of
[55:31] communion but then you're partaking
[55:34] unworthily because before you come to
[55:36] communion you should be cleaning
[55:39] up right I I believe brother Jesse would
[55:43] teach that here I I would hope that he
[55:45] would so before even come into communion
[55:48] service you got to make sure things are
[55:49] right see I I couldn't stand I I didn't
[55:51] like the way the communion service was
[55:53] before I gave my heart to the Lord you
[55:55] know because I I didn't want to do I
[55:56] didn't want to touch another man's foot
[55:58] you know and you know for the foot
[56:00] washing I I I couldn't do something like
[56:02] that but you know when I gave my heart
[56:04] to the Lord it was on a communion
[56:07] night and I watched another I watched
[56:09] another brother's
[56:10] feet something that I couldn't stand
[56:13] before I and now I can't I love
[56:15] communion service why because it makes
[56:18] me get in check it forces me to get
[56:21] right because I don't want to miss
[56:23] communion you can you can get into that
[56:25] place and say well I'm not going to take
[56:26] theun well I could get right but I kind
[56:29] of like where I am you and that's pretty
[56:32] dangerous because you're going to get so
[56:34] used to where you are that you don't
[56:36] want to come
[56:37] back oh
[56:41] my verse 31 for if we would judge
[56:44] ourselves we should not be judged but
[56:47] when we are judged we are chasten of the
[56:50] Lord that we should not be condemned
[56:52] with the world oh my see judgment begins
[56:57] at the house of the Lord amen so when we
[56:59] take care of things in
[57:01] house how much easier it is and then
[57:04] we're not counted we're not judged with
[57:06] the world we're judged by according to
[57:08] the scripture right it says judge you
[57:11] not unless you be judged by by the same
[57:14] standard so that's what that's what we
[57:16] want to judge by right and then if we
[57:19] use that as our as our judgment not so
[57:21] much the rod but at least the the act of
[57:23] judgement we could discern
[57:25] learn what's a good behavior and what's
[57:28] not so good a behavior right so and then
[57:31] we could judge that and say hey I don't
[57:33] think we should be doing that you know
[57:35] as Christians as Believers we shouldn't
[57:36] we shouldn't be doing this we shouldn't
[57:38] be doing that it just doesn't seem right
[57:40] it doesn't feel
[57:41] right okay so uh when we partake in
[57:46] communion partake uh uh in sincerity and
[57:49] not hypocrisy so I I think I preached
[57:52] something it might have been years ago
[57:53] but y'all know the word
[57:55] sincere sincere means without wax it's
[57:58] from the word sincere I don't it's kind
[58:01] of like a dictionary what is such and
[58:02] such well it means to do such I don't
[58:05] many dictionaries don't get along very
[58:06] well
[58:08] sometimes like if you look up
[58:10] propitiation it's uh to propitiate well
[58:13] that helped out a lot thanks you
[58:17] know that was a good
[58:20] one that's where we don't get
[58:23] along
[58:25] but when we partake communion we come
[58:27] with a sincerity and sincere the the the
[58:31] root word pretty much is to be without
[58:33] wax and what they would do back in the
[58:35] old olden days with clay pottery and and
[58:38] and and jars bowls whatever it is if
[58:40] they had a crack they would fill it with
[58:42] wax just so they could sell it when it
[58:44] should be thrown away because it's no
[58:45] good but then they sell it off as a as a
[58:47] good piece of pottery good good piece of
[58:50] it's not a what is
[58:53] that I think of the dishes my wife just
[58:56] had to have some uh don't tell
[59:00] her it's the kind that it could fall and
[59:03] it doesn't break it's not corn something
[59:06] El I can't remember what it is but
[59:08] anyways I don't want to be hung up on
[59:10] that but coming in coming to communion
[59:14] partaking in communion without hypocrisy
[59:17] being true to yourself amen and being
[59:20] true to the
[59:21] Lord so uh you can stand your feet
[59:26] yeah I see the prodical son when when he
[59:29] when he told his dad that he uh wanted
[59:31] all his all his inheritance you know the
[59:34] the father said okay I'll give you all
[59:35] that he didn't he didn't really put up a
[59:37] fuss he didn't put up an argument but we
[59:39] know the story of the prod Goan is he he
[59:41] took all the in inheritance and then he
[59:43] he went and spent it on frivolous uh
[59:45] living you know things that that didn't
[59:47] really matter too much on uh on on uh
[59:50] food that he would be eating and
[59:52] drinking and then he just he just lived
[59:54] the life of of uh you know with no
[59:57] control I guess you could say and he
[59:59] just spent all his money on things that
[1:00:01] didn't
[1:00:03] matter see he didn't discern the the
[1:00:06] atmosphere that he was in he didn't
[1:00:08] discern his condition it wasn't until he
[1:00:11] got to his lowest of low and then he
[1:00:13] realized wait a second that even the
[1:00:16] servants at my father's house eat better
[1:00:18] than what I'm eating because he was
[1:00:19] eating pig
[1:00:21] slop so when he went home after he was
[1:00:24] able to discern the situation and that
[1:00:26] he was able to reconcile his situation
[1:00:28] as he went home his brother didn't
[1:00:30] discern the situation because the father
[1:00:33] said hey let's go kill the let's kill
[1:00:35] the fatted calf and then jealousy ensued
[1:00:37] Envy became part of the program there so
[1:00:42] the older brother didn't discern what
[1:00:43] the father
[1:00:45] saw because the father saw that he
[1:00:47] received his son back that his son was
[1:00:50] saved alive but the brother didn't see
[1:00:52] it that way all he saw was
[1:00:55] father's killing the fatted calf well
[1:00:57] you never killed the fatted calf for me
[1:00:59] and I've done everything that's
[1:01:01] right but rejoice in that the one of the
[1:01:04] 99 would be returned
[1:01:07] amen I I could say more but I'll just
[1:01:10] going to stop there but kind of the
[1:01:12] point is is uh it's not recognizing the
[1:01:15] atmosphere the influence of that
[1:01:17] atmosphere and it like I said it it acts
[1:01:20] like a poison uh arsenic was uh one
[1:01:23] example used uh many times uh years ago
[1:01:26] decades ago maybe century and centuries
[1:01:29] ago uh because it was easily accessible
[1:01:32] and it it could go undetected because it
[1:01:34] would act like flu like symptoms when
[1:01:36] the person took it and it didn't take
[1:01:38] much so uh women used it a lot for to
[1:01:42] the their husbands and that's how a lot
[1:01:43] of husbands died you know I don't know
[1:01:45] the situations maybe it was an abusive
[1:01:47] relationship or something I don't know
[1:01:49] but usually there's a selfish motive
[1:01:52] motive behind it but but just just to
[1:01:55] know that uh it it was it it was
[1:01:58] something easy and it worked fairly
[1:02:01] fairly slow at first it it depended on
[1:02:03] the amount but if you gave somebody a
[1:02:05] little bit here and there you know it it
[1:02:07] kind of it killed the person slowly so
[1:02:10] like I said the same thing with sin when
[1:02:12] we allow sin and we know the wages of
[1:02:14] sin is death so if you let a little bit
[1:02:16] in here a little bit in there and it
[1:02:18] just builds up into a whole big mature
[1:02:21] thing and then how are you going to get
[1:02:23] away from it because then you're going
[1:02:24] to speak evil against God because you
[1:02:27] don't want anything to do with church or
[1:02:28] God
[1:02:29] anymore so we must be careful the type
[1:02:32] of atmosphere that we have so
[1:02:39] uh I just saw this interview of this
[1:02:42] woman uh you know talking about Grace
[1:02:46] until it becomes disgrace you know we
[1:02:48] don't want to do that we don't we don't
[1:02:50] want to go do something to come and
[1:02:51] repent do something uh iniquity and then
[1:02:54] come to repent we don't want to we don't
[1:02:56] want to make Grace under disgrace right
[1:02:58] but I I saw an interview of the woman
[1:03:01] saying that uh and this this is not a a
[1:03:04] shot at at women by any mean but it's
[1:03:06] saying that uh uh the
[1:03:09] interview uh the woman was saying that
[1:03:12] women are a big contributor to the
[1:03:14] problem in society because uh women are
[1:03:17] generally more EAS easier on the
[1:03:20] children than what the men are that oh
[1:03:22] oh just we just got to love Johnny don't
[1:03:25] be too hard on them you you you know you
[1:03:28] know how it goes don't be too hard on
[1:03:29] them just uh we got to love them that's
[1:03:31] absolutely right we do have to love them
[1:03:33] we have to give Grace yep we have to
[1:03:35] give Grace but it's a father's tough
[1:03:38] love you know and some well uh the
[1:03:42] obviously the mother loves them more
[1:03:43] because they give Grace well if you
[1:03:45] think that a man doesn't love their
[1:03:47] children get in the way one
[1:03:51] time I wouldn't want to get in the way
[1:03:53] of an angry
[1:03:55] father especially if somebody's trying
[1:03:57] to hurt that child you know you just you
[1:03:59] you'll be able to see how much a a dad
[1:04:01] actually loves that child and and a
[1:04:03] mother too I'm not saying one is greater
[1:04:05] than the other but A Parent's Love for a
[1:04:08] child if you're hurting somebody's child
[1:04:10] you better watch
[1:04:13] out amen so because why because you love
[1:04:17] that child that's a part of you right oh
[1:04:22] I'll go ahead and close there Let's uh
[1:04:24] let's bow our heads for
[1:04:27] prayer heavenly father just thank you
[1:04:30] for the time that we've had here oh
[1:04:32] God and I pray that anything that was
[1:04:35] said I pray that uh that nothing would
[1:04:38] be empty but Lord I pray that it would
[1:04:40] be uh said in the way that uh somebody
[1:04:42] could really use it that uh it could
[1:04:44] help somebody's uh walk that they could
[1:04:47] walk more sincere in their lives that
[1:04:49] they could walk more true that they
[1:04:50] would have the desire to be a servant
[1:04:52] unto righteousness and not unto
[1:04:55] unrighteousness Lord our desire here
[1:04:57] would be that uh we would be vessels of
[1:04:59] Honor Lord be a far from us that we
[1:05:01] would be uh a vessel Of Dishonor Lord we
[1:05:03] don't uh be in our hearts that that
[1:05:06] wouldn't even be in our minds a desire
[1:05:09] to be un unclean vessel but Lord help
[1:05:12] that that desire to be stronger than
[1:05:14] ever before that we could uh that we
[1:05:16] would want to be a a vessel of Honor for
[1:05:19] you that we would be a vessel of
[1:05:20] cleanliness and righteousness help us
[1:05:23] that we would be a servant unto you and
[1:05:25] our fellow man our brothers and sisters
[1:05:29] Lord I just uh pray that when certain
[1:05:32] desires come into our lives that uh we
[1:05:34] would be able to discern whether it's a
[1:05:36] good desire or whether it's not a good
[1:05:38] desire and that we would be able to
[1:05:41] handle it through prayer through Godly
[1:05:43] counsel whatever it might be Lord I just
[1:05:46] think of uh the many times uh that
[1:05:49] people would ask a a question uh should
[1:05:52] I do this or shouldn't I do that Lord if
[1:05:54] the question stands and and and it goes
[1:05:57] so long unanswered then help us to stay
[1:05:59] away from that thing because if there's
[1:06:01] a question that if there's a doubt about
[1:06:03] it we should stay away from it so Lord I
[1:06:05] just pray that you would help us
[1:06:07] especially in this day there's so much
[1:06:08] there's so much
[1:06:11] uh there's there's so many scams out

[1:06:15] would try to deceive people uh there's
[1:06:18] so much deception out there Lord help us

[1:06:22] is right
