[0:00] finish that here tonight it went so well
[0:01] with brother Cam's message there by
[0:03] God's grace so I the Lord will water you
[0:06] every
[0:07] moment to preach on this here trust it's
[0:10] a blessing to the Saints
[0:14] here Isaiah
[0:18] 27 we'll just read verse three uh
[0:21] together by God's grace
[0:25] 273 me
[0:32] how many believe that God's watering you
[0:33] every moment praise God you're fully in
[0:36] the hand of God hallelujah I believe it
[0:37] with all my heart Hallelujah let's read
[0:40] that together verse three on on three
[0:41] one two three I the Lord do keep it I
[0:45] will water it every moment lest any
[0:48] heard it I will keep it night and day
[0:51] amen may God add his Blessing to the
[0:53] reading of his word you can be seated by
[0:56] God's
[0:57] grace so I'm going to briefly review
[0:59] here we looked at the context of Isaiah
[1:02] 27 last week and saw it was Israel in
[1:04] the Millennium especially according to
[1:06] the last verse uh of the chapter verse
[1:09] 13 it ends with uh a great trumpet being
[1:14] blown and then all that was uh all that
[1:17] were going to perish are all brought uh
[1:19] from Assyria uh Egypt they're brought to
[1:22] worship at the holy Mount so what time
[1:25] would a great trumpet be blown and
[1:27] heathens would all gather to Jerusalem
[1:29] to worship It could only be the
[1:30] Millennium there's no other time where
[1:32] it would happen right cuz remember we
[1:34] know from Zechariah all the nations are
[1:36] going to come against Israel uh during
[1:38] the tribulation period Every Nation will
[1:39] be gathered against Israel uh but Jesus
[1:42] Christ will deliver Israel Hallelujah so
[1:44] we saw the context of it we saw how God
[1:46] cannot forget Israel just like a uh the
[1:48] Bible said we're ingrained in the palm
[1:50] of his hands uh a woman may forget her
[1:53] suckling child the Bible said but God
[1:55] will never forget Israel and then we saw
[1:57] that God was and is Gathering Israel
[2:00] back to the Homeland uh over 3.5 million
[2:04] have come back uh scattered from
[2:06] different uh Nations and then we saw how
[2:08] the serpent or the leviathon in Isaiah
[2:11] 27 that's to be defeated is Satan that's
[2:14] to be defeated in Revelation 12 during
[2:17] the Great Tribulation period so we see a
[2:19] very striking parallel there to Satan
[2:22] being defeated Leviathan being defeated
[2:24] and then Israel has a time where she's
[2:27] watered day and night Hallelujah
[2:30] uh John 10 then we saw how brother mam
[2:32] combined that brother mam combined John
[2:34] 10 with Isaiah 27 uh and no one will be
[2:37] able to pluck Israel out of God's hand
[2:39] that's how we are right now nobody can
[2:41] pluck us out of the hand of God
[2:43] hallelujah hallelujah especially when we
[2:44] have a high priest who ever lives to
[2:46] make intercession for us glory and then
[2:48] we saw Matthew 20 the 11th Hour workers
[2:50] that's us we saw that we're in the
[2:52] vineyard and that ties in with uh Isaiah
[2:54] 27 because God calls Israel Vineyard
[2:57] that will bring forth red wine
[2:59] Hallelujah that's during the Millennium
[3:01] but we're in the vineyard now because uh
[3:03] Matthew 21 says God took the vineyard
[3:06] away from Hebrews or Jews and gave it to
[3:08] the Gentiles because they rejected uh
[3:11] the Messiah Jesus Christ They Crucified
[3:14] the the owner of the vineyard's son
[3:16] which was the Lord Jesus and then we saw
[3:18] how preachers are workers in the
[3:19] vineyard Paul said 1 Corinthians 3 and
[3:22] then we looked at Proverbs 24 there's a
[3:24] warning against laziness in the vineyard
[3:25] we don't want to be lazy we want to be
[3:27] about the father's business and then we
[3:30] brother we read a quote from Brother BR
[3:31] we have the same Holy Ghost so we have
[3:32] the same power the same uh anointing
[3:35] that was on the early church is on us
[3:36] hallelujah we just have to be yielded
[3:38] and then God does things like he takes
[3:40] away our M our our our Nightmares by
[3:42] God's grace I almost said migraines but
[3:43] yeah he takes that away too hallelujah
[3:45] it's going in Jesus name Hallelujah
[3:47] that's right and so uh then I ended with
[3:50] just a few things uh kind of did really
[3:51] fast quotes at the end I'm going to go a
[3:53] little longer on this now uh if you got
[3:55] your Bible let's go to Isaiah
[3:57] 25 I want you to see the Striking order
[4:00] now to me it's striking just how uh God
[4:02] places things uh in these successive
[4:05] chapters or cons consecutive chapters I
[4:07] was telling sister Zur about this
[4:09] briefly uh I just thought it would be
[4:10] interesting to show you uh so Isaiah
[4:14] 25:8 now after I read this I want you to
[4:17] say it out loud what event is this
[4:19] Isaiah 25:8 he will swallow up death in
[4:22] Victory and the Lord God will wipe away
[4:24] tears from off all faces and the rebuke
[4:26] of his people shall he take away from
[4:28] off all the Earth the Lord has spoken it
[4:32] Rapture very good that's because uh 1
[4:34] Corinthians 15:54 says death will be
[4:37] swallowed up in Victory right so now
[4:40] look at the consecutive order now this
[4:41] doesn't happen very much right
[4:42] especially with Isaiah Isaiah is all
[4:44] over the place right got a virgin shall
[4:46] conceive in chapter 7 and nine uh you
[4:49] got John the Baptist in Isaiah 35 uh but
[4:53] here look at 25 26 27 28 uh Isaiah CH
[4:57] 26: 20 and 21 now you can take a guess
[5:01] but you don't have to but take a guess
[5:02] read let's read Isaiah 26:20 and 21 now
[5:06] the previous 19 verses aren't about this
[5:08] but I think we can read this and
[5:10] understand what this is about come my
[5:12] people enter thou into my thy
[5:15] Chambers and shut thy doors about thee
[5:17] hide thyself as it were for a little
[5:19] moment sounds like a little season or
[5:21] like a time times and half a
[5:24] time right until the ignation be
[5:28] overpassed
[5:31] not so God's going to hide Israel until
[5:33] the Wrath is passed for behold the Lord
[5:36] cometh out of his place to punish the
[5:38] inhabitants of the Earth for their
[5:40] iniquity the Earth also shall disclose
[5:42] her blood and shall no more cover her
[5:45] slain what event do you think this is
[5:47] tribulation very good so look we got so
[5:50] far we got the right order we got the
[5:52] Rapture in 25 we got the tribulation in
[5:55] 26 27 we already know what that is
[5:58] that's the millennium
[6:00] so so far we got three in a row now that
[6:02] that's the end of it now because chapter
[6:04] 28 verse 11 and 12 after I read this say
[6:08] say this event if you know this
[6:10] event Isaiah 28 11- 12 for with
[6:14] stammering lips in another tongue will
[6:16] he speak to this people to whom he said
[6:19] this is the rest wherewith ye may cause
[6:21] the weary to rest and this is the
[6:23] refreshing yet they would not hear what
[6:25] event was that day of Pentecost very
[6:28] good everybody give yourself too there
[6:30] we got some good Bible uh Bible scholars
[6:34] right you because we know the order so
[6:37] it's just interesting to me 25 26 27
[6:40] we're in the right
[6:41] order 28 this is the day of Pentecost
[6:44] according to 1 Corinthians 1421 with
[6:46] stammering lips Paul said Paul quotes
[6:49] Isaiah
[6:50] 2811 and then this is the rest the rest
[6:52] was spoken of at Hebrews 4 1-11 Paul
[6:56] said ENT he said labor to enter into
[6:58] this rest because he said he said Israel
[7:00] already has a rest it's not the natural
[7:02] rest it's a spiritual rest Hallelujah
[7:05] and then this is the refreshing that's
[7:06] acts 3:19 Peter said this is the times
[7:09] of refreshing that will come from the
[7:11] Lord hallelujah the baptism of the Holy
[7:13] Ghost amen hallelujah so what again what
[7:15] do we see God hides these things from
[7:18] the eyes of the wise and prudent God can
[7:20] put these verses in any order and that's
[7:22] what God does he puts them in any order
[7:25] right it's like the puzzle pieces it's
[7:27] like the box of puzzle pieces right
[7:28] that's like the Bible Hallelujah right
[7:31] and you just got to it takes the Holy
[7:32] Spirit to take the verses put them in
[7:34] the right order now you can see the
[7:36] picture of of Prophecy Hallelujah so I
[7:38] thought you like that everybody like
[7:40] that by God's grace neat it's very
[7:41] interesting to see how God places these
[7:44] events in here now I want to uh let's go
[7:46] to John 4 I just want to this help
[7:48] brother Irvin last year actually that
[7:50] was the the the day that I got attacked
[7:51] by the demon power but uh thank God for
[7:53] a faithful wife who will pray for
[7:55] you uh John 4 of course is the Samaritan
[7:58] woman
[8:01] um verse uh 22 says ye worship you know
[8:04] not what Jesus talking to the woman for
[8:07] we know what we worship for salvation is
[8:09] of the Jews she was a Samaritan right
[8:11] half Jew half Gentile really half
[8:13] Babylonian right or half Assyrian
[8:15] because that the Bible said we we showed
[8:17] that they brought
[8:18] Babylonians uh for salvation is of the
[8:21] Jews uh but the hour cometh and now is
[8:24] when the true worshippers shall worship
[8:25] the father in spirit and Truth for the
[8:27] father seeketh such to worship Him I'm
[8:29] sorry I got a little dry throat verse 24
[8:32] God is a spirit and they that worship
[8:34] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[8:38] truth okay now uh go in verse 25 the
[8:41] woman sayith to him I know that Messiah
[8:43] cometh which is called Christ and when
[8:45] he has come he will tell us all
[8:48] things verse 26 Jesus said to her I that
[8:52] speak unto thee am he Hallelujah so I I
[8:57] just love this uh uh you know brother
[9:00] Bram told us all the things we need to
[9:02] have the Holy Ghost right and so Jesus
[9:05] tells the woman here all she needs to
[9:07] have the Living
[9:09] Water right and so I love it uh brother
[9:12] Ram finished the mysteries of God he
[9:14] turned our hearts back to the apostolic
[9:16] fathers thank you dear wife I appreciate
[9:18] that gonna ask somebody thank you
[9:19] awesome were you going to get that thank
[9:21] thank
[9:22] you thank you it's always during this
[9:24] fall time yes thanks good race kind of
[9:27] surprised she won though brother so just
[9:29] just
[9:31] kidding just kidding brother thank you
[9:33] for thinking about me brother I
[9:34] appreciate that now I wanted to go back
[9:37] to verse 14 though but whosoever
[9:39] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[9:41] him shall never
[9:42] thirst right and I was I preach that I
[9:45] preached that thought when brother irin
[9:46] was here the thought was you'll never
[9:48] thirst for the things of the world
[9:50] talking about your soul your flesh
[9:52] constantly wants the things of the world
[9:54] your mind gets tempted to think about oh
[9:56] I need this things of the world but
[9:58] Jesus said when you get this water
[10:00] you'll never thirst again it's speaking
[10:02] of you'll never thirst to live like you
[10:04] used to live hallelujah praise God right
[10:06] you'll you'll only thirst in the soul
[10:09] you'll only thirst to be like Christ
[10:11] Hallelujah so again remember God is
[10:14] watering he's constantly watering and so
[10:16] see we have we have a thirst for the
[10:18] water but it's got to be the The Thirst
[10:19] from the soul and we want to beat this
[10:21] flesh and and and train this mind to so
[10:24] all three parts of us thirst for the
[10:26] water of God hallelujah all right so
[10:29] that helped brother Irvin to see that
[10:30] that's the part we'll never thirst like
[10:32] we used to as
[10:33] Sinners and Jesus gave the woman the
[10:36] water right it was you're the Messiah
[10:39] right and and that's what I love about
[10:40] this you know I'll just say I think you
[10:42] don't know I think you know what I'm
[10:43] talking about once I heard this message
[10:45] I never thirsted to go back to
[10:47] denomination only to witness to them
[10:49] right and try to convince them that
[10:50] there's more you know right so that
[10:53] that's what happening here Jesus gives
[10:55] her the present truth the message of the
[10:57] hour and she doesn't thirst for those
[10:58] things anymore now she's satisfied
[11:01] because she knows she's got thus sayi
[11:03] the Lord hallelujah because Jesus was
[11:05] the Lord amen and that's what brother
[11:06] randam gave to us right brother Ram gave
[11:09] us thus sayi the Lord on all these
[11:10] topics on all the truth and it gives us
[11:13] overcoming power in fact I was listening
[11:15] to brother cam last Wednesday when he
[11:16] preached he was preaching on the godhead
[11:18] and brother brah said the godhead gives
[11:20] you so much strength because you know
[11:21] who God is amen right we just we just
[11:26] met another person recently who said I
[11:28] know who the father is a son is but I
[11:30] have no idea who the Holy Ghost is and
[11:31] they've been going to church for years I
[11:33] worked with a person her name was Sandy
[11:34] she told me that and then we recently I
[11:36] forget who it was somebody else told me
[11:37] that too it's the same idea that most
[11:40] churches don't know about the Holy Ghost
[11:41] but when you're talking to God the
[11:43] Father when you're talking to Jesus
[11:45] you're talking to the Holy Ghost because
[11:47] that's the spirit of God hallelujah
[11:49] there's only one Spirit hallelujah it's
[11:50] three manifestations but the same spirit
[11:53] that gives us strength to know who we
[11:55] serve gives us strength to know that
[11:57] when we talk to Jesus is actually giving
[11:59] us intercession to the Father the Holy
[12:01] Spirit praise God so it takes away all
[12:04] the questions Hallelujah it gives us
[12:06] strength to know who he who God Is Now
[12:08] John 7:37 here's the one here's the one
[12:11] you'll never thirst again because God
[12:12] puts this Fountain inside you I just
[12:14] want to just State this again in the
[12:16] last day that great day of the feast
[12:18] Jesus stood and cried If any man thirst
[12:20] let him come unto me and
[12:22] drink so I love that the invitations to
[12:25] anybody uh I invited brother Chris back
[12:27] to church he said I'll try to come on
[12:29] Wednesday so thanks for telling me about
[12:30] that I'm trying to get him to come back
[12:31] to church all right just like you buddy
[12:33] Hallelujah trying to get him that soul
[12:35] back in here
[12:36] hallelujah but but see he's invited back
[12:39] everybody's invited to drink Hallelujah
[12:42] Jesus didn't say well just these certain
[12:43] race or that that age or that gender you
[12:46] know uh but everybody's invited he that
[12:48] believeth on me as the scripture said
[12:50] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[12:52] Living
[12:53] Water I love those moments don't you
[12:55] don't you love those moments when you
[12:56] know God has heard your prayer or God
[12:58] has heard your praise God has accepted
[13:00] your worship or God has given you a
[13:02] testimony to witness to somebody or to
[13:04] sing a song for God and you know God was
[13:06] in that it's like it was just flowing
[13:08] out of you that's that's God taking over
[13:10] that's God's word that that's God's
[13:12] promise to you Hallelujah that God's
[13:14] going to water you day and night
[13:15] hallelujah
[13:18] amen because it's inside of you the
[13:20] water is actually inside in your soul
[13:22] but this fake key of the spirit which
[13:24] they that believe on him should receive
[13:26] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[13:28] because that Jes Jesus was not
[13:31] glorified Hallelujah glory to God now
[13:34] church so we we need to reme we just
[13:36] need to remember this the water that I
[13:38] have need of is inside of me and I got
[13:41] to let it uh flow out of me Hallelujah
[13:44] just like that song that gratitude come
[13:46] up my soul don't you get shy on
[13:49] me right and really it's never the soul
[13:52] shy it's the mind that shy what are
[13:53] people going to think if I shout or
[13:55] scream or praise the Lord or if I if I
[13:58] give God
[13:59] Glory uh it's your mind that gets shy so
[14:02] we got to forget about our feelings and
[14:04] we got to remember we're in the presence
[14:05] of the king we're entertaining the king
[14:07] tonight Hallelujah we only care what the
[14:10] king thinks about us hallelujah right
[14:12] when it all comes down to it
[14:14] Hallelujah so we must remember that and
[14:16] the Bible says stir up your Most Holy
[14:18] Faith through prayer right Peter says
[14:20] stir up the gift of God stir up your
[14:22] pure Minds by way of remembrance so see
[14:25] that's how we get ourselves sred up
[14:26] remember what you used to be remember
[14:28] how you used to serve God uh but then
[14:30] also pray right prayer stirs up uh stirs
[14:33] up your your mind so you can receive
[14:36] what God has from the soul hallelujah oh
[14:39] I love it Hallelujah when God gives you
[14:40] something on your heart and God gives
[14:42] you like when God put this on my heart
[14:44] even as I was studying I just felt it
[14:45] flowing out it's kind of one of those
[14:46] things if you're a musician you know
[14:48] about it you know it just kind it just
[14:50] kind of flows right oh this here and
[14:51] then that it's all it's just all time
[14:53] together it's all flowing together it's
[14:55] flowing out Hallelujah now that's right
[14:58] now so when your Soul's thirsty you got
[15:00] to cry out to God and he gives us a
[15:03] drink so we see in Psalms 42:1 if you
[15:05] have your Bibles we're going to be
[15:06] reading in three portions of the
[15:11] Psalms and brother cam sent me a nice
[15:13] message on Monday just to say how much
[15:15] he enjoyed fellowship with everybody so
[15:16] thank you for your support and he said
[15:18] you just have a real sweet church so I
[15:20] said that's right we do got a real sweet
[15:22] Church let's keep it that way right by
[15:25] God's grace Psalm 42:1 to the chief
[15:29] musician maskill for the sons of Kora as
[15:32] the heart panteth after the water Brooks
[15:34] so panteth my soul after thee oh God now
[15:37] the word Pat means to long for like a
[15:40] you know like an animal longing for
[15:41] water right and so uh even David in the
[15:45] Old Testament had these times when when
[15:47] his his soul was longing for more of God
[15:50] and that's what we need we need to long
[15:51] for more of God right and we can do it
[15:53] every day the Bible said we should be
[15:54] hungering and thirsting after
[15:56] righteousness verse two my soul thir for
[15:59] God see for the Living God When shall I
[16:02] come and appear before God so we need to
[16:06] stop and feel the panting of the Soul
[16:08] because the world has filled our minds
[16:10] with so many distractions and we got to
[16:13] quiet ourselves down just to feel the
[16:15] thirst of the soul my uh I'd like a real
[16:17] fresh drink out of the Bible I'd like to
[16:19] read a few chapters this morning I've
[16:21] been reading through Ezekiel it's been
[16:22] powerful I'm gonna Lord willing maybe
[16:24] I'll preach on Ezekiel pretty soon too
[16:25] it's been powerful just to see again wow
[16:27] all these things out of the scripture
[16:29] and the the creatures did you know where
[16:31] stomping preaching comes from it comes
[16:32] from Ezekiel God told Ezekiel stand
[16:35] there and stomp and cry out thus sayith
[16:37] the Lord where did The Stomping
[16:38] preachers come from
[16:40] Ezekiel it was really good I i' never
[16:43] seen that before just like uh where did
[16:45] the pulpit come from Ezra remember Ezra
[16:48] built a Pulpit and he stood up there all
[16:49] day when they finally got the walls
[16:51] built around in there rebuilt in
[16:52] Jerusalem was zable and he read the word
[16:54] of God all day and all the kids women
[16:56] and children everybody had to hear him
[16:58] read from the PO amen I like it I like
[17:00] to know where I originated from
[17:02] Hallelujah where did this Holy Ghost
[17:04] religion originate from right in the
[17:06] scripture hallelujah amen where the
[17:09] shout religion originate when the angels
[17:10] of God shouted for Joy when God founded
[17:13] the Earth Hallelujah we got the oldest
[17:15] shout religion is the oldest religion
[17:17] there is Glory see the soul thirsts and
[17:21] is Satisfied by coming to appear before
[17:24] God if you want to see me happy talk to
[17:27] me right after church
[17:29] right because that's what the Bible says
[17:31] my soul thirst for God When shall I
[17:32] appear before God verse three three my
[17:35] tears have been my meat day and night
[17:37] while they continue to say to me where
[17:38] is thy God when I remember these things
[17:40] I pour out my soul unto him so when I'm
[17:42] wondering Where's God and I need to I
[17:44] need to come and appear before God when
[17:46] we do that we come before God and we
[17:48] pour out our soul and our desire before
[17:51] God for I had gone with a multitude I
[17:54] went with them to the house of God with
[17:55] a voice of joy and praise with a
[17:57] multitude kept the holy day so remember
[18:00] three times a year the males were
[18:02] required to come to the the Tabernacle
[18:04] or the temple only three times a year
[18:06] see we got it good we get to come every
[18:07] week twice a week three times a week the
[18:09] Old Testament they didn't come that much
[18:12] What a Sad life that was amen but see we
[18:14] get to come before the house of God and
[18:16] so uh the writer would say my when we
[18:19] start traveling and we knew it was going
[18:20] to be the Sabbath we maybe on a Friday
[18:22] we start traveling we we we' meet more
[18:24] and more people going up to the house of
[18:26] God that's how we should feel when we
[18:27] come in here and shake hands like when I
[18:28] saw Austin I said Hey brother God bless
[18:30] you quick update you know God heard your
[18:32] prayers this week yes God heard your
[18:34] prayers I said glory to God right it
[18:36] makes you happy right this is what they
[18:37] experience in the physical so if you see
[18:39] somebody out in the parking lot makes
[18:41] you happy ah they made it back to the
[18:42] house of God hallelujah right that was
[18:45] just it was just a natural thing these
[18:47] things stir us up it makes us happy if
[18:50] they had in the Old Testament we should
[18:52] have much more in the New Testament
[18:53] praise God because better promises verse
[18:56] five why art thou cast down on my soul
[18:58] why as thou quieted me hope thou in God
[19:01] for yet I shall praise him for the help
[19:03] of his countenance see so why you cast
[19:06] down you know God's going to help you
[19:08] right and you know you'll yet praise God
[19:10] you know eventually this will pass and
[19:12] then I'll praise God again
[19:14] Hallelujah see but see the we got to
[19:17] slow down so our souls pants pants after
[19:20] God Longs for God and then we have to
[19:22] remember we'll be satisfied when we come
[19:25] to appear before God and we have joy
[19:27] with all of God's people
[19:29] people all right go to Psalm uh sorry
[19:32] Psalm 36 I'm sorry sorry Psalm 631
[19:34] forgive me I'm trying to go too fast
[19:36] Psalm 631 I got slow
[19:38] down a Psalm of David when he was in the
[19:41] word of Judah oh God Thou Art my God
[19:43] early will I seek thee my soul thirst is
[19:45] for thee my flesh longth for thee in a
[19:47] dry and thirsty land where no water is
[19:50] so he's in
[19:51] desperation so when we get in
[19:53] desperation that's when God's really
[19:55] going to show up right brother man
[19:57] preached a sermon 1963 desperation
[19:58] listen to it if you haven't done it you
[20:00] know brother goes through like all these
[20:01] Old Testament Bible characters every
[20:03] time they got desperate God showed up
[20:06] right uh Moses you know at the Red Sea
[20:08] they were desperate God showed up Israel
[20:11] needs to be changed he wrestled with God
[20:13] God showed up Hallelujah Noah got
[20:15] desperate God showed up and he finally
[20:17] sent the rain amen you know he goes
[20:19] through all the
[20:20] desperations that's what David says when
[20:22] I'm desperate I he said I'll seek you
[20:24] verse two to see thy power and their
[20:27] Glory as I've seen in My Sanctuary
[20:30] because now remember he would he saw it
[20:31] because he was a he was a writer so
[20:33] brother Austin while he was writing
[20:34] songs it would be in the church and he
[20:36] would prophesy when he got the song and
[20:39] that was power God stepped down and used
[20:42] my gift how many times are you Sayang
[20:43] brother the Holy Ghost fell right a
[20:45] couple times now it's been really
[20:46] wonderful right same thing with Malachi
[20:48] sing a song everybody I can hear your
[20:50] voices I'm like okay oh this is another
[20:51] level now worship you know right is it's
[20:54] it's God comes down we see his power
[20:56] like I like I knew when we prayed for
[20:57] Haven I knew God did something right
[20:59] there right I really felt that I
[21:01] remember I told her I said God heard
[21:02] your prayer I remember I told you that
[21:04] that's awesome to see that and I I don't
[21:06] I don't feel that all the time but
[21:07] there's times where you know God steps
[21:09] down I've seen his power Hallelujah I've
[21:11] seen him come down in the sanctuary
[21:13] Hallelujah right David longed for that
[21:17] because thy loving kindness is better
[21:18] than life my lip shall praise thee now
[21:20] remember he's out in the wilderness but
[21:22] he's remembering oh God I'm longing to
[21:24] feel you come down like you did in the
[21:26] sanctuary and I know you're full of love
[21:30] I know your love is greater than my life
[21:32] what I'm going through thus will I bless
[21:35] bless thee while I live I'll lift up my
[21:37] hands in thy name see we must thirst for
[21:40] his power and His glory and his past
[21:44] love motivates us to praise him now
[21:46] because we know he'll do it
[21:48] again amen he'll do it again Hallelujah
[21:52] now Psalm 84 is where I really want to
[21:53] get to Jesus speaks here I'm sorry yeah
[21:56] Jesus speaks also of sparrows but uh
[21:58] Psalm 84:1 to the chief musician upon
[22:02] GTH a psalm for the sons of Kora how
[22:05] amiable that means beautiful are thy
[22:07] Tabernacles oh lord of hosts now our
[22:10] church we got a pretty nice building
[22:11] here I don't know if we'd call it
[22:13] beautiful it's a nice brick building but
[22:15] it all depends how you look at it if you
[22:17] look at it as a House of healing or a
[22:18] house of power a house of God's glory
[22:21] then this is a beautiful place
[22:22] Hallelujah not so much the building but
[22:25] it's what God does there in the building
[22:28] he said my soul Longs yes even faints
[22:30] for the courts of the Lord my heart my
[22:32] flesh crith out for the Living God oh
[22:35] God you're alive oh God do something God
[22:37] we're here to worship you speak to us

[22:49] altars oh lord of hosts my king and my
[22:52] God so David would even see and these
[22:54] these workers they would see even birds
[22:57] make their nest in the literal the
[22:59] physical House of God and he remembers
[23:02] wow God and and he they let the birds
[23:05] stay there they didn't push the birds
[23:06] away from God's house they even let the
[23:08] birds hang around God's
[23:10] house they wanted the birds to be
[23:12] blessed Hallelujah right he said even
[23:15] the sparrow no so David was longing for
[23:17] the house of God he says yes even the
[23:19] sparrow has a house and and even they
[23:22] can kind of Roost around the altars of
[23:24] God blessed are they that dwell in thine

[25:11] walk to the temple or the Tabernacle and
[25:14] uh God as they're passing as they're
[25:15] walking God would send the rains and
[25:18] fill the pool so their animals had water

[26:16] glory they go from what strength to
[26:18] strength we should get stronger as we
[26:21] serve God every one of them in Zion
[26:24] appear before God right Zion yeah oh
[26:27] Lord God of hosts hear my prayer give
[26:29] ear oh god of Jacob say la behold oh God
[26:31] our shield and look upon the face of
[26:34] thine anointed so see I'm Anointed with
[26:36] praise I'm anointed God's made me happy
[26:38] I'm coming to the house of God the
[26:40] spirit of God is upon me
[26:42] Hallelujah behold oh God our shield and
[26:45] look upon the face of th anointed verse
[26:46] 10 for in for a day in thy course is a
[26:49] better than a
[26:51] thousand I'd rather be a doorkeeper in
[26:53] the house of my God than to dwell in the
[26:56] tents of the wicked
[26:58] so it's if someone tried to offer to to
[27:00] take you out to some drug house tonight
[27:02] or even a bar tonight and they gave you
[27:04] the choice of that watching the big game
[27:06] or whatever or or just opening the door
[27:10] right that was your only job just to
[27:11] open the door it'd be better just to
[27:13] open the door so the Saints can come in
[27:16] and they can be continually praising God
[27:19] hallelujah that one day the one day of
[27:21] just opening the door I remember when I
[27:23] first became a deacon at brother brother
[27:24] Brooks's church I was so happy it was
[27:27] like the happiest thing my life just to
[27:28] open the door for all these saints come
[27:30] on into the church I I took such joy in
[27:32] it it was such a privilege because
[27:34] before when I was younger I never wanted
[27:35] to go to church but now I get to open
[27:37] the doors and let the moms and the dads
[27:39] the children come on in and praise the
[27:41] Lord I must have been the happiest
[27:42] Deacon there was there it was such a joy
[27:45] because I used to not want to go into
[27:47] the church but now it's my duty open the
[27:49] doors for the house of God it was a joy
[27:52] it still is a joy
[27:54] amen it's better to be in the house of
[27:56] God one day than a thousand and
[27:58] elsewhere right so one day is better
[28:00] than three years out in the Wicked with
[28:01] the wicked right one day is so much
[28:05] greater this day today is a great day
[28:08] Hallelujah you should feel happy about
[28:09] today Hallelujah almost every morning
[28:11] Zion comes in sits on my lap he said
[28:13] Daddy is this a church day is this a is
[28:16] this a morning church or night church
[28:17] day I said it's a night church day today
[28:20] buddy because that's kind of how they or
[28:22] think of their lives right all their
[28:23] lives revolve around coming to church
[28:26] that's rightly so Hallelujah
[28:29] but notice uh he speaks of the sparrow I
[28:31] want to just look at the Sparrow real
[28:32] quick the in the Bible the sparrow
[28:34] symbolizes God's care and attention to
[28:37] even the smallest seemingly
[28:39] insignificant
[28:41] Creature if God will let a little
[28:44] Sparrow dwell in his house and be
[28:47] blessed and not push him away how much
[28:49] more does God care about you and
[28:52] I Hallelujah Jesus talks about this uh
[28:56] in Matthew 10 he says are not too
[28:58] sparrows sold for a penny yet not one of
[29:00] them will fall to the ground outside of
[29:02] your father's care so you know if God
[29:04] sees a little Sparrow a little tiny Bird
[29:06] fall down God sees when you fall down
[29:10] and if God no notices that bird God
[29:13] notices all your moves as
[29:15] well Hallelujah this is God trying to
[29:19] remind us of how important and Jesus
[29:21] even says you are more valuable than a
[29:25] sparrow right what an encouragement to
[29:28] remember how valuable you are in the
[29:30] sight of
[29:32] God
[29:34] hallelujah he Jesus even said in Luke 12
[29:37] yet not one of them is forgotten by God
[29:39] God remembers and feeds that little
[29:42] Sparrow or those those barn swallows you
[29:45] see in the barns right God feeds them
[29:47] how much more is he going to feed us I'm
[29:50] talking about spiritual and natural
[29:52] right we need natural no doubt but
[29:53] spiritual as well so see sparrows remind
[29:56] us that God's care is always on the
[30:00] little things and also on
[30:03] us even in our moments of struggle when
[30:06] they when we might feel unnoticed like
[30:08] we might see we might seem so little in
[30:10] the mind of God well how could God care
[30:12] about me I'm a little or nothing I'm
[30:13] this or that but yet Jesus says God does
[30:16] notice you and God knows the hairs on
[30:18] your head
[30:20] Hallelujah so the sparrow represents
[30:22] God's detailed knowledge and his loving
[30:25] provision and uh conveys us message of
[30:28] comfort and reassurance about his
[30:30] unwavering presence and the value of
[30:33] your life am
[30:36] Hallelujah God lets the
[30:38] sparrow like we heard that beautiful
[30:40] song on Sunday I I've been singing that
[30:41] song all day yesterday and that Sparrow
[30:44] song Hallelujah such a such a wonderful
[30:47] song The Sparrow found a house I found a
[30:50] house I found the house of God
[30:53] hallelujah and I will dwell in the house
[30:55] of God all the days of my life
[30:57] Hallelujah that's one thing I've desired
[30:59] Hallelujah to dwell in the house of the
[31:01] Lord all the days of my life look at uh
[31:03] Psalm 8411 for the Lord th God is a sun
[31:07] and shield you all know without the sun
[31:08] there's no life so God's saying I'm your
[31:12] life and and see connects it to going to
[31:14] worship uh hungering and thirsting after
[31:17] God longing for God so see God's going
[31:20] to water us if we go get the
[31:22] water right Hallelujah we see we see it
[31:26] God's a son and he's a shield
[31:28] so God is shining his power upon us but
[31:31] God's also a shield right against all
[31:33] the darts of the
[31:35] enemy praise God he's my son he's my
[31:38] light he's my heat he's my strength he's
[31:40] my health but he's also my shield to
[31:43] stop Every Lie of
[31:46] Satan the Lord will give Grace and Glory
[31:49] now look at this church no good thing
[31:51] everybody say no good thing ready no
[31:53] good thing will he withhold from them
[31:55] that walk uprightly so whatever you have
[31:58] have it's a good thing Austin got a good
[31:59] thing when you got married brother so
[32:01] did
[32:02] I we all did that right when we got
[32:04] married God gave us good things
[32:06] Hallelujah and even our jobs and you
[32:09] know uh our children and our family and
[32:12] and our influence you know all these
[32:14] things God give to us they're all good
[32:15] things so if we don't have something yet
[32:18] God's either planning to give it to us
[32:20] or we got to change our desire for the
[32:21] will of God right because he said he
[32:25] will not withhold it in other words
[32:27] he'll give you everything that's good he
[32:30] said he'll work everything for good
[32:32] Hallelujah he's talking about going to
[32:34] church right he's going about worshiping
[32:35] he's talking about worshiping God going
[32:38] getting stronger and stronger Glory
[32:39] going up to the house of God getting
[32:41] stronger stronger uh being blessed
[32:44] continually praising God God promises
[32:46] I'll give you everything that's good for
[32:50] you verse 12 oh lord of hosts blessed is
[32:54] a man that trusts in thee like that song
[32:58] uh brother Nia requested that song on
[33:00] Sunday night I trust in God my savior
[33:03] Hallelujah I like that said brother Nia
[33:04] what song do you want to sing brother he
[33:06] said trust in God I said amen
[33:10] hallelujah I like
[33:12] that so see we get this uh look at this
[33:15] encouragement from the scripture
[33:17] here about how God sees us see he if he
[33:21] if he takes care of the sparrow the
[33:23] littlest tiniest little bird then surely
[33:25] he'll take care of us
[33:28] you know Sparrow I was looking at a few
[33:30] scientific facts that they don't have a
[33:32] a big chance to live that's why there's
[33:34] so many they have so many little babies
[33:37] uh I think only like four out of 10
[33:38] survive you know within a few
[33:41] years they're just so small and they
[33:44] they're easy prey you know for Predators
[33:46] but yet God knows about each and every
[33:48] one of them God knows about what we need
[33:50] God knows what we're going to go through
[33:52] God's already provided in advance he
[33:54] knows what we need and he said just ask
[33:56] me for it I'll go I'll do it for you
[33:58] I'll give it to you Hallelujah just ask
[34:00] cuz I'm not going to withhold anything
[34:02] that's good from your life Hallelujah
[34:04] well I need more miracles God's got it
[34:06] for you amen if if it's God's will right
[34:09] I need more power I need more witnesses
[34:11] or I need more testimony whatever God
[34:13] will God will give it to you if you uh
[34:15] draw nigh to God God will draw nigh to
[34:18] you Hallelujah he takes care of the
[34:21] sparrow he takes care of you and I we're
[34:24] more valuable Church than sparrows
[34:26] Hallelujah I want to read a few quotes
[34:29] about where brother Ram cites Isaiah 27
[34:31] I read a few last
[34:34] week brother ramam says he says uh God
[34:37] interprets his own word he said I am the
[34:40] Lord I planted it I water it day and
[34:42] night lest some should pluck it from my
[34:45] hand he said another scripture he
[34:47] watched over his word to perform it now
[34:49] this is what I liked perform it reveal
[34:52] it to his elected to those that it sent
[34:54] to see that sent to see it rather he
[34:57] performs it to those who are sent to see
[35:00] it he watches over it keeps it away from
[35:03] all the foolish carnal interpretations
[35:05] he says that's right he said that's
[35:07] right that's right God God is right
[35:08] God's identified person all them
[35:11] Pharisees could have stood up and said
[35:12] we're of God we have the laws we have
[35:14] this and there stood the word itself
[35:16] said away with it crucify it it don't
[35:19] identify itself with what we believe but
[35:21] Jesus identified himself with the word
[35:24] and those who had eyes to see saw it
[35:26] those who were blind mind did not see it
[35:30] okay so what I want to draw to here is
[35:31] that God keeps his word away from the
[35:34] fools in other words God's not going to
[35:36] water them because they don't want the
[35:38] water right and God identifies his
[35:41] person and in this day God didn't
[35:43] identify or Roberts or Kenneth copen as
[35:46] a genuine prophet of God God identified
[35:49] William brandom
[35:50] Hallelujah right William brandham was
[35:52] the one that said uh thus sayith the
[35:54] Lord this nation is going to go
[35:55] completely insane brother brandom said
[35:57] that
[35:58] and look what look what happened to
[36:00] him I mean that was a prophet of God
[36:04] none of these other guys said anything
[36:05] like that they don't even get close to
[36:07] saying anything like that and God will
[36:10] perform his word you and I just must put
[36:12] our faith in the word of God because God
[36:15] will back it
[36:16] up all right let's read them uh Jeremiah
[36:19] 1 11 and 12 moreover the word of the
[36:21] Lord came unto me saying Jeremiah what
[36:23] seest thou and I said I see a rod of an
[36:25] almond tree then said the Lord unto me
[36:28] thou Hast seen well for I will hasten my
[36:30] word to perform it okay so when God was
[36:34] dealing with the prophet God said here's
[36:36] a symbol of an almond tree I'm going to
[36:38] perform this so I just want you to see
[36:41] this there's times there's times God
[36:43] lets promises linger but then God says
[36:45] but now there's a time I'm going to
[36:46] perform that word right he promised to
[36:49] wat us day and night but brother brings
[36:51] us out he all he takes a time where he
[36:53] performs the word of
[36:55] God hallelujah
[36:57] Ezekiel 25 I'm sorry Ezekiel 12:25 he
[37:00] says almost the same thing to Ezekiel
[37:02] for I am the Lord I will speak and the
[37:04] word that I shall speak shall come to
[37:06] pass it shall be no more prolonged for
[37:09] in your days o rebellious house will I
[37:11] say the word and will perform it saith
[37:14] the Lord God hallelujah so that's what
[37:17] God did in brother Ram's ministry right
[37:19] God performed Luke 17:30 in brother
[37:21] Ram's Ministry a son of man a prophet
[37:23] Ministry God performed uh revelation
[37:26] 10:7 God finished the mysteries of God
[37:29] hallelujah amen God performed it now
[37:33] what are we looking for what what
[37:34] performance are we looking for well
[37:36] we're looking for the finishing of the
[37:38] Great
[37:38] Commission right we're looking for the
[37:40] message through the internet unless we
[37:42] become missionaries we're looking for
[37:44] the internet or to send missionaries to
[37:46] take the gospel to people that have
[37:47] never heard it like Junction City Saints
[37:51] Hallelujah right or God to send us out
[37:54] like God sent Austin out to get the
[37:56] elect seed sister Lena
[37:58] Hallelujah right God had to send him out
[38:00] there to bring the elect seed to him
[38:03] because God knows where his children are
[38:05] Hallelujah see that's what we're seeing
[38:07] we're seeing God finishing the Great
[38:09] Commission that's what we're seeing now
[38:11] the main thing we're looking for is
[38:12] rapturing Faith right okay but we know
[38:16] God has to finish all he he he will
[38:19] perform his word
[38:21] hallelujah now one more First Kings 611
[38:25] First Kings 611 you're really fast there
[38:26] Cas good job and the word Lord came to
[38:28] Solomon saying concerning this house
[38:30] which Thou Art building if thou will
[38:32] walk in my statutes and execute my
[38:34] judgments and keep all of my
[38:36] Commandments to walk in them then will I
[38:38] perform my word with thee which I spake
[38:41] unto David thy father and I will dwell
[38:44] among the children of Israel and will
[38:45] not forsake My People
[38:48] Israel so see this is when God performs
[38:51] his word when we obey the word of God if
[38:53] we can just obey the word of God then
[38:55] God will perform it but remember first
[38:58] of all it's got to be a revelation
[38:59] that's a verse for
[39:01] you right my we were listening to a
[39:03] sermon last night and the preacher said
[39:04] A good sermon until he just said a few
[39:05] things he said uh he said any positive
[39:08] mental attitude toward any promise of
[39:10] God will bring it to pass and Haven said
[39:11] no it's got to be the will of God and I
[39:14] said amen sister
[39:15] Haven right because remember think about
[39:18] think about Paul you know he had that
[39:21] eye trouble and the demons were
[39:22] buffeting a a positive mental attitude
[39:25] wasn't going to wasn't going to take
[39:27] that away Jesus allowed that to Humble
[39:29] him right now eventually God probably
[39:31] did but we're talking about God's
[39:33] perfect will we have to know the will of
[39:36] God hallelujah so if God reveals
[39:38] something to us it's his will then we
[39:40] know we just got to wait on it and then
[39:42] God will perform it hallelujah it's like
[39:46] I told you that brother who prayed 10
[39:47] years to have a church in akan God
[39:49] finally performed it and look where we
[39:50] was stand in 18 years we been standing
[39:52] on the word of God now that's that's
[39:54] that's awesome to me Hallelujah I mean
[39:57] wouldn't Lena like a a message church
[39:59] right in there in Lake havu wouldn't she
[40:00] like that it' take a real work of God
[40:02] wouldn't it it'd have to be the will of
[40:05] God because you got to find labors who
[40:07] are willing to
[40:08] labor right so see see how Supernatural
[40:11] it is just to have a church in acan It's
[40:14] Supernatural and this whole time he's
[40:16] sitting right there at Kenmore walking
[40:18] up and down the streets of Kenmore why
[40:20] am I in akan or you know I'm going to
[40:22] the SAR
[40:23] someday right you are brother Hallelujah
[40:27] see God God has to perform his word
[40:32] hallelujah and I want to just encourage
[40:34] the church with this brother R says in
[40:36] uh spiritual food and du season
[40:39] 1965 brother's talking about he's
[40:41] closing the sermon and he's talking
[40:42] about when he first established the
[40:44] brandham Tabernacle and they said when
[40:46] it came up the people of the city said
[40:48] within the space of six months this will
[40:51] be a
[40:54] garage he said we had $180
[40:57] to build a tabernacle a lot of the
[40:59] garbage people done decided it was going
[41:01] to be I'm sorry a lot of the garage
[41:03] people decided it was going to be their
[41:04] garage but it's still a sheep pen for
[41:07] God's
[41:08] sheep he says now I the Lord have
[41:11] planted it I will water it day and night
[41:13] L some lest some should pluck it up from
[41:15] my hand look at the criticism no
[41:18] denomination to back up as church and
[41:20] who do we got to back us up nobody we
[41:23] got a denomination backing us up no sir
[41:26] right we got heaven backing us up he
[41:29] says there's no churches like ours
[41:31] around the country here no Pentecost in
[41:33] the country nothing else will sustain it
[41:35] everybody against the water baptism
[41:37] everybody against all these things even
[41:39] to my own family my own daddy turned me
[41:41] away from the
[41:42] door
[41:44] Hallelujah I I got my clothes in a
[41:47] little paper sack and went and lived in
[41:48] New Albany right but through many
[41:50] dangersous toils and snares I have
[41:53] already come it's grace that brought me
[41:55] this far and it's Grace he he said I'm
[41:57] 56 years old I'm soon got the cross over
[41:59] the river and Grace will lead me home he
[42:03] says he's talking about God taking the
[42:06] Tabernacle when everybody was against it
[42:08] and they were still against it and yet
[42:10] God promised he uses Isaiah 27 to show
[42:13] God's going to water us day and night if
[42:15] we just drink the water God will sustain
[42:18] us hallelujah has haven't we seen that
[42:20] my wife have we seen that for 18 years
[42:22] God has sustained us for 18 years never
[42:24] once I've ever been disappointed coming
[42:26] to church
[42:27] right because each time I leave here
[42:29] happy joyful like I said talk to me if
[42:30] you want to see me happy talk to me
[42:31] after church Hallelujah that's what the
[42:33] Bible said you'll be continually pray
[42:35] you'll be
[42:37] blessed right we can all look at our
[42:39] lives we're more blessed to serve God
[42:41] we're so blessed to come to God's house
[42:44] if we miss it's like we're
[42:46] cursed right if we if we if we just you
[42:49] know not not us necessarily but people
[42:51] that won't come to church they they have
[42:53] to feel cursed right they feel far away
[42:55] from God that's what yeah brother Austin
[42:56] told me that remember on your testimony
[42:58] you said you knew as soon as you left
[42:59] church it would never be the same till
[43:00] you got back right you wouldn't be real
[43:03] really blessed till you got back and
[43:04] wasn't that the truth brother that was a
[43:06] thought that was a good thought right
[43:07] there that's a really good thought
[43:09] because that's what the Bible says they
[43:10] that dwell in the courts of God will be
[43:13] blessed brother ra said look we can
[43:15] apply we can apply Isaiah 27 to our own
[43:18] little church God will keep feeding us
[43:21] he won't abandon us he won't leave us
[43:23] alone he'll always water us he'll always
[43:26] keep us he'll protect us nobody can hurt
[43:28] the Gospel of Jesus
[43:32] Christ he says it again the next month
[43:34] and knowth it not 1965 he's praying dear
[43:37] Jesus actually this is the beginning of
[43:38] the sermon we're grateful for the
[43:40] privilege that we have of assembling
[43:42] together here how many grateful
[43:44] especially after covid right really
[43:45] grateful and oh as I looked upon the
[43:47] Tabernacle early this morning after
[43:49] midnight I passed by I thought of how
[43:52] you have stood by it so every time I
[43:54] come to this church I thank God lord how
[43:56] you how have you stood by our little
[44:00] church he said I think of the Old Pond
[44:03] that was here so Bram Tabernacle we were
[44:05] there this summer there used to be a
[44:06] pond right there girls there was a
[44:09] pond he said there was a pond there big
[44:11] old weed standing up right about where
[44:13] this pulpits at as the little boy I
[44:15] stood here Mr Ingram said we could have
[44:17] the lot for just a little money and pay
[44:19] something down and no money no
[44:20] collateral no nothing to offer but to
[44:22] try it so see we know God if God wants
[44:24] us to have a building God will open up
[44:26] the same thing like them they had no
[44:27] money they they were a very poor Church
[44:29] they had $180 brother
[44:32] Austin but see God put it on their the
[44:34] man's heart I'll give you this no
[44:36] interest you can just buy it see that's
[44:38] when I know God won want us to build a
[44:39] church or buy a church when it's
[44:43] supernatural right when it's just a
[44:44] right deal like remember cam remember
[44:46] cam story about getting that car what my
[44:47] wife was just talking about remember cam
[44:49] cam drove that was it
[44:50] explore okay so he was he prayed
[44:52] beforehand Lord give me give me favor if
[44:54] if you want if you want me to have this
[44:56] vehicle for my grown family when he got
[44:58] there the guy I think what was it like
[45:00] 10,000 okay it's like 10,000 Cam's like
[45:02] okay praise the Lord cam didn't even ask
[45:04] him to take it down he's like you know
[45:04] what let's I'll sell it for nine cam
[45:08] keeps talking to him by the time they're
[45:09] done talking the guy's like I'll give it
[45:11] to you for five and cam didn't have to
[45:14] ask or beg right God just that is
[45:18] Supernatural like if God wants you to
[45:20] have something he'll withhold no good
[45:22] thing from you and I hallelujah amen see
[45:25] we don't want to push and try to be
[45:26] selfish and try to do things our way we
[45:28] got to let God open things up Hallelujah
[45:30] we got to let God bless us but then we
[45:32] got to be patient at the same time
[45:35] because it can't come in my time and
[45:36] season it's got to come in God's time
[45:37] and
[45:40] season he
[45:43] says he says and then as a fullface
[45:46] value was a little over $2,000 boy I
[45:48] wish I could buy a property for
[45:49] $2,000 with 20 years to pay it out what
[45:52] a loan 20 years no
[45:54] interest that's how you know it was God
[45:57] he said and now Lord he's praying now
[45:58] Lord look at it now and while it was in
[46:01] its infancy still sitting in a hole here
[46:04] water pouring into it how that you
[46:06] promise US by the word so brother had
[46:08] some Vision on the night of the the on
[46:10] on the day they laid the the the the
[46:12] Cornerstone he quotes Isaiah 27 I the
[46:16] Lord have planted it I'll Water it day
[46:17] and night lest some pluck it up out of
[46:19] my hands the same time the people said
[46:21] within 6 months it'll be turned into a
[46:23] garage but literally thousands of souls
[46:26] have have found Christ at this altar
[46:28] we've had a few by God's grace I'll take
[46:30] whatever God sends us hallelujah and the
[46:34] Tabernacle the baptistry has constantly
[46:36] had people been baptized in the name of
[46:38] the Lord Jesus Calling upon his name
[46:40] washing away their sins hundreds of
[46:42] crippled Afflicted blind Hal lame
[46:44] cancere eaten have walked away from this
[46:46] platform come and dying men and women
[46:48] boys and girls and gone out to live a
[46:50] new life with a new flesh on their
[46:52] bodies walking again leave the
[46:54] wheelchairs crutches and so forth oh God
[46:56] this 30 years of service Father I
[46:59] remember the morning we laid the
[47:00] Cornerstone and you gave me the vision
[47:02] over there showing the place packed and
[47:04] jammed a beautiful corner I knew that
[47:06] that could not fail so I thank you for
[47:09] all these things
[47:12] Hallelujah see the thing to do is
[47:14] remember if God's called you to
[47:15] something God will give you a vision for
[47:17] it and God won't withhold anything good
[47:20] from you and you just have to take you
[47:21] have to take confidence that Isaiah 27
[47:24] is the vision for your life too God's
[47:27] going to water me God's going to protect
[47:29] me God's going to keep me and he's going
[47:30] to do it every moment hallelujah
[47:35] amen I didn't set the timer but I know
[47:37] it's almost 8 o'clock all
[47:42] right
[47:45] Hallelujah now I want to uh go a few
[47:47] more thoughts here now uh last week I
[47:49] mentioned the former lad of rain but I
[47:50] just want to go a little bit deeper on
[47:52] this here I believe we're still getting
[47:54] watered by the former rain
[47:57] now that might seem shange to people uh
[47:59] strange but brother ad's Ministry he
[48:01] calls it the former Reign the latter
[48:03] Reign is rapturing
[48:04] Faith okay now people will definitely
[48:08] totally disagree I know preachers I've
[48:09] heard them already preach I know they'll
[48:10] disagree with me that's fine they can
[48:12] believe whatever they want I'm going to
[48:13] believe whatever I want because I see it
[48:14] in the word of God this this makes more
[48:16] sense than anything
[48:18] else because we're still learning the
[48:20] message somebody raise up on the
[48:22] internet and tell me you understand all
[48:24] the
[48:25] message that's the only way that the for
[48:27] that the former Reign would be over
[48:29] you've learned
[48:30] everything who's learned everything in
[48:32] the message if you are now you learned
[48:35] you learned the wrong thing you learned
[48:37] Pride you see what I mean like it's a
[48:39] teaching the the the the Greek I'm sorry
[48:41] the Hebrew word in Joel 2 is Mora which
[48:44] means teaching Reign right and then
[48:47] comes the Harvest rign which brother
[48:48] calls rapturing Faith so see God is
[48:51] still watering us teaching us to believe
[48:54] the word of God remind aren't you glad
[48:57] he reminds us that Jesus is still on the
[48:58] throne like on Sunday and aren't you
[49:00] glad he reminded you faith is your
[49:02] Victory how many get victory over that
[49:04] Temptation how many going to get victory
[49:06] over this situation faith will give you
[49:08] the victory and it's not your faith it's
[49:10] the gift of God of faith that Christ
[49:13] gave you it's the faith of the Son of
[49:16] God see that's why brother Ram called
[49:18] his ministry the teaching Reign we're
[49:20] still learning to walk under the
[49:22] anointing of the Holy Ghost we're still
[49:24] learning the message
[49:27] and I'll say like this no one is
[49:28] Anointed with rapturing faith right now
[49:30] because no one's being
[49:31] raptured now church I know this I know
[49:34] remember I read Romans 8 a few weeks ago
[49:36] if you're already Justified then you're
[49:38] already glorified I know the Rapture is
[49:40] already in you right I know the Rapture
[49:42] is already in me but there's a special
[49:45] anointing that falls for rapturing Faith
[49:47] everybody knows that if that wasn't the
[49:48] case if we already had rapturing faith
[49:50] in us who wouldn't speak themselves into
[49:52] a Rapture
[49:53] already if you had that ability
[49:56] right the potentials are in you the
[49:58] promises in you the the seed the seeg
[50:01] gene of God to that will produce it is
[50:03] in you but you need a special Reign
[50:06] that's why the Bible said former and
[50:08] latter
[50:09] reain and message royalty I'll say like
[50:12] Billy Paul these are men are dying but
[50:15] more people are dying no one's being
[50:16] raptured so how can rapturing Faith be
[50:19] here if everybody's
[50:20] dying right and other message royalty
[50:24] families like big names big names around
[50:26] the message all their family members are
[50:27] dying no one's being raptured so how can
[50:30] rapturing Faith be here the rapturing
[50:33] faith is the anointing for the body
[50:35] change and I'll say like this false
[50:38] doctrines among message Believers prove
[50:40] they still need the former
[50:43] rain and I know I kind of get less amens
[50:45] on that because it's I'm more dealing
[50:46] with the needs out there and you
[50:48] everybody gets loudest when I'm dealing
[50:49] with the needs in here so I'm I'm just
[50:50] making a point okay so you understand
[50:53] for
[50:54] example The Junction City saying sa need
[50:57] the former
[50:59] Reign because they just came in the
[51:02] message that's why I tried to lay in
[51:04] there on 17
[51:05] trips right laying there just the
[51:07] foundation don't don't the last one I I
[51:10] said the Bible's the absolute not
[51:11] brother Bram brother bram's poin to the
[51:13] absolute the absolute means all powerful
[51:15] that's Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the
[51:17] absolute see they need that they need
[51:19] that teaching they need the anointing so
[51:23] they don't get a a seducing Spirit to
[51:25] pull them away from the church
[51:27] truth the the former rain is still
[51:30] falling in my humble opinion Hallelujah
[51:32] I see it falling amen I and if church
[51:36] and if time goes on we'll continue to
[51:37] see it fall on them so they don't fall
[51:39] into these false doctrines like
[51:41] Prosperity stuff and worship in the
[51:43] tapes and Joseph bram's a prophet all
[51:44] these false doctrines they won't fall
[51:46] into that because they're getting the
[51:47] reign of the holy spirit for teaching
[51:53] Hallelujah just like I needed the former
[51:55] Reign back in 200 1 in 2002 my wife
[51:57] knows boy did I need the teaching rain I
[51:59] need somebody to teach me to cut my hair
[52:01] I need somebody teach me to stop being
[52:03] addicted to chewing tobacco and dirty
[52:05] movies and all these kind of things and
[52:06] sports don't worship Sports as Idols I
[52:08] need a lot of teaching rain thank God it
[52:10] fell
[52:12] Hallelujah so remember church this rain
[52:15] is still falling God promised to teach
[52:17] you if you just have a learner's
[52:20] Heart Right Jesus said come and learn of
[52:22] me he said but I'm meek and lowly of
[52:25] heart he's real humble right he'll he'll
[52:28] teach you if you're willing to humble
[52:30] yourself
[52:32] hallelujah oh it's so true so true now
[52:36] I'm going to the thought where in uh
[52:38] Isaiah 27:2 he said it'll be like red
[52:41] wine so Israel when it's water day and
[52:43] night it's going to produce wine we are
[52:45] water day and night we have the wine of
[52:47] stimulation of
[52:48] Revelation Hallelujah so in other words
[52:51] if something can preach made you joyful
[52:54] that was stimulation you had some wine
[52:56] on Sunday
[52:57] is anybody guilty of drinking spiritual
[52:59] wine on Sunday I hope so I saw some
[53:02] people crying that was good I saw some
[53:04] people shouting I was shouting I shout
[53:07] so much my throat really hurt on Monday
[53:09] amen shouting too much I felt like I
[53:12] told the family I felt like I preached
[53:13] on Sunday night I was like oh my
[53:14] goodness I said so many
[53:18] amens I felt good and that that's what
[53:21] God promised to do to give you wine to
[53:24] give you revelation
[53:26] right so you can understand the things
[53:28] of God uh our uh our wine is the Holy
[53:32] Ghost acts 213 said others said these
[53:34] men are full of new wine but Peter stood
[53:37] up and said uh verse 15 but these are
[53:40] not drunken as you suppose seeing it's a
[53:42] third hour of the day but this is that
[53:44] which was spoken by the prophet Joel
[53:47] Glory I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[53:49] Flesh
[53:51] Hallelujah now brother Ram says in the
[53:54] third seal brother Ram's preaching on
[53:56] the oil and wine now Revelation 66 is
[53:58] the third seal and I Heard a Voice in
[54:00] the midst of the four Beast say a
[54:01] measure of wheat for a penny remember
[54:03] the Catholic church was going to capture
[54:05] the wealth of the
[54:06] world and three measures of barley for a
[54:09] penny and see thou hurt not the oil and
[54:12] the
[54:14] wine okay so brother Ram reads his
[54:16] scripture and he says he says you hear
[54:18] me say I feel religious that's what's
[54:20] the matter the simulation is so bad just
[54:23] about ready to go cutting up you know
[54:25] simul ation from Revelation did you know
[54:28] whenever you feel like dancing or
[54:30] shouting or something brother ram calls
[54:31] that cutting up I'm just going to cut up
[54:34] a little bit and praise God I just feel
[54:36] so joyful about the word of
[54:38] God hallelujah sorry L if I'm clapping
[54:41] too
[54:42] loud that that's
[54:44] better but when when you just feel so
[54:46] joyful you got to like let out a shout
[54:48] Or Glory or
[54:51] Hallelujah butam said you're feeling
[54:53] religious you're stimulated by the wine
[54:59] Hallelujah he said they on the day of
[55:01] Pentecost they became so stimulated by
[55:03] Revelation that they Vindicated the
[55:05] promise of
[55:07] Joel and that's what we need we need to
[55:09] get so simulated so we vindicate some
[55:11] promise of God in here like lay hands on
[55:15] the sick they shall recover cast out
[55:17] Devils if someone comes in here demon
[55:19] possessed Hallelujah get so stimulated
[55:23] to you're you're revelated to vindicate
[55:25] the word of of
[55:27] God that's what say oh I love this this
[55:30] is so beautiful he said oh my they broke
[55:33] out the joy of simulation till the
[55:35] people said they're drunk on new wine
[55:37] when God revealed his promise to them
[55:39] and not only did he reveal it but he
[55:41] proved it
[55:44] Hallelujah now brother gets into the
[55:47] third
[55:48] seal and he says he says in other words
[55:51] like this Jesus is saying if you catch
[55:53] some of my little flock that's filled
[55:55] with oil wine of the oil of the pure
[55:58] word and you're going to kill them now
[56:00] remember he's talking to the the Dark
[56:01] Ages because it was the it was the Black
[56:03] Horse and you're going to kill them
[56:06] you're doing that that's what you're
[56:07] doing don't you force them to say any
[56:10] hail mares or anything like that or some
[56:12] of your Creeds you keep your hands off
[56:14] them they know where they're going for
[56:16] they're Anointed with my oil and by
[56:19] being Anointed with my oil they have the
[56:21] wine of Joy because they know the word
[56:24] of my promise I'm going to raise them up
[56:27] again am brother R said Jesus said don't
[56:30] hurt that don't try to go messing with
[56:33] them just keep away from them Hallelujah
[56:36] so there's that same idea of hurting
[56:39] Isaiah 273 said nothing will hurt them
[56:43] and here in the New Testament Jesus says
[56:45] nothing will hurt your oil and wine
[56:48] remember it's like that it's that
[56:49] scripture says whatever you receive
[56:52] whatever you whatever you get in church
[56:54] it'll never be taken from you amen that
[56:57] ought to make it so wonderful to come to
[56:59] church that we know if God speaks
[57:00] something to my heart it'll never be
[57:02] taken from me praise God hallelujah
[57:05] that's the it can't be hurt it can't be
[57:08] taken away nobody can take your joy away
[57:11] nobody can take your Victory away
[57:13] because it's god-given and the Gates of
[57:15] Hell cannot Prevail against the wine of
[57:17] the Holy
[57:19] Spirit
[57:21] Hallelujah Simon preached on this years
[57:23] ago right here at this Pulpit he called
[57:25] it the the healing
[57:27] prescription out of Luke chap 10: 33 but
[57:31] a certain Samaritan as he journeyed come
[57:32] from where he was and when he saw him he
[57:34] had compassion on him and he went to him
[57:37] and bound up his wounds pouring in oil
[57:39] and
[57:40] wine and set him on his own beast and
[57:43] brought him to an inn and took care of
[57:44] him and on the marrow when he departed
[57:46] he took out two pence and gave that to
[57:48] the host and said him take care of him
[57:50] and whatso thou spendest more when I
[57:52] come again I'll repay thee so the the
[57:55] the illustration is Jesus finds US half
[57:58] dead out in the world isn't that where
[58:00] he found us I've been listening to your
[58:03] testimony that's like a lot like mine
[58:05] Jesus found me at a low spot I was half
[58:08] dead and he pours in oil he pours in the
[58:10] Holy Spirit he pours in wine simulation
[58:13] he puts you on his own power he puts you
[58:16] on the Beast right he puts you on his
[58:17] power he carries you to an end and
[58:20] brother Ram says the end is your pastor
[58:22] and the home
[58:24] church so Jesus didn't just pour an oil
[58:27] wine and say okay now offend for
[58:28] yourself you don't have to go to church
[58:30] now just press play and
[58:32] Obey no he said he took him to an end
[58:36] and then Jesus gave the pastor two pence
[58:39] how many know what brother Braham said
[58:41] that was brother ra said that was spirit
[58:44] and truth of ma of John chapter
[58:47] 4:24
[58:50] Hallelujah brother ramam
[58:52] said he says you Shepherds God give you
[58:55] the spirit and the word to take care of
[58:57] those wounded ones that's been brought
[58:58] in if you need if you need any more
[59:00] he'll take care of that when he comes so
[59:03] just feed those sheep church that's all
[59:05] I'm trying to do every time I come here
[59:07] just feed you the word of God I know the
[59:09] word has life I know if you worship
[59:11] you'll be blessed Hallelujah I know if
[59:13] you continually praise God God will
[59:15] anoint you Hallelujah this word is
[59:17] spirit and it's life
[59:19] hallelujah
[59:22] amen brother BR says again you that
[59:24] raise your hand and want to be further
[59:26] LED towards the Lord I ask you to go
[59:28] down he said to the Revival tonight and
[59:30] I'm sure the pastor there would take you
[59:32] from here to the end he has a six pence
[59:35] brother man says in that case this Good
[59:36] Samaritan was the pastor he said he has
[59:38] a six pence or whatever was given to
[59:40] take care oil and wine to pour in he can
[59:44] finish the job so in other words brother
[59:46] R had confidence in the five-fold
[59:48] ministry the five-fold ministry will
[59:49] give you the spirit and the word and
[59:52] that will finish the job Hallelujah God
[59:55] will provide God's going to water you
