[0:00] 8 verse 65.
[0:10] And I'll try to I'll try to preach kind
[0:12] of short tonight. Um
[0:15] Malachi Rod gets up at 3:50 or 3:45 a.m.
[0:18] So I'm trying to shorten my sermons so
[0:20] we can get home a little sooner by God's
[0:22] grace.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, that's right. That's right.
[0:26] Hallelujah. God bless you.
[0:30] and you did it faithfully for decades,
[0:32] brother. So, God bless you richly. Psalm
[0:35] 78 uh 65. Now, here's a beautiful
[0:39] scripture here, and we saw it on Sunday.
[0:43] God wakes up when you wake up.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; God will wake up in your life when you
[0:50] wake up in your life.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse 65. Let's read that on
[0:55] three. Ready? One, two, three. Then the
[0:57] Lord awaken as one out of sleep and like
[1:01] a mighty man that shoutth by reason of
[1:05] wine. May the Lord add his blessing to
[1:07] the ring of his word. You may be seated.
[1:09] I'm going to take or I'm going to take
[1:11] my liberty here and try to preach about
[1:13] 45 minutes if that's possible. So
[1:16] hallelujah. Now, we know this is about
[1:18] David because later later on down in
[1:20] verse uh uh
[1:24] 68, he talks about choosing the tribe of
[1:26] Judah. And then in verse uh 70, he chose
[1:29] David from that tribe. Hallelujah. And
[1:31] then he fed the people of God. And I
[1:33] love verse 72. How many enjoyed that
[1:35] preaching on integrity on Sunday? Verse
[1:37] 72. For he fed them according to the
[1:39] integrity of his heart. Integrity means
[1:42] innocence. In other words, obedience.
[1:45] Hallelujah. And God will honor a man or
[1:48] woman who lives in integrity. I just
[1:50] read it again in Job uh 1 and2 this
[1:52] week. And I I'm going to try to get a
[1:54] sermon of all the people where the Bible
[1:56] called them men and women of integrity.
[1:59] Hallelujah. Because God God calls Job a
[2:02] man of integrity. Hallelujah.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; And here God calls David a man of
[2:06] integrity. There was times when they
[2:08] were they were they were giving all
[2:10] their diligence to live a life of
[2:12] integrity to obey all the word of God.
[2:14] Verse 72. So he fed them according to
[2:17] the integrity of his heart and guided
[2:18] them by the skillfulness of his hands.
[2:21] Hallelujah.
[2:23] Now I'm just going to briefly review
[2:25] because I got a short time. But before
[2:27] David, the Bible told us in Psalm 78,
[2:29] the Israel rebelled in the wilderness.
[2:32] They set up idols as well. And then the
[2:35] Bible says that uh the ark was captured,
[2:38] right? Uh by the Philistines and Saul
[2:42] failed as king. Now, at the end of the
[2:44] service, we're going to look at how Saul
[2:47] treated the ark or the ephod. Now, you
[2:49] might be familiar with that, but it was
[2:50] a good review. It was a good review for
[2:52] me today as I was studying.
[2:54] And so, that what that's what caused God
[2:56] to go to sleep. So, church, if we let
[2:59] idols in our life, if we rebel and
[3:01] disobey the word of God, God will go to
[3:04] sleep in our lives. Now, we know he
[3:06] never slumbers, but it just means he
[3:07] won't move in our lives. He'll hear less
[3:09] of our prayers because we've disobeyed
[3:12] the word of God. Amen.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we lose the prince of
[3:16] God. That's why David said, "Restore the
[3:18] joy." Right? That's a joy is an
[3:19] anointing of the Holy Ghost. Restore the
[3:21] joy. Take not your Holy Spirit from me.
[3:23] Praise God. So for us, we don't need a
[3:25] physical ark. We know our heart is the
[3:28] throne of God. Hallelujah. Our mind, our
[3:30] human spirit is the throne of God. This
[3:32] is the throne God wants to sit on. He
[3:35] wants to sit on the throne of your
[3:36] spirit and your soul. That's right. So,
[3:39] what did David do? David uh overcame
[3:42] Satan. Hallelujah. David restored the
[3:45] ark. David established unified worship
[3:48] of all the tribes. Hallelujah. He
[3:50] brought a national revival. He expanded
[3:53] the the territory of Israel. Hallelujah.
[3:56] To what uh it was promised by Joshua
[3:59] that Israel had never accomplished. So
[4:01] David was so obedient that God woke up
[4:04] and started defeating all the enemies.
[4:06] How many remember uh how many remember
[4:08] how many uh victories he won? 14. Four.
[4:11] At least 14 victories record in the
[4:13] Bible. Saul only had five. Now, if we
[4:16] thank God for five, five is better than
[4:18] zero.
[4:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; But if 14's possible, church, let's
[4:23] believe that God will do what's possible
[4:24] in our lives. Hallelujah.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Let's not fall short of God's glory.
[4:28] Let's give everything we can so God can
[4:30] be fully glorified in our lives. Amen. I
[4:34] don't want five victories. I want 14.
[4:36] Hallelujah. Or as many as God can give
[4:38] us. Hallelujah. And then we looked at
[4:41] David's nine examples of having
[4:42] integrity versus his seven examples of
[4:45] having iniquity. And then we looked at
[4:47] and we close with how brother Ram said
[4:49] the bride has been awakened. Well,
[4:51] church, if the bride's been awakened,
[4:53] that means Jesus is awakened in your
[4:55] life.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you tonight so you
[4:57] can know how God's awakened in your
[4:59] life. I'm going to show you through many
[5:01] many well I say many many but lots of
[5:03] New Testament verses. Brother Random
[5:06] said that he said uh in back in his day
[5:08] in 1964 people were saying fast and pray
[5:12] something's going to happen. But brother
[5:13] Brandham says why are they doing that?
[5:14] They're good people. He said they
[5:16] haven't recognized the awakening of the
[5:18] bride.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; So the bride was awakened through the
[5:21] ministry of William Brandham.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; That's what all the dictionaries and the
[5:24] encyclopedias say. His his ministry was
[5:28] the spearhead that went into the heart
[5:30] of America and really the world after
[5:32] World War II.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was the spearhead that
[5:36] led the charge for supernatural. Amen.
[5:38] For miracles, for signs, wonders, for
[5:41] discernment, and also for thus sayith
[5:43] the Lord. Hallelujah.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[5:48] And uh so now get your Bibles handy here
[5:50] by God's grace. We we finished the
[5:53] service on Sunday with 1 Thessalonians
[5:55] 5. We read the whole chapter. But go to
[5:57] 1 Thessalonians 4:3.
[6:02] We read in 1 Thessalonians 5 that we
[6:04] will be awake. We are children of the
[6:06] day. We are not children of the night.
[6:09] We are not going to miss the rapture.
[6:11] We're going to have our eyes wide open
[6:12] for the rapture. Praise God.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; We will see Jesus. Hallelujah. How many
[6:16] believe that? By God's grace.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because your child of
[6:21] the day. Look at verse three in 1
[6:23] Thessalonians 4. For this is the will of
[6:25] God, even your sanctification, that you
[6:27] should abstain from fornication. You're
[6:29] going to see this, church. Your sexual
[6:31] purity is one of the biggest indicators
[6:33] that you're awake. Amen. That God is
[6:37] awake in your life. If you can live
[6:39] sexually pure, God will wake up in your
[6:41] life. Hallelujah.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's one of the biggest indicators
[6:46] that God is living in your life and
[6:49] God's not sleeping. Hallelujah.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Now go down to verse five. Not in the
[6:54] lust of concoctions. Now that word means
[6:56] craving. So see again, if we're if we
[6:59] are constantly giving into lustful
[7:00] cravings, we're probably asleeping on
[7:02] God. And so God's sleeping on us.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; But if you keep your body pure sexually
[7:08] and you overcome your lust,
[7:11] the Bible says that God will awaken your
[7:13] life. You'll be children of the day.
[7:16] Look at verse six. Now, here's where we
[7:17] get how we treat each other. This is
[7:18] good for communion. We just had
[7:20] communion a few weeks ago. Verse six,
[7:22] that no man go beyond and defraud his
[7:24] brother in any manner. That means take
[7:26] advantage. That means I'm not going to
[7:28] take advantage of you to get money from
[7:30] you or close or influence or uh put my
[7:33] put my videos on your channel and and
[7:35] and try to promote me with your social
[7:37] media. A real man of God won't take
[7:40] advantage of a of a of a person.
[7:41] Hallelujah.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; And neither will you. Praise God. If if
[7:45] you're not a preacher, you won't take
[7:46] advantage of people. You'll try to help
[7:48] people.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; So, a good way you know God's awake in
[7:52] your life is you're not mistreating
[7:54] people. You're treating them the right
[7:55] way.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; You got sexual purity. You keep your
[7:59] cravings under control. You treat each
[8:02] other the right way. You don't defraud
[8:04] one another. Hallelujah. Now, verse
[8:06] seven, for God has not called us under
[8:07] uncleanness. That means luxurious
[8:09] living. Now, church, we can all we can
[8:12] all get upset at these billionaires,
[8:14] right? Oh, look at their luxurious
[8:15] living. But church, when we buy things
[8:16] we don't need, that's luxury.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Did you hear me?
[8:21] &gt;&gt; If we buy a car we can't afford, that's
[8:23] luxury.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Anything we buy that's too much for us,
[8:28] that's luxury. We're living in
[8:30] uncleanness.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Because the borrower is serving to the
[8:35] lender.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; So, I know Malachi's monthly income now,
[8:39] right? So, if he tried to tell me, "Dad,
[8:40] I want to go and buy this brand new
[8:41] truck." I say, "It's out of your price
[8:44] range." And she's like, "I'm going to do
[8:44] it anyway. I'm 18." He would be guilty
[8:47] of uncleanness.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Not I'm going to get off him now.
[8:51] I'm I think I was guilty of uncleanness
[8:53] at one time because I had five debts at
[8:54] the same time. So, let me just be
[8:56] honest. And I suffered for it, too.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; I suffered for it. Because God rebukes
[9:02] all children that he loves. Hallelujah.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; If the Lord loves you, he'll chasen you.
[9:07] Praise God.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; I had to learn don't get debt after debt
[9:10] after debt after debt.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:14] Chris and I had a good talk about
[9:16] finances, right? This is why it's on my
[9:17] mind. But I I told him I was guilty of
[9:20] that. I was getting luxuries. I didn't.
[9:23] And I and I've had to cancel things.
[9:24] I've had to cancel subscriptions these
[9:26] last few months because things are
[9:28] getting tighter. See, uh any things that
[9:31] are luxuries, church, we got to cast
[9:33] them down. Right now, it's okay to have
[9:35] them if they're all right, but I'm just
[9:36] saying we have to be willing to let
[9:37] things go. We can't get too comfortable
[9:39] in Leodysia.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's uncleanness. So
[9:43] luxurious living.
[9:46] Now verse 11, go down to verse 11. Aaca.
[9:49] And that you study to be quiet. So the
[9:51] opposite of that is a loud life. If
[9:53] you're loud, if your life is constantly
[9:54] in other people's business and do your
[9:57] own business. So see, when people start
[9:58] getting other people's affairs, that
[10:00] shows they're sleeping on Jesus.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That means they'll be
[10:05] children of the darkness and not
[10:07] children of the day.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; And do your work with your own hands.
[10:11] That's why I appreciate everybody
[10:12] getting a good job, right? Work your
[10:14] tail off. People that uh what do they
[10:17] call it? They're parasite after other
[10:18] people. Those people are sleeping on
[10:21] Jesus and Jesus will sleep on them.
[10:23] They'll go in the tribulation period.
[10:25] Hallelujah. That's right.
[10:28] So, you take care of your own business.
[10:30] You live a quiet, humble life. Work as
[10:32] hard as you can. Verse 12. That ye may
[10:34] walk honestly. So, there's the last one.
[10:36] Be honest.
[10:38] Don't lie. Don't tell little lies and
[10:41] white lies because it's still a lie no
[10:42] matter what. Hallelujah.
[10:44] Walk honestly. All right. Now, how about
[10:47] how many appreciate that by God's grace?
[10:50] &gt;&gt; So, people that do those things are
[10:52] sleeping on Jesus. Now, go to Romans 13.
[10:57] Romans 13.
[11:01] Verse 10. Romans 13:10.
[11:04] I made it real serious, real fast,
[11:06] didn't I? All those sins. Brother Scott
[11:09] Walker was here and he said, "You know
[11:10] what, brother Jesse? What? You know what
[11:11] I like about you?" He said, "You preach
[11:12] on sin all the time." Well, it's because
[11:15] I battle it all the time and everybody
[11:16] else does, too.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to keep you clean by the
[11:20] grace of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[11:23] And always at the end, we always offer,
[11:25] come up for forgiveness. Come up for
[11:26] victory. Jesus is here. Greater is he
[11:29] that's in us than he that's in the
[11:30] world. Praise God. All it takes is a
[11:33] simple repentance, a true humility, and
[11:35] the evil spirit will leave, and the
[11:37] power of God will come on us.
[11:39] Hallelujah.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Love workketh no ill to
[11:43] his neighbor. Therefore, love is the
[11:45] fulfilling of the law. So again, you see
[11:46] this, how we treat others proves if God
[11:49] is waken in our lives. Verse 11, and
[11:52] that knowing the time that now is the
[11:54] high time to awake out of sleep. For now
[11:56] is our salvation nearer than when we
[11:58] believed. The night is far spent, the
[12:00] day is at hand. Let us therefore cast
[12:02] off the works of darkness and let us put
[12:04] on the armor of light. Now here, look,
[12:05] you see it's some repeat here, right?
[12:07] It's saying it's time to wake up. So if
[12:11] you're falling asleep tonight, I'm going
[12:12] to try to wake you up. Hallelujah.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; If you're falling asleep physically, I'm
[12:16] going to try to wake you up spiritually
[12:17] and physically. But I want everybody to
[12:19] be awake spiritually tonight. Praise
[12:21] God.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; Let us walk honestly. There it is again.
[12:24] Honesty. Always tell the whole truth.
[12:27] People will appreciate you more if you
[12:29] tell the whole truth
[12:32] &gt;&gt; as in the day, not in rioting. So those
[12:34] are night parties and drunkenness. We
[12:36] know what that is. So see church,
[12:37] anybody getting drunk. Now Austin, we
[12:39] know Rod, we know all these people that
[12:41] go to church, if they get drunk in their
[12:42] houses, then they're sleeping on Jesus,
[12:44] they're not awake. It's proof right
[12:46] there. Hallelujah. It's just so simple.
[12:49] People that mistreat their body, whether
[12:51] sexual sin or drunkenness or mistreating
[12:54] others. All these, this is what the
[12:56] Bible says, not brother Jesse. The Bible
[12:58] says that these people are sleeping
[13:00] spiritually and they need to wake up
[13:02] before it's too late.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Like these men, these grown men in their
[13:05] 40s dying because of heart attacks. We
[13:07] never know when it's our time. God will
[13:09] help us to be ready though. Praise God.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; That's what services like these are for.
[13:14] Amen. To make us ready to meet Jesus.
[13:16] Hallelujah. No matter what time he
[13:18] comes, none of us are guaranteed
[13:20] tomorrow.
[13:22] Not in chambering or wentness. I can
[13:25] never say that word. Which means
[13:26] unbridledness. Now, chambering
[13:28] chambering means sleeping around like in
[13:29] fornication before you're married. And
[13:32] uh wentness means unbridled lust. In
[13:34] other words, you just whatever lust. So,
[13:36] you see how it goes with the cravings
[13:37] verse? Just whatever you your flesh
[13:39] wants, I give it to it. That means a
[13:42] person's sleeping on Jesus. And strife.
[13:45] Now, that's contention, right? arguments
[13:46] in the church, disagreements in the
[13:48] church, and people won't repent of it.
[13:50] That shows they're sleeping on Jesus.
[13:53] And envying, I want what they have and I
[13:55] got to have it, and I I'm angry with
[13:57] them, and I'm jealous of them. That's
[13:59] sin as well.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; People are sleeping on God. Hallelujah.
[14:05] Now, go to uh 1 Corinthians 15:33. Now,
[14:08] I'm going to get to David and Saul
[14:10] eventually here, mostly Saul. 1
[14:13] Corinthians 15:33. Be not deceived. Evil
[14:16] communications, that just means any
[14:17] talking, corrupt good manners or morals.
[14:21] So be very careful what words we speak
[14:24] because that will corrupt our words will
[14:27] corrupt our decisions.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; Right? Because it starts as a thought
[14:31] and then a word and then an action.
[14:33] Right. Now look at verse 34. See how
[14:36] Yeah, brother Chris.
[14:41] Yes. Perfect. Yeah. Give them two claps.
[14:43] Yeah. Exactly. Yes. If if people start
[14:45] singing songs about lust or boyfriend or
[14:48] girlfriend, I don't care if it's a slow
[14:49] song. I I tell people, don't listen to
[14:51] any of that. It's going to let an evil
[14:53] spirit on them. They're going to think
[14:55] about it. They're going to sing it and
[14:56] pretty soon they're going to be doing
[14:57] it, but they've already probably done it
[14:59] in their mind already. And Jesus said
[15:00] they're just as guilty,
[15:01] &gt;&gt; right? They don't repent. That's why we
[15:03] constantly repent of our thoughts, our
[15:05] deeds, our words. Every idol word, we
[15:07] repent of it. So on the day of judgment,
[15:09] there's no condemnation to them that are
[15:11] in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that verse. Hallelujah. I
[15:15] know I use it a lot, but I ought to.
[15:17] Hallelujah. Now, good manners or morals.
[15:19] Now, look at the next verse. 34. Awake
[15:21] to what? Righteousness. So, see, people
[15:24] that speak evil things or have bad moral
[15:27] decisions, they're sleeping on Jesus.
[15:29] And Paul says, "Wake up and obey the
[15:31] word of God
[15:33] &gt;&gt; and sin not for some have not the
[15:36] knowledge of God. I speak this to your
[15:37] shame." All right. Matthew 25:5. If you
[15:41] got your Bibles, Matthew 25:5. Waking up
[15:45] also means to trim your lamp, which
[15:48] basically means sanctification. Because
[15:50] when you trim the lamp, you cut off you
[15:51] cut off the part of the wick that's
[15:53] burned over because it's not going to
[15:55] burn as bright and you got to pull it
[15:56] up, right? So it has room to grow or
[15:59] room to burn down. Okay? So it's it's
[16:02] cleaning off. So sanctification. Verse
[16:04] five. While the bridegroom tried, they
[16:06] all slumbered and slept. And at midnight
[16:08] there was a cry made, behold the
[16:09] bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet
[16:11] him. Then all the virgins arose and trim
[16:14] their lamps. So here people when they
[16:17] hear Jesus coming, there's a rapture and
[16:19] they start cleaning up their life. That
[16:21] shows they're awake. I hope you can say
[16:23] amen that you're awake.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Good. That was a good hearty amen. You
[16:28] ought to say that. Praise God. You ought
[16:30] to say, I've heard brother's message,
[16:32] Jesus coming back. Brother Ram's uh gift
[16:34] was the last sign to the Gentiles. Thus
[16:36] sayith the Lord. Amen.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; It was the last worldwide sign to the
[16:40] Gentiles because it was it was a
[16:42] prophetic gift discerning the thoughts
[16:44] and intents of the heart just like Jesus
[16:46] did to the woman at the well and Philip
[16:48] and Nathaniel. Hallelujah. And even
[16:49] Peter, praise God.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; He discerned the thoughts and intents of
[16:53] their heart.
[16:55] Mark 13,
[16:57] Jesus tells the parable. Mark 13:33.
[16:59] Sorry, I should have told you. Jesus
[17:01] said, "Take heed, watch, and pray for
[17:02] you know not when the time is. So see,
[17:04] if you're not praying, you might get
[17:06] sleepy on God.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; You got to pray, church. You got to pray
[17:10] and watch. Just force yourself. Just
[17:13] start with a five-minute timer. If you
[17:14] can't do one minute or if you can't do
[17:15] 10 minutes, do five minutes. Can't do
[17:17] five, 10, 15, you put it up there and
[17:19] force your body. Bring your body into
[17:21] subjection. Pretty soon you'll start
[17:23] enjoying it. Hallelujah. Because you got
[17:24] to get you got to get out of the spirit
[17:26] of the flesh and you got to get under
[17:28] the Holy Spirit anointing.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:32] Take ye heed, watch and pray, for you
[17:35] know not when the time is. For the Son
[17:36] of Man is as a man taking a far journey
[17:38] who left his house and gave authority to
[17:40] his servants and to every man his work
[17:42] and commanded their porter to watch.
[17:43] Church, what's your work? Everybody has
[17:45] work. What's your work for the kingdom
[17:46] of God? You ought to know. Hallelujah.
[17:51] That's right.
[17:53] He says verse 35, "Watch ye therefore,
[17:55] for you know not when the master of the
[17:57] house cometh at even or at midnight or
[17:59] at the crowing or in the morning,
[18:00] lest he come suddenly and find you."
[18:03] It's a natural story about spiritual
[18:06] slumber. Lest he find you in
[18:08] fornication, lest he find you being
[18:11] dishonest,
[18:12] &gt;&gt; lest he find you with evil
[18:14] communications or mistreating the
[18:16] brethren or being lazy. And the church
[18:17] said,
[18:18] &gt;&gt; "Amen." all those sins. The Bible said,
[18:21] "Awake, wake to righteousness and and
[18:23] wake up from your sleep. Start obeying
[18:25] the word of God." Hallelujah. Amen.
[18:28] Thank you, Jesus. Let's Okay. Verse 37.
[18:31] And I say unto you, I say unto all,
[18:33] watch. Watch means to be cautious. Give
[18:35] strict attention to. So really watch
[18:39] over your life and make sure your life
[18:41] shows that you're awake to
[18:42] righteousness.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Church, if you know better and you're
[18:46] doing sin, then lay at the altar. Find
[18:48] some place to find somebody to confess
[18:49] your sin to. Do whatever you need to do
[18:52] to get victory over sin and wake up
[18:54] spiritually. Praise God.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have to do. Praise God.
[19:00] Now, Ephesians 5 verse three. Ephesians
[19:05] 5:3. We're to go. This is a lot of
[19:07] repeat and it's all is everybody seeing
[19:10] this? All these scriptures are talking
[19:11] about waking up from sleep.
[19:14] God awakened in the days of David
[19:16] because David awakened to obedience.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; And Saul, what was Saul? Saul was
[19:22] sleeping on God because of all his sins.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Right? Verse three, uh, Ephesians 5:3.
[19:28] But fornication and all uncleanness, now
[19:31] there's luxurious living again, buying
[19:33] luxuries you can't afford,
[19:35] or covetousness, that's wanting what
[19:37] other people have. Let it not be once
[19:39] named among you as become as saints.
[19:41] Neither filthiness nor foolish talking
[19:43] nor jesting. So see, watch your jokes.
[19:45] Don't do dirty jokes. There are clean
[19:47] jokes. There's such a thing as clean
[19:48] jokes. We know that.
[19:50] But see, if people are telling dirty
[19:52] jokes or filthiness or foolish talking,
[19:54] they might be sleeping on God.
[19:58] That means not ready for his coming. So
[20:00] instead of that, what should you do?
[20:01] Instead of all those jokes, what you do?
[20:03] Just give God some thanks.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Just spend your day saying, "God is
[20:06] good. Thank you, Jesus. The Lord be
[20:08] magnified. Hallelujah.
[20:11] Now verse five. For this you know that
[20:13] no horarmonger, that's a man who sleeps
[20:15] around. A man who sleeps around no
[20:17] unclean person, that's a luxurious
[20:19] living again, and covetous man who is
[20:21] like an idoltor, I'm sorry, who is an
[20:23] idoltor, hath any inheritance in the
[20:25] kingdom, sorry, of Christ and of God,
[20:28] pardon me, verse six, let no man deceive
[20:30] you with vain words. For because of
[20:32] these things cometh the wrath of God
[20:34] upon the children of disobedience. Did
[20:36] everybody catch that?
[20:37] God's wrath is coming because of all
[20:39] these late night dirty talk show people
[20:42] telling these filthy jokes.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. About Trump or whoever,
[20:47] whatever it is, doesn't matter who it
[20:48] is, the wrath of God is coming on them.
[20:51] We ought to be found though giving God
[20:53] thanks tonight. Hallelujah.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be drawn to those things.
[20:57] We should be drawn to the truth of God's
[20:59] word. Hallelujah.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Giving thanks.
[21:03] Hallelujah.
[21:05] Now go down to verse
[21:10] 12. Let's go down to verse 12. For it's
[21:11] a shame even to speak of those things
[21:13] which are done to them in secret. We got
[21:14] to be careful church. We can't escape
[21:16] the news. But we got to be careful not
[21:18] to share news that's about secret sins
[21:20] of evildoers because it might stir
[21:22] something up in our minds. Hallelujah.
[21:26] Right? We got to be very careful.
[21:30] So that's that Bible gives that wisdom.
[21:32] Right? And and when you check the news,
[21:34] you got to be careful of that. I'm just
[21:35] talking from my perspective. I' I've
[21:37] noticed that, too. Certain uh uh
[21:39] websites, you know, whether it's Fox
[21:41] News or Google News or uh Newsmax,
[21:44] whatever it is, they'll have little ads
[21:45] and you know, and you got to got to get
[21:47] the setting on to turn those off.
[21:49] Hallelujah.
[21:51] Right. And then we can't if we see it,
[21:53] we can't mention it because it will
[21:55] pervert our thinking. Hallelujah. That's
[21:59] right.
[22:01] Now, here's what we should do. Verse 13,
[22:02] but all things that are reproved or
[22:04] convicted are made manifest by the
[22:07] light. For whatsoever doth make manifest
[22:10] is light. So our life should be able to
[22:13] discern what's good and evil and call
[22:15] out the evil.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Now look at verse 14. Wherefore he says,
[22:19] what does he say? Awake.
[22:21] Don't go to sleep. Hallelujah. Wake up.
[22:23] Hallelujah.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Thou that sleepest and rise from the
[22:26] dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
[22:29] Hallelujah. Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; See then that you walk circumspectly,
[22:32] which means diligently or exactly. Know
[22:35] exactly where you're walking. There it
[22:36] is. Circumspectly,
[22:39] not as fools, but as wise church, that's
[22:42] why I like Rod, you know, other other
[22:44] people that like to plan out their day.
[22:46] You know, I like I I found when I plan
[22:48] out my day and I write down what I'm
[22:49] going to do, I have more success
[22:51] overcoming the devil's temptations
[22:53] because you're walking circumspectly.
[22:56] You know exactly what you're going to do
[22:58] today. I had about nine things on my
[23:00] to-do list today. I got like eight of
[23:01] them done. I was like, "Hallelujah.
[23:02] Thank you, Jesus." I had to make sure I
[23:04] read my Bible first, get in the prayer
[23:06] closet, all these things. I always love
[23:07] how God shows up. Hallelujah. When we
[23:10] try to be circumspect, when we try to be
[23:11] diligent, God always shows up.
[23:13] Hallelujah.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But fools kind of wonder, "Well,
[23:18] maybe I'll do this today. Maybe I'll do
[23:19] that today." Let's pray and ask God,
[23:21] "God, show me what I'm supposed to do
[23:23] today."
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Let's not wander into things. Let's do
[23:27] what God called us to do. Hallelujah.
[23:30] Now, the the last one there in this
[23:32] section is verse 18. And be not drunk
[23:34] with wine, but be filled with the
[23:36] spirit. Hallelujah. So again, see how
[23:39] wine puts people to sleep spiritually.
[23:42] Everybody see that?
[23:45] Now, believe it or not, I'm coming down
[23:47] to my close.
[23:50] How many minutes on there? 23.
[23:53] Hallelujah.
[23:54] I'm quite surprised. But this is going
[23:56] to take all the remaining minutes here.
[23:59] Now, I'm closing with this thought. I
[24:01] mentioned this on Sunday. Let's look at
[24:03] Saul and David. Now, tonight we're just
[24:05] look at Saul. How did Saul treat the ark
[24:08] of God?
[24:11] Some of you might have a good guess, but
[24:12] I'm going to show you the exact
[24:13] scriptures.
[24:15] Now, church, what does this mean for us?
[24:17] And brother Rod, I got a real nice Bible
[24:19] here. Look at Rod's name on there.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Rod gave me his first Scoffield Bible.
[24:24] I forgot my other Bible. home, brother.
[24:26] So, I'll tell you, it came in super
[24:27] handy.
[24:30] But church, what why are we talking
[24:31] about Saul and the ark? Because
[24:34] it's like you and I trying to find the
[24:36] will of God. Saul, his treatment of the
[24:39] ark is your treatment of this Bible and
[24:42] prayer.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Does everybody understand?
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Now, Saul couldn't go. Let's let's say
[24:48] this this is the ark of the covenant. It
[24:49] kind of looks like one actually, at
[24:51] least the way it's set up, like the the
[24:53] rectangular prism.
[24:55] Saul could not go before the ark. So
[24:57] Saul would have to have the high priest
[24:59] go to the ark and the high priest would
[25:02] go in with the blood worship and he
[25:04] would speak to God. Right now we know it
[25:06] didn't happen but it almost happened
[25:08] which might surprise you. But this would
[25:11] happen with Aaron. Of course. Aaron
[25:12] would go in talk to God. Come out and
[25:14] I've got thus sayith the Lord.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[25:18] That's what the ark was. God said
[25:20] remember remember I preached on last
[25:21] week. God will I said, "I'll meet you
[25:22] there."
[25:24] Where's God going to meet you, church?
[25:26] God's going to meet you right now. Yes.
[25:28] Can he meet you in the car? Sure. But
[25:30] you know where he wants to meet you? He
[25:31] said, "I want to I want I want to hear
[25:33] your voice in the morning." David said,
[25:34] "Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my
[25:36] voice."
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Early. Jesus, the Bible said, "Early
[25:41] will I seek thee." And then remember
[25:43] Proverbs says, "If you seek me, you
[25:45] shall find me."
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is your and my arc
[25:51] of the covenant. We'd say we read the
[25:54] word and then God tells us what to do.
[25:56] Brother Chris, I've done that for all my
[25:59] Christian life. I've been a Christian
[26:00] since 2000. So 25 years of my life,
[26:02] brother Rod, how many years you been
[26:03] serving God, brother?
[26:07] Hallelujah. 40 years. Let's say praise
[26:09] the Lord. Can we
[26:11] &gt;&gt; think about that? For 40 years, Brother
[26:12] Rod has come before the ark and said,
[26:14] "Lord, I'm going to read today. I'm
[26:17] gonna Hallelujah. I'm going to devote
[26:19] myself to finding the will of God.
[26:22] Hallelujah. Look at a testimony that
[26:24] Brother Rod has. Now, I know it more
[26:26] than you guys. Hallelujah. Because I
[26:28] spent more time with him, but trust me.
[26:29] Hallelujah. It's beautiful testimony.
[26:33] But that that's where the Christian gets
[26:34] the victory. You go here to the word of
[26:37] God in prayer and God will put something
[26:39] on your heart. Now, maybe it won't
[26:40] happen right there, but as you go about
[26:42] your day, you keep meditating on God and
[26:44] God will bring that thought right to
[26:45] your mind.
[26:47] How many times have I had that? I'll get
[26:48] a sermon thought in the shower, Brother
[26:50] Austin. Or maybe uh on the last minute
[26:53] on the drive to church. Hallelujah. Many
[26:57] times I've said, "Honey, I'm driving.
[26:58] Honey, take my phone. Text me these
[27:00] scriptures." And it'll be just what I
[27:02] needed to to to have to put in the
[27:03] sermon. By God's grace, it just I'm just
[27:05] driving and it comes right. God can
[27:08] speak to us at any time. Praise God. Or
[27:10] how many times I've not I've not know
[27:12] what to pray for somebody, but then God
[27:14] prays through me. Praise God.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; And God hears their prayer. God hears
[27:18] our prayer. See, this is your ark of the
[27:22] covenant. Now, church, believe it or
[27:24] not, there's only four times that the
[27:28] ark or the ephod is mentioned in Saul's
[27:32] ministry, in Saul's life. So, get your
[27:34] Bibles ready.
[27:36] Let's start with 1st Samuel 14:18.
[27:40] 1st Samuel 14:18 and 19.
[27:44] But church, this ought to be a great eye
[27:46] openener between the difference between
[27:47] a foolish virgin and a wise virgin.
[27:51] David is the prefigure of the wise
[27:54] virgin. King Saul is the prefigure of
[27:56] the foolish virgin. Barely saved. He
[27:59] didn't deserve to be saved. Well,
[28:00] really, none of us do.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; None of us deserve to be saved.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; I like that. Where's Where's my card?
[28:10] &gt;&gt; None of us deserve to be saved. Amen.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; That That's the word,
[28:15] &gt;&gt; right? And I I know I'm not I'm just
[28:17] joking with everybody. It's just nice to
[28:19] hear an amen. Hallelujah.
[28:22] But but he look at his attitude toward
[28:25] the word. Now, this is the battle of the
[28:26] Philistines, which they won. Now, look
[28:28] what Saul does. And Saul said unto Ahi,
[28:31] "Bring hither the ark of God. For the
[28:33] ark of God was that time with the
[28:34] children of Israel." Now, watch this.
[28:35] And it came to pass while Saul talked to
[28:37] the priest, he's saying, "Go into God.
[28:39] Get the word of the Lord. How how are we
[28:41] going to win this battle? The
[28:42] Philistines, how are we going to defeat
[28:43] him? Watch this.
[28:45] As he's talking, the noise that was in
[28:47] the host of the Philistines went on and
[28:49] increased. And what does Saul say? The
[28:52] battle gets so loud. What does he say?
[28:54] He says, "Oh no, withdraw thine hand."
[28:59] Church, the noise of the battle made him
[29:03] stop seeking the will of God
[29:06] and the noise of your life sometimes.
[29:08] And the church said,
[29:11] cause you say, "Oh, no. I don't have
[29:12] time to read my Bible."
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say it, too. Sometimes I
[29:16] don't do it either. I don't have time to
[29:18] pray because of the noise going on in my
[29:20] life.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Church, listen. This is the closest he
[29:25] ever got to getting thus sayith the Lord
[29:27] from the ark. After this, he never even
[29:30] sniffed it. We'd say he never even got
[29:32] close to the ark of God. This was the
[29:35] closest he got. This is chapter 14. In
[29:38] chapter 15, God rejects him from being
[29:41] king.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; The closest he got is like, "Okay, God.
[29:46] I'm going to read and pray today and I'm
[29:48] Oh, there's an alarm. Oh, I'm sorry,
[29:49] God. I'll leave that to I got to go to
[29:51] work. I got to go whatever.
[29:54] I got to go get uh Chipotle or for maybe
[29:57] I got to go get my pizza." This is the
[30:00] closest he's got. He's about ready to
[30:02] go. Oh, and life gets so loud. He says,
[30:06] "That's okay. Don't go in. And notice
[30:08] church, God gave them the victory. If
[30:10] you read the last last verse of the
[30:12] chapter, God gave him the victory. It's
[30:14] verse 33. So the Lord saved Israel that
[30:17] day. It was because of Jonathan.
[30:20] Jonathan is armor bearer actually
[30:21] attacked this army. Put him in all this
[30:23] confusion and it led to the victory.
[30:26] So look, Saul asked for the ark, the
[30:29] ephod, the yurum thumbum when the
[30:31] Pharisees attacked, but interrupted the
[30:33] consultation before receiving an answer
[30:36] from God. This shows uh Saul was
[30:39] impatient and he disregarded thus sayeth
[30:43] the Lord. Now you know why that's
[30:45] important to us because I preached many
[30:46] thus sayith the Lords from William
[30:47] Brandon and church I haven't just told
[30:50] you most of them church I put up here.
[30:53] How many are witnesses to that?
[30:55] &gt;&gt; When Rod's been here, I preached two
[30:56] sermons on thus sayith the Lord's,
[30:57] right? But over the years, church, how
[31:00] many times have I heard thus sayith the
[31:01] Lord? Or how many how many times have I
[31:02] preached it? And Saul would stop short.
[31:05] He says, well, I don't have time for
[31:07] that, church. If we have a thus sayith
[31:09] the Lord, let's obey it.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; I went through many of them, right? Been
[31:13] through over 30. I got I have 31 in my
[31:16] final chapter of that book. Everybody
[31:18] should have a free copy by God's grace.
[31:22] So, can everybody see the parallel here?
[31:24] You better really spend some time with
[31:25] my life is too loud. My life is too
[31:28] busy. I'm not going to No, that's okay.
[31:30] Just withdraw. Don't spend that time
[31:32] with God. Now, look, does God bless him?
[31:35] Yes. God blesses him and he still gets a
[31:38] victory.
[31:39] God might bless you and I, but God wants
[31:42] us to have the ark. God wants us to
[31:44] spend time with the ark.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, don't withdraw from
[31:48] God's presence. Run to God's presence.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; If you didn't do this morning, you
[31:54] tonight when you go home, spend some
[31:56] time with God.
[31:58] You've got to get in the habit. You've
[31:59] got to addict yourself to the presence
[32:01] of God. Hallelujah.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the Bible says. They
[32:05] addicted themselves to the ministry of
[32:08] the saints in the end of uh either
[32:09] Corinthians or Romans. House of
[32:12] Stefanis.
[32:16] Now, here's the next time it's
[32:17] mentioned. 1 Chronicles 13:3.
[32:21] I hope that's the right verse.
[32:25] This is this is David's word after he be
[32:27] this is his words after he becomes king.
[32:30] Let us bring again the ark of God for us
[32:32] for we inquire not at it in the days of
[32:34] Saul. Think about that. Saul got so
[32:38] close but he actually didn't inquire
[32:40] from it. What am I saying? We can get so
[32:42] close. Sometimes we want to know God's
[32:45] will, but we don't spend enough time to
[32:47] know God's perfect will.
[32:50] Hallelujah.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; God's perfect will for all our major
[32:55] decisions. And I'll say this, all of our
[32:56] minor ones, too.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David's like, think, think
[33:01] about that. We had thus sayith the Lord
[33:02] and in Saul's generation and we never
[33:05] even went to it. Church, are you going
[33:07] to the tapes to hear brother say, thus
[33:08] sayith the Lord? Are you listening to
[33:10] brother Random? You should be. He gave
[33:12] us thus sayith the Lord.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; If you're not then church, what are you
[33:15] doing? You're not inquiring at the at
[33:18] the hand of the Lord, the word of the
[33:19] Lord.
[33:21] Hallelujah.
[33:23] If you need a sermon to listen to, ask
[33:25] me. I'll tell you. I'll let I'll tell
[33:26] you to listen to one I'm listening. I'm
[33:27] listen to spoken word original seed
[33:28] right now. It's a six and a half hour
[33:30] sermon. I I listen to all of it, but I'm
[33:33] just going back to that last hour of it
[33:35] where the Holy Spirit said, "Pick up
[33:36] your pen and write."
[33:38] And there's there's words from the Lord
[33:40] in there. But look, the closest he got
[33:42] was like, "Okay, I'm going to get so
[33:44] close. Oh, no. I'm I got I got too much
[33:46] going on. I can't get in the presence of
[33:48] God right now. I've got too many battles
[33:50] to fight." Church, if you spend time
[33:52] with God, you'll have less battles.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; How many How many witnesses of that?
[33:57] &gt;&gt; If you spend time with God, you'll have
[33:59] less battles to fight.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; But see, it's the noise of busyness that
[34:04] tries to draw us away. Ah, withdraw your
[34:06] hand. Oh, don't spend that time with
[34:08] God.
[34:09] It's the noise of busyiness.
[34:12] The third one,
[34:15] 1st Samuel 28:6.
[34:22] 1st Samuel 28:6. It's okay. And when
[34:25] Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord
[34:27] answered him not, neither by dreams, nor
[34:29] by urum, by prophets. This is at the end
[34:31] of his life. So he's he's wasted all
[34:34] these years chasing David, right? Civil
[34:36] wars in the church.
[34:39] falsely accusing David, wanting to kill
[34:41] David's ministry, stop his ministry,
[34:42] falsely accusing for years, wasted. And
[34:45] now, and now at the end, he's like, "Now
[34:47] I'll try to I'll try to get something
[34:48] from God. Now I have time for God."
[34:51] &gt;&gt; God's like, "No,
[34:54] I was here the whole time.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Now you just want to use me for your own
[34:57] benefit."
[34:59] God shuts the door on. God lets the
[35:01] black cloth drop from heaven. You got no
[35:03] word. And so now he gets what he what he
[35:05] planned at the beginning. Now he he
[35:07] reaps what he sowed. He sowed rebellion
[35:10] which was witchcraft. And now he guts
[35:12] witchcraft
[35:14] &gt;&gt; because of his little disobedience. Now
[35:16] he gets the fullness of it. He has to go
[35:18] to witches.
[35:20] Hallelujah.
[35:22] See that? That's what he planted. So he
[35:24] he reaps what he sws. He planted
[35:27] disobedience so he reaps witchcraft.
[35:31] Hallelujah.
[35:33] My
[35:35] see at the end of his reign he was
[35:36] desperate to spend time with God and get
[35:38] guidance with thus sayith the Lord from
[35:40] the ark but it was too late
[35:43] God wouldn't speak to him through the
[35:44] ark nor the yurum thumbum which was on
[35:46] the ephod
[35:49] withdrew his presence
[35:54] now last one here. Oh yeah this is good.
[35:56] Psalm 22 I'm sorry 1st Samuel 22 18- 19.
[36:00] I'm almost done.
[36:03] How many enjoying the word tonight?
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:06] So, I haven't talked much about David as
[36:09] far as specifically. I'll get to more of
[36:11] that, Lord willing, Sunday. But I've
[36:12] wanted you to see what it means to be
[36:14] awake as a Christian.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to see how one
[36:19] man didn't really seek God. Although,
[36:21] church, if you go read him, he was
[36:23] anointed and prophesied with thus sayith
[36:26] the Lord, Saul. But he still wouldn't
[36:28] spend time with God. and get thus sayith
[36:31] the Lord. See, I don't care how many
[36:33] testimonies people have. What matters is
[36:35] your heart is knit to God's and you want
[36:37] God's perfect will.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; No, don't get me wrong. I love
[36:40] testimonies. I love supernatural. I love
[36:42] all that. But if you don't have the time
[36:44] with God, it doesn't really help you out
[36:46] too much.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; You might get five victories, but with
[36:48] Jesus, you would have got 14. Amen.
[36:50] Hallelujah. With spending time with
[36:52] Jesus, you would have got a lot more
[36:53] victories.
[36:56] Glory. 1st Samuel 22:18-19.
[37:00] What a sermon to come on, brother Rod.
[37:01] What a sermon you chose to come on,
[37:03] brother.
[37:04] Hallelujah. I love this. Amen. Don't you
[37:06] love the word? Amen. This This blew my
[37:08] mind away this morning. Like, wow. He
[37:10] never really ever got thus sayeth the
[37:13] Lord from the ark of God. Now, church,
[37:15] have we really really really made sure
[37:18] we had thus sayith the Lord that we
[37:19] obeyed all the word of God?
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Let's make sure we do it.
[37:26] really make sure you know thus sayith
[37:27] the Lord for your life.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Don't just guess. That's what Saul Saul
[37:31] just guessed and tried to fight the best
[37:32] he could. Yeah, he got a couple
[37:34] victories, but what a miserable life
[37:36] that he lived. All the torment that he
[37:39] he himself chose to be under that
[37:40] torment of hatred and jealousy, right?
[37:43] Anger, murder. Now look what he does.
[37:47] Look what Saul does to the only people
[37:49] who can get thus sayith the Lord for
[37:51] him. What does he do to them? He kills
[37:53] them. So he himself won't go to the ark.
[37:57] And then he kills all those that could
[37:59] go to the ark.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:03] And the king said to Dog, "Turn thou and
[38:05] fall upon the priest." What priests?
[38:07] They're the ones that can go to the ark
[38:09] and dug the Edomite turned and he fell
[38:11] upon the priests and slew on that day
[38:13] four score and five persons that did
[38:15] wear a linen ephod. The ephod is where
[38:18] the the yer thumb went with the 12
[38:20] stones of Israel. and brother Chris,
[38:22] they would go before the Lord and they
[38:24] would talk to God and if those lights
[38:27] shine then the priest knew like it'd be
[38:28] like a yes or no answer. Should we go up
[38:30] to battle? Yes or no? And the yes would
[38:32] be the lights, right? Or something along
[38:34] those lines. They knew how God does it.
[38:35] You know, we have to look in the Bible
[38:37] for more. But the lights would shine and
[38:39] then they the priest would come back in
[38:40] and say, "Praise the Lord. We know we've
[38:42] got thus sayith the Lord." God spoke
[38:43] through the Yurman Thumbum. Amen. The
[38:46] light struck the rock. Amen. The light
[38:49] struck the stones. Hallelujah. and it
[38:51] glistened. Hallelujah. They were
[38:53] children of the light, not children of
[38:54] the darkness. Hallelujah. Amen. The
[38:57] light shined on the 12 stones because
[38:59] we're children of the light. Hallelujah.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Now, what is this for us? It's people
[39:04] that will turn down preachers who are
[39:06] preaching thus sayith the Lord. They'll
[39:07] turn down brother Brandham who gave thus
[39:09] sayith the Lord.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; They'll turn down any quote that says
[39:13] thus sayith the Lord. I'll say it like
[39:14] this. It could be as simple as just
[39:15] turning down anything that we preach on
[39:17] tonight. the honesty, the hard work, the
[39:20] sexual purity,
[39:23] &gt;&gt; treating your brother or sister with
[39:25] godliness, not taking advantage of them.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; It's it's silencing any voice that's
[39:32] telling you, "Thus sayaith the Lord."
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Because that's what the ark was. The ark
[39:37] was thus sayeth the Lord.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now, church, as far as
[39:42] I've studied, those are all the times
[39:45] that Saul is mentioned as going to his
[39:47] Bible. I mean, the Ark of the Covenant.
[39:49] You know what I'm talking about.
[39:52] I mean, that's it. He just went to this
[39:53] Bible like three or four times. Really,
[39:55] it's only three times because one of
[39:57] them is David just saying he never went
[39:58] there. In all his time in the message,
[40:01] he only consulted God just about three
[40:04] times. That's the only time you ever
[40:06] really had a prayer meeting with Jesus.
[40:10] Come on, somebody.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Church. If we just go to church, that's
[40:14] not enough. You got to spend time with
[40:15] God.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; If you're spend time with God, you'll
[40:17] enjoy church more.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Like I do, like
[40:21] everybody does.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; We enjoy church more when we're spending
[40:25] time with Jesus because you've already
[40:26] probably read some of those same verses.
[40:27] Hallelujah.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or listen to some of the same
[40:31] thoughts, some of the same quotes by the
[40:33] grace of God.
[40:36] So see, we must not cut off thus sayith
[40:39] the Lord. Whether it's through brother
[40:40] Brandham, whether it's through the
[40:42] Bible, through the pastor, through your
[40:44] own prayer time, your own Bible reading,
[40:46] you must not cut off thus sayith the
[40:47] Lord. That's what a foolish virgin did.
[40:50] Now, did God have mercy on him? Yes.
[40:52] Samuel said, "You'll be with me
[40:53] tomorrow." Basically in Abraham's bosom.
[40:56] And then remember, he wept all night. He
[40:57] laid on the ground all night repenting.
[40:59] He was united with Jonathan on the last
[41:01] day of his life. But what a disgrace.
[41:03] What a waste of life. church, let's not
[41:05] be uh let's not be wasters of life.
[41:07] Let's redeem the time because the days
[41:08] are evil. Hallelujah. How many want to
[41:10] redeem the time?
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Praise God.
[41:13] Musicians can come.
[41:15] How long was that sermon?
[41:17] Hallelujah.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; I would if it wasn't for my son. And I
[41:23] love my son just like we did for Austin.
[41:26] I appreciate that, brother Chris. Let's
[41:27] give God a round of applause. Amen.
[41:30] And that's right where I thought I'd
[41:31] get. You know, as I studied this morning
[41:33] and and a couple hours of study and
[41:34] prayer, I thought I'd get right to about
[41:36] there. So, we got there by the grace of
[41:38] God. Church, everybody get your Bible.
[41:40] We're going to close it. Put your Bible
[41:42] on your heart here.
[41:46] You got a Bible. Got yours, brother?
[41:51] Yes, sir. Yes. Hey, don't feel bad,
[41:52] brother. Don't feel bad.
[41:56] Church, this is your ark of the
[41:58] covenant.
[42:00] I want you to hold it on your heart, you
[42:01] know, because that this is this is the
[42:03] ark of your heart, right? Your soul is
[42:05] the ark of God, just like your mind's
[42:07] another throne of God.
[42:10] And remember, brother Ram says, Brother
[42:11] Ram says, I love this, Rod. God can do
[42:13] out, God can do things outside the
[42:15] Bible. God could,
[42:18] but Brother Ram said, I just like to
[42:21] believe what's in the Bible. Praise God.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Because then I know for sure that I'm
[42:25] right. Oh, I love that. Amen. Yes, God
[42:28] could possibly do something outside the
[42:30] Bible. Like there could be all these uh
[42:32] other worlds, you know, we'll go to in
[42:33] the future home in the God could do
[42:35] that, but I'm just going to stay with
[42:37] what's right in here because then I know
[42:39] I'm safe with God. Hallelujah.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Then I know I've got at least I got thus
[42:43] sayith the Lord. My for my own
[42:46] understanding, my own life, I've got
[42:48] thus sayith the Lord.
[42:51] Hallelujah. I love this story. This came
[42:53] alive to me today. I don't want to be
[42:55] Saul. I want to be David. Sister
[42:57] Beatress, tomorrow I want to go in my
[42:59] home. I want to open up this Bible. Now
[43:01] be my daughter Bible
[43:04] looks just like this one.
[43:06] I say, Lord, what do you have for me in
[43:07] the book of Job? Because that's what I'm
[43:09] reading right now. What do you have for
[43:12] me?
[43:13] What is thus sayith the Lord Patrick for
[43:15] my life? Hallelujah. Father, let's put
[43:17] your Bibles there. Let's close with a
[43:19] word of prayer.
[43:23] Father God, we have our Bibles on our
[43:25] hearts because we know the word must be
[43:28] in us.
[43:31] We want the perfect will of God in us.
[43:34] Saul, we'd say, Lord, Saul held his
[43:37] Bible away or he walked away from his
[43:39] Bible. But Lord, we want to be like
[43:40] David as we'll show, Lord willing, on
[43:42] Sunday. We want that ark in our heart,
[43:45] dear God. We want the prince of God in
[43:48] our heart, dear Lord Jesus. We want thus
[43:52] sayith the Lord on the throne of our
[43:53] heart. Grant it Lord Jesus.
[43:57] Lord, this is just a symbol of what we
[43:59] need to do every night, every morning
[44:01] and the day with Bible prayer,
[44:04] worship, singing a song,
[44:08] even as David said, meditating on our
[44:11] beds, thinking about the plan of God,
[44:13] quoting the scripture.
[44:15] Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[44:17] I pray Lord we'll be like David as we'll
[44:19] see and as they'll probably remember I
[44:21] preach it about eight or nine years ago.
[44:24] Every time David inquired he got the
[44:27] victory.
[44:28] And yet now as we see tonight Lord Saul
[44:30] never even got to really seeking God. Oh
[44:33] God help us to seek you Lord God. Help
[44:37] us to get down to business with you Lord
[44:38] God. all of us, including the young
[44:41] people, Lord, that their lives could be
[44:44] blessed and spared from scars,
[44:48] cravings of lust, and all kinds of
[44:50] wickedness as we read tonight. And for
[44:52] us that are older, the same truth, Lord,
[44:54] but we've been serving a little longer.
[44:56] We got more experience. Keep us pure,
[44:58] Lord God. Oh God, help us to overcome
[45:00] the Solomon syndrome of getting older
[45:02] and getting laxidasical and lazy on you,
[45:05] oh God, help us to overcome that, Lord
[45:07] Jesus. Our brother Rod and Beatatric
[45:10] stand here as testimonies that if you do
[45:13] it decade after decade, God's blessing
[45:16] and power remains on your life. Thank
[45:18] you, Jesus, for examples of that, Lord
[45:20] God. Hallelujah. Lord, I'm almost at
[45:23] three decades, Lord. I want that, Lord,
[45:24] more than anything else, Lord. To be a
[45:26] man of integrity, to be one who seeks
[45:29] after the word of God. I want to know
[45:30] the Bible. I want to know thus, sayith
[45:32] the Lord. I want to know the perfect
[45:34] will of God.
[45:36] So Lord, we hold our Bibles by our
[45:38] hearts which represent we want the word
[45:41] on the throne of our hearts. Grant it
[45:43] Lord Jesus. Bless your people Lord God.
[45:47] And may they have a heart to know you
[45:49] Lord God. May they start their day with
[45:51] you. May they go before the ark every
[45:55] day Lord God. They didn't even do it in
[45:58] the days of Saul. But Lord David did it.
[46:00] He said one thing I have desired that I
[46:02] might dwell in the house of the Lord all
[46:04] the days of my life. Lord God.
[46:05] Hallelujah. Lord, how we love coming to
[46:07] church. Oh, if I could, as my even my
[46:10] cousin Adam told me, I wish I could
[46:11] spend every day in church, Lord God. How
[46:14] true that is, Lord. That's the prayer of
[46:16] David.
[46:18] But we know in the New Testament, we
[46:19] become the temple of God. We become the
[46:21] church, Lord God. Help us to create an
[46:24] atmosphere, Lord, through living
[46:26] circumspectly, Lord God, making our
[46:28] plans for the day to honor you, to love
[46:30] you, to serve you. Help us, Lord Jesus.
[46:33] I pray may we seek constantly for thus
[46:36] sayaith the scripture thus
