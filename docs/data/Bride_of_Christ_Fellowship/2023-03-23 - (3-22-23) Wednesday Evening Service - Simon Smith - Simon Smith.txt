========================================

brothers and sisters who you'll be with of all the people in the world these are the ones you'll spend eternity with you go to the job site you go to the grocery store you go to a Home Depot or Lowe's and there's no Fellowship there there's no one that wants to hear about the word of God no one cares you offer Bible studies you say hey you want to hear about this or that and nothing turn their head well I'm good you know I'm okay brother Simon or I'm some you know whatever but we are we are of one mind we have one goal we can focus on one thing is that is the Lord Jesus Christ amen right now I just got done a couple months ago with one of the worst jobs I've had in years and then now I'm on a really really nice job where I do stuff that I usually do and guess what I'd still rather be in the house of God than have one good day at work why because this is where we hear Eternal promises the Lord's not gonna on Judgment Day he's not going to run through all my jobs and say well you're sure to mess this up and this and that no I don't think you can necessarily curious I mean we do our best for Jesus in all things but he cares about his word and working for him so I'm not going to sing us I didn't bring oh wait no I better not let's I'm not gonna sing a song right maybe next time let's just get into the word of God here we are it's a Wednesday night brother Jesse says something they're powerful we're I uh and I was kind of feeling led to teach on that a little bit tonight just real simple but uh and I just clicked right with my what I was thinking so uh I trust for in the will of the Lord so let's turn to Second Thessalonians 2. verse one just a real simple thought Saints but we are we're about application tonight I say like that we're about where we're at and what we are about to see you know and what we're going through and what is coming and uh just got some good study in the last couple of nights here that's not necessarily about this topic but just on a certain subject everyone to look at and running through quotes and looking at scripture and just feeling encouraged by God's grace thank you brother um so let's read this here by God's grace if we could all stand here second Thessalonians 2 and 1 then we'll have one more set of scriptures there now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him here we are at the coming of the Lord and we have gathered together sounds rather fitting Maybe notice how we're starting verse two that you shouldn't be not soon shaken in mind why well we all have the ability to hear and we see what the the news and media and what people are talking about Pakistan just had an earthquake 7.7 today 50 000 50 000 just died a couple of what a month ago in Syria or however earthquakes the birth pains are increasing and it is about time for Christ to come on the scene that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as at the day of Christ is at hand and look at verse 3 here let no man deceive you by any means so notice look at where we're at here we're at the Gathering time we're at the time when this thing is going to take place we're literally at the coming of the Lord and he says don't let these things bother you why because if you let these things bother you a deception if you're all worked up about something and we know this is coming it'll be it'll make it a little rougher let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition now if we could uh turn to Revelations 3 15 here by God's grace Turner myself very obviously just very familiar are our day here obviously let's read this here 15 through 17 is that what have you okay 15 through 17 he says I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would the downward cold or hot but then because Thou Art lukewarm neither and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked that's powerheads dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you and oh God we ask God that you would come Lord and speak to your people Lord and Lord you know you made me Lord and uh in the form you've displayed here Lord as we could even open our eyes now Lord and look at one another and not see the real you Lord or see the real them Lord or each other because the real us is in within us Lord and we're just looking out of a shell or the body that you allowed us to uh carry on life and or you know God we yield these bodies Lord to you Lord I will yield our minds Lord tonight and Lord may you bless the people God lord and we want to be so careful God keep my tongue Lord keep my words Lord as I speak Lord before your holy bride Lord because the Bible says blessed are they that are that are blessed and holy Lord for they'll see that first resurrection Lord so bless those blessed and the holy people Lord that I stand before and Lord may your minister to them tonight Lord and Lord give let me just take me off my notes God or give me your thoughts Lord Lord though I may not have the best vocabulary Lord God we just want to say we'd have me to say well we certainly Love You Lord bless the people God and amen you may have seeds here by God's grace they Pursuit we've been greetings from Living Waters Tabernacle there with Kim's uh I'll say this at Jesus Christ Church there pastored by his faithful Shepherd from The can Smith uh the Bride of Jesus Christ Fellowship here Pastor Bible Justice but it's all the Bride of Jesus Christ you know when it comes down to it there's there's nothing that you and I can do outside of what God allows us to do he said well he says you can do nothing without me and saying to God that's why we fail so many times in life is we need to be yielded to and find the mind of the spirit the yield the moving of the spirits of the what God can speak and work through US amen so we I want to look at the scripture again here he says now we beseech your brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ we are very very close he says and by our gathering together unto him we don't come here to obviously I I don't drive you know two and a half hours on a Wednesday night just to uh be on YouTube or or to or to just go up here and stand behind here but we want to there's a motive and objective behind everything we want to if a brother here feels LED and needs a little break we want to be and give him a little break by God's grace and that we of course we want to try and find what the Lord would have to say to to this group here tonight for this season for this little service here by God's grace so uh and I I want to uh in verse 2 where it says be ye not soon shaken in mind or be troubled the unknown is a scary place the unknown is literally being trying to see beyond these four walls what exactly is going on beyond that wall and this wall and this wall and this one though they'd be windows they're blocked off right now we don't know what's on the other side there and that's the unknown is a scary place for many people we uh hear many times of uh people losing all or losing this or losing that and having marital problems or this problem this problems and many people take their own lives and I'll I'll give you a example I went up to Monroe Michigan last Saturday to help out a guy met at work he needed a little wire line run to his out of his basement there or his crawl space and as I was grow driving up there to Monroe I went through one of their main main roads there and as I was driving through I noticed it was literally six no it was probably uh it was about 11 30 or 11 o'clock in the morning and that's pretty early for me on Saturday Amanda give me rest but uh as I was driving I noticed these places and they were completely packed full and I'm looking at you know it's obviously not a McDonald's it's not uh have you ever been through by a Chick-fil-A on a Monday and a Tuesday and a Thursday and obviously not on Sundays but that Chick-fil-A is packed you're waiting 20 minutes on fast food you're waiting 30 minutes sometimes for fast food because so many people want to eat Chick-fil-A right while I'm driving past and I see this place and I'm looking at the names I'm like what is this and I look and I started having the realization that these are uh pot uh distribution or dispensation stores because it's legalized now in Michigan and I'm driving past and there's like six or seven maybe eight of these stores literally covering the sides of the road and they are completely full so I went on to a certain place here did a certain thing I was there about half an hour 45 minutes then I went to this little side job to help this guy out and I was driving back to to two and a half maybe three hours later and I was driving through that and those places are still completely packed Saints have gone uh an Awakening just came as I was driving just something just the burden struck so hard on just saints of God what is going on here they're giving people these drugs to drug them down so they were not be concerned about anything there is a trap being set for the world and as they set the the spring on this trap and the spring on this trap and they're covering their bases here and they're covering Basin there the only way you're not going to notice is if you have your mind you have something else you're entertained with there's other things you care more about than what God has given you which is your freedoms your your mental power your uh your strength your your wisdom your king mental prowess says maybe some would say or however but as they dumb down the people there's only one reason they would do that and that's the cause of distraction and it was working tremendously in Michigan and I feel horrible about this as we said 20 years ago what about 20 years from now as we said 10 years ago what about 10 years from now what if the Lord gives us another 10. what condition will America be this great religious Nation where will it be intent where will the I'll say like this we we're such where would it be in one or two more years but the Bible says be not ye soon shaken in your mind so he's a God as I heard the prophet say he said he says we preach salvation we preach receiving the Holy Ghost he goes every service we call for the Lost we call for The Sinner we do this he says we do that we we call the prayer line we get go to the altar he says but we know he says and he's being frank he's being honest he's being transparent before the people he says he says and all you know he says not everyone he says I know this and we all know this as people preach and Minister whatever what we know the majority will never accept it and the jury will never come a lot of people even the prophet God said in the church in his book he said well he says he says he said there's a reason people will not most people will not receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says but nonetheless we still have to preach it and we have to teach it amen he says that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled when I was driving through that road and just my heart was and I said it's over it's over and it really was a real I live in a small town I don't see much activity I mean there's not you know gang Runners and cabals and all that stuff running through Grand Rapids Ohio but as I go up North I'm just the realization of how I didn't go through downtown Detroit I'm not riding on Nebraska Avenue in Toledo Ohio I'm driving through this town here up in Monroe Michigan and I'm just looking I said this thing's it's over it's over it's almost like it finally struck and I said this thing is over the people the masses are running for comfort the running for satisfaction they're running for a a enjoyment and pleasures of life but you soon not be shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word he says nor by letter as from us as the day of Christ is at hand so notice even even Paul is saying he says no I write he says well right at the end he says and and this is coming and this is coming he says he says even though I warn you of it and write it he says don't let it trouble you amen why because when you are in the hand of God nothing can what the Bible says what God hath this seal he knoweth those that are his amen and the prophet of God said he said as he's starting to bald as I'm experiencing now he says his wife said well where's your hair he goes in the same place it was beforehand amen Amen brother yes there were probably doesn't battle that too much for the me brother Ray I'm getting yep I'm in there now notice as notice as this now this is the Holy Ghost Field these are the Bride of Jesus Christ these are people what God has foretold he's shown things and he's sending he says don't let these things move you amen remain unmovable unshakable amen what just like our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ what pulling strength from him yes he says and let no man deceive you by any means you you watch every word you watch every action amen praise be to God because what now remember he said there's false anointed ones coming notice the bride will be Anointed with the true Holy Ghost and those false anointed ones will still what they'll be anointed what the true Holy Ghost for the prophet of God said he says the one difference would be the teaching of it which is the ability to rightly divide the word of God Amen praise God now let me tell you you know I just had I just taught a study let's this isn't in my notes I'm going to go here let's go to I believe it it is in Luke let's turn to the Book of Luke real quick I want to show you something as this this thought comes here because I just did a Bible study and this the scripture just jumped before me it is in Luke 24 saints of God how are you not going to be deceived number one it'll take the Holy Ghost within you you must have the Holy Ghost he is the keeper right he is the keeper now between these two anointed how will you know the difference because remember it will be in the teaching how will you know the difference now what would Jesus if Jesus was here right now what would he how would he teach look at Matthew look at Luke 24 23. and when they found not his body they came saying that they have also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain members were with us went to the separate culture and found it even as the women had says but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken he says ought not Christ who have suffered these things that who entered into his glory now notice what as the Bible said if Jesus now he did not preach this but the Bible said he expounded he taught this he revealed this to him now how does how does the Holy Ghost now Christ right there had sent us a descendant now he what he was fully God Amen in flesh now how did he teach and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures he says to be the things concerning himself of what the prophet always tell us he says teach it from Genesis to Revelations from Revelations to Genesis from Genesis to revelations in what the scriptures amen praise praise me to God you want Riley dividing what the word of God even these scriptures need rightly divided amen praise be to God sure now notice in this time now notice there's going to be notice there's so much trouble he says don't let it affect you but now notice there's also a people in that same day at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ that say that I am rich and of Christ of goods have need of nothing I'll tell you what saints of God there's one thing I need and that's more of Jesus Christ I was I was driving home the other day and I and and lately I've just had some a couple actions of my things I would say not not filthy things just just uh uh things that was the old me I say like that just I I just I just cut up too much not in a perverted way just uh I should be more encouraging in Christ I should be pointing the people more to the Holy Ghost than I usually do and I kept thinking I said man I do not like this old Simon I want this thing to fully die out I know I need more I need more of the Holy Spirit I need to read another refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but now notice here he says these are blind he says wretched naked poor miserable uh and naked Jesus and they don't even know it right that is a terrible place to be in at this time right here at the time of the deception right amen so tonight I'd like to teach on this age this age by the grace of God and I've already got 18 minutes I haven't even start okay well that works out good because I Thessalonians 2 Thessalonians 2 and 9 here he says he says and with all deceivableness of unrighteous and then and then them perish because they receive not the love or the truth that they might be saved he says and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie so anyone that does not fall in love with this word does not say this is absolutely the truth this and whether they can perform it or not say Lord God I want this in my life Lord make something happen just like this right here for me Lord fulfill your word through my life just like Mary said be it unto me according what to Thy word amen but notice he says there are those that do not love the truth what God said he was what I'm going to send you a strong delusion that they should believe a lie now if there's going to be a lie coming and it's going to be so obvious to the elect but remember they're going to have their right Minds remember God keeps his own and he lets the others fall through he said if the blind lead the blind that both fall in the ditch and God allowed those things he foreordain those to be lost and he foreordained us what to his glory amen for the glory right absolutely uh Romans 9. now notice here and Romans 1 he says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen notice I was thinking about the other day when uh a man was we were talking about the word or whatever and I kept thinking man if he would ask me certain this or certain that I would just walk out to the out to the parking lot and grab a speck of grass and say our scientists can't even make this or go go to a tree limb and say all right no one can even you science can't even make this you take the basic elements of what this is made out of it they can't even you just give a bag of this and a bag of that and from the put them in the old science experiment lab or whatever and they could not even produce life being understood by the things that are made even is eternal power and godhead you get all that just from looking at nature so that they are without excuse to believe evolution there would have to be something mentally wrong with them something that says this can be created out of nothing that nothing can bring in a swore you have to be completely insane and wear that spring up all the way back in the 1800s when they still had good food but a strong delusion why because they saw it they knew there was a God it was a Christian Nation at that point many parts in the 1800s were the Russian Revival the Welsh Revival all those sort of things going on God was moving in many places and what these these Heathen these scientists or whatever would say there is no God and what God gave them up to a reprobate mind the Bible says Romans 1 and 28 even as did not like to retain God and their knowledge God gave them up to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient right professing themselves to be wise they became fools now think about the age we live in this age I was just down in Texas visiting brother Randy and I'll tell you what we need you to rest go visit him he'll sleep in with you to 10 o'clock in the afternoon in the morning and he'll wake up after you do and I said now that's my Hospitality right there that's my Airbnb [Laughter] that's a true story experience it how wonderful brother now think about this age and I was down in Texas and I was talking to a brother down there from the Philippines that goes to Brother David mcgeary's and he's been here you know a certain amount of years and we're just talking about work or whatever after church and he says he said brother he goes he goes here he says you have to work constantly to make it you have to work so much and you have to keep pushing and pressing he says it's not like that anywhere else he's been I thought about that and I'm thinking now notice this is 1959 before the 60s before rock and roll become really huge you know people under the juniper tree like is like Elijah they like to sleep I preached to more tired people than anybody in the world the prophet Malachi 4 the seventh angel Gets behind the desk and people are going [Music] was that brother Tom Brown the fell asleep during the seals the prophet of God says I preached to more tired people than anyone else in the world people is so tired they're so mentally strained 1959 I thought that was the Golden Era where you could have one in common make it just fine in the economy tired in 1959 I don't know I don't know what it's like back then all I know is what it's like right now and I'll say like this when I was an apprentice early on starting the jobs the jobs had no push behind them whenever you finish done I mean they had a goal line at a certain time they wanted a timetable they wanted to finish But as time progressed in the last 20 years the time started pressing why because they were given bonuses to the foreman to the superintendents to get a certain job done at a certain time and they would push you and push you and push you and said hey we have this date set right here and I noticed and I said I told my four minute time and I was Apprentice I said wow we're just getting pushed it's like they they want this thing done faster and faster and faster and he says I don't understand it the pressure is increasing he said there's so mentally strained until they're filling the insane institutions and hospitals everywhere they're wet in such a nervous condition until they don't know how they don't know what to believe and what they want they're just laying there they don't know what to do oh it's such a sad sight and here we are in America right now people have no idea what they want a young man about a year and a half ago killed himself and he was so depressed I said do you have a job he says no I got laid off I said well go get a job because I have pakistanis I have a a Thailand people who would love to get right here and start working and he was so depressed because his life wasn't my sister his life wasn't going the way he wanted and took his own life and yet thousands and millions of people are flooding into America looking for opportunity he has no he had no idea what he had in his hands what opportunities were given to him and he missed it he says they don't know what to do oh it's such a sad site he says he says neither can you play cars until it's dull you could take a thousand siestas and try to sleep it off he says and you can't do all these four little all these little remedies only things does is give them help the symptoms we've got to have a cure for the disease we've got he says all the psychologists the world cannot cure he says the Cure is the blood of Jesus Christ the majority every time I get a refilling of the Holy Ghost is when I feel my self-refresh I feel strong again I feel refocused why because I had a fresh experience with the presence of God himself and I'll tell you what if there's if there's anyone that can affect you it's what the Holy Ghost remember the The Works the three works of Grace are all done by the Holy Spirit the Bible says there are some that what water he said there's some that plant he says but it gave what God to give the increase amen all we do is play such a very very small part just a little infinite part of in the infantism tissimo or whatever you want to say apart just little uh a skosh or a little bit of a little bit a little bit that's all we do is a little bit and then what God takes what little we have and he multiplies it over and over and over what and what gives strength to others amen one little word good word said to this brother can expand and multiply this sister that brother this sister that brother and what God does all of it if we could just yield to give if we could just give him like the two fishes and the three loaves or however hey man now sir now notice what the Bible says in Isaiah 40 verse 28 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of heavens and earth fainteth not neither is weary then why are we so weary Saints why are we so tired I hate to call it out but just went back there and prayed and progester look at me in the eye and his right eye is twitching like this Jess I know if there's a man that's tired may God give you strength and I know what that feels like I've had that many times you can't stop it you're like foreign he says there is no searching what of his understanding he given the power to the faint this is promise for you he says and to them that have no might he increases strength where do we pull what source do we have the Lord Jesus Christ that's it the Holy Ghost he says even the you shall faint I'm only I'm only 45 and I feel old I feel tired thank you thank you brother amen even you shall faint and be weary he says and the young man shall utterly fall see the condition of that age so much pressure imagine I can't even imagine being brother Malachi's shoes right now he's got a good head on his shoulders by God's grace raised in a proper family raised under the word of God and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and now he's at an age now where he's got to he's just a couple of years away from stepping into full manhood and full responsibility he has majored pray for this brother right here he's got to choose to go to college and when you go to college you might incur that and then how you're going to pay that off then what kind of job this there's a then who now who's gonna who's he gonna who's gonna choose for a wife that is a lot of pressure in this day sisters same as well sister Lydia graduating this year big choices big decisions a lot of pressure in this day even the youth shall faint and beware in the young men shall utterly fall but they that weighed upon the Lord shall renew their strength amen should we just go say I got it I got I feel great I feel blessed you better make sure you've waited on the Lord and it's his I'll say it like this I heard the prophet of God say one day blesses her I heard the prophet God said one day he said what he said he says we need that backside of the desert experience and he says what he says he says where you've met you spoke to God and he spoke to you oh how many times have we spoken to the God but we have not heard back oh my but remember the back side of the desert is what it's a communion where you speak to him and he speaks back and give you direct orders he gives you direct directions amen he gives you a path to walk he give you instruction amen praise God but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall Mount up with wings as the Eagles the ego anointing flying high above all troubles all worries whether by by word or by or by this or by that rumors of wars and wars and famines and pestilences they shall run and not be weary they shall walk this age we're going to see something see something we can't even imagine you say brother how's that possible two thousand years ago when Jesus Christ came on the scene do you think Peter a year before the ministry of Christ was just fishing not one thing in his mind was saying I'm going to walk on water not one thing in his mind says I'm going to tell the Lord you're not going to die and he's going to call me Satan he's gonna he's and he went right through it he kept on chugging along he says he says I understood that wasn't me that was the Devil in Me amen oh my but there's things coming he says what they that know their gods shall do exploits do you think Joshua following Moses knew he was going to speak to the Sun and to the Moon and say Moon and Sun stand still that never even crossed his mind so where'd that thought come from it came from above amen it came from what the master of the Sun and the Moon amen praise be to God that's where the inspiration came from why because what God is not weary and he's not faint amen praise be to God Amen it's coming and full expectation because when there's there's something that is that's moving it's going to put us in a press it's going to push us and it's going to squeeze out whatever's within us it's coming out Saints pretty soon whatever is within you is coming out and if the holy spirit's in there he will do the works that he needs to do he says so then I thought well what would I speak to this congregation well they're probably trained right in everything no doubt but there's a but there is a pressure on the people today he says and that pressure has no limitation or any denominational lines it has no age line it has no respect a person it's on the young and old the good and the bad it's on everybody pressure but brother the devil's really attacking me because I'm in the army of the Lord let me tell you something the worldly people get attacked just as much they come down with Cancers they have divorces they lose Finance Deals they do this they lose their houses just like they have they battle the same things we do the only thing is we have the Lord Jesus Christ we have a hope we have faith and we have what carry or Divine love amen we have the answer amen we know who to go to yes amen that's right we know exactly we have a help we have help these people dying over here in the hospital little babies dying because of cancer they got at two years old or three years old or four years old saints of God and we pray over our young ones and God heals them amen I'll come down with this or that before I just lay hands on myself and say ain't got time praise me to God and I keep marching on amen Amen Brother Ray knows about that absolutely it has no respect to persons it's on young and old good and bad it's on everybody pressure but you know a lot about a person when you see them under pressure he says a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait I don't have that weight part usually it's mostly hurry hurry hurry hurry Ram slam get her done go home and think take a nap go to sleep and then do it tomorrow same thing right you don't get that weight what's that weight I don't know anything about that Drive 90 miles an hour I don't I would try to stay by the speed limit we drive by the speed limit he says then we get home for supper and wait two hours to get ready well I usually take a nap if Lord will house that's right he says it's a time and it's a rushing speeding it gets you to a nervous tension the wives say something a little contrary and you fly off a temper husband say something you pat your foot he says well I'll tell him in the room he says well now husband I don't want no words with you go out there why are you so nervous he's what's he says I'm wife's oh why I'm so nervous see why what's the matter see it's just tension pressure the unknown why do you feel that pressure could be demon spirits on you trying to get you in a bad you're getting a bad atmosphere which is anti-word Antichrist the Devils you in other what comes from what devil whisper something you're not this and you're not that and this person thinks this about you this and what I'm creates what you and if you believe it and accept those things you're going to what come into a bad atmosphere I watch it all the time at work there's a big Sparky they big I call him big Craig Miller he's like six foot four six foot five and he walked in a day he's like he just walks over and I'm like that's a big Greg what's wrong man he's like oh nothing okay so I think up behind him and I just grab my disc and I give him a big Shake him I said hey buddy and it turns on him I needed that thank you I was like yeah hey we're brothers right he was half Mexican I'm half Mexican so we have a connection you know not a Christian but I I gotta find connection right so now we're on the same team but he really appreciate that little hug I'm hugging these people in front of everybody I don't care just hug him amen he says all this together this tension building up he says then results is it is doing something wrong doing something wrong and acting out of place that's right I've done that doing something wrong or out of place why because of the pressure what was this doing something wrong or acting on a place that deception all this pressure and then doing something out of place will come see we have to have sound Minds now he says it's them it'll attack the middle class the rich act that way it'll make the make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way he says it'll make all the good act that way because it's tension steam build up got to blow it off somewhere see you don't blow up the boiler you can lose your mind so much pressure and tension on you you can literally go insane you've got so much on your mind you can actually I just saw a thing on it where in chess there's a thing called chest blindness even the grand Masters can sit in a game and these guys have studied for years memorized everything every move but they've got so much moving in their mind they say it comes in like it's almost like a like a like a snow blindness and they'll be sitting there looking in the move and they'll actually forget how the pieces even move a grand master because there's so much on their minds so much pressure and they go they call it chest blindness and they'll lose the match the Grand Master is like in The Rook cause yet he knows everything because of the amount of pressure on the mind in their heart and as a Christian let me say like this no we're just going to get there hold on let's just let's speed up here I want to get to something here he says now notice he says and any young people that can stand in the building with their hands up all like this carrying rock and roll and stuff and being next to its insanity is dangerous we've gone the mental faculty faculties have broke down remember the tree of knowledge only goes so far and then it swings backward the knowledge of tree the tree of knowledge of what good and there's so much good so much knowledge that comes out he says and then he says it swings backward what comes to evil it has to because that's the nature of the tree it's not the tree of good and only good and good and some great it's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now he goes on talking about the women and start getting to menopause this and that earlier and earlier and earlier he says he says your mother he says my mother he's your mother stuck at about 40 to 45 50 he says my muffs my wife struck that at 35 now it's down to 20. the whole human race is rotten he says well if them physical beings of our body is tearing down like that from eating hybrid Foods tensions that's rotting it he says doesn't uh does that not also rot the brain cell you watch these modern day Catholics who debate for uh abortion for abortion and four male and female and you watch them go Toe to Toe with these people and they ask logical simple basic questions and the eyes of the people are like glazed what is a woman no I can't define that their mental faculties is gone basic not even Christian just basic logic and reasoning just gone there's nothing there is nothing to do they can't help them it's too far gone unless the Lord allows now why is it this why is this age this age why is it like this in Daniel 12 and 3. and they that be wise shall sign shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou will Daniel shut up the words and sealed the book even at the time of the end he says many shall run true and fro and knowledge shall be increased why is it a nervous age why is there so much stress and pressure and anxiety because knowledge has increased there's so much to know 150 years ago when our grandpas were farm and wheat you know what their thoughts were every day roll out of bed Mama cooked some eggs and some toast no bacon go out they start pollen fields they start hole in the ground they hook up the the horses and get the plow going the Saddles riding horses this and this and dogs and feeding chickens pretty simple stuff now when I'm on a job site I just lost my glasses when I'm on a job site I've got 500 fittings to think about I've got to reroute my mind where this is going where this is going and I gotta deal with the Sparky I gotta deal with the tin knocker I gotta deal with the superintendent he didn't like this valuation so I got to shoot it up I got to redo it tear it out this this and you're a thousand different fittings in an hour then I got an apprentice who doesn't know anything green is the grass hey sigh what about this I said bro you got to measure Off the Wall not off this he's like oh yeah and I'm like well it's an easy fix just unscrew this and measure this get your Center centers take off your takeoffs do this this throw it in there he's like okay sorry about that keep going bro what knowledge shall increase what does knowledge have to do with anything notice what the Bible says here Ecclesiastes 1 and 18 for in much wisdom is much grief he says and and he that increases in knowledge increases in sorrow for the last two thousand years every age every person thought it was the end time they literally thought that yeah but they didn't know now we know It's The End age when I come out of my first two three or four Bible studies and they broke the prophet and serpent seed and baptism my mind actually got numb we had the spiritual Amnesia lifted off and I'm like or This Is the End this is it God has already sent his prophet at the time 40 years ago and the pressure now you see no other age has this pressure nobody age knew it was the end can literally prove it through scripture can prove it through what the tapes can prove it through the videos of what the discernment line showing what the gift the the the uh the Messianic sign right there brother Jesse does the videos on it 15 signs and one one to Servant okay four has already come and gone we have the restoration of the word of God the Bible is brand new book [Applause] we know the Rapture is Among Us coming with much increase in knowledge increases sorrow the stress the worry we have loved ones our brothers our sisters our moms dads our cousins our uncles and aunts and we know there is coming a part we understand the the original mystery that Paul brought what was his mystery what the Gentiles had a dispensation what to open the door of Salvation to the gospel the Gentiles were given and they entered in we received the Holy Ghost right then but we also know that the Gentile dispensation is going to have a door go shut and at that time he that is filthy is filthy still he that is unjust is unjust still he that is righteous is righteous still and he that is Holy is Holy still amen praise God we know there's a cut-off time and we know it'll be an hour a day and here's our here's another big sign when you see that fig tree blooming right but remember God sets the stage for everything I'm going to read you a story here about this in 19 wasn't 1947-46 Israel became a nation what happened right at that time World War II right Hitler Rises up put all these Jews in the ghetto put them in concentration camps and this and this and this and all that sort of thing and the Bible prophesied they go back to their Homeland right so how did this work end of World War II the Allies come in save the Jews and all of a sudden they just fly to Israel and it's they take over did they take over right then no now they got Jerusalem back in 1967. but when did Israel get Israel back not necessarily become a nation but when did they get it back let me tell you something we were talking about restoration we have nothing to worry about let me read let me let me read this to you how did this but just might know he's very look at this program actually talked about this not crazy just I I really you misunderstood me [Laughter] Brothers yes you know what I mean right sorry my Humanity he says the moment foretold and the strategy given Isaiah 31 this is right in World War the setting in the stage of World War II Jews coming into their Homeland started in World War One he says as the Turks were allied with the Germany or the Turks they ruled Israel and Palestine for 400 years they're the Muslims British found themselves fighting against the fading Ottoman Empire in the Middle East General Allenby was charged with liberating Jerusalem and had expressed concern to his superiors about the magnitude and sensitivity of the task before him they knew this was something special now remember God has appointed men in every position at the specific time for the specific reason and they are anointed to do what they are anointed to do amen God has low he's got little guys like me and then he's got great Generals in the world Wars given Powers command forces and to bring military this military to that and what God has ordained these men the Turkish Empire was controlled had control of Jerusalem the British were planning on taking over in preparation in the defense of this Invasion the Turks planned to seal up all the gates of the city and blast open the Eastern Gate in order to to create a fortified secret supply line entrance that would come down into Jerusalem from the Kidron Valley and up through the Eastern Gate in order to create the supply line they were to blow open the sealed Eastern Gate and break an ancient biblical prophecy Isaiah 44. one and two then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary with which faces towards the east but it was shut and the Lord said to me this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter by it because the lord of the God has entered by it therefore it shall be shut the Turks that were commissioned with this task were captured the ones that were supposed to blow up this East Gate were captured and stopped just hours before the bomb could be ignited he had been ordered to take the city now this is back to the general ellenby who had been ordered take the city without firing on the people on the city how is that going to take place you know the wild men how are they going to take this city but he was ordered to do that remember it looks impossible uh what if God gives you a command remember everything that takes place of you was God ordained everything that was given you to do was God ordained God has earned the footsteps of the righteous how on Earth could this be done pray the answer came from above which perhaps did not seem to be very helpful at the time but Alan B did pray he came across the work a Bible scholar Dr H elderson eldersmith who had been studying the prophecies regarding Israel Adler Smith explained in his book from 1898 that he believed Jerusalem would be delivered by Great Britain in nineteen 17. how do you come up with that remember every age has scripture they have to fulfill Josh do you ever study uh Isaiah 3 and Isaiah Isaiah 31 and say well this is this is British but I tell you what they never looked at Revelation 13 and said this is America either they didn't know the one that came out of the water was Rome and the one that came out of the Earth was America amen praise be God they didn't know what the the the mystery of Babylon was the Catholic Church but that was for our day the Mysteries he says he believed Jerusalem would be delivered by Great Britain in 1917 he had become convinced from Isaiah 31 3-5 that the UK would play a part in the restoration of Jerusalem now notice when was this 1898 and that it would be accomplished by some kind of flying machine and he got that from the scriptures what does it say for those saith the Lord spoken to me like a lion the young lion roaring at his plate when a multitude of shepherds is called against him he will not be afraid of the voice and there's this as as birds flying not birds flying as birds flying so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem he says defending also he would deliver it and passing over he will preserve it and this doctor from the 1890s said this is going to be Jerusalem he's going to use British to do it prophesied Elder Smith had arrived at this idea idea even before the Wright brothers took their flight in 1903. saints of God God is in full control be not shaken in mind or discouragement or this or that and well they can do this and they can do that doesn't matter it doesn't matter to God Lord Jesus Christ he's laughing he's mocking them up in heaven right now he's who are you I am the Creator of heavens and the Earth but of course that is precisely what ended up happening 14 years later in 1917 planes were used but not most commonly but most not commonly but most people have never seen one this man's conviction about Isaiah 31 was allenby's inspiration he would fly planes planes over Jerusalem and drop notes written in Arabic saying surrender the city Allenby so we'd fly the planes and just drop these notes from that scripture well brother side what took place let's keep reading in the meantime General Edmond Allen being his troops were getting into position to apprehend Jerusalem Ambi was known by the As a Christian and follower of the Bible a great military man in the British Army in the early 1900s was a Christian and a Bible believer it is reported that the night before the invasion and be prayed that he might take the city without destroying the holy places he had wired London for instructions and to received a scripture verse as a reply that's where we got the scripture verse amen he was so excited about this verse that he read it aloud before all his troops that were positioned in the foothills of Jerusalem El be commanded command and deared every available aircraft to do flyover on the morning of December 10th what seemed like hundreds of planes skirted low over the Temple mount when the planes went up a cloud cover covering hid them so they were not seen so now God comes into play it says as Birds but when the Amish the ottoman Turks looked up they didn't see anything but they heard all the snowys all they heard was noise Flyers were dropped that said surrender immediately you don't have a prayer and were signed by Allenby what the general did not know is that the Turks believed in an old prophecy that they would never lose the holy city until a man of Allah came to deliver it he says according to reports the signature of Allenby on the paper drop from the sky was interpreted by them to mean the words Allah in an Arabic language meaning God and Brad and Arabic means son the son of God foreign the Turks were looking at a demand to surrender signed by Alabama the Son of God in response they hoisted the white flag and surrendered City without his firing shot [Applause] what is Israel Israel are the Servants of God and who are you but the Sons and Daughters of Jesus Christ I don't call you service I call you my sons amen you are the bride this was all set up so that when Hitler got done massacring the Jews those that were left had a place to go amen praise me to God we drew them at the propagation with a tender hand he drove him back but he had a place to prepare for them amen praise God using Gentiles for the restoration of Israel just a little bit for God's wonderful people as servants foreign this was an incredible incredible fulfillment of biblical prophecy which put Israel under Jewish man or British mandate this mandate called the Balfour Declaration called for a Jewish homeland not a state for the Homeland not a country but a Homeland and set the foundation for modern Israel Jerusalem had been under Muslim control for centuries after the Turks surrendered General Allenby mounted off his white horse why he did not want to fulfill the scripture the prophet God said all of the Jews indeed is to see a prophet and the prophet I just listened to last night he said I had my ticket I was in Cairo and I was going to Jerusalem he said I was going to display this gift and the Holy Spirit said don't you do it he says I'm gonna go anyhow I said don't do it turn back to the window people airplane says I gotta change my ticket yeah but you already scheduled to go here he says I need to change it I'm going to somewhere else now The Turk surrender General and it'll be mounted off as white horse as he enter Jerusalem through the Jaffa gay interest because he knew from the Bible that old and the Messiah will enter the city on a white horse oh yeah look at the reverence by that one Gentile General hey amen praise be to God he reverenced he knew he had nothing to do with this he just saw a miracle not one shot and he took the entire city amazing God comes in a pillar fire he comes in the pillar Cloud Hallelujah he says my chariots are right in the clouds and God what took those those British chariots and hit him right in the cloud as well amen General Allenby officially accepted the surrender at David's Tower by Jaffa gate and a proclamation was read in seven languages seven languages telling the people they would go quietly and undisturbed about their ordering business and all the holy places would be respected and here's a picture of it got off his white horse from whatever there's a horse right there but he had a white one he got off of it and he walked right in official entry Jerusalem right there be not shaken in mind or word or this hey this person doesn't know if they're a boy or girl it doesn't matter Jesus said well I will restore wait on God for God never for God hath not given us a spirit of fear you know fearful tonight nervous a little nervous or this and that and I don't know why this or that God didn't give us that fear he says but a power and of love and of a sound mind we can trust the Lord Jesus Christ in everything all we know is that when this stuff starts and the world is going crazy have the mind of Christ and what was the mind of Christ Christ knew that everything that came in his footsteps where he was going this was ordained of God and he went with it I was just reading the book of Acts Saint Paul and the spirit has bound me for Rome the spirit has bound me to go to Jerusalem and he said I got to go the Lord's well they Prophet says they'll go this one says don't go he says I gotta go and he goes and what takes place he started preaching and whether you're about ready to kill him and then boom someone no someone anointed in the in the castle came and rescued Paul brought him into the council said what are you doing he said just give me a chance to speak to them you know all God wants us to do what did Paul do he said what did the Holy Ghost tell Paul he says thou has been a witness where's the third pole it'll be for the bride but it'll also be for the Eternal loss is it could it be just something as simple as laying your testimony down being a witness to the Lost being this and this and God said he says that will also testify me in what in Rome see how simple this is we've just got to open our mouths laughs tell others what God has done notice here he says let those fear that fear turn unto me and those that have un have known thy testimonies let my heart be sound in thy statutes that it be not that not be ashamed Saint Paul was he ashamed he was not ashamed was Peter ashamed he was not ashamed but Saint John is ashamed he was not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen praise God he says for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he is layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his Saints if we are which we are the generation or those that go into this Rapture he is going to keep our paths our promise what is our promising stage there is a people who will not see death one of the greatest promises there is to ever given to a people Elijah never was prophesied that Elijah would not see death or even Enoch it just came to him but remember what was that God what was God doing at that time he was writing his story through people he would literally harness on to an individual and them not even knowing what they're doing and he would guide him this way in this way and this way and that way and they don't even know why their life is going that way Abraham Moses Joshua uh Joseph why am I being persecuted my own brother why are they throw me in this pit why did they put blood on my multicolored code and this and this they don't even know what's going on but God was right he was preparing his sermon he was going to preach in Luke 24. everything he wanted to preach that sermon he wanted to expound to them Luke 24. amen he wanted those there was two men on a mass that had to hear a sermon they had to hear a teaching on himself amen and he prepared all that 4 000 years of harnessing men's and women's lives so he could teach two brothers that sow did not understand the time of their day at the time of their hour you know how they knew it was God because they said did not awesome oh think about all the Lord Jesus Christ stand for those four thousand years and they just heard the complete sermon by God himself and why he just did amen I just showed it to you and every time and it was going nugget nugget nugget nugget nugget nugget nugget Christ sat down to eat and he breaks the bread and they go oh it's you and he's gone oh what are teaching did you all hear that pinch me am I away hey man almost done Saints council is mine and sound wisdom God hath given us a sound mind I am understanding

prophets on the scene of Mount Transfiguration look at the condition of the disciples in that hour of our Peter and they they're with them were heavy with sleep we're ordained you this is how we're supposed to be we didn't choose it this is our shadow and type right there God left that in the scripture they left that in the what the holy script the script means written at the time right because the Scrolls is written in there what does the display to show us that at this time we'd be tired wore out greatest battle the mines ever fall pressures from every angle the hardest time for Jesus praying in the garden Gethsemane where he died out Christ is making his final move his final decision to fulfill the word of God he beat the flesh he built he beat his own will the human will of I don't want to die but then the Bible said with joy he went towards it once he died of that he says I'm going to suffer but the result is going to be magnificent let's find it he says now notice verse
