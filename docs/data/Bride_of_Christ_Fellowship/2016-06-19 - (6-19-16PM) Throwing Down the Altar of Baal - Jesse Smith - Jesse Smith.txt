Darkness the Marise god let's take our Bibles here thank you brother what a wonderful servant Lord you are thank you for putting up with me praise God okay like to take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace if you just stand in honor of the reading of the word I'd like to U change my thought tonight you know thought about going into I want to maybe go into Ephesus but I'd like to uh take that thought on uh Groves and Bale Idol bail so i' like to just call this a little I'm just going to start tonight uh and let's go to Judges chapter six we just call it throwing down the altar of Bale just want to look at that here tonight this thought was inspired from like I said a message out Minnesota and then brother Dale Smith shared a few things with me so I'm not done with the study yet but I just want to get a start on it tonight and then when I you know Minister on next time um we'll be able to just quickly backr because just to say my voice I just want to preach maybe about 45 minutes okay I want to put a little cough drop in my mouth you know when it's done then I know I'm ready no really I want to try to preserve my voice I wrote it I have asked God to help me uh spare my voice so I can keep making videos and preaching and song what I need to but Judges chapter 6 please verse 25 just a beautiful text here so as you're aware you know um to apply this to today as I want to I just want to uh study as I've studied on Bale I'm just bringing out how ba worship is disguised today that's kind of what I'm I'm getting at because as I study baale I see a lot of the same Spirits uh working today just just without the name Baal uh and baalism you know worship of Baal was rampit uh the time of Israel and so you know most people most churches today don't bow down to Baal but when they accept many of these spirits and do the worship of Baal um then they're really worshiping that you know the spirit Antichrist spirit Spirit of s but uh it used to be called baale uh and now some people still worship of course baale but what I'm seeing a lot of these worship sacrifices they made it's it's see it's visible today and so I want to start on that and then I'll get later onto the other portions on Bale okay judges 6:25 we'll just start with there and we'll read that in verse 28 and it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto him take thy father's young bulock even the second bulock of seven years old and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath cut down the Grove that is by it and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bolock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the Grove which Thou shalt cut down isn't that great how God uses uh materials that belong to the enemy for his glory here they're going to use wood that was cut down for the as part of the Grove for the wor of Bale and they're going to use that for the worship of the Lord that reminds us how Goliath I'm sorry Goliath sword was used by David right that sometimes the weapons of the enemy or the the tactics of the enemy can be turned around and used by God for good verse 27 then Gideon took 10 men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night when the men of the city arose early in the morning Behold The Altar Bale was cast down and the Grove was cut down that was by it and the second bolock was offered upon the altar that was built let's just have one more word of prayer if we can just bow our heads here tonight pray here Heavenly Father Lord we love you again tonight thank you for this word thank you for the songs that we sung break this word to us Lord we know we're not gathered in vain Lord we're just so grateful to be here I pray you speak to your children here God and Lord help us as we go through this to recognize this Spirits uh that used to be recognized as baale worship and help us to recognize them today dear Lord and uh Lord it'll strengthen us it it'll help guide us Lord further into the true worship of Jehovah which we know is Jesus Jesus is salvation we thank you dear Lord for your mercy and your love and I just pray you speak to us here tonight bless your saints that are pressed out and anyone that's live streaming in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen am amen God bless you VNC praise God okay so I just want to start like I said I'll try to uh I'm even going to start the timer here just so I can I really I really do got to take better care of myself God knows that I really do I had a whole week and a half off of preaching and now my voice is already hor just from preaching one time so I really got to pray and ask God to help me by God's grace yeah brother Craig can come in here and brother Brooks can come in here preaching two services and they they're a little horse but they can still sing preach and I I can barely talk I think I've done worn out my voice and really God touch me and helped me by his grace I was listening to you know I went on my computer and I was listening up see I wanted to see a sermon I preached a while ago about U Pick up the pen and write and I listened to it and my voice was so loud and so strong I thought boy my voice is really struggling right now so I can tell it's gotten weaker and weaker as time goes on because I've been teaching in the new Bible club and all that you know so just kind of takes a wear and tear on me but uh anyway I do want to make sure I don't go too long here I just want to start on this thought now uh I got kind of two two uh definitions on Bale I got one from the Bible dictionary and then the britanica and then what I'll do is after I get the definitions down uh we'll see how it's in the scripture and we'll look at Gideon um and I want to bring in this little thought that brother Dale showed me because Dale the Dale went to a museum uh he was preaching he said somewhere overseas and they had a museum of what baale worship really was like in the days of Egypt and different places where they had bail worship um and it was pretty awful but I want to first show a little background here okay so here this this is the smiss Bible dictionary it says Baal is the chief male deity and ashth uh is the chief goddess of the Canaanites and the Phoenicians okay so maybe it wasn't in uh Egypt maybe it was just in the Holy Land there near the Holy Land Canaanite I can't remember exactly where he saw but he was in some born country they had a a a museum where it it had a reconstructed alter of baale okay and it was all drawn out okay now um Bale means Lord in the sense of owner or possessor okay so that's what it just means Lord now this Bible dictionary says terrible licentiousness which is lustfulness or lustful acts fleshly desires was not only sanctioned as part of baale worship but it was the a part of the formal worship of Baal okay so terrible acts of lust of the flesh were a part of the worship of Baal uh and then he goes into you know the plague from Jehovah that destroyed 24,000 Israelites and numbers we we going to get to that eventually uh that was Bale peor right Bale peor um so I got a few things on that as well now peor is just a mountain peak in Moab okay so I looked this up as well what I always wonder what Bale peor was and different places I'm sure you're familiar with in the Bible they're called Bale something right Bale peor they Bale all kinds of different because I looked up Bale and studied a little bit of the scripture so a lot of places were named because of the Bale worship and So ba was another Lord uh another God he's the male deity uh and now as far as Bale peor the Bible says sorry the Bible dictionary says it's a mountain peak in Moab belonging to a certain range I'm just now the prophet balum was conducted by bik that he might look upon the whole host of Israel and curse them from Bor so from this mountain peak Okay so want to look at that here and uh glean some truths from this uh so we're famili familiar with it by the grace of the Lord because I think it'll be be a real good help to you because we start seeing like I said we'll get into all these things so Bor was worship uh where balum taught the children of Israel uh to worship falsely now let's see how he did it so let's go to numbers 31 please 15 and 16 this is a striking thing like we said balum is always a striking figure in the scripture because he had visions and God talked to him face to face uh well kind of like that I guess Vision to Vision we'd say U and yet he could be so anointed by God to see visions and get in entrance as the Bible said and yet he would turn around and do witchcraft and all kinds of things and the Bible said you know before he met with Jehovah he was into Witchcraft and other things and enchantments that's the word enchantments so now after if you're familiar with the story after baric asked uh uh balum to to curse Israel what did Bam say he said no he said whatever God has said that's what I'll do whatever God said that's what I'm going to say now what he did though was the Bible said it even calls it out in the Revelation uh the teaching of Baal the teaching of Baal was to teach the Servants of God to fornicate now if your numbers 31 and 16 so this is what he does he balam cannot curse and say thus sayith the Lord I'm going to curse Israel he can't do that because whatever God is blessed he can't curse Glory God's blessed our lives amen so they can't be cursed but what he does what he can do is teach them false Doctrine and that's what balum does so we really got to be careful with false Doctrine especially with marriage and divorce okay because look what what he says Moses is instructed by God on what to do with these women that were left over the ones that have had fornication the ones that had not had fornication so look at verse 15 and Moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of Israel who caused them the women so balam's Ministry after he couldn't curse Israel was to go into these moabit women and teach them how to seduce Israelite men to have fornications or adulteries so see he was a special uh he had a special Ministry to the women right of Moab oh this this dirty dirty dirty false prophet bam was right Bible said the myth of of darkness is reserved forever form him so we know he was lost yet he talk he talked with God through visions and so forth so Moses says are the women alive behold these cause the children of Israel through the Council of balam so balam's Ministry was working on the women to let them what learn how to be sexy teach them how to uh temp men and so forth or maybe uh you know we can just kind of interject some thoughts or maybe just to have them uh condone sexual acts whatever more you know to leave their husbands like I said this ties in with marriage and divorce because if people aren't careful if they're not right with the word of God they could preach in such a way where a man would divorce his wife and marry another well and if it was against the word of God what have they done they've done the same exact thing through the false conso of a false teaching of the word of God they've caused people to commit fornication right that's why with marriage and divorce we wait upon the Lord so it was through the women so bal's Ministry was a Ministry to the sisters right he he deceived them finishing verse 16 to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and every kill every woman that hath known Man by lying with him but all the women children that have not known a man by ly with him keep alive for yourselves okay now let me just pause right here I want to share uh the the history that brother Dale shared with me while we were at Outback Stak house there U just talking because that morning I'd preach on Gideon okay now let me get back up a little bit with Gideon now how you Lear the story of Gideon I went and did research on Gideon according to the Bible it had been 47 years since there was a miracle in Israel when Gideon was on the earth now I'm not sure how old he was when uh that come along but if you go back and look in judges 5 Deborah uh and uh was it baric or Bao I'm not sure which one B uh they had gotten a victory remember and by Deborah's prophecy and they had sung the songs and the Bible said because of that Miracle they had peace for 40 years right and then the Bible said in chapter six that they went and worshiped baale uh and because of that God let them become impoverished by the mid minites for how many years seven so 40 plus seven if you just the Bible doesn't record another miracle for 47 years now there may have been but we know there was no deliverer because that's what the Bible That's the purpose of the judges right to show the deliverers from Israel okay so it had been about 50 years since there was a miracle a real move of God stirring of God because God gave them peace for 40 years and sometimes Church don't we enjoy that don't we enjoy peace when we get a great Victory and God gives us Deliverance in our lives don't we enjoy the peace that it brings sometimes you wonder why why is it more going on well sometimes God wants us to just enjoy peace Glory thank God for that okay so been 47 years now and then brother brother BR says and the Bible says it too but I'm just you know going off the sermon 1961 it was uh December 30th I'm sorry December 31st 1961 they had the watch Night Service where brother BR preached that God be with us whever all the Miracles okay so I'm just I'm pulling quotes out of there but brother BR said because uh of the impoverishment of the midianites the people began to cry out to God and the Bible say God sent them a prophet right God sent them a prophet and because uh of their sin the prophet rebukes them he said you haven't remembered Joshua you haven't remembered Moses and he said the reason uh this impoverished happened is because you haven't obeyed the voice of the Lord so let's go back there let's go to judges six so we can just hit that highlight there trying to build up to that to kind of show you U where this thought came from and I really want to like I said I really want to dig into the word and uh really study on bail worship because like I said I just gave you one example of how bail worship allowed fornication amongst people that uh uh should not have done it even the Israelites that had the word of Moses even they got seduced by it so it must be preached it's important uh by God's grace okay so judges 6 I'm sorry I turned the wrong way here now the prophet is said at the beginning of the chapter there Judges chapter 6 and uh verse eight that the Lord sent a prophet under the children of Israel now go down to verse 10 and I said unto you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice so the prophet comes to say you know God has been Supernatural among you he's done great things he's delivered you but you haven't obeyed the voice of the Lord so every time God's people backslide what does God do send a messenger to get them to repent amen praise God and we're grateful for that and brother R said look the Bible never gave his name and he said I'm sure that's how the prophet wanted it because a real Prophet doesn't want any Glory right he wants God to get the glory now brother Randon makes a statement I don't have the quote in front of me but he makes a statement he said I am telling you this to encourage heard you he said that as soon as a prophet leaves the scene God comes on the scene Glory so what of I I'm typing this to today and that's where we can type Gideon's Ministry to today because a prophet came and preached when the people cried out you know because churches went denominations and churches uh uh you know the Roaring 20s and all these things like that all the wickedness and all so forth that rose up sexual Revolution and here God raises up a prophet with the sword of the king he gives his message even marriage and divorce and goes off the scene and now say I'm going to encourage you as soon as a prophet leaves God himself comes on the scene because the angel of the Lord comes under Gideon Hallelujah that's a beautiful type and brother Graham gave that type and the people really enjoyed that when we ministered that it was a real blessing for me to see that as well okay so now now I'm sure he's I'm sure starting to get familiar with you right so uh we know he's you know at the threshing FL he's trying to hide his his uh his crops you know from the minites and the Lord comes and says you're a mighty man of Valor and he said if God With Us where all the Miracles okay so we know this um and then uh Gideon says wait right here I want to bring you a present and by this I'll know that you you're sent from God okay because he doesn't realize this as an angel yet uh because later he realizes it so what happens is uh he starts asking God for signs I don't know if if everybody's been listening to the Ephesians services but brother brandom said the Corinthian Church was a church that needed signs he said they always had to have a tongue always had to have a Psalm always had to have a prophecy he said the Ephesian church was not that way the Ephesian Church could just hear the word and believe it and move on with God but he said the Corinthian Church had to have something Supernatural something loud or some song or some type of sign uh in order for them to know it was God and brother Bram said that's fine he said God will work with you whatever way you are amen now listen I should say listen this is important to me because I've asked God for signs before okay and so I relate to Gideon a lot okay I don't know if you have or I don't know which one of us but I have asked God for numerous signs okay the one sign was should I be a pastor I don't know if I told you this I was sitting on top of in I was sitting in the bathroom I think I was sitting on the side you know where where the tub is I think I'm just sitting there rest I think I just you know helped Lydia at the restroom when she was little before he started the church you know and she walked out and I'm just reading my Bible I'm like Lord do we start a church or not so I just was praying I was real sincere cry almost crying I said Lord just show me and opened up my Bible I just I need a sign from you and the first scripture was the one about Timothy where Paul told Timothy don't let any man despise your youth but you be the example uh and that right there quickened it to me yeah thank you Lord I must be an example as a as a minister as a preacher here in a and then the other most important one well the other one was am I called to preach uh this was before the one I just told you about so I preached one sermon in acon brother Tim Myers encouraged me to preach and like I told Brother Benjamin last night when we were fellowshipping I said brother I said when I was in school I or I growing up I never thought I'd be a preacher but as soon as I got in the message and I heard Samuel brownie preach and brother Donnie Reagan I knew I was going to be a preacher something in me was just pulling I I was like I'm going up there one day I just had wait a few years you know so I heard it 2001 I started preaching in 2004 so I just waited three years there but I knew I didn't tell anybody I didn't brag about it I just knew there's a call for me I gotta go up there it was like when I was hear brother Donnie Preacher Brother Samuel I wasn't nervous about like I knew I I've got to go up there too um but after I preach preached my first sermon in akan brother Brooks called me up and he said brother I heard you preach brother Tim told me you preach would you like to preach in aan I said well I'm ly up I said well if it's the will of the Lord so I prayed about it and I was humbled by that and I just asked for a sign and uh it was a it was a PM service and I asked the Lord uh Lord if you're in this speak to us uh and I fasted a couple days in the week beforehand just praying asking God my title was a deep and desperate call okay I preach said there and uh that was a sermon where brother Stephen said he got Victory he got deliverance from video games that Ser I remember him at the altar weeping and crying that was really wonderful okay but anyways I was in the AL I was in the um the pastor study beforehand I just said Lord Give Me A Sign I need a sign and God knows after we sang uh Amazing Grace should always be my song of Praise I Ste at the altar or the pulpit rather and we just had a prayer and as soon as we got in with the prayer I announced my text and sister Karen gave like a word of knowledge it must been a word of knowledge or a word of discernment or something and it basically was for telling about what was going to be preached on and then I preached on it it was really wonderful and then the whole altar was filled I remember just going back and forth I was just cross and so amazed like man what are all these people I can't believe they're all touched by the word of the Lord you know and that was another time I asked for a sign the next one was the one about brother amen most you know about that I said Lord if you don't give me a sign or give me a soul I think I'll just go into evangelism because it seemed might that might be the best thing to do uh because I was just kind of discouraged you know about the church and things like that and then God gave me brother amen so what I'm saying just I'm just saying all that to say that if you need a sign from God God will work with you with your sign aren't you glad he does that I'm so glad he does it uh but brother ad said just don't don't try to figure out just wait for God to show you he said he might not speak it to your ear but he might show you sometime throughout the day so we just got to ask God for it and then wait upon it oh the other one was the church when we rent into the second place that we rented in that old garage remember that uh that morning I I was praying and fasting I said Lord if you want us to rent that place bring it to pass and just a few hours later I got a call saying you know we'll give it to you for this price and we'd like guys to rent it and so forth like that so I that was a sign God gave me immediately right away answer to prayer okay so his Gideon's first sign was the present which it would have took two or three hours to uh to prepare this meat and broth and so forth and it was a burnt offering it was a peace offering and a drink offering a meal offering as well all those into one and remember fire comes out of the rock so the fire comes out of Christ because Christ is The Rock right 1 Corinthians chapter 10 fire Holy Ghost fire comes out of the Rock and consumes the sacrifice glory and then he knows he's in the presence of an Angel okay now a second sign he asked for uh the fleece uh the fleece on the wool and the floor if the D be on the fleece only it would be dry upon the Earth and it was so okay so the do was so the fleece was wet now the third sign was uh where it was wet on the ground and not on the fleece okay so look he he's asking God first three times he's asking God for signs and God gives him every sign because he's called of God and that's what we can expect God's called us to be the bride of Christ we can expect God to give us our signs right now the beautiful one later is in the is in chapter uh seven yeah chapter seven God gives him an option do you want to sign I don't know if you ever knew that so he asked for three signs so God just keeps working with him with signs that ought to be an encouragement to us church if God's worked with us with signs before he'll keep working us with signs okay so it's in chapter 7 verse 9 and it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto him arise get thee down into the host for I deliver into thine hand but if thou fear to go down go thou with furah thy servant down to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down into the host then went he down with furah his servant unto the outside of the Armed men that were in the host isn't that isn't that kind of God God looks down at Gideon's heart and he says You' still got fear in your heart and your hands aren't very strong you got weak hands still after all these victories because remember his church went from 30,000 down to 300 how many do that that's quite a that's quite a reduction in your church services right 30,000 down to 300 that's right so I'm sorry I think it was 32,000 down to 300 if I'm not mistaken so God says I still I see you still have fear so in order to help you be strong and not doubt if you want it you go down to the tents and listen and I'll strengthen your faith in other words I love how God works with us right and even when we're weak God will encourage us to be strong and not fear amen he'll give us the vindications we need he'll give us the strength that we need so God gives him that and most of you are familiar with maybe some of you aren't but he goes down there and he starts listening into the tents of the mid nights and one of the guys wakes up and says I had a dream I had a dream that a barley cake a big barley loaf rather was rolling down the mountain and it knocked over our tents and this was the this was the the word of the Lord through Gideon and Gideon hears it and the Bible said he fell on his knees and started worshiping the Lord for this fourth sign that he had and he starts giving God praise he goes up there and say we got the victory I thought that was a beautiful type what's what's what's a loaf in the Bible anybody know it's a body because the Bible says you are the bread right that's the Bible says that in First Corinthians that we are the body we are the bread so it was showing that Gideon's uh 300 Gideon's body of Believers was GNA continually keep uh pick up speed and was going to destroy the armies of the enemy praise the Lord and we are the body of Christ so we can expect not an individual Ministry to overcome Satan but we can expect a body Ministry Hallelujah the five-fold ministry the church the Le all the songs musicians everybody working together we can expect like Gideon after the prophet left the scene glory after the prophet leaves the scene we can expect God to work with us to have a body Ministry picking up speed getting closer and closer to the Lord and overcoming the enemy amen glory I like that now that's just a short one review of it but um hope that was a help now in chapter six go back to judges six now this is what I want to share this was our text now we read 28 through uh I'm sorry 25 and uh down to 30 I think it was pardon sorry I'm a little confused up there had the different scriptures copied and pasted there yeah okay yeah 25 26 27 okay all right now this is throwing down the altars of Bale okay now we read that for our text now after Gideon is aware now that God is with him the next step that he knows God is with him is to clean out his house right I preach on that over at brother cams and Minnesota when we preach on the sword Lord and Gideon once God gets you in his hand and you know God's with you then he asks you to clean out your house praise God and uh he didn't say you know it's an option Gideon for you to clean up he said you must in order for you to defeat the midianites and drive them out in order for you to be a deliverer of your people you've got to clean out the Abominations of your father now I'll say like this for us some of us might not live with our fathers not might might not live with our mothers but we got to go we got to get the Traditions that they might have instilled in us that weren't okay with the word of God that didn't line up with God's word okay like I think of you know the M culture I think of brother van I think of you know different Traditions that they have as we talked some of them don't line up with the word right I think of my traditions I had growing up the tradition of you know watching too much Sports you know and uh all kinds of evil things like that it's still a tradition right you know it's still something you do that you just always do you just you always do that well it needs to be cast out in Jesus name amen so that's that's what we're getting at we're looking at types like this now for those of you uh remember Gideon's dad had an altar of Bale okay and around it was a Grove and of course a Grove is like a a small Forest we'd say uh where trees have grown up and then you have inside of it uh under rather under this canopy or protection of Grove of a Grove you have an altar of baale now here's where I want to get to with brother Dale's testimony the day I went to this Museum and had a a whole set up of of Bale worship and here I'm going describe it in a little bit more gentler terms Bale worship was so evil uh at least in this area like I said I don't remember the area where it was which country but he said it was so evil it started off as small things for example you would just bring food to baal's altar okay and you would sacrifice food you leave bail You' leave bail some food or something like that but the deeper you got involved into it it got you more and more uh more and more sinful he said and at the advanced stage they would start sacrificing their own children okay uh and then and so here here's here's what he read and brother Dale is a really thorough man I need to ask him for the reference what I need to do I talked to him yesterday I didn't ask you he said their main festivals they would have uh underground or kind of like ditches built okay leading up to the Altar and they would take their children and kind of uh guide their children through the waters to clean them as a sacrifice which was totally awful and then they would uh once they were washed and clean then they would offer them and kill them unto baale now that's awful right but what do we have in our country abortion right so can everybody see that same Spirit of murder there it's not called bail today right it's not called bail worship today but it's still Antichrist Spirit right it's still murder so once you got to be an advanced bail worshipper certain festivals throughout the the year you would bring your children and he said he read all about this and it was all you know uh reference and everything like that and then once the children were gone what they would do is they would engage in more types of drugs they would have drugs as part of their worship and then they had three or four days of we'd say uh sexual sins okay and then brother Dale read in these certain tribal peoples or whatever more many STDs would break out and the people would be plagued and they had no reason why they would they would have no idea why and so this is what baale worship led to okay it started off really simple and small and then pretty soon you're just giving you know your your finances to that church or whatever more and then pretty soon it starts killing your family then it starts killing you okay so I wanted to bring that out and when he said that I was like M now I can start seeing how these things have become a part of uh you know certain churches we'd say that condone certain sins now let's do this here let's uh turn to a few scriptures here now and uh I want to look at let's look at some of this B worship I want to read I have one two three four five I have six examples so let's go to numbers 25 first here's the the fornication and adultery here let's let's look at this here we read a little bit about it earlier Bor but let's start right there let's continue on that rather numbers 25 and there's a this is a huge subject because Brother Band mentions uh Bale and asth in the church age book about 15 times he said that was the spirit that got into the Catholic Church okay and that's what we see there so I'm not going to be able to go get there I didn't study far enough on it but I just kind of looked ahead a little bit to see where it would lead the study would go numbers 25 okay now one through 15 are all good and then 16 and 18 uh we don't have time to read all that here okay let's just read one through three here and Israel Abode in shm and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab and they called the people unto the sacrifice of their gods and the people did eat and bow down to their gods so they don't start with the fornication right they start with eating they start with feasting they start with just having Fellowship right what we would call Fellowship uh so get they get them to eat and then once they eat they get them to bow down and after they bow down then they commit these sexual acts doesn't that sound very similar to what brother Dale described to me in the museum sounds very similar you start with food and you do the worship and all these things these rituals and then comes the uh the fornication acts and so forth verse three and Israel joined himself un Bor and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel now I don't know what the plague was that broke out of Israel but can you kind of get an idea here what kind of plagues might break out the Bible might have called STS plagues right we don't know for sure it seems like it but now we can understand why would God kill 24,000 people that went to Bale peor well it's probably because these diseases spread and because it was getting it could not get amongst the True Believers right it was spread amongst those that were disobedient and so forth like that but God wanted to keep the people pure from those things so God allowed them of course you know to uh to kind of cleanse the the the the group there now let's go to verse 16 numbers 25:16 remember this is after Phineas had taken the spear and threw it through uh uh the two that were in the tent one's the Israelite leader and other one was a motis or midan itish woman sorry okay verse 16 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Vex the midianites and smite them for they Vex you with their WS wherewith they have beged you in the manner of peor in the manner of Cosby the daughter of the prince of Midian their sister which was slain in the day of the plague for peor sake okay so I hope everybody can understand this now this is just one of the ideas of baale worship here now brother Rand says this is what the god of Satan is the God of this evil age and brother brandom uh of course preached how this is Satan's Eden which is people going to a church that looks like a Christian Church chur but yet worshiping Satan okay so when a church preaches false Doctrine it's like a balum spirit right uh that allows them to commit fornication that's why it's so important that we have for or I'm sorry so important that we have marriage and divorce down pat we got to have it down pack we can't have divorces and remarriages and all these things and marrying people that have already been through different relationships and things like this it's got to be done right with the word can you say Amen so see I believe if marriage and divorce is misinterpret it it becomes a spirit of bail right a spirit of false Doctrine and it brings pollution to the church now I'm at 32 minutes just give me about 10 more minutes like I said we'll try to go about 45 by God's grace so it was like this either kill them right like Phineas or they're going to kill you they'll spread their evil uh to your family so God said have those 24,000 slain because the plague is spreading all because they just want to worship with him they just want to have some fellowship but sin was all behind it lust was behind it okay the next one was child sacrifice so go to Jeremiah 195 Jeremiah 195 Jeremiah 19:5 now this of course is you know further down the the the line of the timeline the times of Jeremiah but this again backs up what the brother had seen in the museum there let's read verse three though because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known nor the kings of Judah and have filled this place with the blood of Innocence okay so innocent Souls innocent people they have built also the high places of ba to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto ba which I commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind amen this is a good scripture right here to prove how children are innocent before the Lord did you catch that Glory they filled their place with the blood of Innocence well the only innocent ones could be those who either repented right or those who are not aware of their sin nature yet like children this scripture proves that okay and then this backs up the history that brother Dale saw there remember and then the Bible said it was the most Lous type of terrible sins okay so now we have fornication adultery bowing down eating sacrifices unto their gods child sacrifice as well and like we saw with abortion it happens in America and I've seen some different memes on Facebook and they're all many of them are true uh like they say you know one one child was uh one gorilla is killed right because of a child remember that at the zoo a few weeks ago one one gorilla's killed everybody gets upset but yet there's 10,000 abortions done and nobody says a word isn't that hypocritical by that's that's true bail worship here in the US amongst the Sinners uh that do those type of things okay so child sacrifice is part of bail worship and what is it the churches allow it right the churches say oh it's okay you know it's okay it's not really a human being yet there's some churches that allow that and it's right there it's it's disguised as a real worship when it's not okay now uh the food and gold and silver sacrifices is in Hosea 2 and8 Hosea Daniel Hosea so if you got that Hosea 2 and8 let's read through that I just found it very striking here that they would the Bible would have all these descriptions of baale worship and then our brother saw the same thing I just thought it was very striking to me verse eight Hosea 28 for she did not know that I gave her corn and wine and oil and multiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for baale see God had blessed them with crops you know uh corn oil silver and gold and all these precious metals but yet they chose instead instead of enjoying them or the blessings of God they chose to give them unto baale that's right so see this is all part of the worship it might start off as small things maybe eating and bowing and just being around it we have to be careful who we associate with even in the in the message denominations especially if there's false Doctrine you got to be really careful about that and like I said I'm not being not having try to be a critical spirit I'm trying to save people's lives right we're trying to save people's lives and keep them pure okay now here's one that's quite familiar First Kings 18:26 but I'm GNA approach it a different way First Kings 18:26 okay these are the prophets of Baal in the time of Elijah and Jezebel and Ahab and remember they were worshiping Baal they were Baal prophets 26 through 28 okay and they took the bulock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of balum I'm sorry ba from morning morning even until noon saying oh ba hear us but there is no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god neither he is talking or he is pursuing or he's in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awake and they cried aloud and cut themselves after the manner with knives and Lancet till the blood gushed out upon them okay so one of the more of the characteristics of male worship is it can have more physical movement than the true worship right we don't did you see uh remember brother Brooks mentioned this when he was here he said do you ever see Elijah jumping around leaping around no he just knew what God was going to do now did David leap and dance sure did the man that was healed the gate a beautiful leap and dance sure but in this case they had more outer worship than even Elijah had so it's not on of course outer worship and then they had cutting of themselves and that's where we get any type of cutting of yourself now we today will see it as tattoos or earrings or any other self mutilation now I'm going to bring out one here Church there's a self mutilation going on that I'm not sure if you're familiar with but it's when a man or a woman have surgeries in order to stop having babies now that's that's pretty serious now the reason I believe now that just might that might be my opinion but listen I like anyone to show me any Scripture where God says to stop having children and I've asked people this and people have come to me and said well yeah brother J I know we disagree we talked about this before he said but I just feel like God told me we're done I said that's fine you you gotta go with whatever leadership you have but I said show me that in the Bible okay show me in the Bible where God said it's okay I I don't want you have no more children now it's possible God may do that but what is I'm saying is that people so often can't find the will of God for different things in their lives am I called to preach am I called to need them I called you this but yet when it comes to children they can find the will of God right away after having two kids oh we're done or one kid we're done we're gonna have surgeries and they cut themselves and brother Ben this might be wrong but I think it's right and you can maybe ask your parents but when I talk to my parents my dad is the youngest of 10 children 10 my my grandparents had children until they couldn't have anymore my mother is the third child of eight and they had one die by uh died after birth so I'm saying like this brother bang s Wendy our generation is the first generation that's really had all these mutilations and these selfs surgeries right because the generation before us well my dad well actually maybe it was my dad generation I should say it like that maybe it was my dad the Baby Boomers maybe it was the Baby Boomers they're the first ones who come out and say we're gonna try to limit our family number because of financial concerns right or because we can't handle children but if you just go two generations back from my generation two generations go back to my grandparents in America they're still having as many children as they can have now you tell me and I've heard uh medical things a medical report say this too uh show me one other country outside of westernized cultures show me one other country that has surgeries to limit the number of children no other countries have it Africa don't have it right all these other countries that are not westernized because they value life they value children they value families but look at the countries that are so intellectual and westernized and all these things like that they try to limit the number of children through what self-mutilation they have someone cut on them in order to limit the images of God that come out of them right because every child is the IM is in the image of God I know that's rough I Don't Preach that too often but it ties in perfectly here they sacrifice bigger families for what the benefit of finances can everybody see that that's why they do it and isn't it sad Mercy I know like in China what they have a limit of two children or something like that I'm not sure one one oh my goodness um Mercy Lord uh how many years have they done that you know Russia I know Russia had a limit at one time different places have had limits we don't have a limit here but it's the same idea because of the pressure of whatever they feel uh they just they they self- cut them they get they get cut they basically get cut in other words they get mutilated in order to stop having images of God come forth and that's wrong so that's what I said and then they and then they uh and then it's okay from the pulpit the churches allow it and they Don't Preach against it so like I said it's okay to limit children if Mom's going to die if there's a a there's a there's a concern mom might die brother said yeah then then you might want to limit the number of children but again just if we if we're going to be Bible Believers and take everything back to the word let's find it in the word of God okay so that's where I'm taking that one self mutilation like I said earrings tattoos anything cutting on the body and then of course and even in child sacrifice so I think child sacrifice and self mutilation that kind of goes together they're not afraid to be cut uh for the wrong reasons okay just two more here I'm at 42 minutes so we'll finish up with these by God's grace okay so Jeremiah 12:16 now this one I hope you'll understand this one okay this in this case they had to make a promise or swear by the name of Baal 2 Kings 10:22 sorry I was turn the wrong here Second Kings 10:22 because we don't want any false Spirits in here uh we don't want any false Doctrine for it'll produce death false Doctrine produces death uh spiritually it's fornication spiritually against the Lord so we must stay with the word of God Second Kings 10:22 and he said unto him that was over the V bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of ba and he brought them forth vestments did I get the wrong one G read 23 and J went and jadab the son of re Rich into the house of ba and said unto the worshippers of Baal search and look that there be here with you none of the Servants of the Lord but the worshippers of Baal only okay this is where he tricks them and then slays all the baale worshippers Glory okay I must wrote the wrong scripture I'm sorry about that that's where he exterminates baale worship amen uh okay I think I got it mixed up okay this is this yeah this is the special clothing I'm sorry this is special clothing yeah this is vestments this is not swearing by his name this is vestment okay so again they had special clothes for worshippers of Baal that weren't your regular Israelite clothes okay doesn't that remind you of achen right the Babylonian G and so see what is that tying with our modesty standards right they had special clothes okay and prostitutes are known in the Bible for what uh uh wearing gold and too much expensive jewelry making the outward more important than the n-word okay so see your clothing bail worship impacts your clothing as well gives you different clothing special clothing than what you normally wear as a follow of Jehovah so they change they change so much and here's the last one they swear by his name Jeremiah 12:16 yeah that's it sorry Jeremiah 1216 now I really believe this is an inspired thought like I said because I'm seeing I've seen these and and continue to see them uh you know amongst churches and things like this when people don't take a stand or rightly divide the word of God I just thought I'd bring this out here because I want to preach more on it so the Saints can see this I'll get to the Groves the Lord willing next time hey Jeremiah 12:16 okay verse 15 we'll start there and it shall come to pass after I pluck them out I will return and have compassion on them and bring them again every man to his Heritage and every man to his land this will come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name the Lord liveth as they taught my people to swear by ba by Baal then shall they be built in the midst of my people all right so God was going to have God was going to allow some foreigners to live near Israel there as long as they were taught to honor the ways of the Lord okay that's why Jesus said go into all nations and teach them to observe all things that I command we're supposed to teach all the observations of baptism the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit any command of Jesus Christ we're supposed to teach him all amen that's not legalism because remember legalism is excessive things that are too far but to teach all the commands of Christ that's exactly what Jesus Jesus wants amen and then the Great Commission will be fulfilled all right I think we'll stop right there why don't we stand to our feet by the grace of the Lord here that's 40 I've went about 47 minutes little bit over all right yeah let's stand to our feet by God's grace and now uh as we'll get to next time by God's grace the reason this meant so much to me is because I had so many people come up to the altar when I preach this and I didn't preach on Bale worship this is all new to me but when I preached on the Groves we saw how Groves was like this Forest that was built up and Gideon Gideon's dad would sneak in there with all the men of the town if you read the scripture they wanted to kill gon for cutting down the Grove after they would do their outward religious worship to Jehovah they would sneak down into the Grove like that and they would worship baale and they would do all these evil things and what is it it was secret sin right and it kind it ties in perfectly with this morning's message anything we do in secret that we're scared of somebody finding out is a Grove in our life can everybody see that by God's grace they snuck in there did all these evil acts aail who knows what Gideon's dad was doing look at all these things that they did it kind of depending on how advanced you were you know to the Bale religion but the idea and the purpose behind this is to show you that these Spirits are still working today can everybody see how the spirits are still working and they cause people to sin secretly and if if even that advances it goes to the spot where you have like the sins of Sodom where the Bible said they're defiant and they don't care they're bold and they'll declare their sin before everybody that's Isaiah chapter 3 the Abominations they're not scared who sees them sin they so bold with their sin uh they're just prideful and arrogant against the Lord and so we want to make sure we look at that now I'm going to read one more scripture First Kings 18 so think about our lives that's why we're here think about our lives think about things that we do in the privacy of our own home that's why I brought it out B worship was connected with secret sin God didn't want secret sin God wanted public worship right God don't want people sneaking off and doing lustful things God wants everybody out in the public Everything Seen that's why I think live stream's a good thing the whole world sees what you're doing well that's how it is all no matter what right you want everybody to know that we love Jesus we're serving him we're keeping away from sin and we have nothing to hide but see when people start hiding away from fellowship hiding away from other churches right hiding and doing things there's there's a reason you need to be concerned about that and so we want to make sure we have the right Spirits okay I just want toh read this where Elijah said verse 21 Elijah came unto all the people and said how long haot you between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if baale and follow him and the people answered him not a word praise the Lord all right let's have word of prayer if we can by God's grace Heavenly Father we thank you for this word of God here tonight Lord we're looking at throwing down the altars of baale Lord we see this type of worship this satanic type of worship we can see Lord I can see and I hope to I hope it's right I hope I've tried to keep the balance of the word here Lord and try to watch and discern Spirits dear Lord as we said not to be critical but to keep others from it dear Lord and if people we meet that are caught in these things Lord we would have the heart we would have the desire to correct them and Lord the Bible says he that turns someone away from Air saves a multitude of [Music] sin Lord I imagine Lord different ones Lord I would imagine everyone there's times where Satan comes to tempt them all alone in their own little Grove Lord if it goes to sin Lord in those times where we're being tempted may we look up to you if we fallen short may help us quickly to repent and throw down any altar that might be build it up that we might be a holy vessel unto thee dear Lord keep us Lord from these spirits of selfishness Lord God keep us from the spirit of hiding keep us from the spirit of Pride to say my way is better than God's way Lord help us to walk in your path Lord [Music] and Lord as we look at this later perhaps with the rest of the church I just pray it would
