have to do oh yes Jesus tomorrow may never be back lord help me today so be the way one day at a time [Music] that's what Ephesians chapter 6 like to look at a little bit on spiritual warfare I do have lots and lots of notes on the kingdom of God and I've been preaching on that the last few weeks but I just want to start also on the spiritual warfare Ephesians chapter 6 the goal of this is that it will hopefully help us to see situations better and to see how spirits may be working in situations because eventually I want to get to there's at least 16 demonic spirits that are named in the Bible like infirmity Antichrist heir whoredoms there's all these spirits in there and when you can recognize the spirit and you're able to cast it down so I want to eventually get to that by God's grace so let's go to Ephesians chapter 6 and many of these you know of course the this can deal with your your personal battles that you have where you maybe you're getting attacked by a spirit of infirmity you can rebuke that spirit of infirmity or maybe it's someone in your family or a friend that you know or maybe it's something that comes to church and comes up here for prayer to help me as well to try to understand what spirit were we're going against by God's grace and we know like Jesus said with deaf and dumb spirits they only come out by prayer and fasting the other so they're certain there's certain spirits it's good to know what they are and then how to overcome them praise God sofie's in Chapter six sorry I just having trouble finding it there we go thinking about some other thoughts about scriptures season 6 verse 10 I'm not I'm not gonna get in the full armor of course tonight but I wanted to look at the kind of the spiritual warfare that started in heaven tonight I want to start there and then Lord willing the next few weeks continue look at these thoughts and then individual demon spirits fusions 610 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of his might how many like to feel that way you like to feel strong in the Lord I don't like feeling weak I like the unstrung verse 11 put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil let's read verse 12 together on three one two three four we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places let's have a word of Prayer if you haven't eaten your heart just make it oh no no none to God here Heavenly Father were happy to be in your house Lord yesterday's gone sweet Jesus as we just sang and tomorrow may never be mine so lord help us to take one day at a time or we want to take this day Lord and just bathe in your word and bathe in your spirit your anointing we want to be strong in the Lord and the power is might but we know we're no stronger than the word that we're living and the word that we're speaking so father help us to receive the word that we might speak it and Lord be warriors this week Lord God for the kingdom of God let us put on the full armor of God we know you'll help us Lord tonight in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god I should be in cedar praise God you know we we have a lot of privileges as Christians you know the Bible says the angel of the Lord camps around those that fear the Lord and we all remember the book of Job right how job had a hedge about him Church I'm convinced as I've been studying this this week I'm convinced God spares us from so many trials because of the blood of Christ because we believe in the blood we worship we we live clean lives right we live clean lives I'm convinced God spares us from so much trouble all because we've accepted the blood and we fear the Lord we keep his word and so he set you sets a hedge about us which I believe is like the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the angels of the Lord now what's interesting I'm not going to give this tonight but there seems like there's times when there's maybe just one angel with us where there may be times there's more than what age with us because the how many member of the Bible said when Jesus defeated Satan three times the Bible said not 1 but angels came to minister to him it took more than one angel right because he was weak and tired from all the temptations and the Bible says the angels of God ministered to him praise God so they brought some type of spiritual blessing some type of spiritual anointing praise God when when Jesus needed it and then remember Elijah when he was with Kay haze' there surrounded by the enemies member of the enemy army and gazes all nervous and Elijah prayed and said Lord open gazes eyes and so there was a huge army of angels and gazing after worry about that anymore see and then member gihan got leprosy member that because he took that gift from naman and see that that was because de Heiser should have known we're not a man didn't do this God's angels in this amen the Holy Spirit healed naman we it's a time for us to take you know these garments of blessings you know like they were a reward and so the the Lord allowed him to be smitten with leprosy because he just saw the angels of God camped around he just saw naman get healed and he should have known this is not a time for us to receive any rewards this is a time for God to get all the glory so Church we must be aware of that at all times that there's angels around us and don't forget we're in a battle praise God if we're not praying then look at verse 12 if we're not praying then there's actually a period then in our lives we actually put a period after or not right because if we're not praying it that scripture would say for we wrestle not period it's a little joke there right if we're not if we're not praying then we're not wrestling against spiritual powers see and you've known it I knowed it when we're not in the prayer like we ought to be it just seems like life's going on and what happens is we put a period there and we're not wrestling because we're not praying because a fully armored Christian prays according to the net verse 18 so once he goes through the the six pieces of armor five of them are protection what is offensive the Word of God then this the action or the seventh thing that's mentioned the completion is prayer praying all the time in all situations now it's a struggle for all of us because we know we're in a battle but see that's why we come back to the word it reminds us yes I got to pray over this yes I got to pray over this we want to pray over all things because the Bible said praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit praise God and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen now see God knows that Paul can't physically be with All Saints but his prayers are just as powerful amen because he's called to pray for All Saints even though he'll never be with them so it just proves that God wants to hear our prayers for other Christians and God will honor those prayers remember when Sampson Shetty was here a couple years ago his whole family had flu and that was on a Saturday night he preached for a Saturday night for us we prayed and he went to bed and he said we woke up he woke up and called his wife and said everybody's doing it easy and his wife said praise the Lord God heard your prayers all the flu banished overnight so here we were in India you remember that it was right in here I think it was yeah I think I was right in here and we are here in India we sent the prayers up for All Saints and God heard the prayer for All Saints amen I love that phrase God because God God would have put it in there if he's not gonna honor it so we can pray for anyone at any place and that prayer will be heard by God it's part of our spiritual warfare because we are to be wrestling against spiritual wickedness in high places amen now I want to look at this here verse 12 Ephesians 6:12 there's four levels that we are wrestling with Church if you just look at this the first one is principalities that's the first level we don't wrestle against flesh and blood principalities is the highest level powers is the second rulers of darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places now we're going to show you tonight where we're going to see the rulers of darkness of this world you know it's scriptural it is scriptural there's a demon who rules over Northeast Ohio or Ohio it's kind of hard to say or there's a demon that rules over that's why there's an opioid crisis is the worst right here in Northeast Ohio so that's something we can pray for it in this sermon and we should keep praying for it if the Lord would remind us here it's Scripture because it's Daniel chapter 10 in Scripture there's a demon power us over all these areas and we we're the ones after Russell against it praise God because remember a woman that'll cut her hair the Bible said God won't hear a prayer so who does that leave a very small group in Northeast Ohio and very small and so see if we haven't prayed for that and that's something we need to pray for this is all this evolving fresh to me I haven't really understood this till recently I've been listening to some sermons and looking up quotes and reading a book about this see there's rulers of darkness of this world there's levels so this is probably the highest level Satan's pride the principality level because he's the the chief demon all of them he's the ruler of all because he deceived a third of him so these are the great powers we wrestle against there's four levels now I want to if you just look up let's turn your Bibles to Colossians chapter 1 let's go to Colossians 1 God created all of these but he did not give them all up or did not let Satan rule over all of them right so Colossians 1:16 this is a very striking thought I hadn't seen this before till yesterday as I was studying cautions 1:16 for by him we're all things created speaking of the Christ the word the word of God the logos for by the logos or the holy spirit were all these things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible okay whether they be Thrones now look Thrones is the highest right because what is the highest dimension the seventh dimension what is in the seventh dimension the throne of God amen I'll tell you the devil will never have control over that way amen that's God's Amen that's that's where the angels of God might go and get here or Michael and wormwood and all the angels of God are there and say when Satan has access there but he'll never rule that amen but see Christ Christ the word the spoken word of God created Thrones dominions now this must be the next level down throne is the greatest one and then dominions or principalities I remember the Bible said that we wrestle against what principalities in Ephesians 6:12 so Satan at least has power over principalities and/or powers and that's also in Ephesians 6:12 principalities powers rulers of darkness world and spiritual wickedness in high places okay all things were created by him and for him so God creates these realms and then in order to express his self amen remember God didn't have to let us fall but God knew he would fall so he could express self as a savior amen glory he knew had him and Eve would fall just like you and I would have felt we were in the garden as well but he wanted to manifest himself as a savior as a healer as a redeemer amen all the great attributes of God but some of these he created that Satan cannot overcome Satan will never overthrow his throne although he tried to her looking at that next he tried to overthrow it but he can never do it and then dominions so I'm not sure I look at that more but as we get in the next few weeks in Lord willing or principalities or powers all things created by him for him so these are the levels God created now let's go to revelation 12 verse 4 let's look at this beginning of spiritual warfare revelation 12:4 now actually let's go to verse 3 because we know this is Satan and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven Crown's upon his heads and we know what the seven heads mean and the ten horns remember the horns were the rulers that are going to be a part of the Roman Catholic Church in the Tribulation Period and the heads seven heads represent the Seven Hills now verse four and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven so Satan's great dragon tail takes a third of the stars of the angels of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born so Satan takes a third of the Angels and then sends them down to earth to try to kill baby Jesus right right now verse 5 and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up to God and to his throne amen there's God thrown ha ha ha they didn't he created that one and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had the place to God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days that's three and a half years that's the Tribulation Period that's the last half of Daniels 70th week it's the last half year or a half week rather okay now verse seven and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and that Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him amen so Satan we see the beginning of spiritual warfare started in heaven I want to give you a few names here so you can kind of understand Satan's characteristics in the Greek here Satan in the Greek means the accuser the accuser that's what his name means Satan so how does God define Satan he accuses people in the Hebrew Satan means opponent or adversary so this is how God named Satan oh he's at my opponent he's my adversary he's the accuser now if you know Lucifer Lucifer actually means a bright star and that's that's why some people translate as Morningstar but Jesus is the bright morning star but it shows that Lucifer was so bright that he was bright like a star he's the bright one so Lucifer was bright and we'll look at that just a moment but I want to go to one more the Bible said when the devil tempted Jesus in the waters the Bible said the name devil means Diablos which means the slanderer slanderer now what a slander it's harming someone's reputation by communicating false statements about them all right so Satan accuses he's an opponent but when he accuses he lies he puts false statements it also means a defaming someone's character so tearing down their character instead of making them have good character Satan destroys their character all right so let's keep those scriptures in mind there so we can understand Satan the Satan but he's like a dragon and he fought against Michael and his angels all right praise God now let's go to Isaiah 14 here Satan does all this damage with his tongue he lies with his tongue he's done all this great damage he's gonna deceive the whole world through his lying tongue he's gonna slander the Lord Jesus Christ slander true Christians he'll speak against them and give them a defame their character there's so important to remember that Satan does all this damage just with his tongue he's a liar now Isaiah 14 just a moment I'm gonna get there to verse 12 I know I haven't preached on this lately I can't remember the last time I did so I want to just bring it out here with Satan we'll look at how the spiritual warfare started why it started it's good for the children I don't know if I've ever preached it to my children or not at our house Isaiah 14:12 Howard thou fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation's see what lying does right see what slandering noses weakens your spiritual state right we can't have confidence with God if we're speaking bad about other people right we're accusing other people falsely or defaming their character and by this he weakens their spiritual state weakens the nation's because remember the Bible said they're gonna be rich and increased with Goods I mean they're gonna keep getting richer and richer so that God's not talking about weaker financially he's talking about weaker spiritually now verse 13 for thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I'll send above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High Amen now look at that my said at five times I will I will five times and so what what is his great attribute here we know Satan always wants to promote himself Satan's object is personal ambition I will do this I'll be a I'll be greater than God I'll be above God this is what he was saying in heaven now at church this is what I believe happened I think you can prove it just by the scripture he went around telling these other angels he was slandering God maybe slandering Michael Wright because he had a war against Michael the only way he could convince him to fight as if he was told him something bad about Michael Wright why else would you want to fight somebody unless you had something against them so he went around robear said and we know he split the church in heaven to Angel Church he took a third of the church he split the church by slandering Michael now I don't understand this yet but Michael's our Archangel but he's got to be higher than the cherubs right because Satan was the anointed cherub that covereth and there's always two cherubs right so there's only one Archangel in the Bible that's Christ that's what I can find I'm sorry that's Michael sorry Michael and then there's two cherubs that covers so I'm not sure how that works out in heaven at the heavenly throne I don't have the revelation on that yet but Satan wanted to be higher than God he said I will be like the Most High his position wasn't high enough he was right there next to the throne of God but it wasn't high enough oh my mercy not help us be content with where God's called us to be praise God so say it is all about personal ambition now don't get this confused with your own calling in life Mike remember brother man talk about Abraham Lincoln how he every Christian should have ambition so see ya it's good to have a mission as long as God's behind it right but not self-promotion where you're trying to put yourself above other people and the when you do that you slander other people that's how we know Abraham Lincoln wasn't a bad guy he never slandered anybody he was just leading following the leading of the Lord to set the natural prisoners free right then 100 years later God set the spiritual prisoners free by the opening of the seventh seal that's right he did so it's self promotion this is the heart of Lucifer this is the heart of the slanderer or the opponent of God I will do this I want my throne to be above gods so now you can see how the first spiritual warfare started one person wanted to be higher than another person so he went around slandering talking bad about that person until it started a war now look at verse 50 15 yea shall that be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon me and consider these saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms now I don't know what's gonna happen he was so bright at the beginning but remember the Bible said he can transform himself into an angel of light as well so he can transform you know the kids watch this little app called Superbook you ever seen it it's a nice Christian kind of story they have Christian stories but you ever children ever notice how Satan can transform himself sometimes he's real bright sometimes he's real dark it looks real evil well when he gets cast out he loses that brightness because he's just they look on him and say is this the man oh yes so he loses all that and he's he's exposed for what he is just a deceiver is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms see what is this shaking you know even America with all the gun violence everything why is that shaking people why is why are people worried about racism and all these things in the nation who's doing that Satan's doing that now right he shakes the nation so he can change the laws to get a more evil right for the one world government amen we're into a one universe government amen amen glory the government of Christ Jesus amen who rules with a rod of iron in the Millennium sea is this the man verse 17 that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoner so see Satan locks people in he changed people in his prisoners right he imprisons them and Sid that's why we got to make sure we're not a slave to any sin we have to make sure if the son of sin is freak we're free indeed we should have leave here chained and imprisoned in our mind or or slave to any sin we should leave free because he said it's free amen Satan's whole desire is to keep people enclosed in houses of prisons amen dori but our desires to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of our lives amen to live in God's house amen not to be a prisoner to Satan so he's all about self ambition self-promotion in church you probably know it though you know the Bible says it every I forget the exact word in Proverbs but every struggle comes from pride for behind every fight behind every contention is pride and this is why because that's how Satan that's how the first war started in heaven was pride he wanted to be higher than somebody else praise God you know the Bible says that the Bible says if you got a gift their God the gift of God will open doors for you the gift in your life will make room for you so you and I don't have to compete I never had to compete you know with brother Brooks oh and he's my pastor I never had to compete to preach God just opened the doors for me I never had to compete to be the other Deacon and trying to persuade people you need to vote for me or you need to do that know if there's a gift in my life that God opens the doors for you right if you've got a gift in your life you want to compete one to slander anybody you don't to be a politician you just got to be a Christian amen because God the gift of God will open doors for you see it's not but same was on the pile dicks trying to sway a third of them now if he's got a third Church if he's got a third right that means there's twice as many angels as as try so many good angels and bad angels right so we're never outnumbered aim head and Bobby on all that we got God behind us amen we got twice as many angels and we got Jesus Christ behind us amen there's nothing to fear for the Christian praise God amen so what does he's a slanderer and since we're here flip over to proverbs real quick proverbs 11 if at all possible church when we hear about you know wrongs amongst our friends and things we should try to keep it quiet as possible there are some exceptions you do have to talk about problems I know that I shared things but I hear you know with people that have left at different times because I want you to know about it and wonder where you wonder where they are and I want you to know the whole story because they could come against me and you know try to turn you against me so alright the Bible said then that's in a rebuke before all so I've got a scriptural ability to do that I don't like to do it but there's some things that you can't keep secret you have to share other things you keep seeker we try to keep him secret now verse 13 robbers 1113 a tail bearer revealeth secrets but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter amen so after remember when we're tempted to tell some secret from somebody it's an unfaithful spirit but we want to have a faithful spirit in other words a true spirit we want to be a faithful friend now verse 9 is actually good as well let's go back up to verse 9 and hypocrite with his mouth destroys his neighbor but through knowledge shall the just be delivered see nice that's a good scripture for Satan how he's a slanderer he destroys someone's character well let me tell you about pastor Jesse he really he's not fit he don't really have a good character he's no good see that's a destroying someone's character but if you just got to talk of a problem will someone hurt my feelings and we're gonna I need to talk to them about that that's different we just don't want to destroy we don't want to accuse falsely and we don't want to destroy anybody and slander anybody's name and good character does that help by God's grace because this is how Satan gained his own church we'd say gain his own army by slandering Michael and of course God Almighty in the throne of God now let's go to Ezekiel 28 this is a good scripture you haven't seen it for a while xico 28:11 because here we see the the minds and thought of Satan and so we can attack with that this week we know who it's from it wasn't God it was the devil we don't want this kind of mind humility church humility we look at that the poor in spirit theirs is the kingdom of heaven humility god help us to always be humble xico 2811 moreover the word lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto Him thus saith the Lord God thou see us up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty so the king of Tyrus is the devil right the Satan because he says thou has been an eID in the garden of God so that that actual the king of tyre the ruler of tires of that type there's no way that was him because there's no way he was in Eden right Satan was cast down to the earth the Bible said out of heaven this can only mean Satan and brother Bram says that there's a quote on that the man said see it had to been Satan cuz he was in Eden the garden of God every precious stone was thy covering so Satan look beautiful imagine every stone being is covering the Sardis the Topaz and the diamond the barrel the onyx and the Jasper and the sapphire and the emerald and the carbuncle and gold how many is that one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten mmm interesting ten after look at my other ten the workmanship of that tablets those are musical instruments and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was greatest he's a musical cherub verse 14 now are the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so now us upon the holy mountain of God thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire I picture that stones of herb there's there's fire there's volcano fires going around and Satan just walking all over and then at creation right this is creation when there's fires upon the earth and all the all the mountains are being formed and there Satan just walking right along there because he was cast down to the earth he was in Eden the garden of God 9 verse 15 thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the myths of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God and I'll destroy the Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire verse 17 mine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of my brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before Kings that they may behold thee that has to follow thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee all they that know the among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a tear and never shalt thou be anymore so that's God Satan's destiny a fire God is gonna start a fire on the inside of him and gonna burn him there then cast him in the lake of fire this is the the scripture so again we see he gets corrupted through his pride he starts loving himself too much he's looks in the mirror and he just he feels he's so handsome you know he's better than Michael he's better than the throne of and that corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness he was so bright Lucifer the bright one right so now we can see that Satan here was and the Bible also said he was king of tyree now during that time tyria was an important major Kingdom it was a great Kingdom this was about 600 years before Christ King tyre was a huge metropolitan a great economic place so who was the king of that Satan was the king of that place that's right so now with that let's go now as we said to Daniel 10 back to here let's see this again so you can see how there's demon principalities over different portions of the earth Daniel chapter 10 right after Ezekiel yeah next book now we're on time to read all this but verse 1 Daniel 10 1 and the 3rd year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed on the Daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had the understanding of the vision in those days I Daniel was mourning 3-4 weeks I had no Pleasant bread neither came flesh or wine in my mouth neither did I know it myself at all until three whole weeks were fulfilled now remember he was fasting and pray now this was a special kind of a fast he ate food which is not the best food so for us it might just be like a vegetarian diet right because he didn't eat the good food drink the wine he said for three weeks I'm just gonna eat the very just simple common food and I'm gonna seek the Lord about how long are my people gonna be in Babylon no but remember now I'm sorry you got taken over I Persian now it's Persia because this is the king of Persia member went Babylon Medes of Persians Greeks and then Babylon I'm sorry and then was it Babla no Rome thank you sorry we're so now they're the second kingdom already they're the Persian Empire Medes and Persians so angel appears unto Daniel he falls down like he's dead verse 10 let's go to verse 10 Daniel 10:10 and behold a hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said to me Oh Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand the right for unto thee am I now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling as you know anytime a person sees an angel the Bible usually they're frightened it's not a fun experience it's a frightening experience because they're all holy priests God they carry the apprentice said the angel of his presence the angels carry the presence of God Almighty now verse 12 then he said to me fear not Daniel for from the first day that now did set thine heart to understand and to chasing thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I'm come for thy words race guys see how important your words are amen that proves he's the high priest of your profession amen I've come for your words your words I believe that's for us too our words make it to heaven we just got to keep praying we got to keep wrestling amen keep wrestling keep believing if Daniels words made the heaven our words make it to heaven amen hallelujah now verse see your words are so important my first 13 but the prince here it is with the Prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one in twenty days 21 days see there's a prince there was a demon Prince that was over the kingdom of Persia and he was keeping out this one angel now isn't this striking I wrote this down yesterday God could have sent the answer on the first day right is God power it was God more powerful than the Prince of Persia yeah what does God do God likes drama all right God like drama he could have won on day number one he could have sent more angels down there keep this guy out but God won the angel to find a little bit amen I wanted Daniel to find a little bit God wanted Daniel to overcome amen God wanted Daniel to know the power of prayer praise God and so God sent the answer on the first day he knew it'd be a 21 day battle but God likes dramas and he wants to see other people be overcomers as well he could have won the first day but he said I'm gonna let you fight for 21 days so you cannot beat you can know what it's like to be a victor see God in other words search God wants us to enjoy the journey right we all be happy in heaven gloria sublime sublime sublime ram says but God wants us to enjoy the battles that's why the Bible said rejoice always and again I say rejoice amen God wants us to enjoy the journey praise God does it ever feel good no you know in our flesh the battles won't feel good to our flesh but God wants us to overcome that and these scriptures prove that God's with us our words go to heaven God's fighting for us he wants us to be fighters he wants us to wrestle on amen he hasn't won us quitters he wants us wrestlers that are overcoming praise God see he could have said it he could have said it on day two he could let the angel fight for two days three seven would have been good that's it on our completion right we all like number seven but he let him fight for 21 days because he wanted them to overcome now let's keep reading here but the prince of the kingdom of persia was to be 120 days but low Michael one of the chief Prince's all that's right this is one of the scriptures that there may be another or maybe st. was the other Archangel it's kind of hard I don't really have an absolute answer on that one of the chief Prince's came to help me and I remain there with the kings of Persia all right so see he had to get help verse 14 now I am come to make the understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days forget the vision is for many days all Daniel wanted to know was God he wanted to confess our sins God Israel's been wicked forgive me and my father all of our sins what is this 70 years mean what's all this when are we going to come back that's all he wanted to know and because he wanted to know the destiny of his people and he was willing to fast for God said tell that Daniel he's greatly beloved in heaven amen but you've got a burden for your people amen but you've got a burden for your family heaven loves to hear your prayers ain't had and then heaven loves you God loves you when you're interceding for other people that's why Daniel so beloved because he kept praying three times a day right and then he would pray for the Israelites he cares so much about his people that he interceded and God said I love you for that amen glory so don't stop praying for your loved ones don't stop keep interceding heaven will love you for that that's right see verse 15 and when he had spoken such words unto me I set my face toward the ground I became not dumb and behold one like the similar tune of the sons of men touched my lips and I opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that sit before me o my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and I've retained no strength like when brother Graham that's the same thing program we loose strength from seeing the visions for how can the servant of this my Lord talk with this my lord fresh for me straightway there remaineth no strength in me neither is their breath left in me then there came again and touched me 1 like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me and said o man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong yeh be strong and when he's spoken unto me I was strengthened and said let my Lord speak for thou has strengthened me a man see he's weak but he says God strengthen me so God sends an angel God sends a man touch that man and he's imparted with the strength of God amen remember Churchill i2a the cake Elisha for 40 days guy said what was in there what nutrients were in there right well the angel put in there but God put something special in there whether it's a cake from an angel or an angel touching you God sends his angels to minister straight to us praise God so he won't be weak we'll be strong amen that's why God sends angels to touch us and feel his presence it'll strengthen us so we can keep fighting the battle amen so we're not weak verse 20 then he said knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee and now I will return to vacation no I'm returning to fight with the Prince of Persia hey so I got a little break to deliver the message now I'm gonna go back and keep fighting so apparently God likes battles that are longer than three weeks praise God with the Prince of Persia and when I have gone forth lo the Prince of Greece you shall come look at this now this is beautiful look what he's telling him because remember it went Babylon needs a Persia what was next Greece see some now he say after when I've gone low the Prince of Grisha will come and fight because remember what happened all the demons that were in the the Greek Kingdom they come and took over the Medes of versions so here the Angels basically prophesied telling him the Greek Empire is coming right the Greek Empire is coming so see there's a king there's a demon power that was over the Greeks and there was a demon power that was over the Persians praise God mine now what brother ham say is over America he said entertainment so a lot of these demons are entertainment right he said there's a entertainments fear especially Hollywood maybe that one's spirit of lust or entertainment or joking brother Graham called it but there's something here about Northeast Ohio with this drug epidemic it's worse here than I think anywhere in the nation have to look that up but it's really awful here now look at verse 21 well I should will show unto thee that which is know in the scripture of truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but Michael your prints look at this God is letting this one angel ride on the Prince of Persia it was the Prince of the Greeks is gonna come - why didn't God just what about us when Paul says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood he wants us to be part is wrestling match amen can I say like that let's not let the angels do all the wrestling amen let's wrestle with them amen that's why we gotta keep remembering these people with cancer and prayer keep wrestling keep wrestling I think we prayed for Kiley rose for two years I think until she finally got the victory with no more tumors I consider yes I believe God help the definitely through the doctors but I believe that was prayer too we eat some of us fasted and miss some meals praying for her it took a while but I believe that's an example of God sparing someone's life I'll be that's an example wrestling against spiritual wickedness in high places I believe that I could be wrong now this one I was thinking about maokai naman Rupp you're playing but I prayed for seven years for a piano player I felt like I was wrestling for seven years Betsey we got one in a wonderful song leader to you by God's grace thank the Lord but that was hard I mean I cried I wept and I wanted I really wanted to do musicians you know that might be small for you that's great that's big to me because I lose all my strength if I do all of it so that's just example wrestling here's another one I mean this one that hasn't go to pass yet but with my dad we've been I was praying for my dad since I was five or six or seven years old and we're still praying for him he's 68 years old that he would overcome depression we're still praying and church some of these things I'm sharing just from my heart because maybe these are things we need we all need to fast about like if you got a you know I'm starting to realize the spirit of depression the Bible is called the spirit of heaviness if you look under the scripture the spirit of depression has a I will name is for heaviness now we know some people can't be delivered that they still love the spear right but if that person really wants to be deliver deep down into it maybe God wants some of us to wrestle with that wrestling prayer now let me let me remind you this that the sister Megan at camp shirt she had the cancer on her leg like we told you about cam said they did a month-long of prayer chain or fasting chain where everybody took a day they just rotated and after that month it dwindled down I don't know how it is now but no news is good news you know but cam said that's what they did they did a fasting chain for sister Megan and then we fasted a couple days in there too I didn't know they're doing a fast and chain or else I would've invited you to do it I didn't know that till I got there and preached for but look at that look at the power break what was it a month long a wrestling match sorry amen see because there's demons the whole time let's just dramatize it the whole time there's a demon a cancer there and it won't move for whatever reason well there was demons wrestling up here keeping the healing away ah but each person would take a day and fast and pray and pretty soon all these prayers would keep going up they'd go up and then God would eventually send the answer down and she got healing amen I don't know how exactly works but finally I said like this an angel of healing broke through amen I know yeah fasting chains see the Bible said we wrestle not against flesh and blood so I believe God has called us to wrestle at some point don't you just to take a day and just instead of eating for those few meals just spend a few minutes praying I rebuke that cancer no that's what we need to pray about think about doing these things I need to rebuke this I rebuke the spirit of depression in the name of Jesus Christ and keep letting it go up because it's a wrestling match it may not come out the first day but we got to keep praying because God is going to come for those words amen if it lines up with God's will God's gonna answer those words that come forth he wants to see the eris come up to him does that help by God's grace so see there's demon principalities that were wrestling against that are over nations and over areas and we're called to pray against them now I don't know I'm getting a book this week and I'm gonna preach on it maybe next week but I told you this a few weeks ago the this nation started through praying and fasting this nation would not be where it is without praying and fasting see that means there was like a demon power over this Great Britain in North America but those those founding fathers fasted and prayed and fasted prayed until the angels of God brought the victory amen I was reading some testimonies where they should not have won many of these mouths like I was listening to a historian talk and he said he said America even before even before they had a Navy defeated the Great Britain's Navy and they and Great Britain actually had a navy we didn't even have it established Navy and when they when eight went when the soldiers brought back the report that we defeated the the Navy all the founding fathers met there they said the reason we won is because we fasted let's fast again so because God was helping a army of nobodies defeat the greatest army the Lord ever seen why because they were praying and fasting they realized we're not resting against Great Britain we're wrestling against demon powers at high places they want to keep us under this Anglican and Catholic dogma amen this nation was founded on prayer and fasting on wrestling with demon powers I'm going to try to finish here so I'm getting a book on that I want to look at it at that this week is just a short book it's called shaping history through praying and fasting I'm getting a book on that because the church that's what Daniel 10 is Daniel 10 is God's shaping the history of Israel through his prayer and fasting God was showing Daniel how is my nation going to be shaped what's the history of Israel gonna be and he only found out through prayer and fasting now what do you think the rapture is going to be just the rapture without pregnant fasting if we were if we were to go to a heavenly nation we're not trying to take over a natural nation we're trying to go to the heavenly nation amen are we gonna get there without prayer and fasting undoubted because jesus said while I'm here they won't fast amen but once I'm gone my disciples will fast amen hallelujah but we know fasting and free and praying that's the hardest that's the least popular preaching usually so we need to get we need to be open to that we didn't let the Holy Spirit guide us into those things because there's three things Jesus said he said make sure you pray give alms and fast he said when you pray go in the closet when you give alms doing secret and when you fast he didn't say if you fast he didn't say if you pray he didn't say if you give alms he said when you do it we've got to do it and see God's leading us he's giving us reminders of that so we can see these things alright let me close here praise God so God sent the answer on the first day but God likes drama and he wanted to see the overcomers battle you want to see Daniel keep praying all right well Lydia can you switch over here go to Daniel chapter Daniel 12:1 I want to play a youtube video in just a moment hopefully the volume works this is a beautiful video about Israel six-day war do you remember that lives from 1948 remember the six-day war we'll look at that in just a moment here let's go to Daniel chapter 12 see Michael is always connected to Israel now he's got some connection I think to the bride as well because he was there or he was the one that Satan argue with and said where is Moses resurrected body he said the Lord rebuke thee so Michael is connected to resurrections as well but he's also connected to Israel and then remember there's a shocked voice Trump the voice is the voice of an archangel so to me seems like well the only arc angel by name in the Bible is Michael that's the only one so it seemed like there's a connection with Michael and I remember the second the second one the voice of the Archangel raises the dead in Christ the shout gets us ready it's the it's the the shot that goes out to get everybody gathered to the rapture the voice of the Archangel raises the dead in Christ and the Trump of God changes our bodies amen those are the three the shout gathers us the voice of the Archangel raises the dead in Christ and the Trump of God the Bible said when the Trump of God sounds were changed in a moment tweak of an eye Amen so the trumpets for our body change but the voice the Archangel is for the dead Saints to rise there's some connection there again with Michael and resurrected bodies or some great connection now Daniel 12 verse 1 and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there should be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered that's Israel every one that shall be found written in the book now Church who always stands up for Israel Michael does that means when that one angel was trying to get the Daniel he's wrestling for 21 days Michael came right there and stood up for he said let's fight buddy you want some of me come on he said hold him off all right angel you go down to talk to Daniel he held him right there come on you want some of this you know he he gave a good fight he stood up for Israel the prayer was borders no some Michael come and a for Israel so that angel could get through and here Michael is gonna stand up for the 144,000 that's what the Bible says here because this is the time of trouble he stands up for thy people Israel now I I'm just I'm just gonna say I'm presuming on this I'm not saying this is absolutely but it looks like God intervened for Israel through Michael on Israel's six-day war did you know that Mike watch this video it's only six minutes long in 1948 Ivan II was Israel surrounded on three sides it only has three sides because one of the sides is the Mediterranean Sea it only has three sides and it was surrounded by by every maokai you know about the six-day war yeah you got a big smile on your face he's excited about this church they were surrounded on all three sides they were outnumbered by twice as many by the number of you'll see on here the number of soldiers they were outnumbered three times the number of tanks and they had sworn we're gonna throw in Israel we're gonna drive them out and a lot of israel's just trying to get out they thought it was gonna be another Holocaust but then all these supernatural things started happening oh because you can't destroy Israel because God's with Israel amen and so I believe it was angels that interacted here so let's play this again is the sound coming through there the flink of annihilation now the Arab nations surrounding Israel vowed to make the blue Mediterranean run red with the blood of Jews who was thinking in terms on the morning of June 5th 1967 or 67 blue one of the first missions against Egyptian airfields in the Sinai the matter of life and death this is going to be destroyed so these three nations that surround them and they were swearing these Palestinians we're gonna drown Israel in the in the Mediterranean we're gonna drown them there and these guys were some of the guys that actually fought in the war sixty-seven on key thing at 48 but 67 sorry people were people are talking about the imminent destruction of the State of Israel off solo in which there will be an enormous number of Kennedy's at least and health people will be killed rabbis in Jerusalem anticipated so many deaths they actually designated all of the public parks Terri's did you hear that the rabbis were so worried about this war we're gonna they said we're gonna change all the parks in the cemeteries so lot of them didn't have faith but God never left them amen even though he's blinded them God never left them the joke in Israel was last ones out turn off the lights but this black humor so people leave in Israel hear that many Israeli genuinely anticipated a catastrophe Israel found itself outnumbered and outgunned on three fronts Egypt to the South Jordan to the east and Syria to the north Egypt Jordan Syria they were surrounded how many times was Israel surrounded and God always came through for it happened again in 67 see these are Bible days we're living in Bible days amen Soviet Union given two billion dollars worth of arms and machinery to those three nations to destroy history go by so many soldiers three times tanks four times as many airplanes before the war Egypt is your main enemy suffered a series of major mistakes in mishaps so right before the war Egypt made a bunch of mistakes and I was gonna list all their mistakes that they made before the war gory miscommunication what they sold so the president has top generals had all this miscommunication somehow they weren't understanding each other Egypt High Command as they could hear even the Israelites could hear their communication and they they knew they were in one Accord so they're listening to them it was all confusion on that side but Israel had all the understanding amen glory yes warnings a mid-level Egyptian intelligence officers of an imminent Israeli air attack so the one thing was also they got warnings but they kind of played off Pearl Harbor they got the warnings but oh nothing's gonna happen where the were Egypt you know but they came Egypt's commander-in-chief up in a mere gathered his High Command for a party and an airbase did you hear that the Egyptian military meant he took all the generals and had a party he took them out of the front lines and had a big party that remind you of Belshazzar having a party on the night before the war starts and so all the generals are off the front lines and here's Israel so the enemy's moving back in Israel's coming in amen God knows how to orchestrate it amen you Church we just got to stand for God amen if God will backup these that are blind and don't even know the blood of Jesus Christ how much will God be with us as well amen but we got to be willing to 5 amen will understand willing to wrestle against all the wicked demon powers they were caught by surprise and we're trying to take to the air in order to join their meanings they couldn't do it two weeks before the war Egypt replace nearly all of its commanders in Sinai with officers unfamiliar with the terrain so Egypt for some reason two weeks before the war they take all the officers that are familiar with the terrain of Israel and Egypt and know how to fight they just replace them with new guys that know nothing about it see God will confuse your enemy amen if he confused Israel's enemy he'll confused your enemy too amen they sent a red alert to Cairo but the decoding officer used the wrong days code and failed to decipher the final information okay you hear that they they detected Israel coming and they sent the co but they set it for the wrong day it's kind of a they put the wrong password in or something like that and then and then the forces never got the warning that Israel's coming sorry so remain the surprise attack amen God kept their attack a surprise amen so he confuses them he keeps them miscommunicating makes them make all these bad moves why because God's protecting his people the battle belongs to the Lord brother hey this morning never came Sara Ziggler who's written in the six-day war believe this series of Egyptian mistakes reveals the work of an unseen hand oh what a lucky coincidence or you can see the divine hand we see this that God arranged all these things that happen the way they did because he wanted me Israeli strike to succeed you wanted us to win you wanted us to regain our holy places to solve the confusion in the Egyptian command just before the war evoked memories of the biblical story of Gideon routing the enemies of Israel instead of annihilation Israel won one of the most decisive victories in military history many Orthodox Jews and Christians believe the Jewish nation had witnessed a miracle reminding them of Gideon Gideon was totally outnumbered but he kept true to God he kept all the commands and then God come and destroyed the Midianites amen same thing happened here they're surrounded on three sides and God come and give him the victory give them favor he totally confused the enemy right remember get in he that's what happened to all they did with it they blew the horn remember that when you preached on that they blew the horns that was one of a men's first services one of the few they blew the horns and they smashed together some vessels and everything and everybody got confused they started killing each other they had me start to kill themselves God always confuses the enemy because God's not the author of confusion in his army amen his army knows exactly what they're doing we're doing the Word of God amen we're keeping the Word of God now like what this guy says it's beautiful notice how long the war was six days of seeing God and intervene on behalf of the Jewish and that was it really was I think so extraordinary is that you had this moment where Arab leaders in lammott leaders were saying we're going to throw Jews into the sea and it looks like a nether Holocaust of imminence and suddenly in six days the Jewish people defended themselves destroyed their enemies a triple girl and recaptured from their land this one for the first time in 2,000 years they rested they tripled their land they tripled their size in six days they triple their size to get all the holy places back they work for six days and they rest on the seven hey man my that was just in 1967 see so I believe Michael was involved here somewhere because they're surrounded by all these countries saying all our parks are becomes a cemetery but somebody stood up for Israel amen somebody stood up for God's people praise God and it fits the perfect type rat worked for six rest on the seventh oh it's beautiful people in the immediate aftermath of the war everyone religious and secular alike recognized that this was from God Detroit that was just so implausible and here everybody was expecting a tremendous defeat yes there's a miracle even Moshe Dayan it was the commander of the Israeli forces and he was a very secular person he went to visit the Western Wall the day after it was liberated and the tradition to put you know like full of wolves to God in the law so he could elude them to God between the crevices of the law and of course as soon as he left to be a newspaper then in their typical the street was no doubt and read it look at this day and it was a line from Psalm that said this is from God it's wonders in our eyes [Music] someone 1823 let's stand by God's grace someone 1823 this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes amen praise God I hope that's an encouragement and the member had also said there they got back places that they hadn't had for 2,000 years 2,000 years see when the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard against that praise God let's have the musicians come here I hope that's an encouragement that's Oh bless my heart when I seen that yesterday I said praise the Lord if God's fighting as the angel standing up for for them and they're blinded we know we got angels standing up for us because we see the Christ we believe in Jesus Christ we're under the blood of God be willing to fight for this area [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we offer these prayers up [Music] [Applause] [Music] like it was like a hundred times the amount to fight not we willing to stand up on court [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] cry to God round about them taste and see the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him or field Lord he sings there's no [Applause] [Music] blessed is the man or woman and trust in him fear the Lord he is saying Amen hallelujah praise [Music] [Music] you are forever in my you see me through the season [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

the valley of the shadow even when I got it let's now [Music] never let go through the calm and through the storm for my god is me my god is made that's a lie [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes I can see the light that is coming on the horn and there will be it there do the shovel but until that day can see a light that is coming on the storm oh no you never let go every high devil old oh never like oh no you never liked [Music] [Music]
