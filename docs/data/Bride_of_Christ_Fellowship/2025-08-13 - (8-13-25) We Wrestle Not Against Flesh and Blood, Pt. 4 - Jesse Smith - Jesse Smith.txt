========================================

and faithful servant, diligent, a good man, a wise man, a fruitful woman, or an overcomer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can everybody see the thought tonight? &gt;&gt; There's no wrestling match God will put you in that you can't overcome. Now church, some of them are serious. Like let's say the loss of a loved one, right? Let's say somebody unexpectedly dies in your life. That's a that's a hard one to overcome because that's what Job got. Remember Job? He lost all of his children. That was a difficult wrestling match. But you know what was harder than that? When he lost all of his children and then he lost all his money and then he lost his good health. That was one of the hardest wrestling matches. But did Job overcome or not, church? Amen. &gt;&gt; He overcame. Hallelujah. And if Job overcame, we can overcome our trials as well. Hallelujah. How many feel like you're going to do better with your wrestling match tonight by God's grace? I do. I can't lose. Brother Chris, we can't lose. The gates of hell cannot prevail against us. It's impossible because the enemy is not strong enough because the God that's in us is greater. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you for the word of God tonight, Lord God. Lord, thank you for these scriptures, Lord God, reminding us, Lord God, that we can live the word of God. We can overcome by the word of God. You're not going to give us a temptation we can't overcome. You're always going to make a way of escape out of the wrestling match. Lord, I've watched I've watched real wrestling matches where a a person might be on their back, but they escape out of it. Hallelujah. Somehow they they they find enough strength or a technique to get out of that. Lord, that's what you've done for us, Lord God. And Lord, as we saw tonight, it's owning our sin gets us out of the out of the grip of Satan. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. May each person own their sin, Lord God. confess it and they'll get the victory. They'll find the way of escape in the wrestling match. Lord, I was moved this week when I heard that preacher say, "Many will have the root of bitterness in the book of Hebrews 12." And Lord, we've seen bitterness, Lord, in our church year after year, time after time. We haven't had to deal with sexual sin necessarily. Maybe people suing each other. We haven't had to do that. But Lord, many people will be overcome with the root of bitterness. Many are defiled that way. Oh God, Lord, may each wrestler here tonight, hallelujah, in the spiritual realm, may they find the way of escape, Lord, from that hold. Oh God, may they not be choked out. Or Lord, maybe it's hopelessness tonight. Maybe it's fear about the future tonight. As we said, maybe it's lustful thoughts, lustful actions, maybe it's financial burdens, discouragement, maybe it's oppression, as brother Ram talked about, a cloud that just kind of hangs over people's human spirit, and it comes in like waves in and out like waves of the sea, bringing discouragement. Oh God, hallelujah. But may each person remember that greater is the word that's in them than their human flesh that's in the world. Hallelujah. Lord, encourage us tonight that we don't have to lose the wrestling match. We were actually made to win every wrestling match. Hallelujah. We don't have to be chunked out and lose the battle, but we can get the victory tonight by owning our sin. Realizing if there's a sin, it's our fault. And we can make it right by the blood of Jesus Christ. And we can be an overcomer once again. Grant it, Lord. Thank you, God, that the gates of hell will not prevail against this word bride. Hallelujah. And there'll be a seat for her to sit by you, Jesus. Oh, God. Hallelujah. Lord, if that's what I'm to be on the day of judgment, just to be a humble little pastor that served God and never quit, and you can raise me up against people that did quit, then that's fine. That's enough for me, Lord God. Or raised my wife and I up when when people made wrong choices regarding their family and made excuses and didn't serve the Lord because of the family size, then God, then just use me for that purpose, Lord God, if that's your will, Lord God. Or maybe it was people that wouldn't serve you in college, but yet you helped me to do it, Lord God. They just made excuses. Well, in college, I was too busy or I had sports or school or I couldn't wear the right clothes because of college and the pressure. But yet, Lord, you gave me grace to do it, Lord God. Not I, but the grace of God that was with me, Lord God. Whatever little testimony, God, you can gain from my life. Help me to wrestle and overcome that I can have a seat at the throne of the Lord Jesus at the white throne judgment. that I'll not be out there among the sheep as a goat, but I'll be seated in judgment with the Lord Jesus. Lord, each one of us desires that tonight. Lord God, may every person here, Lord, win the wrestling match in order to sit by Christ on the throne. Make us overcomers. I pray that we'll take the word of God and overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ. Lord, bring conviction, Lord God, and also bring forgiveness, Lord, when your people repent. Give victory, give joy, Lord God, when people repent, and give them strength to win the wrestling match. May they be strong in the Lord and the power of his might. Hallelujah. And having done all, may they stand back on their feet, ready to fight off Satan in Jesus.
