[26:38] precious nuggets there help me further
[26:40] understand the gospel understand the
[26:42] word understand the mind of God and
[26:45] right it gives me faith to continue on
[26:49] it gives me faith because the word is
[26:54] perfect sorry I'm supposed to grab this
[27:01] I'm not used to one of these I have a
[27:05] lengthy reading here in the beginning if
[27:06] we could and about 26 verses in a row
[27:11] we're going to read this and if it's a
[27:14] simple little subject but I want to
[27:16] teach this by the grace of God you know
[27:18] I'm just a teacher this
[27:20] morning you just rolled out a little
[27:21] spare tire and I can't take you the
[27:23] whole way the Bill Graham said he said
[27:26] the pastor will see you through we can
[27:29] take a teacher and just roll him and put
[27:30] the little spare tire on the side there
[27:32] and he'll get you about 50 60 70 miles
[27:34] by the grace of God and he's a little
[27:37] lighter he's a little bit thinner walled
[27:39] but all is well he he'll work for
[27:41] purpose let's go to Genesis 41 I
[27:46] wandered on this for almost 20 years
[27:48] what this meant and I'm when the Lord
[27:54] opened up to me I was so excited and it
[27:58] shows you the power the mind of God is
[28:02] preeminent see everything is planned out
[28:06] Saints are gone we don't have to worry
[28:09] about anything we have nothing to worry
[28:11] about everything you want every desire
[28:14] just wait on it it's going to happen
[28:16] I am fully believing that my faith is
[28:20] just right there the things with the
[28:23] very things we desire that are in the
[28:25] will of God are ours even though we
[28:28] cannot have it right now or it looks
[28:30] like it's not possible it trust me it's
[28:32] possible let's start here in Genesis 41
[28:36] and we'll start at verse 1 and it came
[28:42] to pass at the end of two or four years
[28:45] that Pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood
[28:48] by the river and behold there come upon
[28:51] the river seven well-favored kine and
[28:53] fat fleshed and they fed in a meadow and
[28:57] behold seven other kind came up after
[29:00] them out of the river ill-favored and
[29:02] lean fleshed and stood by the other kind
[29:06] upon the brink of the river and the
[29:08] ill-favored
[29:09] and the lean kine favoured did eat up
[29:12] the seven well-favored and fat kine so
[29:14] Pharaoh awoke so he had this dream and
[29:17] there's seven here and there's seven
[29:19] there and then pretty much equal doubt
[29:22] it even out and then he woke up he went
[29:25] to bed again here a second time in verse
[29:28] five and he slept and dreamed the second
[29:31] time and behold the seven ears of corn
[29:33] came up upon one
[29:34] stalk rank and good and behold seventh
[29:38] in ears and blasted with the east wind
[29:40] strung up after them
[29:41] I don't know further Jessie had taught
[29:44] this already but I actually shared it
[29:45] with him a little kid did he teach this
[29:48] guy would you ever repeat and behold
[29:52] seventh in years and blasted the east
[29:54] wind sprung up after them and the Seven
[29:56] thin ears devoured the seven rank and
[29:58] four years and verse seven and Pharaoh
[30:01] awoke and behold it was a dream and in
[30:05] this dream saying to God he was trouble
[30:06] to use trouble you to dreams and notice
[30:08] the second dreamer seven and there were
[30:10] seven again okay and he called his
[30:15] magicians and his wise man all together
[30:18] there and he said tell me this dream I
[30:21] want to know it and then I man
[30:25] remembered the truth of the butler there
[30:27] and remembered that there was a man in
[30:29] the prison house a Joseph that I could
[30:31] interpret dreams and the interpretation
[30:34] of his dream had come to pass and he was
[30:36] saved he was restored back to Pharaoh's
[30:38] house so if we could turn to verse 22
[30:45] there and his he was rehearsing this and
[30:53] I saw in my dream and behold seven years
[30:55] came up in one-one stalk full and good
[30:59] and behold seven years with withered
[31:01] thin and blasted with the east wind
[31:03] strung up after them and the thin ears
[31:05] devoured the seven good ears and I told
[31:07] this unto the magicians and there was
[31:09] none that could declare it unto me if we
[31:14] could read together here verse 25 and 26
[31:16] we'll start on the count of three if we
[31:18] could read this together verse 25 and
[31:21] Joseph said unto the Pharaoh the dream
[31:25] of Pharaoh is one he says God has showed
[31:29] Pharaoh what he is about to do verse 26
[31:32] the seven good kine seven years and the
[31:36] seven good ears are seven years he says
[31:40] the dream is one so let's say a word of
[31:44] Prayer I just wanted that to sink in
[31:47] let's bow our heads
[31:49] dearly father Lord Jesus slope we just
[31:51] love you Lord we come Lord just as
[31:53] reverently was we could God Lord
[31:55] standing here Lord and Lord Lord we pray
[31:58] a blessing upon the people Lord the
[32:00] hearing of the word God Lord may you
[32:01] empower them Lord may you strengthen
[32:03] them God Lord Lord may you given them
[32:05] revelation or may awaken them God Lord
[32:07] may awaken us Lord this entire bride
[32:09] awake in a slore - what we have to
[32:12] accomplish in this day in this hour Lord
[32:15] things that we have to fulfill
[32:16] individually but it would be with the
[32:18] congregation or be with our pastor Lord
[32:20] brother Jesse Lord is he's over
[32:22] preaching there in another state about
[32:24] eight hours away Lord drive time and or
[32:26] just anoint him accordingly as well or
[32:28] we just love you so much
[32:29] in the name of Jesus Christ amen and I
[32:31] have your seats saints of God back home
[32:37] there at my home assembly the the Lord
[32:39] has been dishing out some very very
[32:43] wonderful things oh I love brother bangs
[32:45] shirt wow that's beautiful brother amen
[32:48] praise God
[32:50] I like that and one of the things I
[32:53] wanted to say this because this so
[32:55] encouraged there's a couple things that
[32:56] have been preached over the pulpit found
[33:00] an ink they have just have been come
[33:02] they've become a standard in my life one
[33:05] of them was a years ago and and all the
[33:07] services are good all but there's
[33:08] certain things that you know that just
[33:10] gave that were just like it was like
[33:12] almost like a steroid a spiritual
[33:13] steroid pumped into you in your ears and
[33:17] one of them I remember years bag brother
[33:19] Brooks had come and he preached and he
[33:20] said he said these are did you know that
[33:21] you're the god of Satan and when he said
[33:24] that that put such the mindset into me
[33:27] then when I tell spirits what to do if
[33:30] there's something I tell that demon what
[33:32] to do what it would where to go and when
[33:35] to go and I believe by faith that he has
[33:38] to listen to us we have to understand
[33:42] who we are and my pastor here we was
[33:44] preaching and he started preaching on
[33:46] Enoch and if you think about this and I
[33:50] want this to just chew on this is just a
[33:52] little bonus nugget that was given to me
[33:56] and it's really incredible the rapture
[33:58] since then anyone believe they're gonna
[34:00] miss the rapture is it is this rapture
[34:03] gonna be tough to make is is this thing
[34:05] gonna be I mean the Prophet said it's
[34:07] gonna take more faith in this age than
[34:10] any other age we need rapturing faith
[34:14] did you know and did think about this
[34:17] and I'm just gonna say it's one sense
[34:19] thing Enoch made the rapture under the
[34:23] blood of bulls and goats this was before
[34:31] the perfect sacrifice came this was
[34:34] before the infilling of the Holy Ghost
[34:39] he made the rapture before all that and
[34:46] if you have the life of Jesus Christ in
[34:49] you it is a it is done we are just
[34:53] waiting for that time all that faith is
[34:58] already within you it'll come don't
[35:01] worry anymore saints of God right now
[35:04] it's time for you to find and me to find
[35:08] our calling to find our spot in the body
[35:12] what we are supposed to do I am very
[35:16] encouraged you see brother Malachi up
[35:17] here playing piano brother amen and
[35:19] faithful here sister Lydia all of us
[35:21] here sitting here this saints of God
[35:23] what but now we're here now we're here
[35:25] to feed we're here to get something from
[35:28] the word of the Lord and then now our to
[35:30] go out and do something with it it's
[35:33] this simple things of God we've already
[35:35] made this rapture it's gonna happen we
[35:37] have nothing to worry about it Laurel or
[35:40] if you if we have the Spirit in us to
[35:42] the Holy Ghost and if the Holy Ghost is
[35:46] in us do you think the Holy Ghost is
[35:47] worried about this rapture he's not
[35:51] worried about it and if we have the Holy
[35:55] Ghost we should not be worried as well
[35:58] everything is gonna work out for our
[36:01] good amen
[36:04] [Music]
[36:06] anyhow I just wanted to share that by
[36:07] the grace of God if I had a topic this
[36:10] morning I know there was a little bit of
[36:11] reading there and that's all right uh
[36:13] III haven't understood this for almost
[36:15] 20 years I've wandered this evenin
[36:17] denomination I was sitting there I was
[36:19] thinking Oh what does this really mean
[36:20] you know what is the what is the real
[36:22] meaning of this and I think here if I
[36:28] had a topic would be fed in famine fed
[36:31] in famine
[36:33] I think back to Amos in fact let me read
[36:38] I want to share this - I actually got
[36:41] invited to a little fraternity reunion
[36:45] from my high school days when I was a
[36:48] real heathen okay and a sergeant and I
[36:53] went to that Friday night and I seen my
[36:56] old fraternity brothers all the way from
[36:57] New Jersey and many various areas in the
[37:00] state and and it was the same old same
[37:05] old I I probably shouldn't have but I
[37:08] brought my wife and I said now prepare
[37:12] yourself you're gonna hear a lot of
[37:14] things
[37:14] and sure enough she's like wow that was
[37:17] a yeah yeah that's how it is out in the
[37:19] world every other word is a swear word
[37:23] every other thought is continually evil
[37:26] it just goes worse and worse one simple
[37:29] even innocent comment I could make and
[37:31] it went downhill just as fast as falling
[37:35] off of a cliff saints of God I am so
[37:38] grateful to be where we are today I
[37:42] don't know if you remember when you were
[37:44] back and you were lost whether it was in
[37:46] a religious condition or a heathen
[37:48] condition but thanks be to God where we
[37:52] are right now is this our ending know
[37:55] who we're going beyond but we thank the
[37:57] Lord Jesus Christ for bringing us all
[37:58] the way out and into this precious word
[38:06] so now in in Amos 8:11 the Bible says
[38:11] behold the days come he says saith the
[38:16] Lord God that I will send a famine in
[38:19] the
[38:19] and since cottony been been hungry
[38:21] there's been a lot of times where you go
[38:24] on to a fast and you put yourself in a
[38:27] famine on purpose so for to accomplish a
[38:30] certain thing to accomplish a desire in
[38:33] your heart you meet an answer from God
[38:34] there is someone on your that's weighing
[38:37] in the spiritual realm and your on your
[38:40] heart and you need it answered or
[38:41] there's Lord I need to know this and all
[38:44] right I need to know that and we put
[38:46] ourselves in a fast and it's like a
[38:48] little miniature famine no eating your
[38:51] drink water your drink maybe a coffee to
[38:54] give you a little caffeine he says but
[38:57] about that God he says I will send a
[39:00] famine in the land a famine is a tough
[39:03] time there's no food the waters scarce
[39:05] others absolutely nothing to eat people
[39:08] are calling out for food or they're
[39:12] crying and the Bible says it was not a
[39:15] famine for bread it was not a famine or
[39:18] for water is not a famine for the
[39:21] porkbelly it was not a famine for least
[39:24] chicken it was not that kind of famine
[39:26] that God was calling for but he was said
[39:29] he says nor thirst of water he says but
[39:31] it was a famine of what but of the
[39:33] hearing of the words of the Lord saints
[39:36] of God there is a famine for the hearing
[39:39] of the words of God right we know these
[39:43] things that are are taking place and
[39:45] have been taking place when I was in
[39:49] denomination on on the Friday nights we
[39:52] had a pretty strong youth group because
[39:53] mean by the cam were the leaders there
[39:54] and we had we're leaders as far as that
[39:57] kind of that time we were and and we
[40:00] would take the youth over to other
[40:02] churches that had Friday night events or
[40:04] Saturday events and we were just always
[40:06] looking for more words something maybe
[40:08] deeper and the pastor would go
[40:10] year-round would preach the same thing
[40:12] again and again the same year and be
[40:14] family money and this or that to love
[40:16] and Jesus loves you in August but I felt
[40:19] like there is always something greater
[40:21] and and I was oh I was in a famine at
[40:24] that time since I was at the famine
[40:25] there he says and the Bible says and
[40:27] when they wander from sea to sea and
[40:29] notice where they're wandering from in
[40:31] this famine
[40:33] from the north which is what dan which
[40:35] is which is the eagle in the eagle day
[40:38] from the north even to the east they
[40:40] would go from what and a try and enter
[40:43] in at the east gate looking for that
[40:45] food there was a famine the land he says
[40:47] and they shall run to and fro to seek
[40:50] the word Lord and shall not find it in
[40:52] that day shall the fair virgins and
[40:54] young men faint for thirst correct amen
[40:57] now so we know that there is a famine in
[41:00] the land there always has been a famine
[41:03] for a very long time and I'll say like
[41:05] this there's been a famine for 2,000
[41:07] years okay if you think about it okay
[41:09] put your spiritual thinking caps on
[41:11] because I want to show this to you by
[41:13] the grace of God now if we look at these
[41:16] there's actually two sets of people in
[41:18] Amos 8 there is a people in famine
[41:20] there's a people who who is looking for
[41:22] the very voice of God for the catch the
[41:24] very mind of God if you read in the Old
[41:26] Testament there's a a wise man by the
[41:28] name of if a fowl and the Bible says
[41:30] that when he spake he spake as the
[41:33] Oracle of God that there was a man that
[41:36] had such a gift of wisdom that when he
[41:38] spake
[41:39] you were actually hearing from the
[41:41] throne then what he says was exactly
[41:43] what you should do absolutely now
[41:46] obviously fell and turned away but in
[41:49] Amos 8 there is a people in looking for
[41:51] the word of God but then we find here in
[41:53] Malachi 4 and verse 1 and behold the day
[41:58] cometh that shall burn as an oven we
[42:00] know this is our day notice all review
[42:02] and a re ordered many times and all the
[42:05] proud yea and all that do wickedly shall
[42:07] be stubble and the day that cometh shall
[42:10] burn them up saith the Lord of a host
[42:12] and it shall leave them neither root nor
[42:14] branch notice there is a dry time there
[42:17] is a what a scorching time coming but
[42:20] unto you that fear the name shall the
[42:23] son shall fear my name shall the son
[42:25] that s you want of righteous arise with
[42:27] healing as winds and ye shall grow go
[42:29] forth and grow up as calves of the stall
[42:32] notice they are being fed absolutely
[42:35] they're growing the only way you can
[42:37] spiritually grow is to be fed
[42:39] spiritually absolutely and we're not
[42:42] just talking milk but we're talking meat
[42:44] we're talking what the Eagle anointing
[42:46] we're talking about the deep things of
[42:48] God we're talking about the simple
[42:50] things of God we need on everything we
[42:53] need to get these eagle wings strong and
[42:55] these feathers just right we need those
[42:58] kind of things a man right absolutely so
[43:00] the people who are in famine and there
[43:02] are people who were growing up what in
[43:04] God's barn a man praise be to God being
[43:07] fed just like how he would a man now
[43:10] let's continue on by the grace of God I
[43:12] don't want to keep you too long on this
[43:15] I know we have two services in job five
[43:18] the Bible talks about in Joe 5:19 he
[43:22] says he shall deliver yet thee in six
[43:25] troubles yay and seven that shall there
[43:27] no evil touch thee right
[43:29] he says inin famine he shall redeem thee
[43:32] from death absolutely so if there is a
[43:35] true saint of God here which we believe
[43:37] we all are you'll not look like as we
[43:39] have we hate to say this but over in
[43:42] Africa they show you the pictures
[43:43] they're the little little babies and
[43:45] their bellies are bulging and and and
[43:47] and they're all the Flies are all over
[43:48] their eyes God have mercy may God bless
[43:51] them and keep them however send them
[43:53] however who anoints someone to go and
[43:55] touch them people amen
[43:57] may God be with him and here but in a
[44:01] time of famine a time of death he says
[44:03] that God would redeem them from that and
[44:05] in war and from power of the sword
[44:07] correct I think about even the the
[44:11] crisis that has hit American America in
[44:13] in the the hills of Kentucky and
[44:15] Tennessee how they're they're just so
[44:18] malnutrition nutrition and how they that
[44:21] the children who grow up just on
[44:23] mountain Dew and they lose all their
[44:24] teeth and just the gall ragged
[44:27] god-a-mercy it's everywhere Saints and
[44:31] verse 22 at destruction and famine thou
[44:35] shout laugh the Bible says neither shalt
[44:38] thou be afraid of the beasts of the
[44:40] earth they men so here we see that a
[44:43] time of famine God is going to be with
[44:45] you if you're hungry saints of God is
[44:48] spiritually what do you do you eat from
[44:51] this saints of God if you're hungry
[44:54] spiritually what do you do you eat from
[44:56] the very manna from this day you listen
[44:58] to it right
[44:59] you maybe grab a little book and on a
[45:01] certain topic the Prophet preached and
[45:03] you read it and what you're being fed
[45:04] spiritually know it on the face of the
[45:07] earth can do that except they'd be in
[45:09] this message they're starving are they
[45:11] still alive sure many are still alive
[45:14] but they're starving they're starving
[45:16] they're trying to figure it out what
[45:18] gives you strength just reading this or
[45:20] having an understanding of it if you
[45:23] really I think the God knows
[45:24] denomination I read this and I just
[45:26] would not have a clue what this stuff is
[45:29] like Wow it would go in and I forget it
[45:31] in two seconds and I still would have
[45:33] not but now as we read it God over the
[45:36] greater and greater and greater things
[45:38] for you to hear and to understand amen
[45:41] saints of God this rapture is joy that's
[45:49] all it is as you'll see here today by
[45:51] the grace of God will show you
[45:52] understanding of these two sevens by the
[45:55] grace of God what this all meant it's
[45:56] just a simple unfolding it's just a
[45:59] simple revelation it's on is but if you
[46:01] take these things that you have a
[46:02] greater faith in God you have a greater
[46:05] faith in Jesus Christ than ever before
[46:07] hey man now the school here continued on
[46:10] here in uh he says in a time of famine
[46:14] the Bible says in job 5 he says he will
[46:16] redeem you from death he'll keep you
[46:18] from anything that can harm you and how
[46:20] it says here in verse 25 thou shalt know
[46:23] also that thy seed shall be great he
[46:26] says and nine offspring as this grass of
[46:28] the earth thou shall come to the grave
[46:30] in a full age look at that full strength
[46:33] amen you're holding mature he says like
[46:36] a shock of corn cometh in his season
[46:39] absolutely ripe for the harvest we know
[46:43] we're not going to see death in this age
[46:45] but we will be taking up Amon in that
[46:47] area praise be to God there was a
[46:49] brother uh brother mike.mccluskey he was

[47:27] upon them that hope and his mercy to
[47:28] deliver their soul from death and they
[47:30] keep them alive in famine the Bible says
[47:34] God knows when famines coming and he
[47:37] knows how to sustain you during famine
[47:40] amen he says also here in proverbs 10
[47:44] verse 2 through 4 we'll just read verse
[47:46] 3 he says the Lord will not suffer the
[47:49] soul of the righteous to famine you're
[47:53] not gonna starve out Saints Saints of
[47:55] God well brothers we've been eating the
[47:56] same sermons for 50 years saints of God
[47:58] every time I listen to them I get
[48:01] something fresh he keeps showing me
[48:04] things in fact the study is off of a
[48:06] sermon I was listened to on a Saturday
[48:07] my boss made me work and I actually
[48:10] volunteered to work to keep up with a
[48:11] certain job we couldn't be on it and I
[48:13] listened to a certain sermon and this
[48:14] this little phrase jumped out and opened
[48:17] up the entire thing oh my goodness it's
[48:19] amazing
[48:20] it's there just keep listening wait the
[48:23] Bible says to meditate on the Lord think
[48:25] on these things and if you hit that
[48:27] channel it'll open up absolutely the
[48:30] Lord will not suffer the soul of the
[48:32] righteous to famine amen in in a Psalms
[48:35] 34 verse 8 o taste and see that the Lord
[48:39] is good Amen how many here has tasted
[48:41] that the Lord is good thank you God if
[48:43] you ever get in that presence you ever
[48:46] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost

[48:51] alive amen there's no one there's
[48:54] nothing like it praise be to God and I

[49:10] there's no one to them that fear him the
[49:12] Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger
[49:14] but they that seek the Lord shall not
[49:17] want any good thing amen
[49:20] praise be to God look at how many
[49:23] promises are in the scripture Saints God
[49:25] what brother these are just basic
[49:26] scriptures these are promises if you're
[49:29] hungry you can take any one of these and
[49:31] say Lord this is for me and he will feed
[49:34] you any man yeah that's absolutely truth
[49:38] in fact I was actually thinking about
[49:39] stepping down and quit preaching or
[49:43] teaching however four-season just to see
[49:45] if I was in the hand of the will of God
[49:47] and your pastor came in preached number
[49:49] of totally the way he did it rebuked me
[49:52] and then I started preaching that or
[49:53] started studying the next day and he he
[49:55] open these up next to these next two
[49:56] studies here this morning and tonight's
[49:59] so I take it as that he wants me to keep
[50:01] doing Bible studies so we're gonna keep
[50:04] going as saints of God if God says a
[50:08] famine there's always a reason for it he
[50:13] just thought there's families just don't
[50:14] strike because of nothing there's always
[50:16] a reason in Ruth one the Bible says now
[50:21] it came to pass in the days that the
[50:23] judges ruled there was a famine in the
[50:25] land the Bible does not declare what
[50:28] caused that famine but I believe there
[50:30] was something that caused it right
[50:31] weather was a test to test Naomi and to
[50:35] see what would take place or however
[50:36] there was it was a famine sent for a
[50:39] reason amen and if you read the
[50:42] scriptures and this is where we're going
[50:43] to go into tonight and second samuel 21
[50:46] verse 1 saints of god we're going to
[50:48] break this down by the grace of god and
[50:50] show you the importance of this the
[50:53] bible says in 2nd samuel 21 1 then there
[50:58] was a famine in the days of David three
[51:00] years notice of famine strikes the man
[51:04] who's who's had a heart just like God's
[51:06] own heart a man that worshipped God like
[51:09] God wanted to be worshipped a man that
[51:11] loved God like God wants to be loved he
[51:13] says and there's a famine Atlanta Davis
[51:15] year after year and David inquired of
[51:17] the Lord he said why is this taking
[51:19] place the David could look back and say
[51:21] man why is this Florida you I have done
[51:23] this and I have done this and I have not
[51:25] I served you with my heart and this and
[51:27] asked and the Lord now what did he do
[51:28] what should we always do if you think
[51:30] you're in a famine if you're a dry place
[51:31] this morning if you haven't felt the
[51:34] presence of the Holy Ghost long time why
[51:36] don't you inquire of the Lord
[51:44] the brother or sister Lord Lord show me
[51:49] what's going on a man who would do it a
[51:52] man he's faithful and he David Enquirer
[51:56] the Lord and the Lord said it is for saw
[51:59] and for his bloody house because she is
[52:02] slew that give you nice and tonight
[52:05] we're going to touch on the Gibeonites
[52:07] the Lord has opened up what that is and
[52:10] I want to share because to me it is
[52:12] powerful I die the Lord has been keeping
[52:16] me on a certain topic for about five
[52:17] years and I don't go looking for this
[52:20] stuff he just shows it to me it's so
[52:23] what's he said tonight so this famine
[52:27] hit because of the slaying of the
[52:30] Gibeonites okay and also now here in in
[52:34] in this in second Samuel 24 verse 1
[52:36] there is another a situation that takes
[52:39] place the Bible says that that if you
[52:42] read and chronicles that Satan
[52:44] encouraged David to number the people
[52:46] right and we know according to the
[52:49] scripture you are not to number the
[52:50] people which they didn't we don't wanna
[52:51] get overconfident you don't have think
[52:53] you're too big and do this and are we
[52:55] only well we got 200,000 men we only
[52:57] need to some 100,000 God mercy where
[52:59] we're in Owenton we got the we got the
[53:01] Ark of the Covenant with us we got who
[53:03] God was us with the Holy Spirit is with
[53:04] us and we were more than overconfident
[53:06] oh we want to be right on the word amen
[53:08] he says and the Bible said that jate
[53:11] that David said told Joab eases go
[53:13] number the people he said go didn't get
[53:16] all the numbers I want to know because
[53:18] we're going to war however and Joanna
[53:20] for the first time actually does
[53:22] something good he says he says David
[53:23] let's not do this but the Bible says
[53:25] that David's a word prevailed over Joab
[53:27] okay and and as soon as Joab and went
[53:31] and numbered all the people the Bible
[53:35] says that though that David's heart was
[53:37] smote after him that he numbered the
[53:39] people right and then of course the man
[53:42] the Prophet GAD come up to David in
[53:44] verse 11 for when David was up in the
[53:48] morning the world Lord came unto the
[53:49] Prophet GAD David's ear
[53:52] go and say it to david thus saith the
[53:54] lord i will offer the three these three
[53:57] things choose one of them that I may do
[54:00] unto these so David numbers of people
[54:02] it's against the word it's against the
[54:04] scripture is actually the Antichrist
[54:06] spirit doing this correct and notice one
[54:09] of the punishments one of these could
[54:11] have been done look in verse 13
[54:13] so dad came to Dave and told him he says
[54:16] shall seven years of famine come unto
[54:18] thee in the land see so even for one
[54:22] little thing disobedience famine can
[54:24] strike in the land for seven years oh my
[54:27] powerful I think God gave him three
[54:31] options and the second option he says or
[54:33] will they flee three months before thine
[54:36] enemies while they pursue thee and then
[54:39] another option is or that ye be there
[54:42] three days pestilence in thy land and of
[54:45] course David now has to make a choice do
[54:47] we take seven years of famine but
[54:49] remember he knew the scripture they did
[54:51] not have seven years stored up and also
[54:56] he said the three months of fleeing the
[54:58] enemies now look what he comes to he
[55:01] says in verse 14 David said again I am
[55:04] in a great straight let us now fall into
[55:06] the hand of the Lord that is the most
[55:09] best thing you can fall into as a hand
[55:12] of law Lord whether it be for good or
[55:13] for evil for chastisement for spankings
[55:16] or whatever I'd rather be in his hand
[55:18] than in the other hand a man yes law he
[55:22] says four waters mercies are great and
[55:24] let me not fall into the hands of man
[55:26] and of course Israel suffered for this
[55:29] but it could have been a famine could be
[55:30] even worse how many people would have
[55:32] died in a seven-year famine with
[55:34] absolutely nothing stored up
[55:36] oh my praise be to God now we want to
[55:41] move into this we are almost twenty-five
[55:44] minutes in here we're gonna we're gonna
[55:45] keep moving here by the grace of God
[55:47] let's see here
[55:49] another famine takes place in the days
[55:52] of let's see here in the
[55:57] the days of a hab in first Kings 1630
[56:02] through I believe 33 and Ahab the son of
[56:07] Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord
[56:09] at once he became above all that were
[56:11] before him he became a king and it came
[56:13] to pass that he had as if it had been a
[56:15] light thing for him to walk in the sins
[56:17] of jeroboam the son of nebat
[56:18] that he took to wife Jezebel the
[56:21] daughter of eath Bell were king of the
[56:24] zidonians and went and served bail and
[56:26] worshiped him saints of God the prophet
[56:29] Elijah said he said neither do no rain
[56:32] shall strike until I call for why did
[56:35] that happen because of this because of
[56:40] the king had gotten off of the word at
[56:45] the end of the famine when God is going
[56:47] to send a rain now notice here in first
[56:50] Kings 18 and 1 and it came to pass after
[56:53] many days that the word Lord came to
[56:54] Elijah in the third year saying go shew
[56:57] thyself in the Ahab and I will send rain
[56:59] upon the earth and Elijah went to show
[57:02] himself in the air and there was a sore
[57:03] famine in the land what it's already
[57:05] been three years now look what the
[57:07] Prophet says in verse 17 it came to pass
[57:10] when Ahab saw Elijah and Elisha said
[57:14] there art thou he that troubleth
[57:16] Israel so here am puts all the blame on
[57:19] Elijah and he said I have not troubled
[57:23] Israel he said but thou and thy father's
[57:24] house and that you have committed
[57:26] forsaken the commandments of Lord and
[57:28] thou has followed Balaam see were the
[57:30] cause that entire famine was was getting
[57:32] a false king a king that did not love
[57:35] the Lord God and what God smaller with a
[57:37] famine Amen a powerful example of God's
[57:41] power is anger against not Nicollet ISM
[57:44] but Balaam ISM hey man sure now
[57:47] therefore and then we had the showdown
[57:49] correct now that's another famine that
[57:53] hit the land but remember in the time of
[57:57] famine what's the most important thing
[57:59] it is the food it is the seed it is the
[58:04] word of God spiritually right and the
[58:06] natural it's what the corn wheat they
[58:08] made all the brand
[58:09] those things bread was the staple of
[58:11] life back in those days right now look
[58:15] what he says here in masterpiece 64 705
[58:18] he says no it'll never be it at harvest
[58:21] time the seed is back to its original
[58:23] condition and you must have all the word
[58:27] in order to be the seed now there was a
[58:34] there's a quote they hit that that just
[58:37] really just opened us up to me saints of
[58:39] God Jesus said the things that I do you
[58:41] shall do also right and greater things
[58:46] let me ask you a question
[58:48] if Jesus Christ is the original seed
[58:52] what was Luther what was Wesley what was
[58:59] what was all those seven Church Ages was
[59:01] that Jesus Christ let me show you what
[59:05] the Prophet said on this but I'm gonna
[59:08] read us a couple scriptures here in John
[59:11] 6:63
[59:12] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[59:15] flesh profiteth absolutely nothing
[59:19] that's not a revelation that's
[59:21] simplicity he says the words that I
[59:24] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[59:26] are life see so if he's the word the
[59:29] Word was made flesh right the word the
[59:32] logos became flesh God became flesh he
[59:35] was the word he was the seed if Jesus
[59:38] Christ of that seed and he's the word my
[59:41] now in genesis 3:15 and i'll put any
[59:44] between thee and the woman between thy
[59:46] seed and her seed
[59:49] what was that seed that seed was Jesus
[59:53] Christ that's what that prophecy is
[59:55] about the seed was Jesus Christ he is
[59:59] the original seed now in Genesis 12
[1:00:03] verse 6 and Abraham passed through the
[1:00:06] land unto the place of saitama to land
[1:00:09] Omori and the Canaanite was in the land
[1:00:11] and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and
[1:00:14] said unto thy seed will I give this land
[1:00:18] who is thy seed the
[1:00:23] I said it was Jesus Christ we're always
[1:00:27] looking for that seed remember the
[1:00:29] Prophet dramatized it when Jesus Christ
[1:00:32] died for our sins and he went down into
[1:00:34] the hell there and and he started
[1:00:36] knocking on Hell's door or Satan's door
[1:00:39] there and Satan open the door said there
[1:00:41] you are I thought I had you I thought I
[1:00:43] had that seed when I killed Abel when I
[1:00:46] killed the prophets when I killed
[1:00:48] Jeremiah and and and Daniel and all
[1:00:50] these men I thought I had you he said
[1:00:52] but now I've got the real see Toma this
[1:00:55] is the one the prophesied would take me
[1:00:57] down and Jesus said I have taken you
[1:01:00] down amen what my beliefs is my blood is
[1:01:02] still fresh on Calvary it's just
[1:01:04] thinking down soaking your sanctifying
[1:01:06] and it's ready now to fill the people
[1:01:09] with the Holy Ghost a man that's right
[1:01:11] Jehovah Jireh 61 209 he says now notice
[1:01:14] to Abraham at the seat after me and now
[1:01:16] to his not to his but the seed after him
[1:01:19] Abraham many sons but the prowess one
[1:01:22] was through Isaac and through Isaac came
[1:01:24] Christ the Royal seed the real seed of
[1:01:28] Abraham was Jesus Christ they might
[1:01:30] praise be to God sure now I know I'm
[1:01:34] taking a long way here now in Galatians
[1:01:36] 3 and verse 16 he says now to Abraham
[1:01:39] Abraham and his seed he says were the
[1:01:44] promises made he says not to see the
[1:01:46] many but of one and to thy seed which is
[1:01:49] Christ amen okay first John he says
[1:01:59] whoever says born whoever's whosoever is
[1:02:01] born of God does not commit sin for his
[1:02:04] seed remaineth in him
[1:02:08] what is that is that your gene seed no
[1:02:11] it says you're his for his seed
[1:02:14] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[1:02:16] because he is born of God that sees that
[1:02:18] remains in you is the baptism of the
[1:02:20] Holy Spirit it is the law very alive
[1:02:23] very person of God living and dwelling
[1:02:25] in you and that is the seed that keeps
[1:02:29] you clean hey man that's right now
[1:02:35] here he is in question the answer is 59
[1:02:38] 12:23 listened let me read this again
[1:02:41] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[1:02:43] sin for the seed what is the seed of God
[1:02:45] no the prof is breaking this down I just
[1:02:47] reiterate it
[1:02:48] he says the promise Abraham had that
[1:02:50] this - the seed - the seed what does the
[1:02:52] see now Christ is Christ the seen of God
[1:02:55] who's seen is he if he isn't alright
[1:02:59] he's the seed of God Jesus Christ is the
[1:03:02] Holy Ghost right now just when the
[1:03:05] reader at they reiterate that by the
[1:03:06] grace of God now dealing with the seed
[1:03:11] one of the greatest revelations you can
[1:03:13] have if you go to Isaiah 41 for the
[1:03:18] Bible says who has wrought and done it
[1:03:20] calling the generations from the
[1:03:22] beginning he says I the Lord the first
[1:03:25] and the last the first and the last
[1:03:30] notice this is a Hebrew the first and
[1:03:33] the last if you look at Isaiah 44 verse
[1:03:37] 6 he says thus saith the Lord God the
[1:03:39] king of israel and his redeemer the lord
[1:03:41] of hosts he says i am the first he says
[1:03:43] and I'm the last and besides me there is
[1:03:45] no God he said I'm the first and the
[1:03:49] last and as they have 48 verse 12
[1:03:51] hearken to me oh he Jacob in Israel by
[1:03:54] my called I am he I am the first and
[1:03:57] also am the last day man that's just sum
[1:04:01] it up now brother side what are you
[1:04:03] trying to say here he's the first and
[1:04:07] the last in the old in revelations 1 and
[1:04:14] 9 John is now penning the book and he's
[1:04:18] saying and he heard a voice in verse 10
[1:04:22] I was in the spirit of Lord's Day and
[1:04:23] behind me I heard a great voice as of a
[1:04:26] trumpet right in the spirits and Lord
[1:04:30] and what does he say the prophet breaks
[1:04:33] it down here says he says now we hear it
[1:04:36] now what what was he doing he was
[1:04:39] transferred from the I love now
[1:04:40] alabama's now in the spirit over into
[1:04:43] the Lord's Day and as soon as he got
[1:04:45] over the Lord's Day he heard a trumpet
[1:04:47] what was it it's somebody a
[1:04:49] approaching a great ones approaching
[1:04:53] trumpet sound somebody's coming he
[1:04:56] looked he says hallelujah a trumpet and
[1:04:58] what did the trumpet say he says I am
[1:05:01] Alpha and Omega now notice the Jehovah
[1:05:06] of the old he says I am the first he
[1:05:09] says and I am the last and then now we
[1:05:12] get to Jesus Christ of the new and the
[1:05:15] Bible says he's he declared that I am
[1:05:17] the Alpha and the Omega in the same a
[1:05:21] man
[1:05:21] man this fires me up and of course he
[1:05:24] says in 60s 12:04 that happens vision he
[1:05:27] says the greatest of all the revelations
[1:05:30] is the deity the supreme deity of our
[1:05:32] Lord Jesus Christ you can't get to first
[1:05:35] base until you believe that even see
[1:05:38] that's where the promise said you can
[1:05:39] never be eternity and get to revelations
[1:05:42] chapter 1 because here he declared in
[1:05:45] the Old Testament first last but in the
[1:05:47] new he says I am the Alpha and the Omega
[1:05:50] the very exact same worldly man he's one
[1:05:54] of the same did you know this revelation
[1:05:58] of the Prophet is bringing came by a
[1:06:00] supernatural vindication yes I want to
[1:06:04] read this to you
[1:06:06] the prophet went out he had just just
[1:06:09] was a couple of months maybe a year
[1:06:10] before he went out hunting and those
[1:06:12] squirrels right and the squirrels he
[1:06:14] spoke to squirrels and he took his limit
[1:06:17] and this time he goes back out then I
[1:06:20] turned and I started along a familiar
[1:06:23] pathway now this is this is him this is
[1:06:26] God he's bringing him into the church
[1:06:29] ages he's and what was at the church
[1:06:32] ages was the seals this revelation had
[1:06:34] to come before the church ages and the
[1:06:38] seals then I turn and start along a
[1:06:41] familiar little pathway by the side of a
[1:06:43] pasture that crossed over an l-shape in
[1:06:46] the woods and something strange took
[1:06:48] place he's breaking this down all my
[1:06:52] experiences I've never had anything like
[1:06:54] it I looked at the top of the hill to
[1:06:58] the left from where I was standing and
[1:06:59] there come up the top they came three
[1:07:01] rain
[1:07:03] three rainbows appeared to him and
[1:07:06] they're running some 34 - hi first I
[1:07:09] looked and seen the light I turned back
[1:07:11] because I thought it may be the Sun
[1:07:13] arising it was nighttime it's early
[1:07:16] early morning and there was three
[1:07:18] rainbows now remember God is trying to
[1:07:20] teach his prophets something before that
[1:07:22] he goes into this into the church ages
[1:07:26] he says and the second thought I was
[1:07:28] look to the sons and it was towards the
[1:07:30] south it was easy
[1:07:32] another thing it was smooth cloudy rain
[1:07:35] raining all over that was August 25th
[1:07:38] last Friday morning you know how it was
[1:07:40] raining and it's smooth clouds
[1:07:42] everywhere he says and I looked again
[1:07:46] and they were growing taller and taller
[1:07:48] three rainbows I took off my hat I set
[1:07:51] down my gun I started walking towards it
[1:07:53] with my hands up something just said
[1:07:56] that's close enough
[1:07:58] let me tell you something God he has
[1:08:01] certain rules we must abide to we have
[1:08:06] certain parameters we are mortals your
[1:08:08] sons of gods stuck in mortal flesh we
[1:08:11] are talking about a seriously holy God
[1:08:15] after this story I'll tell you another
[1:08:17] Jesus he says and I was close that's
[1:08:20] that that is close enough I was just
[1:08:22] going to sit down and take my boots off
[1:08:24] that I head on to see if I could walk a
[1:08:26] little closer but I got within a few
[1:08:28] yards of it I seen the color it's like a
[1:08:30] fog moving around I stood there for a
[1:08:32] few moments I was coming right to the
[1:08:34] top of the little mountain I watched as
[1:08:36] the three one went right one went left
[1:08:39] and one down the center running down
[1:08:41] into a little Bowl like all these three
[1:08:43] rainbows growing taller coming into this
[1:08:45] bowl he says whatever it was was alive
[1:08:49] he said it was moving and making its
[1:08:52] motions and I just stood there like it
[1:08:54] was graying dawn amen I turned and look
[1:08:58] and I screamed out o God what would you
[1:09:01] have your servant to know God brought
[1:09:05] the supernatural thing three rainbows
[1:09:07] into one pot right before the church
[1:09:10] changes and what does the voice say just
[1:09:15] then
[1:09:15] spear Lord came in and said Jesus of the
[1:09:18] New Testament is Jehovah of the old he
[1:09:24] only changes Mass from spirit to man and
[1:09:27] the Prophet said this is the greatest
[1:09:30] revelation you can have because outside
[1:09:33] of this is confusion and Satan is the
[1:09:36] author of confusion we must know that
[1:09:39] when we see an invisibility that that
[1:09:41] could be God we see a pillar fire that
[1:09:43] can be gone a pillar of cloud that could
[1:09:45] be God if we see Jesus Christ in the
[1:09:47] flesh that's God it's one in the same
[1:09:49] person amen and when I see you brother
[1:09:52] that should be Jesus Christ in the flesh
[1:09:53] as well Haman and the husband and wife
[1:09:55] are one praise be to God now in Isaiah
[1:10:06] Chris last four slash four slash in
[1:10:08] Revelations revelation 1:8 I am Alpha
[1:10:11] and Omega the beginning and the end he
[1:10:14] declares he's Alpha Omega Alpha Omega
[1:10:16] this is in Greek in history the word
[1:10:25] Alpha was used to proclaim the chiefest
[1:10:29] persons or things there were two places
[1:10:35] and they called them Mac mass and meskan
[1:10:41] chai he says and they were called alpha
[1:10:44] for fine flour so at these two places
[1:10:47] their names were tied into alpha which
[1:10:50] meant the fitnah fine flour and there
[1:10:54] was one chief place taquoia
[1:10:56] which meant alpha for oil were the best
[1:10:59] place I can find for oil the best most
[1:11:01] purest most annoyed oil they could find
[1:11:03] and they called it alpha for the oil so
[1:11:08] what is so important about the Alpha the
[1:11:10] Omega in psychology the Alpha
[1:11:17] personality is a leadership personality
[1:11:20] when Jesus Christ came on the flesh he
[1:11:23] was leading the charge he said I am The
[1:11:26] Good Shepherd
[1:11:28] I am the first one in the last I'm the
[1:11:32] one they came he says I come again alpha
[1:11:36] personality is a leadership personality
[1:11:38] to lead something you need to be the
[1:11:40] best at it
[1:11:41] this means the alpha females tend to be
[1:11:44] extremely competitive alpha male
[1:11:46] personal personalities are likely to
[1:11:49] cause a stir in the room just by their
[1:11:51] mere presence or entry and every time
[1:11:54] Jesus Christ took place or set the foot
[1:11:56] in somewhere something took place people
[1:11:59] took notice something supernatural
[1:12:01] always happen why because he was the
[1:12:03] Alpha well it's because their impeccable
[1:12:08] dress or firm handshake or their
[1:12:10] effortless body language alpha males
[1:12:13] tend to naturally command respect and
[1:12:15] attention that's our that's our
[1:12:17] commander that's our leader Jesus Christ
[1:12:19] amen
[1:12:20] now what is the Omega personality alphas
[1:12:26] number one I'm the best this this I will
[1:12:28] lead on this this but what is the Alpha
[1:12:30] personality and Omega personality is one
[1:12:35] defined outside the traditional
[1:12:37] hierarchy of dominance they have the
[1:12:41] intention to neither climb to the top
[1:12:43] nor give way nor give way to others to
[1:12:46] rise above them they simply reveal
[1:12:49] themselves outside of this biological
[1:12:52] system there is no one better you think
[1:12:56] of something
[1:12:56] now you're not the elf of mentality is
[1:13:00] that I am God there is no ideal for the
[1:13:04] America the first and the last the
[1:13:05] beginning in the end that was which
[1:13:07] isn't is to come him and he's all in
[1:13:09] everything about praise be to God now
[1:13:13] I'll read I want to read this quote if
[1:13:17] Jesus Christ is the Alpha and the Omega
[1:13:20] what was loser well reason we're we
[1:13:23] seeing Jesus Christ and Luther in Wesley
[1:13:31] masterpiece
[1:13:32] 64 705 the first eve fell and was used
[1:13:38] in the second Reformation second coming
[1:13:40] as bringing forth a child now when now
[1:13:43] has become the true bride again the seed
[1:13:46] right back to the original again the
[1:13:50] Alpha and Omega is the same is the same
[1:13:54] I am Alpha and Omega he never said
[1:13:59] anything in between why because the
[1:14:08] Antichrist spirit had already entered
[1:14:11] into the church and defiled the church
[1:14:15] through the entire seven Church ages so
[1:14:19] when you look at these church ages you
[1:14:21] are not seeing the true seed because
[1:14:24] what they had false doctrine they had
[1:14:26] false ideas they were still not
[1:14:29] manifesting Jesus Christ perfectly
[1:14:34] saints of God where are we at we are
[1:14:37] coming up to the Omega R we manifesting
[1:14:42] you know the prophets of time and time
[1:14:43] again every local church would have all
[1:14:45] nine gifts operating in them I'm not
[1:14:49] picking on you guys my church doesn't
[1:14:50] have them but remember the Alpha has to
[1:14:56] become the Omega the Omega has to become
[1:14:59] exactly like everything we've seen in
[1:15:02] between was not the true 100% Jesus
[1:15:06] Christ Jesus can only come back and get
[1:15:10] the original seed right that is what
[1:15:13] he's looking for that harvest time the
[1:15:16] life they were the life they had the
[1:15:17] life in them the Holy Ghost but when
[1:15:19] they denominator became shocked or or or
[1:15:21] leaf or or a branch or something or
[1:15:24] something like that but we're cut we had
[1:15:26] to come back to original seed the first
[1:15:31] ministry and the last ministry is the
[1:15:34] same do you see where you're coming
[1:15:37] should this worry you know because we're
[1:15:40] gonna we're gonna make this rapture in
[1:15:42] order to make the rapture you have to be
[1:15:44] become the sea
[1:15:46] and to become the seed you have to eat
[1:15:48] all of the word to become the seed he
[1:15:53] said the first message and the second
[1:15:55] last message is the same thing why do
[1:15:59] you think he said read your Bibles and
[1:16:00] pray read your Bibles and pray eat this
[1:16:03] word listen to these tapes why because
[1:16:06] if you take in the nutrients of the seed
[1:16:09] or the seed life you'll become the seed
[1:16:11] and when you are fully seed the rational
[1:16:16] take place amen
[1:16:18] now in John 12 23 here we're moving here
[1:16:25] John 12 23 and jesus answered them
[1:16:28] saying the hour is come that the Son of
[1:16:31] man should be glorified verily verily I
[1:16:33] say to you except a corn of wheat fall
[1:16:35] into the ground and die there's the
[1:16:38] Alpha there's the seed there's the
[1:16:41] original seed that was in Genesis 3
[1:16:43] there was in Genesis 12 there was what
[1:16:45] that was promised all the way through
[1:16:46] that is the seed except the corn and
[1:16:52] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[1:16:53] abideth alone but if a diamond for my
[1:16:56] root this second Eve Saints is going to
[1:16:59] be exactly like him remember that quote
[1:17:03] in there says she is him it's gonna
[1:17:09] happen it's going to happen can we see
[1:17:11] it we can see it do we can you see it
[1:17:13] now oh no but we see it my faith a month
[1:17:18] if we don't see my face what are we
[1:17:20] doing here why do we even come to church
[1:17:22] saints of God we know we have to fulfill
[1:17:24] something something in us drives us and
[1:17:25] pushes us and pulls us to the house of
[1:17:27] God to gain these things saints of God
[1:17:30] we have to understand we have to get it
[1:17:32] refilling the Holy Ghost we need these
[1:17:35] gifts operating in a church now let's
[1:17:40] hit up Joseph here now we know Joseph
[1:17:42] was a type a perfect type of Christ he
[1:17:46] was a special one he's born special
[1:17:47] spiritual saw dreams and could interpret
[1:17:51] dreams supernaturals brothers hate him
[1:17:54] we know he was just like Christ right
[1:17:59] we know the story and how he was loved
[1:18:02] of the father and rejected thrown into a
[1:18:04] pitch and all those things but like we
[1:18:07] read earlier about Pharaoh and the
[1:18:10] Pharaoh had the two dreams there and the
[1:18:12] Bible said there one and there was a
[1:18:14] seven here and there was a seven here
[1:18:18] first of all I won't ask you a question
[1:18:22] why was there a famine even coming what
[1:18:26] caused that
[1:18:27] famine the Bible says that there be
[1:18:33] seven good rise up full and hearty
[1:18:36] calves and corn but then seven weak
[1:18:41] tender or very not life-giving
[1:18:45] substances rise up right another day he
[1:18:48] said there be a seven-year famine coming
[1:18:49] what caused that seven year family if
[1:18:54] you turn to Genesis 37 and one something
[1:19:06] this simple things can cause a famine
[1:19:09] Genesis 37 1 why did that seven years
[1:19:11] fan but remember God God had this in a
[1:19:13] plan he was so loving and kind he's a
[1:19:15] long-suffering and he had to precede
[1:19:18] preserve preserve his seed okay he had
[1:19:21] it all planned out he was not gonna send
[1:19:23] this famine until he he boosted him up a
[1:19:25] little bit okay but this is for a reason
[1:19:28] Genesis 37 verse one and Jacob dwelt in
[1:19:32] the land where and his father was a
[1:19:34] stranger in land of Canaan there in the
[1:19:35] promised land these are the generation
[1:19:38] of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old
[1:19:41] hey man as we know is there pastures
[1:19:44] been preaching that's the type of the
[1:19:45] bride right was feeding the flock with
[1:19:48] his brother and the land was the sons of
[1:19:50] Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah his
[1:19:55] father's wives and Joseph brought unto
[1:19:57] his father their evil report look at
[1:20:00] verse 3 now Israel loved Joseph more
[1:20:04] than all his children because he was the
[1:20:06] son of his old age and he made him a
[1:20:09] coat of many colors
[1:20:12] and we know by the message the our and
[1:20:15] my things that that coat of many colors
[1:20:17] was the head that seven colors of the
[1:20:19] rainbow in it it was actually the
[1:20:22] Covenant coat it was Joseph's a type of
[1:20:26] Christ that carried the Covenant with
[1:20:28] him and what was in that covenant by
[1:20:30] your stripes you're healed
[1:20:32] I was bruised here iniquities all
[1:20:35] healing all redemption lied within that
[1:20:38] covenant and we know what takes place
[1:20:42] and worse look here in verse Genesis 37
[1:20:47] verse 29 and Reuben turned returned unto
[1:20:49] the pit and behold Joseph was not in the
[1:20:51] pit and he rent his clothes and he
[1:20:54] returned to his brother and said the
[1:20:55] child is not and whither shall I go and
[1:20:58] they took Joseph's coat they took the
[1:21:02] Covenant that had been given to Joseph
[1:21:03] and they covered was actually just for
[1:21:06] them as well and they took that coat and
[1:21:10] kid killed a kid of the goats and dipped
[1:21:12] the coat in the blood they put the blood
[1:21:16] on the Covenant they defiled the
[1:21:19] Covenant well whose revelations Tana was
[1:21:22] that coveted angel that came with the
[1:21:24] rainbow and he dipped the coat in the
[1:21:28] blood and sent the coat of many colors
[1:21:30] and they brought it to their father and
[1:21:31] said we have this we have we found no
[1:21:35] now Dustin's boat or no saints of God
[1:21:41] they put innocent blood they they they
[1:21:44] made this coat it seemed like it was a
[1:21:46] murder like it was a slaying and the
[1:21:49] Covenant had an innocent blood on it
[1:21:52] and if you look at Genesis three nine
[1:21:54] after the flood I'm sorry Genesis 9:3
[1:21:57] every moving thing after Noah gets off
[1:22:00] the ark look what takes place notice how
[1:22:03] he ties the Covenant and this together
[1:22:05] in the book of Genesis 3 every moving
[1:22:08] thing that showed that limbs shall be
[1:22:10] meat for you even the green herbs shall
[1:22:12] I give to you but flesh with life
[1:22:14] thereof which is the blood thereof shall
[1:22:16] not you shall not eat and surely your
[1:22:18] shirt of your blood of your lives will I
[1:22:21] require at the hand of every beast while
[1:22:24] required and at the hand of
[1:22:26] I'm sorry the hand of man at the hand of
[1:22:29] every man's brother will acquire the
[1:22:31] life of man whoso sheddeth man's blood
[1:22:34] by man his shall his blood be shed for
[1:22:39] in the image of God was made so here if
[1:22:41] you kill someone you are going to die
[1:22:43] this was directly after the flood and he
[1:22:46] makes this promise it becomes what part
[1:22:49] of the Covenant here in Genesis 9 and
[1:22:52] verse 9 and behold I established the
[1:22:55] covenant with you and you and with your
[1:22:57] seed after you and jump down to verse 12
[1:23:01] and this is the token of the cub which I
[1:23:03] make between you and every creature
[1:23:04] living creatures with you for perpetual
[1:23:06] generations I do set my bow in the cloud
[1:23:10] there's your rainbow so notice how
[1:23:12] killing of the blood that blood of the
[1:23:14] Covenant now is tied with the brain bow
[1:23:16] and the Bible says if you kill a man
[1:23:18] these diseases he's not bringing
[1:23:19] judgment upon you so what what caused
[1:23:23] this famine and Joseph today was they
[1:23:25] literally they took and this is all type
[1:23:28] and shadow he could not literally do
[1:23:29] they could not kill Joseph because they
[1:23:31] continued on he was the type of Christ
[1:23:32] but they had to Godhead their work and
[1:23:34] in their - almost mimic in the death of
[1:23:36] Christ right so they took the blood of
[1:23:39] what a goad which Christ became sin they
[1:23:41] put it on the Covenant and now they're
[1:23:43] in judgment now notice think about think
[1:23:45] about this deeper we're gonna get in
[1:23:47] this a little bit deeper if that blood
[1:23:49] caused the famine the blood of goat
[1:23:52] caused a natural famine what about the
[1:23:57] spiritual so brother what are you trying
[1:24:02] to say if you look in Leviticus 26 verse
[1:24:07] 15 you want to go there God is giving
[1:24:10] all these Commandments to Israel and he
[1:24:13] says it four times in here Israel few
[1:24:16] disobey he says and if you are not yet
[1:24:20] for all this hearken to me I will punish
[1:24:22] you seven times for your sins if the
[1:24:26] Israel were not hearkened to the Word of
[1:24:27] God he would punish them seven times
[1:24:31] right and then verse 21 if you walk
[1:24:34] contrary to me I will not hearken and
[1:24:35] will not hearken to me I will bring
[1:24:37] seven times more plagues according your
[1:24:38] sins
[1:24:40] thing is a plague or a sin he says if
[1:24:44] you will not read be reformed by me by
[1:24:46] these things of all countries I will
[1:24:48] walk Kosh for you and will punish you
[1:24:50] yes seven times for your sins there's
[1:24:52] always a seven in little biggest 26
[1:24:56] verse 27 to 28 if you and that harken I
[1:24:59] told me for all this and walk contrary
[1:25:00] to means then if I will walk contrary
[1:25:02] unto you all in my fury and I am and I
[1:25:05] will chastise you seven times for your
[1:25:07] sins what was this if Israel were to
[1:25:14] reject Christ reject the Covenant he
[1:25:18] would punish them seven times where's
[1:25:22] that come from it comes from the parable
[1:25:23] in Matthew 21 hear another parable there
[1:25:27] was a certain householder he planted a
[1:25:28] vineyard and we know how God sent
[1:25:30] husbandmen over it and they planted they
[1:25:32] did well they did well for a season but
[1:25:35] then when it was time then to receive
[1:25:37] his fruits the husbandmen would that
[1:25:40] would send men in right and they would
[1:25:42] the people that took it took care at
[1:25:44] that time then would slay the people one
[1:25:46] by one but now notice at the end of the
[1:25:49] parable in verse 41 Matthew 21 verse 41
[1:25:53] they say to him he will miserably
[1:25:55] miserably destroy those wicked men and
[1:25:57] will let out his vineyard unto other
[1:25:59] husbandmen so he's going to kill these
[1:26:01] is going to take these Jews out give it
[1:26:03] to other husbandmen which shall render
[1:26:04] me in fruits in the seasons Jesus have
[1:26:08] you not read in the scripture the stone
[1:26:09] which the builders rejected the same has
[1:26:11] become the head of the corner this is
[1:26:13] the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our
[1:26:15] eyes
[1:26:15] therefore I've seen you the kingdom of
[1:26:17] heaven shall be taken from you he said
[1:26:20] what the kingdom of heaven he said he'd
[1:26:22] punished him seven times what is the
[1:26:25] kingdom of heaven it is the seven church
[1:26:26] ages and given to a nation bringing
[1:26:30] forth fruits thereof he's going to give
[1:26:32] it to Gentiles so every time in the
[1:26:36] scripture we they see us soon what does
[1:26:39] it represent
[1:26:40] it represents the seven churches correct
[1:26:43] absolutely study it out that was what
[1:26:46] was the form the first thing seven
[1:26:47] wasn't they built a seven can little
[1:26:49] stick right what was the revelation
[1:26:51] behind that we see in Revelations 1 the
[1:26:53] seven golden candle
[1:26:54] represent the seven churches what in the
[1:26:55] Gentile correct so now back to the
[1:27:01] dreams what was this one but remember
[1:27:04] we're dealing with two sevens not one
[1:27:08] what was taking place here
[1:27:10] what was God showing through the
[1:27:11] scripture there's seven good years
[1:27:14] coming there's seven good ages coming
[1:27:19] and then there's seven dry ages coming
[1:27:22] what does it mean I'm just gonna break
[1:27:25] this down real simply by the grace of
[1:27:27] God if you go to Ephesians two and six
[1:27:34] it's right in the scripture this to me
[1:27:42] thinks of God this is so exciting this
[1:27:47] is why this is what that parable this is
[1:27:49] why they all had to take place in
[1:27:52] Ephesians 2:6
[1:27:53] and has the raises to sit up together
[1:27:56] and made us to sit together in heavenly
[1:27:57] places in Christ Jesus and what is the
[1:27:59] same verse seven that in the ages to
[1:28:01] come
[1:28:05] the second seven in Pharaoh's dream
[1:28:09] remember the dream is one seven good
[1:28:12] years seven dry years the second seven
[1:28:16] is the Gentile dispensation any profits
[1:28:25] rise up in the last seven Church ages of
[1:28:27] side ours has any new Word of God come
[1:28:32] forth in the last seven Church ages
[1:28:34] things how many's gentile here to us us
[1:28:38] Gentiles how much word of god has come
[1:28:41] to us this was finished in 98 ad it's
[1:28:52] been a ye it's been seven Gentile years
[1:28:56] of famine and the Jews it was all
[1:29:02] because they stood the Christ they put
[1:29:05] the blood and put it on the covenant
[1:29:08] they slew into some blood and God sent a
[1:29:12] seven church age of famine and now when
[1:29:20] you're hungry what do you have to eat
[1:29:25] [Laughter]
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:27] amen
[1:29:29] now let's see what's the first seven
[1:29:31] years absolutely yeah absolutely let the
[1:29:33] Holy Ghost lead and guide you in all
[1:29:34] truth they meant out of the mouths of
[1:29:36] babes in Ephesians three verse one for
[1:29:41] this cause i paul the purse the prisoner
[1:29:44] of jesus christ for you gentiles if you
[1:29:47] ever heard this the dispensation of
[1:29:49] grace of god which is given to me you
[1:29:50] word how that by revelation he made
[1:29:52] known unto me the mystery which as i
[1:29:54] wrote a for and few words here whereby
[1:29:57] when you read you may understand my
[1:29:59] knowledge in the mystery of christ which
[1:30:01] in other ages
[1:30:06] remember the prophets said the prophets
[1:30:11] said in water the water separation 55:1
[1:30:13] 21 notice just speaking of it in the
[1:30:17] three decimals we could bring it down to
[1:30:19] the Old Testament through the seven
[1:30:20] church ages for the seven strokes and so
[1:30:21] forth looking to those streaks of blood
[1:30:23] there the seven different streaks
[1:30:25] represent the seven Church ages Israel
[1:30:29] natural and the Gentile Church in
[1:30:32] spiritual the seven church ages just
[1:30:35] exactly the same way and Israel had
[1:30:37] seven church ages as well all of the
[1:30:45] entire Bible was written in the Jewish
[1:30:49] times in their church ages do you see
[1:30:55] why he's Alpha Omega he's Joseph what
[1:30:57] was Joseph he was there at the beginning
[1:30:59] he was there he oversaw the entire thing
[1:31:03] the seven years of fat saints of God we
[1:31:06] are still in the four storehouses all's
[1:31:09] we have to do is eat now the bottom
[1:31:11] think about this this is powerful this
[1:31:13] was all stored up for us
[1:31:18] remember from Matthew up into
[1:31:21] revelations is only a space Matthew I
[1:31:23] believe was written right before the
[1:31:26] Ephesian Church age started before 23 ad
[1:31:30] and the last revelation the book of
[1:31:32] Revelation was a 98 96 ad so that was
[1:31:36] 130 about 60 years and 60 years he
[1:31:38] completed the capped off the book hmm
[1:31:43] but before that all the way from Genesis
[1:31:47] to Malachi Jesus Christ Joseph of all
[1:31:51] Jehovah vol geez of noon was was what he
[1:31:54] was giving the Jews the feast he was
[1:31:57] storing up all the food in the time of
[1:31:59] plenty wide prophet after prophet after
[1:32:02] prophet after prophet and the word of
[1:32:05] Lord came down oh sorry and the word
[1:32:07] Lord came down and they started speaking
[1:32:09] the word and the scribes are write them
[1:32:11] down and they recorded and now they had
[1:32:13] fresh fresh manna all and they stored
[1:32:16] right from the Prophet restoring and
[1:32:19] keeping the Word of God but when they
[1:32:23] killed the Christ when they killed the
[1:32:27] Christ our Savior it put us into a seven
[1:32:31] church age famine where there was
[1:32:35] absolutely no word going in forth and
[1:32:39] one by one martyrs died for stored food
[1:32:45] and they would not compromise on the
[1:32:48] original seed but they had to eat Luther
[1:32:52] had to eat this March and had to eat
[1:32:54] this Columba had to eat this what their
[1:32:56] food for us and the Bible said the time
[1:33:01] of Joseph that they stored up all the
[1:33:03] food in the cities hallelujah what in
[1:33:07] the seven church age cities for what F
[1:33:10] is this a smart upper dirt where was all
[1:33:12] that when don't you understand when this
[1:33:14] church age book when these service went
[1:33:16] forth it opened up the plan of God the
[1:33:20] RET you read that church's book one more
[1:33:22] time Saints that thing just beautiful
[1:33:25] opens up the entire plan we got step
[1:33:27] back and see that church age book
[1:33:29] actually helps you step back and see
[1:33:31] with this entire things about the seals
[1:33:34] one seals it reveals the Antichrist
[1:33:37] spirit within the framework of the
[1:33:38] church you can step back and see and see
[1:33:41] it right all the way through here and
[1:33:43] we're getting off all of us toward food
[1:33:49] it's so simple there were seven churches
[1:33:52] before and there's seven churches after
[1:33:57] just opening up it's just slowly opening
[1:34:00] up thanks of God what's next the city of
[1:34:04] Jericho
[1:34:05] what are those seven silences seven walk
[1:34:09] I mean I'm talking about really what are
[1:34:11] they let's hear someone preacher it's
[1:34:13] coming praise be to God now one thing I
[1:34:19] really like here at the end did you know
[1:34:20] that within the seven famine years
[1:34:23] that's when the money failed they're not
[1:34:27] our prophets say the system's gonna fall
[1:34:31] in Genesis 47 verse 23 then Joseph
[1:34:36] sentence people behold I have bought you
[1:34:38] this day in your land for fare low now
[1:34:41] notice at the end of the famine Joseph
[1:34:45] says I'm giving you extra seed he says
[1:34:52] lo here is seed for you and ye shall
[1:34:55] what eat it he said so in the land
[1:35:00] saints of God there was one last prophet
[1:35:04] giving a little bit of extra seed that
[1:35:06] open book now come down and now given to
[1:35:08] us and now this extra revelation this
[1:35:12] extra cedar was stored up with a very
[1:35:14] last scene of the last was now stored up
[1:35:16] and I've given to you for you to so what
[1:35:19] into your ground and into the ground of
[1:35:22] others and saints of God this thing is
[1:35:25] perfect the Bible is absolutely if you
[1:35:28] have I wanted this for 20 years and you
[1:35:31] just have to wait them and wait there
[1:35:33] and God will slowly open up the
[1:35:35] revelation of this word praise be to God
[1:35:40] I hope that was a blessing tonight
[1:35:43] now look what the Prophet says here last
[1:35:46] quote everyone stand by the grace of God
[1:35:49] 63 728 Christ is the mystery of God
[1:35:53] revealed help this morning Lord as we
[1:35:55] read the word may the Holy Spirit avail
[1:35:58] to us that the church might be fully
[1:35:59] established in the faith that once was
[1:36:02] once was delivered to the Saints to hold
[1:36:03] them and may as you give the vision some
[1:36:06] two years ago to store up the food we're
[1:36:10] given this little bit of food Saints and
[1:36:12] now if we eat now we can read this
[1:36:14] absolutely and the whole but allow the
[1:36:17] revelation I I find it I I look at
[1:36:21] something here and then I search the
[1:36:22] church the message engines and Lord the
[1:36:25] Lord will usually leave a little
[1:36:27] something a word or two or three or
[1:36:29] little sentence or phrase and it open up
[1:36:31] the entire revelation let's keep eating
[1:36:34] things of God I want to show you a
[1:36:36] little a little story here as we close
[1:36:40] we just had a certain brother come he's
[1:36:43] very gifted in the spirit and I got a
[1:36:47] little bit of time with him after
[1:36:48] service I want to eat a supper within
[1:36:50] there and I'm you know one of these
[1:36:55] things we have two Saints at God to
[1:36:57] become the seed to really become the sea
[1:36:59] Saints go Jesus Christ had he was he
[1:37:01] came as a man with no reputation as a
[1:37:04] servant all humility there was nothing
[1:37:07] he'd be puffed not one thing up a book
[1:37:09] there's not some puffed up about it he
[1:37:11] was just an average humble God and
[1:37:13] simplicity he brother say these are the
[1:37:15] thing about Jesus Christ is that he as
[1:37:17] great as he was he could make himself
[1:37:18] just so hungry right and I think if we
[1:37:22] get this I'm going to heat the snow this
[1:37:24] man very spiritual man he went up and
[1:37:26] he's he's from Montana and he went up to
[1:37:28] the mountains and seven peaks that was
[1:37:30] given her brother branham and and he
[1:37:35] said on the seventh peak as you get
[1:37:38] there's actually a plateau before he hit
[1:37:40] the pea and he says it's like a Razors
[1:37:43] Edge he's it's only about that wide and
[1:37:45] it's a two-mile walk this and his sheer
[1:37:47] sheer it's a two-mile walk on sheer just
[1:37:52] like a like a knife edge and you have to
[1:37:54] walk that
[1:37:55] before you can get up into the peak then
[1:37:58] and he said he was walking and he was
[1:38:00] walking on this and I don't know where
[1:38:04] he said a snowstorm come down and he he
[1:38:09] just went down into hugs like this he
[1:38:11] said god I'm gonna die I'm gonna die
[1:38:12] Lord help me out and he said he says in
[1:38:14] a moment's time he said he had this much
[1:38:16] snow on top of him just covered and he
[1:38:19] was crying out to God and he said he's a
[1:38:21] Jesus appeared to him I think she was
[1:38:24] right or behind him or something and he
[1:38:26] felt the presence of God he's not an
[1:38:28] angel he's not this was not an Inc
[1:38:30] remember Brooke Graham said he said the
[1:38:32] angel that was with him he says was a
[1:38:33] miner in here
[1:38:34] this dude was right he said bye he said
[1:38:36] this was Jesus Christ he said this
[1:38:38] wasn't he said Simon he said for some
[1:38:40] reason he said this was such a holy
[1:38:44] feeling about it he said he was there
[1:38:49] was so much pressure in that presence he
[1:38:50] is gonna die first now he said he said
[1:38:53] brother Simon he said he said as he was
[1:38:55] abused I'm gonna die cuz he felt just so
[1:38:56] much power he could not you could and he
[1:38:59] was so holy he said he said brother
[1:39:01] Simon he's a to appease that power that
[1:39:03] they're holding us he says I tried to
[1:39:05] put everything good that I have done mmm
[1:39:08] he said it meant nothing nothing all the
[1:39:14] good that he thought he did the sermons
[1:39:16] he preached the demons he cast out the
[1:39:18] people who got healed hear this he said
[1:39:20] it meant nothing and he said brother
[1:39:24] Simon then I thought well maybe my bad
[1:39:25] and he said that meant nothing as well
[1:39:28] what I'm trying to say saints of God
[1:39:31] when we come to this we must trust in
[1:39:34] his blood and his blood alone there is
[1:39:38] nothing else we can put our trust it is
[1:39:44] what he did origins and I'm just worried
[1:39:48] Saints that we remember I caught a while
[1:39:50] back on how the man said at the end of
[1:39:52] the Laodicean age it would go back to
[1:39:55] works thinking I did something for you
[1:39:59] no no thank you God getting back to the
[1:40:02] pure seed it is all Jesus Christ
[1:40:07] do you think the Apostle Paul was puffed
[1:40:10] up
[1:40:10] well I'm know he could not say one good
[1:40:15] thing about him he said he was a
[1:40:16] prisoner could Peter say anything that
[1:40:20] I've done this like no saints of God the
[1:40:23] true bride will be so humble they will
[1:40:26] realize they have nothing to do with
[1:40:28] this verse I well I'm just a hey I have
[1:40:32] nothing to do with it as well
[1:40:34] saints of God we are just trying to we
[1:40:36] have to get to the point where we yield
[1:40:38] armed vessels you know there's a quote
[1:40:46] in the in the message it seems like it's
[1:40:48] kind of reversed in the original I been
[1:40:52] studying that 20 years span from 33 to
[1:40:56] 53 ad won't wait that's so pure what
[1:41:00] made that so holy what what causes the
[1:41:03] fall and I'm talking forever what caused
[1:41:05] the follow the true church the true
[1:41:11] church you are the most important thing
[1:41:14] the laity is the most important thing in
[1:41:20] fact you are actually the powerhouse if
[1:41:24] you can get the spiritual gifts flowing
[1:41:27] in operation saints of God this body
[1:41:31] here to take over the area they don't
[1:41:34] turn the world upside down this by the
[1:41:38] years back I'm gonna tell you this is
[1:41:39] this is Antichrist spirit years back I
[1:41:42] heard a sermon and a brother preached
[1:41:44] and he was preaching he said it's safer
[1:41:48] than we do not have the gifts in the
[1:41:49] church unless they go wrong or a while
[1:41:52] he said it's safer to be like this then
[1:41:55] they have him and that is not that he is
[1:41:59] stripping he's robbing the power off of
[1:42:02] the Assembly of the church the power is
[1:42:05] supposed to be in the field because how
[1:42:09] do you know who's coming up here to
[1:42:11] preach it
[1:42:12] if this man be full of sin you should be
[1:42:15] able to call it out you must band
[1:42:17] together and a local assembly become one
[1:42:22] the Holy Ghost should be flowing
[1:42:23] operating what Gifts doing this is where
[1:42:27] I'm at this is where our church our
[1:42:28] church we want to get there - we want to
[1:42:31] produce this the true church is the
[1:42:33] Black Sea it's not just an anointed man

[1:42:56] tongues that Antichrist you if they say
[1:42:59] we do not need speakers and orator pers
[1:43:01] of tongues that's ain't that Christ
[1:43:03] because those things are supposed to be
