[43:25] so we'll see if anybody comes if not but
[43:28] I've been quiet nervous the last few
[43:29] days and I'm quite nervous this morning
[43:31] but just ask God to give me grace and
[43:34] wisdom but I know the Spirit of God will
[43:36] have its way praise God I know that I
[43:37] believe that and just bear with me I'm a
[43:41] little nervous
[43:42] this morning by God's grace so let's
[43:44] look at our scripture Malachi can switch
[43:46] over when you're ready here and I just
[43:48] got some slides here
[43:50] as you've noticed I've been preaching a
[43:51] lot on proverbs and Ecclesiastes so this
[43:54] is part thirteen by God's grace and I'd
[43:58] like to look at today I'd like to look
[44:00] at wisdom expressed in the home so as I
[44:03] read through proverbs as I told you I'm
[44:06] just catching feeis proverbs is not
[44:09] organized by thought it's just all these
[44:11] proverbs that are just thrown in there
[44:12] and you know there are a few chapters
[44:15] that have order you know like proverbs
[44:16] 31 and a few other chapters but most of
[44:19] the chapters are there's just spread out
[44:21] there's wisdom all over the place and so
[44:24] I last week I preached on the poor and I
[44:26] preached Solomon's thoughts about the
[44:29] poor which were God's thoughts right the
[44:32] mind of Christ and I kept picking that
[44:35] up as I'm reading through the scripture
[44:36] and the the next one here was the wisdom
[44:40] expressed in the home life so this one
[44:42] deals with you know parents and and the
[44:44] home and the spirit that we hold in our
[44:46] homes the atmosphere in our homes and
[44:48] all of us have a home aren't you glad
[44:50] for that we heard about this morning how
[44:52] Jose's family don't have a home anymore
[44:53] some of his family members so it ought
[44:56] to make us pray for them but also ought
[44:59] to make us make our homes the best they
[45:00] can be to glorify God so that's the
[45:03] burden I had for this morning I'd like
[45:05] to look at wisdom expressed in the home
[45:09] so the ground in the natural the natural
[45:14] ground must be prepared before you build
[45:18] a building and so this is the wisdom
[45:20] that proverbs gives us about building
[45:23] our homes you know our the life we live
[45:26] in our home is like the building it's
[45:27] like the spiritual building all the
[45:29] things we believe all the things we do
[45:31] all the actions that we allow that's
[45:33] that's the home but sometimes we just we
[45:37] just think about actions rather than
[45:39] what comes before that and what will
[45:43] explain it a little more as we go but
[45:45] the scripture plainly says in Proverbs
[45:47] the ground has got to be prepared first
[45:50] I've never seen the excavators with the
[45:52] bulldozers and they've got to flatten
[45:54] the land and they got him they got to
[45:56] get the roller out and they got to roll
[45:57] over the land and make sure it's nice
[45:58] and
[46:00] and flat and solid because they don't
[46:02] want to lay a foundation if the grounds
[46:04] not settled you not know much I'm not
[46:06] much of a construction worker but but
[46:08] I've seen it myself you know but
[46:11] proverbs gives us this wisdom and this
[46:14] applies to every single person here
[46:16] because you are still building your
[46:18] house in other words you're still living
[46:21] in a house and you still have an
[46:23] atmosphere in your home if you invited
[46:25] open meet my family night over to your
[46:27] home you know today we could go over
[46:28] today and we would walk in and we would
[46:31] feel an atmosphere if I invited you over
[46:34] to my house you would feel an atmosphere
[46:37] and as I said a few weeks ago you know
[46:39] we prayed before a worker came in and he
[46:41] said as soon as he opened the door he
[46:42] felt the wind of love blow past him he
[46:45] said he just felt the Friends of God I
[46:46] thought thank the Lord we want to keep
[46:48] that see because people can have that
[46:51] but then they can lose it if they don't
[46:53] build their home because the Bible said
[46:54] the foolish woman destroys her home by
[46:58] sin by allowing sin in the home or
[47:01] backsliding or something like that we
[47:03] don't want to destroy the home we want
[47:05] to build up the righteousness of the
[47:07] home so the Bible says that I know this
[47:09] is review but it's I'm giving you the
[47:11] thoughts as I said I'm giving you the
[47:13] spirit inspired thoughts that God gave
[47:15] to Solomon and how many believe he was
[47:18] the wisest man outside of Christ and so
[47:21] let's pay it let's pay attention of
[47:22] these and let's really examine our home
[47:24] life because as you remember from our
[47:28] text that's gonna be the whole but I'm
[47:31] sorry that's a great evidence that
[47:33] someone is born again is because of
[47:34] their home life how they live in their
[47:37] home life is their oil the dwelling of
[47:40] the wise
[47:41] you better believe there's oil in the
[47:43] Holy Ghost field home you better believe
[47:45] the Holy Ghost dwells in a Christians
[47:47] home but the foolish person they spend
[47:52] it up they don't have Holy Ghost that
[47:53] lasts all the days of their life so
[47:56] we'll look at that too so look what look
[47:58] at the Bible says prepare that I work
[48:01] without and make it fit for thyself in
[48:03] the field so how many have a work
[48:06] they're gonna do for the Lord how many
[48:08] are doing a work for the Lord you know
[48:09] you might be a mother a grandmother
[48:11] grandfather you're doing a work for the
[48:13] Lord
[48:13] how you're influencing somebody that's
[48:16] your work for the Lord but the but the
[48:20] field must be prepared the ground must
[48:22] be prepared and the Bible says prepare
[48:25] the ground first the field and then
[48:27] afterward build the house and I know
[48:32] this kind of goes back to you know
[48:34] repenting and your your conversion your
[48:37] salvation but we can apply it to fixing
[48:39] how many ever had to fix up your house
[48:41] I've never seen sometimes your
[48:43] foundation needs fixed haven't anyone
[48:45] ever seen that I've seen the
[48:46] construction workers lift up a whole
[48:48] foundation and then re fix something
[48:51] under the house and then lay it back
[48:52] down
[48:52] or maybe just replace the foundation
[48:55] maybe they took the house off that
[48:56] foundation put it on a new foundation so
[49:00] don't don't say this well oh well he's
[49:02] not preaching to me I'm preaching to
[49:03] everybody this morning this is
[49:05] applicable to everybody because before
[49:07] we build we got to make sure our hearts
[49:09] are prepared and understand what we're
[49:11] building in other words what kind of
[49:14] life we're gonna live in our home
[49:16] remember this is not my thought like I
[49:18] said I just I'm read these I've got
[49:20] through it twice and I read through
[49:21] progress twice now in the last few
[49:23] months and just seeing what the Holy
[49:24] Spirit would would illuminate to me
[49:27] so if building is obeying so when you
[49:30] obey the Word of God it's like building
[49:32] another part of your home it's like
[49:34] adding another addition renovating it
[49:36] so if building is obeying then preparing
[49:40] the heart would be giving God your will
[49:44] preparing the the ground will be giving
[49:47] God your will surrendering everything to
[49:50] him in other words cutting off your
[49:52] desires because the Bible says
[49:57] circumcise therefore the foreskin of
[49:59] your heart and be no more a stiff-necked
[50:03] so preparing the field is like preparing
[50:07] the heart and any desire that goes
[50:10] against the Word of God has to be cut
[50:12] off first then build upon it then Victor
[50:16] foundation let the heart be circumcised
[50:19] first so in other words first get any
[50:21] desire that goes against the word first
[50:24] make sure that's out of your life
[50:25] totally
[50:28] make sure it's all gone like like you
[50:32] like for example you couldn't believe my
[50:33] testimony if I said oh I'm done with
[50:35] cigarettes but yet I keep a few packs
[50:37] just in case I need a smoke right or I
[50:41] just I'll keep a few of my worldly
[50:44] movies that I really liked you know I
[50:46] really liked this person or something
[50:48] like that not really and that good
[50:50] because that really wouldn't be
[50:51] preparing the heart would it it really
[50:53] would be cutting often and separating
[50:56] yourself from everything it wouldn't be
[50:59] a true circumcision of the heart the
[51:02] ground wouldn't fully be prepared so the
[51:07] Bible gives us wisdom prepare the field
[51:09] then build prepare your heart so see
[51:12] that's why I hope you pray this morning
[51:13] did you pray and say Lord prepare my
[51:15] heart for the Word of God see then if
[51:18] you did then you can hear the word and
[51:19] you can apply it to your life and you
[51:21] can keep building the house of God amen
[51:25] hallelujah because remember the Bible
[51:29] says God be thanked that ye were the
[51:31] servants of sin but you have obeyed from
[51:34] the heart that form of doctrine which
[51:39] was delivered to you we've all met many
[51:41] people around the message that leave the
[51:43] message they obey the message for a
[51:46] while but when they leave it shows they
[51:48] never obeyed from the heart they never
[51:52] really thought well the word is really
[51:54] above everything else because that's
[52:00] what it proves their hearts never
[52:01] surrendered to the will of God I don't
[52:04] know how they can hear you know brother
[52:05] Graham's tapes for all those years hear
[52:07] I'm crying and weeping and begging
[52:08] people to come to the altar and and
[52:09] hearing the da-- sermons yesterday I was
[52:11] this in a way of a true prophet and
[52:12] women in the prayer line are just
[52:14] screaming out because God is discerning
[52:16] their lives and telling their secrets
[52:17] and they're rejoicing being healed I
[52:19] don't know how somebody can listen to
[52:20] that and then go back to rock and roll
[52:22] and sexy women with high heels on and a
[52:25] rock concert with paint and face and
[52:27] worldliness and jokes and cussing behind
[52:31] the pulpit I don't know how people can
[52:32] do that but the way the way they do is
[52:35] because they never obeyed the word with
[52:37] their heart they never fell in love with
[52:39] the word
[52:40] they knew was right they obeyed from the
[52:44] mind but they never obeyed from the
[52:46] circumcised heart you never can ever say
[52:48] Amen they built their foundation upon
[52:52] sand instead of upon a rock amen
[52:55] it's exactly right and this is why so
[53:00] see Solomon gives us wisdom we've got to
[53:02] prepare the ground first it's got to be
[53:04] a heart that's fully sold out to the
[53:06] Word of God I love Jesus so much I never
[53:09] want to hurt any other Christian praise
[53:13] the Lord I heard last week brother been
[53:15] so inspired right to preach the Word of
[53:18] God to us we must have tender kindness
[53:20] towards one another
[53:23] glory to services of that telling us to
[53:27] show kindness and love and respect if
[53:29] anybody should love you it should be the
[53:31] people in this room and I'm not talking
[53:35] and pretend love or buying your love
[53:36] with gifts that's in Proverbs to people
[53:38] by your your love with gifts and that's
[53:41] not a true friend proverbs says it's not
[53:44] gifts it's the giving of love it's the
[53:46] giving of truth so can I break after you
[53:51] can see how this applies you're like
[53:52] anybody see how this applies okay before
[53:54] you build on to your house before you
[53:56] build on to your character before you
[53:57] build on your testimony you have to make
[53:59] sure the fields prepared the heart is
[54:01] prepared that you're going to obey all
[54:04] the word because of your love for the
[54:06] word that you don't have you cut off any
[54:09] desire to do anything wrong so this is
[54:15] wisdom in the home wisdom in the home
[54:24] the Bible said wisdom is actually what
[54:25] builds your house it's wisdom and so see
[54:30] the foolish virgin could never really
[54:32] build a true House of holy ghost wisdom
[54:34] because they're not born again in other
[54:37] words their life their home life will be
[54:40] different than someone who is born again
[54:41] there has to be a difference there has
[54:45] to be some kind of difference if God
[54:47] calls one wise and one foolish there has
[54:49] to be a difference between how they live
[54:51] in their home praise the Lord
[54:54] there has to be a difference because the
[54:59] Bible said through wisdom is in house
[55:02] builded a member wisdom is skillful
[55:04] living you skilled by the by the
[55:06] leadership of the Holy Spirit you choose
[55:08] to do this and you don't do that you
[55:12] choose to obey at the right time the
[55:14] right way and you reject temptation and
[55:17] by understanding it is established and
[55:21] by knowledge which means the sermon or
[55:24] skill or perception by knowledge shall
[55:27] the Chamber's be filled with all
[55:30] precious and pleasant riches I remember
[55:33] we just preached on the poor where
[55:35] brother Branham said very few poor
[55:36] people I'm sorry
[55:37] rich people are gonna be saved Jesus
[55:39] said very few rich people are gonna be
[55:40] saved right brother Bram's I know
[55:43] brother have said penny heirs they'll be
[55:45] just as many penny heirs in hell as
[55:46] there are millionaires in hell I
[55:48] understand that too but look what the
[55:51] Bible says the Bible says if you have
[55:52] the discernment of the Holy Spirit your
[55:55] house your rooms in your house will be
[55:57] filled with pleasant and pleasant and
[56:01] precious riches amen so you can go into
[56:05] every room in your house and there's
[56:07] some treasure there I hope you had
[56:11] treasure in your closet recently and I
[56:14] talk in your wardrobe either I'm talking
[56:16] about your Holy Ghost prayer hey that's
[56:19] what I'm talking about see even a closet
[56:21] that's probably my favorite place in our
[56:23] new renovation downstairs although I
[56:25] appreciate my study but there must be
[56:29] treasure in every chamber amen how many
[56:32] say Lord let there be treasure in every
[56:34] room of my house no matter where I go
[56:37] can say this is a place where Christ is
[56:40] glorified there's treasure here there's
[56:43] treasure in our bedroom there's treasure
[56:44] in the children's room there's treasure
[56:46] in the family room there's treasure in
[56:48] the closet there's treasure everywhere
[56:50] in other words we can feel God's
[56:51] presence wherever we are this is what
[56:55] the Bible said God's not promoting
[56:57] everybody to be rich he's saying
[57:00] spiritually spiritually rich let me
[57:06] understand that I never set my timer so
[57:12] I'm gonna put it down to 40 minutes okay
[57:14] I'm guessing maybe I preach 10 minutes
[57:17] so far I honestly don't to wear myself
[57:19] up now there there is something to you
[57:22] know having children in building your
[57:23] house we preach this a few weeks ago and
[57:24] preached on Leah love to the Lord
[57:26] because the Bible said Rache and Leah
[57:28] built the house of Israel so there's
[57:31] something to be said of having children
[57:33] and building your house and and and we
[57:37] know that just not having because any
[57:38] sinner can have children so long with
[57:41] this must come the training of the
[57:42] children to make sure the children are
[57:45] brought into a house where there's
[57:46] treasure in every room
[57:48] there's worship every room is a place
[57:50] where we can worship and glorify God and
[57:52] we can feel God's presence in our home
[57:54] amen
[57:56] so we know it's more than just building
[57:58] naturally and having just physical
[58:00] children we know but that's part of it
[58:02] we know that because Jesus said in those
[58:06] therefore whosoever heareth these
[58:08] sayings of mine and doeth them is like a
[58:10] wise man which built his house upon a
[58:12] rock so anytime you do the Word of God
[58:15] you're building the house of God
[58:18] spiritually at your house amen anytime
[58:23] you choose to put on a sermon rather
[58:25] than listen to politics or something
[58:27] there's a place for politics don't get
[58:30] me wrong there's a place for it I was
[58:32] listening to the president a few days
[58:33] ago and I was listening to another
[58:37] conservative the other day but that's
[58:40] not what we mainly feed on that's to be
[58:43] a small thing that we feed on compared
[58:45] to feeding on the Word of God and
[58:51] I don't know if you saw but if you got
[58:52] an iPhone they got its gonna hope it'll
[58:55] help some people in the future they got
[58:56] a new app on here with the new software
[58:59] where it'll tell you how many minutes
[59:00] you spend on every app so now you can
[59:04] get it real you can get a reality check
[59:05] what am i doing on my phone it's my
[59:07] phone glorifying God now we should we
[59:11] don't really need that app because we've
[59:12] got the app of the Holy Spirit we've got
[59:14] the application of the Holy Ghost
[59:16] written in our souls amen we've got that
[59:19] app already I've already downloaded that
[59:21] app gods I should say downloaded to me
[59:23] amen but you understand like if that
[59:26] could be a tool to help somebody to say
[59:28] mine look I've spent all this time am i
[59:32] hearing and doing the word like it ought
[59:34] to like I said the Bible said does do
[59:36] everything in moderation right do the
[59:39] news in moderation
[59:40] do this in moderation listen to that
[59:42] idea listen get that education in
[59:44] moderation but education and politics
[59:47] can never become more important than the
[59:49] Word of God it can't influence us more
[59:54] than the word influences us because
[59:56] remember brother Graham says the only
[59:58] way to know you're an overcomer today is
[1:00:00] that you're overcoming something
[1:00:04] halleluiah church we should look at
[1:00:06] ourselves what am i overcoming my
[1:00:08] overcoming doubt anger fear loss what am
[1:00:12] i overcoming we should be overcoming
[1:00:14] something amen
[1:00:16] now it might be like Abraham you might
[1:00:18] have to wait 25 years to overcome you
[1:00:20] know 25 years am I going to receive this
[1:00:22] promise or not you you might be in the
[1:00:24] long battle we're probably all on a long
[1:00:26] battle right as far as the rapture is
[1:00:27] concerned we're probably in a long
[1:00:29] battle may be the rapture won't be next
[1:00:31] year five years maybe 25 years we're all
[1:00:34] in a long-term battle but the point is
[1:00:36] we've got to be seeing God's presence in
[1:00:38] our home helping us overcome in our home
[1:00:41] today that they find the treasures of
[1:00:43] God in our home when the rain descended
[1:00:48] when the persecution descended it can
[1:00:51] say like that when the pressure
[1:00:52] descended when the temptation ascended
[1:00:55] upon each one of us and the floods came
[1:00:57] in Satan comes in like a flood and the
[1:01:00] winds blew and beat upon that house it
[1:01:02] fell not for it was founded
[1:01:04] upon a rock I don't know about you but
[1:01:07] every time after I come through a trial
[1:01:08] and know it's over I just love to get on
[1:01:10] my knees or raise my hands of God and
[1:01:12] say thank you for bringing me through
[1:01:14] that trial I made it through that storm
[1:01:17] I Amen it seemed like it would never end
[1:01:20] it was years or or this lasted months
[1:01:22] and this for so much pressure but God
[1:01:24] you brought me through it and if you
[1:01:26] brought me this far I'm going all the
[1:01:27] way
[1:01:28] amen we've had a lot of rain storms
[1:01:33] lately in Doylestown a lot of rain
[1:01:36] storms our power went out one time last
[1:01:38] month but it's so beautiful to walk out
[1:01:41] afterwards the next morning and the sun
[1:01:43] is shining and bright but the night
[1:01:45] before there's lightning and and rain
[1:01:47] and splashing and like a little flood
[1:01:49] coming off the road into our driveway
[1:01:52] and it's so refreshing to walk out and
[1:01:55] say praise God the storms over and we're
[1:01:58] still standing amen and that's what we
[1:02:02] must have in our homes hearing the word
[1:02:04] doing the word that's what wisdom does
[1:02:07] wisdom takes the word you hear and
[1:02:09] applies prepares your heart and applies
[1:02:12] it to your life and builds upon your
[1:02:14] life in your home glory so this applies
[1:02:20] to everybody what are you building today
[1:02:21] today you're gonna build upon your house
[1:02:22] did you know that you're gonna go home
[1:02:24] and you're gonna build upon your house
[1:02:26] today how many understand that you're
[1:02:28] either gonna go home and obey the words
[1:02:30] of God something you heard today or
[1:02:32] Wednesday or something you've heard
[1:02:34] something you read in your Bible this
[1:02:35] morning you're either gonna apply that
[1:02:36] to your life or reject it we've got to
[1:02:39] make sure everyday wisdom build her
[1:02:42] house in our house amen look what the
[1:02:49] Bible says this is a nice now this is a
[1:02:50] flowchart here so let's read this a wise
[1:02:55] man is strong how many know the Holy
[1:02:57] Ghost filled believers are strong a wise
[1:03:00] man or woman is strong yay a man of
[1:03:02] knowledge increases strength so the
[1:03:05] Bible said Holy Ghost though people are
[1:03:07] strong and then they will keep getting
[1:03:09] stronger amen
[1:03:11] if thou faint in the day of adversity
[1:03:14] thy strength is small
[1:03:18] you see so if we are fainting it's time
[1:03:21] to ask God Lord forgive me I don't know
[1:03:23] why I'm fainting show me why I'm
[1:03:25] fainting give me strength to overcome in
[1:03:28] the day of adversity if our house is
[1:03:31] falling if we feel like our testimonies
[1:03:32] not where it should be then we should go
[1:03:34] to God and say God for my heart changed
[1:03:38] my heart give me strength that I can
[1:03:40] overcome the temptation and stand in the
[1:03:43] day when the storms and floods come so
[1:03:47] see strength I think my I think my
[1:03:50] flowchart was strength came from wisdom
[1:03:53] but wisdom came from obedience so it all
[1:03:55] boils down to obedience obeying the word
[1:03:59] that you read in your Bible obeying the
[1:04:02] word you hear brother Branham preach
[1:04:04] obeying the word that I preach your
[1:04:06] brother banner brother Joe Adams whoever
[1:04:08] it is obeying that word when you obey it
[1:04:11] gives you wisdom and then the Bible said
[1:04:14] the wisdom gives you strength so if we
[1:04:18] don't feel strong lately well I've had a
[1:04:19] tough week I've been weak well here's
[1:04:21] the way to get back what if we not obey
[1:04:23] what if what little thing have we left
[1:04:25] undone where we failed to obey coz once
[1:04:29] we obey that'll give us wisdom and then
[1:04:31] that will produce strength I'm gonna
[1:04:38] appreciate the book of Proverbs I find
[1:04:40] so much wisdom practical wisdom in
[1:04:43] Proverbs I like to preach it too I like
[1:04:48] this now here's where each one of us now
[1:04:51] especially the men need to pay attention
[1:04:53] on this one but it's for everybody he
[1:04:56] that troubleth his own house
[1:04:57] shall inherit the wind and the fool
[1:05:00] shall be servant to the wise of heart
[1:05:03] now trouble--the means to stir up or
[1:05:05] disturb or calamity think about how
[1:05:07] these men trouble their own house right
[1:05:12] akin what'd he do he was the head of the
[1:05:14] family he was the father the family he
[1:05:17] allowed sin he snuck sin in his personal
[1:05:19] life he brought in the home everybody
[1:05:21] knew about it they knew where was buried
[1:05:23] and he inherited the wind did he not you
[1:05:29] so to the wind you reap the whirlwind I
[1:05:30] preached on that a few months ago
[1:05:33] to think about Eli he did the same thing
[1:05:36] he never removed his sons from serving
[1:05:38] God they were not fit they were living
[1:05:40] in sin he never corrected his children
[1:05:42] like they ought to been he didn't go to
[1:05:44] the full lengths of discipline can I say
[1:05:46] like that we've got the fully discipline
[1:05:49] our children I'm not talking child abuse
[1:05:51] I'm not talking that I'm talking doing
[1:05:55] fully what the Bible says when it comes
[1:05:57] to disciplining children correcting them
[1:06:01] putting them in a position where they
[1:06:03] can succeed in or that where they can
[1:06:05] obey God in is what I want to say are we
[1:06:08] giving them the position to obey God if
[1:06:11] they're in other words if they're
[1:06:12] causing people to stumble
[1:06:14] are we taking them out of that
[1:06:15] atmosphere because that's what Eli
[1:06:19] didn't do his sons were causing other
[1:06:21] people to stumble they didn't like
[1:06:22] coming to church the parents should have
[1:06:24] took him them out of that atmosphere in
[1:06:26] order to bless the anointing or in the
[1:06:28] congregation praise God and we all know
[1:06:35] a lot what he did he looked down there
[1:06:37] and saw my
[1:06:38] Sodom looks like a Garden of Eden I'm
[1:06:41] gonna be rich down there and so he moved
[1:06:43] his family away from the messenger of
[1:06:45] the hour right and lived amongst a bunch
[1:06:49] of heathens homosexuals violent
[1:06:53] murderers con artists all kinds of
[1:06:57] things so who is responsible the leader
[1:07:01] was responsible for that and this is
[1:07:04] like I said plain wisdom right there he
[1:07:06] that troubles his own house I don't want
[1:07:07] to bring I don't want to bring calamity
[1:07:10] to my house I want to bring peace to my
[1:07:12] house and who's got the power to do that
[1:07:14] you and I got the power do that you and
[1:07:17] I we're gonna bring something into our
[1:07:19] home amen hallelujah
[1:07:21] we're they're gonna bring more the Holy
[1:07:22] Ghost into our home we're gonna bring
[1:07:24] Babylon Goods into our home we're going
[1:07:26] to bring something into our home
[1:07:28] we're gonna bring trouble in or we're
[1:07:30] going to bring the victory of God into
[1:07:32] our homes praise the Lord because we all
[1:07:39] know all
[1:07:41] works have repercussions right all of
[1:07:42] our decisions have repercussions so if
[1:07:45] we see like something's wrong we got to
[1:07:47] go back and see where did it go where to
[1:07:49] get off
[1:07:49] where was the decision I made that
[1:07:52] didn't please God that caused trouble to
[1:07:55] come into my house because the Bible
[1:07:57] said that's what happens we trouble our
[1:07:59] own selves right we stir up we disturb
[1:08:02] the Peace of the Holy Spirit we just we
[1:08:04] stir up sin in our homes by what we
[1:08:06] allow in our homes we can't point our
[1:08:12] finger and say well that's you did this
[1:08:14] and you did that let's point our fingers
[1:08:15] back at ourselves let's put all ten on
[1:08:17] ourselves right all 10 what can I do
[1:08:21] have I troubled my house or my being a
[1:08:25] blessing to my house now here's where
[1:08:33] are we got our text from by God's grace
[1:08:36] and I preached this her brother Samuels
[1:08:38] a few weeks ago when he had me fill in
[1:08:40] form there I kind of ended the sermon
[1:08:42] with this but I I've been mentioned this
[1:08:44] all throughout but see as I read the
[1:08:47] book of Proverbs like I said a second
[1:08:49] time I just catch these things about
[1:08:51] house and dwelling and home and all
[1:08:52] these things I want to bring these out
[1:08:54] tear in the house of the righteous is
[1:08:57] much treasure but the revenues of the
[1:09:01] wicked is trouble so if a family is
[1:09:06] really living righteously before God
[1:09:09] there should be much treasure in your
[1:09:11] home and we know that's not physical
[1:09:14] treasure
[1:09:15] that's not pirate's gold right that's
[1:09:18] not a treasure chest of gold from oh
[1:09:20] you'd see a prawn a pirate ship that's
[1:09:22] not the treasure we're talking about
[1:09:23] we're talking about the treasure of the
[1:09:24] character of Jesus Christ because the
[1:09:28] Bible said where a man's heart is that's
[1:09:30] where his treasure is also so our hearts
[1:09:34] especially the leaders of the family
[1:09:36] especially as men our hearts should be
[1:09:40] focused on our home that our home
[1:09:43] produces the treasure of God in our
[1:09:46] character but also that in our home we
[1:09:49] can learn how to store up treasures in
[1:09:50] heaven teaching our children to pray
[1:09:55] teaching our children to give to the
[1:09:57] poor praise God
[1:09:59] teaching our children to love the Word
[1:10:01] of God and listen to the Word of God and
[1:10:03] hear the word of God and sing the songs
[1:10:04] of Zion teaching them showing them the
[1:10:08] treasure look at this treasure at sea
[1:10:10] when when we worship God we're showing
[1:10:12] the children this is what we this is
[1:10:13] what we love we love the Word of God
[1:10:15] when you listen to brother Branham in
[1:10:17] your home your children are hearing oh
[1:10:18] my dad loves brother Branham my mom
[1:10:21] loves us into brother branham my mom
[1:10:23] loves singing to worship Jesus you see
[1:10:27] they're they're noticing what treasure
[1:10:29] are we storing up in our homes what are
[1:10:32] our rooms and chambers fill with is it
[1:10:34] filled with argument and debate is it
[1:10:37] filled with depression and sadness
[1:10:39] loneliness is it filled with
[1:10:42] discouragement and hate and fear
[1:10:45] discontentment wonder what our chambers
[1:10:48] fill with it ought to be filled with the
[1:10:49] love of Christ the treasure of God like
[1:10:54] brother and said go buy me a bottle of
[1:10:56] love go buy me a bottle of gentleness
[1:10:59] and self-control go buy me a bottle of
[1:11:02] the virtues of God it's you can't buy it
[1:11:06] for money you can only buy it with a
[1:11:07] spiritual transaction where you sell out
[1:11:10] the things of the world and you purchase
[1:11:12] God's love amen
[1:11:13] buy the truth and sell it not the Bible
[1:11:16] says it has to be a spiritual
[1:11:18] transaction and then in the house of the
[1:11:22] righteous then you find treasure see so
[1:11:25] many people they make the wrong decision
[1:11:27] they let things come in their house to
[1:11:28] make their children happy but if that
[1:11:30] doesn't make God happy it's not a
[1:11:32] treasure it's a curse in the house
[1:11:35] praise God because there's
[1:11:41] in the house of the righteous godly
[1:11:43] treasure the virtues of God here's the
[1:11:52] one we read for today there's treasure
[1:11:55] to be desired and oil in the dwelling of
[1:11:59] the wise but a foolish man spends it up
[1:12:04] isn't that just like the foolish virgin
[1:12:06] they ran out of oil they did not have
[1:12:09] any oil to last into the night because
[1:12:12] remember they were is waiting out there
[1:12:13] they're waiting to go in the wedding
[1:12:14] perception reception rather because you
[1:12:18] know this I was listening to brother
[1:12:19] Donny Reagan preached it last week but
[1:12:20] he was going through the history of
[1:12:22] Matthew 25 and I appreciate it too but
[1:12:25] the bride never knew when the bridegroom
[1:12:27] was coming they kind of knew what time
[1:12:29] it was but the bridegroom had to get
[1:12:31] ready and then they cried go ye out to
[1:12:33] meet him then they knew the bridegroom
[1:12:34] was coming out and they had to go out
[1:12:36] and join the procession that was going
[1:12:38] to the bride's house right and the
[1:12:41] foolish version didn't have the oil to
[1:12:42] go out they didn't have a light to -
[1:12:45] they didn't have a lamp to light their
[1:12:47] way they didn't have the oil to light
[1:12:48] their way and Jesus said I am the way
[1:12:50] men the baptism of Holy Ghost is the way
[1:12:54] to the procession to the rapture and the
[1:12:57] Bible said there's treasure and oil and
[1:13:01] the dwelling of the wise that means a
[1:13:05] person who's born again will live the
[1:13:07] Christian life at church and in their
[1:13:09] home like we preached on Wednesday
[1:13:12] preparing we've got to prepare to come
[1:13:13] in the Friends of God we've got to
[1:13:15] prepare that member from Wednesday it's
[1:13:18] really had to have beaten oil they had
[1:13:20] to have beaten oil they had to take time
[1:13:22] at home and they had to stomp on the the
[1:13:24] olives until oil flowed out of the olive
[1:13:27] that they had to catch the oil in the
[1:13:29] jar after stomping on the oil and then
[1:13:32] there to catch then they could take that
[1:13:33] out of the church and then the priest
[1:13:36] could work with it and they could light
[1:13:38] it up and they could contact God amen
[1:13:41] and that's how our lives are we've got
[1:13:43] to pray you know we're not really you
[1:13:45] want to stomp on Devils at home that's
[1:13:47] wonderful you want to stomp when you
[1:13:48] pray I recommend getting on your knees
[1:13:50] and stomping on Devils that's what I
[1:13:51] recommend
[1:13:52] but it's the picture of stomping on the
[1:13:56] are on the olives rather to pull out the
[1:13:58] oil and then bring that anointing that
[1:14:00] you have bring that feeling that you
[1:14:02] have about more of God and loving God
[1:14:04] bring that feeling to church and watch
[1:14:06] how God's presence is more easily felt
[1:14:08] amongst us hey man hey man because
[1:14:12] remember the Nicolaitans spirit is to
[1:14:14] get all the anointing up to the pulpit
[1:14:16] so nobody but so because nobody else
[1:14:18] thinks they have any anointing we want
[1:14:22] to say well brother just we want you
[1:14:23] anointed that's great I want to be
[1:14:24] anointed too but you all should be just
[1:14:26] as anointed as I am and the church said
[1:14:29] I can show you a quote Ram said that I
[1:14:32] preached that before here
[1:14:33] well Ram said doesn't matter how
[1:14:34] anointed I am how much I pray in the
[1:14:36] spirit and get close to God it will do
[1:14:38] no good unless you're you don't have the
[1:14:40] same anointing but where does this
[1:14:43] anointing start if we're not bringing
[1:14:44] anointing I know where it's got to come
[1:14:46] it's got to start in your home praise
[1:14:48] God
[1:14:49] it's got to start in my home I've got to
[1:14:51] start having more oil in my home we all
[1:14:53] do and bring it into the house of God
[1:14:56] amen it's exactly right I come across
[1:15:01] some thus saith the Lord quotes on
[1:15:02] prayer I'm gonna preach those soon if
[1:15:04] the Lord o let me
[1:15:05] they have just shocked me I just stood
[1:15:06] at my computer this morning I said what
[1:15:08] brother Branham said that it's thus
[1:15:10] saith the Lord about prayer
[1:15:12] so God give us wisdom to go forward how
[1:15:15] many want God's wisdom to go forward
[1:15:17] amen so this scripture shows the value
[1:15:25] of saving in the natural I'm not much of
[1:15:28] a saver in the natural huh I'm more of a
[1:15:31] spender but my wife's an excellent saver
[1:15:33] that's why we're perfect for each other
[1:15:36] because she's my saving side she's a
[1:15:39] part of me but it also shows the value
[1:15:43] of the preserving or saving or the
[1:15:47] maintaining or the trimming or the
[1:15:49] refilling of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:15:51] spiritual because the natural is a
[1:15:55] lesson to the spiritual so in other
[1:15:57] words the natural man what he's got you
[1:15:58] know all these bottles of oils you know
[1:16:00] saved up here he's got you know we can
[1:16:02] use them he can use them for healing you
[1:16:04] know like the Samaritan oil pour oil and
[1:16:05] wine on the wounds they've got cooking
[1:16:07] oil they don't use the ball
[1:16:09] or they always make sure they got plenty
[1:16:10] of oil and that's how we should be we
[1:16:13] should always make sure I got any of
[1:16:15] love for God I've got plenty of zeal for
[1:16:18] God I've always got more for God I want
[1:16:21] to do more for Jesus praise God I've
[1:16:24] already I've got this seal of God in my
[1:16:26] soul and I know I'm sealed to the day of
[1:16:27] redemption
[1:16:28] I'm a serving Jesus all the days of my
[1:16:30] life no matter what comes or goes
[1:16:32] I am treasure in the house and they can
[1:16:35] point to the treasure look at the oil
[1:16:37] and we can say look in our lives look at
[1:16:40] our hearts look at our desires look at
[1:16:42] the things that we love and see and
[1:16:44] worship and how we sing and praise God
[1:16:45] look at the oil in my house amen glory
[1:16:49] that's all we all need we should be able
[1:16:51] to say look at the oil look at the
[1:16:52] treasure in my home because remember we
[1:16:55] can all walk in our home and see what we
[1:16:57] value right what's influencing us what
[1:17:01] are we getting influenced by the foolish
[1:17:06] man he doesn't value it well I don't
[1:17:08] have to listen to brother branham all
[1:17:10] the time or I don't need to sing all
[1:17:11] that time I don't know I don't need to
[1:17:13] pray that much but see they just make an
[1:17:18] excuse it's just an excuse to limit God
[1:17:21] limit God limit God and then live in a
[1:17:23] foolish way now I want to encourage the
[1:17:33] sisters kind of along the lines where we
[1:17:35] breach on the proverbs 31 woman have the
[1:17:38] children having their needs met is an

[1:17:48] life to bring forth children and she

[1:20:14] quietness of the Holy Spirit on this one
[1:20:18] if you want to talk about a loud house
[1:20:20] when I was growing up I had five boys
[1:20:22] one girl my four older brothers and I we
[1:20:25] played literal basketball inside of our
[1:20:28] house and we would hang up a rim and we
[1:20:30] would dunk on that rim we would like
[1:20:31] nailed into piece of wood dunk on it
[1:20:33] until it breaks the wood and we would
[1:20:35] play football and
[1:20:37] so anyhow had loudness in it was our
[1:20:40] house be I want to come down to prayer
[1:20:41] you better believe my mom got it quiet
[1:20:43] to pray whether she had to spray us with
[1:20:46] vinegar or whatever she had to do and
[1:20:50] look what turned out of it she got three
[1:20:52] preachers you know I always use that
[1:20:53] because that's an example that I've seen
[1:20:55] I never we never were planning hey cam
[1:20:57] you're in a grope when you're gonna be a
[1:20:58] preacher and bro Simon you're gonna be a
[1:21:00] missionary
[1:21:00] we were never planning those things we
[1:21:02] didn't even know about the message but
[1:21:04] the investment making sure there was
[1:21:07] treasure the chambers was the most
[1:21:09] important thing
[1:21:09] make sure there's prayer make sure God
[1:21:12] is honored in every room make sure
[1:21:14] Christ is the ultimate in our house we
[1:21:18] spend most of the time in our house
[1:21:19] focusing on the right things the things
[1:21:22] of God
[1:21:23] so look redder is a dry morsel or a
[1:21:27] piece of bread better have a dry piece
[1:21:29] of bread sometimes I eat those when my
[1:21:31] children you know I eat the leftovers
[1:21:33] better is a dry morsel and quietness
[1:21:35] there with then a house full of
[1:21:40] sacrifices with strife this is what
[1:21:44] we're saying earlier a fool will bring
[1:21:45] controversy he'll bring sin into his
[1:21:47] house
[1:21:47] he'll compromise on the Word of God
[1:21:49] disputes arguing quarreling it's better
[1:21:54] to have just dry stale bread but have
[1:21:58] the ease or kind of a life it's the
[1:22:00] peace of God in your home it's better
[1:22:03] have a little and have peace of God then
[1:22:06] have all this meat and sacrifices and
[1:22:07] all this all this great goods and food
[1:22:10] and all the things you could imagine
[1:22:12] it'd be better to have just a piece of
[1:22:15] dry bread and have the peace of God then
[1:22:19] all the money and riches and anything
[1:22:21] else you could want in that a blessing
[1:22:23] that's such a blessing to me just a
[1:22:27] quiet just a life of spiritual
[1:22:30] prosperity I can see the children
[1:22:32] growing in the faith I can see my wife
[1:22:35] growing in the faith I can see myself
[1:22:36] growing in the face hey glory
[1:22:39] that's the quietness that's the
[1:22:40] spiritual prosperity we can see we're
[1:22:43] overcoming we're growing closer to
[1:22:45] Christ all the time hey hey man the
[1:22:49] wisdom of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:51] this is how wisdom is expressed in our
[1:22:53] homes so see any arguing and he disputes
[1:22:59] and according we got to get that out
[1:23:01] we've got our teachers our children to
[1:23:03] talk out their problems to forgive one
[1:23:06] another love one another and then we
[1:23:07] went with our children are busier than
[1:23:09] we on the phone or we on our emails or
[1:23:11] we or wherever we are we've got to not
[1:23:13] have quarrels and disputes and arguments
[1:23:14] we've got to be children of peace as
[1:23:16] well blessed are the peacemakers that's
[1:23:20] what Jesus said blessed are the poor in
[1:23:23] spirit Oh Lord I'm nothing just help me
[1:23:25] to be humble now you're getting poor in
[1:23:27] spirit
[1:23:27] now I'm getting poor in spirit I've got
[1:23:29] to lean upon you every hour Lord I I'm a
[1:23:31] failure at times I'm so weak Oh Lord I'm
[1:23:33] trusting in the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:34] anoint me for thy will now we're getting
[1:23:37] poor in spirit amen and those are the
[1:23:39] kind of people that God lets them
[1:23:40] inherit the earth hallelujah blessed are
[1:23:43] the poor in spirit they shall see God
[1:23:45] amen
[1:23:51] better is a little with the fear of the
[1:23:54] Lord than great treasure and trouble
[1:23:58] therewith I wonder how many millionaires
[1:24:02] would give up their money if they can
[1:24:05] avoid all the core problems that they
[1:24:07] have I wonder how many would give it up
[1:24:10] I've read I forget the the I forget
[1:24:13] which famous people I read but I read
[1:24:16] where some of them said they would do
[1:24:17] that they would give anything if they
[1:24:18] could just go back to being a regular
[1:24:19] person said of being famous because of
[1:24:21] all the the suing and all the all the
[1:24:24] the greed and lust for their money
[1:24:26] the Bible says better to have a little
[1:24:28] bit and feared God better is a dinner of
[1:24:32] herbs where love is than a stop ox and
[1:24:36] hatred therewith my hot goodness it'd be
[1:24:40] better to just have a vegetarian meal as
[1:24:43] long as loves at the table as well and I
[1:24:47] know our sisters here do that aren't you
[1:24:49] glad brothers at your sisters when they
[1:24:51] serve food they're actually serving with
[1:24:52] love you know I told you I I you you
[1:24:58] know you know you know and I just you
[1:25:00] know what a wife was upset serving the
[1:25:02] food you know what a husband who
[1:25:05] upset you know coming home from work and
[1:25:06] upset with each other you want love to
[1:25:10] be the atmosphere in your home what do
[1:25:15] you mean we've already had sound three
[1:25:16] times this week and what works so hard
[1:25:19] how come you don't have a better meal
[1:25:21] for me the Bible said it's better have
[1:25:23] herbs with love than all the meats and
[1:25:26] steaks and all the chicken and
[1:25:29] everything you could want love where
[1:25:32] love is do you feel love in your home do
[1:25:36] you feel love in your home that's wisdom
[1:25:39] wisdom will help you create the
[1:25:42] atmosphere of love in the home not a
[1:25:45] place of bickering now the place of
[1:25:46] arguing condemning quarreling it creates
[1:25:51] love wherever Christ is that's the kind
[1:25:54] of house I want to live in
[1:25:56] I believe I live in that by God's grace
[1:25:58] but I want to keep living in that house
[1:26:00] this love live at your address here's
[1:26:05] something that's good for everybody to
[1:26:07] the treasure of kind words
[1:26:11] now I'm sure everybody here you know
[1:26:14] never set a a mean word to anybody at
[1:26:17] your house right you've never said
[1:26:19] anything mean you never hurt anybody's
[1:26:21] feelings at your house I'm sure
[1:26:22] everybody pretties here it's perfect
[1:26:23] right this morning the Bible says a soft
[1:26:30] answer turneth away wrath but grievous
[1:26:36] words stir up anger I see this all the
[1:26:38] time at work children will come up to me
[1:26:40] they'll be upset with somebody else then
[1:26:42] they'll have they'll be so loud and so
[1:26:44] and I just say it real back are you sure
[1:26:47] about that can we talk about that did
[1:26:49] you ask them to say they're sorry and it
[1:26:52] did the place like a balloon it just
[1:26:54] goes like no I didn't ask them to say
[1:26:57] sorry a soft answer or turn away any
[1:27:03] wrath in your home how many know parents
[1:27:07] are like firefighters you always got to
[1:27:08] put out the fires here's your water
[1:27:11] right here it's a Holy Ghost soft answer
[1:27:16] Shh a tender what the Bible call it's a
[1:27:19] tender weak timid gentle the soft answer
[1:27:25] turns away wrath it puts out all the
[1:27:28] fires but the Bible said grievious words
[1:27:34] so painful words hurtful words offensive
[1:27:38] words stir up anger and I think you know
[1:27:46] this too but if you keep giving soft
[1:27:48] answers the child will eventually calm
[1:27:50] down eventually calm down or if the
[1:27:54] person you're within is adult all the
[1:27:55] time keep giving soft answers eventually
[1:27:58] they'll cool down but you've got to have
[1:28:02] a tender weak and timid gentle spirit
[1:28:04] remember this is how a Holy Ghost filled
[1:28:06] home looks like I'm preaching a I'm
[1:28:09] preaching a high life I'm preaching the
[1:28:11] holy calling of the Lord a soft answer a
[1:28:17] tender a timid gentle answer turns away
[1:28:19] wrath how much time they got okay ten
[1:28:27] minutes all righty proverbs 31:26 this
[1:28:30] is be another proverbs 31 woman of
[1:28:32] course she opened her mouth with wisdom
[1:28:34] and in her tongue is the law of kindness
[1:28:37] so we got soft answers and we got kind
[1:28:40] words in our tongue kindness how many
[1:28:46] want that treasure in your house I hope
[1:28:50] I hope we're not overlooking this
[1:28:51] treasure this is so valuable church if
[1:28:54] you can see this this morning it's so
[1:28:55] valuable in your home to just use soft
[1:28:58] words kind words pleasing words under
[1:29:01] God it's a treasure and if you ever
[1:29:03] lived in a house where there was
[1:29:04] argument no I other than a few you know
[1:29:06] there's a few seasons of my life where
[1:29:08] my parents were arguing a lot and they
[1:29:10] would yell and they would my dad would
[1:29:11] you know break things he'd break glass
[1:29:13] and you know do kinds of things like
[1:29:15] that you know he sometimes he just he'd
[1:29:17] do things he shouldn't have done and I I
[1:29:21] could understand because of that I could
[1:29:22] understand how valuable kind words are
[1:29:29] a tongue that always uses kindness
[1:29:32] instead of rebuke and chastisement an
[1:29:35] argument and quarrel and strife a were a
[1:29:40] person who just uses kind words that
[1:29:43] it's an absolute treasure instead of
[1:29:46] trying to fight well I'm right well let
[1:29:48] me tell you about this you're wrong
[1:29:51] instead of just trying to be right be
[1:29:53] kind cuz I've lived in houses like that
[1:30:01] where there is arguing screaming I have
[1:30:06] gone to bed crying before you know
[1:30:07] because of the arguing and screaming in
[1:30:09] the house I have so this is a very
[1:30:13] valuable treasure and the wise have
[1:30:17] treasure in their dwellings and
[1:30:21] ultimately and we know what it comes
[1:30:23] down to we lose control how many ever
[1:30:26] lost control he that hath no rule over
[1:30:30] his own spirit is like a city that's
[1:30:31] broken down and without walls we've got
[1:30:34] to control we got to we got to be able
[1:30:36] to self assess and say we got to be
[1:30:38] happy we have to be receive the
[1:30:39] correction the Holy Spirit and say I'm a
[1:30:41] little out of line here if we get angry
[1:30:43] easily or if we've got a temper some
[1:30:45] like that we've got to be able to see oh
[1:30:47] I'm not ruling over my spirit real well
[1:30:49] and we've also got to judge the spirits
[1:30:51] of our children are our children keeping
[1:30:54] their spirits under control or not if
[1:30:56] not we've got to be the ones use the law
[1:30:58] of kindness a soft answer to turn away
[1:31:01] that wrath it's exactly right some of
[1:31:08] you aren't there yet but you're gonna
[1:31:09] get there
[1:31:09] I know bangs not there he's gonna get
[1:31:11] Adam embo I know they're gonna get there
[1:31:13] they got little ones on the way go get
[1:31:15] there it's gonna take and now's the time
[1:31:18] to store up the treasure in your heart
[1:31:20] now it's time say to pray they say God
[1:31:23] give me the give me the law of kindness
[1:31:25] in my heart
[1:31:25] give me the fruit of the Spirit and give
[1:31:28] me all these things and those of us who
[1:31:30] have children we know we just want more
[1:31:31] of it by God's grace we know every day
[1:31:33] is gonna be a battle Satan's gonna come
[1:31:34] back and try to battle here and there
[1:31:36] that's okay because although Satan comes
[1:31:37] and go God always stays in our house
[1:31:39] amen he promised I'll never leave you
[1:31:42] forsake you amen we had that confidence
[1:31:45] but we've got to rule over our spirits
[1:31:47] and help the children to learn how to
[1:31:50] rule over their spirits amen so we know
[1:31:56] brother Branham taught that we need a
[1:31:58] family altar so where's your family
[1:32:00] altar where's the place where your
[1:32:02] family gathers to worship God everybody
[1:32:05] should have a place like that
[1:32:06] praise God you should have a family
[1:32:09] altar place where the family comes
[1:32:10] together just like the days of no he
[1:32:12] gathered his family around there after
[1:32:13] they got of the ark and they made a
[1:32:14] sacrifice unto God Abraham did the same
[1:32:17] thing he went to Egypt he came back to
[1:32:19] the grier there and he established an
[1:32:21] altar where he and his family would
[1:32:23] worship God family worship is one of the
[1:32:27] most crucial things you can do as a
[1:32:28] parent establish your altar and that's
[1:32:32] where problems can be talked about
[1:32:33] that's where you can give them wisdom
[1:32:35] and understanding and forgive and pray
[1:32:38] together and sing together and worship
[1:32:39] read the Bible together answer questions
[1:32:42] that's one of things I love the most
[1:32:43] about family altars answering the kids
[1:32:45] questions I'd love to hear what
[1:32:46] questions they have and then being able
[1:32:49] to try to point them to the Bible's
[1:32:52] answer so we got to have an altar that's
[1:32:57] that's up that's certainly a treasure
[1:33:00] now look at this here this is and this
[1:33:02] and I'm not preaching on just women
[1:33:04] today Church to understand I'm
[1:33:06] I'm not attacked like brother Ben said
[1:33:07] last week out I'm not a woman beater you
[1:33:09] know I'm not that I'm not a man beat her
[1:33:11] either I'm a Satan beater I like to beat
[1:33:13] up evil spirits amen but I just I'm
[1:33:16] bringing out scripture because it
[1:33:18] relates to the house I'm wringing out
[1:33:19] scriptures that relate to the home for
[1:33:21] these strings the three things the earth
[1:33:23] is disquieted which means a jeté 'td and
[1:33:25] 4 for which it cannot bear serve at humi
[1:33:28] reigneth I'm sorry when he reigneth and
[1:33:30] a fool when he's filled with meat for an
[1:33:32] odious woman when she's married and a
[1:33:34] handmaid that is heir to the mistress
[1:33:36] so all for these things the earth is
[1:33:39] agitated in other words it creates you
[1:33:41] know a bad atmosphere so a hateful woman
[1:33:45] now this could be a hateful woman it's
[1:33:46] hard to live with a hateful wife it's
[1:33:48] hard to live with that hateful husband
[1:33:50] could anybody say amen to that and that
[1:33:52] that disquiets the earth
[1:33:56] it adds it deserves the whole atmosphere
[1:33:59] and so again instead of hateful the
[1:34:03] opposite would be a loving a loving
[1:34:05] husband a loving wife a spirit of love
[1:34:07] would please the earth amen is God these
[1:34:12] all relate to your home a continual
[1:34:17] dropping is a very in a very rainy day
[1:34:19] and a contentious woman are alike so see
[1:34:24] constant trouble constant arguments
[1:34:26] constant concert it could be it can be
[1:34:28] man or woman I'm not preaching on either
[1:34:30] one preach on both if there's just
[1:34:32] constant struggle constant battle
[1:34:34] constant discouragement or or constant
[1:34:36] arguments something's wrong it shouldn't
[1:34:39] be constant
[1:34:40] there should be times of peace there
[1:34:43] should be treasure in every chamber but
[1:34:47] the Bible speaks of this constant
[1:34:49] nagging constant battles constant there
[1:34:52] shouldn't this constant battle should be
[1:34:54] should be stopped it should be solved by
[1:34:56] the power of the Holy Spirit because the
[1:35:00] Bible said be anger you can be angry you
[1:35:01] don't sin let not Sun go down upon your
[1:35:04] wrath neither give place to the devil
[1:35:06] if we let our argument continue if we
[1:35:09] let it roll over if we let the children
[1:35:11] continue to argue and fuss and let it
[1:35:13] carry over and over again we've given a
[1:35:15] place to the devil and the Bible said
[1:35:17] the earth is disquieted for that we've
[1:35:21] got to get it under the blood of Jesus
[1:35:24] we don't want continual frustration
[1:35:27] continual battles continual quarreling
[1:35:29] continue that should be stopped by the
[1:35:31] treasure in your house the oil in your
[1:35:34] house
[1:35:34] I like this God help us do this if thou
[1:35:41] has done foolishly lifting up thy self
[1:35:42] or if thou has thought evil lay thine
[1:35:45] hand upon that mouth as soon as you have
[1:35:47] a bad thought I have to cover our mouth
[1:35:52] wherefore my beloved brother let every
[1:35:54] man be swift to hear and slow to speak
[1:35:57] before you judge somebody giving the
[1:35:59] benefit out well maybe something bad
[1:36:00] happen to them you don't know why is
[1:36:04] this person like this I forget last week
[1:36:06] somebody was telling me something they
[1:36:08] were complaining about some public
[1:36:09] figure
[1:36:10] I said well maybe somebody did something
[1:36:11] wrong for them and I think it's up and
[1:36:13] wodsworth I was talking to some stranger
[1:36:14] and they're like huh I never thought of
[1:36:17] that like why is this why is this public
[1:36:20] figure acting out and doing these evil
[1:36:21] things and I said well maybe maybe God
[1:36:23] maybe something bad maybe somebody did
[1:36:25] something bad to them in other words
[1:36:27] maybe somebody hurt them so they're
[1:36:28] lashing out on others because their
[1:36:30] spirits broken so instead of judging
[1:36:33] them and just persecuting them and
[1:36:35] condemning them like everybody else
[1:36:36] might we should lay our hands upon our
[1:36:38] mouth or give them grace right give them
[1:36:40] grace speak the truth in love this is
[1:36:47] how you have treasure in your home
[1:36:49] houses are riches our inheritance of
[1:36:51] fathers and a prudent wife is from the
[1:36:53] Lord now look at this prudent means
[1:36:55] cautious he's cautious about her
[1:36:57] decisions she's very circumspect you
[1:36:59] should you'll make decisions or I'm sure
[1:37:01] she won't make decisions right away
[1:37:03] she'll judge things and analyze them and
[1:37:05] order them to make sure I belong a woman
[1:37:09] is from the Lord your brothers
[1:37:11] appreciate a cautious wife hopefully you
[1:37:13] got some cautiousness and you too that
[1:37:16] you can wait upon the Lord you can be
[1:37:17] cautious not jump it the first thing you
[1:37:19] see or make a quick decision but wait
[1:37:22] upon the promise of God this is from God
[1:37:25] Church they say from the devil this from
[1:37:27] God gives us a woman of caution a woman
[1:37:31] of preparation and planning a man of
[1:37:33] planning a man of character a man that
[1:37:35] will plan things out and be cautious
[1:37:37] that's from the Lord and where is that
[1:37:42] exercise is always exercised in our
[1:37:44] homes always because that's where all
[1:37:48] the decisions are made right in our
[1:37:49] homes
[1:37:49] there's my 45 minutes so let me see how
[1:37:52] much I got left here oh my hey I like
[1:38:01] that

[1:38:24] was dealing with the five W's that
[1:38:26] solomon stumbled into and i heard a
[1:38:27] preacher preach it was really good so
[1:38:29] I'm gonna preach at or willing Wednesday
[1:38:30] I want to get to that thought okay
[1:38:33] children listen up children and parents
[1:38:36] all right thanks Malachi you guys back
[1:38:37] to go straight there he that passes bhai
[1:38:40] and medal ahthe with strife belong if
[1:38:43] not to hit is one like that take of the
[1:38:45] dog by the ears in other words stay out
[1:38:47] of other people's trouble I see with my
[1:38:49] children you know let's say one child
[1:38:51] did something wrong another one will
[1:38:52] jump on them and say yeah they did this
[1:38:55] we don't want to bet on other people's
[1:38:58] troubles and the church said just let
[1:39:01] mommy and daddy handle that don't try to
[1:39:04] condemn them don't jump on the bandwagon
[1:39:05] of accusation and condemnation you know
[1:39:08] God help our children and God help us
[1:39:10] oppress parents too we shouldn't jump in
[1:39:14] other people's problems we should pray
[1:39:15] for them also a friend loveth at all
[1:39:19] times and a brother is born for
[1:39:22] adversity so see that's why God give you
[1:39:25] sibling so Malachi and Lydia that's
[1:39:27] that's why you were put here also to
[1:39:29] help all your little brothers and
[1:39:30] sisters when they go through hard times
[1:39:33] there they are and I appreciate how they
[1:39:34] help so much that's why they're born for
[1:39:37] the day of adversity to help them out I
[1:39:39] remember I'd never forgive this is just
[1:39:41] a silly illustration but I was a senior
[1:39:43] and I was at my last track and field
[1:39:46] championship and the year before I won
[1:39:49] the state title and this year I was hurt
[1:39:51] I had a little tweak in my hamstring and
[1:39:54] I was in second place going into my last
[1:39:56] three jumps and that was so discouraging
[1:39:58] cam walks over he wasn't even he was a
[1:40:00] Christian but he wasn't a message leave
[1:40:01] yet he walks over and he gave me a pump
[1:40:05] up speech or he pepped me up and he I
[1:40:07] just felt like I was like a brand-new
[1:40:08] man I'm like and I had this sleeve on my
[1:40:10] I was baby in my sword I'm like I take
[1:40:12] this thing I'm gonna go win this
[1:40:13] championship and my very next jump I won
[1:40:16] the championship he was born you know
[1:40:19] for my adversity and that's just a
[1:40:22] natural I'll tell you the best adversity
[1:40:24] I had and I think God my brother was
[1:40:26] there was when my brother Simon brought
[1:40:27] the message of the hour to me amen in my
[1:40:30] hour of adversity in my hour of am I
[1:40:32] going to go with denominations or where
[1:40:33] am I going to go how am I gonna serve
[1:40:34] God God brought me a brother who helped
[1:40:37] bring me the message of the hour at the
[1:40:38] moment when I needed it amen
[1:40:41] that's why brothers born to help you out
[1:40:43] in the moment of adversity so we need to
[1:40:47] be help of our helpers to our siblings
[1:40:49] we need to be helpers to our family the
[1:40:56] treasure of kur
[1:40:57] I think I'll go a little bit faster
[1:40:58] through here I just want to we know how
[1:41:01] and I've taught on this how you know we
[1:41:03] need to use correction with a rod we
[1:41:05] know that but the brand thought that let
[1:41:07] me show you a balance a little more of a
[1:41:09] balance to it because I came across this
[1:41:10] Scripture so see when you correct them
[1:41:13] with a rod a bamboo stick or whatever
[1:41:16] you use I used bamboo I don't do it very
[1:41:18] often anymore because the children are
[1:41:19] getting so well-behaved
[1:41:21] that gives them wisdom physical pain
[1:41:24] some degree of physical pain will give
[1:41:26] them wisdom the Bible says that the
[1:41:28] worst thing to do is leave them alone
[1:41:30] and don't correct them that's the worst
[1:41:31] thing you can do make sure we correct
[1:41:35] our children they know they're wrong you
[1:41:37] were wrong this is the right thing to do
[1:41:41] correct my son he shall give the arrest
[1:41:43] yeah you should give him delight into
[1:41:45] thy soul now here's the scripture now I
[1:41:48] put that read so I wouldn't miss it so
[1:41:50] I'm sorry if it you know I don't mean to
[1:41:52] get out of order but I read this this
[1:41:54] week and I was so blessed he that
[1:41:55] delicately bringeth up his servant from
[1:41:57] a child shall have him become his son at
[1:42:01] length isn't that beautiful
[1:42:04] now servants were never supposed to
[1:42:07] become owners of the the property but
[1:42:09] the Bible says if you bring up a servant
[1:42:11] the right way pretty soon you might he
[1:42:13] want to make him your own son because
[1:42:15] you brought him up so carefully you were
[1:42:18] careful look what delicate means you
[1:42:20] pampered him you treat him delicate in
[1:42:21] other words you were careful how you
[1:42:23] treated him you make sure you treat him
[1:42:25] just like Christ would I thought that
[1:42:27] was so beautiful this is the balance
[1:42:29] we've got to use a rod at times or our
[1:42:31] hand we got to you know use a little bit
[1:42:33] of a correction but we're course we're
[1:42:36] not we don't believe in child abuse at
[1:42:37] all of course not but here's the
[1:42:40] opposite side if you're careful how you
[1:42:42] do that the chastening then it'll
[1:42:46] produce a child that you're very
[1:42:49] thankful for it'll produce the godly
[1:42:51] character in them that you want to see
[1:42:54] how many would say God help me to be
[1:42:56] delicate as I bring up my children or
[1:42:58] the future children that you have now
[1:43:01] this time we don't hear too much it's a
[1:43:02] rare scripture you don't hear this
[1:43:03] preached very much but this just means
[1:43:05] raising them up very carefully was just
[1:43:08] the right thing to do if I made a
[1:43:09] mistake I'll go back and apologize my
[1:43:11] children if it was the right thing
[1:43:12] praise the Lord I always want to do with
[1:43:14] the spirit would have me to do like I
[1:43:17] heard brother Sam hunting preacher one
[1:43:19] time when I first came to the message he
[1:43:20] said brother Samuel he's talking about
[1:43:22] some of my brother to him he said your
[1:43:24] children are all upset he said you need
[1:43:25] to spank them and brother Samuel said no
[1:43:27] it's 12 o'clock at night I need to put
[1:43:28] them to bed wisdom would tell you they
[1:43:33] just need to go to bed I could stand
[1:43:35] here and spank them all day but the
[1:43:37] reality is they're up too late and that
[1:43:40] might be the parents fault we need to
[1:43:41] repent for that or let's say it the late
[1:43:43] after service you know it's late after
[1:43:45] Wednesday night at 10:30 if they're
[1:43:47] acting up you know you don't spank them
[1:43:49] you got to put into bed you got to
[1:43:50] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:53] except I understand you got to have
[1:43:55] wisdom you got to delicately bring them
[1:43:57] up I'm not saying every time you know
[1:43:58] not spank them it depends how the Holy
[1:44:00] Spirit's leading you now cuz remember
[1:44:04] the Bible said father's don't provoke
[1:44:06] your children to anger lest they be
[1:44:07] discouraged and discourage means they
[1:44:09] have a broken spear I could never serve
[1:44:11] god I'm some so foolish I'm so I'm so
[1:44:14] useless so if we provoke them if so see
[1:44:18] this is parents who do it on purpose
[1:44:19] like a dad who would purposely enjoy
[1:44:22] disciplining his children in the wrong
[1:44:24] way that will discourage them because
[1:44:29] the Bible said don't provoke them don't
[1:44:30] stimulate them too much don't stir them
[1:44:32] up don't try to get them to feel bad
[1:44:35] don't embarrass your children right let
[1:44:37] me can say amen to that well let me show
[1:44:40] everybody here at the church how great
[1:44:41] down here come here maokai let me spank
[1:44:43] your heart you know we're not here to
[1:44:46] embarrass people we got to be careful
[1:44:49] our our children don't embarrass each
[1:44:50] other we can't let I can't let my
[1:44:53] children embarrass each other because
[1:44:55] that will provoke them as well I'm
[1:44:57] trying to get her mad on purpose I'll do
[1:44:59] this to that I'll get her mad I'll try
[1:45:00] to get him mad on this or this
[1:45:02] was that doing tricks like that or you
[1:45:04] know evil desires and things like that
[1:45:05] we're not this theorem up we're supposed
[1:45:07] to be children of peace we don't want to
[1:45:11] break people's spirits we don't make
[1:45:14] them feel hopeless and helpless like
[1:45:15] there's no help we want them to feel the
[1:45:17] presence of God we want them to see the
[1:45:20] treasure in our chambers amen
[1:45:25] the Bible said said he was like a nurse
[1:45:27] did you know Paul said this did you know
[1:45:29] he was a preacher and he said we were
[1:45:32] among you like a nurse cherished her
[1:45:34] children you ever seen it watching my
[1:45:37] wife and watch Naomi take care of that
[1:45:39] baby there that's how we should treat
[1:45:40] one another is that right
[1:45:43] that's a Paul said as a nurse so nursing
[1:45:45] mother as she takes care of that baby
[1:45:47] that's how we should treat one another
[1:45:48] oh my keep them warm tender love care C
[1:45:55] withhold not correction from the child
[1:45:57] now these are the scriptures where
[1:45:59] people misunderstand if thou beatest him
[1:46:01] with the rod he should not die
[1:46:02] thou shalt beat him with the rod and
[1:46:04] shall deliver a soul from hell but we
[1:46:07] don't condone child abuse it's a balance
[1:46:10] it's wisdom and that's not what the
[1:46:13] Bible's saying but people take it the
[1:46:14] wrong way
[1:46:15] chasing thy son while there's hope let
[1:46:17] not not thy soul spare for his crying
[1:46:19] gotta do it early and we've got as
[1:46:23] parents as adults we've got the model
[1:46:25] and teach repentance if our husband
[1:46:28] won't repent we've got a model
[1:46:29] repentance if our wife won't repent
[1:46:31] we've got the model repentance so they
[1:46:32] can see what it looks like so they know
[1:46:34] they can learn how to repent he that
[1:46:38] covers his sin should not prosper but
[1:46:39] whoso confesseth and forsaketh them
[1:46:42] shall have mercy amen
[1:46:45] train up a child in the way he should go
[1:46:47] when he's old he will not depart from it
[1:46:49] I got a new thought on this did you know
[1:46:50] this word trains only used four times in
[1:46:53] the Old Testament it means to dedicate
[1:46:55] like when Solomon dedicated the house of
[1:46:57] the Lord
[1:46:58] this gives train a brand new meaning
[1:47:01] it's not telling you no go clean your
[1:47:02] room go wash your dishes
[1:47:04] that's not training train the dedication
[1:47:07] means the sacrifice so training is when
[1:47:11] you go and do it with your child you
[1:47:14] make the sacrifice and you show them how
[1:47:16] to do it time and time and time again
[1:47:19] that's training up why don't you listen
[1:47:22] to me I told you to put your clothes on
[1:47:23] the right way I told you do your hair
[1:47:25] the right way that's not training that's
[1:47:28] fussing training is when you take them
[1:47:31] and you make a sacrifice and you go and
[1:47:34] offer sacrifice to God and you take the
[1:47:36] time and you show them exactly how to do
[1:47:38] it and you do it with
[1:47:38] soft answer you do it with the law of
[1:47:42] kindness in your mouth that's training
[1:47:45] your children it's like all the
[1:47:47] sacrifice that Solomon offered one after
[1:47:49] another it was a lit of sacrifice
[1:47:51] sacrifice and that's what we do must
[1:47:52] sacrifice ourselves in order to train
[1:47:55] the children amen
[1:47:58] there are many devices in a man's heart
[1:48:01] nevertheless the counsel Lord shall
[1:48:03] stand because foolishness is bound in
[1:48:05] the heart of a child we all have we all
[1:48:06] had foolishness in our heart right
[1:48:09] thank God the counts of the Lord shall
[1:48:11] stand thank God now look at this even a
[1:48:16] child is known by his doings whether his
[1:48:18] work be pure or whether right so see our
[1:48:20] children if they're not doing right
[1:48:21] we've got to help them do right that's
[1:48:23] why if my child wasn't doing if Malachi
[1:48:25] wasn't in the computer right I neither
[1:48:27] get him off the computer and I go sit
[1:48:28] down there and show them how to do the
[1:48:29] computer which I already did but if he
[1:48:32] wasn't doing it right I'd do that to him
[1:48:34] because that's what the Bible says our
[1:48:36] children aren't gonna be known by their
[1:48:38] works so they're gonna be known their
[1:48:40] work show how well we train them so his
[1:48:44] face faithfully trainer faithfully
[1:48:46] sacrifice and help them there do it the
[1:48:48] right way
[1:48:52] now I'm gonna skip I'm just gonna have
[1:48:55] to close here I'm I appreciate that you
[1:48:57] want me to preach all day I do I do but
[1:48:59] let me let me find ya there's treasure
[1:49:01] and training yeah let me I'm just gonna
[1:49:07] close with that mom we stand our feet
[1:49:08] here I'll just make sure I close that's
[1:49:11] we're preparing the next generation yeah
[1:49:13] let's say North Pier because the Bible
[1:49:15] said there's going to be a generation
[1:49:17] that curses their father and mother and
[1:49:18] does not bless their mother they're
[1:49:23] going to be pure in their own eyes yet
[1:49:25] they're not washed from their filthiness
[1:49:26] there's going to be a generation how
[1:49:28] lofty are their eyes and their eyelids
[1:49:30] not lifted up there's a generation whose
[1:49:32] teeth are swords and their jaw teeth is
[1:49:34] knives to devour the poor from off the
[1:49:37] earth and the needy from among men why
[1:49:40] would a child curse their own mother and
[1:49:42] father
[1:49:43] the only answer would be that they
[1:49:45] didn't follow the Word of God all the
[1:49:48] Scriptures we just show you
[1:49:49] soft soft words soft answers kindness
[1:49:52] spending time with your children showing
[1:49:56] them how to do a training that making a
[1:49:58] sacrifice spending that time with them
[1:50:00] not just telling them telling them
[1:50:02] telling them but showing them with love
[1:50:04] in our hearts wisdom is expressed in her
[1:50:09] home and when like a proverbs 31 woman
[1:50:12] when we do that the Bible said the
[1:50:14] children arise and call the parents
[1:50:16] blessed oh my mom was a blessing to me
[1:50:19] all my father was a blessed I'm sure
[1:50:21] Naomi can say that he raised a little
[1:50:23] heart I know I could say that about my
[1:50:24] mom and my dad to some degree you know I
[1:50:27] can say that all there's such a blessing
[1:50:29] in this way that way but all this must
[1:50:33] be done first there must be treasure in
[1:50:35] the house of the wise praise the Lord
[1:50:40] yeah brother Branham said I didn't get
[1:50:41] this quote up there but brother Branham
[1:50:42] said we've got to leave footsteps if
[1:50:43] there is another generation we've got to
[1:50:45] train them we've got to show them how to
[1:50:47] walk and the way we show them is live it
[1:50:49] in our homes amen let's stop right there
[1:50:51] by God's grace now Kai if you'll come
[1:50:53] here thank the Lord praise God let's bow
[1:51:10] our heads here I like to just help you
[1:51:14] pray with you by God's grace as we bow
[1:51:19] our heads let's think about our home
[1:51:20] life here again this is a you know
[1:51:23] that came to me as I read through this a
[1:51:24] couple times and think about our home is
[1:51:31] is our home a place where love dwells is
[1:51:39] there more love and patience and
[1:51:41] forgiveness and mercy or some of our
[1:51:43] arguments and quarrel and strife
[1:51:45] bitterness
[1:51:47] [Music]
[1:51:48] anger the Bible said there's treasure to
[1:51:53] be desired
[1:51:54] and oil in the house of the wise and you
[1:52:14] know the quote brother branham said
[1:52:15] there's things we got a kick out of our
[1:52:17] house because the token cannot be
[1:52:19] present in our house when those things
[1:52:21] are in our house the token is the love
[1:52:25] of God I'm gonna say brother just pray
[1:52:36] for me how many raise your aunt's they
[1:52:38] pray for me that my house can be a house
[1:52:41] where oil is pray that there can be
[1:52:43] treasure in every chamber or bless those
[1:52:45] things please pray for me I'll pray for
[1:52:47] you Father in heaven Lord you saw the

[1:53:06] God
[1:53:07] Lord you saw the hands my hands up I
[1:53:10] want a house where nor wisdom dwells
[1:53:12] where oil is stored up or gone

[1:53:36] the family members are not provoked but

[1:53:45] they're appreciated father God we know
[1:53:57] our home life tells our real spiritual
[1:53:58] life we know that or this message is
[1:54:04] applicable to every person no matter how

[1:54:08] matter because we are a whole we all
[1:54:10] have a dwelling place so may there be
[1:54:14] oil in every dwelling place - what I've
[1:54:21] faithfully preached through word I
