========================================

I want to preach that thought I mentioned on Wednesday that I got well listen to brother cam Genesis 3 verse 8. Genesis 3 verse 8 I'd like to greet everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's good to see the Saints in the house and Lord I think all the saints are here if I'm not saying who accepts sister very thankful everybody's healthy in the service of the Lord worshiping the Lord today praise God what a privilege to serve the Lord amen Genesis 3 verse 8. we turn in there just again I met announced this Wednesday for those who can make it brother cam was going to have Revival services on April 6th through 9th it's a Thursday through Sunday brother Brooks would preaching Thursday Friday but then he's got to leave on Saturday and Sunday for the cam asked me to preach Saturday and Sunday so um uh just feel free to text me or let me know off your service your honest feedback or whenever in the next few weeks if you can't make it it's totally understandable I told Cam you know it's likely not all of us will be able to make it so I said brother cam could you and three or four of your families maybe come the next month and we could have Revival services at our church and he said definitely uh so totally understand if you you know you can't travel or anything like that but I just I really feel like I need some time in the presence of Lord there you know that's all my spring break and so I like to be a part of that by God's grace so that'll be April 6th through 9th and then brother Brian Hawkins will be here uh in March 12th by God's grace so I texted him yesterday and he's excited about coming we've always had wonderful services with brother Brian he's a faithful servant so I'm very thankful for God's grace Genesis 3 verse 8. it's like to preach on Isolation part four with a subtopic of hiding from God you remember last week brother cam preached on Adam and Eve hid from God and how you know that applies to us both random said the same and so when I heard cam say that and they call it that's a good sermon that would line up with the isolation series I don't know if I got 10 sermons out of Cam's sermon but I at least got two Wednesday and then today probably some more by God's grace so blessed to hear those words of life verse 8. well I'll read in verse 8 and then I'll read nine and ten myself so let's do that one two three and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden now read nine and ten and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto God today Heavenly Father we just want to give you thanks and praise for today Lord God thank you Lord that you are our portion Lord God in this text right here Lord Adam and Eve had lost their anointing they had lost their their innocence all they had was you Lord God Satan had stole from them Lord God the enemy comes to steal kill and destroy but Lord you have come that we might have life and have it more abundantly Lord so Lord even in this text you are the portion Lord that we have need of the Lord God so we thank you Lord God Hallelujah in our in our moments of Shame and our moments of guilt you are always our portion dear Gods we thank you God Lord I'm drawing on your inspiration from last Sunday's the Lord just guide me I'm just reporting for service as well I Need Your Grace today Lord of God each and every one of us Lord are relying upon you Lorna are you Minister each and every need today God may your will be accomplished for today Lord we're happy to gather it's a joy to gather and thank you for Lord seeing all the saints and be with our sisters see you Lord I pray God you'd restore her story father bless this reading of Thy word meet every need I pray in Jesus Christ's name the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated hard to imagine the depths guilt and shame that Adam and Eve must have felt In This Moment we don't know how long but for some time they had enjoyed perfect Fellowship brother Brandon dramatized I've reached a message on this I think last year about the cool of the evening and brother random said you know for a while they had perfect fellowship with God Adam would take Eve around the garden show her all the animals they would experience nature and its perfect condition so the ram says that you know that Adam could calm the winds by the spoken word for the ram said that they would lay down with the tiger the male tiger and the she tiger and they had perfect Fellowship and then it's hard to imagine you know how they would feel In This Moment you know as Eve somehow gets away from Adam she got away from her headship and somehow she gets alone with the serpent and this human-like creature is able to talk to Eve and disarm her spiritually somehow able to talk to her and deceive her that somehow that God's word wasn't true that God was holding them back from something and church let's just remind ourselves God's not holding us back from anything today praise God wants us to live an Abundant Life praise God the only case is is that you know if we feel like we're held back it's probably our own feelings and they're probably wrong all right or we just got to wait on God's time for something praise God we really got to look and see what did God promise me right some people think you know God made a promise of this or that but really got to make sure it's really from God what did God promise me God didn't promise us a flowery bed of ease right that's why we were made to be soldiers we're like it under soldiers we're liking under Vineyard workers at the end of the day picking the grapes there were big Grapes of course I don't know but that's like but this is the illustration God gives us and somehow Satan is able to deceive her and say you won't die but God knows this so Satan always makes it seem like he knows more than what we know regarding what God thinks Satan thinks he can convince us of what God really means and we don't need Satan to interpret the word to us hallelujah God's word interprets itself Hallelujah as we heard brother cam beautifully say why didn't Eve just say well just wait I'll just wait till God comes down what a beautiful thought that was I I'll just wait to hear from my husband let me talk to my husband first before I make a decision what a great lesson church that we we should all learn to wait upon the Lord let's wait if there's a question Hallelujah if there's a question let's put it before God and wait for the answer from God let's not make uh let's not make a choice before we actually have the right answer praise God let's go before God In Prayer especially if it's questionable brother says if there's anything questionable he says don't do it so let's really wait upon the Lord as we uh as we ask you know questions and as we we wonder about things and and so at some point Eve lets her guard down and has uh this intimate action with the serpent and uh in that moment we don't even know how she felt we don't even know how how either of them fell and then Adam comes here Adam finds Eve in the state and she's got the she's had the forbidden fruit and and Adam realizes she's going to die if I don't participate with her and so then Adam partakes and as soon as they they're done as soon as they're done we would just dramatize a cold wind blows over we'd say and and the perfect conditions now change and they go find leaves they pick leaves off a tree and sow them together and try to clothe himself with fig leaves and right on schedule god comes down at the cool of the evening and the Bible says the voice of God was walking praise God God's voice walks amen God's voice moves I'll say like this God's voice comes looking for us praise God Hallelujah God's voice goes walking in the garden and think of the level of Shame and guilt that they felt Eve is now feeling guilty for two intimate Acts two two oh I broke God's word there I I took I took one that was not my husband and then with my husband and she feels ashamed uh how could we imagine more shame than that and she knew better right she knew the word of God and then Adam here feels shame ashamed and God's voice comes to them in just a beautiful picture of God going after mankind to redeem them God did not let them stay separated but God went to them praise God hallelujah amen Oh Amazing Grace amen God God initiated the Redemption praise God Adam and Eve didn't initiate Redemption so God had to initiate I'll redeem my own Fallen children who have gone against my word and they've transgressed my Covenant they've broken my law but God wasn't surprised amen because God already before the foundation world had slain the lamb in his mind amen so God is just seeing it all play out you see it all play out he had this perfect plan praise God someone said this week some preacher said that this wasn't the perfect will of God it hadn't been the perfect will of God God allowing his children to sin had to be the perfect will of God or else the lamb slain the mind of God wasn't the perfect one of God right it had to be God had to God wanted to write a story of redemption praise God it had to been and then the Bible says in Romans 12 that you and I can prove the perfect will of God the perfect will the perfect not a permissive but we can prove we're in the perfect will of God and so God finds his children in the most utter shame they could possibly imagine no doubt they're PR they're probably cold right after the sin and and also got his leaves when was the last time leaves made you warm can anybody think of that anybody been out there in the in the fall or the spring and well I'm a little cold I think I'll go I'll go put some leaves together and try to warm myself they were they weren't the leads weren't accomplishing what they wanted them to accomplish it was a man-made religion just like a denomination in other words they went to a denomination instead of going to God hallelujah a man-made way for coverage a a man-made covering we'd say man-made religion but man religion fails every time you and I are trying to be good good enough and make it to heaven on our own merits will never work we've got to make it by the grace of God hallelujah we've gotta we've got to recognize that God will provide himself a sacrifice praise God and we've just got to accept his sacrifice like like brother Brown says you know our our father and mother according to the flesh you know are the first parents the first ones are the ones that hid from God right they hide themselves and uh and then God brother man said God went shouting Adam where are you Eve where are you and God was showing his desperate love for his children the ram said he shouted we'll get to the quote in just a moment here God says where are now God knew where he was now look at this God is a drama writer God loves drama because God knew where they were but he says where are you but God knew where they were God loves drama God loves to move our emotions amen right he loves it when we can cry for him or Rejoice for him Hallelujah he loves emotion he loves he loves showing us his grace and compassion and he cries out where are you where are you son where's where's my daughter and Adam says I heard your voice and I was afraid instead of this instead of God's voice being soothing like it used to be now it causes fear same voice The Voice never changed but the believer's uh lives changed the Believers uh condition their minds changed same voice and so he says I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eat another tree where have I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and again God knows the answer this question but he likes to he likes to dramatize he likes to pull out a people he likes to discern the thoughts and intents of their hearts praise God he wants his creatures to see what's in their heart praise God so they can they can uh they can repent of what's in their heart and let God form a new heart in them praise God and notice the man what does he say he says the woman whom thou gave us to me she gave me of the tree and I did eat so again he he puts the blame off himself where does Adam ever take responsibility in this text he doesn't he puts it off on his wife so he learned a lot of great lessons church when we when we sin or if we if we were Sinners when we were Sinners before we got saved we didn't want to admit our mistakes but God wants us to admit our mistakes praise God and we see and character If we're honest with ourselves sometimes we don't admit our mistakes even after we're saved praise God right we don't always say it's not easy to admit our mistakes but we see this example this we see how this is Humanities this is our flesh's natural reaction blame somebody else so see that when we we're in a shameful a guilty condition when we're ashamed of ourselves we have to make sure that we don't push the blame on other people we got to push the blame on ourselves praise God right none of us are going to be able to point the finger at God and say Lord you never made a way for me to make the rapture or Lord you never made a way for me to get the Holy Ghost the Bible says if any man hunger and thirst praise God let him come and drink on the Waters of Life freely praise God the only he said everybody all you have to do is come and drink praise God whosoever will let him come I like where brother random says he said Adam realized he was lost and he know that he had done wrong and it made manifest before him that he was in the wrong instead of calling oh Father come to me I've lost so instead of running to God say God I broke your commands he went and he goes and hides he went the wrong direction praise God he put it in reverse and said I put it in forward right he said I've done wrong I've been deceived come to me now the Bible says he wasn't deceived right so there we go again how not every word on the tapes is thus saith alone right the Bible said he wasn't deceived and it was God going up in the gar up and down the garden screaming Adam where are thou isn't that the same today you can show men or women by the word of God when a person's failed right isn't that how you know we try to interact with people we we ask God Lord give me a moment I can witness to somebody and let me show them their wrongs we know they're wrong we've seen their lives so many times and we just say God give me a chance to show them they're wrong and church nine times out of ten when we get that chance they just stay right in the same thing they're doing because that's Fallen Humanity Hallelujah few there be that find this narrow road but God in his grace makes a way so everybody knows there is a road praise God there is a way out of sin amen there is a way of Holiness praise God Hallelujah Adam had failed he failed the word of God now like what Albert Barnes says here Adam confesses he's afraid of God but because he was naked but there's an instinctive hiding of his thoughts from God In This Very speech so he responds to God but he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't do he doesn't say all he should have said he mentions the nakedness but not the Disobedience from where it arose so God I'm feeling this way but I'm not ex I'm not confessing why I feel this way it was my fault I'm feeling this way he should have said I've sinned I went against your commands and I'm feeling naked right so we see he's not learning he didn't confess the right way but Jesus then in the gospels shows us the correct confession we see the Holy Spirit coming to the uh The Prodigal and the pig bed and the Bible said he finally comes to himself amen he finally comes to his right mind and he said I'll go to my father and I'll say I've sinned against heaven and I've sinned against you praise God and so Jesus shows us this is the way back praise God to recognize you you have to go to the person you sinned against you've got to you got to go back to God the God you've sinned against and you have to say first of all I'm guilty I'm the one who sinned Lord God forgive me the guilt's on me I need Mercy praise God the fact that Satan wants to lie to us and tell us there is no more Mercy there's still Mercy praise God Hallelujah as long as there's time here there's still Mercy praise God God still has Grace for us praise God it hasn't run out Hallelujah so we see that's how a real son or daughter of God repents praise God but we're not perfect I'm not saying I'm not patting myself on the back saying I always run to God when I make mistakes I don't think you would say that either but we see we see two examples Adam and then we see the prodigal and we want to strive to be a prodigal praise God now I know we're already saved and everything about but it's the example it's the idea of I realize I've come to myself I realize what I've done and I'm going to go to God and I'm going to confess my sins and then the Bible said and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them so here God provides forgiveness for Adam and Eve through a sacrifice and they get clothed in their sacrifice talking about hiding from God So Adam and Eve isolated themselves but then God comes to find them and then God covers over their sins they're feeling ashamed they're feeling naked they're feeling exposed and God said I'm going to cover your shame amen I'm going to provide a sacrifice that will cover your shame and you won't feel ashamed anymore praise God hallelujah this is God's mercy this is God's grace amen this is what God does when we isolate ourselves he comes us and brings us out of our own isolation amen Hallelujah I love what Matthew Henry said he said but God made them coats of skin large strong durable fit for them see God didn't make a mini skirt for Eve the Bible said it went down from her her shoulder all the way down to her her feet praise God if you look it up in the Hebrew such is the righteousness of Christ therefore put you on the Lord Jesus Christ God will always provide us with a covering that's fit for us praise God 's not going to forgive just half our sin and then leave the rest hanging there to make us feel guilty God's going to cover over all of it praise God he's going to give you exactly what you need praise God because he's the one that came to say praise God and he wants to love you you're his child praise God he wants you to walk in truth amen God Will Make A Way so church if God made a way for Adam and Eve to cover their sins and and as as awful as they were sexual right Disobedience so thus say the Lord all these things direct Disobedience if God was faithful to close clothe them out of their mistakes God will be faithful to clothe us as well praise God amen that's what the Bible says here in the context Paul says let us walk honestly as in the day how many had a good honest week Hallelujah told the truth did what was right didn't deceive anybody not in rioting and drunkenness thank God we're not writing and there's no drunkenness praise God not in chambering and lanternness I can never say that word not in strife and envying so Strife is is battles and arguments with others and envying is wanting what belongs to someone else coveting so that that's these are examples of of not putting on Christ of Walking In the Flesh but Paul says put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof in other words don't plan out a dishonest Act don't plan out rioting or drunkenness or these I can't remember what those were or strive for end ring or any sin don't plan it out but just stay faithful to God put you on the Lord Jesus Christ keep the anointing of Christ on our lives praise God and starve the flesh don't feed the flesh but keep the anointing of the spirit of God on your life praise God amen So Adam and Eve were clothed with literal lambskins but we're closed with the anointing of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that's how we know we got the anointing on we're not walking in the flesh we're walking in the spirit Glory Paul says the same thing another place therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ it hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation so I want to look at that definition or reconciliation is to exchange we have a we have a Ministry of change a Ministry of exchange as when you exchange coins for equivalent value think about that this also means we have the ministry of returning to favor with God we were out of favor with God but now we're in favor with God your ministry is now a Ministry to show people the favor of God right and it's not uh it's not the it's not the Prosperity Gospel that's not the gospel the gospel is Jesus Christ forgives your sins fills you with the Holy Ghost and prepares you for battle praise God hallelujah that's right and God will give you favor in your battles praise God because listen Church we're all going to have battles we're all going to have struggles like like Ecclesiastes says all these things are common to all men but there's only one group that has a favor of God that's the group that's except accepted the sacrifice of Christ Hallelujah amen we have a Ministry of favor a Reconciliation to it God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself so God used the body of Jesus to give favor back to the Believers not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of favor or the word of reconciliation the word of change now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ's dead be you reconciled to God so Paul Paul says I'm in Christ's stead I'm in Christ's place I'm Paul will say I'm preaching today and it's I'm standing in Jesus place in other words if Jesus was here he would say be reconciled to me praise God Hallelujah for he hath me here's here's the exchange he hath made Jesus to be our sin who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so when God looked at Adam and Eve and the Skins he saw righteous and he saw the Lambs were were guilty he exchanged it oh my God hallelujah he reconciled them praise God I now see you as righteous yes there's consequences but I see you as righteous praise God we're back in Fellowship we can have communion again praise God Hallelujah so the same thing happens with us but we have a far much more greater sacrifice amen hallelujah praise God Amen far greater now we're ambassadors for Christ we're representatives of Christ now we can't take this too far and say uh we're the greatest people on the Earth I wouldn't say we don't go that far but we are in the place of Christ we are in the place of Jesus disciples we are the True Believers for this day and our ministry is a Ministry of reconciliation it's our duty to let others know that God can favor you if you repent of your sins God will favor you God will bless your life praise God in other words don't hide from God praise God don't hide from him come to him and God will give you favor praise God because every single person has to do this amen there's not one of us that doesn't have to come to God we all need to come to God we all need to repent of our sins we all need God's favor God's drawing all of us to him praise God so park in other words be saying I'm giving we have the ministry of reconciliation because we've been reconciled Hallelujah we know what it's like to be saved and forgiven we know what it's like to to fall short of God's glory and we also know it's like to go from God's anger to God's favor Hallelujah we've had that Divine exchange amen hallelujah thank the Lord and so see after we confess then God sees our sacrifice because the Bible says for ye are dead now I'm alive today you're alive today so what does this mean it means your desire for sin the unbelief of your soul is dead because the Bible said you were dead in sins but you've been quickened by Christ Hallelujah so we are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God Hallelujah that's just that's a verse I think we could marinate on for a couple a couple hours by God's grace I could probably preach a few hours on that your life you are dead and your life is hidden with Christ in God what is your life it has to be your soul right your flesh isn't in in God right your flesh is in the world right your mind your mind is sometimes is too much on the world and the church said right we are our mind gets on worldly things and it's not always in God but if our soul is saved if our soul is filled with the Holy Ghost then that is our life and God hides it with Christ in God hallelujah our life is hid with Christ in God Hallelujah and then is that a beautiful thought as much as Satan attacks us and as we go through the daily battles of life we have this assurance that when I'm under when I'm under attack when I'm going through difficult times we have this assurance I can hide in Christ Hallelujah the Bible didn't say your life will be hidden in Christ the Bible says your life is hid in Christ praise God so in all of our trials and all of our deepest darkest moments or our greatest uh trials that we go through we have this this confidence that God hides our life in Christ so in other words no matter what happens is natural life I've got spiritual life amen no matter what happens in the natural flesh I've got eternal life praise God and Satan can't touch that if that life is in God then Satan can't touch it hallelujah oh thank God Amen you know many of our battles we can see then in all of our battles we just have to differentiate between the body the mind and the soul see because how many times Church in the midst of our trials how many times we feel like oh I'm really hiding in God if we don't feel like that then we're spending too much time in in the mind right or dwelling on the flesh rather than knowing the confidence that we have for our soul is in Christ see I just thought that was a blessing praise God so there's no reason to hide from God he wants us to hide in him praise God hide in him Little Brown says it here plainly in a future home Satan cannot bother how many can say Amen to that well who was he bothering this week who I'm gonna raise my hand well Satan can't bother you he's talking about your soul Hallelujah he can tempt but he cannot get in other words he cannot make you cannot make you leave the faith right he cannot get a born-again Christian for God from the foundation world for Psalm and sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood speaks for him then the Bible say the blood of Jesus speaks better than that of Abel how can he sin when it can't be seen even by God the soul we're talking about the soul how can the Soul sin when it when Jesus has has filled that soul with the Holy Ghost praise God and when Jesus given a portion of his Spirit into that soul that Soul can never sin the Bible says Hallelujah the only thing he hears is your voice he sees your representation praise God beautiful so what does God want to hear today God wants to hear your voice God wants to hear my voice when we have sin or when we have any fault that separates us from God we're not to isolate ourselves and hide from God we are to go to God praise God and remember that I've got a sacrifice that sacrifice covers me that sacrifice forgives my sins and then God will hear my voice calling out through the sacrifice Hallelujah oh it's a beautiful thing amen just like Adam and Eve after they got the coats on they were crying out through their sacrifice praise God they had their sacrifice on God saw their sacrifice their coats but it was their voice praise God so it is with us it's our voice but we're clothed in Jesus's righteousness praise God Hallelujah and this is what job this is the secret job had we've gone through many times how he had all these sins he had fear he had Pride all these things but the one thing he did he continually sacrificed to God isn't that why you come to church today how many how many did that say the Bible says come to come into the house Lord with Thanksgiving we sacrifice the praise that's why we love coming to church that's why we got to come to church all the time continually thus did job continually he would sacrifice for his children praise God he would make those sacrifices now church that's what we've got to remember we're the ones who have to make sacrifices for our parents and our siblings we're the ones that's our responsibility let's not forget that so job had a revelation I'm forgiven through my sacrifice and then God I'm trusting in God to save my children through these sacrifices job couldn't do it they had their own free more agency but job's sacrifice and asked God to make a way that his children could be saved because what was going to happen very shortly they were going to die isn't that something God put it on job's heart to do all that sacrificing because they were going to be taken off the scene very soon that's what we've got to see the same that's why we got to be that's why we got to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit right we just had sister who is Dad go off the scene right for the bangs there it's Thursday see how the Holy Spirit prepares for that that service before two days before now going forward we want to be very sensitive to what the holy spirit says let's remember church thank God for the blood of Christ for our lives we thank God for that but let's remember we are Kings and Priests unto God as well where priests I think it was Karis come up for prayer on Wednesday or somebody come up for prayer in intercession and it happens often and that's a that's a beautiful thing I think we had that a few weeks ago and and when one of the children asked for intercession that's the one where the Holy Spirit I felt fell on me the the the most was interceding and what do we find job doing job was constantly praying God forgive my children if they'd done anything wrong forgive my children because he was sensitive to the Holy Spirit and they were going to leave the scene very soon a church you don't have to raise your hands but I think all of us want to be sensitive because with Souls it's between life and death once once someone is down in the in the in the Realms of Hades they don't they don't come back they don't get a chance to come back there's no passing from that place and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou to consider my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and the skeweth evil how do we know we fear God because he kept continually sacrificing to God and let's let's now I want to encourage you I want to encourage you all the time but let me encourage you you coming to church continually God sees your sacrifice God sees your sacrifice God sees you're not hiding now try to get to this a little later when we come to church we're physically here but we can't hide spiritually in other words while we're here we got to confess our sins and we got to just talk to God about it I think I'll get to that on Wednesday Lord willing by God's grace had a lot of slides for today I felt like today was his it's not some days you know I'm wondering oh Lord what am I going to say what am I going to say but see I felt like I just had a whole bunch it's like a rushing wave come in so we got leftovers for Wednesday my God's grace and then what does the Bible say let us therefore come what afraid to the throne of God but no but boldly of God that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need we can only come boldly if we know our sins are taken care of we can only come boldly if we know we have God's favor in our lives and how do we have God's favor through reconciliation through forgiveness of sin sins through continual sacrifices remember Brothers I don't often feel saved but I've got to trust God's promise that I am saved amen I've got to trust God's promise and if I confess my sins he's faithful and just to cleanse me from all unrighteousness praise God Hallelujah that's what I felt the Holy Spirit was speaking through cam last week that's why preaching on Wednesday move on if we sin confess it and move on and remember again you can come boldly that God forgives your sins quickly he quickly puts away your sins praise God now we never take Grace for granted and make a disgrace but also the same time we can't fall back into guilt and shame and unbelief you can't forget our position in Christ that's what I thought Sunday was a great reminder God is going to give us Grace when we need it the most Hallelujah and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more and where remission of these is there's no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the wholeness by the blood of Jesus church when we pray let's pray by the blood of Jesus that's the way into the holiest praise God come by our sacrifice we come clothed in our sacrifice Hallelujah in other words you got to forget what happened yesterday forget what happened last week forget what happened 10 years ago you have to forget that and you got to thank God for what's present what's present is the blood amen Hallelujah by a New and Living Way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh Jesus's body the the crucifixion of his body made the way that we can go straight to heaven praise God In Prayer to the throne of God and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart now look at that True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies wash with pure water so see the church this has to be something very personal when we confess our sins it has to be such a confession that we can come with a true heart and no Lord I'm coming to you in truth I'm not hiding anything I'm coming with everything praise God I'm not hiding anything now the sprinkling represents the anointing you receive after being forgiven that's Peter wrote about that sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ that's there's no physical blood it's spiritual it's the Holy Spirit forgiving you after you confess your sins and our bodies wash with pure water of course he's talking about the Waters of the spirit praise God the washing of Water by the word amen so see instead of hiding from God this is what God God wants us to do he wants us to confess our sins and then come to God with a A Heart full of faith remember faith is Trust Hallelujah if I asked each one of you today I come up and say you know uh we just said these prayers do you trust God heard you what would you say I hope you say yes that's trust and that means you have faith in our prayers right you're coming to God with a full Assurance of Faith how do you know why why can you have faith because you confess your sins praise God and we have a faithful high priest who's faithful to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness amen now here's what I was saying on Wednesday there's so many examples of course of writing I'm sorry hiding or running from God we already looked at Adam and Eve they ran from the presence of the Lord they hid it from the prince of the Lord the Bible said when after Moses killed this Egyptian verse 15 Exodus 2 15 but Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian so he knows the government's after him is going to arrest him as a murderer but he also knows his mom told him he's the deliverer he had a special bird he was a prophet he had all this knowledge and uh but in that moment of fear the fear isolated him from God Adam's sexual sin and Disobedience to the will of God isolated him from God so here's a different sin murder fear these sins isolate the people from God so he runs from the face of God I'm not going to ask you raise your hands but has anybody ran from God rather than running to God Hallelujah said now Moses after taking the situation in his own hands so see that's where God that's where he had the trouble he was trying to bring Deliverance by his own human efforts I just beat down one of these guys and then surely they'll see that I'm the deliverer but that was just like Birdman said one stinking dead Egyptian that's all he could accomplish on his own found out that he was a total failure I mean no without God you're a total failure that's my life verse John 15 5 I think he said without me you can do nothing none of us or anything on our own we have nothing we cannot offer God anything except just yielding to him praise God we have no ability of Our Own and brother Adam said Moses ran from both pharaoh and the prince of God look at that he runs from God's people that's the people he's supposed to deliver and he runs from his very responsibility oh but thank God he's a god of Mercy hallelujah thank God he said God has Second Chances even after 40 years amen see Church you might have been running from a problem for a year two years five years 10 15 20 25 30 35 40. let's break out that kindergarten first grade County doesn't matter how long you're running for God's Mercy is sufficient praise God think of the Mind battles on the back of the desert I'm a murderer I'm afraid of the government think of the Mind battles hiding from God and again does Moses go to God or does God go to Moses God didn't make Moses go all the way back to Egypt before he met the burning bush no the burning bush came to him church and if you're sincere and you're looking at it right God's burning bush came to you praise God you didn't go looking for God God came looking for you praise God even after murder even after abandoning God's people and abandoning the teachings of your mother and father hiding from God isolating oneself he was a stranger for 40 years way back I like this but God gave it to him God God was with him and all that praise God God orchestrated his marriage God orchestrated everything about going to Midian the sons his father-in-law God orchestrates every event of Our Lives praise God third was Jonah Jonah 1 verse 3 Jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the Lord and went down to Joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshests from the prince of the Lord he paid money to get out of the will of God Church happens all the time people will overspend on things they shouldn't spend on and then it hurts their financial condition right disobeying the word of God or paying for filthy movies or paying for our Sports tickets they're paying money for something that drives them away for God but thankfully the gospel is without money or Price amen God's never going to take your money God's never going to mistreat you God's always going to bless you praise God when we come to God and recognize that we want to be in his presence we don't want to run from God we want to run to God hallelujah so he runs from the prince of the Lord I listened to sermon yesterday beautiful message it's right before he preached on marriage and divorce and remember where Jonah went God was in the boat now look at this thought Joan is trying to run but brother Adam said God was in that boat the whole time God was in the storm God was even in the fish Hallelujah God was in that fish God prepared that fish and then God was in that fish praise God he went on being he went on being right along with Jonah until his perfect will was done that's right and the church said so when you make a mistake whether it's Financial relational job related whatever you make a mistake we might make even though we're running from God's will we know we know better than it God's still right there with us in the midst of our mistakes so God is that little voice saying you know shouldn't have done this last week and then two weeks later God's God's voice is still saying there his voice is walking to you praise God it's walking to you you should not have done that you should come back you know you need to confess this and make this right God is in all those emails you check maybe there's the email says oh you should have done this you should have done that too maybe you see a sign out there on the street that's God God it's God with you trying to show you that was wrong I know God speaks through Austin through different things like that side God's with us the whole time even though we feel separated from God which is true one way we breed him in our human Spirits like we don't have the anointing on our minds but yet God never leaves us that's amazing love that's the kind of God I want to serve praise God but in this summer brother man was preaching mostly on those who made mistakes with marriage and divorce and he said even even in mistakes like that God is still with us and then look what happened in marriage and divorce wrote around gives them he said he said the same holy spirit that met Moses and and talked through Jesus the Same holy spirit gives me permission he said stay married as you are but don't you ever do that again program brother man could have had the right by the word to separate all those marriages you could have the right to do that but God's grace gave him Grace to say stay as you are it's too late to break these things up because God don't want his children left you don't want the little children left without parents now were they going adulterers go in the Rapture I don't know about that brother said brother man said I hope so the ram said LeBron said there might be a way for you getting in now that's that's a that's great so if I ever heard it by God's grace see and if he's ever after you how many knows he's after you the Bible said if I love you I will chasten you and rebuke you in other words if I love you I'm chasing you down until you get this right praise God you might Dodge over here and Dodge over there can I just let's say brother Cameron's preaching let's say brother Cameron was preaching it and it was preaching right to your situation last week and church you know spiritually this is what we do we hide behind I'm not gonna listen about the camp he's not going to preach on me we might Dodge the sermons for a week but let's not let's let's not let it go two weeks or three weeks that's not to go two months let's not let it go this is our flesh our flesh wants to hide from God but God's grace is with us in every trial praise God and church we're going to be miserable until we come back and do the thing you started out for him to do at the first place praise God that's why I told my dad I said the way back if you left God through cigarettes and then you left God by not reading your Bible praying I said then that's exactly the way to go back get rid of your cigarettes and go back to read your Bible and pray in the closet then you'll be blessed that's the way back that's what happened to Abraham Abraham left the promised land because of a famine now look at that church he let his he let the father of Faith grow go through a famine I thought God loved Abraham he did so church when money gets a little tight on us or we don't have food or we don't have all the things that we need we don't have the nicest things in life does that mean God doesn't love us no he even let the father of Faith go through a family what about Ruth and Naomi they wouldn't even had Ruth unless that was for Naomi so the famine Naomi had to go through right that's why I was I was talking to Nia yesterday and we were talking about things I said brother I said Nia listen here I got the I got that buy right there I said brother I said let's read Romans chapter eight I took him to the place where I said where the Bible says nothing shall separate us from the love of God shall persecution shall tribulation separate you from the love of God is sword or I said like this is a AR-15 going to separates from the love of God and in that text it says famine famine cannot separate you from the will of God hallelujah from the love of God a starving person God will let Star his children starve naturally but not spiritually praise God if you let Abraham famine condition Naomi famine condition Paul said he was in hunger often church if we're going through difficult times let's not let's not be mad at god let's trust God God's doing something praise God he's building my faith he's giving me Grace he's with me in this I'm not going to run away from God I'm going to run to God hallelujah that's a good sign you are a child of God when you go through difficult times but this is what we got to be honest with are we feeling miserable spiritually are we feeling good spiritually don't don't go don't run from the presence of God face up to it you believe it's the truth if it's the truth it's worth living for dying for anything else and if he's ever Vindicated it to you that is the truth then we can't run from in nowhere he'll be right there just the same you can't do it I love that he'll be right there let's all say he'll be right there ready he'll be right there Jesus is going to be right there with you praise God ah thank God Amen if you run from Jesus he's right there with you if you run two to the Friends of God he's right there with you he's with you all the time he's going to make sure you make it praise God nothing can separate you from the love of God hallelujah let's read it while we got it so Romans 8. so everybody can thank brother cam for this message this morning you kind of preached the motivation for it Hallelujah Romans chapter 8. so I took brother Nia yesterday that's why I put him to verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ I said shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword this means God has to let his children go to the sword God has to let his children go through perils nakedness they lacking clothes famine lacking food persecution distress tribulation why because we're sheep as verse 36 and 37 says look at verse 37 though nay no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us in other words God wants you to conquer famines with his love you can conquer a famine with God's love you can conquer persecution with the love of God hallelujah oh it's beautiful for I'm persuade in verse 38 that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come see don't worry about your future because anything in your future cannot separate you from God's love Hallelujah nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and the church said go to Philippians chapter 1 verse six let's nail down some of these encouraging scriptures again not even famine concept Abraham from God's love remember Beatrice's testimonies they had to pray for food many nights did that did that do the trouble about uh having food or not or school fees did that ever separate her from God's love but in those moments God's love was manifested as they prayed as they cried out to God God's love was manifested Ephesians 1 6 Lydia I know you got it honey who started your salvation did you start it or did God start it God God came looking for you so if God started it God's going to be there the whole time and then he's going to finish it praise God and the Bible said be confident in other words let's not doubt that God is the author of my life let's not struggle with this well am I is God really a part of this or not God is a part of this praise God God's the author about it he's the author and finisher of my faith I'm confident he started this I'm confident he's with me right now he's with me now he's with me in the future and nothing can separate me from his love praise God but if we're miserable church then we got to find something to take care of that misery that's confession this is a beautiful chapter I don't have time I said if time permits to read all 18 verses I can't do that but David knew the same just like brother Rams said God was with Jonah in the fish God was with Jonah in the boat David said if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there Hallelujah see we isolate ourselves but yet I'll say like this even in our isolation God is with us because we isolate ourselves in our minds and then David a man for God's Own Heart he does adultery and then murder and then Nathan comes to him and says here no what'd he do he hid himself from God see how all these people hide themselves from God and this ain't just a common believer this is a man after God's Own Heart a message believer after God's Own Heart sometimes can hide themselves from God and Nathan said you did this secretly I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun and of course we know that happened with his son Absalom and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord so Steve now now David's get on the right Road praise God now instead of hiding from God now he's coming to God but look God had to send the prophet to him in order to bring him to correction praise God again God chose His mercy God went to Adam and Eve God took the burning bush to Moses and God brings the prophet to David hallelujah oh he's he's so rich in Mercy praise God he said I've sinned against the Lord and Nathan son of David the Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die isn't that amazing David does two of the most awful sins you could do and as soon as he says I've sinned now look at this as soon as you say church I'm sorry Lord it was my fault God puts it away from him God's just waiting for us to say those words I have sinned and remember under Old Testament law he would have he and Bathsheba should have been stoned for adultery and God said I'm gonna because you said that I'm putting it away now you're going to pay for all the consequences but you're not going to die because I put it away from me I put it out of my sight because I'm looking at the sacrifice praise God hallelujah in other words when we sin God is looking at the sacrifice of Jesus to forgive our sins Hallelujah and of course there's other consequences he lost that that David Bathsheba lost their first son brother cam was mentioning Peter a lot a man again not not just a common man a man with the keys to the kingdom on the night of his arrest Jesus said all ye shall be offended because of me this night for his written I will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad Peter twice tells Jesus no not once twice though all men should be offended because of thee yet I will never be offended I'll never be offended this message I'll stand on it I always I'll always follow you I'll die for this message you better be careful what you're saying and God's going to test that too I never struggle I've got all the faith in the world you better watch God's gonna show you don't have all faith you've got all Faith you be Jesus all Faith wouldn't make that kind of a statement that kind of a prideful statement yet I will never be offended he got offended real soon Jesus said unto him barely I said to you that this night before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice Peter said to him though I shall though I shall he doubles down on it though I should die with thee yet I will not deny thee church we I hear people say it all the time sermons I would die for this message I die for Jesus let's wait till it comes and then we'll see because anybody can say that wait to come down and look at job's example the hardest trial was his own physical health because remember the first trial was he lost all of his money and his children and then God saying goes back to God and said well you you know mano a man he'll make it as long as he's got his health he said let me touch his body and then he'll curse you and God said go ahead but that's what's the hardest battle you can fight many times a battle of your health your health when it's just you and God nobody can help you nobody can help job get better it was just him and God share some of our hardest battles but time goes on I mean you see in other churches other churches we have people that you know they we hear about them they die cancer or they're battling cancer if time goes on there's some of us are gonna have some battles I imagine I'm not prophesying anything evil I'm just I'm just looking at facts probability now I hope everybody has perfect health the rest of our life that'd be wonderful but let's be careful what we boast about Paul said I'm not going to boast in anything except the Cross of Christ amen he said I'm boasting nothing saving the Cross of Christ my Lord amen Peter's boast and said I got the keys guys I'll never you can never offend me I've got faith I'll die for this message and then when I come push come to shove he didn't die for the message right there later on he did but not right there in that same hour said Jesus now the multitude surrounding him Peter's already cut off the malchus's ear servant's ear Jesus put the ear back on and Jesus says are you come out as against a thief with swords and saves for to take me I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me but all this was done that the scriptures the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled so just a few hours later Peter runs Peter hides from Jesus yet he'd said all along I'm going to stand with you I'm just I'm faithful I've got all the faith in the world wait till your health and freedom come into question the church in America we have health we have freedom we have all these great things but I hope you understand the greatest tests are the ones where they just like job you lose your family you lose your health you lose all your money and in those moments will you say what job said blessed to be the name of the Lord he gives and takes away praise God so Pete not just Peter all the disciples hide from Jesus why was it wasn't it to show that we would all run from Christ so we all need forgiveness all of us do so sexual sin isolated Adam fear isolated Moses sexual sin and murder isolated David Jonah's anger because remember Jonah was angry about his Gore and God was saying that's the anger you have against Nineveh anger will isolate someone from God you'll run you'll pay money to get out of God's presence you'll do anything to get out of God's presence and God's saying don't run from me come to me the whole time and that's your lead and as you're going as we run from God's presence some of us when we run from God's presence God's with us whole time saying come back come back come back you can come back there's there's Grace there's Mercy and of course Church all of our sin isolates us from God all of our sin this is a beautiful chapter was this a Psalm of David was this I forgot to check on that psalm 32. yes the psalm of David praise God oh and this is connected to David Bathsheba now this in church I acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid we have we have to be completely honest with God we cannot hide anything from God I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin for this shall every one that is Godly how many godly people we got here today this is how everyone that's Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him and look at here see instead of hiding our in our sins the Bible says Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance Salah so we don't hide away in our sins we don't let our sins cause us to separate ourselves from others but we're to go to Christ and find a hiding place in Jesus's love praise God and this is what everyone does that is Godly Hallelujah many Sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord Mercy shall Compass him about me thank God for your guardian angel praise God the Hedge how many thank you Over the Hedge about you praise God see Mercy compasses you about and this is how the chapter ends and church maybe I'll look at this on Wednesday but I want to go through some of the Psalms of David and David makes all these complaints to God but in almost every situation he ends it by giving God praise so I look at that when we when we are isolated or when we isolate ourselves just tell God all the honest truth tell God what you feel of course say it with respect don't make vows you can't keep but God's not afraid of what you're going through that's why the that's why the book of Psalms was given to us so that we in our trials could see this is what David faced this is the trial he faced way harder than what I go through when was the last time you had a bounty hunter who was the president United States hunting you down right has FBI ever knocked down your door to hunt you down and kill you so they the these expressions of crying out to God God where are you Lord I need you they always end with but I will be glad in the Lord and rejoice he says ye righteous shout for Joy all ye that are upright in heart Hallelujah so brother Ram ends this sermon a man running from the presence of God if you haven't listened to it lately he ends the sermon by saying we must face up to our responsibilities especially when it comes to sins but even as I said ministers they'll come face to face with truth and then walk away from us see there seems like there is something sometimes that they don't want to face up to him many times have people come and say I know that's right brother Brandon but if I did that they'd kick me out of your church what of it if you don't they're going to kick you out up there they're going to kick you out of heaven you're gonna get kicked out somewhere praise God might as well get kicked out here right from denominations come to the truth and then they'll accept you in heaven praise God so you got to be kicked out somewhere so you might as well face up to it instead of running from it say well I'll go over here I won't go back go back sure listen to some more of it search the scriptures Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me but we find that people won't face up with that being brought into the presence of God and see when God made a promise God is obligated to that promise and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour we find that everywhere church that's why there's so many Cults and evil things around the message because message breachers they've heard the word and they haven't preached it they haven't faced up to it right and then they've made false doctrines right and then once they make one false Doctrine it spreads to another false Doctrine and pretty soon sin is allowed sins allowed us to go on think about that the Corinthian Church had a man that was sleeping with his stepmom and nobody mourned over it see church that's what we need if we know there's sin in the church we've got to mourn over it praise God and that was what we would call a book of Acts church or that would be one of those original churches Paul started see it's a responsibility if we know the word we got to keep the word Hallelujah we can't run from it we got to keep the word of God and then and when you see this in this day now when the word of God has made these promises of things that we see happening now then we've got the responsibility to either face up to it or get away from it you can't just stay neutral you've got to do something about it some move has got to be made you can't come in that church door and go out the same person you come in you're either further away or closer to God every time you come in and go out there oh see how easy it is look it's not hard for people to shirk the responsibility it's easy it's easy not to do what's right it's hard to do what's right because it goes against your flesh goes against your mind your thinking now let me just use an example for last Sunday we heard the energized word now I'm not going to ask for hands but which of us this week said I'm going to take that word and I'm gonna let that word energize a part of my life I hope I hope all the hands will go up but if we didn't look what happened we just heard the word and it wasn't mixed with faith that's why with each service with each day with each time We Gather we got to take something away from that and apply it directly to our lives what does James 1 say we can't just be hearers only we got to be doers of the word of God Hallelujah by God's grace hold on to one thing do that right and do it tomorrow praise God it's easy to just come to church and go through the motions it's hard to let God energize your faith every single day praise God Hallelujah I was just went through those five examples to bring you I want to go through those bad examples to bring you to the example who never failed Jesus never hid from God brother Brandon said he faced up and he took the right path Jesus stood there what man would be poor didn't have a place to lay his head that even knowed where a fish swallowed a coin who what man could take them big jugs of water turn them into wine and not have a place to lay his head look at that didn't even have enough he had to face up the responsibilities that had been given into his hand what man that could Raise A Man Out of a grave after he had been dead four days of rotten he could not could he not have saved himself sure he could but if he did he'd not say he would not have saved us he had to face up to the responsibilities and because of his Disobedience to the word I'm sorry because of his obedience to the word sorry where is Adam's Disobedience and he had took the shortcut So Adam took the shortcut the way down to tarshus but Jesus Took the straightway to Nineveh to the Gentiles to get himself abroad that's a beautiful type wow Damon see that's right now Hallelujah I'm glad he did it tonight and we ought to face up to the facts that we belong to him and take the world away praise God and the church said Don't Take The Wrong route away from obeying the word of God obey the word of God that's the route we need to take praise God the way of disobedience is always going to be harder it's always going to have more suffering so he's going to have more trouble in it the way of obedience is the right way praise God it's the ship to Nineveh can we say it like obedience is taking the first shift to Nineveh praise God obedience is hearing taking the first sermon or the first time you read that in your Bible and obeying that the first time that's taking the shift in Innova praise God Hallelujah this is what cam mentioned Kim mention Elisha had to keep his eyes on Elijah for the double portion Jesus had to keep his eyes on Calvary to pour out the portion of his holy ghost on the day of Pentecost the Bible said when it was time the time had come he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem that's what we need to do today we need to see what is what time is it right now what does God want me to do in my life right now what time is it and help me to find out help me to know that and then help me to obey God's word in this time of my life it came time to go to the Cross so he set his face there nothing could stop him is it time that we obey something is it a time that we make something right it's a time that we finally do what God's called us to do praise God it's when Jesus was faced with this crucifixion the night of his arrest what do you do instead of running from God instead of running out in the wilderness he went to Gethsemane it means the oil press so he was going to go through all the pressure prayer the power of prayer was going to bring out the will of God in his life prayer going to God In Prayer is going to allow the perfect will of God to be done in your life going to God In Prayer Hallelujah he says sit ye here while I go Yonder and pray he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then he said unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death Terry ye here and watch with me and he said to his disciples weary they've had lots of big meetings was tired perhaps like you this you know this morning you don't raise your hand but anybody tired this morning long work week he was tired perhaps like you are this morning but he said will you just watch with me an hour where I've got to go Yonder and have a conference I have to go alone and then the conference was set and the lamb young a beautiful life never a life like that never was never will be a life like that the lamb had but the father said to Jesus in Gethsemane are you willing is your love for your brethren great enough is your love for that sinful stinking world that you were born in do you love them enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to take their place to Bear their sins to the hardest crucial death he said there could be nothing die that could that kind of death but him in that conference such a decision was made until blood dropped from his brow he was under a strain the sins of the world was upon him and he looked into the face of the dove and said not my will but thy will be done look at that he said his face towards seeking God he could have ran from it Hallelujah but he didn't run from it praise God church we all run from it at times but when we feel the beckoning of the Holy Spirit we got to face up to what God's calling us to do and it's got a it's got to line up with this word right here and the church said if God's calling you to do something it'll be right here in this word praise God it won't be outside in this word it'll be right here in the word of God 's asking us to face up to it and look and look the word of God in the face and say Yes Lord I'll do your will not my will that's taking the ship to Nineveh praise God he said oh can we have that decision in your hearts this morning can you forfeit that little filthy life of yours what can I say a little filthy habit are you willing to look into his face and say not my will I'm a druckard but I'll drink no more I'm a gambler but I'll gamble no more I'm gonna have in there I'm immoral but I'll be that way no more I'm a liar but I'll stop it today I'm a foul person but in this conference in this service this morning I look into Jesus face and take my master who died for me to make my way clear not my will but your will if it cost me my home it would cost me my husband my wife my father my mother my fellowship my church membership whatever it costs me in this conference this morning I say I want your Holy Spirit to live in me praise God I've heard about it I want you and me not mine yours that's my decision God has called a place not upon some high Pinnacle place but a humble little Tabernacle about to Fallen we're having a conference how many know we're having a conference this morning praise God Hallelujah he wants to meet each one of us and again just reiterating the scripture how does he want us to come he wants us to draw near to God he doesn't God doesn't want us to run he doesn't want us to hide he wants us to come near to him having a True Heart full Assurance of faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water Hallelujah I'm going to skip past that yeah I was been listening to The Sixth Seal this week as well a little bit off and on the church there's gonna be nobody that can hide from Jesus think about it millionaires billionaires trillionaires I don't know if there's such a thing as true in there they're spending their whole life now running from Christ Ronnie the word of God says this and we have the opportunity we're the we're the Blessed ones to hear the word of God Hallelujah hear the message of the hour the revelations restored the church back to its rightful place and sometimes we struggle with hiding from God and sermons like this are to encourage us and to teach us to teach us to come to God every time not hide from God not not try to just put it off for another week or put it off or just try to forget about it whatever we may be battling we got to come to God we got to face up to what responsibility God's given to us no one can hide from Jesus under the Sixth Seal the kings are there so let's just name some Kings what's the Saudi characters nobody remember him what's the North Korea Kim Kim Jong-un what's the North Korea guy Vladimir Putin let's put some names in there Joe Biden the kings of the Earth the Great Men the rich man Elon Musk will put them in there Bill Gates Chief captains if it happens in our day all the Mighty Men every slave every free man hid themselves in the Rock in the dens in the rocks of the mountains now I hear about it on on I hear about it from people that you know rich people are actually building themselves bunkers underground I don't know if that's true but look what the Bible says the Bible says they'll want to do it they will spend hours and and years digging holes in the rocks to try to get away from Jesus why don't they just come to Jesus but they want to enjoy their their sins they'll do everything they can to hide from the face of Jesus and yet Jesus Jesus invites everyone to him and they actually say to the mountains and rocks they're actually crying out to Nature fall on us let me be buried in rocks let me be buried under mountains so I don't have to look in Jesus face they're asking to be buried alive so they don't have to look in this word and say you know what this is right and I'm wrong this is right I'm the one who sinned against this I've got I want to be right I want to do what this says they will say mountains and they'll say walls follow me let this whole building follow me so I don't have to face this but Church we've got to face it praise God we've got to face the word of God and do what the word of God says fall on us hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the Wrath of the Lamb the six seal proves nobody can hide from Jesus when the day of Wrath comes Jesus comes and the Bible said every eye will see him let's come to him in Mercy right now he promises Mercy to all them that come praise God I'm going to look at this more on Sunday but or Wednesday I want to buy our musicians to come here Proverbs 24 let's say nor feet Proverbs 24 verse 15. maybe I'll start with this on Wednesday lay not wait o Wicked Man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place for a just man Fallen seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into Hallelujah I got one too so maybe we can sing yours first we might have the same song Hallelujah first I preached all that to encourage us that in the times we isolate ourselves God's still with us even when we isolate ourselves we don't want to talk about it we don't want to hear nothing about it we want to feel sorry for ourselves we want to complain we want to ignore obvious things that we need to take care of God is still with us in those moments and as you know it's natural to fall into mistakes that's what Humanity does Adam and Eve just naturally fell into it I'm reminded too where Jesus Peter said Lord how many times do I forgive my brother one day if my brother sins against me seven times should I forgive him he said no he said 70 times that that means Jesus said a man could fall 490 times and be forgiven in one day the Bible says here even a just man even a righteous man we're going to fall into mistakes but the Bible says we've got to rise again not to rise again I'm talking about whatever situation that we have ignored or not taken care of we've got to take care of that situation it's got to be brought under the blood of Jesus
