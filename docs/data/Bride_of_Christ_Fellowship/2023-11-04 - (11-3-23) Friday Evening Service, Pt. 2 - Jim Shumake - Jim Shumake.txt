about to see Victory amen what's going to happen he said that woman started playing that special and that woman started beating the washboard and a little blond-headed girl jumped out on the floor and she began to dance in the spirit he said and I'm sitting there my whole congregation is looking at me you can't see what he said but I said I can just a picture him they're all going what are you going do about that brother Jesse what are you g to do about that huh that guy's up there doing this that what are you going to do about that just the Lord will take care of it you just just watch amen he said what what are you going to do about that amen he says sit there Danae he said the little girl jumped down the floor started dancing Spirit me sitting there in the seat of the scornful yes he said now I wish you'd look at that he said I've been telling my whole church till they was all looking at me wondering what I was going to do about it and he said I kept looking at her and I thought look at that now if that ain't something if that ain't something amen not look at that if that ain't something if that ain't something there's two ways of look at us calling something something if that ain't something disgusting no if that ain't something marvelous if that ain't something amen I thought look at that if that ain't something making a cavern out of my church amen why would he Rec why would he relate it to a Tavern you know I always do that in my mind why why would he relate it to a Tavern have you ever I pray that none of you have ever been in a Tavern I wish I could say I've never been in a Tavern but thank God I got the victory over the tavern but I've been in the tavern and I've seen men get drunk I've seen men get drunk to where they didn't care how they acted I've seen men that wouldn't say ouch when they were in pain and they stand up on the table and sing God Bless America they'd be so drunk amen they wouldn't know what they were doing amen making a Tavern out of my church what was she doing she was unashamedly standing out there dancing amen in that place that's why he related it to a Tavern am Glory you get drunk in the spirit you'll act the same [Applause] way amen and I was sitting there not knowing any better I wasn't saying it but I was thinking it all in my heart yes and as I watched her I said I wonder if a ladies got any scripture for this right there on the side of my paper said that's what brought this sermon to light amen because I was told you don't have any scripture for that and I said I got tons of scripture for this I don't have any scripture for yours but I got lots of scripture for this oh I'm glad you asked let me show you I don't have any Scripture but there's a lot of scripture in here amen I don't have any word but there's a lot of word in there man I wonder if there's any scripture for this and I began to think where would somebody ever act like this in the Bible and we all know where it was amen he said then I seen the children of Israel when they crossed the Red Sea I see Miriam look back and see those taskmasters drowned she picked up the tambourine and she began to dance and beat the tambourine and run up and down the shores with the daughters of Israel fer dancing shouting the victory she saw the enemy destroyed behind her she saw the enemy destroyed behind her last night we look we look Amen in Samuel's day when the when the children of Israel saw their enemy defeated by the Lord God Almighty they saw their enemy destroyed amen and he said hither too God has brought you and

no worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy servants and he arose and he came to his father what is this is a repentant heart in that Son of God Amen this is the same heart that that Samuel told those people last night they had to have he said you turn from living your way you turned from your ideas you turn from following your Gods amen you turn from doing all that he said and serve me only he says then I'll forgive your sins Hallelujah did he do it amen did he deliver him from the enemy yeah he'll do it for you tonight too that's the heart that this prodal had tonight he said he

exactly what I was when I was yet a sinner amen amen believe this Romans Romans 5'8 says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us when while I was yet a great way off before I ever come back before I ever gave my heart to the Lord he saw me and he sent his only begotten son to bleed and die for me amen well I was yet awake far off amen the father interceded for me he says here while the father well the father saw him amen and he had compassion on him that God loved us the same way for God to loved us he said his son he had compassion on us that he shed his blood for us amen he ran and fell on on his neck and he kissed him and the son said to him father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight I am no more worthy to be called thy son amen he repented of his sin amen and I

might have in your life I pray to God that none of us have it amen but I don't care what it is amen my Bible tells me you get this Spirit In Your Heart Right Here my Bible tells me in 1 John 1:9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and cleanse us from all unright everybody say all all all unrighteousness amen he came he confessed his sin he pleaded before the father and God took all his sins away amen hallelujah he didn't say okay you just bring back the money and then I'll make you a son he always was a son he was forgiven why because the said father said to his
