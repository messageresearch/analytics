TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Thank you musicians. Appreciate that. How many were excited to come to church today? Praise God. Amen. Seems like it all these days go so slow. We can't wait till it's Sunday. Can't wait till it's Wednesday to be back in the house of the Lord. Hallelujah. That's how I feel. I think every Holy Ghost fil believer feels that way. Don't you? Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. 1 Corinthians chapter 15. Uh we're going to keep working through this book here. We're almost done. Got two more chapters. We preached all the way through it. And like I said, then I can say what uh Paul said or I can say what brother Brandham said. I preach what Paul preached. Hallelujah. That's what we want to do. We want to preach what Paul preached. For Paul's words will judge us on that day. Whether judged innocent or judged guilty, we want to be innocent by the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. We have a visitor today. Brother, what's your name? &gt;&gt; Greg. Let's give Greg a round of applause. God bless you, brother Greg. Hallelujah. Thank you, Chris, for inviting Greg by God's grace. Well, hope you feel at home here, brother. By God's grace, we just want to worship Jesus. We want the Holy Ghost to flow through our lives. Hallelujah. God bless you, brother. 1 Corinthians chapter 15. I think we'll just read verses one and two uh to kind of preserve time. We just have one service today. I want to give everybody a break. You know, we've had a lot of wonderful services. and then remind everybody next Sunday we have two services. My brother Cameron will be here, brother Cam will be preaching. It's been a while since we had him, but uh you know with him pastoring, I don't invite him very often, just like he does invite me very often because we both got a pastor. But I thought, well, at least once a year I can get him over here. All right, out of 52 weeks, surely I can get one of those by God's grace. And that's kind of how he treats me as well, which is very sweet. So, we look forward to seeing what God has placed on brother Cam's heart. Just come expecting next week. Hallelujah. You should have came expecting today. Hallelujah. If not, let's let's get that attitude of expectation. Praise God. Because uh God can only do for us what we believe he can do. Hallelujah. Faith comes by hearing. Got to have faith. Hallelujah. 1 Corinthians 15. We'll read verses 1 and two. Uh then we'll have you be seated here by God's grace. Could you put up one and two hun? Maybe we can read those together there. Thank you, sweetheart. Appreciate that. Hallelujah. Let's read this on three. Ready? One, two, three. Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand, by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. May God add the blessing to the ring of his word. You can be seated. Okay. So, I have some uh quotes here and some scriptures here. We'll read uh show by God's grace. We're in part 27 here. We're almost finishing up. It's good to almost see the finish line. I've I went back through my notes. I have a thousand slides just on this book already as far as that's how many scriptures I've showed you, how many quotes I've showed you. So, I feel good about that. It's nice to go back and review and kind of see where we started and see where we are. by God's grace. We started this series back in October of uh 2024. Now, we're we're getting down. Now, we're in the eighth part here by God's grace. Now, we're in Paul's instructions about resurrections. We just finished up with uh tongues on Wednesday night. So, if you didn't hear that, you'd like to hear about tongues and um their place in the body of Christ, you could listen to that one on uh Wednesday from last Wednesday uh by God's grace. So, uh, we believe tongues are real. Hallelujah. Uh, we do not believe they're the sign of the Holy Ghost. They're just a sign that the Holy Ghost has anointed you to do a gift. Hallelujah. Just like if someone had a gift to give a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge. It's just a sign that God's anointed you with the gift. But every believer has a gift. Even unbelievers have a gift. Like Judas and like Balum, right? And like Kora, even all of them had gifts. Uh but you can have the gift without having the giver of the gift. We want to have Jesus Christ. He's the giver of the gift. That's what we were singing about earlier, the Holy Ghost. God has given us the victory through the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. So, it's been great to go through this book. Uh very refreshing. And uh remember, you know, we we've seen uh some of their sins. You know, this church needed the love of God to overcome all their sins. There was divisions about who is the right pre the best preacher. There was sexual sin in the church which was so wicked a man was sleeping with his stepmother. Uh so wicked the Bible said even heathens wouldn't do something like that. Uh and yet Paul never disavows this church. He he he believed in grace. He believe believed in forgiveness. He believed in correction too. &gt;&gt; Uh they were suing each other. They were getting drunk at the Lord's table and the rich weren't eating with the poor. Uh and there were just too many spiritual gifts going on. Paul said you got to give two just two or three. Don't give a hund uh many many gifts. Brother Chris, you have a question. Uh the rich were not they were refusing the poor to eat with them. So that's in that's okay. That's in first uh Corinthians 11. The Bible said when they would have communion, they said the rich would bring their food and eat it right outside uh the church, but they wouldn't let the poor people eat with them. And then they were even getting drunk, right? So before communion they were getting drunk and so Paul said those things not should not be. The Bible said if you get drunk then you will not inherit the kingdom of God. Drunkards do not inherit the kingdom of God. So great question. Let's give him to class brother. Great question. I like to give a encouragement there. Great question brother. Now we haven't seen yet where they lacked uh generosity. Paul said you didn't even send me any gifts when I was struggling and yet his love extends to them. So church you're going to find that in your life just like Paul said. Paul said, "The more that I love people, the less I'm loved." And I bring that up from time to time just to remind you, don't expect that people are just going to love you more and more. Remember the prophecy for the end time is that Jesus said, "Because iniquity shall bound, what shall wax cold?" The &gt;&gt; the love of many. So expect, you got to keep your love hot while other people just cool off. &gt;&gt; That's what you got to expect. So just keep showing the love of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're at a time where it's the most deceptive time that's ever been. We're at a time where there's the mo I'm sorry, the least Christian love of all time. But yet, we have the full revelation at the end time as well. The Bible said, "I'll restore all things." So everything's been restored at the end time. So as long as the word's restored, we can be victors. Hallelujah. But this church lacked generosity. They were the They were huge church, big church, lots of tongues, lots of gifts, lots of prophecy, but they were stingy with their money. And then as we'll see in the next book, they brought in all these false preachers. So the pastors weren't very good. They were letting false preachers come in preaching false things. Um I'll try to do better. I try to do better than that by God's grace. Hallelujah. I'll say like this. You know, think about this church. We don't have I don't hear anybody arguing in here about who's the greatest preacher. I've never heard that here. As far as I know, there's no sexual immorality here. As far as I know, no one is suing anybody know here. I know that's true because we'd know it if somebody was suing somebody, right? No one's getting drunk here. I've never seen anybody drunk except on the Holy Ghost. And that's good. Uh I've never seen the rich, the more rich here uh not fellowship with the poor here. I've never seen that. And we've never had gifts out of order. And I found this to be a very generous church. And we don't allow false preachers in here. Hallelujah. So church, what can we say? Like brother Brandham said, we're a mature church by God's grace. Now, do we see immaturities in some areas? Yes. No one's perfect, &gt;&gt; but look, look, look, look how far God has brought us. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen. &gt;&gt; Look how far." And Paul still calls them in 2 Corinthians 11, he still said, "You when you heard the gospel, you were a chasteed virgin." So in God's eyes, no matter even their struggles, God knew God knew he would correct them and help them to overcome all these sins and then they would be a virgin church, a pure ch, I'm sorry, a pure church, unspotted by the world. &gt;&gt; In other words, there's hope. Even if your church has all these awful situations, there's hope that the blood of Jesus Christ will help you to overcome these sins. Repent of these sins, and then you'll be pure in God's sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you will not be guilty anymore of these sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I just want to review, you know, uh some I went back and looked at my first sermon on this series, you know, in part one. This is part 27. And just remember that God's prophet, Brother Brandham, in uh his his ministry, he would preach through entire books of the Bible. So, I just want to let you know, brother preached the entire book of Job uh half of the book of Hebrews and the entire book of Revelations uh to his church. And I thought you might like this one. He said he preached the book of Job. It took him about a year and a half to get through it. When I got him over on the ash heap, I kept telling there I kept him there for about six or eight weeks. And one of the members, she didn't want to hurt my feelings, but she wrote me a letter saying, "Brother Brandon, when are you ever going to get Job off the ash heap?" Now, can you imagine if I preached six weeks on Job on the ash heap? Six weeks. I'll take maybe two services on that. And then you might be thinking, man, when is he ever going to move on to something else? But look, you know, the Holy Spirit had him deal with that because there must have been some people on some ash heaps. And so, they needed to know, they need to know really well that even when you're on the ash heap, God's going to bring you out of that ash heap. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he preached on uh the send sermons on Hebrews chapters 1-7. I like this one. Uh brother Ram said he would start in the book of Genesis and tie the Bible together and start in Exodus with it and run the book of Daniel and maybe the book of Revelation. Just take the entire book from place to place because all of God's word is inspired. Hallelujah. And then he say uh he says in my home church once I took almost a year and a half to go through the book of revelations slowly each night teaching on just the book of revelations and comparing it with the rest of the Bible and the ages and so forth that have passed on. Hallelujah. Now remember um with a pastoral gift a pastor is supposed to take you through the books of the Bible. Brother Graham tells us this. He said, "An evangelist can't do that because he's only here one or two or three or four or five services. He can't take you through a whole book of the Bible, but a pastor can." And you know, we thank God for pastors. We thank God for evangelists. I thank God for all the five preaching gifts. &gt;&gt; We need all of them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But brother tells us in adoption in 1960, he preached four sermons on adoption. And uh I'm not going to go through all this, but brother Bam said, "You repeat after me." He said, "Placing." And the congregation said, "Placing the body." the body of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ positionally positionally in Christ in Christ where the Holy Spirit where the Holy Spirit is leading us is leading us. He said, "There you are. You got it." So he just had the church rehearse after him. That we're placed in the body of Jesus Christ positionally where the Holy Spirit is leading us. So my question is, where is the Holy Spirit leading you in the body of Christ? I know where he's leading me. Where is he leading you? That's a good question to ask &gt;&gt; because you want to let you want to follow the Holy Spirit to where he wants you to be in the body of Christ. So what are you are you going to have a preaching gift? Now we know not the sisters but the brothers. Is he leading you there into song ministry, fasting ministry, prayer ministry, outreach ministry? Uh what is he leading you to do in the body of Christ? A wisdom ministry, knowledge ministry, tongues interpretation ministry, prophecy ministry. Sisters, what gifts has God given you? What ministry is he leading you in? So that you're in your position when Jesus Christ comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said when Jesus comes, every soldier will be in his or her rank and they won't they won't break rank. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was in the book of Joel and Daniel both say that you have to be in your position and you can't step out of your position. You got to stay in your position. &gt;&gt; So let's find our positions. Hallelujah. I don't know when that will happen, but I'll say like this. If you set your face to finding your position, God will show it to you. &gt;&gt; How did I do it? Uh I waited on the Lord, right, for preaching. I waited on it for a while, over a year. And then they kept asking me, I said, "Let me pray. Let me wait till the right time. I got time to pray. I had to finish my football career at the University of Akan. I had to finish that. And then after that, now now I have time to pray. Now I have time to seek God." Right? And then through that, through seeking God, God gave me vindications. And now I'm in my position. So you've got to do the same. You got to make time. You got to set aside time to spend with Jesus so that he can show you the gifts in your life. Vindicate them to you so that then you can do your ministry he's called you to do &gt;&gt; because you need proof. You need vindication that God's called you to do what you're doing. &gt;&gt; And that vindication is fruits. You'll have fruits to your ministry. Brother Ram says you'll know what God wants you to do. You'll be able to do what God wants you to do. &gt;&gt; How do I know I got a gift to prophesy? Because you prophesy. How do you know you got a gift of of faith? Because you speak words of faith and it comes to pass. Hallelujah. How do you know you can preach? Because you can preach by the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. How do you know you're a song leader? Because you can lead songs and the people enjoy the worship. Hallelujah. Amen. I hope that's helpful by God's grace. And I'm I'm not even getting to where I'm supposed to go. And he said, "Watch this master teacher, St. Paul. The first thing he does is knock out all the ideas of falling away." So if you're struggling with falling away, go read Ephesians chapter 1 &gt;&gt; because this is what brother Ram's saying. The brother brother Ram said the Bible tells us that the the Bible says you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. So how you going to fall away if God chose you before the foundation of the world? &gt;&gt; He chose you before you got here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That means you're always going to be his choice. No matter what happens here, he already chose you back there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So just knock that just knocks it all out of your mind. I'm not going to fall away. Jesus chose me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Knock out all the idea of ever be a Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone and the next day God condemned me and the next day I'm back again. That's nonsense. &gt;&gt; In other words, God's not condemning you today. He didn't condemn you yesterday. He's not going to condemn you tomorrow. You're saved today. You'll be saved tomorrow. You'll always be saved. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because of God's promise. Hallelujah. You met God's conditions. And when you meet God's conditions, God backs up those conditions and God vindicates that you met the conditions. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's nonsense." This book is not addressed to evangelistic teaching. Sorry. Is that me? Is that me? Was that me? Okay. I'm sorry. Maybe I'm moving too much. I don't want to move too much. This book is not addressed to evangelistic teaching. Evangelist sermons. I don't touch this on the field. So brother said, "I would not preach Ephesians 1, the whole chapter, while out preaching at other churches." He would only preach it at his church. Why, brother Brandham? Because I bring this to the church. For Paul addressed it to the saints, those that are called, preserved, and filled, and set aside, and are in the Holy Spirit. They're already in Canaan's land. So church, everybody here should be either in Canaan's land or close to Canaan's land &gt;&gt; in evangelical services. Brother Ram had a lot of sinners in there. They weren't even out of Egypt yet. &gt;&gt; But you're out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; So you're either out of Egypt in the wilderness or you're in the promised land or maybe at the you're maybe at your at the banks of Jordan today and you're waiting for the waters to cross and be born again. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Either way, we're not in Egypt, right? So, we need a word that's for the believer who's in the promised land, for the believer who's already a saint, who's already separated unto God. And that's what pastoral ministry does. It takes you through the word of God that is given to the saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, in other words, just just this might be helpful. The first thing, church, is get it out of your mind that you're going to get lost. Get it out of your mind today. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be lost. I'm going to be saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And don't be scared of this and don't be scared of that. Don't be scared of nothing. For he's trying to tell you where you're at, who you are, and how you're standing. &gt;&gt; Let's read that real quick since we are there. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 1. We might as well. I spent enough time on it already there. Ephesians 1 verse one. Remember, this is not for evangelical teaching. This is for pastoral teaching. Let's see if somebody feels better after reading this here. By God's grace, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. So listen, you're not at Ephesus, but you are the faithful in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil might say, "Oh, this was written for the Ephesus." Well, it was, but Paul also said for the faithful. &gt;&gt; That's you and I. Amen. Hallelujah. Grace be unto you, not judgment, not legalism. Grace, not condemnation. Grace is to you &gt;&gt; and peace from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. You get grace and peace from God and his son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Church, you should say it today. Say, I am blessed. Ready? I am blessed. You have you have every spiritual blessing you have need of. You just got to remember that you got it. You got to accept it. You got to believe it. And you got to thank God for it. &gt;&gt; You have You and I have everything we need. There's not something that we're lacking. If we're lacking to it, we just got to confess our sins or or drop what we're hanging on to and accept and receive what God has given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you came in empty today or if you came in with a burden, lay that burden down and grab onto the promise of God. &gt;&gt; I'm chosen in Christ. I'm already seated in the heavenly places. THERE'S ALREADY A THEOPHONY body waiting for me in heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I leave this house, this body, when I leave this house, I go to another eternal house. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I'm absent from this body, then I'm present with the Lord. &gt;&gt; And now verse four, one of my most favorite verses. Well, it's hard to say. They're all my favorite, but sometimes it feels like my most favorite verse in the whole Bible. According as he hath chosen us. Where did he choose us? In him. Before. When did he choose us? Before the foundation of the world. So before this this earth was, I already was. &gt;&gt; Before this world, before the United States came along, I was already chosen in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before anything, before all this, we were already chosen in Christ. God knew us back then. If God knew us back then, then God knows us now. And God will know us for all eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That how that how how should we live, church, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated that means predetermined us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. So God predetermined that we'd come to the earth as sinners and then we'd recognize that he was our father and he would we were out of his family when we were sinners, but then he would bring us into the family, adopt us and give us a home and a future and resources and every spiritual blessing in the family of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I preached on adoption at the middle school a couple weeks ago and it was just awesome to see. Uh there was two or three middle schoolers that were uh adopted and I was like, "What was your life before the adoption?" Oh, it was awful. We were poor. I didn't have this. I I said, "Well, what was your life after the adoption?" "I got everything I need." &gt;&gt; I've got a mom. I've got a dad who cares for me. &gt;&gt; Now I'm taken to church because I'm adopted. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I said, I said, "Uh, can you just go in the fridge and get whatever you want?" He said, "Yeah, as long as it's not sugary, I can go do that, too." In other words, you got a you got a license. You you got the right to go all throughout the house. It's yours. You're part of the family. You're not somebody outside the family. You have a new family. YOU'RE IN GOD'S family now. &gt;&gt; You have the rights and responsibilities of a child of God. You're adopted. And it was predetermined that God was going to do it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world. Well, I could have stopped right there and we would already have a great time in the Lord, right? But Abraham said there's enough right in there. He said evangelist evangelists can't do that. This is for the people that are in the body of Christ. This is for people that are living in Canaan's land. Amen. That's the kind of preaching we need to hear that all spiritual blessings, we have them. We're already seen in heavenly places. We're a part of the family of God. THIS WAS ALL SET UP by God. And we're just walking in God's beautiful plan for our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just got to Earth mercy and we realized that we're part of a bigger plan than what we thought. &gt;&gt; We thought it was just a, you know, living our uh our family, but we realized, wow, I'm part of a greater family than just my natural family. I'm a part of the heavenly eternal family &gt;&gt; with Moses and Enoch. Hallelujah. And Joshua and all the saints down through the ages. I'm in the family of God. And Jesus is my king. Jesus is my Lord. Hallelujah. Well, if I ever get to Corinthians, it might might be now here by God's grace. Now, this this is quite a chapter. This is over this is 58 verses long. So, I'm not going to get through all that today. I'm not going to preach three hours today. I feel like it sometimes, but I'm not going to do that today. Um, I want to just get through the first 11 verses if I can here uh by God's grace. But this is a tremendous chapter. He first talks about Christ's resurrection and the importance of that. And then he deals with uh the resurrection of the dead. And then he deals with the exact body that you'll have in the resurrection. And then he deals with the body change from the terrestrial body or the physical body into the glorified body. And then he ends with the victory. That's why we sang about victory today. I had victory on my heart and mind as I'm studying here by God's grace. Now there's at least three reasons he wrote this chapter. He wanted to promote faithfulness. So church, be faithful to God. &gt;&gt; Satan's always going to battle you on that. Are you faithful enough and try to make you discouraged, try to get you out of good habits, try to get you into bad habits. But this chapter was written so we would be faithful. And the way to be faithful is to remember what you're called to do, right? Think about at your job. What's what's the only way you could get fired at the job? Is if you forget to do what you're supposed to do. You forgot. Well, like brother Chris, I forgot to deliver the package, you know, right? I forgot to put it maybe by the uh the garage or I forgot to take a picture of it. That's the only way. What's that? Yeah, that's the only way you'll fail, right? Is if you don't remember what you're supposed to do. And that's the same for a Christian. The Christian just has to remember what am I here for? What is God's call for my life? What does God want out of my life? I I knew it at one time. Satan's trying to get me to forget about it. He's trying to get my mind off other things, but I've got the peace of God. &gt;&gt; Or I'll say like this, I'm going to get back the peace of God. I'm going to get back a piece of mind so I remember what he's called me to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because remember Paul writes this to make sure the saved, you're going to keep saved because people can lose their salvation whether they recognize the Bible or not. There's twice the God says in the Old Testament, Exodus 32, God told Moses, "I'll blot them out for their sins." And Moses says, "No, blot me out." And God said, "No, I'm not going to blot you out. I'm going to blot out anyone who sins against me." Right? And then Jesus says in Revelation chapter 3, I believe it's verse 5, he says, "If you do not overcome, I will blot your name out of the book of life." So people can lose their salvation because salvation is a gift. Just like you can get a birthday gift and then you can lose it, right? Or you got a birthday gift or you got a Christmas gift and you say, "I don't want this. This is just a cheap gift. I don't want this gift." And you reject you reject the gift. And it might be a great gift, but you just think it's cheap. That's how salvation is. Some people think it's something worthless. Salvation is the greatest gift you could ever receive. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul says you're saved if you keep in memory. That's why keeping your mind right is so important. Because if you forget what the gospel is all about, if you forget why you're saved and how you're saved, you might believe in vain. In other words, that that gift will be useless in your life. I can't use this. I can't how can I use the message? How can I use the the Bible? You know, how how can I use this? You've forgotten what the message is. You've forgotten what the gospel is. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. The second reason he writes, he's assuring the believers of their future bodily resurrections. Now, in this big huge church where everybody had a miracle, everybody had a tongue, everybody had a revelation, everybody had a brand new song, everybody had some revelation of the Bible, some of them were saying, "Oh, we're not going to resurrect. There's no resurrection." Remember that same idea Jesus said was with the Sadducees. Remember that? The Pharisees believed in the resurrection. The Sadducees did not. The Sadducees gave that little riddle. Well, there's a woman who married seven brothers and she never had any children. Whose husband is she going to be? And he said, "You don't understand the power of God." Hallelujah. He said, "God's not the God of the dead. God's the God of the living." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, he said, uh, angels, he said, he said, in the resurrection, they'll be like the angels. There's no marrying. So, that woman's not going to marry with one of those seven men or something like that. There's not that. They're going to they're not going to have any sex glands. They're not going to have those desires. They're going to be like the angels. Holy. &gt;&gt; That's right. But even amidst all these supernatural prophecies and miracles, some people are saying, "Oh, there's no resurrection. This is all we're living for right here." How sad is that? Verse. And then the third reason, he wants to explain how the dead are raised and which bodies they will possess. Because in verse 35 it said some men will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come up? And he says thou fool. So fools fools don't believe God can even raise up dead bodies. If God sent the body and gave it life, God can raise up a dead body. Hallelujah. But yet Paul says that's foolish to think God can create something that dies and God can't bring it back to life. Oh, thank God. There's hope for a resurrection. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is so great. He will resurrect all. He will, the Bible said, will resurrect everybody for the white throne judgment. [snorts] Now, let's get into chapter 15 here by God's grace. Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preach unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand by which also you are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preach unto you, unless you have believed in vain. So, church, look at these three things you must do. You must receive it. It's not enough just to receive it. After you receive it, then you got to stand in it. Well, brother Jesse, I went up to the altar. I got baptized. That's great. That's just receiving it. But now you got to stand in it while other people will fall with it. &gt;&gt; Or other people will never stand in the gospel. You've got to stand against the trials of life. You got to stand against liars and deceivers and temptations of Satan who's like a roaring lion seeking to devour you. You've got to stand against him and resist him. &gt;&gt; Remember this is just right. Remember what Jesus said with the four grounds? Remember he said that one seed fell on the ground and it rejoiced for a while, right? But then the Bible said Satan came away and snatched it out of their heart. So you got to you have to do more than just receive it. You have to stand with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Kind of looks like the three works of grace if I'm not mistaken. There's three steps in here. And third, now here's what we're dealing with today because most of you are believers. You must keep the gospel in your memory. You must give the gospel attention in your mind. You have to set aside time all throughout the week to get the gospel focus on your thoughts. Hallelujah. Or maybe I said vice versa. To get your thoughts focused on the gospel. Yes, we've all got to work. But you know, if you're honest, you can think about Jesus while you're working. Hallelujah. You can think about Jesus while you're taking the test, can't you, Brother Patrick? Yeah, I've been there, buddy. I've taken a lot of tests in my life, and I give a lot of tests in my life. You can think about Jesus while you're doing it. You must keep it in memory. And so, Paul is rehearsing the danger of false conversions just as he addressed in Galatia. Now, let's read that. Keep your spot there. Let's go to Galatians uh 4:19. This is important because all of us have seen people come into the church or come into other churches and then they leave and you and but yet they said they were born again. Well, how could you be born again and do that church? We don't know. But we we can do this. If they don't live the life, we can doubt whether they were born again. Hallelujah. Galatians 4:19. This is what happened to Paul. Paul helped uh No, Paul did not start the church of Galatia, but Paul Paul's brethren started it. He went and preached to them and then over the years that now they changed the gospel and said, "No, you men do need to be circumcised." And Paul said, "I doubt whether you were born again." So, see church, it's wonderful if you start serving God, but time is going to test you. God is going to allow you to be tested to see to show you what is in your heart. &gt;&gt; And the Galatians had fear, right? &gt;&gt; They wanted to try to add something to the gospel. It's not enough to believe, well, I've got to go get circumcised now. I'm saved. No, you're deceived. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "You're foolish to add anything to the gospel." Now, let's look at this here. Now, I don't have it. We just got our Bibles. My little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you. So anyone that adds legalism to the gospel, Paul would say, you need to be born again. You were not born the first time. Look at verse 20. I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for I stand in doubt of you. So see see church all the people that have come into our church say they're born again and leave because of sin. We have a right to say I doubt they were born again because the Bible said they went out from us because they were not of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See that? So Paul addressed some people are falsely converted right or they they they made it out of Egypt. They get justified, but they don't get sanctified or they don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Church, you better go all the way. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You better make sure you believe, you receive, you stand, you keep these things in memory so that your faith, it lasts. It stands the test. And the gospel has an effect on your life and it's not done something that's in vain in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] So remember, I said this earlier. I've rehearsed this numerous times, but grace is a gift according to Paul, not by works, lest any man should boast. &gt;&gt; But therefore, it can also be rejected. People can receive that seed like the parable, but then they can allow Satan to snatch it out of their hearts. Only God knows. We don't know for sure. Alls we can do is just doubt that they are born again and pray for them to come back to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or any church. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter where they go. as long as they go to a church, they're feeding on the word of God, and they live a life that's worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, let's read these so you can see them. 1 Corinthians uh 9:27. So, here even Paul says, you know, I could stand in doubt. If I fell away, he said, I uh then I wouldn't be saved. Verse 27, but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast away. So, in other words, none of us know truly for sure uh that uh that we're sealed with the Holy Spirit, right? None of us know. We have a testimony and we want to believe it, but Paul says, "I've got to keep sin out of my life. I've got to crucify my desires of sin or else I could be a cast away as well." Like brother Ram said, I can't I can't prove to you that my name is up in heaven. &gt;&gt; Like who's ever taken their cell phone up to heaven, take a picture. Oh, my name's on the book of life. And then come back down and say, "Look what I got. I got proof. I'm I'm I got proof I got the Holy Ghost." You can't do it. Cell phones won't go in the rapture. Praise God. Cell phones can't be uh translated. Hallelujah. And that's the point Paul's making. We have a responsibility down here on earth. We're believing we're saved. We believe we're sealed with the Holy Ghost, but we're gonna keep all the sin out of our lives as proof that we are sealed by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. 2 Corinthians 6:1. 2 Corinthians 6:1. We then as workers together with him beseech you or beg you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain. Hallelujah. So Paul says it numerous times, people can receive God's grace, but if they forget about the gospel, then it will be in vain. Right? Judas is the best example. All of his service was in vain because he sold out Jesus Christ at the end. Now verse three. Now here's where we're going to get to some good old time religion. Hallelujah. Now Paul reminds them who started this Corinthian church. Paul did. Hallelujah. So Paul's writing a letter to a church that he started. It'd be like me, all right? Because I uh I helped start this church with six of six other adults. It'd be like me moving away and then writing a letter and say, "Listen, I God used me to help start this church with the saints." Right? So Paul's writing them saying, "Remember, I delivered to you first that which I received." So first the preacher has to receive from God and then he preaches it to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what I did when I came to Akran. God gave me the message in Akran and then I started preaching the message in Akran. &gt;&gt; And now we got a church here. &gt;&gt; I received it through brother Simon. Right. I received the word of God through brother Simon. Studied myself approved and now I preach it and now we got a church here. Just like Paul's day. The preacher has to receive the word of God, then preach the word of God. Yes. And church, how how did Paul start this church? Well, of course, uh Jesus gave him a night vision and said, "Don't fear the city of Corenth." Remember, he lived with justice in a house right next to the Jewish synagogue. He lived in that house and a vision came by night. God spoke to him in a vision and said, "I have many people in this city. do not leave this city and don't fear for your life. Hallelujah. And so Paul started the church. But first he had met with Jesus in the Arabian desert or modern-day Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and was given the gospel. He was given the revelation. Hallelujah. And then Jesus sent him to the city of Corinth. Now, here is the beautiful, simple, but yet powerful summary of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Right? We know John 3:16, right? That's a beautiful summary. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. But this is another way to paraphrase it as well. And this is what Paul preached to start the church. You You might think, "Well, Brother Jesse, what what if I'm going to start a church, what would God have me to say?" You might wonder. Well, here's an answer right here. This is how you start a church in the book of Acts. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. I hope I'm not losing you by God's grace. For I delivered this to you because I received this from Jesus that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and he rose again on the third day according to the scriptures. Imagine you could start a church by this simple message. Jesus Christ died for our sins. He was buried and he rose according to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's all you need to start a church. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Is that enough for you to be a part of a church?" &gt;&gt; Would you have joined the Corinthian church by that simple message? There's no seven seals in there. Hallelujah. My there's no seven seals. Uh uh there's no seven church ages in there. He started the church by saying, "You're sinners." Jesus died to take your sin away. He was buried and then he rose again. That's enough to start a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; brother Chris. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, they preach the revelation of the Old Testament. You see it in Paul's letters, brother, like in Romans, Paul will make a point and then he'll cite numerous Old Testament verses to back up. So Jesus gave him a revelation of what he needed to preach, but then he could go back in the Old Testament and find verses that supported it. And it also prepared Paul for the future ages, the future seven church ages. It's a great question. Give them to class. You're Catholic. Hallelujah. Now just remember here, church, the gospel means good news. So it is good news. It should be good news to you that Jesus Christ died for your sins. You do not have to pay for your sins because Jesus already paid for them. &gt;&gt; That should be good news and so good that you want to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, where did the Old Testament foretell the death, burial, and resurrection? There's many places, but I'm just giving you three. His death was forel foretold by Isaiah 800 years before Christ. He said, "For he was cut out of the land of the living." thing. So cut out means to be d to die, right? To be crucified. The Bible said he would be buried in the same chapter and he made his grave with the wicked with the rich in his death. And then the David said a thousand years before he was on the earth that he would resurrect because thine holy one would neither see corruption. Corruption of the body sets in after three days. Hallelujah. So corruption would not Jesus would raise within three days. Hallelujah. So this was enough to start a book of acts church. Amen. I'll say it like this. It ought to be enough for us to have a book of acts church today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I just thought, you know, this week I read through chapter one of the church age book. I'm trying to get back into that. It's only like 28 pages. But I read over this. And let's remember, church, that you were loosed from your sins and that your curse was taken away. &gt;&gt; You need to remember that. If you don't remember that, you might feel like you're serving God in vain. That your faith is in vain. Revelation 1 vers5 said, "Unto him that hated us." Well, why do you let the devil tell you that he hates you? But unto him that's discouraged with us. Is that what it says? Hallelujah. Come on, church. Hallelujah. Unto him that loved us. &gt;&gt; Jesus loves you. &gt;&gt; That's why he died for you. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. &gt;&gt; The word washed in the Greek actually means loosed. loose from our own sins in his in his own blood. Isn't that wonderful? But let me ask you, church, are you spiritual minded when I read that? Did you catch it? Catch what, brother Jesse? That it was God's own blood that he created. Not human blood that was contaminated by sin, but God made a special new blood. The blood of virgin-born savior Jesus Christ. Holy blood, not born through sexual desire, but through a virgin birth. It was God's own blood that loosed us completely from our sins. It was not human blood. It was the blood of God. Peter called it the blood of Christ. Paul called it the blood of the Lord, the blood of Jesus. And brother Ram says, consider this. Since it is the blood of God, it is perfect blood. And if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage of and defilement of sin, then the loosing is perfect and complete. So just to keep it simple, perfect blood, perfect forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That ought to make somebody shout today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll shout. IF YOU'RE NOT, I'LL SHOUT HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Perfect blood has perfectly forgiven me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It wasn't my blood, therefore it's not my forgiveness. It's his blood. It's his forgiveness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you and I have trouble forgiving ourselves, &gt;&gt; but God does it because it's perfect blood. &gt;&gt; And he poured out, Nia, all of your sins. All of my sins, Malachi, all of your sins, all of our sins, brothers, he poured upon Jesus. And now Jesus paid the the penalty for those sins. So we get perfect forgiveness. Consider that this morning, church, if the devil's trying to uh discourage you or make you feel unworthy, consider that. Well, I know I'm not worthy myself, but I am worthy in what Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Consider that today. &gt;&gt; Let's consider it by God's grace. Let's keep it in our minds. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that our belief is not in vain, but our belief has effect and our belief has fruits to it. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the loosing is perfect and complete. Now, there is therefore no condemnation in Christ Jesus. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifith, declares us righteous. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died. So the only way you can be condemned is if you reject the death of Jesus. &gt;&gt; But if you accept the death of Jesus, you cannot be condemned. &gt;&gt; So you know church, we often worry, well, what what's what is it going to be like on the day of judgment? He just told it told us what it's going to be like. There'll be nothing laid to your charge because all that you did was already laid upon Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, precious is the flow that makes us white as snow. &gt;&gt; No [screaming] other fountain I know, nothing but the blood of Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil can't lay anything to your charge. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no person out there in this world that can lay anything to your charge because God's already forgiven you. &gt;&gt; I don't know who this is for, but I hope it's for somebody by God's grace. If not, it's just for me then. And so I'm going to relieve here with overwhelming joy. Hallelujah. Amen. There it is. His death gave us the blood. The blood has loosed us now. There is now no condemnation. How can there be? &gt;&gt; So the devil says, "You're going to be condemned. You're going to be condemned." Tell the devil, "How can there be?" &gt;&gt; Perfect blood gave me perfect forgiveness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That sound Does that sound like good news to anybody? &gt;&gt; Could we start a church with those words? &gt;&gt; Paul did. Amen. [applause] Hallelujah. How can there be any condemnation to me? So the next time Satan tries to talk to you, tell him that. How can there be anything against me? &gt;&gt; Jesus already p Jesus' death paid for my forgiveness. His blood took my place, pardoned my sin, paid my debt that I owed. And so now I don't owe anything anymore. &gt;&gt; Jesus paid my debt. &gt;&gt; There is nothing to be condemned for. What about the devil says, "What about that yesterday? What about that last night? What about that last week? I confessed it. It's forgiven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can there be, devil? &gt;&gt; There's no condemnation. You can't lay anything to my charge. &gt;&gt; Nobody can lay anything to God's children to their charge because Jesus already took all the suffering and all the pain for your sins. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was already all the guilt and shame was already placed on him so that we don't have to have it placed on us. &gt;&gt; What a good lesson to remind this church in Corenth &gt;&gt; because they were arguing. Well, you I'm taking you to court. I'm going to get my money back. You owe me. But in Jesus' eyes, you don't owe anybody nothing. Hallelujah. Oh, no. This this preacher is way better than that preacher. But the blood of Jesus Jesus says all preachers are falling short of God's glory. &gt;&gt; There's no great ones among us. &gt;&gt; The only great one is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, see how see how this solves all the problems in the church. Christ died for all of our sins. Well, brother Jesse, you did this. Well, so did you did something, too. &gt;&gt; We all need the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive our sins. Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect blood gave you and I perfect loosing &gt;&gt; and therefore we for we can forgive people because we've been forgiven. &gt;&gt; We do not lay things to people's charge. We can doubt their experience. Yes, we can doubt that and hope they get a real birth of the Holy Ghost. But we cannot lay anything to their charge. Only God can do that. And God won't do it if we believe the gospel. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to man. I'll say this. Don't listen to the devil either. &gt;&gt; Listen to the word. &gt;&gt; You are loosed by the blood. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again. &gt;&gt; I don't think you caught it. Well, some people did. You are loosed from guilt and shame by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; if it's a perfect blood, then it's perfect forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And don't forget that, church. If you forget it, you might believe in vain. &gt;&gt; Next, let's remember, you're not going to be cursed, right? You and I will not be cursed on the day of judgment because Jesus Christ already took your curse. &gt;&gt; And so, therefore, you don't have a curse anymore. The Bible said, "Christ hath redeemed us." Let's all say us. Ready? Us. That's you and I. Us. from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. He became sin that we might be made his. &gt;&gt; Very good. Second uh Corinthians 5:21. &gt;&gt; For it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that the blessing. So, we're all we're worried about, am I going to be cursed? Am I going to curse? And the Bible's trying to tell us you're blessed. &gt;&gt; You're chosen. You're loose. You're washed. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. &gt;&gt; The blessing of Abraham came through the cross to the Gentiles. The Jews rejected the cross. Therefore, Jesus got the Gentile bride. How many Gentiles we got in here? &gt;&gt; Every hand should be up. &gt;&gt; If you're not a Jew and if you don't celebrate all the feasts of Israel, your hand should be up. I'm a Gentile. And that that's a good that's a good thing because you got the blessing, not the curse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And like I said on Wednesday, remember I showed you that if 144,000 Jews get the Holy Ghost in the tribulation, that's only 1.4% of all Jews. That means 98.6 are still with a curse on them. Think about that. 98% of the Jews are going to be cursed during the tribulation because they reject Christ as Messiah and they're not born again. Right? So, the majority of Jews are cursed by their sin, their love for sin. The majority of Gentiles are cursed by their sin. But you have been chosen to be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have been chosen to be loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ. You've received good news, not bad news. And I guess I'll just preach till my voice goes out. Hallelujah. Still recovering from that sickness, but God is good. How many want Malachi to lead more songs? &gt;&gt; Did you hear that, buddy? I'm not going to pressure you, but I like to joke with you, though. I want him to lead songs as he feels led of the Holy Spirit. Praise God. I never want to I never want to force anybody into anything by God's grace. Verse five. And he that was now oh yeah and that he was seen of Cphus then of the 12. So after sharing this beautiful gospel message that Jesus Christ died for our sins was buried and resurrected according to the scriptures Paul gives a list list of faithful witnesses of the resurrection. So church if you're going to prove to an unbeliever about the gospel could you do any better than Paul? What do you think? No. Paul actually saw Jesus face to face. So don't don't don't worry and don't fret like, "Well, I don't know what to say." Just say what Paul said. What? Why are you a Christian? Because Jesus Christ died for my sins and he rose for my justification and he sent the Holy Ghost and now I've got the Holy Ghost in my heart. &gt;&gt; That's all you got to say. If they're a believer, they'll accept it. If not, it shows what seed is inside of them. At least as far as until they repent, right? sometime in the future. We can't do better than Paul, right? We can't change Paul's gospel. &gt;&gt; This either works or it doesn't work. How many know it works? Hallelujah. It works in my life. Hallelujah. If it works in my life, it'll work in your life if you're a believer. Hallelujah. So after saying the simple gospel message, now he tells these Corinthians, I started this church and listen, I'm going to give you six witnesses that know he was resurrected. And if that's not enough, too bad. You don't want to believe, &gt;&gt; right, church? Like I heard a good evangelist, Ray Comfort, say this. He said, uh, he said, you know, by by logic, I can prove Noah's arc by logic. If you take the smallest, if you take male and female of all those animals, they will fit onto those dimensions. It's logic. He said, but then I can't explain how God spoke through a donkey, right? A scientist would never accept that. Oh, animals can't talk. So he see he said he said that's not the gospel, right? If you just try to convince somebody by facts, that's not the gospel. To preach the gospel, you have to tell people that they're sinners and they love sin and they're going to hell if they don't accept forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That's the root of the gospel. You know, you can argue all day about all these facts. You can argue all day about all these things, but you got to bring it down to they are a sinner and they need to accept the good news. They got to accept the reality. They're going to hell if they don't repent of all their sins. &gt;&gt; Right? And so that's what Ray Comfort does. He just goes through four of the ten commandments. He said, "Have you ever taken the name of the Lord in vain?" And every person says, "Yes." "Have you ever had lustful thoughts?" They all say yes. "Have you ever uh coveted after something somebody else wants?" Yes. Have you ever stole anything? Yes. Have you ever lied? Yes. Well, there's five of them right there. He said, "You've already broken five of God's ten commandments. So on the day of judgment, is God going to send you to heaven or hell?" And every one of them answer, "Hell." So then he says, "Now he's got you backed up, right?" And everybody has to answer the same for all those. Hallelujah. And when he's got you back in the corner, then he says, "What did God do for guilty sinners so that we could be forgiven of our sins and go to heaven? And 99% of them say he sent his son Jesus Christ to die for our sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to convince people by all these facts. That's not going to keep them. What's going to keep them is that they're a sinner and they need a savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. So Paul lists six groups. So I guess, you know, if you add them all up, there's over uh 500 witnesses. So Paul says Jesus Christ died, he resurrected, died for our sins. And on top of all that, Corinthians, there's over 500 people that saw Jesus Christ raised. Cphus, which was Peter, the 12, and they saw him on the evening of the resurrection. Now, yeah, Jesus met uh Peter one-on-one shortly after the resurrection. Remember, Peter ran down there to find him. He didn't find him. Shortly after that, Jesus met Peter one-on-one. And then when Peter was with the other 11 that night, when they were hiding away, Jesus revealed himself to the rest of the the 12. But they call it the 12. But Judas wasn't there. They just called it the 12 because that that was their name. They were the 12. And then he showed himself to 500 brethren either in Galilee or at his ascension near Bethany. And then he revealed himself to James, the halfb brotherther of the Lord Jesus. Remember Jesus had at least seven siblings, right? So does God like big families? &gt;&gt; Sister Janet, does God like big families? She has nine. She had nine in her family. glory. And then he showed himself to all the apostles probably at the Sea of Galilee in John chapter 21. And then Paul said, "Last of all, he showed himself to me. I've seen the resurre I've seen the resurrected Christ." Now, let's go through these church. Why is this so important? I hope it's going to be important to you by the end of this message here. I'm already on verse five. I got six more verses to go. So after the gospel message he was seen of Cphus. Cphus means stone in Aramaic but the word Peter is means stone in the Greek. So you can say either either one means stone. Whether you say Cphus or Peter they both mean stone. Now Peter was a significant witness because he he rose to follow Jesus. He fell by denying him three times right in his face and then rising again and receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Church, take courage despite your failures. &gt;&gt; You might you might say, "Oh, I embarrassed myself. I I I disgraced Jesus in front of all those people." Join the club. So did Peter. Peter denied Jesus. And the third time the Bible said they locked eyes. He said, "I've denied you." And he runs away and cries and weeps bitterly. You couldn't have anything worse than that, could you? Remember, we remember the woman who was caught in an act of adultery. She's in the very act of it. And what does Jesus give to her? Mercy. &gt;&gt; You're in the very act. And then brought into the presence of Jesus. He doesn't bring judgment. He brings mercy. God's trying to bring us mercy. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I love the witnesses. Paul chooses the man who was bragging, saying, "I'll die with you." But yet, his bragging fell down to the ground. &gt;&gt; He wasn't as strong as he thought he was. Right, brothers? &gt;&gt; Well, I'll do this. I'll go DO THAT. I'LL SHOW YOU THAT. I'll I'll die for you. And sometimes, brothers and sisters, we brag like we got something and we can't even back it up. But Jesus forgives even braggers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus forgives boasters. &gt;&gt; Jesus forgives those who deny him if you'll humble yourself and repent. What a list of believers we got here. And then the 12. Now he showed himself to the 12 in John chapter 20. Remember the Bible said they locked themselves in for fear of the Jews. So Jesus walks through the door. The Bible says it. So when you got a glorified body, you'll walk through the walls. Hallelujah. If if at the rapture the dead in Christ rise first, imagine if we saw him walk through these doors. Amen. Imagine if we saw Paul and John and Peter and all these saints, Brother Random and Martin Luther and John Wesley start walking through the walls. Well, we'll we'll have rapturing faith then by God's grace. Hallelujah. And church, Jesus said, "Have peace in your life despite the fact they were scattered like sheep from the shepherd." Despite running away from the truth, despite abandoning your family, despite abandoning your other brothers and sisters, anything you've done wrong, despite that, Jesus is offering you peace today if you'll remember his commands. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he speaks peace to a group of 12 that had forsaken Jesus Christ. If you've forsaken the church, the body of Christ I'm talking about. If you've even forsaken this church, if you've forsaken your family that were Christians, there's forgiveness for you. Just come back to Jesus. &gt;&gt; And then on top of all that, he's he's saying, "I'll get you." He said, "As God sends me, I'm going to send you." And then he breathes on them and say, "Receive the Holy Ghost." Which they would get in about 49 more days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, this sounds like amazing grace to me. &gt;&gt; I I can fall flat on my face. I can I I can be a total failure. I can run. I can show fear. I can bring disgrace on God. And yet, he'll forgive me. Yes. Because you're predestinated. You're you're chosen to be adopted. You're already a part of the family of God. Despite your mistakes, God wants you to come back to the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we got Peter, we got the 12 who were also failures. And then he showed 500 brethren at once, of whom the greater part of remain unto the present, but some are fallen asleep. Now, this probably took place at Galilee because remember Galilee was Jesus's headquarters for the most part of his ministry, the northern part of Israel. Remember, he told them, he said, "Be not afraid. Go tell my brethren that go to Galilee and they there shall they see me." So Jesus probably appeared to 500 believers at once in Galilee because that was his headquarters of his ministry. And after that he was seen of James and then of all the apostles. Now I I found this out yesterday when I went and studied this. James was the halfb brotherther of Jesus. But this is significant that Paul names him because James did not believe in Jesus until after the resurrection. Imagine James was raised up up with Jesus. And Jesus was the oldest child in the family, right? And Jesus always did what Mary and Joseph said. He never got spanking, right? So James would, oh, he's always the goody douches. He never does anything wrong. He had to battle the sin nature, too, like you and I. Hallelujah. But even the Bible says as he got older in Mark 3:21 and John 7:5, James and the brothers did not believe Jesus was the Messiah. So Jesus had to show himself as a resurrected Christ to his halfbrother so he would believe. Hallelujah. And then Paul says, "Well, look at this man. He's a believer. He doubted for all those years of his life, but now he's believer." And after he got the Holy Ghost, he became like the pastor or one of the head apostles in Jerusalem. And then he even wrote the book of James. So this tells us don't give up on people in your family. &gt;&gt; If they don't believe, don't give up. Just keep praying. Pray that Jesus will show himself to your loved ones. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And last of all, he's gone through five different groups. Last of all, he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the least of the apostles that I'm not me to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God. So where does Paul place himself first? Did he make himself the greatest of all the witnesses? Did he make himself the goat? He places himself last. Now if you look in the Greek, born out of due time means an abortion or an untimely birth. something really bad and tragic. So just as an abortion is unwanted and unfit and just tragic, so was his persecution of the body of Christ. Hallelujah. That's how awful it is, church, to persecute Christians. It's like an abortion, right? It's just it's so unwanted. It's so tragic. It's so awful. An untimely birth. Oh yeah. In other words, for nine months, we're expecting these w this wonderful child or children if it's twins or or triplets or something like that. But then have that awful disappointment. That's what Paul says. That was my life when I was persecuting the Christians. It's like having an awful disappointment of an untimely birth or a miscarriage. So we can see how Paul humbled himself. Church, it would help us to be a little more humble in our Christian life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'd be helpful if we put ourselves last. &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother Jesse, we got the seven seals. I believe that. We've got the revelation Godhead. I believe that. But let's see how much more humble we can be with it rather than how prideful we can be with it. &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. Look at that. I'm almost to verse 11. Can Can you believe it? Hallelujah. Verse 10. But by the grace of God, I love that phrase. But by the grace of God. I say I say that all the time. By God's grace. Right? You hear me say by God's grace. By God's grace. By God's grace. Brother Jesse. When are you gonna stop saying by God's grace? I don't know. Maybe when I get raptured, but I just want I just want God's grace to be a part of all my decisions. So other words, Paul says, "My persecution of the church was like an abortion. And it was so awful. It's like I was born out of due time. My uh I was persecuting the church. I wish I would not have. He said, "But I can't go back and change it. By God's grace, I am what I am." Church, you and I, we can't change the past. So, we can't worry about it. We can't fret about it. We just have to say, "God's grace was there. God's grace brought me through it. But God's grace is here now. And now God's grace is here to lead me forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's grace, which is his unmmerited favor, his divine favor. God's going to give you favor even though you don't deserve it. Hallelujah. So God's grace empowers your future service. We must labor for the kingdom of God by the grace of God that is with us. I love this. His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain. God didn't give me this grace in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all than the 500. Imagine that. Paul could say, "I worked harder than the 500 that actually saw him after the resurrection." He can say, "I worked harder with the gospel than Cphus. I worked harder than all 12 of them." And they would all admit that, right? Because they gave each other the right hand of fellowship. In the book of Galatians, it says that they all recognize Paul was a worker. But where did he place himself? He placed himself last. And then he he doesn't take credit for it. Brother Mercy, I love this. He doesn't take credit for all the work. He gives credit to the grace of God. The grace that was with him caused him to work harder. &gt;&gt; You don't have to raise your hand, but who would like to work harder for God? It's not going to be you that does it. It's going to be the grace of God. So, you will let you will receive the grace of God. You'll receive more. The Bible said he gives us more grace. Amen. There it is. And the Hallelujah. There it is. God gives us more grace. So, the more you receive of God's gracious word, the more you'll want to work for him. What have you done to to date for the Lord? How many souls have you won? Hallelujah. How many songs have you sang for the Lord? How many people have you witness to? How many people have you prayed for? Praise God for what you have done. It is God's grace that will empower you to do more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I like what that brother uh remember brother David Hawkins came. You remember his testimony? He said, "I don't want to preach until I've led someone to the Lord." I thought that was a good thing. But do you remember that? What was his testimony after that? Do you remember? He said he just preached his his testimony and a girl came up, a young lady came up, teenager, he prayed for her and she started screaming, shouting, weeping. She received the Holy Ghost. He said, "Well, that's good enough for me." Amen. I like that. Hallelujah. See, we ask God for things we want, but God's going to give us something better than what we want. Praise God. &gt;&gt; What is it better to be saved or to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Baptism Holy Ghost because you can lose your salvation but you cannot lose the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. I like that. Hallelujah. So church, that's what you need to do. As we said at the beginning, find your position and then invest in that position by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; [cough and clears throat] &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. Here we are. We come down to the last verse. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "We're almost done." 12:00. Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preached, and so ye believed. So I my thoughts on this. It doesn't matter who preached the gospel to you, their past. Now, think of the person who first preached to you. They have a sinful past may not be as sinful as mine. May not be as sinful as others, but everybody's got a sinful past. Who whoever preached the gospel to you, whether it was like Peter's details. So, think about that. Those pe some of those believers could have said, "My goodness, Peter preached the gospel to me, but Peter also denied Christ three times." Hallelujah. You got saved through the preacher who denied him. How do you know that preacher is not going to deny him again? You don't know. All you know is he says he's got the Holy Ghost. Amen. And you watch his fruit. You watch his life. Hallelujah. So what what's Paul saying? Paul's placing emphasis on the power of the gospel, not on the power of a man. &gt;&gt; So your faith is not in me or any preacher or any preacher you knew in Ghana. Hallelujah. or Nicaragua. Hallelujah. Or uh Toledto, Ohio or Delta, Ohio, or wherever you heard a preacher, your faith is not in a preacher, your faith is in the message that the preacher preached. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whether you got saved under Peter, the Christ denier but forgiven one, under James, the one who refused to believe for all those years, but now he believes. It doesn't change the gospel message that Jesus Christ died for your sins. He was buried and he was resurrected according to God's promised scriptures. We should just be thankful and believe the gospel message. Hallelujah. I'm not sure. I'm closing with this. Yep. There's So, I'm going to close with this here, church. There is no excuses to disbelieve. Some people say, "Well, I'm not going to believe because the preacher." Well, you could have said that about James. You could have said that about Peter. People today are saying, "Well, brother Graham did this. Look at Brother Graham." Right? I'm not saved because of brother Brandham or Billy Graham or O Roberts. &gt;&gt; I'm saved because of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I believe if this was good enough to preach to Corinthians who have way more tongues, interpretation, and miracles than us, then I believe it's good enough for us. Hallelujah. No, but they also had more sins than we had. Hallelujah. They had more gifts, but they also have more sins than we have. Because we just showed you that long list of sins. And church, it seems like from the text, they even allowed women preachers because why else would he tell them not to have women preachers? Why would he say that unless they had women preachers? Hallelujah. So, I could add another one to that. Now, they got women with dominating female Jezebel spirits running the church, trying to tell the church what to do, rather than a God- called man behind the pulpit who's submissive to the Holy Spirit. So friends, there's no excuse to disbelieve this gospel message. Remember what the Bible said. God is going to pour out his wrath in the sooncoming tribulation period from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men because they hold the truth in unrighteousness. See, they know the truth, but they live a sinful lifestyle. Now, here's the two reasons. There's no excuses. Because that which may be known of God is already manifested in them. All you have to do is look at your life, your mind, your body, your soul, and realize there is a God. &gt;&gt; Somebody gave me life. Somebody created this being. I can think up thoughts. I can learn. I can do I can do lots of things. Someone gave me this. So, there must be a God. &gt;&gt; Did you ask to come to Earth? Did you ask to have black hair or blonde hair? Did you ask to have blue eyes or brown eyes? Did you ask? No. Somebody sent you here and determined that and showed that God was manifesting himself in your body. Hallelujah. So just looking at your body, every person knows there's a God and there's no excuses. &gt;&gt; Amen. Second, the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by things that are made. So all of creation, the sunrise, the sunset, the beautiful snow we had last night, right? Everybody think that was beautiful lesson. Haven while she was dancing out in the snow last night. Just such a beautiful snow. Every creation, all the animals, right? All the insects, all these, we had a slug on our window. That's a creation of God today. All the creation is proof that there's a creator. &gt;&gt; All the creation shows his eternal power and godhead. So that they are without excuse. &gt;&gt; There'll be no excuses on the day of judgment. &gt;&gt; Because you have a body that God made and everything you see is what God made. The Bible says the fool says there is no God. Only a fool is an atheist. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Because they have to deny everything in their body. They have to deny everything that their eyes see. And they're fools to say there's no God." And we'll show you why in just a moment. The Bible said the heavens are preaching the glory of God to them. Every day the the sun and the stars and the moon are preaching to every person, "God is great. God is mighty. There is a God. There is a heaven. There is a hell. Everything in the all creation is preaching them and God saying just believe. &gt;&gt; The Bible said the firminant shows his handiwork. My this guy is handy. Talk about a handyman. Hallelujah. The day utters God's speech. The night shows the knowledge of God. How smart God is. Watch the stars and the planets. Hallelujah. And the constellations, you'll see how smart God is. Hallelujah. And there is no speech or language wherein their voice is not heard. Everyone in the face of the whole earth from all time all throughout all 6,000 years of history is is accountable uh to God to believe. And if they don't, then they're lost. So what's the real reason people are lost? Because they don't believe. Why don't they believe? Because they love sin more than they love righteousness. The Jesus Christ said, "This is the condemnation that light is coming to the world." The Bible's coming to the world, but men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. That's why people will be lost. There's no excuses in their body. Their body tells them there's a God. All nature preaches to them there's a God. The reason they'll be lost, 98% in Israel will be lost. How many What's the percentage of Gentiles? 99.999 will be lost because they love sin more than they loved holiness. For everyone that doeth evil hates the light, hates the gospel. Neither cometh to the light, lest his deed should be reproved. So see church, you can't remain in your sin and call yourself a Christian. If you're a Christian, you become Christlike. &gt;&gt; Christ did not sin. So if you're a Christian, you'll want to stop sinning. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. I got two more slides. These are my last three last three slides. I like what Ray Comfort did. He went up to these guys at the uh their doctorates of uh biology, their doctorates of science, and he said, "Is do you believe in intelligent designer?" And they said, "No, we don't believe in intelligent designer." He said, "No." And then he said, "Okay, design me a brand new rose. Design me one." They said, "I can't." And he said, "But you got to start with your own materials. You can't use God's, right?" Because God started without any God created it. He spoke the word and it existed. And they say, "Well, I can't I I can't design one." And he said, "Well, then how intelligent are you? If you can't designs, if a rose is so is not intelligent and you can't do one, that makes you very unintelligent. &gt;&gt; But what does it speak? It speaks that God intelligent intelligently designed everything. &gt;&gt; So that's the first one I like to say. Did the Mona Lisa paint itself? No. A painter declares I'm sorry, a painting declares there's a painter. Did the Golden Gate Bridge build itself? No. A building or structure requires a builder. Creation requires a creator. Hallelujah. And the last one is like a book. Would anybody believe this book right here could just somehow fall from the sky and all the language and all the symbols would just be created by random accident? Does anybody believe that nonsense? If so, you're a fool. No, it was intelligently designed. So Ray Comfort says, "If this wasn't designed by something, if this was designed, how much greater is God the designer?" Because your body's full of many books of life. Your body's full of cells that have DNA. And DNA is called the book of life. And the DNA is way longer than this book right here. Hallelujah. And there's billions times trillions of cells in your body. And each one of them has a book of life inside of it that tells your body how tall you're going to be. What color eyes you're going to have. How long your eyelashes are going to be, whether long or short. Hallelujah. How big or small your nose is. Hallelujah. There's already a book of life inside of every single cell. So if it's impossible for this to create itself, so is it impossible for your entire body to be created. Aren't you glad you are not a fool? &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's bow our hearts here today. Dear God, we're thankful, Lord God, to know exactly how Paul started the church. Lord, it seems like maybe our church was started on the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. and there's one God and the revelations that you gave us. But eventually, God, we came down to this same starting spot that Jesus Christ died for our sins. Hallelujah. He was buried. He rose on the third day according to the scriptures. He was resurrected for our justification, our being made righteous. Lord, help the people to remember today the curse is gone. The loosing is perfect. We are wise because we believe in God, not fools. Only fools would say that a painting painted itself. Thank you, God, for the wisdom of the Holy Ghost. Lord God, thank you for showing us your eternal power and godhead. Thank you for the good news. And I pray if anyone is struggling with their salvation, I pray they'll remember the simple gospel message that Jesus Christ died to take all of our sins, [music] died to take our curse, and they can be forgiven and know that they're going to heaven. they can have an assurance of their salvation today. Oh God, may the people not lose the mind battle to the devil. May they overcome by the grace of God. Hallelujah. May they fight the good fight of faith. Hallelujah. May they cast out anything that exalts itself against the word of God. May your people come to the light, dear God. May they love holiness and may they hate sin. May each and every person be saved today. If they're not, may they come forward to be saved. Lord, I pray. Lord Jesus, the gospel remains powerful. Hallelujah. The simple revelation of Jesus Christ dying for our sins, being buried, and raising for our justification. Thank you, God, that there's no condemnation to our our lives, Lord God. No man can lay anything to our charge. We're forgiven. We were chosen in Christ and were adopted into the family of God. We bless your holy name for these great truths. Bless your people. Deal with your people, I pray today, in Jesus Christ's name.
