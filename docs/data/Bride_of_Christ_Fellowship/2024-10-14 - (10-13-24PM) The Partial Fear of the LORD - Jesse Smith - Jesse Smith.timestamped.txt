[0:01] 2 Kings
[0:04] 17 I was kind of saving this I thought
[0:06] I'd do a a little kids Bible study on it
[0:08] but I thought I'd just preach it uh by
[0:10] God's grace I want to look at the
[0:11] partial fear of the Lord so I want to
[0:13] look at the partial fear of the Lord
[0:14] I've been teaching on the fear of the
[0:16] Lord but I like to look at uh the
[0:18] partial fear of the
[0:19] Lord it's a great thought I felt like it
[0:22] was a great thought the lord gave me
[0:23] years ago so I haven't preached it for
[0:25] quite a while and then I heard A good
[0:27] sermon from Charles Spurgeon on it he's
[0:29] called The Prince of preachers
[0:30] Hallelujah now I just said there's no
[0:32] preachers but Jesus right but that's
[0:34] what people called him of course he was
[0:35] in the man age brother Ram said they
[0:37] there was no greater sermons than in the
[0:38] Philadelphian Church age brother Braham
[0:40] said that that's what he felt because it
[0:42] was the age of the man anointing so uh
[0:44] what we recognize is that God is uh God
[0:46] was using those brothers so I listened
[0:49] to uh his message and just a tremendous
[0:51] message 2 Kings 17
[1:09] Hallelujah we'll just read one verse
[1:11] because I want to preserve the time
[1:12] verse 33 2 Kings
[1:16] 17:33 while you're turning there I did
[1:18] want to say this too does anybody have a
[1:21] cough I heard some coughing this morning
[1:22] anybody have a cough uh because if
[1:24] they're taking communion let's have the
[1:25] coffers go
[1:28] last do anybody have have a cough
[1:31] anybody have a cough I don't I have not
[1:33] coughed I've been good anybody have a
[1:36] cough all right remember I told you that
[1:40] a couple times ago I said if there's
[1:41] ever sickness in the church let me know
[1:43] we'll just do the little cups we got
[1:44] lots of little cups out there and we can
[1:46] uh just want to keep everybody as
[1:48] healthy as possible by God's grace okay
[1:50] so nobody's got to cough okay so all
[1:53] right
[1:54] Hallelujah 2 Kings 17:33 for there say
[1:58] amen amen
[2:01] looking at the partial fear of the Lord
[2:02] here
[2:03] tonight let's read just verse 33 let's
[2:06] hear your voices on three one 2 three
[2:08] they fear the lord and serve their own
[2:11] Gods after the manner of the Nations
[2:15] whom They Carried Away from then may God
[2:18] add his Blessing to ring of his word you
[2:19] can be
[2:23] seated you over the years I've I've kind
[2:25] of come back to this thought over and
[2:27] over again and then when I heard brother
[2:29] Spurgeon preach on like oh man now I
[2:31] really got to preach this here so I hope
[2:32] it's a help to somebody I hope somebody
[2:34] enjoyed the message this morning by
[2:35] God's grace about being a hero I may
[2:38] preach a couple of sermons on that
[2:39] because brother Ram has like I said 20
[2:41] quotes on it and he goes at it from and
[2:43] every angle you know to win souls or uh
[2:47] you know for your family he takes it
[2:48] from so many different angles be a hero
[2:51] uh find a find a position find your
[2:53] gifts you know he just takes it from all
[2:54] these different angles be a hero in life
[2:57] Hallelujah so I know like I said I know
[2:59] brother Mercy's being a hero bringing
[3:00] his his brothers and sisters to church
[3:02] you keep it up brother that's heroism to
[3:05] me in the modern day so God bless
[3:07] you verse uh now we want to start at
[3:10] verse 24 I'll try to give a background
[3:11] here and uh I'm just going to preach the
[3:14] rest of this chapter so it's the second
[3:16] part of the chapter from 24 um down to
[3:19] 41 if I'm not
[3:23] mistaken I thought this would be a good
[3:25] uh communion message here uh because we
[3:28] don't want a partial fear of the Lord we
[3:30] want a full fear of the Lord hallelujah
[3:33] and so we want to look at this if
[3:34] haven't looked at it for a while uh it
[3:36] was kind of made fresh to
[3:38] me so uh actually before we read 24 I
[3:41] just want to again share remember we
[3:43] defined the fear of the Lord a few weeks
[3:44] ago uh the Old Testament definition it's
[3:46] right Behavior but it's inspired by
[3:49] profound honor so it all starts with
[3:52] that honor when someone has adoration or
[3:54] profound adoration for the Lord that
[3:56] adoration or love for God will move you
[3:58] into the right Behavior
[4:00] so in other words obedience and and
[4:03] that's the Old Testament definition if
[4:04] we looked at the fear of the Lord
[4:06] morally reverence right that's the
[4:08] that's the actual Hebrew definition but
[4:10] if you break it down it means the right
[4:12] Behavior done with the profound honor
[4:15] for God hallelujah and then uh you know
[4:18] the New Testament Jesus summed it up by
[4:20] uh you know the greatest commandment
[4:22] love the Lord your God with all your
[4:23] heart soul mind and strength and then he
[4:25] said if you love me keep my commands so
[4:28] we found that the fear of the Lord is
[4:29] love loving obedience I love to obey
[4:31] God's word I love to please my heavenly
[4:34] father so that's what we want to uh
[4:37] experience here you know in our lives by
[4:39] God's grace we want the true fear of the
[4:41] Lord now there are as we as we're going
[4:44] to see here tonight there's two kinds of
[4:45] fear of the Lord there's this Godly fear
[4:48] of the Lord that we're talking about but
[4:50] there's also what what's we'd say a
[4:52] sinful fear it's the terror of the Lord
[4:55] that's what we're going to see in this
[4:56] chapter so there's two kinds of fears
[4:58] you know we've always said that God do
[4:59] not give us the spirit of fear but yet
[5:01] we're to fear the
[5:02] lord right so God does not give us that
[5:05] Terror right of the Lord in I'm talking
[5:08] about in the in the worldly sense right
[5:10] we'll see it here tonight they only
[5:13] acknowledge God to be kept from being
[5:16] killed so for us it would translate into
[5:19] something I only do religious acts so I
[5:21] don't go to hell that's what the the the
[5:24] other fear of the Lord is and that's a
[5:26] sinful
[5:27] fear okay but the real fear the lord is
[5:30] this loving obedience I Adore You Lord I
[5:33] honor you and I want to behave the right
[5:36] way praise God I want to obey the word
[5:38] of God because remember God does not
[5:40] give the spirit of fear this worldly
[5:42] sinful torment okay so I just want to
[5:46] lay that out again uh as a refreshment
[5:48] to you uh by God's grace you know uh and
[5:52] this this ties in with second
[5:53] Corinthians I don't have the actual
[5:54] verse in front of me but remember the
[5:56] Bible talks about Godly sorrow and
[5:58] worldly sorrow so worldly sorrow would
[6:00] be this sorrow it's sad you got
[6:03] caught right that's worldly sorrow Oh I
[6:06] got caught I you know I was sinning and
[6:10] I didn't mean to get caught but I'm
[6:12] sorry because I got caught it's not like
[6:15] Lord I'm so sorry I didn't want to do
[6:17] this but worldly star was like I wanted
[6:19] to do it I'm just sorry I got
[6:21] caught right that's the only reason
[6:24] people are sad like you know I've been
[6:26] sharing you know different ministers boy
[6:28] 2024 has been a rough year on uh
[6:30] ministers as far as that are not true to
[6:31] God they' fallen in so many things and
[6:34] uh very few of them will actually come
[6:35] out and say they're sorry for what they
[6:37] did they'll just kind of fade off into
[6:39] the Shadows that's worldly sorrow they
[6:42] got
[6:43] caught right in fact the most recent one
[6:45] he was a 73 year old man uh he was
[6:48] having an affair with a 29y old woman
[6:50] he's
[6:51] 73 and it was the parents of the 29y old
[6:54] woman that came to the church and
[6:57] brought the issue and so see it was
[6:59] wasn't the it wasn't the preacher saying
[7:00] I'm so sorry God I'm bringing this it's
[7:03] it's uh it's the parents of this girl
[7:05] bringing it to them and he got caught
[7:08] I'm sorry I got caught but see a real
[7:11] child of God wants a pure heart praise
[7:13] God they want they know God's watching
[7:15] them Hallelujah God sees all things
[7:18] Hallelujah God's eyes run to and fro
[7:20] around the earth uh trying to find
[7:22] someone he can show himself strong in
[7:24] praise God so we know there's a great
[7:26] difference there between you know Godly
[7:28] sorrow is like Peter Lord I'm sorry
[7:31] forgive me you know I love you he said
[7:33] feed my sheep Peter Hallelujah you know
[7:36] I love you but see worldly sorrowful
[7:38] people they get caught they're sorry
[7:40] they're sad about it and uh they they
[7:42] never seem to really get the victory
[7:44] it's not a real true repentance praise
[7:46] God church that's what the theme of this
[7:48] is we have to make sure we get a real
[7:51] repentance we we truly uh take the
[7:54] attitude where we learn to hate our sin
[7:57] and we'll do anything to keep from going
[7:59] going back to that
[8:01] sin all right so I know this is really
[8:03] down to the heart of things it's not
[8:05] really a shouting message uh but it's an
[8:08] important message praise God because
[8:10] it's your soul your soul should not want
[8:12] to uh go back to sin that it's already
[8:14] struggled with right or already been uh
[8:17] uh been guilty of Godly sorrow would
[8:21] make one want to avoid that sin hate
[8:24] that sin hallelujah amen and so that's
[8:28] what we're looking at here tonight by
[8:29] God's grace there's two kinds of fear of
[8:31] the Lord and we want the right kind of
[8:33] fear of the Lord hallelujah remember the
[8:35] Bible said you know I've told people
[8:36] this over the years you know online and
[8:37] here as well you know people say well
[8:40] how can I overcome well I've said just
[8:42] repent and then just get in God's
[8:43] presence because in his presence is
[8:45] fullness of joy amen like it's either
[8:48] true or it's not that's psalm 16 so if
[8:52] you want to if you want to just get away
[8:54] from sin Get In God's Presence you'll
[8:55] never feel a joy like that Hallelujah
[8:58] then when you experience that Joy the
[9:00] cares of the world or the The
[9:01] Temptations of the world their powers
[9:03] were weaken over you because you've got
[9:05] the joy of the Lord and the joy of the
[9:07] Lord is your strength
[9:10] hallelujah it's a blessing Hallelujah to
[9:12] know the Lord hallelujah God is so good
[9:14] to us glory to God now in our text here
[9:19] we we're looking at uh 2 Kings 17:24 and
[9:22] the men I'm sorry and the king of
[9:24] Assyria brought men from Babylon and
[9:26] from Kuan or cut High and from Ava and
[9:30] from HTH and from seph vame and plac
[9:34] them in the cities of Samaria instead of
[9:36] the children of Israel and they possess
[9:37] Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof
[9:41] now remember this is right about the
[9:42] time of
[9:44] Hezekiah so King Hezekiah because if you
[9:47] actually just turn look at the next
[9:48] chapter it's Hezekiah and he has a
[9:52] Revival this is right about the time
[9:54] they're ready for
[9:56] Revival Glory
[9:59] and a lot of the northern tribes have
[10:01] been carried away right Northern Israel
[10:03] had been carried away because of their
[10:06] sins and so uh the king of Assyria says
[10:10] I need to fill in all those parts
[10:12] someone's got to take care of the land
[10:14] right someone's got to live in the
[10:15] houses we don't want this to All Fall
[10:17] Apart it's our land now we conquered
[10:19] them so they brought in all these people
[10:21] to live in
[10:23] Samaria verse 25 and so it was at the
[10:26] beginning of their dwelling there that
[10:27] they feared not the
[10:29] Lord therefore the Lord sent Lions among
[10:33] them which slew some of
[10:35] them so this is quite a story you know
[10:39] uh this is God's land remember the Bible
[10:43] said the Zeal of the Lord will put Jesus
[10:46] on Mount Zion God loves this land God's
[10:49] fighting for this land this is his
[10:51] provided place of
[10:53] worship and so when God's people as
[10:55] disobedient as they were as God's people
[10:57] are carried out
[11:00] God still considers this this is still
[11:01] my land and when these heathens come in
[11:04] they don't fear the lord right they
[11:07] don't even acknowledge Him so what does
[11:09] God do he sends in Lions to slay some of
[11:14] them how many believe that would bring
[11:16] the fear of the Lord on you but we're
[11:18] going to find out it wasn't the real
[11:20] fear of the Lord it was the terror of
[11:22] the
[11:23] Lord right and which we have that in a
[11:25] way I think you understand what I'm
[11:26] saying like we know God can like brother
[11:28] said God can pull our card any time and
[11:29] we'll go up to heaven like you that's
[11:30] what I'm talking about like we have
[11:32] respect for God God's timing is perfect
[11:35] and God can do anything he wants with
[11:36] our lives God doesn't owe me anything
[11:39] God doesn't owe us anything he already
[11:41] paid it all praise God Amen he already
[11:43] paid it all Jesus Paid It all all to him
[11:46] I owe praise God right so we see this
[11:50] here that the Lord sends Lions among
[11:53] them so notice the uh and Charles
[11:56] Spurgeon noticed there there's three
[11:58] states the first first state is they
[12:00] have no fear of the
[12:01] Lord so it's people coming into God's
[12:04] land they don't fear God at all and so
[12:06] what does God do because they won't fear
[12:08] God they got their Idols God sends in
[12:10] Lions to give them some level of fear of
[12:12] the
[12:13] Lord
[12:15] right Hallelujah and this is God's grace
[12:18] right because they're probably doing all
[12:20] their uh burning of children right
[12:23] they're probably doing all their
[12:24] loudness of sexual immorality along with
[12:26] all the idolatry that normally uh accp
[12:29] ined it and God said no you're not going
[12:31] to do that here this is Holy Ground
[12:36] amen verse 26 therefore they spake to
[12:39] the king of Assyria saying the Nations
[12:41] which thou Hast removed and place in the
[12:43] cities of Samaria know not the manner of
[12:45] the god of the
[12:47] land therefore he has sent Lions among
[12:49] them and behold they slay them because
[12:52] they know not the manner of the god of
[12:55] the
[12:56] land so these some these uh heathens now
[12:59] living in Samaria they realize okay this
[13:02] is all happening because we don't know
[13:04] the ways of
[13:05] God this is there's a certain way of God
[13:09] how many know there's a way of God in
[13:10] this church Hallelujah every church
[13:12] right brother Jim brother cam brother uh
[13:16] uh brother Samuel there's a manner God
[13:18] has a manner God uh God demands respect
[13:22] brother Braham says that's the fear of
[13:23] the Lord there God demands it Hallelujah
[13:25] you got to have it right the the fear of
[13:28] the Lord is the beginning of
[13:30] wisdom and so these heathens come in
[13:32] they begin sacrificing they've been
[13:34] doing all their wicked idolatry to the
[13:36] full exent God sends lions in to slay
[13:40] them verse 27 then the king of Assyria
[13:43] commanded saying carry thither one of
[13:44] the priests whom he brought from
[13:47] th and let them go and dwell there and
[13:51] let him teach them the manner of the god
[13:54] of the land then one of the priests whom
[13:57] they had carried away from Samaria came
[13:59] and dwelt in bethl and taught them how
[14:01] they should fear the
[14:03] lord so look they they have to say you
[14:07] know uh if if if if we don't know God we
[14:10] need a preacher to get help us to know
[14:12] the word of God how can we hear how can
[14:15] we believe except God sends us a
[14:17] preacher so see it's always been God's
[14:20] the same yesterday today and forever
[14:21] Hallelujah God's always had a preacher
[14:23] to help people and what does the
[14:25] preacher do he gives them the light the
[14:26] key of knowledge the Bible says the key
[14:29] of knowledge the entrance of light right
[14:31] opens up God's word hallelujah so he
[14:33] sends a priest and tell them they should
[14:36] fear God this is a holy land right this
[14:39] is God's
[14:40] land we need to fear
[14:43] God verse 29 how be every nation made
[14:47] gods of their own and put them in the
[14:49] houses of the high places which the
[14:50] Samaritans had made and every nation in
[14:53] their cities wherein they
[14:54] dwelt and the men of Babylon made Sako
[14:58] benoth and the men of cth made nural and
[15:01] the men of HTH made
[15:05] Ashima verse 31 and the aites made
[15:09] nibhaz and
[15:11] tarac and the sephar sites burnt their
[15:14] children in the fire to adrc and animik
[15:19] the gods of sepher vain so here the
[15:22] Bible tells us plainly these heathens
[15:24] moved in and they were doing the
[15:25] wickedness of sacrifices now again look
[15:28] how much mercy God has on
[15:30] America right 70 million abortions
[15:33] probably more since the 1970s when they
[15:36] changed the law yet we still get
[15:38] rain we still get God's spirit falling
[15:40] among us we still get blessings God
[15:42] gives everybody the rain falls and the
[15:43] just and the
[15:44] unjust our God is full of Mercy rich in
[15:48] Mercy hallelujah amen but God sent
[15:51] because of that was his land he sent
[15:52] Lions there to slay them to wake them up
[15:56] this is not just any land you just can't
[15:57] live however you what in this land This
[15:59] Is My Land even though it's in a
[16:02] backsliding condition my
[16:06] goodness they were burning their
[16:08] children in the fire verse 32 so here's
[16:11] now the second condition the first
[16:13] condition they did not fear God and now
[16:16] in verse 32 they begin to get a partial
[16:20] fear of God so they feared the Lord and
[16:23] made unto themselves of the lowest of
[16:25] them Priests of the high places which
[16:28] which sacrific for them in the houses of
[16:32] the high
[16:34] places now look what they do they they
[16:36] learn from one priest but then they make
[16:39] false priests or they they develop their
[16:41] own priesthood they didn't get the
[16:44] five-fold
[16:45] ministry see so they just like the like
[16:48] we read this morning or we mentioned it
[16:50] the Bible said they' heaped to
[16:51] themselves teachers having itching ears
[16:54] to tell them what they want to hear I
[16:57] don't want to get killed by lion but I
[17:00] also love my other
[17:02] gods I don't want to go all the way with
[17:05] God I like to have some pleasures of the
[17:07] world as
[17:08] well the church
[17:10] said see where we're going Jesus said
[17:13] don't let the cares of the world
[17:14] distract you Idols
[17:17] right don't let uh Mammon don't let God
[17:21] Be Your I'm sorry don't let money be
[17:22] your
[17:23] God all these cares of the world so they
[17:27] start their own tape boy Ministry I'll
[17:30] say but it could be a false five-fold
[17:32] too that's just a little joke there they
[17:34] they develop a false
[17:36] priesthood so that's the point we're
[17:37] making yes and preachers in the Catholic
[17:39] priests in the Catholic church and
[17:40] preachers in the Methodist Baptist
[17:42] Lutheran message anywhere if they're not
[17:43] filled with the Holy Ghost they could be
[17:44] these false priesthood right it's the
[17:47] same thing in other words any preacher
[17:49] that will let you compromise and enjoy
[17:51] pleasures of the world that's not a real
[17:53] preacher
[17:55] Hallelujah I don't always enjoy you know
[17:57] a a hard sermons I don't like to preach
[18:00] hard sermons but I know I got to because
[18:03] church I'm not going to answer to you
[18:04] I'm going to answer to Christ for what I
[18:06] preached that's why I don't apologize if
[18:09] I preach on sin I'm not going to
[18:10] apologize that's what God called me to
[18:12] do Hallelujah but see look look what the
[18:15] world does look what compromisers do
[18:17] they get fake preachers or false
[18:19] preachers that'll let them enjoy
[18:21] pleasures of sin and also have a
[18:23] knowledge of the
[18:24] Lord a partial fear of God
[18:29] this is what happens to many churches
[18:32] right so now we find out that these uh
[18:36] these these people in Samaria they're
[18:38] impersonators right they have a partial
[18:41] fear of God but not a true fear of God
[18:46] they're worshippers but not true
[18:49] worshippers right remember John 4:23 and
[18:52] 24 says the father's looking for true
[18:55] worshippers those who will worship Him
[18:57] in spirit and
[18:59] truth so did these people in Samaria did
[19:02] they have the right Spirit no did they
[19:05] have the truth well partial but they
[19:07] didn't have all the
[19:09] truth God was looking for true
[19:11] worshippers he was looking for young men
[19:13] that would worship God with all their
[19:15] heart soul mind and
[19:17] strength Hallelujah that's what he was
[19:19] looking for he wasn't looking for a
[19:21] partial surrender he was looking for a
[19:23] total surrender praise God
[19:26] hallelujah so we see it from the the uh
[19:29] text plainly the devil will uh give
[19:31] people the preachers they want to help
[19:34] them to compromise and enjoy the
[19:36] pleasures of sin but also have an idea
[19:38] about the manner of the message or a
[19:41] manner of Jesus they know the manner of
[19:45] Jesus but they don't know
[19:48] Jesus does that sound familiar Matthew 7
[19:51] they say Lord Lord Jesus said many will
[19:53] say Lord Lord did we not prophesy did we
[19:55] not cast out devils and done many
[19:56] wonderful Works he said I never knew you
[20:00] look they knew they knew the manner of
[20:02] the Holy Spirit they knew how to cast
[20:04] out Devils prophesy do many one they
[20:06] knew the manner for Supernatural but
[20:08] they didn't know Christ Ah that's what
[20:10] we need today we need men and women that
[20:12] know Jesus Christ
[20:14] Hallelujah they know the love for Christ
[20:16] the love for the word of God
[20:19] hallelujah but see God's looking for
[20:21] true worshippers so see Satan will
[20:24] always imit imitate true
[20:27] worshippers so see how Satan He he'll
[20:29] give them a partial fear of the Lord but
[20:32] not the full fear of the Lord and we've
[20:33] seen that amongst us as we as we said
[20:35] all the people that fall away so sad but
[20:38] of all the people that fall away uh they
[20:40] could be they could be genuine some of
[20:43] them are some of them we don't know but
[20:45] what what happens is Satan imitates
[20:47] repentance I've seen that I've told you
[20:49] many times people will cry over sin but
[20:52] it's only worldly sorrow because they
[20:53] got caught but the next day they go out
[20:55] and do the same thing they cried about
[20:57] the day before there's no real change
[21:00] there's no real repentance there's no
[21:01] hatred for sin right see and that's
[21:05] what's happening here they have a form
[21:07] of there it is a form of godliness but
[21:09] they're denying the power thereof that's
[21:13] Hallelujah see Satan can imitate uh
[21:17] right he can imitate the True
[21:20] Believer they're false Christ they have
[21:23] the right anointing they have the Christ
[21:25] anointing to do works but when they're
[21:27] not under that anointing they're living
[21:28] a false life they're living in iniquity
[21:30] praise God yes remember Hezekiah was
[21:33] king of Judah Judah was the southern
[21:35] part right Samaria now if I'm looking at
[21:37] you guys Samaria was a Northwestern up
[21:40] there if I'm not mistaken I have to get
[21:42] out my Israel map
[21:44] here but remember the northern countries
[21:46] of Israel had all been taken away and so
[21:49] in this section of of Samaria uh the
[21:51] Syrian King filled it in with heathens
[21:53] right but there was still a faithful
[21:54] Remnant praise God there was still a
[21:56] faithful group down there in the south
[21:58] Southern Judah praise God God gave him a
[22:01] faithful King by hezekiah's name
[22:03] Hallelujah I always loved him because he
[22:05] started at 25 I started ping at 25 so I
[22:07] love I always love Hezekiah when I get
[22:09] over there brother brother uh uh Patrick
[22:12] I'm GNA tell him your testimony meant
[22:13] something to me and it did when I first
[22:15] became a pastor I preached on Hezekiah
[22:17] because I was like wow he's 25 I'm 25
[22:19] I'm gonna tell Hezekiah you meant a lot
[22:20] to me
[22:21] brother when I needed Hezekiah he was
[22:24] there amen the word of God about
[22:26] Hezekiah was there Hallelujah
[22:29] that's
[22:30] right now church we can see here now we
[22:33] get to the second state they didn't fear
[22:36] God and now they fear God to a partial
[22:41] amount but it's not the fear the loving
[22:44] obedience and church we we're going to
[22:46] read this chapter never read this
[22:47] chapter in your private life too never
[22:50] does it ever say they made sacrifices to
[22:52] God never does it say they kept the
[22:55] Feast of
[22:57] Israel so see they just they never
[23:00] really showed real repentance they never
[23:01] sacrificed Bullock or ax or goat or
[23:04] sheep they never did these sacrifices
[23:07] they just learned about the message but
[23:10] they didn't have the real heart for the
[23:13] message that's what we've seen a lot
[23:15] right people come in they try to live it
[23:17] for a while pretty soon they can't live
[23:19] it
[23:24] right they never really get the real uh
[23:27] experience with
[23:29] God verse 32 so they feared the Lord
[23:32] this is their second state and again
[23:33] finny recognized three states and made
[23:36] unto themselves of the lowest so yeah
[23:37] that was the priest
[23:39] yes so that was the second part they
[23:41] made themselves priests so they have to
[23:43] learn uh intellectually brother Ram said
[23:45] I've been listening to the Corinthians
[23:46] book of Correction by Brother Ram 1957
[23:48] what a it was a Bible study before
[23:49] brother Neville preached did you know
[23:51] that it was a real it was just like an
[23:52] hour nine
[23:54] minutes and uh brother B was talking
[23:56] about that he's like these Corinthians
[23:58] they just had an intellectual conception
[23:59] with God he said they were trusting in
[24:02] their prophecies they were trusting in
[24:04] their tongues they were trusting in
[24:05] their Sensations he said but a lot of
[24:07] them because they kept sinning and they
[24:09] didn't mourn over sin he said they just
[24:11] had an intellectual conception and
[24:13] that's exactly what's happening here
[24:15] these people they just have an
[24:16] intellectual con conception this is what
[24:18] I'm told the message is about this is
[24:21] what I'm told God uh is like but they
[24:24] never had God on the inside of them
[24:25] praise God hallelujah
[24:29] that's
[24:30] right so we see this second stage well
[24:33] now they'll fear God so they don't get
[24:35] killed by the the
[24:38] Lions and so Charles Spurgeon says look
[24:42] they were converted by
[24:45] lions I thought that was a really good
[24:48] thought Lions drew them to church in
[24:51] other words Lions drew them to the
[24:54] message and brother Charles finny said
[24:56] I've seen it in our church he said said
[24:58] a a family in the Church of England he
[25:00] said their child will pass away and
[25:02] that'll bring the dad into church and F
[25:04] he'll finally start serving God but if
[25:06] he comes for that reason alone then it
[25:08] wasn't a real conversion it's because a
[25:11] lion devoured his
[25:13] child brother BR talked about it brother
[25:15] you might remember this brother BR
[25:16] talked about people they only get uh
[25:19] experience in their intellects and he
[25:20] said they'll come to the altar can you
[25:22] stand up here brother
[25:23] CLA and uh brother R said they'll say oh
[25:26] you know your mother died she's in
[25:28] heaven don't you want to be with your
[25:30] mother and brother Ram said he saw
[25:31] preachers try to say you know get them
[25:33] emotionally worked up see if you want to
[25:35] go be with your mom you got to get right
[25:36] with
[25:37] God right and brother man said then they
[25:40] would serve God for a little bit then
[25:41] they'd Fall Away brother man said he's
[25:43] working on the wrong thing he's working
[25:44] on his emotions rather than the soul
[25:47] let's give our brother two claps since
[25:48] is Sunday night bless you he said he's
[25:51] working on here instead of down there in
[25:55] the soul that's right Hallelujah is that
[25:57] right
[26:00] so Charles Spurgeon sees this as a false
[26:04] conversion it's not a genuine conversion
[26:06] and again how do you know because they
[26:08] still allowed Idols in their
[26:11] lives right they only played message
[26:14] they only played church God help us we
[26:18] don't want to play church that's why
[26:20] that's why you're here tonight you don't
[26:21] want to play church I don't want to play
[26:24] church so the Lions converted them to
[26:27] change some of their
[26:30] Behavior we've seen it before too you
[26:32] know I can't remember but years ago I
[26:34] used to tell this testimony I can't
[26:35] remember now but somebody was dying I
[26:38] think it was in Lime I can't remember
[26:40] but they they they they told us if God
[26:42] heals us they'll serve God and God did
[26:45] some miracle there and they came to
[26:47] church for a while but eventually fell
[26:48] away and I remember telling my wife or I
[26:50] told somebody there I was like man God
[26:52] healed them and then they told God they
[26:55] served God and then they fell away what
[26:57] was it a lion conversion I'm going to
[27:00] die the lions are after me so yes I'll
[27:02] start to acknowledge God I'll get to
[27:03] know the manner of God but not have real
[27:06] love for
[27:08] God everybody see that everybody see
[27:10] that this is what we have we have a
[27:12] partial service to God not a complete
[27:16] surrender to
[27:17] God I've always loved this chapter it's
[27:20] always been always meant a lot to
[27:25] me now church can someone be saved by
[27:29] Terror I think the answer is yes Jude
[27:32] 1:22 and 23 qua I think the answer is
[27:35] yes I've used this
[27:38] before and of I'm sorry Jude uh 122 and
[27:42] of some have compassion making a
[27:45] difference see we don't we can't have
[27:47] compassion on everybody but we got to be
[27:48] led to have compassion on some
[27:51] people and others Sav with fear pulling
[27:56] them out of the fire eing even the
[27:58] Garment spotted by the flesh we get the
[28:00] picture of the Angels pulling lot out of
[28:04] Sodom some people are just going to have
[28:06] to drag them into church or some people
[28:08] you might you might save them that way
[28:10] and in that they might you know like lot
[28:12] they turn around or I'm sorry they
[28:13] didn't turn around the wife turn around
[28:14] but feeling the heat and feeling the
[28:17] destruction they had a a respect for God
[28:19] and they got
[28:21] saved so I want to let you know you know
[28:23] there's a balance on this so uh between
[28:25] the foolish virgins and the make
[28:27] Believers like Jud Judas scariot so
[28:29] Judas the scariot would have been one of
[28:31] these partial fear of the Lord because
[28:32] what' he keep he kept the idol of money
[28:36] the Bible said he was a thief in his
[28:38] heart right just like the Rich Young
[28:40] Ruler what was the one thing he wouldn't
[28:41] give up money his love for
[28:44] money right so there was one thing that
[28:46] always remained there in his life
[28:49] Judas he never gave money and the maybe
[28:52] the security of it and and not trusting
[28:54] in money the love of money he never gave
[28:56] that over to the Lord
[29:00] but we see here some people you might
[29:02] save with fear they might have a genuine
[29:04] oh God thank you for saving me and they
[29:06] might have love most often salvation
[29:10] comes by God showing his goodness to
[29:12] people and then they repent out of their
[29:15] love for Christ Romans 2:4 or desp
[29:19] despises thou The Riches of his goodness
[29:21] and forbearance and longsuffering not
[29:23] knowing that the goodness of God leadth
[29:26] thee to repentance amen see so I hope
[29:29] that was your case now Church you might
[29:30] have the other case but I hope it's your
[29:32] case now that you've served God the
[29:34] reason we serve God is because he's been
[29:36] so good to us amen amen no one's been
[29:39] better to me than God Almighty amen I've
[29:42] had some good friends some good Brothers
[29:43] good sisters I have good relatives we've
[29:45] had some good friends there in Ritman my
[29:47] we've had some wonderful friends there
[29:48] some of the finest friends you could
[29:50] ever ask for but nobody's been better to
[29:53] us than the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[29:55] and that's how God Saves people he
[29:57] showed them as goodness everybody
[29:59] remember the
[30:00] prodigal what caused him to leave uh the
[30:04] the pig pens of the world he remembered
[30:07] even my father wouldn't treat me this
[30:09] bad even if I just go to my father and
[30:12] say sorry surely he'll treat me better
[30:15] right the Devils treat me so bad but I
[30:17] know God he'll have mercy on me he'll
[30:19] have compassion on me
[30:21] Hallelujah so it was love it was the
[30:23] goodness of God my father's got a good
[30:25] heart the Heavenly father's got an
[30:27] eternity good heart
[30:30] Hallelujah and the Heart of the Father
[30:33] the goodness of God is expressed To Us
[30:36] by the Holy Spirit he's wooing us he's
[30:38] drawing us right he's drawing us unto
[30:40] him and therefore we can respond and we
[30:42] can run to the father again and again
[30:45] that's a good song we got to learn that
[30:46] song If we haven't yet learned
[30:51] it Allelujah so see the priests allowed
[30:54] this kind of a mixed
[30:56] life and as your pastor I'm not going to
[30:59] allow that by God's grace as far as I
[31:00] can't change what you you decide or I
[31:02] decide but I can preach the truth
[31:06] hallelujah do not mix the uh pleasures
[31:10] of this world with a Christian Life
[31:12] Hallelujah cannot mix them Hallelujah if
[31:15] you make a mistake confess it uh get it
[31:18] under the blood and serve Jesus Christ
[31:20] make Jesus Christ your joy and your
[31:22] passion
[31:23] Hallelujah do not mix uh a worldly life
[31:28] life with a real Christian Life
[31:30] Hallelujah like I told you before
[31:31] remember there was one family that they
[31:33] confessed to me later said every time
[31:34] our our worldly family came in we'd
[31:36] always skip church to be with them and
[31:40] the and then the individual confessed it
[31:43] to me and said it was
[31:44] wrong God never had first place oh Lord
[31:47] I hope everybody looks at their heart
[31:48] tonight does God have first place in
[31:50] your heart is God your number
[31:54] one above anything that's what we need
[31:58] need today Hallelujah we need a heart
[32:01] that's fully surrendered to
[32:03] Christ amen
[32:06] hallelujah so the preachers allow them
[32:08] to live in this uh it's a double life
[32:11] I'll say it like that church you don't
[32:13] want to lead lead a double life you'll
[32:15] you'll you'll live with condemnation
[32:18] guilt uh all the all the attacks of the
[32:22] enemy you'll never have any real love or
[32:24] Joy or Freedom or Victory God gives us
[32:27] so much freedom and victory it ought to
[32:29] be a joy to come to the house of God and
[32:30] praise God
[32:32] hallelujah as a pastor I get nervous
[32:34] when people won't praise the Lord right
[32:36] like what's their life I'm told to watch
[32:37] over the souls
[32:40] amen like one time I you know I said uh
[32:43] this I never heard a certain brother say
[32:45] Amen uh for years I never heard I never
[32:47] seen the brother come up for prayer and
[32:49] turned out he ended up leaving the
[32:50] message he never had a real experience
[32:53] with God and then I found out later he
[32:54] would watch all these NBA basketball
[32:56] games I mean come on waste three hours
[32:59] then you can't pray you know you can't
[33:01] uh come up for prayer I mean what that
[33:03] that that's called making love to the
[33:05] world that's loving the world you can't
[33:08] love God in the world either love one or
[33:11] hate the other is that right we got to
[33:14] love God the righteousness of Christ
[33:16] amen let's love God with all of our
[33:18] hearts amen
[33:20] hallelujah so these these people in
[33:23] Samaria they never got real repentance
[33:25] they never got a real confession of sin
[33:29] they never kept all the word of God
[33:31] remember brother man said what' he say
[33:32] the evidence was church he said the
[33:33] evidence of the Holy Ghost was what in
[33:35] the word all the way that's what he says
[33:38] in the church age book now I believe
[33:40] it's all the words so I believe it's
[33:41] fruits of the Holy Spirit yes you'll
[33:43] have gifts yes you'll have a life free
[33:44] from sin it's all that it's all the word
[33:47] right yes you'll believe the message for
[33:48] your day the message for your day is
[33:50] bring forth fruits right it's harvest
[33:52] time right you'll have all that
[33:55] Hallelujah and we got to have all that
[33:58] but that's a real life that's in the
[33:59] word all the way brother R said you
[34:01] always have something in your heart
[34:03] saying Lord I want to do something for
[34:05] you so what are you doing that's a good
[34:08] question right what are you
[34:10] doing what are you doing for the Lord
[34:13] that's the question we got to ask
[34:14] ourselves
[34:15] tonight what are we doing for the Lord
[34:18] who am I helping am I a hero for the
[34:21] Lord let's be that by God's
[34:24] grace let's be
[34:26] that
[34:28] Hallelujah I liked what
[34:32] um I like what Spurgeon said he said if
[34:36] we do not worship God alone then we
[34:39] worship no God at
[34:41] all talking about the true God it's a
[34:44] it's quite a good statement I love
[34:45] Spurgeon he's he's gifted brother and
[34:49] he'll always be a preacher right brother
[34:50] manam said whatever you are in this life
[34:51] you'll be that in the next life so he'll
[34:53] be giving us nuggets in heaven brother
[34:55] my goodness brother Spurgeon Hallelujah
[35:00] see God wants all worship that's the
[35:02] only kind he takes that's right and it
[35:05] was proven as Spurgeon said it was
[35:07] proven in the temple of deeon remember
[35:09] they put the Ark of the Covenant in
[35:10] there what happened the gods fell down
[35:12] there was all kinds of gods in there and
[35:14] as long as God wasn't in there all the
[35:16] gods could exist but when God came in
[35:19] there he cast them down that's right
[35:21] that's what happens in your life if God
[35:23] comes in your life the idols will come
[35:24] crashing down Hallelujah because God
[35:27] can't stand God won't put up with a
[35:29] partial service to God a partial life
[35:32] Liv for God God wants your whole life
[35:34] are the children hearing me too by God's
[35:36] grace we want them to know it from a
[35:38] young age by God's
[35:40] grace God wants the full worship
[35:44] Hallelujah that's
[35:46] right when God comes in he shames every
[35:50] Idol As we sing that song He shames
[35:52] every Idol Hallelujah He reigns without
[35:54] rival our Jehovah Hallelujah
[35:59] now we go down to verse 33 now we get to
[36:02] the third and final
[36:05] condition first they didn't fear
[36:08] God second they begin to fear God but
[36:11] it's only a beginning they don't go all
[36:13] the
[36:15] way so they saw all these lions killing
[36:17] all their loved ones like oh God we we
[36:19] better learn to fear God but once the
[36:21] Lions left then they started going to
[36:22] this next mixture they feared the Lord
[36:26] and they served other gods so they
[36:30] stopped the burning of the children but
[36:33] they still would go out and make
[36:34] sacrifices to the
[36:37] idols they went as far as they could go
[36:40] without the Lions there to kill
[36:44] them well as long as I can get away with
[36:47] a little bit that's what I want to get
[36:49] away with as a Christian we don't want
[36:50] to get away with any sin we want God to
[36:53] spank us when we make a mistake right we
[36:54] want God to correct us amen hallelujah
[36:57] amen Lord don't let me get by without
[36:59] correcting me correct me if you love me
[37:01] you'll correct me praise God hallelujah
[37:04] amen is that
[37:06] right so now we see the third and this
[37:09] is the worst condition the third and
[37:11] final this is the worst
[37:14] condition like the Bible said it' been
[37:16] better for Judas not to be
[37:19] born than to be born to know the truth
[37:22] and then fail to walk in it so these
[37:23] people are like Judas the scar they're
[37:26] like the uh the people people that had
[37:27] Miracles but they kept living in
[37:31] iniquity right they had a partial
[37:33] anointing but not the full anointing to
[37:37] live a life that pleases
[37:39] Christ
[37:42] Hallelujah so that's how we apply it to
[37:44] the New Testament right we got to find
[37:46] some new testament examples what is a
[37:48] where's a false conversion in New
[37:49] Testament Matthew 7 Judas
[37:53] scariot right they learn to fear God in
[37:56] a little minor way but they don't fear
[37:58] God all the way with loving
[38:04] obedience
[38:06] Hallelujah they feared the Lord and
[38:08] served their other gods after the manner
[38:12] of the Nations whom They Carried Away
[38:13] from then Charles Spurgeon said no in in
[38:17] his time of life there was no country
[38:19] greater than England he said because he
[38:22] used this verse about the
[38:24] Nations he said no country has more of
[38:26] the gospel and look they had the they
[38:28] had the uh the the sanctification
[38:30] message right because John Wesley lived
[38:32] in the 1700s Spurgeon was
[38:34] 1800s they had the sanctification
[38:36] message he said there's no uh greater
[38:39] Church in all the world than in England
[38:40] as far as God has just gave them a
[38:42] Revival through John Wesley and he was
[38:44] trying to keep the revival going he said
[38:47] but I found I I find our greatest Idol
[38:49] in England is alcoholism
[38:54] drunkenness now what did Brother Ram say
[38:56] is americaas you remember what brother R
[38:57] say
[39:00] entertainment I'm going to say that
[39:01] again what brother Ram say entertainment
[39:03] the church
[39:05] said so there's what
[39:08] drunkenness physical drinking alcohol
[39:11] getting drunk in fact Spurgeon said one
[39:13] man I know he said he said I feel most
[39:15] spiritual when I have four or five
[39:16] glasses of alcohol in me then I can
[39:18] finally talk about God Spurgeon said you
[39:20] are not a
[39:22] Christian
[39:24] right you're not a Christian if you need
[39:27] that to talk talk about God in fact we
[39:28] have a friend that that's how her mom's
[39:30] like her mom will only talk about God
[39:31] when she's Saed drunk I think the word
[39:34] is for so sad so
[39:37] sad and that that that's the hypocrisy
[39:40] of that woman she'll only talk about
[39:41] Jesus when she's drunk but everybody
[39:43] knows Christians don't get drunk on
[39:45] natural wine they get drunk on spiritual
[39:46] wine hallelujah praise God they love God
[39:49] they worship God that's when they get
[39:51] drunk on the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[39:54] amen and so what what do people I'll say
[39:57] like this what do message people in
[39:58] America get drunk on
[40:02] entertainment
[40:04] Hallelujah I can hear it's quiet I
[40:06] understand that but church we have to
[40:09] all examine Our
[40:11] Lives
[40:14] entertainment anything that pulls away
[40:16] your love and devotion for God you just
[40:18] try to entertain
[40:20] yourself that's the God of this evil age
[40:23] at least in America at least right now I
[40:26] said at least because there is a
[40:27] persecution coming a minor one brother
[40:29] Ram
[40:30] says in other words there's a squeeze
[40:33] coming down where we're going to be able
[40:34] to see we're going to see the United
[40:35] States government changing its
[40:37] laws right we're going to see them
[40:40] brother M said remember remember there's
[40:42] I have five I made a video last week uh
[40:44] there's at least five verses God's
[40:45] trying to fulfill not all scriptures are
[40:48] fulfilled that's why the Rapture hasn't
[40:50] happened but one of them is revelation
[40:52] 13:16 can we pull that up there hun
[40:55] brother Braham says I believe according
[40:56] to revelation 146 the bride will be
[40:59] forced to stop preaching the word of God
[41:01] before the
[41:03] Rapture so he calls his all both small
[41:05] and great rich and poor free and bond to
[41:06] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[41:08] their foreheads brother Ram says this
[41:10] the causing alls this is the squeeze
[41:12] when the Beast system starts getting
[41:14] ready to lay down its Mark and they say
[41:16] you can't preach anymore brother Jesse
[41:18] then we should know the rapture's on
[41:21] it's time for the squeeze right it's
[41:23] time to get ready for the latter rain
[41:24] Hallelujah now we should be ready for it
[41:26] at all times because brother man said it
[41:28] could happen in just a matter of hours
[41:30] right just like uh Jesus's arrest uh
[41:33] crucifixion and and death burial
[41:35] Resurrection all those scores of
[41:37] scriptures were fulfilled in a matter of
[41:39] three or four days right is that right
[41:43] Hallelujah that's what we see in the
[41:45] word of God we got to be ready
[41:47] Hallelujah at any time we must have our
[41:50] our devotion fully given to the
[41:53] Lord we must have our lamps trimmed and
[41:56] clear
[41:59] Hallelujah so the third and final worst
[42:02] condition was they fear the lord to some
[42:04] degree but they let the idols remain in
[42:07] their
[42:08] lives the cares of this world Jesus said
[42:13] and then remember he said eating and
[42:14] drinking like the days of
[42:15] Noah right all these things that's what
[42:18] we're battling entertainments right
[42:20] cares of the world keeping our minds
[42:22] focused on the
[42:24] Lord look at verse 34 unto this day they
[42:28] do after the former manners they fear
[42:31] not the Lord so isn't it it's almost
[42:34] like a contradiction in verse 33 said
[42:36] they feared the Lord but then verse 34
[42:39] says they didn't fear the
[42:41] lord see because God doesn't count a
[42:44] half-hearted effort as fear of the Lord
[42:46] hallelujah amen
[42:50] glory so it says they fear the lord that
[42:52] means to some
[42:53] degree but they still let the idols
[42:56] exist in their life and so then God says
[42:59] well they fear the lord but they didn't
[43:00] really fear the lord does everybody
[43:02] understand they had a partial fear of
[43:05] God but not a total fear of
[43:09] God all
[43:11] right appreciate everybody staying with
[43:13] me they fear not the Lord neither do
[43:16] they after their Turn the Page in my
[43:18] scofi Bible statutes or after their
[43:21] ordinances or after the law and
[43:23] commandment which the Lord commanded the
[43:24] children of Jacob whom he named Israel
[43:26] so see they didn't keep all the
[43:28] commands they just kept some of them
[43:31] that okay this is the way God kind of
[43:33] works in your life right so sisters you
[43:36] just kind of want to have long hair kind
[43:39] of want to wear skirts Brothers you just
[43:41] want to try to be a nice guy all the
[43:42] time
[43:44] and now the Bible don't say the nice
[43:46] inherit the kingdom of God the Bible
[43:48] said those who are born again inherit
[43:49] the kingdom of God Glory
[43:53] Hallelujah see they only get part of the
[43:55] word they don't get a full fear of the
[44:00] Lord verse
[44:03] 35 with whom the Lord had made a
[44:06] covenant in charge them saying ye shall
[44:07] not fear other gods nor bow yourselves
[44:10] to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to
[44:14] them
[44:16] Hallelujah verse 36 but the Lord who
[44:19] brought you up out of the land of Egypt
[44:21] with great power and a stretched out arm
[44:23] him shall ye fear and him shall you
[44:25] worship and to him shall you do sacrif
[44:27] oh I love this point Spurgeon brought
[44:28] this out no wonder they couldn't worship
[44:31] God these these these uh Babylonians
[44:34] that moved in no wonder they couldn't
[44:36] worship God because they've never been
[44:38] brought out of Egypt Glory Hallelujah
[44:41] how many can say God brought you out of
[44:43] Egypt hallelujah amen God saved my soul
[44:46] God brought me out of captivity to sin
[44:48] I've been through the waters I've been
[44:50] baptized hallelujah amen I've ate the
[44:52] Mana of the word hallelujah I know it's
[44:55] like to be in Egypt he brought brought
[44:57] me out of the my clay he set my feet on
[44:59] a rock to St Hallelujah brother William
[45:02] he puts a song in my soul today
[45:06] Hallelujah that's why these people
[45:07] didn't fear God they hadn't been
[45:09] delivered by God but if you've ever met
[45:11] God if you've ever been delivered by God
[45:13] you can't help but fear Him and love him
[45:16] with loving obedience
[45:19] hallelujah
[45:23] hallelujah glory to God Amen
[45:27] woo I love this this beautiful chapter
[45:28] to me amen uh to me it's the word
[45:31] becoming
[45:32] real this is jump to me this jumps off
[45:35] the pages and now I can see uh partial
[45:38] Believers in the message right or
[45:41] denominational churches they got a
[45:43] partial fear of God but they don't serve
[45:46] God all the way it's because they've
[45:48] never really come out of Egypt they
[45:50] didn't experience what you and I
[45:54] experienced Hallelujah that's why
[45:56] brother said if someone wants to get
[45:58] re-baptized he said go ahead and let
[45:59] them just give them an just he said make
[46:03] sure they have a conscience that I've
[46:05] come out of Egypt
[46:06] amen some of our young children might
[46:08] grow up and they might feel like well
[46:09] maybe I need to be re-baptized guess
[46:11] what I'll be right there to re-baptize
[46:12] them because whatever they need for
[46:14] their conscience to be true with God
[46:16] we're going to do it by God's grace they
[46:18] need to know that they know that they
[46:20] know that I was lost but now I'm found
[46:23] Hallelujah I was blind but now I see
[46:26] Hallelujah amen I was a rich but God's
[46:29] Amazing Grace came and rescued me
[46:31] hallelujah amen is that right sister
[46:33] Anna Hallelujah I like that smile you
[46:34] got on your face there Hallelujah I know
[46:38] it's like God brought me out of the my
[46:39] clay Hallelujah he brought me out of
[46:42] Egypt I was there and happened amen I
[46:45] was led by the prophet of God I was led
[46:47] by acts 238 amen I was brought out of
[46:50] the my clay Hallelujah I was there and
[46:52] it happened I ought to know praise
[46:55] God but these people now they were just
[46:57] kind of planted in there they didn't
[46:59] have the same experience that God's
[47:01] people
[47:04] had and I even remember one of these
[47:06] brothers that's left the message he said
[47:08] his mom forced him to be baptized in the
[47:09] name of the Lord Jesus Christ at the
[47:11] Bram Tabernacle and he said he fought it
[47:13] all the way down then he ended up
[47:15] turning away from the message and he
[47:17] told me to my face he said I don't think
[47:18] the Lord Jesus Christ baptism is right I
[47:20] think fathers and Holy Ghost is
[47:22] okay so what do we need we need each
[47:25] person to have a genuine experence I
[47:27] want to be baptized because I want to
[47:29] die to myself and I want Christ to live
[47:31] in me praise God that's what I want I'm
[47:35] worthy of hell I'm worthy of death my
[47:37] sins is what nailed to the cross but his
[47:39] life and his mercy and his forgiveness
[47:41] and his blood now comes upon me and I
[47:44] can live a life of Christ Hallelujah
[47:46] because he died for my
[47:50] sins Glory how many want that kind of a
[47:54] pure heart right there can we see the
[47:56] beautiful uh Revelations from this
[47:59] chapter there's so much connection to
[48:01] our life people just get they move into
[48:04] the message or they just move into a
[48:05] church and they just try to act like
[48:06] everybody else like pretty soon you
[48:07] learn how to you I learn how to sit and
[48:10] I I I learn how to say how you doing I
[48:12] learn how to say I'm pressing the
[48:13] battles like everybody else are you
[48:15] pressing the
[48:17] battles right right right right brother
[48:19] Mercy he's laughing yeah I I learned
[48:21] right away how to act around message
[48:23] people just be nice and night just be
[48:25] nice right just say oh I'm doing okay
[48:28] praise God and that that's it you know
[48:30] just got to shake a few hands and you
[48:31] can leave but where's the real Spirit of
[48:34] Christ that wants to care for your
[48:36] brother and sister right where's that
[48:38] real the real heart to serve your your
[48:41] family praise
[48:43] God
[48:45] hallelujah talking about real religion
[48:47] here about God's grace religion is a
[48:48] good thing when it's
[48:50] pure so they had false religion they had
[48:52] an impostor religion they only obeyed
[48:56] some of God's commands but they still
[48:58] enjoyed all of their idolatry well
[49:01] partial idolatry they still served other
[49:04] gods and so they fear the lord but God
[49:06] said you really don't fear
[49:09] God they had a terror of the Lord but
[49:11] not a real love for the
[49:14] Lord
[49:17] hallelujah verse 37 and the statutes and
[49:19] ordinances and the law and the
[49:20] Commandment which he wrote for you you
[49:22] shall observe to do forever and you
[49:24] shall not fear other gods verse 38 and
[49:26] the Covenant that I have made with you
[49:28] ye shall not forget neither shall ye
[49:30] fear other gods so because you're a
[49:32] covenant people you don't fear the world
[49:36] you don't fear other gods because God
[49:38] made a promise to each one of us God
[49:40] made you and and I a promise God brought
[49:43] us into the Covenant so we do not fear
[49:45] other gods Hallelujah we do not fear
[49:48] what man shall do to us because God has
[49:51] joined us into the Covenant Hallelujah
[49:55] remember the Bible said Moses sprinkled
[49:56] blood on them remember he sprinkled
[49:58] blood and the he said I'm sprinkling you
[50:00] because now this represents I'm joined
[50:02] and Peter says you're sprinkled with the
[50:04] blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah praise
[50:06] God Amen so when you obey the word of
[50:09] God and God convicts you and you obey
[50:11] the holy spirit it's like you've been
[50:12] sprinkled now I'm walking in obedience
[50:14] now I've been baptized now I'm getting
[50:16] Sanctified and pretty soon that
[50:17] sprinkling comes into your soul it's a
[50:19] baptism of the Soul praise God so you
[50:22] start with the sprinkling but then the
[50:24] baptism comes into you sometime later
[50:26] praise God am the baptism of the Holy
[50:28] Ghost is that right Peter said that
[50:31] you're sprinkled you're joined to the
[50:33] Covenant when you start obeying the word
[50:35] of God but you have to have a baptism of
[50:37] the Holy Ghost
[50:39] Hallelujah that's right now I'm looking
[50:41] back to the word I'm almost done here
[50:42] I'm not sure when I
[50:45] started
[50:47] Hallelujah verse 39 but the Lord your
[50:50] God ye shall fear and he shall deliver
[50:53] you out of the hand of all your enemies
[50:56] what a promise church if you just love
[50:59] God if you just love God all the days of
[51:00] your life he'll deliver you out of every
[51:03] trial I can ask my wife and say Lord say
[51:06] darling has the Lord delivered us out of
[51:07] every trial yeah every
[51:11] trial brother William has the Lord
[51:13] delivered you out of every trial
[51:15] Hallelujah does God keep his
[51:18] word see if we fear God if we take the
[51:20] right approach to God if we have love
[51:22] for God he's going to back us
[51:24] up he's going to fight our battles for
[51:27] us amen
[51:29] hallelujah God promised if we give him
[51:32] all of ourselves he'll give all of him
[51:34] to us hallelujah oh my what a blessing
[51:37] Hallelujah I hope somebody's ready for
[51:38] communion praise
[51:40] God hallelujah glory to
[51:46] God now look at the sad State as we
[51:48] close this look at the sad
[51:54] State verse 40
[51:57] how beit they did not hearken but they
[51:59] did after their former manner so they
[52:03] got a a little bit of cleaning up they
[52:05] clean up a little bit out of their lives
[52:07] until the Lions went away but then as
[52:09] soon as they weren't afraid of the Lions
[52:10] anymore they well I can try a little bit
[52:12] of this I can go a little further with
[52:14] this and pretty soon God just let them
[52:16] he didn't send the Lions anymore because
[52:18] that's what they wanted right read it
[52:21] the Bible never says he sends Lions
[52:23] again right God will give the God gives
[52:26] warning before judgment
[52:28] right he doesn't say how much he's going
[52:30] to give us the warning but here they got
[52:31] a warning after a while they just got
[52:34] kind of cold on God and they go back
[52:37] right doing the same things they did but
[52:39] they had an understanding about God they
[52:41] knew the manner of
[52:44] God that's what they did verse 41 so
[52:47] these nations fear the lord and serve
[52:49] their graven images both their children
[52:52] now look how sad this is this is what
[52:54] happens in the message
[52:57] right if you get grandparents right or
[53:00] you get a couple that doesn't serve God
[53:02] or they serve God partially what happens
[53:04] then their children just serve God
[53:05] partially and church it always gets
[53:06] worse in the second generation if they
[53:08] don't have a genuine experience with
[53:10] God right and then those children have
[53:13] children and now it's three generations
[53:16] later and they're doing the same things
[53:18] they did at the beginning same sins so
[53:21] these nations fear not the Lord and
[53:22] serve their graven images both their
[53:24] children and their children's children
[53:25] as did their fathers so they do unto
[53:28] this day but thank God God had a little
[53:30] group of people there who are having
[53:31] Revival Hallelujah Hezekiah brought them
[53:34] in to Revival praise
[53:36] God now Church you know what we need we
[53:40] we we need to know more than the manner
[53:42] of God well you know God's kind of like
[53:44] this and God kind of did this to brother
[53:45] brandham you know God kind of worked
[53:47] with brother Bram like this we need to
[53:48] know more than that we need to know more
[53:50] than the manner of God we need to know
[53:52] the heart of
[53:54] God that makes all the the difference
[53:57] these people were not after the heart of
[53:59] God they just want to know about God so
[54:01] I don't get into trouble I can still
[54:03] have my pleasure filled
[54:05] life how can I uh avoid you know the
[54:09] Lions of this world and still uh kind of
[54:12] respect God but then still enjoy the
[54:14] pleasures of sin that's what their minds
[54:17] were on our mind should be on how much
[54:19] sin can I get rid of praise God and how
[54:22] much righteousness can I can I live for
[54:25] Christ and this this went from
[54:27] generation to generation to the Next
[54:31] Generation how important it is for us
[54:32] parents right to live a life worthy of
[54:35] the
[54:36] gospel because our children are going to
[54:38] see how did Mom and Dad live
[54:42] hallelujah it's so
[54:44] important because our lives are going to
[54:47] be examples footsteps to the Next
[54:49] Generation praise
[54:51] God so we don't want false conversions
[54:55] church we don't want lions
[54:57] trying to convert US to follow the
[55:02] message we should have a heart that
[55:04] loves God and it should be the
[55:07] conviction of the holy spirit that comes
[55:09] upon us if we make a mistake God Lord
[55:12] forgive me convict me and then let me
[55:14] get my heart right with you may you be
[55:17] my joy may you be my song may you be my
[55:19] passion Hallelujah I don't want to mix
[55:21] anything with my pure love for Jesus
[55:23] Christ Hallelujah but that's what they
[55:25] wanted they wanted to mix the things of
[55:27] the world with the things of the
[55:30] message right so they mixed it and what
[55:34] they get they got
[55:35] Generations I'll say generations of
[55:37] vipers I might as well say that because
[55:38] that's what they were
[55:40] religious but not living the full word
[55:43] of
[55:44] God hallelujah so what do we see we see
[55:47] like I've been preaching on that's why I
[55:48] thought this was inspired too double
[55:51] mindedness right well I better do this I
[55:55] better do my and that's what Charles
[55:56] Vinnie said too sorry Charles Spurgeon
[55:59] he said there's so many people in our
[56:00] church they're just there for the ritual
[56:02] of it they just come to the ritual but
[56:05] as soon as they leave they go back out
[56:07] to their drinking or they gambling or
[56:09] they're smoking or whatever it is
[56:10] actually did you know he smoked one
[56:12] cigar every Sunday for the glory of God
[56:13] did you know
[56:14] that that's that man age they didn't
[56:17] have the full Revelation Martin Luther
[56:19] would drink alcohol and Charles Spurgeon
[56:21] it was I watched a video of his uh his
[56:23] weekly routine every Sunday uh I think
[56:25] it was on the drive home from the second
[56:26] service they had two Services every
[56:28] Sunday he said he would smoke a cigar to
[56:29] the glory of God that's what he said for
[56:31] the good of his health he died at 57
[56:33] church so let's not take that uh let's
[56:36] not take that
[56:37] literally
[56:39] okay they didn't know better in those
[56:41] days they didn't know was cancerous they
[56:42] didn't know these
[56:43] things God the Bible said God Winks at
[56:45] ignorance when you don't know but church
[56:47] we know we know we need to live a higher
[56:50] life but see the double-mindedness of
[56:53] these of these so-called message
[56:55] Believers or so-call Methodist so-called
[56:57] Baptist so-called
[57:01] Pentecostals they got their minds on the
[57:03] things of God boy we we went to some
[57:04] good Pentecostal Church man they can
[57:05] really remember we went to that big AC
[57:07] church over there boy no nothing against
[57:09] them but man they can really shout out
[57:10] they come really prayed and screamed and
[57:11] shouted when they walk away they got uh
[57:14] makeup rolling down their face they're
[57:15] walking away in their high heels you
[57:18] know walking away in their high heels
[57:19] like like they did something well what
[57:21] did you do what did you just do you just
[57:25] mixed religion
[57:26] with the cares of the world the love of
[57:28] the
[57:29] world Hallelujah and I hope God answers
[57:32] their prayers but what is it it's a
[57:33] mixture of Love of the world and some of
[57:35] the things of
[57:37] God there's going to be a people that
[57:40] are in the word all the way GL there's
[57:43] going to be a people that live by every
[57:45] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[57:47] God hallelujah brother Cam and I put out
[57:49] that podcast yesterday and that's the
[57:50] first scripture cam uh brought out the
[57:53] NIV says man shall not live by bread of
[57:56] alone and then that's it it cuts out
[57:59] live by every word that proceeds out of
[58:02] the mouth of God and you know I debated
[58:04] one of these guys on the debate I'll
[58:05] probably hear from him or hear somebody
[58:07] else I'm just going to delete their
[58:08] email because they they've shown their
[58:11] colors but he he used that in the debate
[58:13] he said uh he said you can't because I
[58:15] was using Matthew 4:4 we live by every
[58:17] word we got to be justified Sanctified
[58:19] filled with the Holy Ghost he said
[58:20] nobody can live by that now that was his
[58:22] time to talk and by the time it was my
[58:25] my turn I'd forgot to respond to that
[58:27] but see they take offense at that they
[58:28] don't want to give God all that they
[58:30] have but as Christians we should want to
[58:32] give God all that we have praise God
[58:34] that should be a joyful invitation yes
[58:36] I'll serve you with all my
[58:38] heart I I I I get to do every word of
[58:41] God and and the Bible makes it so easy
[58:42] the Bible said love fulfills all the law
[58:45] of God hallelujah it makes it so easy if
[58:48] you just love your neighbor as yourself
[58:50] love the church as yourself you fulfill
[58:52] all the
[58:53] law but that's what those new uh I'm
[58:55] going to on that again pretty soon the
[58:57] Bible I'm sorry the Bible translations
[58:58] man those are
[59:00] wicked oh my goodness I I can hardly
[59:02] stand it but but I I even told a brother
[59:05] this morning I said brother he said
[59:07] you're a cult of King James version I
[59:09] said I am no
[59:11] cult I said I got saved in the NIV
[59:15] Bible and the church
[59:17] said I'm not some cult starter I've
[59:20] always said it I'm gonna be respectful
[59:22] I'm respectful with that but I'm not
[59:23] gonna be respectful to the for the to
[59:25] the devil who's taking out words out of
[59:27] the Bible I'm preaching against the
[59:29] devil and the system not these people
[59:32] like that's what brother R said brother
[59:34] would blast denomination day in day in
[59:36] day night in Night Out day in day out he
[59:38] said but I'm not against the people I'm
[59:40] against that system that serpent that's
[59:42] biting the people hallelujah so that's
[59:45] what I am too by God's grace I'll still
[59:47] smile and say Hey you can read whatever
[59:48] Bible you want you could get saved out
[59:50] of there but you got to be careful it's
[59:51] taken away from the word of God you can
[59:54] still get saved in the NIV but if you
[59:56] really love God you want to go in God's
[59:58] word all the
[1:00:00] way have I warned anybody out tonight
[1:00:03] have I warn anybody out
[1:00:05] Hallelujah all right I'm going to try to
[1:00:07] finish up
[1:00:11] here so see Church the thing for us is
[1:00:15] that like I said with the foolish virgin
[1:00:16] this this is the issue with foolish
[1:00:18] virgin and the make
[1:00:20] believer because they both kind of
[1:00:22] engage in some of these uh partial
[1:00:25] message or partial truth but then they
[1:00:27] still have Idols in their life but we
[1:00:29] are assured of this first Corinthians
[1:00:32] 3:13 we are sure of this church God help
[1:00:36] us every man's work shall be made
[1:00:39] manifest God is going to show what
[1:00:40] everyone's work was all about their
[1:00:42] lives and their
[1:00:45] Ministry
[1:00:46] Hallelujah sometimes you wonder how did
[1:00:48] that brother do that why did that sister
[1:00:49] do that God's going to show it to
[1:00:52] us
[1:00:54] hallelujah for the day shall declare it
[1:00:56] what the day of the Judgment because it
[1:00:59] shall be revealed by fire the white
[1:01:00] Throne judgment and fire shall try every
[1:01:03] man's work of what sort it
[1:01:05] is verse 14 if any man's work abide
[1:01:08] which he hath built upon he shall
[1:01:10] receive a
[1:01:12] reward see Church we're either listen
[1:01:15] we're either building for the pleasures
[1:01:17] of the Lord or the pleasures of our
[1:01:19] flesh what are we building
[1:01:21] for what who we trying to be a hero for
[1:01:24] ourselves or for some somebody else see
[1:01:27] the day of judgment is going to manifest
[1:01:29] what was this all about the the the day
[1:01:31] of judgment will manifest why did I
[1:01:33] preach this gospel it'll manifest the
[1:01:35] sermon brother B said I'll be judged by
[1:01:37] the sermons I
[1:01:38] preached why am I preaching this so you
[1:01:41] and I can have pure
[1:01:42] religion so you and I will get rid of
[1:01:45] any Idol of our lives and have the true
[1:01:48] fear of the
[1:01:49] Lord
[1:01:53] hallelujah has anybody thought about
[1:01:55] that recently how many sermons have you
[1:01:56] heard on the fear of the Lord from other
[1:01:58] message preachers or just sermons that
[1:01:59] you is it a lot or very few what anybody
[1:02:02] can say it out loud a lot or
[1:02:04] few few that's what I thought I've seen
[1:02:06] few and yet the Bible says it's sister
[1:02:08] Lena it's the principal thing sister
[1:02:11] Lydia the fear of the Lord is the
[1:02:13] princip it's the most important
[1:02:15] thing where are our
[1:02:18] desires what's the and church I don't
[1:02:20] get wrong I love Miracles I I love to
[1:02:22] testify when people give us Miracles but
[1:02:24] that's what I feel like I feel like
[1:02:25] people are so into Miracles and and
[1:02:27] Supernatural just wanting to have some
[1:02:29] type of testimony they forget the part
[1:02:32] about the fear of
[1:02:34] God
[1:02:36] hallelujah the fear of the
[1:02:41] Lord we want both and I like I said I've
[1:02:43] seen it this year by God's grace I've
[1:02:44] seen Miracles I've seen it very thankful
[1:02:46] for God's
[1:02:47] grace I didn't I didn't read First
[1:02:49] Corinthians 3:15 if any man's work shall
[1:02:52] be burned in other words all of his
[1:02:53] preaching or all of his giving to the
[1:02:55] poor whor is burned up it wasn't done
[1:02:57] with the real fear of the
[1:02:59] Lord he shall suffer loss but he himself
[1:03:02] shall be saved so this is a foolish
[1:03:04] virgin this is not the samarit the the
[1:03:07] moved in Samaritans from Assyria in
[1:03:09] first uh 2 Kings 17 these are people
[1:03:11] that are saved so this is the lot this
[1:03:14] is the uh the foolish version that's
[1:03:16] saved right might be the Nicodemus or
[1:03:18] the Gia right think about that brother I
[1:03:21] just struck garia taught all those
[1:03:22] Jewish things but that's all going to be
[1:03:25] burnt but he could still be
[1:03:27] saved think about that you work 35 years
[1:03:29] and you can retire right that's what
[1:03:30] they tell us in America you know by the
[1:03:32] time I get up there it's going to be
[1:03:34] 45 I'm be 85 year old man come on kids
[1:03:36] let's do our Phonics work
[1:03:39] today come on let's clap I'll be having
[1:03:42] my uh what do they call those things
[1:03:44] cane I'll be walking there with my cane
[1:03:46] all right now let's dance and praise the
[1:03:47] Lord kids let me sitting down my cane so
[1:03:50] I can praise the Lord but think his
[1:03:51] whole life Gia as wise as he was it was
[1:03:54] all burned up he spent all those years
[1:03:56] teaching the law of the
[1:03:59] Jews it's all going to be burned up but
[1:04:02] yet he could be
[1:04:04] saved don't you want your life to count
[1:04:07] for something praise God don't you want
[1:04:09] to reward Peter Peter said what do we
[1:04:12] get Lord we've forsaken everything I Ed
[1:04:14] brother amen is that good example that's
[1:04:17] just like Peter amen's just like Peter I
[1:04:19] left my father's house what do we
[1:04:22] get Jesus said you get H hundredfold now
[1:04:25] and in in the life to
[1:04:27] come right we forsaken all what does God
[1:04:31] do he gives us all the blessings
[1:04:34] Hallelujah in this life and in the Life
[1:04:37] to Come
[1:04:39] Hallelujah sacrifice all for
[1:04:43] Christ it's a beautiful story and this
[1:04:46] is what we should want for our lives a
[1:04:48] life that has the true fear of the Lord
[1:04:51] hallelujah let's go to First Corinthians
[1:04:52] 10 I got a couple more scriptures I want
[1:04:54] to end with
[1:05:05] 1 Corinthians
[1:05:13] 10 verse
[1:05:19] 13 well now if you look at verses 1
[1:05:22] through1 13 this is all about Israel and
[1:05:24] Israel is another good example just like
[1:05:26] Judas and because many of them the Bible
[1:05:27] said died in the wilderness and they
[1:05:29] were lost God brought out a mixed
[1:05:31] multitude there it is amen there it is
[1:05:33] hallelujah the mixed multitude that's
[1:05:34] kind of what this Ser sermon is about
[1:05:36] the mixed
[1:05:37] multitude right some of them believe
[1:05:40] some of them didn't believe right some
[1:05:42] of them really praised God some of them
[1:05:44] just did it as a as a routine as a
[1:05:48] ritual right the Bible said they all
[1:05:51] drank the spiritual drink they all uh
[1:05:53] ate the meat the Mana they all got
[1:05:55] baptized in the water right they all
[1:05:56] went through these religious acts but
[1:05:58] not all of them had the fear of the Lord
[1:06:00] the love of God hallelujah only three
[1:06:02] right made it over other other than the
[1:06:04] ones that were 20 and under right Joshua
[1:06:07] Caleb and whose other one uh Joshua
[1:06:11] Caleb Miram didn't Miriam make it over
[1:06:14] no she didn't that's right she died okay
[1:06:16] two made it over plus all the 20 and
[1:06:20] under verse
[1:06:23] 13 there hath no temptation to taking
[1:06:25] you but such as as common to man but God
[1:06:28] is faithful I love those two words but
[1:06:31] God Church remember when you go through
[1:06:34] tests when you go through trials
[1:06:35] someone's been through this
[1:06:37] before you're not the only one who's
[1:06:39] ever battled this
[1:06:40] before I say like this but even greater
[1:06:44] the people that battled it overcame it
[1:06:46] by the same thing you can overcome it by
[1:06:48] Hallelujah the answer is the same for
[1:06:50] each and every one of us it's the love
[1:06:51] of God it's the charity amen
[1:06:55] doesn't the Bible say brother the love
[1:06:57] of God hides a multitude of sin I
[1:07:01] thought I'd hear a a louder shout on
[1:07:02] that one amen the love of God covers
[1:07:05] over a multitude of sin Hallelujah so we
[1:07:08] all go through the same similar trials
[1:07:10] but God is faithful
[1:07:12] hallelujah it's faithful to have
[1:07:14] communion with us even after we're going
[1:07:15] through trials and we might give into
[1:07:16] some of those trials we might give into
[1:07:18] some of those Temptations but God is
[1:07:20] still willing to have fellowship if
[1:07:22] we'll confess our sins and walk in the
[1:07:24] light as he's in the light
[1:07:26] God is faithful who will not suffer you
[1:07:28] to be tempted above that you're able
[1:07:29] lord I can't handle this this is above
[1:07:31] my pay grade no it's not is that right
[1:07:35] he won't test you above that you're able
[1:07:37] to Bear remember greater is he that's in
[1:07:40] you than he that's in the
[1:07:46] world but will with the Temptation also
[1:07:49] make a way to escape that you may be
[1:07:51] able to Bear wherefore my dearly beloved
[1:07:53] flee from idolatry
[1:07:56] see here he says it plainly Paul says it
[1:07:58] plainly a lot of our trials are just us
[1:08:00] being tempted by
[1:08:02] Idols right we're just tempted like like
[1:08:05] like Paul said a snare I'm brought into
[1:08:07] captivity so like there's a little trap
[1:08:09] and little by little we get a little
[1:08:10] closer well can I can I say this can I
[1:08:12] do that could I take that could I touch
[1:08:15] that could I could I say that and pretty
[1:08:17] soon they get trapped right but God
[1:08:21] always makes a way out praise God you
[1:08:23] don't have to stay there there's a way
[1:08:25] out of of Temptation there's a way out
[1:08:28] of sin it's called repentance amen
[1:08:31] hallelujah it's called trusting in the
[1:08:33] Living God
[1:08:35] hallelujah but notice dearly my he said
[1:08:37] my dearly beloved flee from idolatry so
[1:08:40] what got Israel all these things
[1:08:42] idolatry got them no matter all the
[1:08:44] spiritual acts they went through it was
[1:08:46] always idolatry that's what got these
[1:08:49] Assyrians in the Holy Land
[1:08:53] Hallelujah so remember Church what are
[1:08:55] some Idols that we got to
[1:08:57] overcome got to overcome the cares of
[1:08:59] this world in America you got to
[1:09:01] overcome
[1:09:04] entertainment so I like I like what uh
[1:09:06] brother Bram
[1:09:07] said we got to cast down entertainment
[1:09:10] for ourselves and he said we have to
[1:09:12] entertain Jesus hallelujah praise God
[1:09:16] Amen we got to entertain him and say
[1:09:18] Lord I Want To Worship You I Want To
[1:09:20] Praise You I want to listen to a sermon
[1:09:21] I want to read my Bible I want to pray I
[1:09:23] want to help somebody I want to call a
[1:09:24] saint I want to I want to be I want to
[1:09:26] Fellowship around the word of God
[1:09:27] hallelujah entertain
[1:09:31] Jesus right cares of the world
[1:09:33] entertainment brother Ram said sports
[1:09:35] figures right he said you can make your
[1:09:37] spouse an
[1:09:38] idol right you can make a car a piano he
[1:09:42] says so sorry buddy you can make you can
[1:09:44] make preachers
[1:09:46] Idols a lot of people do that like I
[1:09:48] told you uh the one person would say oh
[1:09:51] that brother's coming to town and then
[1:09:53] clean up their life but when the pastors
[1:09:55] preaching and they live a dirty life
[1:09:57] that's
[1:09:58] hypocrisy right that's idolatry I
[1:10:01] idolize that preacher in his gift more
[1:10:03] than any other preacher right but by by
[1:10:06] their fruits a person is
[1:10:07] known
[1:10:09] Hallelujah and of course money as we
[1:10:11] said the love of money is the root of
[1:10:14] all
[1:10:16] evil so let's stand to our
[1:10:19] feet musicians can
[1:10:23] come the partial fear of the Lord Lord
[1:10:26] is an awful state to be
[1:10:32] in there's a statement brother brandom
[1:10:35] says similar to this he said some people
[1:10:39] get only enough religion to make them
[1:10:41] miserable he said why would you only
[1:10:43] take enough religion to make you
[1:10:45] miserable he said why don't you get a
[1:10:46] religion that'll make you live that'll
[1:10:48] give you life and have it more
[1:10:51] abundantly praise God think about your
[1:10:53] life this week was it abundant in the
[1:10:55] grace of God do you feel like you were
[1:10:58] uh joying the abundance of God's love
[1:11:00] and the word of
[1:11:02] God that's what God offers to us the
[1:11:05] Abundant Life living in the Overflow
[1:11:07] praise
[1:11:09] God I'm living the Overflow of God's
[1:11:11] grace now I'm not talking about if
[1:11:12] you're going through a trial you might
[1:11:14] be but even in Trials you can praise God
[1:11:17] and you can feel God's presence in the
[1:11:19] storm how many understand that by God's
[1:11:22] grace let's bow our hearts here
[1:11:40] would you play that uh yeah you are my
[1:11:43] strength when I'm weak You're My All In
[1:11:45] All to these Assyrians in the Holy Land
[1:11:48] Jesus was not there all in all Jehovah
[1:11:50] wasn't there all in all we want God to
[1:11:52] be our all in
[1:11:54] all that's let's pray father God we
[1:11:56] thank you for the word of God tonight
[1:11:57] thank you for the attentiveness of your
[1:11:58] people they pull on the word of God they
[1:12:00] love the word of God they smile like our
[1:12:02] sister Anor there in the back lord God
[1:12:04] thank you that they love the word of
[1:12:07] God bless it to their hearts Lord if I
[1:12:09] say anything wrong you please pardon me
[1:12:11] Lord God you know the intents of my
[1:12:13] heart to help your people to feed the
[1:12:15] people the word of
[1:12:17] God lord we see in the scripture these
[1:12:19] people didn't want communion they just
[1:12:21] wanted to know about God but they didn't
[1:12:22] want to love God they didn't want to be
[1:12:25] a people after the heart of God but Lord
[1:12:28] we want to learn from that we want to be
[1:12:30] after the heart of God we want to be in
[1:12:33] the word all the way we want Jesus to be
[1:12:35] our all in all help us Lord when
[1:12:37] Temptations come when entertainment or
[1:12:40] cares of this
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:12:43] life or maybe it's pride of life and
[1:12:45] maybe it's lust of the eyes lust of the
[1:12:47] flesh Lord whatever may be Lord help us
[1:12:49] when these Temptations and snares come
[1:12:51] upon us Lord God may we escape them
[1:12:54] Hallelujah may we flee from
