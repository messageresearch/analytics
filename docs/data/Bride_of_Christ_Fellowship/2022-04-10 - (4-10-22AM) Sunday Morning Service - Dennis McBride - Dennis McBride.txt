against the world forward [Music] christians [Music] army who's the church of god [Music] what is [Music] [Applause] amen on what christian soldiers praise the lord during my time in the military that's one thing they have to teach us whenever you go in battle there's so much going on around you right you can't allow yourself to lose focus isn't that right no matter how hot and how heavy the battle becomes you got to stay focused hey man and we're in a battle right now aren't we amen it's not an easy life is it but we have god with us don't we and god is encouraging us even though you're going through everything that you're going through stay focused keep pressing on hold to the objective along with christian soldiers isn't that right man we might take a licking every once in a while but we have to get up dust ourselves off and keep going by the grace of on [Applause] amen we have a good example going before us hallelujah amen the chief captain amen amen god bless each one of you it's good to be here by god's grace amen and uh we pray that he meet with us and help us in his word it's been a little while since we've been here but every time we come it's a pleasure and to be amongst good saints and good fellowship and i wish i was able to sit down and hear brother jesse preach amen i thank the god for him and just his life and all so i don't want to keep you standing long so let's pray if we will amen heavenly father lord we thank you for allowing us to be here lord we are your people you know all about us you know exactly what we need and where we are so we just pray lord that you would please come in and just minister to our hearts minister to our needs lord sometimes we think we know what we need father but we don't really know at all so lord may you reveal to us lord give us what you know we stand in need of we pray lord we ask you and forgive us of our sins and our iniquities lord that's why we come here father is to get strength lord to keep moving forward as we were just singing lord to keep pressing the battle lord father we need you and we ask all these things humbly in your name the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen god bless you saints let's go in our bibles i'll keep the initial reading short and then we'll just kind of move as the lord would help us to move isaiah 57 and i want to go to verse 15. isaiah 57 and verse 15. this has become a very dear subject to my heart and i'm sure it is for all of us but it's just something that's really been emphasized to me here lately for my own good of course and but it applies to the whole body this is something that's very necessary for each member of the body to to be mindful of in our individual lives in order for god to be able to fully have his way so in isaiah 57 and 15 it says for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy he says i dwell in the high and holy place okay so god is speaking of a place that he abides right but now he's saying that i'm not there alone there's somebody that i'm actually with and this is the person that he's with he says with him also that is of a contrite and a humble spirit that's very important he says to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones let's just bow once more father help us lord we've read your word now bring it out as you will in jesus christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated saints and i'm gonna read this scripture once more because it's the the focal point of what we're going to be dealing with this morning 57-15 of isaiah again it says for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones also i want to go to first peter chapter 5 and verse 5. it says likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another you know within a world that we live in one thing i've noticed and i'm sure i'm not the only one you've probably encountered it also in your lifetimes many people have a problem with authority like everybody want to be a boss you know at work nobody want a manager over them they want to be able to do whatever they want to do and sadly to say but just you know many people have that that type issue where it's hard for them to be subject to someone else but the bible is saying here it says yea all of you be subject one to another you see now what is that really speaking about see because we're we're not talking about us humbling ourselves to a man per se right but there's a portion of god within each one of us isn't that right and god works through his body you know like for instance brother jesse is the pastor of the church and he didn't put himself in that role god put him there right so what god will do because he placed it because he placed him there and he put that gift in his life god will speak through him to each one of us isn't that right and sometimes god might give an instruction isn't that right but if we're not in the right space mentally i mean spiritually speaking we'll look at a man and we wouldn't want to as we would say obey what a man is saying not knowing that that's not that man but that's god veiling himself right and god can work through each member of the body in that way isn't that right god can speak through a child to an adult but if it's the voice of god then we must humble ourselves to him isn't that right but notice what it says on here it says and i like this part saints it says in be clothed with humility amen it says be clothed with it and that means you're wearing it like a garment and we want to get into what humility really is right let's be clothed with humility it says for god resisteth the proud right he says but he gives grace it says to the humble it says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god and then as a result of that it says he may exalt you in due time it's not us exalting ourselves but we actually wait on him and allow him to do in our lives whatever he wills at whatever time he wills to do it all right so as a subject this morning i wanna it presses us to limits and into places that are very uncomfortable yes sir isn't that right each one of us experienced that many of us might be going through that right now you know but it's all it's all for a purpose it's all it's all it's all serving a divine purpose with it's within each one of our lives god has to keep us or get us in a place right to where he can actually use us to his glory amen right now whenever now now god can't do that unless there's first of all a certain mindset that's there right a certain way to god that god has to help us to view ourselves right now just to kind of help delay a background here it says here in romans chapter 12 and verse 3. i'm talking about the place of power right in romans 12 and verse 3 it says for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you to right this is the holy spirit speaking through paul and he's addressing something to the entire church right there's some need for that god knew that you you have you have to keep this in mind because amongst man especially when you have a wrong nature very easily you can kind of get into a place to where you think more of yourself than what you should so god is encouraging his church through his his apostle and his prophet he says not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think he says but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith so god is not interested in us thinking more of ourselves than what we should all right there is something here i want to kind of bring in at this point that is a very key point that the lord allowed our prophet to make in a message called perfect strength and perfect weakness he says the important thing he says one of the important things that he says we must master all right now i know brother vang he he deals with the cnc machines right you know uh comparing to myself he would see he would be considered a master of of of the cnc machines and don't you also you run cnc machines right our brother austin he has a different type occupation but compared to me he's a master of his occupation meaning it's something that he's actually put time into to come to understand to the full extent of it and to perfect the craft of it isn't that right there's different people that hold different positions within here right but now whenever we have a job to do right we dedicate ourselves to that job we study what we need to study so that we can apply everything we need to apply to that job so that we can do it to the best of our abilities isn't that right so god is speaking through his prophet and he said all of us there's one thing we must master means you have to apply thought to it you got to meditate upon it it's something you got to keep in the foremost part of your mind it's something you can't lose sight of because it's something listen now this isn't just a man speaking to us this is god speaking his own thoughts telling us how he needs for us to operate and what place he needs for us to be in now what is this thing he's saying that we must master he says now remember this and especially you young preachers but not preachers only he says and lay members alike right he says here there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect this is the main key saints if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our life now how many want to know their purpose how many one of their purpose in the body of christ some of you might have a glimpse of it already you might say well man it seems like god want to use me in this way that way or the other and that very thing you might see or feel you see might be true right but in order for god to fully bring you into that position into that role into that purpose that you might be of benefit to the body because when god brings us into a purpose it's not just for us to kind of have some kind of a glory of our own you understand what i'm saying and that's the mentality god got to get away from us so when somebody is too desirous to do something you got to be careful of that because then what you can inject within that is your own human ability meaning you feel like i feel like i got what it take brother be it brother or sister i feel i got what it take to get this job over if you feel like you got what it takes you ain't ready yet to get into that position because in order for you to operate and that is god alone it has to actually operate through you you understand what i'm saying so the whole point is to yield to god and realize lord i can't do listen we'll just let the scripture speak for itself right in the in the book of john amen scripture we already know but it's for the sake of everybody let's just read it john 15 and verse 4. amen it says abide in me and i knew as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself right he says accept except it abide in the vine he says no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine and ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit he says for without me he can do how much so how many of us brought ourselves to church this morning let me see your hands how many how many of ourselves how many of us woke ourselves up this morning let me see your hands did your alarm wake you up if you did you can't hear an alarm can you so who enabled life to come inside of each one of us this morning that we might be able to wake up who is it that actually woke us up who is it that is enabling our eyes right now to be able to see the preacher up here right now are you causing yourself to see is it because of how many carrots you ate that's what they do right he cares to try to improve the site that's one way right you understand what i'm saying no you didn't do any of these things for yourselves and you never did our whole lives god has been the one blessing us with every day of our lives and every functioning part of our body has come from god but how many people wake up every day and feel like they're the ones that's in control of their own lives they woke themselves up they gave themselves food they give themselves money no god is the one you understand what i'm saying no matter what position you have as far as career-wise who gave you that job and even even for the job you have who who enabled you to comprehend what you needed to comprehend in order for you to be able to do that job that you do is it because you were so smart no god is the one that gives you the ability to understand and to do whatever it is in life that you can do isn't that the right sense so what's the real source of everything that we have it's god but many times we're not always mindful of that like we should be let's go to the book of daniel chapter four now i'm saying these things because this is something that's very important to god no matter where you are right now who you are right now this one thing has to become a foundation in every one of our lives but it's nothing that we have to make a foundation god is here to he's he's already working in that way i believe in our lives before we get done with this service i believe you'll understand why you go through all the things that you go through amen it's for a purpose now in daniel chapter 4 just to show an example of how important this is to god it says in verse 30 the king spoke now this is king nebuchadnezzar all right now all of our young people i know this is going to capture your attention all right it says the king spake and said is this now notice how the king is speaking this is king nebuchadnezzar king over babylon at this time the greatest kingdom in the earth won many victories amen a very flourishing kingdom amen very powerful king nobody could lay a hand to nebuchadnezzar you understand but nebuchadnezzar he did he he made he made a very very bad mistake notice this now listen to him in his mistake that he allowed the devil to bring him into and if we're not careful satan to come into every one of our lives and try to bring us into this same mistake it says the king spake and said is not this great babylon notice that i have built god allow us to have a little success of some kind and now all of a sudden we want to account it to being ourselves well i'm a pretty good i'm i'm a pretty good employee yo i'm a pretty good business owner i'm a pretty good electrician i'm a pretty good whatever pretty good that might be you understand what i'm saying and for that moment you're kind of glorying in something that that really you actually catching god attention is what you're doing because notice this now the king was saying this he wasn't saying this allowed per se this was just thoughts that he was having of himself in his own life his perspective that he came to of of how it is all these things came about that was taking place within his kingdom he says this great babylon he says that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power wow you know how many people were in the earth at this time there was millions of people in the earth at this time this king was saying there's all types of situations going on at this time that this king was saying this but because this king was saying this like he was saying it he drew the attention of god straight to himself watch this he says by the king he's by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty he says while the word was in the king's mouth so while he was sitting there saying all of these things while it was yet in his mouth it says there fell a voice from heaven see he thought he was somebody he was a king there was nobody in the earth at that time that could lay a finger on him his his word the bible says where the king with the word of a king in there is power his word had power you understand but now here it is he lost track he lost sight of who really was the source of everything that he had of whose power it was that established him in that kingdom who made him a king the bible says god says by me kings rule prince's rule and king's reign god sets up who we want to set up and he brings down who he wanna brings down and he doesn't take kindly to somebody all of a sudden feel like uh rather forgetting about him like that so the bible says while the word was yet in the king's mouth he wasn't even to finish and he was able to finish his thought completely a voice came down from heaven and what did that voice say saints o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from me so while he was giving himself honor and majesty and glory god had to come down and teach nebuchadnezzar a lesson you're glorying in yourself you feel like you did all of this oh it's your kingdom by your power i'm telling you right now i'm taking the kingdom away from you right now you are no longer king at this moment right wow you understand that sometimes god when we lose sight of who he is in our lives he'll come in immediately and he'll allow failures to take place why is he doing it though let's read on down while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying oh king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from me he says and then shall i watch you thought you were so you thought you were so mighty you thought you were so secure you thought because of your doings you're the one that's in this position in the way that you are but now i gotta teach you something never connected i got to show you that none of this is by your own power but it's by my power alone and to make sure you understand this not only am i telling you i'm taking the kingdom away from you i'ma let your own people drive you out see god really wanted him to understand something so i'm dethroning you nebuchadnezzar and i'm letting your own people drive you out of your own kingdom isn't that something saints and he comes on down he says and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field so not only am i going to drive you out from your own kingdom i'm gonna make you go out and live like an animal you're not gonna be able to go back to your path you right you gotta you got a palace that's right there nebuchadnezzar but by your own power you can't even walk back to your palace amen i'm keeping you from going back to your chambers and i'm gonna make you live out there with the animals day and night and not only am i gonna make you live with the animals i'm gonna make you eat like an animal you're not gonna be able to enjoy the grapes and the nice meats and things you were used to now i'm gonna make you kneel down on your hands and knees i'm gonna make you make your mouth go down and eat grass as the oxen god got a way of humbling a person you see he said he don't want nobody to think of to think of themselves above what they ought to isn't that right so why is god doing this god is doing this for his own good let's go on saints he says and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field and he says and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times will pass over thee until until thou know this is the main point until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will you got a little amnesia never but i have to deal with you to this extent to bring you out of that place that you've drifted into so that you come to this one understanding you ain't nobody my friend hey man i'm the one that gave you the position i'm the one that calls you to flourish it had nothing to do with none of your own abilities and our prophet taught us that we must master amen just so just so we don't lose sight of this there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it within our own intelligence or our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we got to get rid of the thing and lay aside so that god that god can use us he says that's right in order for god to use us we can't have no thoughts of our own selves in that way we can't think that that because i'm i'm so good at this or i have the ability to do this out of the up even down to the housewife hey man you can't have such a thought of yourself i'm such a good housewife who enables you to be able to cook like you cook right right huh is it because you can read or follow youtube videos so well or whatever you understand what i'm saying no it's god that enables you to be able to cook like you cook it's god that enables you to be able to be a homemaker isn't that right it's god that puts a desire in a man's heart to go out and work for his family you understand you understand what i'm saying every area of our lives depends completely on god and god wants us to understand this one thing so that we can be solely dependent upon him and when we're in that place that's the real place of power but we are totally depending on god lord you are the source of everything that i have and everything i ever will have and in that place right there that's when we can really be a benefit to one another because now it's not anything that's coming from a man's intellect or a man's free of failing abilities within himself but now there is a supply that's going to every part of god's body by the spirit of god from one member to another that's when we're able to come together brother and get straight from one another when god is in the midst of us of a humble people that's clothed with humility and able to flow through now your mind ain't your mind no more it's the mind of god now god is sitting there amongst us speaking life into each member of the body through the mouths of men that have been humbled before god and now god is able to have his way amongst his body that's what's taking place right now can we say praise the lord amen saints amen i like this amen this is such a blessing to my soul amen because i see the need of it praise the lord now let's go if we will to first corinthians chapter 12. first corinthians chapter 12. and i want to start at verse 1. because here's one of the men that throughout all time although there are many mighty and great when i say mighty and great me and brother jesse was talking about this the other day you know when we talk about somebody being mighty or great we're not exalting any man or woman right it's just people that have learned to yield to the spirit of god through the lessons that god has taught them in their lives and now god is able to show himself forth through each individual that's in that state and they're able to be a great help to other members of the body isn't that right so paul is one of these people right but notice god took paul through such lessons in life to bring him to a place let's just read here verse 1 says it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory he says i will come to visions and revelations of the lord i knew a man in christ above 14 years ago notice how he says this now he says i know he's i knew a man in christ and when i first started reading the bible and i read this for the first time i thought paul who paul talking who about this man he talking about here i mean he realized he was talking about himself but he was being so delicate in the way that he expressed these things because of the place that god had brought him to the last thing paul wanted to do is for any to cause anybody to think more of himself than what they should so out of a true heart of humility this brother was afraid to even mention that it was him that had these experiences he was so careful with his words he rather you think it was someone else amen you understand you know sometimes when please take this in the right way sometimes you know when certain things happen you know god might use you to do a certain thing and whatever you know sometimes i ain't saying it happens here but sometimes people can't wait to tell somebody what god used them to do let me tell you what happened brother i was such and such place man and a lo you know the lord used me to lay hands on this person and when i prayed for this person i'm telling you man a lightning flash and a thundercrack and man a light and they just got up here glory to god but in the bible now listen because christ don't change right right in the bible when christ would heal people you know one thing he would actually do he'll go to the person that he healed and he says see that you tell no man about it here he is god and whenever he did something he actually encouraged the person it was done to don't tell nobody about it the bible says he made himself of no reputation he said behold i am meek and lowly and hard you understand what i'm saying when god chose to manifest himself he made he manifested himself in a body that nobody could even they they had no thought that that was god housing that kind of a body why would he make a body for himself like that the bible says there was no beauty that we should desire he didn't make himself in a way to be very noticeable or seen like that but he was the kind that just kind of walked about in the shadows but yet he was god manifested in the flesh you understand what i'm saying so paul this same christ now he abides in paul and now he's caught he's brought paul he's molded paul to a place where paul knew he was nothing and he was very careful and how he communicated anything to make sure that one thing always was covered that he was not exalting himself and neither was he causing anybody else to exalt him in ignorance so this is why he's taking such care to make this statement like this amen he says i knew a man in christ above 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god noah he says such a one was called up to the third heaven he says and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god noah how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man not utter he says of such a one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory he's still talking about himself the whole time but this brother had entered he entered into this place of power he says but in mind infirmity so he said i'm not going to glory within the things that god has allowed me to experience but what i'm going to glory in is in my infirmities or my weaknesses because he understood now by god's grace what these weaknesses meant to his life how many of us have weaknesses now the devil has a way he wants us to view our weaknesses amen i'm gonna forerun myself a little bit i'm talking about the place of power right but i want you to understand that when you're in this place of power you don't feel powerful amen with that being said let's let's read this particular scripture here real quick i want to go to hebrews chapter 11. just to bring this in in this place of power that i'm talking about saints you don't feel powerful you don't feel that encouraged you might even feel discouraged amen you might even feel hopeless helpless amen but how many realize that's the exact place god need for you and i to be why because it's not by human ability it's not by your own powers not by your own mind it's not by your own intellect amen it's completely by his spirit amen he says not by pike nor by mouth but by my spirit saith the lord isn't that right it says here in hebrews and i want to come down for the sake of cutting the reading short the bible says here in uh let's go down to verse 32 it says and what shall i say more for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and barack and samson he says and of japheth and of david and samuel and of the prophets notice how it says this who through faith subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises it says stop the mouths of lions who was it that stopped the miles of lions how many would want to be in the place of daniel young people how many want to how many would want to be in the place of daniel but you were being let down in a lion's den huh i wouldn't put myself in that situation that's for sure uh-huh you know there's people you probably seen it on youtube before there's people that have gone and ignorance and their own ability want to be like daniel and they've actually gone to the zoo and jumped down into the lion's den proclaiming jesus christ but the lord didn't tell them to do that you understand what i'm saying they were just enthused read the story of the bible and want to go and be like daniel but daniel didn't put himself in that situation amen but because now listen the lord allowed daniel though to be put into that situation right but why because god was going to get glory out of that situation because daniel was totally dependent upon god dang listen daniel had become anointed daniel should have been screaming and kicking and and clawing for his life isn't that right but because of his position and in relationship with god he was trusting god's saints amen and he allowed himself to be bound up he allowed himself to be lowered down in there and the bible says it was by faith that the mouths of those lions were stopped but it wasn't because he was such a strong man see sampson was able to go and take a line and tear him apart isn't that right but that's not the anointing that was upon daniel but yet the anointing that was upon him allowed a power to be released that shut the mouths of the lions when you in this place of power you enable god to be able to move like that to bring about the supernatural in our lives in whatever way we might need we might stand in need of isn't that right amen he goes on to say amen women receive their dead raised to life again hey man remember the woman that was a widow woman not a widow woman she had a husband but she was barren back in the days of elijah isn't that right and that woman she desired a child and god acts you know is there anything that you need right and then he knew by god's grace she needed a child so god blessed her with a child isn't that right but after after a while the child got a little older than whatever and the lord allowed the child to die isn't that right and when that child died that woman was in a place of power you understand what i'm saying she knew there was nothing she can do about it but her mind went straight because she was anointed her mind went straight to the man of god and she took her child and laid her child down on the bed of the man of god and then she told her husband to go and cause one of the servants to come so he can go for a walk for ruin her and she went behind the servant they got in contact with elijah and elijah asked her he was like it's all well with these all well with the child even though her child was dead back in the bed of the prophet she said all is well right amen what was that saint she was anointed her faith was anointed she was depending upon god in a time of need amen and god by his grace moved through his prophet to go back with her and the life was brought back into her child again by faith women received their dad back to life again amen it says and others were tortured now notice what god made his people subject to it says others were tortured many people don't think that the children of god need to go through anything but why was god doing these things because he was working what what was necessary within each one of these individuals lives to bring them to a place of total dependency that he might get glory out of their lives praise the lord he says questify the the the the violence of fire escapes the earth the edge of the sword uh out of weakness when made strong it says wax valiant and fight and fight and turn to flight the armies of the aliens receive their dead women received their dead rays to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection it said and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment he says they were stoned these are the people of god now it says they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wanted about in sheepskins and goat skins isn't that something that's a very hard life to live isn't it but yet these were the people of god amen it says being destitute afflicted and tormented of whom the bible says the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and indians and in caves of the earth they didn't even have a decent place to stay now why would god allow all this to happen to his people it's because he was working within their lives and allowing to be placed within the past of their lives what was necessary to bring them to this place that we're reading of right now as we're able to read this here we're reading of the testimonies of the power and the grace of god that was working within these people's lives you understand what i'm saying there was something that needed to come to an expression but how could it have come to an expression unless these cases were there yes you understand what i'm saying so the unfortunate the things that that aren't so pleasing to us that take place in our lives god allows for every bit of it to be there what does it do it puts us into this place of total dependency and leniency upon him to allow his power to work in our lives so that the purpose that we he we are here for can be fully carried out it doesn't feel good amen it's not a desirous place to be but it's the very place of power that god needs for you and i to be in in order for him to get glory to himself and to really work everything according to his perfect will in our lives can we say praise the lord saints so i want to go back now to this particular scripture we read in isaiah 57. it says for thus saith the high and the lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place he says with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit he says to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones now what does that word contrite means i want to show it to you in the hebrew and then and then we'll bring it from webster's dictionary so the word contrite in the hebrew it means to be crushed it means to be dejected it means to be broken it means to be beaten to pieces it means to be humbled now we just read in the new testament he says yeah all of you be clothed with humility that place of humility listen saints we can't bring ourselves into that place there is a false humility that's in the land where people try to act humble but real humility is not an act it's a place of being you understand that it's a place that god brings each one of us to to where we know for for a fact listen that we are nothing you know who's the source of everything that you have you know who's the source behind any success you any true god given success you know he's the source and the reason behind it can we say praise the lord notice this now it means to be broken it means to be dejected it means to be beaten to pieces that's the hebrew definition of contrite so is is there something that god desires for you and i is that a state in place god desires for you and i to be in listen to this particular quotation here from time tested memorials brother branham says long years ago before they had the smelters they used to take the gold and and how they would know how it was right or not talking about the gold as they were working with it it says and all the sludge was out of it all the iron pyrite that's fools gold all the food was out of it it says beaters beat it and beat it and turned it and beat it and turned it until the beaters seen his reflection in the gold so as they were working with this gold there was a certain thing they were looking for and that enabled them to know that all of the dirt and whatever that was that was embedded deep within the gold was actually taken out of the gold the way our prophet said in one place he was saying how in order to draw that that that that dirt that had sunk way down into the the depths of the of this gold you know it had to be placed in in a very heated situation and the more heat that was applied it enabled the impurities that was embedded within the gold to begin to be broken loose at those deep stages and able to begin to travel its way up to the surface and when that impurity made it to the surface now a skimmer would come and skim those impurities off at the top but what made that impurity be able to come from that deep embedded place up to the top so it can be taken away it was the heat and the strength of the trial that god allowed to take place and we wonder why we've had hard days and hard lives and hard situations and in in in those times we get confused we don't know what's going on but get listen it's the mighty hand of god dealing with every one of us listen we are not all the same our trials are not all the same but god knows specifically what kind of trial you need to bring you the way you need to be but in those times the devils want the devil want us to get discouraged amen he wants us to get depressed he want us to feel like god is forsaking us what did our lord jesus say on the cross yes my god my god why is thou forsaking me but was he forsaken no sir not by far isn't that right and neither are we forsaken in the times of our hardest trials where we feel like you may be all alone you're not alone he's right there the whole time he's right there beside you he just allows you to go through that period of your life amen listen now they're strengthening you ain't meant to deliver you see that trial is intended to serve a certain purpose if you bring you out too soon you'll come out weaker than what you would if you went all the way through it so he don't allow nobody or nothing to bring you out of that place before the time can we say praise the lord notice how he says this now he says that's the way god does his church he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test what is he doing he's bringing you into a contrite state but notice the contrite ones he says i dwell in high and holy places with that person well you think he ain't there he doesn't lifted you up to where he is and you don't even realize it you have god's attention amen he's actually tending to you he's actually elevating you the bible says humble yourselves under the mighty hand of god it says that he'll exalt you in due time but in this real place of being exalted you may not even feel like you're being exalted but in the sight of god now you've gotten to a place where you're really looking to him amen you're saying lord i need you lord i have mercy on me father i can't do nothing without you i mess my life up lord by making all these wrong decisions but i'm yielding to you now i'm calling out to you lord and that's the place god needs for us to be in saints that's a place of power now you're with the king amen you're with the mighty god but you don't feel like it you understand it ain't about feeling give me let me give you an example when peter was walking on that water he walked all the way over to where jesus was so he was about this far from jesus right right he over there standing in the face of god now this this is how powerful satan is with his trickery in our minds he was this close to god walked on water mind you he walked on water to get to where jesus was now he in front of jesus and the devil was able to come in his mind while he was in the face looking jesus in the eye and the devil was made able to make him get his mind on his problem more than the one that was standing before him and the bible says while he's in front of jesus all of a sudden he began to realize the waves was all rough and he took his eyes off of christ i'm gonna look at the water the water he was just walking on he was operating in the supernatural and the devil made him forget about what was really taking place yes isn't that something how many realize that happens to us yes you could be in the very presence of god and satan come through your trial and try to make you forget about everything that's actually that is actually taking place right at that time and when peter's focus shifted his condition changed he was able to sink in the presence of god all right but what was that due to a mental restriction yes do you realize that so we ain't no match for the devil that's right brother right it's like brother jesse what's talking about he can come in in such a way in our minds and bring thoughts in such a combination make you forget who you are right huh we're going to get into something here i ain't going to be much longer we're going to get into something but he was so close to jesus until even though he began to doubt god in the face of god saints we ain't always on our p's and cues aren't right i'ma tell you it's things that god do for us solely by his grace it ain't because we believe him like we should we trying to believe but we fall to many times isn't that right and god will come and do for us what we stand in need of anyway just to show us i was there for you ain't no reason for you to doubt me [Applause] but he was so close to jesus saints until when he began to sing all jesus had to do was reach down and grab his hand and pull him back up he says here he says that's the way god does his church he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until the life of christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober meek gentle humble ready submissive willing turn your head to the things of the world and looking straight to calvary to the one who's doing the beating isn't that something saints so christ allows us to be subject like he did in hebrews 11 to all types of hard situations but what is he doing he's actually getting all of the unbelief purging it out of our lives bringing us into a place of soul dependency upon him so that now he can fully have his way and desire that he wants to in the way that he wants to we enable god to begin to flow through us at that time now the dead is raised the the sick is healed just all sorts of miracles and things are able to take place because he's present in the way that he desires to be he's able to have his way so now god's desire is not just to make us frustrated and have hard times right because he said that he dwells in high and holy places he says with them with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit he says to revive the spirit of the humble this is really something here now because as i said the devil he wants you to focus in on your problem of what's not going right right and he wants you to become kind of consumed he wants your the channel of your thoughts to become locked into a negative aspect of things because there is a picture he wanted pain in our minds right right right but the reason why we go through these things he says to revive revive the spirit of the contrite ones to revive the spirit of the humble what does that word revive mean saints and this is according to webster's dictionary right after god has allowed us to be broken down right once we get to that place that he wants us to be too that he desires for us to come into that that condition that frame of mind when you know you're nothing you know you need him for everything right the purpose of him doing that now he's he's going to revive you now you in the place you need to be now he's going to revive you what does that word mean the word revive means to return to consciousness or life sometimes as you're going through things you forget who you are right you enter into a spiritual amnesia you forget you are a son and daughter of god the devil try to make you feel otherwise am i a child of god maybe i might not be a child of god amen but god understands all those troubles and ways of thinking that kind of cross our paths at times because that's what the enemy wants right but god comes to revive the spirit of the contrite that word revive means to return to consciousness or life listen it means to become active or flourishing again amen it's a place that you would once had amen but then god allowed you to be taken down from that place so that he can work with you a little bit to bring you into true humility and now that you're brought into that place of true humility where he knows in your soul you know that he's the king he's the master he's in control of everything right then from that place he's able now to exalt you or to revive you what is he doing he said he's bringing you back a man from an inactive place to flourish again amen it means to restore from a depressed inactive or unused state the plan of god is so perfect amen because god knows that some of the things we go through saints we get depressed sometimes amen sometimes we feel all alone isn't that right but he's come here to help him unless it's within it it's within his mind his desire to bring us down to that lowly place to where we know that we're nothing but also to revive us up listen in a spiritual way in line with his spirit and his character into a place now watch he says to revive i love this he says to restore from a depressed inactive or unused state to renew in the mind or memory the bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind isn't that right god brings his word in now he's allowed he allows his word to be preached to you and he quickens that word gives you an understanding of that word amen to build you back up again amen he's building you back up into now oh my oh my i'm gonna let this speak to you a little bit here amen oh my like this he says in the message of perfect strength perfect weakness he says and that's the way god wants us realize that we are totally insufficient he says then god takes that person and begins to mow his self into that person he says make his hands do what god would have his hands to do make his lips speak what god's lips would speak because they're not his their gods he said he begins to build a character begins to take this weakness and to make his own self amen now it's no more who you thought you should be yes you understand what i'm saying in this world that we live in people have thoughts of who they should be and they try to mold themselves into what they think they should be amen and they lose total thought total tract total mindfulness of what god wants them to be amen amen so what does god have to do he has to come into that life when it's his life his child he ain't gonna let you go on like that god's gonna come into your life and he's gonna reintroduce himself to you amen and he's gonna take his word and he's gonna begin to minister to you amen and he's gonna begin to show you who you really are at him and bring you to a place where you desire to be like that and not like you used to be you begin to realize what you used to be was a lie that the devil told to you that the world made you think amen but now god brings you under his under his atmosphere amen into his world and he begins to minister to you and he begins to show you who you should be and what his mind was for you all the time and because you are his child guess what you begin to do you begin to agree i wasn't brought up in the church i was brought up in the streets i came up in a drug house hey man my mom was a drug addict you understand what i'm saying i grew up with drug addicts running all through my house when i'm waking up in the middle of the night trying to go to the bathroom amen why did god do that because i needed that kind of a lifestyle to mow me into the person that he desired for me to be amen my life hasn't been easy but i'm telling you right now by revelation every bit of it was worth it i know it was by the grace of god i know it was about the purpose of god now the devil can't come and mess with my mind no more listen saints i wasn't even allowed to be raised by my daddy you understand what i'm saying you want to know why i wasn't able to be raised by my daddy because god knew that i was raised by my daddy it would have been things introduced into my life that would have been harmful to my walk with him you understand what i'm saying that's why god had to take john the baptist out into the wilderness at a young age so he wouldn't be under the influences of those that would have tried to influence his life in a certain way so that god can use him in a particular fashion once he became of age many times we try to fight sometimes and keep people in our lives and those are the very things god is trying to get away from your life because there is a harmful effect that person or that situation or that environment would have on you that god is trying to deliver you from amen but we don't understand that sometimes and we get sharper why did this person begin to act like that why did they begin to treat me like that why did they leave my life or this that and the other not understanding is a great plan that god has in store for you and he's working things according to his will lot had to separate from abraham that was abraham's family huh but it wasn't until light was separated from abraham that god came down and began to speak to abraham again to confirm the promise that he made to abraham and he was going to be the father of many nations but while lot was there god couldn't deal with abraham like he wanted to so god had to allow abraham's father to pass off the scene he allowed his family to separate from him why because god was getting them close to himself he was bringing abraham up into a high and lofty place so we can he can mold himself into abraham amen and make abraham to be the example that he is to you and i today but why was that how was that is because of the working of god in a man's life that humbled himself to god gave up everything walked away from family and fortune for the sake of being joined to god but god has so much more in store for him and guess what he has yet more rewards coming isn't that right saints there's a reward that we got coming to us amen all wind going through all this in vain amen it ain't about what rewards you receive here in this life but yet god will reward you in this life how many realize that we were talking about it a little bit yesterday god can make any one of us millionaires if you want to if you want to make me a millionaire i ain't going to i ain't going to not receive it i'll say thank you lord amen but when he's really worked with you in your life even when he when he gives you abundance there's a certain way you'll deal with it you understand what i'm saying he won't give us nothing that'll be harmful to us so once once we're molded into a particular place where god knows we can handle it then he'll give it to us but until then he'll hold it back why it'll be damaging to us at too early of a stage just like a child you're not going to give children certain things before the time when you feel that you when you feel they're not they're not capable of being able to handle it you hold it back hey man but yet you you say once you once i see you got a better hold on things and a better understanding of things and you're a little more responsible then i'll release it to you because i'm going to realize that's how god is doing us there might be things you want right now but god knows you can't handle it right now amen but hold on he he might still have that in store for you hey man just be patient allow him to work his work in your life amen he knows what he's doing can we say praise the lord sayings as i close on this point amen i love this amen oh my let's let's let me wrap it up in in uh corinthians that was what first corinthians chapter 2 corinthians chapter 12 let's wrap it up right here with paul everybody's all right amen let's wrap this up with paul right here so we see how careful paul had become in his life not to bring any attention to himself he wanted all attention to be placed on god and that's that place of when you're in that place of power that true place of humility where you're clothed with humility that's all you desires for all attention to be placed on god you're not trying to shine in no kind of a way you're not trying to step in god's way so people can see you see me hey i'm the one i notice that many times in churches you know that there are people that are doing things for the church and whatever and sometimes they get a little the devil will come to them sometimes and minister to them and make them feel a little down because they're not being recognized for all they're doing in the church you understand how many realize god will let you sit in that condition amen because he wants you to get to a place to where you're doing it for him and not for your own glory huh many times god will let you do things and not be recognized wouldn't be mentioned at all but yet he see it amen and what's the real satisfaction is that you're doing the will of god not that you're getting glory from any man being recognized for anything you're just able to move right on happy as can be because you know that you're pleasing your lord oh my so paul he was in that place now that's why his ministry was so powerful that's why god came to him and told him told our prophet rather our prophet he said i preached the same thing paul preached to paul's group make it he said yes they did he said well i preached the same thing paul preaching all the saints beyond the curtain of time when he said that he said they all said that's what we're resting on huh why paul paul was in such a place with god he says now if anybody else he says if we or anybody else come and preach any other gospel to you and what we've already preached let them be a curse even if an angel come down why because he knew he it was the spirit of god that was delivering that word through his mouth it wasn't his own word that's why he put himself in it if we come back and try to say anything different we already said let us be a curse but yet at the same time he was in this place which enabled him to be able to speak in the way that he did because it was god now just having his way i'm coming down to verse 7. well i'm sorry i want to go back to verse 6. verse 5 of such a one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities it's my weaknesses that i'm a glory and why this is why he says for though i would i would desire the glory i shall not be a fool he says for i will say the truth but now i forbid lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be and that he heareth of me so paul had not wanted to be a fool to try to get attention to himself he said he was forbearing that's why he spoke as though it was another person that visited these places and not himself right verse 7 says unless i should be exalted notice this part now now this is god's intervention in paul's life he says unless i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations now i want you to just kind of hone in on these saints paul had the holy ghost he was filled with the holy ghost can we say amen to that amen but even with the holy ghost god still had to allow something to be in paul's life to keep him from being exalted within himself even with the power of the holy ghost residing in his life unless i should be exalted above measure through the abundance and revelation there was given isn't that something he says there was given to me a thorn in the flesh who gave it god gave it god allowed the devil to bring an affliction into his prophet's life even though he was full of the holy ghost just to keep paul humble and grounded because of the tight ministry that he was ordained to have god allowed the devil listen to what he said out of his own mouth there was given to me a thorn in the flesh he says the messenger of satan to buffet me he said as he said lest i should be exalted above measure he says for this thing because he didn't understand it he saw the effects of it but he didn't understand it so because he didn't understand it he didn't know there it was a reason for it being there isn't that something god dealt with him in such a way man yet paul was experiencing this affliction this thing that god allowed the devil to bring into his life and paul didn't understand it so he wanted to be free from it because of what it did to him right he says and for this thing he says i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me so god didn't come to him with the answer that he wanted notice what god did and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength notice is made perfect we see that my strength is made what in what so the place of power is a power it's a place where god's strength is made perfect but that place of perfection that place of power it lies within the weakest moments that we have it lies within those places that we can't help ourselves and god allows things to exist in our lives there are things that might be in your life right now that you might desire to be rid of but you might not know god might be allowing that one thing to be there to keep your attention on him to keep you on your knees you understand what i'm saying now notice how i'm i'm in on this point now right he says for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore or will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ might do what he says rest upon me so while he was going through these challenges while he was experiencing these difficulties in his own body god said no that's my grace and it's sufficient right i'm not taking it away paul i'm gonna let it stay there and then paul came to understand that god did this for my good he did this to keep me humble to keep me grounded now i just kind of want to mention to you here with the prophet how the prophet elaborated on this point he says there was probably 10 or 15 men with him did any of those men see that light talking about when christ came and knocked paul down off of the horse right did any man with him see that light no sir paul saw it it wasn't designated for them men to see it so some people can see things where others don't see so paul was he says paul saw that light in so much that it even blinded him the bible says that he was blinded like scales was over his eyes right he couldn't see for several days it was such a reality to him he says and he couldn't see for several days he says later on when he wrote letters his eyes bothered him so bad from that until he wrote with great big letters so the issue paul was having was with his eyes he says he says seeing that i have written to you with large letters he couldn't hardly see he was in jail and he asked the lord to heal him of it and he consoled him three times but what did the lord say my grace is sufficient paul he says paul said then will i glory in my infirmities because i said except i would be exalted above above the abundance of revelation that was given to me a messenger of the devil a thorn in the flesh to buffet me he says he get better for a while and then away they go again talking about his sight going in and out in and out he says buffett means blow after blow like the ship on the sea you know the waves buffeted he says see blow after blow and he would he'd get better and then have and then have it again and he'd get better and then have it again he said lord what's the matter you don't you don't take this thing away from me he says my grace is sufficient paul just keep on he says now if i was just perfect and everything perfect said then when i when i went along i'd get puffed up and say you see nothing wrong with me lord takes care of me brother hallelujah he says then you're getting self-righteous he says god has to give you a little something and i'm in on this point saints god has to give you a little something once in a while to kind of meeting you up a little so he says you know he says that's right kind of make you realize that he's the boss he says oh isn't he wonderful yes sir just glory that's what he had to do to nebuchadnezzar once he drove nebuchadnezzar out made him live like an animal he restored nebuchadnezzar but before he restored nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar came to a confession with his own mouth and he realized he was nothing and he gave glory to god and he knew that god was the one that put me in up and put men down he says that no one can stay his power amen so god's purpose was achieved in nebuchadnezzar's life he brought him back to out of his amnesia hey man brought him back to his right frame of mind and once he came back to his right frame of mind god put him back in position again isn't that right but now he was better he was able better to reign in a mindset that he should have had in the beginning but because he did what he did god just had to bring him back again to a place to where he say now okay now go back you can go back now i'm gonna realize god to do that to us he'll take us bring us down work with us bring us to the place we need to be in and then he'll restore us right back again but now we're in a better position now we're more humble now we're closed with humility and we will never rise above that again once god gets through with us isn't that right so let's thank god saints for this place of power that he's bringing all of us into let's give him glory for that amen praise the lord and let us all stand together as we go before him in prayer as we bow our heads together understanding saints that the lord has made it in a way the way he says no flesh shall be able to glory in his sight amen so let's give him praise always in our hearts no matter what it is we're going through amen understanding that everything is under his control there's nothing out of his control but is right in his control and he's permitting every bit of it but it's serving a specific purpose to bring us into this real place of power to where he has full control we realize that we're nothing and that he's everything heavenly father we thank you lord we thank you for this kind of a word
