[32:05] let's take our Bibles here to Stan
[32:07] praise God beautiful songs let's go
[32:09] around pause amen
[32:11] hallelujah I just got joy the Lord right

[32:18] strength hallelujah we're gonna stand
[32:21] our ground hallelujah on this holy word
[32:24] delivered to us from heaven through a
[32:27] prophet praise God let's take our Bibles
[32:30] go to Ephesians chapter 5 I'd like to
[32:32] continue on this series here by the
[32:34] grace of Lord like to do Ephesians five
[32:43] verse eight
[32:44] on Wednesday we looked at the fruits of
[32:47] the spear we kind of worked our way in
[32:48] chapter 5 verse 8 and 9 with the fruits
[32:52] of the spirit if you get a chance to
[32:55] listen that and you're wondering about
[32:56] the fruit of the Spirit it would help
[32:58] you because some people think the
[33:02] Pharisees had more fruit of the Spirit
[33:04] than Jesus but that's impossible because
[33:06] Jesus was the seed of the woman and he
[33:09] brother BAM said he had all the fruits
[33:11] of the Holy Spirit just people don't
[33:13] understand the way brother Ram explained
[33:16] it he tried to make a point how the
[33:18] Pharisees looked they looked more holy
[33:20] than Jesus but they weren't they tried
[33:22] to act more holy and pleased the people
[33:25] and look like they were more
[33:26] sanctimonious but they weren't they did
[33:28] not have the true fruit of the Holy
[33:29] Spirit
[33:30] Jesus Christ had the whole fruit of the
[33:33] Spirit praise God so visions 5s2 verse 8
[33:41] 9 and 10 and 11 or then we have our
[33:47] memory verse today I sent sister Wendy a
[33:49] text and she liked to do Romans 12 so
[33:52] read our text here and then we'll go to
[33:53] Romans 12
[33:54] five-eight I'll read five eight nine and
[33:59] then we'll all read verse eleven I'm
[34:02] sorry nine and ten and we'll all reverse
[34:04] 11 so let me read eight nine and ten and
[34:06] we'll all read verse 11 for ye were
[34:08] sometimes darkness but now are ye light
[34:10] in the Lord walk as children of light
[34:12] for the fruit of the Spirit is in all
[34:15] goodness and righteousness and truth
[34:16] proving what is acceptable unto the Lord
[34:20] now let's read verse eleven one two
[34:22] three and have no fellowship with the
[34:25] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[34:28] reprove them now go to Romans 12 let's
[34:32] read one and two this be our memory
[34:34] verse four marks here verses one and two
[34:40] so that's all read these together Romans
[34:43] 12:1 and 2 Romans 12:1 and 2 let's read
[34:53] this on three one two three I beseech
[34:56] you therefore brethren by the mercies of
[35:00] God that ye present your bodies a living
[35:03] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[35:07] is your reasonable service and be not
[35:11] conformed to this world but be
[35:13] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[35:16] that ye may prove what is that good and
[35:19] acceptable and perfect will of God
[35:22] amen let's have a word of Prayer if ever
[35:24] needed on your heart just make it known
[35:25] unto God here let's pray together
[35:27] Heavenly Father we read your word it's
[35:29] powerful it's living it's sharp it's
[35:31] more powerful than any double-edged
[35:34] sword
[35:34] father it's already beginning to touch
[35:36] our hearts now as we read it father let
[35:39] your Holy Spirit Lord Lord just give
[35:42] though the words of life to us here Lord
[35:45] God let it cut away anything of the
[35:47] world dear God and father let these
[35:49] seeds of truth fall upon the good ground
[35:51] of our hearts let them be watered with
[35:53] praise Father that they might grow up
[35:56] and produce fruits of the Spirit in our
[35:58] lives
[35:58] thank you Lord that you had your prophet
[36:00] 2,000 years ago write these holy
[36:03] unchanging words Lord while in prison
[36:06] that we might benefit Lord God
[36:08] overcome we'd say the prison's of
[36:10] darkness in this our Lord God that we
[36:12] might be free in Christ in this our Lord
[36:15] thank you for the liberty of the Holy
[36:16] Spirit
[36:17] thank you for Lord the ability to walk
[36:19] in the spirit Lord God and father will
[36:21] give you all the glory today in Jesus
[36:23] Christ's name the church said Amen god
[36:26] bless you mean see they praise the Lord
[36:28] let's look to the Lord here as we take
[36:32] these thoughts now by God's grace we'll
[36:36] look at chapter 5
[36:40] working at part 20 here of the Ephesians
[36:43] series I just have a few slides so
[36:45] Keysha if you want you can pull it over
[36:49] there so Lord we lingual will look at
[36:56] part 20 here by God's grace seasons 5
[37:03] we'll continue looking here so I wanted
[37:12] to share too about that dream my mother
[37:14] had I guess in the dream she was in
[37:15] Israel and she was came into a house in
[37:18] Israel and was kind of panicked she's
[37:20] like where's Jesse where's Jesse and one
[37:23] man found or one man kind of saw her and
[37:25] brought her over to the stairs and I
[37:27] guess I was upstairs working on the
[37:29] plastering and had tools in my hands and
[37:31] some other strange details but she said
[37:36] I came down the stairs I got all these
[37:38] tools in my hands and she just run to me
[37:40] and hugged me and was crying and
[37:43] praising Lord and she woke tup that same
[37:45] way just uncontrollably weeping and
[37:47] praising God that we were back United
[37:50] together so I look at like I look at
[37:52] like this I'm up here and God's gonna
[37:55] bring her up there and unite us together
[37:57] in some house I don't know his house in
[38:01] the promised land
[38:02] praise God so that's how I'm looking at
[38:04] a bus even by God's grace and the trust
[38:07] of the Lord to to quicken these things
[38:09] and you know what brother Troy was here
[38:10] I spent part of that time weeping and
[38:12] crying that God would bring my mom and
[38:14] dad in the message and I'm just gonna
[38:16] keep praying and believing and these are
[38:19] things that I can't do I've said words
[38:21] to her I've given her
[38:22] book I tried to have witness to her in
[38:23] the past numerous times and tried to
[38:25] share some things brother Bram said
[38:27] about dreams and prophecies and but you
[38:30] know this is God when God sends a dream
[38:32] God's talking to them in the night
[38:34] vision praise God
[38:35] God is talking there so I just rejoice
[38:37] than that I'm really encouraged and I'm
[38:40] thanking the Lord that God is speaking
[38:42] to each person praise God while this
[38:45] whole world's being shook by the virus
[38:47] you know we're being you know God's also
[38:50] promised to shake every soul praise God
[38:52] I wanted to read this real quick I found
[38:54] this online yesterday in the year 2000
[38:58] everybody thought y2k was gonna destroy
[39:00] everything did you see this meme huh
[39:02] okay I don't remember that I remember
[39:04] that I thought all the computers are
[39:06] gonna fail year 2000 it didn't happen
[39:09] in 2001 everybody was scared of anthrax
[39:12] in 2002 the West Nile virus somebody was
[39:15] scared of that in 2003 SARS everybody
[39:18] was worried about that in 2005 it was
[39:20] the bird flu in 2006 it was ecoli in
[39:24] 2008 the financial collapse with the
[39:26] housing market in the US everybody
[39:28] thought is all destruction there 2009
[39:31] was the swine flu 2012 the Mayan
[39:34] calendar predicted the world's ending
[39:36] and boy did that fail in 2013 everyone
[39:40] thought North Korea was going to cause
[39:41] World War 3 in 2014 it was the Ebola
[39:45] virus in 2015 it was Isis they thought
[39:48] you know the show the videos remember
[39:49] they were persecuting Christians
[39:51] everybody thought that was the end then
[39:53] 2016 was the Zika virus and now here we
[39:57] are 2020 it's the corona virus now I'm
[39:59] not sharing that to make light of this
[40:01] because we are praying for that we want
[40:03] to use wisdom we want to wash our hands
[40:04] you know we want to be very careful but
[40:07] the fact is we can't let fear take us I
[40:10] remember when Isis was persecuting the
[40:14] Christians I was really getting shook up
[40:15] by that like it might come to the US I
[40:18] remember all these you know I was really
[40:20] y2k I think would have been the biggest
[40:22] one shaking me up there as far as all
[40:25] these because it seemed like it was
[40:27] legitimate but it's it's a reminder for
[40:31] us to put our confidence in God's Word
[40:34] and not put our minds too much in the
[40:36] media right and the world of course
[40:39] they're not much anyway you know but
[40:42] it's just a great reminder that we do
[40:44] not fear we cast out all fear we use
[40:47] wisdom understanding pardon me but we
[40:51] must cast down anything that results
[40:53] itself against the Word of God and so I
[40:55] just thought that was a great meme I
[40:57] thought man I just need to share that
[40:58] with the church I think they'd like that
[41:00] because it reminds us how important it
[41:02] is to not fear right the Bible said
[41:06] things can't happen to Joe because he
[41:08] feared them right and I'm sure we can
[41:11] look at our lives some things happen
[41:12] because we feared it right we allowed it
[41:14] to happen we we gave it a home or
[41:16] debride itself that lie we gave a place
[41:18] to the devil right and then it happened
[41:21] we say God forgive me I'm sorry
[41:23] and then God gives us strength for the
[41:24] next battle praise God so just thought
[41:27] I'd share that because I've lived
[41:29] through all those those are not things I
[41:31] didn't live through those are things
[41:32] I've lived through I remember anthrax I
[41:34] remember all that Oh am I gonna get a
[41:36] package in the mail that's got it's
[41:37] coated with anthrax on it you know I
[41:39] just living a type of those things we
[41:42] got to use wisdom and we got to trust
[41:43] God so let's look here I just thought
[41:46] I'd start with that we did our memory
[41:48] verse in our text now we're in our third
[41:51] theme according to Scofield the walk and
[41:53] welfare of the believer or warfare
[41:55] rather I just want to go back for a few
[41:58] moments to chapters 1 and 2 and I just
[42:03] want to review your position just very
[42:06] briefly I just want to take maybe two or
[42:08] three minutes and just review this
[42:10] briefly here by the grace of the Lord
[42:12] because I was reading through your eyes
[42:13] I saw I thought this morning I just want
[42:15] to go back and read through Ephesians
[42:17] one to four and kind of review who Paul
[42:21] was writing to remember it was two
[42:23] Christians that that started off they
[42:25] just started off as a real small Church
[42:27] twelve Holy Ghost filled Saints how many
[42:30] we got here today that's about that many
[42:32] very similar praise God but now time has
[42:36] gone on since he started the church I
[42:39] think it was four years he's writing
[42:40] this from prison to the Saints in
[42:42] Ephesus and Ephesus is the second
[42:44] biggest city we'd say as far as
[42:46] prosperous
[42:47] rome had the most idolatry it was a
[42:50] worship of women area with princess
[42:53] diana it's not Princess Diana the
[42:56] goddess Diana sorry Princess Diana was
[42:58] from England but the goddess they had
[43:01] goddesses and gods and all kinds of
[43:03] idols but Paul was writing to a special
[43:07] group of believers who were born-again
[43:09] they believed but they were baptized
[43:11] under John and then Paul came and said
[43:13] but have you received the Holy Ghost or
[43:16] you have a greater power than what John
[43:18] had they said we didn't even know there
[43:20] was so he baptized them prayed for them
[43:23] the Holy Ghost came upon them they spoke
[43:25] in tongues they prophesied and they were
[43:27] filled with God's Spirit amen
[43:29] that's where they came from and so
[43:31] before going on because chapter five
[43:33] deals with marriage and children right
[43:36] at chapter five and six before going on
[43:39] let's recall who Paul is addressing in
[43:43] verse one and verse three of chapter one
[43:44] he's addressing those who have been
[43:47] blessed with all spiritual blessings in
[43:50] heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[43:53] that's who's Paul's talking to so these
[43:56] words and we'll get to it just in a
[43:58] little bit the Paul's telling these
[43:59] people not to lie Paul's telling these
[44:03] people don't give place to the devil yet
[44:05] at the same time these are the same ones
[44:07] who have all blessings into something
[44:10] church how we can have all blessings but
[44:12] many times we forsake them just for a
[44:15] few minutes or for your few hours of our
[44:17] day maybe a week we get backslidden or
[44:19] maybe a month or you know depends how
[44:22] long we battle but Paul's saying we have
[44:24] all spiritual blessings but he's telling
[44:26] these people don't forget he said you
[44:28] still got a battle line you still got
[44:30] our battles stealing you're at the
[44:32] battle keeping your mind right and
[44:34] walking in the holy spirit he said but
[44:37] your soul he says is in heavenly places
[44:39] in Christ Jesus Amen thank the Lord
[44:42] that's verse three now verse four it's
[44:44] he's writing to those who were chosen in
[44:47] Christ before the foundation of the
[44:49] world that we should be holy and without
[44:52] blame before him in love and so see
[44:54] those people that need to be holy like
[44:56] Paul says need to be reminded about what
[44:59] they need to do to be holy
[45:01] stop lying right always tell the true
[45:04] stop stealing don't let don't have wrath
[45:07] against Christians don't have wrath
[45:09] against anybody praise God the people
[45:11] that are chosen need reminders to live
[45:14] holy now amen
[45:15] you and I need reminders to lis be holy
[45:18] praise God it's not just enough to say
[45:20] you're in the message you believe God
[45:21] sent a prophet that's not enough we need
[45:24] reminders to live the way we're supposed
[45:26] to live
[45:27] praise God that's what he's writing to
[45:28] he's writing to those who are
[45:30] predestined to the adoption amen of
[45:34] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[45:37] God's riding their children who are
[45:39] going to be adopted right they're gonna
[45:40] take full a full possession of God's
[45:43] inheritance for them amen that's what
[45:47] adoption is right it's taking full
[45:49] inheritance or full possession of what
[45:51] God's called you to do
[45:53] amen how many predestinate souls we have
[45:57] here you are gonna take full possession
[45:59] of what God's called you to do
[46:02] hallelujah and that's and that's done
[46:05] Paul says in verse six and seven this is
[46:07] for those who are accepted in heaven
[46:09] amen
[46:10] in the beloved in the bosom of Christ
[46:13] Paul's writing to those who are accepted
[46:16] in Jesus Christ and are redeemed through
[46:19] the blood and have forgiveness of sins
[46:21] like we sing about today when his love
[46:24] ran red at the cross I surrender my life
[46:26] I give all to him praise God that's Wiis
[46:30] writing to those who know about the
[46:32] cross that are forgiven by the blood
[46:34] amen he's writing to those who know the
[46:38] mystery of his will and church remember
[46:41] God's will is revealed one step at a
[46:43] time you and I don't always know all the
[46:46] steps that God is going to lead us in
[46:49] his will but we know the midst of his
[46:51] will is to be holy amen
[46:53] because he's given us a holy calling
[46:55] praise God and you like Abraham we're
[46:58] not told all the details right away
[47:00] we're just told follow me leave your
[47:03] family leave your sinful things behind
[47:05] right and walk in obedience to the Lord
[47:07] Jesus Christ amen
[47:10] still love your family right we have to
[47:13] leave anything that would hinder us
[47:14] we gotta leave it behind and follow
[47:16] Christ yes so God's will is progressive
[47:21] one step at a time he reveals his will
[47:23] to us praise God he's writing to those
[47:27] who I like this the spirit of wisdom but
[47:30] I want to read this cuz it was powerful
[47:32] when I read it this morning
[47:32] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:34] the father of glory may give unto you
[47:37] the spirit of wisdom and the revelation
[47:39] in the knowledge of him Paul's writing
[47:43] the people that have wisdom now not like
[47:46] the world I got I got a nice family
[47:49] friends my wife and I know him very well
[47:51] they're Catholic and their daughter
[47:54] yesterday went to a Catholic ceremony
[47:58] where they sprinkle her and they put it
[48:01] on Facebook now I'm not making fun of it
[48:03] but this is what they believed when they
[48:05] got sprinkled in there confirming the
[48:07] church their Facebook post said praise
[48:10] God our daughter received all the gifts
[48:12] of the Holy Spirit today at their
[48:13] sprinkling now Church that's that's a
[48:16] man-made denominational idea that you
[48:19] just go you're a certain age you finish
[48:21] your confirmation they sprinkle you now
[48:23] you got all the gifts of the Spirit the
[48:25] fact was that God chooses the gifts of
[48:28] the Holy Spirit for you and he places
[48:29] them into you before you were born amen
[48:33] now all of them now some of that some
[48:36] people may have all of them like Martin
[48:37] Luther brother Brad who probably had all
[48:39] of them he spoke in tongues he
[48:40] prophesied did all the healing wisdom I
[48:43] know I'm sure he had all of them I'm
[48:44] sure Paul had all of them cuz he said I
[48:46] spoke in tongues more than all of you he
[48:48] prophesied right he had words of
[48:50] knowledge and so forth but see this is
[48:53] something that church God places in our
[48:55] lives and I just love the difference the
[48:57] difference is that we know God's placed
[48:59] it there a man a priest cannot put it
[49:02] there but God put it there amen because
[49:05] your predestinated to it God chose you
[49:08] for God's called you for something and
[49:09] God's the one that put it there praise
[49:11] God now I'm going to get to this later
[49:15] because in chapter 5 it said the wise
[49:18] Christians redeemed the time and I've
[49:20] been going out over that over and over
[49:22] but I want to look at that again
[49:23] the reason people don't
[49:26] redeem the time is because they haven't
[49:28] received the spirit of wisdom
[49:30] the reason they waste their time is
[49:33] because they don't have the spirit to
[49:35] give them wisdom to manage their time
[49:38] the church said house how people use
[49:42] their time and this message is the great
[49:44] indicator of whether they're born again
[49:46] or not because when you're born again
[49:48] you have the spirit of wisdom no one's
[49:52] got to tell you to do it as far as I
[49:54] mean the preaching will but no one at
[49:56] your home no one has to urge you to do
[49:58] it because the Holy Spirit is inside of
[50:00] you urging you to do it praise God
[50:02] because you've received the spirit of
[50:05] wisdom you've received the spirit I have
[50:08] a revelation right from God I have a
[50:11] spirit of revelation revealed to me that
[50:14] I must manage my time carefully I must
[50:16] live for God's glory if you didn't see
[50:21] it this morning I put up my next YouTube
[50:22] video the Lord helped me get this one
[50:24] done fast it was called the morning
[50:26] routine seeking first the kingdom of God
[50:28] so if you like that one share that with
[50:31] people if you feel led if you feel that
[50:33] but I thought it's just been such a
[50:35] burden on my heart and this proved it I
[50:37] this morning but they ain't meant I
[50:38] didn't realize it so I read it this
[50:40] morning that's the reason people waste
[50:42] their time they haven't received the
[50:44] wisdom to manage their time and how do
[50:46] you receive the wisdom you got to go to
[50:48] Christ again at amen you got to spend
[50:50] time with Christ you got to spend time
[50:52] in his presence and then when you
[50:54] receive that spirit now I know how to
[50:57] manage it because now I've got the
[50:58] spirit of it I don't know yet praise God
[51:02] that's the answer right there you've got
[51:04] to receive the Holy Spirit praise God
[51:07] hallelujah now I don't think that's a
[51:10] separate thing from the baptism Holy
[51:12] Ghost I think that's just an attribute
[51:14] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so when
[51:16] you're born again you're you're given a
[51:19] portion of wisdom and revelation amen
[51:21] and then you're wise you're not foolish
[51:24] you're wise because you're packin oil
[51:25] that'll last you until the bridegroom
[51:27] comes amen glory I'm feeling good today
[51:32] bro I feel like preaching today amen I
[51:34] don't know yeah I had a good worship in
[51:36] yesterday and how do you sing the word
[51:38] feeling good today by
[51:40] God's grace but notice who's he riding
[51:42] to he's writing to those who were
[51:44] quickened who were once dead in
[51:47] trespasses and sins in other words he's
[51:50] riding the people that used to be dead
[51:52] but now they're alive amen
[51:55] not everybody can receive this if
[51:57] they're still dead in their sins the
[51:58] word won't mean anything to them but
[52:00] Paul was writing to people that I know I
[52:02] was dead but now I know I'm alive amen
[52:06] and so the word is powerful it's quick
[52:08] it's making giving me more strength to
[52:11] live higher in Christ up in those
[52:13] heavenly places amen oh thank you lord
[52:16] oh oh that's like honey in the honeycomb
[52:21] and then boom I'm enjoying it today
[52:24] pretty so be since too far but God he's
[52:28] writing to those I'm sorry who are loved
[52:31] seasons 2 4 but God who is rich in mercy
[52:33] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[52:36] church listen somebody loves you today
[52:38] and his name is Jesus Christ somebody
[52:41] loved you so much he died for you praise
[52:43] God you are loved today someone loves
[52:46] you children it's more than that it's
[52:49] more than mom it's a heavily mom and dad
[52:51] amen God said I love you with great love
[52:55] it's not a it's not a small love it's
[52:58] not a passive love it's an active
[53:00] obvious strong love God loves us so much
[53:02] he proved it through the cross and the
[53:05] Spirit is here to help you to feel loved
[53:08] and if you surrender to that you'll love
[53:11] to worship him you'll just surrender and
[53:14] give over and raise your hands and close
[53:16] your eyes and sing it and worship and
[53:19] love God if you'll surrender that love
[53:21] you'll feel his love amen
[53:23] you'll be able to express love back to
[53:25] him praise God when you surrender
[53:27] because he didn't love us with a small
[53:28] love or a wimpy love but he loved us
[53:31] with a great love hallelujah thank the
[53:34] Lord who is he writing to he's writing
[53:37] to church those who are raised up in
[53:39] verse 6 in chapter 2 he hath raised us
[53:42] up together and made us sit together in
[53:45] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[53:47] hallelujah
[53:49] we're you're doing more than sitting in
[53:52] Bride of Christ fellowship
[53:53] Church pews or chairs you should be
[53:56] sitting above these seats in a heavenly
[53:59] realm of faith amen well he should be
[54:02] sitting not just here but we should be
[54:05] sitting in the presence of God and the
[54:07] presence of angels the Bible says that's
[54:10] what he said in verse 6 verse yea circs
[54:13] we are sit sitting together in heavenly
[54:16] places in Christ Jesus and then we're
[54:20] saved by grace through faith and were
[54:23] created unto good works in chapter 10
[54:26] he's riding the people that he made them
[54:29] to do a certain job to do good works for
[54:32] his name that's who he's riding he's not
[54:35] writing to people that don't have a job
[54:37] on earth he's writing to people that
[54:38] have an assignment I want you to be holy
[54:41] I want you to do my will I want you to
[54:43] serve me I want you to please me I want
[54:45] you to be a light and the city on the
[54:47] hill that cannot be hidden glory that's

[54:56] to be one of those lights in the midst
[54:57] of darkness hallelujah he's riding the

[55:03] are not far from the throne of God we
[55:05] are close we are not to the throne of
[55:08] God by the blood of Jesus Christ that's
[55:11] in verse 13 to 13 but now in Christ
[55:15] Jesus you who are sometimes far off are
[55:19] made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:22] oh sure sometimes the devil tricks us
[55:24] and makes us think we're so far from God
[55:26] yet the Bible says the blood brings us
[55:29] close to God amen
[55:30] and if the reason you don't answer
[55:32] because it's not as will but we can
[55:34] rejoice because we made our requests
[55:37] unto God and we can rejoice that we
[55:39] asked him so he'll do whatever's best
[55:41] and we can rest in his choosing hey man
[55:45] I've been encouraged by that lately that
[55:47] by God not answering some prayers

[58:12] we are part of that great Holy Temple
[58:14] Church God is building a temple and
[58:16] Jesus is the cornerstone and he's the

[58:23] the top praise God
[58:24] we're a part or one of those stones in
[58:26] the building up very top and that
[58:28] headstone is soon to come and this is a
[58:30] house of worship this is a house of
[58:33] God's Spirit dwelling amongst us living
[58:36] through us feeding us strengthen us the
[58:38] Bible said growing up into him glory
[58:42] amen
[58:43] who's he writing to he's writing to
[58:46] those that have the name the Lord Jesus
[58:48] Christ of whom the whole family in
[58:50] heaven earth is named that's who he's
[58:51] writing to then that had the name of
[58:53] Lord Jesus Christ not father son Holy
[58:55] Ghost not Methodist not Baptist I heard
[59:00] brother Ram say yesterday and God's
[59:02] chosen place to worship he said there's
[59:04] only one chosen place of worship and he
[59:06] said it's not Branham Tabernacle he said
[59:08] if I point you there you'll be just as
[59:09] messed up as anybody else
[59:11] he said God chosen place of worship is
[59:13] Jesus Christ amen
[59:14] go get me wrong that's a good church to
[59:16] go to right as long as they stay with
[59:18] the word I don't know where they are now
[59:19] but well I kind of know where they are
[59:20] now but I have tried to help where they
[59:22] are now
[59:23] but see you and I we just can't have to
[59:25] do more than point to a natural building
[59:27] yes you want to get them to building but
[59:29] once they're in the building physically
[59:31] they got to be part of the spiritual
[59:33] building the body of Christ and how do
[59:35] you get that body you're baptized by one
[59:37] spirit of that body amen
[59:40] hallelujah and we take the name the Lord
[59:43] Jesus Christ
[59:48] now who's he writing to I love this he's
[59:52] writing to those who are strengthened
[59:54] with might by his spirit in the inner
[59:57] man right where we're sitting to heaven
[1:00:01] together in heavenly places in the soul
[1:00:03] but now Paul starts getting down to your
[1:00:05] human spirit I'm writing the people that
[1:00:08] can be strengthened here you ever feel
[1:00:10] like you're just not mentally strong
[1:00:11] enough to overcome the devil you ever
[1:00:13] feel like that
[1:00:13] I do but other times I feel like I could
[1:00:16] whip him right see because we got to be
[1:00:19] renewed we got to cast down anything any
[1:00:22] thought that exalts itself against the
[1:00:24] Word of God because we are the war today
[1:00:27] our weapons are mighty to the pulling
[1:00:29] down of strongholds praise God and we
[1:00:32] must receive his strength
[1:00:34] the inner man and the Bible said that
[1:00:36] Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith
[1:00:39] by revelation
[1:00:42] hallelujah whose dwelling in you Jesus
[1:00:44] Christ is in me how do I know cuz he's
[1:00:47] revealed it to me praise God
[1:00:48] I see his life living out through my
[1:00:51] life amen
[1:00:52] I know the dead life I used to live but
[1:00:55] now I see the life that I live I live by
[1:00:57] the faith of the Son of God hallelujah
[1:01:01] thank the Lord who's he riding to I'm
[1:01:04] almost up to chapter 5 see how his
[1:01:05] working my way up to typify here's the
[1:01:07] ride to those who may be able to
[1:01:10] comprehend with All Saints the depth and
[1:01:12] the breadth and the height of God's love
[1:01:14] and to know the love of Christ we are
[1:01:17] people that are constantly trying to
[1:01:19] understand more of God's love we're
[1:01:22] trying to just wrap our we're trying to
[1:01:24] comprehend it and and just try to
[1:01:27] understand all of God's great love
[1:01:29] that's why we sing songs about God's
[1:01:31] love to help us try to remember it and
[1:01:34] understand it and think about all the
[1:01:36] love that he's poured out upon us
[1:01:38] Paul said he that we know the love of
[1:01:41] Christ that's right now chapter 4 he
[1:01:46] breaks in a some writing to those who
[1:01:49] walk worthy of the vocation and brother
[1:01:51] amen was singing about today as they're
[1:01:53] so inspired the Bible says there's one
[1:01:55] body one spirit there's one faith one
[1:01:58] Lord one baptism amen see that you see
[1:02:01] that I thought that was astounding
[1:02:03] that's what I was gonna preach on just a
[1:02:05] refresher praise God that we are one
[1:02:08] faith were one body praise God we are
[1:02:11] one the Rev one Lord one baptism one God
[1:02:14] we're all united in Jesus Christ he's
[1:02:18] writing to those who are walking worthy
[1:02:20] of the calling vocation as a calling
[1:02:22] you're called leave there to see a leave
[1:02:25] denominations escape the mother harlot
[1:02:28] come out of her that you be not
[1:02:30] partakers of her sins and her plagues
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:32] that's right here's the writings of
[1:02:36] those who are coming into the perfection
[1:02:39] of the unity of the faith through the
[1:02:41] fivefold ministry which we've been
[1:02:42] majoring on that lately because it's
[1:02:44] majored in the Bible praise God that's
[1:02:46] what he's writing to those who are
[1:02:48] coming into a more perfect life all the
[1:02:50] time amen
[1:02:51] he's writing to those who are renewed
[1:02:54] see goes it goes back to it again
[1:02:56] he's renewed in the spirit of their
[1:02:59] minds and these are the people that we
[1:03:02] showed you in the picture last week let
[1:03:04] me see I just skip ahead real quick here
[1:03:09] yeah
[1:03:10] he's so he's writing to these people
[1:03:12] here they're renewed in the spirit of
[1:03:15] their minds the same ones that were
[1:03:18] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:03:20] world praise God amen he's telling them
[1:03:25] that you must overcome lying praise God
[1:03:28] how many of you have the power to do
[1:03:30] that
[1:03:30] he said renew your mind if you're so
[1:03:34] predestinated if you're so elected
[1:03:35] recognize your heart high calling let
[1:03:38] God renew your mind and you'll live
[1:03:40] above these things amen he gives them
[1:03:43] all those nice words at the beginning
[1:03:44] that he starts laying it down now if you
[1:03:46] say you are this now live this phrase
[1:03:49] God right just like any any new person
[1:03:52] you meet any any new preacher that comes
[1:03:54] in they're all real nice at first and
[1:03:55] they start laying down the hammer they
[1:03:58] start laying it to the Lord amen like
[1:04:01] any good teacher I had many teachers
[1:04:02] over the years in college and they're
[1:04:05] real nice at the beginning but then they
[1:04:06] start getting real rough by the end
[1:04:08] because they're trying to develop in you
[1:04:10] a type of character they're trying to
[1:04:12] teach you and that's what Paul does he
[1:04:14] starts real good
[1:04:15] all your predestination all your
[1:04:17] election all your blessings every
[1:04:19] spiritual blessing and they says now
[1:04:21] walk worthy lie no more get let have no
[1:04:25] wrath no more steal no more don't give
[1:04:28] out worthless words but build up people
[1:04:30] with your words hallelujah he said if
[1:04:34] you're so alive if you're so new if
[1:04:36] you're so free then live like it I got
[1:04:40] area and see right there brother bang
[1:04:41] this discounts all these people that
[1:04:43] hang around the message that live like
[1:04:44] Devils it discounts them because our
[1:04:46] vocation our calling is to live above it
[1:04:49] with a new man you got to become a new
[1:04:51] man put on a new garment live a new life
[1:04:54] and that proves that you're one of those
[1:04:56] predestinated back there in Chapter one
[1:04:58] amen hallelujah
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:02] see because you can put that power on
[1:05:05] they don't have the garment they don't
[1:05:06] have the Holy Ghost so they can't put
[1:05:08] that power on but you and I can put it
[1:05:10] on praise God
[1:05:11] amen now I'm gonna go back there just a
[1:05:14] few more things see Paul is writing to
[1:05:18] those who are can I say that let's all
[1:05:20] say this together
[1:05:21] we should be what we should be
[1:05:22] tender-hearted Paul's writing to those
[1:05:25] who are tender heart like they have a
[1:05:27] heart for people and they can feel
[1:05:30] people's pain and suffering they're not
[1:05:34] angry and bitter two churches should not
[1:05:36] be full of people arguing debating over
[1:05:38] who's better angry people upset people
[1:05:42] there should be people who are tender
[1:05:44] praise God and who care about other
[1:05:47] people praise the Lord we should have a
[1:05:49] tenderness to about us he said be
[1:05:52] tender-hearted you can only do that by
[1:05:54] the renewing of your mind right that's
[1:05:57] what the scripture says and we don't
[1:06:00] want to grieve the Holy Spirit praise
[1:06:01] God because we know when we do those
[1:06:02] sins we grieve his presence we offend
[1:06:05] his presence and then the anointing
[1:06:07] leaves our mind not our soul it leaves
[1:06:10] our mind and the church said Holy Ghost
[1:06:13] will not leave your so it sealed its
[1:06:14] mark to the day of redemption but it
[1:06:17] leaves our mind it grieves when we send
[1:06:19] it grieves the Holy Spirit with
[1:06:21] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[1:06:23] clamor evil speaking now chapter five we
[1:06:26] looked at this on Wednesday we must
[1:06:28] imitate God walk in love and there
[1:06:31] should not be sins named once among us
[1:06:34] we should have there shouldn't be
[1:06:36] fornication in our ranks there shouldn't
[1:06:39] be adultery in our ranks like Paul said
[1:06:42] there shouldn't be filthy filthiness or
[1:06:45] foolish talking nor jesting but instead
[1:06:48] we should give thanks to God that's
[1:06:51] right Christians are believed Christians
[1:06:54] are those who express the love of God
[1:06:57] and they're thankful for God's love and
[1:06:59] with all their words right like that
[1:07:00] goodness of God saw all of our words
[1:07:02] should praise God and give thanks to God
[1:07:05] that's right now why now let's go now to
[1:07:09] a few more verses here I want to start
[1:07:10] getting it out of the chapter here so
[1:07:12] today we're looking at verses now
[1:07:14] now look Wednesday we looked at nine so
[1:07:17] only those people who walk in the light
[1:07:20] bring forth the fruit of the Spirit
[1:07:23] because a scene can't produce anything
[1:07:24] without God's light praise God
[1:07:27] so those who walk in the light of the
[1:07:30] holy spirit if they let that light shine
[1:07:33] in their souls it will produce the fruit
[1:07:35] of the Spirit that's what Paul is saying
[1:07:37] here we used to walk in darkness now we
[1:07:39] walk in light now look at verse 10 isn't
[1:07:41] this beautiful but I just got done
[1:07:43] preaching that whole series I'll improve
[1:07:44] all things and then Paul comes in here
[1:07:47] says if we're the children of light with
[1:07:49] all the fruit of the Spirit and verse 10
[1:07:51] he says proving what is acceptable unto
[1:07:54] the Lord and the church said oh yeah
[1:07:59] so who is who is going to possibly prove
[1:08:02] what is right only those people who have
[1:08:07] the holy spirit can prove what is right
[1:08:10] amen
[1:08:11] now the word prove means to test allow
[1:08:15] or discern or examine what is acceptable
[1:08:19] unto the Lord so see if there's ever a
[1:08:24] question about what we should do whether
[1:08:26] it's God's will we need to examine that
[1:08:30] in other words you need to sit down and
[1:08:32] have yourself a little Bible study
[1:08:33] attend it's one of the easiest times of
[1:08:35] your ever in history to have a Bible
[1:08:37] study because you have you have men's
[1:08:39] manuals and concordance is like matthew
[1:08:41] henry and naves topical textbook you can
[1:08:45] now you can and Thompson chain
[1:08:46] concordance if there's ever been a great
[1:08:48] time to have a Bible study it's now
[1:08:50] praise God
[1:08:51] these men have already done all the
[1:08:52] labors for us now of course not all
[1:08:55] because no Ram even had to go back in
[1:08:56] this concordance or the seven seals and
[1:08:57] find
[1:08:58] scriptures about oil and wine and of
[1:09:00] course that will edify you more make
[1:09:01] sure the job is fully done right but if
[1:09:04] ever there's a time where we should
[1:09:07] approve what we believe is right it
[1:09:09] should be right now
[1:09:10] so those who walk in the light
[1:09:13] the predestinated of God the the adopted
[1:09:17] are able to prove what God accepts now
[1:09:23] we're watching a little
[1:09:24] video on a church and actually there's
[1:09:27] two churches
[1:09:27] there's the numerous churches that they
[1:09:29] major on doing plays well Ram said a
[1:09:33] Holy Ghost filled Church can do plays
[1:09:35] for children like at Christmastime but
[1:09:37] there are certain you know some churches
[1:09:39] go way far on that let me say what I
[1:09:41] mean they go so far that though they let
[1:09:45] the men and women even wear makeup in
[1:09:47] message churches to put on a play now
[1:09:52] that's like doing a play and wearing
[1:09:54] short shorts or something like that or
[1:09:56] me doing a play breathing then taking my
[1:09:59] shirt off or walking around in shorts is
[1:10:02] there ever a good time to break God's
[1:10:04] word no but then brother bang you look
[1:10:08] at some of the fruits that come out of
[1:10:10] their churches and they're not genuine
[1:10:12] good fruits they're corrupt fruits like
[1:10:14] abuse right so one church I know that
[1:10:20] does that they had abuse in their church
[1:10:22] sexual abuse other one the other one had
[1:10:26] a church split years before that because
[1:10:28] the pastor was flirt with girls and
[1:10:30] women in the church and they split now
[1:10:35] where there's smoke there's fire
[1:10:37] hello churches in the church said see
[1:10:41] when people major on a minor they go way
[1:10:44] overboard into something and sin has to
[1:10:46] show up there majored on one quote for
[1:10:50] the Amen where it says yeah but it's
[1:10:51] okay for children have please well now
[1:10:53] they go so far that now the adults are
[1:10:55] and they're devoting all this time to
[1:10:57] plays and lights and camera and makeup
[1:10:59] and all these things is that what God
[1:11:01] wants us to vote our time - I mean year
[1:11:04] after year after year is that redeeming
[1:11:07] the time I don't know not for me
[1:11:10] that's not I feel a lot of the Holy
[1:11:13] Spirit I'd rather have a church program
[1:11:15] said I'd rather have a church that was
[1:11:17] on their knees praying that God pray not
[1:11:20] for spiritual blessings and souls to be
[1:11:22] saved
[1:11:22] praise God now you can win salt you can
[1:11:24] use place to try to win souls and I
[1:11:26] understand that but don't sin if we're
[1:11:28] doing it right don't have men
[1:11:33] and crossdresser and women and men wear
[1:11:35] makeup and wear jewelry and all kinds of
[1:11:37] you know ungodly jewelry I'm talking
[1:11:39] about simple things see it's we got to
[1:11:44] be very careful Satan's very sly and
[1:11:47] he's trying to get us to get us all into
[1:11:49] foolishness if if Satan knows he can't
[1:11:53] drive us out in the world he's gonna try
[1:11:54] to get us to go to the other extreme and
[1:11:56] be foolish
[1:11:57] instead of being wise and redeeming the
[1:12:00] time but thank God we have the spirit of
[1:12:04] wisdom hey man I was the spirit of
[1:12:10] Revelation hey James was clapping for us
[1:12:12] say Amen all right keep it up buddy you
[1:12:14] got a ways to go now you're getting good
[1:12:16] yeah that's it right there
[1:12:18] hallelujah I remember a little Rebecca
[1:12:20] Graham used to say man and Malachi yeah
[1:12:24] that's right getting into it get in the
[1:12:25] spirit of it that's right that's what we
[1:12:27] need to do right there yeah everybody
[1:12:28] get the spirit of the word yeah test it
[1:12:33] he said tests prove what's the will of
[1:12:36] God prove that God accepts it right this
[1:12:42] reminds us of that series we preach
[1:12:44] prove all things if you ever have a
[1:12:46] question you want know what I think ask
[1:12:47] me about it I'll be happy to tell you
[1:12:50] because we are to prove all things by
[1:12:53] the word of God a brother recently from
[1:12:55] another church he asked me to do a
[1:12:59] YouTube video he said can you do one on
[1:13:01] gambling he said because I have message
[1:13:03] friends that go to message churches that
[1:13:04] will gamble on fantasy sports leagues
[1:13:08] and then they'll also gamble by buying
[1:13:10] tickets and think it's led to the Lord
[1:13:11] now some of these same people are the
[1:13:13] same ones that have TVs in their homes
[1:13:14] and they watch TV all the time now
[1:13:18] something's wrong with that see now you
[1:13:19] got a lot of bad fruits not just one you
[1:13:21] got a lot of bad crop fruits over there
[1:13:23] it stinks right but man to kick all the
[1:13:26] trash out of your home so it stopped
[1:13:29] stinking in there right and so if you
[1:13:31] let to do that I'll do that Lord willing
[1:13:33] pretty soon we charge if they're if
[1:13:35] we're not sure what God's will is we
[1:13:37] need to prove it you think in this whole
[1:13:40] big book here I forgot how many verses
[1:13:42] there were how many hundreds of
[1:13:43] thousands of verses there were you
[1:13:44] thinking all these hundred thousands of
[1:13:45] verses guys
[1:13:46] tell us his will his attitude towards
[1:13:49] something do you think he's not gonna
[1:13:50] hide he's he's gonna hide something from
[1:13:52] us no the Bible says we've got to
[1:13:54] examine it we got to look at it we got
[1:13:56] to prove what God's will is that's right
[1:14:00] and I know I'm a little overzealous um
[1:14:02] well maybe I am a little overzealous
[1:14:04] sometimes but I'd rather be on the too
[1:14:07] strict side than on the loose side
[1:14:10] because I know one thing for sure it's
[1:14:12] not legalism I'm not saying you have to
[1:14:14] this all the time but I am saying stay
[1:14:17] at far away from anything that seems
[1:14:19] like it's of the flesh and of the world
[1:14:22] like program gave that illustration
[1:14:24] about driving up the drive around the
[1:14:26] the mountain right if there's a small
[1:14:28] road on the mountain are you gonna drive
[1:14:30] on the edge and see how close you can
[1:14:31] get to the edge before falling off only
[1:14:33] a fool will do that he said hug the
[1:14:36] mountain and I like it because Jesus
[1:14:38] Christ is the mountain ain't him and I'm
[1:14:41] hugging him I'm in his bosom praise God
[1:14:44] don't see how far you can get to the
[1:14:46] edge see how close you can get the
[1:14:49] Christ amen how true you can stay to the
[1:14:52] Lord prove all things amen so see those
[1:14:57] who walk in the light can prove it
[1:14:59] because they got enough light to prove
[1:15:00] it
[1:15:01] praise God they got enough light like I
[1:15:05] would just sweeping out that hallway out
[1:15:06] there this morning right before church
[1:15:08] started and I was I was thought I was
[1:15:10] doing a pretty good job brother bang I
[1:15:11] thought man I'm doing a pretty good job
[1:15:12] I opened the door all the light floods
[1:15:14] in I sell this Dustin like I couldn't
[1:15:16] even see it
[1:15:16] what a perfect example of this when you
[1:15:20] have light and we run going off the
[1:15:22] natural light right I thought oh it's
[1:15:24] all clean by the man-made light and
[1:15:25] that's what manmade churches and dogmas
[1:15:27] do praise God
[1:15:28] they think they're clean but they only
[1:15:30] got a false light amen they got an
[1:15:32] imitation light but you when you really
[1:15:35] get into the light of the Bible it'll
[1:15:37] show all that nothing there why not you
[1:15:40] can be sad about it then you can put it
[1:15:42] at the foot of the cross amen and get
[1:15:44] clean and walk in the light as he's in
[1:15:46] the light so you keep your church clean
[1:15:50] that's what I want to clean Church
[1:15:52] naturally yet but spiritually more so
[1:15:55] praise God so
[1:16:00] test it discern it try it out prove it's
[1:16:04] acceptable unto God Gloria I'm trying to
[1:16:09] think I just if there's any examples I
[1:16:10] could think of real quick I think one of
[1:16:13] the best examples was in the book that
[1:16:15] we wrote recently by God's grace with
[1:16:17] the jury there's such a balance there
[1:16:20] you really have to be led of the Holy
[1:16:22] Spirit because Joseph wore rings and a
[1:16:24] necklace and he was a type of Christ but
[1:16:29] then you got these women down there in
[1:16:30] Isaiah 3 where they don't want to hear
[1:16:32] Isaiah's preaching and they have 21
[1:16:34] different accessories on them 21
[1:16:37] different accessories on him like isn't
[1:16:39] 5 enough peg wear isn't 10 enough but
[1:16:44] they got to be all decked out it's just
[1:16:46] like the women of the world today how
[1:16:48] much time did you take to get ready to
[1:16:50] come outside you know we still have
[1:16:53] somebody who come to church that used to
[1:16:54] have a used to come to church years I
[1:16:56] had an anxiety this person told me that
[1:16:58] so such anxiety of looking worse that
[1:17:01] they would spend four or five hours just
[1:17:04] getting dressed and trying on different
[1:17:05] outfits before they come out into the
[1:17:07] public always wondering like how these
[1:17:09] people were running so late how come
[1:17:11] we're so late because they have such a
[1:17:13] there's a soul want to look good they
[1:17:16] want to impress people there's one
[1:17:20] person I got impressed or not impressed
[1:17:22] but please and that's Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:25] not to get caught up on such careless
[1:17:30] things I don't even remember what I wore
[1:17:31] yesterday hardly because it doesn't
[1:17:35] matter jesus said don't care about the
[1:17:37] things you're gonna wear and the food
[1:17:39] and what you're gonna drink he said seek
[1:17:41] my kingdom amen seek my righteousness
[1:17:45] and I'll take care of everything else
[1:17:46] hallelujah
[1:17:50] prove what's acceptable in to the Lord
[1:17:54] verse 12 now where am I going with this
[1:17:57] okay I'm getting to 18 well that's a
[1:17:59] good thought man I just thought that was
[1:18:01] so inspired I'll get there normally not
[1:18:03] verse 11 and have no fellowship which
[1:18:05] means participation verse 11 have no
[1:18:08] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[1:18:10] darkness but rather reprove them
[1:18:13] now unfruitful means barren they don't
[1:18:15] produce any fruit of the Holy Spirit and
[1:18:18] reprove means to convict them don't join
[1:18:21] them convict them praise God
[1:18:26] so if you're walking the light you will
[1:18:29] not go walk in the darkness you'll stay
[1:18:32] in the light the verse 12 for it is a
[1:18:40] shame even to speak of those things
[1:18:42] which are done of them in secret we got
[1:18:45] to be very careful what we say about sin
[1:18:46] right because we don't want to say it
[1:18:48] too much out loud because it'll start
[1:18:50] tempting us right like if you battles
[1:18:53] suicide or hopelessness or if you battle
[1:18:55] us you start talking about some of these
[1:18:57] things in the news you start thinking oh
[1:18:59] maybe I should do that or Satan I start
[1:19:01] taking those I start shooting darts in
[1:19:02] your mind but you got to hold up that
[1:19:04] shield of faith praise God many times
[1:19:07] many times it's better just don't
[1:19:09] mention it right just don't don't say
[1:19:12] anything about it
[1:19:13] it's a shame even talk about some of
[1:19:14] these sins that people do because it'll
[1:19:19] start start Tet the Bible said us are
[1:19:21] working on you Satan trying to get a
[1:19:23] place in your mind in ters I just heard
[1:19:30] yesterday you know as far as that
[1:19:31] suicide I just I don't know if I may be
[1:19:33] a good time to share it but this one
[1:19:36] gentleman this one preacher on YouTube
[1:19:38] said that the suicides have seemed to
[1:19:40] rise recently since the computer age
[1:19:42] because that computer gives them it just
[1:19:46] it takes their whole focus away or no
[1:19:48] now it's smartphones or tablets right
[1:19:50] TVs and they get isolated from other
[1:19:53] people and they get hopeless because
[1:19:56] they're dangerous
[1:19:57] all they're doing is just spending time
[1:19:59] with themselves life is not meant to be
[1:20:02] lived all by yourself Paul never said
[1:20:05] you're just you know you're just your
[1:20:06] own lone lone ranger' Christian Paul
[1:20:09] said you are part of a body Amen your he
[1:20:12] said your you're a joint that supplies
[1:20:14] you need to supply help to other people
[1:20:17] you need to supply life to other people
[1:20:19] praise God and so Satan isolates them no
[1:20:22] computer can be a good thing I thank God
[1:20:23] for my my phone in my tablet I can
[1:20:25] preach of it thank God for that
[1:20:26] but we can't be isolated with that and
[1:20:28] so people are losing hope because Satan
[1:20:31] is trapping them and isolating them into
[1:20:34] their own lusts and their desires I just
[1:20:39] thought I'd share that just briefly
[1:20:40] since I mentioned that it's a shame to
[1:20:43] speak of those things which are done in
[1:20:45] secret yeah we are not even
[1:20:55] discuss some of them they're so awful
[1:20:58] verse 13 but all things that are
[1:21:00] reproved or corrected are made manifest
[1:21:02] by the light
[1:21:03] so the real Christian life will always
[1:21:07] prove what's good and what's wrong the
[1:21:10] real light will always prove what
[1:21:12] darkness is hallelujah that's how we
[1:21:15] know brother Branham was a true man of
[1:21:16] God his life was so lit up by the Holy
[1:21:18] Spirit not just his miracles signs and
[1:21:21] wonders but his teaching his life style
[1:21:23] praise God
[1:21:24] how he lived how he lived such a holy
[1:21:27] life unto God amen he would go away
[1:21:30] brother amen just to sit under a tree
[1:21:32] and talk to God and take his notepad in
[1:21:35] a pen that's all he took so he could
[1:21:36] talk to God and that's where God gave
[1:21:38] the statue perfect man praise God just
[1:21:40] sitting under a tree just thinking about
[1:21:42] the good things of God just
[1:21:45] fellowshipping with God he left all the
[1:21:47] world behind all the busyness and just
[1:21:49] to get some tylenol with the Lord amen I
[1:21:51] like that like oh he scatters darkness
[1:21:56] and whatever manifest darkness is light
[1:22:02] pretty pretty simple right Paul's not
[1:22:04] giving us rocket science huh
[1:22:06] he said if you are the light of the
[1:22:09] world he said your life will prove that
[1:22:11] they're in sin now verse 14 I like this
[1:22:16] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[1:22:19] sleepest a sleeping virgin write and
[1:22:22] arise from the dead and Christ shall
[1:22:24] give thee light so you got to wake up if
[1:22:27] you want to walk in the light you got to
[1:22:28] wake up and come alive praise God
[1:22:30] reminds me that dry bones song right we
[1:22:33] cry out to dry bones come alive
[1:22:34] he said wake up if you're sleeping wake
[1:22:37] up and Christ will give you the life
[1:22:39] amen he'll give you the light now here's
[1:22:43] where it gets to this one I've been so
[1:22:44] meditating on and I hope I'm not
[1:22:46] preaching it too much I hope it's a
[1:22:47] blessing to you about redeeming the time
[1:22:49] it's kind of where I'm at right now here
[1:22:52] verse 15 he says see them that ye walk
[1:22:56] circumspectly that means exactly or
[1:22:58] diligently or perfectly walk perfectly
[1:23:02] not as fool's but as wise okay
[1:23:09] so that means foolish virgins will not
[1:23:12] be as diligent or as purposeful in the
[1:23:16] steps there they're choosing to walk in
[1:23:19] but a wise version the wise version will
[1:23:22] be so careful to only walk in the
[1:23:24] perfect will of God
[1:23:26] why because we got the spirit of wisdom
[1:23:30] hey Lia praise God
[1:23:32] see now the reason I rejoice over that
[1:23:34] church is because I realized that it's
[1:23:36] not no longer me it's the Holy Ghost in
[1:23:38] me praise God hey hey it's not me get
[1:23:41] excited like look what I can do it's
[1:23:42] thank God he gave me the Holy Ghost amen
[1:23:45] that's the reason I got his wisdom
[1:23:47] because I got his spirit praise God it's
[1:23:52] not no longer me but it's Christ in me
[1:23:54] to open Laurie that's right ah thank you
[1:23:59] lord
[1:24:00] glory he redeemed means to buy up to
[1:24:05] rescue from losing it to improve your
[1:24:08] opportunity take it back
[1:24:11] use it for good have control over can I
[1:24:16] say I control your day don't let people
[1:24:18] control you control your day by the
[1:24:21] wisdom of the Holy Spirit there's times
[1:24:23] there's accidents and unexpected things
[1:24:25] but he's saying redeem it use it back
[1:24:28] for the kingdom of God use it for God's
[1:24:30] glory see that you walk circular time
[1:24:36] because the days are evil
[1:24:40] wherefore be not unwise but
[1:24:43] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:24:45] is see let's not be foolish virgins
[1:24:48] let's not be sleeping on the things of
[1:24:51] God let's be awake but let's apprehend
[1:24:54] or understand what the will of the Lord
[1:24:56] is because member is said earlier we
[1:24:59] know the mystery of as well I know
[1:25:02] you're right Church so he already said
[1:25:05] I'm writing to people that know the
[1:25:06] mystery of God's will and he says make
[1:25:08] sure you walk in the light make sure
[1:25:11] you're walking like a wise person amen
[1:25:13] that means we're going to struggle
[1:25:15] sometimes the walk in wisdom so he's
[1:25:17] reminding us redeem the time make the
[1:25:20] best use of time
[1:25:23] I want to read a few quotes here from
[1:25:27] brother Branham so just bear with me
[1:25:29] here this is from be not afraid 61 but I
[1:25:36] was talking about the disciples how
[1:25:38] they're on a boat with Jesus doing a
[1:25:40] testimony meeting before Jesus walk to
[1:25:42] him out on the sea and he says he said
[1:25:48] as you're sailing life's solemn sea
[1:25:50] testify sing or pray and like bread upon
[1:25:55] the water it will return to you someday
[1:25:59] speak a little word for jesus do
[1:26:04] something testify singer pray yes do
[1:26:07] something for while you're sailing over
[1:26:09] life's Alamein and then he quotes
[1:26:13] Longfellow which I'm just trusting is
[1:26:15] because I didn't go look up Longfellow
[1:26:17] sure he's a good Longfellow you know
[1:26:20] good fellow he said a forlorn and
[1:26:22] shipwrecked brother in saying shall take
[1:26:25] heart again said Longfellow yes while
[1:26:27] we're sailing life's Alamein let's give
[1:26:29] our testimony let's do something that
[1:26:32] will leave footprints on the sands of
[1:26:34] time footprints that perhaps another yes
[1:26:39] a for loner and shipwrecked brother
[1:26:40] seeing what we did we'll take heart
[1:26:42] again make another try he's seen where
[1:26:45] somebody was pouring it out
[1:26:47] he made a try and stood on the promises
[1:26:49] of Christ and became a soldier the cross
[1:26:50] let's make footprints amen that's why I
[1:26:55] have to Sunday services because brother
[1:26:56] Bram did the church said brother Andrews
[1:27:01] if a prophet of God would have to church
[1:27:03] services on Sunday as tires I get
[1:27:05] sometimes I want to try to do it by
[1:27:06] God's grace because the band then the
[1:27:11] Bible says gather more as you see that
[1:27:14] Day approaching well how am I going to
[1:27:15] do that I got to make more time to do it
[1:27:19] because the Bible says gather more and
[1:27:22] we're also busy during the week when are
[1:27:24] we going to get together he said so look
[1:27:28] at the footprints that people have left
[1:27:30] in the sands of time and follow those
[1:27:32] footprints a god we got a bloody
[1:27:34] footprint a bloody set to follow praise
[1:27:36] God
[1:27:36] we got a bloody set of footprints to
[1:27:38] follow the footprints of Christ who if
[1:27:42] anybody redeemed the time it was Jesus
[1:27:44] Christ and then he says we will fall in
[1:27:50] the footsteps he says foot steps is
[1:27:52] possession God told Joshua everywhere
[1:27:55] the soles of your feet sets I'll give it
[1:27:57] to you
[1:27:58] foot steps meant possession go on and
[1:28:00] get it it's yours every promise in the
[1:28:02] book everything that God ever promised
[1:28:03] you is yours he ain't just gonna sweep
[1:28:07] out the house and say go take it
[1:28:08] he said I've given you Palestine but
[1:28:11] they had to fight for every inch of the
[1:28:13] road he said every time God makes a
[1:28:15] promise you'll fight for every inch of
[1:28:17] the road just take the sword of the
[1:28:18] Spirit and the word and cut every devil
[1:28:21] and unbelief away from you cut loose the
[1:28:23] shorelines that hold you bound to the
[1:28:25] shore launch out into the deep and let
[1:28:27] down the draw amen
[1:28:30] oh thank you lord hallelujah I'm taking
[1:28:34] this cool next quote from taking sides
[1:28:36] with Jesus 1962 he said I believe with
[1:28:40] all my heart we're living in the last
[1:28:41] days I believe there's not too much
[1:28:43] would break this anything and my
[1:28:45] interpretation may be wrong of the
[1:28:47] scriptures that Jesus could not come
[1:28:49] tonight so he believed Jesus could come
[1:28:51] that night I believe that what little is
[1:28:54] left to be fulfilled could be fulfilled
[1:28:56] before daylight in the morning and I'd
[1:28:59] see and I may be wrong on the time of
[1:29:01] that fulfilling but it's at hand I
[1:29:02] believe that and remember Paul believed
[1:29:06] that John believed that polic heart
[1:29:09] believed that Iranians believe that
[1:29:11] Martin believed that all the rest of
[1:29:14] them believed that what if God would
[1:29:17] have told John the Revelator now John
[1:29:19] it's going to be 2,000 years before my
[1:29:22] coming he said John would have come back
[1:29:26] and told the church well I guess we
[1:29:28] might as well eat and drink and be merry
[1:29:31] because there's going to be many
[1:29:32] generations and that awesome God Jesus
[1:29:38] did not tell John it's going to be 2000
[1:29:41] years on purpose because he wanted him
[1:29:45] looking for the coming of the Lord he
[1:29:47] didn't want him lazy wasting the time he
[1:29:50] I'm redeeming the time he said see the
[1:29:55] church would have been loose we don't
[1:29:58] want to lead a loose life do we well
[1:30:01] just we'll do this sometimes and loose
[1:30:03] with the world other times we'll be
[1:30:04] right with the word I want to be I'm
[1:30:06] gonna be I don't the belt on tie all the
[1:30:08] time praise God
[1:30:09] he said gird up the loins of your mind
[1:30:12] put it on tight she can work for the
[1:30:15] Lord he said after all it's your
[1:30:18] anticipations if you fall asleep and
[1:30:21] that watch that you wake with the same
[1:30:23] anticipations because they ain't gonna
[1:30:25] hinder one thing you're going to be
[1:30:27] right there on time anyway see what I
[1:30:29] mean
[1:30:29] when st. Maarten awakes in the
[1:30:32] resurrection st. Paul all the rest of
[1:30:34] them it'll be just as fresh as if they
[1:30:37] were right in the battle battling away
[1:30:39] because they went down right under those
[1:30:42] same and tesha patients looking for us
[1:30:44] coming and they will come a scream and
[1:30:47] up will come the whole church you see so
[1:30:49] it doesn't matter praise God see we're
[1:30:53] just supposed to labouring and look for
[1:30:54] us coming look for us coming and if we
[1:30:56] go down to the grave while we're looking
[1:30:58] for we'll wake up the coming amen our
[1:31:01] whole life is about Jesus Christ is
[1:31:04] coming back soon I'm looking for the
[1:31:06] rapture praise God he says we've got to
[1:31:10] be looking for him right now there's
[1:31:12] your dream brother right now and brother
[1:31:17] you know brother anyone was not
[1:31:18] prophesied he was just telling the dream
[1:31:20] that he thought the Lord gave him but
[1:31:23] there said we got to be looking for him
[1:31:24] now there must be some people in our
[1:31:27] church that aren't looking for him now
[1:31:28] and they're acting like he's gonna come
[1:31:29] later hallelujah and the church said I
[1:31:33] believe I imagine there are some people
[1:31:35] in our church they're not living like
[1:31:37] he's coming now we should live like he's
[1:31:40] coming soon there it is I did but I
[1:31:44] didn't plan that that was the Holy
[1:31:45] Spirit I believe that follow my heart
[1:31:47] he should be we're looking for him right
[1:31:48] now remember brother hey man had that
[1:31:49] dream Jesus came to him and said go tell
[1:31:51] the people I'm coming now now we know no
[1:31:53] man knows the day or the hour but then
[1:31:56] brother am says right here we got to be
[1:31:58] looking for him now
[1:31:59] in other words live in the present time
[1:32:02] we established in the present truth live
[1:32:05] your life like he's going to come now
[1:32:07] make sure you're doing the wise things
[1:32:09] you ought to do redeeming the time
[1:32:11] because the days are evil praise God he
[1:32:19] said so see it'll be just as fresh the
[1:32:21] dead in Christ will rise first we which
[1:32:23] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:32:24] together with them to meet the Lord in
[1:32:26] the air
[1:32:27] whether we're dead or alive it'll be
[1:32:29] just as fresh he's coming amen now but
[1:32:34] until that time until he come we want to
[1:32:39] live every day like he might come the
[1:32:41] next minute because it might be the end
[1:32:43] of your life at that minute you know
[1:32:48] after they found Michael Jackson dead
[1:32:49] you know what they went in his room and
[1:32:50] they found all this evil things on his
[1:32:52] computer now think about that this
[1:32:54] morning I thought Lord if people search
[1:32:56] my computer there's gonna find message
[1:32:58] stuff on there I wouldn't live so close
[1:33:01] to God that way if I die people go
[1:33:03] search around all they find is Jesus
[1:33:05] here Jesus on the computer Jesus in his
[1:33:07] backpack Jesus in his wall it sees this
[1:33:09] everywhere I praise God and there's no
[1:33:11] surprises then everybody knows that's
[1:33:13] one thing he was looking for he was
[1:33:15] looking for Jesus to come hey man we
[1:33:19] don't hide nothing they go looking in my
[1:33:21] my old boxes of high school with MIDI
[1:33:23] videos everything wherever they look my
[1:33:25] no newspapers no they'll just find that
[1:33:28] I was a true servant of God praise God
[1:33:31] you'll remember I'm called scrapbooks he
[1:33:34] said how he liked that look in the old
[1:33:35] scrapbooks in our lives look at all the
[1:33:37] pictures from we were growing up he said
[1:33:44] you don't know
[1:33:44] you're going this may be our last breath
[1:33:46] we have it in us now so we want to live
[1:33:48] like it is he said but to now carry on
[1:33:52] further we've got to put footprints here
[1:33:54] on the sands of times that others can
[1:33:56] see if Paul had it a wet on the way he
[1:33:59] did John would not have known how to
[1:34:02] follow God if John hadn't went on the
[1:34:07] way he did Polycarp would have known how
[1:34:09] to follow if Pollock heart would have
[1:34:11] went on Iranians would have known how to
[1:34:12] follow see what I mean
[1:34:14] each one has to put footprints on the
[1:34:16] sands of time that's why the message is
[1:34:18] by the RAM are so important because they
[1:34:21] show us how does a prophet of God walk
[1:34:23] in this hour right and then we can look
[1:34:26] at his life or at me I'll look at
[1:34:27] brother Neville's life right because
[1:34:28] he's a pastor I look at his life and say
[1:34:31] what kind of life what kind of
[1:34:33] footprints did he leave on the sands of
[1:34:34] time I want to follow in those
[1:34:36] footprints because I want to redeem the
[1:34:39] time because I know the days are evil
[1:34:41] and I want to understand what the will
[1:34:44] the Lord is I got a couple more things I
[1:34:47] want to share here go back to turn your
[1:34:50] Bibles in Matthew 6:33 let me read this
[1:34:52] summary again of seeking first the
[1:34:54] kingdom of God I want to read it again
[1:34:56] with the Greek definitions in there it's
[1:34:57] on the video that I put out today but
[1:34:59] just so you got it
[1:35:02] Matthew 6:33 in church of you
[1:35:10] get up in the morning early and see God
[1:35:11] I'm gonna pray that you do by God's
[1:35:13] grace I had to learn it it took me a
[1:35:15] while to learn it because I had to learn
[1:35:17] to crucify my flesh I used to boast even
[1:35:20] I used to love staying up late and boy I
[1:35:22] paid for it
[1:35:24] the next day I was exhausted and worn
[1:35:26] out and I paid for it
[1:35:29] it was never I realized I'd do much
[1:35:31] better in the morning when I started get
[1:35:32] up in the morning Matthew 6:33 yeah
[1:35:36] Matthew 6:30 seek ye first now seek ye
[1:35:42] first so aim that means aim or crave or
[1:35:45] strive crave first the kingdom of God
[1:35:49] now the kingdom Creek means the rule or
[1:35:52] dominance of the Holy Ghost baptism so
[1:35:55] crave first the rule or Dominion of the
[1:35:58] Holy Ghost in your soul desire first
[1:36:03] that my soul will be ruled by God's
[1:36:05] Spirit amen hallelujah and so seek the
[1:36:11] rule of the Holy Ghost in your soul and
[1:36:13] His righteousness that word means
[1:36:16] integrity which means you're always
[1:36:18] honest and always tell the truth
[1:36:20] so we're to seek to have more integrity
[1:36:22] in the morning I'm seeking the dominance
[1:36:26] and rule of the Holy Ghost and his
[1:36:28] integrity also means virtue where's it
[1:36:30] virtually just went out right like this
[1:36:32] oh there's virtue phrase Lord God
[1:36:33] misfortune
[1:36:34] so we're gonna seek Christ virtue I love
[1:36:36] that name it means purity correct acting
[1:36:41] so we're supposed to seek the rule of
[1:36:44] the Holy Ghost and correct acting that
[1:36:47] will have integrity and virtue in our
[1:36:49] life purity when you do that first not
[1:36:53] second and the church said I'm gonna say
[1:36:55] like today is that the second thing you
[1:36:58] seek church it's the first thing you
[1:37:00] seek first thing is aim for God's God's
[1:37:07] rule and dominion over your life and
[1:37:09] then also I'm gonna seek to be more have
[1:37:12] more integrity more purity for Christ
[1:37:15] that's what Jesus Christ said he's
[1:37:18] seek the spiritual needs first and I'll
[1:37:20] take care of the natural and all these
[1:37:24] things food drink and clothes that he
[1:37:27] mentions the previous verses will be
[1:37:28] added to you and the church said yeah
[1:37:32] that's the Greek summary of that word
[1:37:36] strive for aim aim at the kingdom of God
[1:37:41] I want to be part of the rule the holy
[1:37:43] spirit on earth and I want Christ's
[1:37:45] purity I want Christ's integrity my
[1:37:48] heart first and then people will see it
[1:37:51] when you go to work then your family
[1:37:52] will see it would come out of the other
[1:37:54] prayer closet right church they'll see
[1:37:57] it if you seek that first everything
[1:38:00] else to be given to you what a promise
[1:38:02] what a promise am i doing on time okay
[1:38:06] good alright okay that's right okay
[1:38:09] thank the Lord now I'm going to try to
[1:38:12] bring this down to close here just a
[1:38:13] moment so I hope
[1:38:19] stress that enough since I think January
[1:38:21] or the New Year's Eve service I preached
[1:38:22] on seeking first the kingdom of God
[1:38:26] that's right on New Year's Eve service
[1:38:27] we had communion and so forth
[1:38:29] I've been trying to major on it since
[1:38:31] then on just putting God first redeeming
[1:38:33] your time how you use your time shows
[1:38:35] what you are whether wise or foolish
[1:38:38] right and the reason people are wise
[1:38:40] because I got to receive the spirit of
[1:38:41] wisdom now let's close with these next
[1:38:45] few thoughts I'm gonna set timer here so
[1:38:47] don't go too much longer here okay I'll
[1:38:49] give it 10 more minutes here now verse
[1:38:54] 18 now I'm getting this right here this
[1:38:59] was now this is off this video it's a
[1:39:01] it's a it's a movement called the Bible
[1:39:03] project and I love it my it's one of the
[1:39:06] fun it's a fun but one of the most
[1:39:08] enjoyable things I like on YouTube that
[1:39:11] like they basically just they just
[1:39:12] summarized a book of the Bible and
[1:39:14] they'll draw pictures of it and then
[1:39:16] they'll zoom in on the pictures and they
[1:39:17] got this big scroll looks like a Bible
[1:39:19] and all the pictures it kind of gives
[1:39:21] visuals to the Bible ah say like that
[1:39:23] it's beautiful I love it
[1:39:25] it's just what a and it's all
[1:39:26] crowdfunded to so I like that too people
[1:39:29] are supporting it but in verse 18 Paul
[1:39:33] starts telling them this is how you walk
[1:39:37] in the spirit now we said it earlier
[1:39:39] right follow God don't fornicate don't
[1:39:42] be unclean don't be foolish suggesting
[1:39:44] and joking too much give thanks to God
[1:39:46] but then in verse 18 said be not drunk
[1:39:49] with wine so I guess people in the
[1:39:51] church battled drunkenness right your
[1:39:54] battle might be different it's probably
[1:39:55] different from mine some people in that
[1:39:57] church by the banging battle being drunk
[1:39:59] they battle that so Paul said instead of
[1:40:02] stealin give with your hands instead of
[1:40:06] getting drunk get food with the Holy
[1:40:07] Ghost yeah I like that amen instead of
[1:40:12] drinking the natural drink the spiritual
[1:40:14] one amen now how do you do that he tells
[1:40:17] us next I love this amen Lorie
[1:40:21] cuz I see it happening in our church I
[1:40:24] see brother Amen introducing new songs I
[1:40:26] see a blessing my life on a Wednesday
[1:40:29] night Naomi and Beatrice we can cry and
[1:40:31] worship God why because these songs they
[1:40:33] keep
[1:40:33] walking in the holy spirit where'd you
[1:40:36] get that from right here he's in Chapter
[1:40:38] five
[1:40:39] Paul selling these Holy Ghost for the
[1:40:41] Saints that listen don't get drunk on
[1:40:42] wine he said be drunk in the Holy Spirit
[1:40:44] I do that Paul now he gives a semicolon
[1:40:49] in verse 18 which means there's an
[1:40:51] answer to follow he says but be filled
[1:40:54] with the spirit and then he says here's
[1:40:57] how you do it verse 19 he said speaking
[1:41:02] to yourselves in Psalms and hymns let me
[1:41:08] pull this up real quick here I got I got
[1:41:10] some Greek definitions I just just bear
[1:41:11] with me just give me one minute here
[1:41:14] yeah speaking yourselves in Psalms I saw
[1:41:17] him in the Greek as a set a piece of
[1:41:19] music it's a sacred ode a sacred song or
[1:41:24] a hymn which is a religious ode one of
[1:41:27] the Psalms so they they're very similar
[1:41:29] definitions and spiritual which means
[1:41:32] supernatural songs which is a chance or
[1:41:36] ode singing and making melody melody
[1:41:40] means to play with string instruments
[1:41:42] right rather I love it praise God God
[1:41:46] gave us the strings in your heart right
[1:41:52] speak yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[1:41:54] spiritual songs singing and making
[1:41:56] melody in your heart to the Lord Robin
[1:42:00] says a lot of people sing just to make
[1:42:02] their hear their own voices I hope you
[1:42:05] and I are not so impressed with our
[1:42:06] voice I hope we're singing so God's
[1:42:08] heart is touched amen
[1:42:10] you sing in your heart to the Lord
[1:42:13] because you know he's near
[1:42:14] you know his presence is there you know
[1:42:16] you're seated you know your your your
[1:42:18] night in your night to the blood amen
[1:42:21] you're not at him you're close to his
[1:42:23] blood you're close to a sacrifice amen
[1:42:26] you sing in your hearts unto the Lord
[1:42:29] how do I redeem the time brother Jesse
[1:42:31] start singing more in your heart and
[1:42:34] sing to one another right tell each
[1:42:36] other these songs but you tell tell tell
[1:42:38] each other oh I heard this new song it's
[1:42:40] a glorious song it's a spiritual song
[1:42:44] it's a supernatural song
[1:42:46] talks about God's miracles and walking
[1:42:48] on water least we'll see miracles amen
[1:42:52] we'll walk on water praise God see
[1:42:59] singing and making melody in your heart
[1:43:02] to the Lord so they're right if we want
[1:43:04] to walk in the Holy Spirit and make sure
[1:43:06] we're drunk on the Holy Spirit we got to
[1:43:09] sing together and we got to sing alone I
[1:43:12] started doing that last few weeks I just
[1:43:13] take my downloaded songs and I just sing
[1:43:17] I'm like goodness of God and His mercy
[1:43:20] is more and I'll just sing along I start
[1:43:22] my prayer now by singing along and I can
[1:43:24] feel it in my heart I can just feel
[1:43:25] happiness coming in my heart I'm like
[1:43:27] why did I do this sooner you know I
[1:43:29] guess you all go through ups and downs
[1:43:31] and I walk with the Lord
[1:43:33] but that's one way to make sure you walk
[1:43:36] in the Holy Spirit how many believe that
[1:43:40] remember in the days ahead Sakaya God
[1:43:43] told him just sing if you just sing the
[1:43:46] I'll overthrow the enemies praise God
[1:43:48] remember Paul and Silas
[1:43:50] they just started singing and God broke
[1:43:53] the prisoners chains amen that's
[1:43:55] important note God didn't always break
[1:43:56] the prisoners chains and the church said
[1:43:59] he wrote most of the Bible brother
[1:44:02] Steven from prison why didn't God why
[1:44:04] did he sing it ever well how come every
[1:44:06] time he didn't sing the prison walls
[1:44:07] didn't fall down because it was a time
[1:44:09] in season for everything see that the
[1:44:12] CNR human minds what do you want we want
[1:44:14] a magic pill we want a silver book oh
[1:44:17] all my problems we go on if I'll just do
[1:44:19] this the same way every time that's not
[1:44:20] how it is but that one time they sang
[1:44:23] the walls came down
[1:44:25] amen so see it God doesn't want us to
[1:44:30] make him an errand boy God doesn't want
[1:44:33] us to order him around but God wants us
[1:44:35] to sing genuine worship from our hearts
[1:44:38] unto him and then he will refresh our
[1:44:40] minds he'll refresh our spirits will
[1:44:43] feel like we're drunk in the spirit oh
[1:44:46] thank you lo out of the area
[1:44:51] did you know this boat
[1:44:53] motorman met a woman who had nervousness
[1:44:55] he said nervousness is a horrible thing
[1:44:57] keeps you tore up all the time of course
[1:45:01] she was born nervous
[1:45:02] imagine that born I read you're just
[1:45:06] nervous about everything nervous nervous
[1:45:10] all your life you've been nervous I see
[1:45:12] as a schoolgirl nervous nothing can help
[1:45:16] it and everybody says get next to
[1:45:18] yourself in other words can you imagine
[1:45:20] with a man all your life you'll saying
[1:45:22] stop being so nervous stop it I mean
[1:45:24] from a child your teachers to say
[1:45:26] Stephen stop being so never just pay
[1:45:28] attention just stop stop but you can't
[1:45:30] help it it's like you're it's just part
[1:45:32] of your human grab bag they say hey I
[1:45:35] inherit that from my dad I heard it from
[1:45:37] my mom but man says you've been nervous
[1:45:39] and I see in visions everybody even
[1:45:41] since your school girl tells you to stop
[1:45:43] being nervous stop stop stop stop stop
[1:45:44] but you can't help it he said well that
[1:45:47] don't do you no good can't help it
[1:45:49] sister there's something that frights
[1:45:51] you but Jesus Christ is here to take it
[1:45:54] from you he said do you believe it God
[1:45:57] as I lay my hands on this young lady in
[1:45:59] the prime of her life
[1:46:00] look she's a prime of her life 20s maybe
[1:46:02] I curse this affliction over her body
[1:46:06] so nervousness was a demon affliction
[1:46:08] over her body since a child he said I
[1:46:12] curse it she wants to serve you Lord and
[1:46:15] serve you in freedom church of you and I
[1:46:20] feel shackled something's wrong we need
[1:46:22] Jesus the son is free amen so he can be
[1:46:25] free and worship and love God and praise
[1:46:28] the Lord amen
[1:46:29] so it was wrong if we're not feeling
[1:46:31] free if we're feeling chained up and
[1:46:33] bound up like we looked at a couple
[1:46:35] weeks ago I take it away from her in the
[1:46:41] name of Jesus Christ may it go and never
[1:46:43] return again for God's glory amen he
[1:46:47] said now don't fear young lady will you
[1:46:49] do as I tell you now you feel all right
[1:46:51] at this time see because it's gone when
[1:46:54] you come up here there was a dark shadow
[1:46:55] around you it's gone now it scared you
[1:46:58] you can't help it it comes to you but
[1:46:59] look now the unclean spirits gone from
[1:47:02] you he walks in dry places he would try
[1:47:05] to return again but
[1:47:06] you just take my word as God's prophet
[1:47:08] don't you never have a frown on your
[1:47:10] face so if she wants to be free by the
[1:47:15] rain she's got to keep a smile on her
[1:47:17] face see a spirit will make you be angry
[1:47:21] a demon will make you be angry and
[1:47:24] overtake you make him feel like you're
[1:47:26] was life is so useless in a man I hate
[1:47:29] everybody you love your enemies right he
[1:47:34] said don't you never ever frown on your
[1:47:36] face
[1:47:36] seeing all day long and praise God no
[1:47:39] matter how you feel or what takes place
[1:47:42] it'll leave you and won't come no more
[1:47:45] now go and do that you believe that with
[1:47:47] all your heart how would I know that
[1:47:49] except God told me that hey I didn't
[1:47:53] tell you praise God look at the power of
[1:47:55] the Holy Spirit to make you smile people
[1:48:00] instead of feeling sorry for yourself
[1:48:02] I mean angry and upset and then if you
[1:48:05] want to keep that demon away brother
[1:48:06] bang just sing all day and what does
[1:48:09] Paul say here Paul says don't be drunk
[1:48:12] with wine be drunk with the spirit sing
[1:48:15] to each other and yourself and make
[1:48:17] melody in your heart to the Lord keep
[1:48:22] because the Bible said he inhabits the
[1:48:24] praises of his people he lives in that
[1:48:29] song a man his presence comes to annoy
[1:48:33] he comes a quick in that song amen
