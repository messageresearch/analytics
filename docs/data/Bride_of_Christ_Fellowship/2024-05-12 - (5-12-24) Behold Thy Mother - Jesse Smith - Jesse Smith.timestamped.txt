[4:01] this morning I'd like to go to John
[4:03] chapter 19 John chapter
[4:08] 19 I don't see brother bang so we have
[4:11] to send them a text after service I
[4:13] don't see brother Jose he wasn't here
[4:14] last week either
[4:16] right want to send him a text and Trust
[4:19] everything is okay by God's grace John
[4:21] chapter
[4:27] 19 uh verse 2 5 uh for my Mother's Day
[4:32] message i' just like to preach on this
[4:34] little thought Behold thy mother I just
[4:36] want to preach on that today Behold thy
[4:49] mother John
[4:51] 1925 we'll start there by God's grace
[5:06] I'll read uh 25 and 26 and then we can
[5:08] all join our voices on verse
[5:11] 27 now there stood by the cross of Jesus
[5:14] his
[5:15] mother and his mother's Sister Mary the
[5:19] wife of cleopas and Mary
[5:22] Magdalene when Jesus therefore saw his
[5:25] mother and the disciples standing by
[5:27] whom he
[5:28] loved he said sayth unto his motherwoman
[5:32] Behold thy son let's read verse 27 ready
[5:36] 1 2 3 then saith he to the disciple
[5:40] Behold thy mother and from that hour
[5:44] that disciple took her unto his own home
[5:48] may God add his Blessing to ring of's
[5:49] word you may be
[5:53] seated so for Mother's Day I'd like to
[5:55] just preach on that simple phrase Jesus
[5:57] says Behold thy mother of course red
[5:59] letter words and we love all the Bible
[6:01] words but these are of course special
[6:02] beautiful words here by the grace of the
[6:08] Lord kind of just want to have an idea
[6:11] here
[6:12] today more
[6:14] time so I was just as studying preparing
[6:17] you know I had different thoughts and uh
[6:19] this is the thought that kind of stood
[6:20] out to me I don't think I've ever
[6:21] preached on uh this right here in the
[6:24] scripture I'll probably build my way
[6:26] back to here uh by the grace of the Lord
[6:29] I just like to to uh read a few things
[6:31] here uh in kind of building up to that
[6:34] uh by God's grace and we're thankful
[6:37] again for all the mothers today and
[6:39] mothers to be Hallelujah and what a what
[6:42] an important part they played in our
[6:43] lives Hallelujah so I want to start in
[6:46] Genesis uh chapter 2 I want to start
[6:50] there in 218 Genesis 2118 kind of give
[6:53] some background
[6:56] here Genesis chapter 2 of course we know
[6:58] God is uh creating the world he's
[7:01] already created it and he's building in
[7:04] uh all the elements of creation every
[7:09] intrical part you know God does a
[7:11] beautiful design Hallelujah and uh he
[7:14] goes through the trees and the rivers
[7:15] and everything and then in verse 18 and
[7:17] the Lord God said it is not good that
[7:19] man should be alone I will make him and
[7:23] help me for him and that word help me
[7:26] means an aid I'm going to make an aid
[7:29] for for the man and so of course we see
[7:31] here the first woman uh the first mother
[7:34] would be Eve and uh you know Eve gets a
[7:37] lot of bad stuff but uh you know uh if
[7:40] you would have been there you would have
[7:41] done the same
[7:42] thing brother I just heard brother Bram
[7:44] say it this week he said he said don't
[7:46] uh don't think so bad of Adam and Eve he
[7:49] said because right now you've got both
[7:50] trees set before
[7:52] you and he said you can choose good or
[7:55] you can choose
[7:56] evil so I thought that was that was very
[7:59] very balanced there brother Bram good
[8:01] wisdom uh you know all have sinned and
[8:04] fallen short of the glory of God and you
[8:06] know brother BR tells us though Eve in
[8:08] her first creation was the most
[8:09] beautiful woman there ever was and Adam
[8:12] was the most handsome man there ever was
[8:14] so we all as nice as we might think we
[8:18] are none of us are as close to Adam and
[8:20] Eve Hallelujah and that's fine with us
[8:22] amen as long as I can serve Jesus that's
[8:24] all that really matters to me
[8:26] Hallelujah but I I love what God does
[8:29] here he he says this is uh this is the
[8:32] first thing that's not good in the
[8:34] garden other than Satan being there
[8:36] right Satan was there in the garden of
[8:38] God uh the only thing that wasn't good
[8:40] was that uh Adam didn't have uh an equal
[8:44] part right all the animals had an equal
[8:47] a partner a companion but Adam didn't
[8:50] have one and God himself says this is
[8:53] not good that man should be alone now I
[8:56] know there's different ones in the Old
[8:57] Testament and of course the New
[8:58] Testament Paul calls it a gift when a
[9:00] man can just live without a wife God God
[9:04] Paul calls it a gift that's a gift of
[9:06] God and what is a gift gift is a
[9:08] Charisma it's a special anointing it's a
[9:12] special attribute so there there are
[9:14] some that are called to just have a
[9:16] special attribute of the Holy Spirit
[9:17] where they don't need uh a helpmate but
[9:21] then of course most of us probably do
[9:22] need that amen I know I do Hallelujah I
[9:25] was telling my wife you know with this
[9:26] identity theft brother William you know
[9:28] I told her I said I said I don't know
[9:30] how I could have made this without you
[9:31] honey I don't know how I would have made
[9:32] it through this you know I just you know
[9:34] I guess in my in my state you
[9:36] know you know in my human frailties and
[9:38] in my human weaknesses you know I just
[9:40] want to quit and give up you know I just
[9:41] want to I'll just throw away all my
[9:43] devices and I'll just buy all new ones
[9:45] you know just give up I'll just start
[9:47] all new emails and all new everything
[9:49] you know but my wife has really helped
[9:50] me to have a good attitude and well to
[9:52] have a better attitude I'm trying my
[9:54] best to have a good attitude she has a
[9:56] good attitude um but i' it's just been a
[9:58] fresher reminder that wow I've really
[10:00] needed someone there to help me through
[10:02] this because I've just wanted to uh
[10:04] maybe just ignore it or just try to run
[10:07] from it or be frustrated by it or become
[10:10] angry by it but God has showed me how
[10:12] much I needed an aid to Aid me through
[10:14] this Hallelujah and even yesterday we
[10:17] were reminded you know um someone you
[10:20] know or that person when they when they
[10:21] got through our account uh had had right
[10:25] when they got into a certain account
[10:26] they had already placed a a false email
[10:29] email um you know as a recovery email
[10:33] and I just found out about it now it's
[10:34] been over a month afterwards and so it
[10:37] that that false thing's been sitting
[10:39] there this whole time and and God still
[10:41] protected
[10:42] us so in other words if I'd have been to
[10:44] that account and I would have said you
[10:46] know I want to restart this and send it
[10:49] to this rescue email it would have went
[10:51] to the hacker so by God's grace God has
[10:55] protected me for over a month I haven't
[10:57] had to uh tried to rescue that account
[10:59] account and that was a very important
[11:01] account so just a a uh just a nice nice
[11:04] fresh reminder uh my wife was saying you
[11:07] know uh you know God gives us a shield
[11:09] my wife was just sharing this with me
[11:11] you know God G gave them a shield but
[11:13] you know those weapons can get really
[11:14] close like if you're in a if you're in a
[11:16] battle you know and somebody hit your
[11:18] Shield that's still just a few inches
[11:20] away from your heart there and uh God
[11:22] will I love it God will let the enemy
[11:24] get so close but then he'll say that's
[11:25] far enough Hallelujah just like with job
[11:28] you can go that far but you cannot touch
[11:30] his life
[11:32] Hallelujah and so we're thankful for
[11:34] God's Amazing Grace and this is just a
[11:36] small burden compared to what Saints
[11:37] have battled you know very tiny it's
[11:39] very tiny for me in my life you know but
[11:41] it's still something I had to go through
[11:43] you know and uh still trials but reason
[11:46] I'm telling all that is to again say God
[11:48] made me a helpmate Hallelujah and all
[11:51] the husbands can say Amen to that
[11:53] Hallelujah God give us a helpmate and it
[11:55] wasn't good you know for man to be alone
[11:58] so God made him a
[12:00] helpmate and it was a part of him and
[12:02] that's what I want our sisters to
[12:04] remember you know you're a part of your
[12:06] husband uh a very important part
[12:10] Hallelujah uh and as I can say you know
[12:12] I wouldn't I wouldn't be where I am
[12:13] today without my wife I told my mom that
[12:16] as well it's very true so it kind of
[12:18] ties in together with that attribute of
[12:20] the feminine character that God gave to
[12:22] a woman a Godly woman
[12:24] Hallelujah um and so we're thankful for
[12:27] that and God designed her you know to be
[12:31] uh the help that the man needs and I'm
[12:33] just going to use this uh quote from
[12:35] John Gil John Gil was a preacher in the
[12:37] 1800s faithful preacher uh he quotes the
[12:40] Bible it's not good that man should be
[12:41] alone uh he said it wasn't pleasant or
[12:44] comfortable to Adam nor agreeable to his
[12:48] nature to be alone because he was a
[12:50] social creature right we're all social
[12:53] creatures we like to talk we like to
[12:55] Fellowship we like to laugh we like to
[12:58] have a good time most of us don't like
[13:01] being alone I'm sure there's times you
[13:04] know my wife and I with eight children
[13:05] there's times we just like to get in a
[13:06] room where it's quiet sometimes you know
[13:09] I'm a school teacher there's times I
[13:10] surely I surely like my break of 35
[13:12] minutes to have just peace and quiet
[13:14] just for a few minutes um but most of
[13:17] the time we are social
[13:19] creatures um and then he goes on to say
[13:24] uh that you know he not only was she
[13:27] useful for his species and to propagate
[13:30] and of course have have have seed and
[13:32] children but also for the glory of his
[13:36] creator right God didn't want him alone
[13:39] for the glory of God because it
[13:41] glorified God when Adam and Eve were
[13:44] together right because they would
[13:46] produce Believers Hallelujah they would
[13:48] glorify God their lives would glorify
[13:50] God we know for sure right we know for
[13:52] sure Adam and Eve taught Cain and Abel
[13:54] how to
[13:55] worship right and God revealed it uh to
[13:59] able that it was blood and that God
[14:01] requires a certain sacrifice amen so it
[14:05] was that glorified God when parents
[14:07] could pass down this is the right kind
[14:09] of worship and I'm glad we can do that
[14:11] here we could pass down on our children
[14:13] you need the Holy
[14:15] Ghost you need more than God sent a
[14:18] prophet Hallelujah you you need more
[14:21] than uh John 3:16 although we John 3:16
[14:24] is a great summary of The Gospel amen
[14:26] but you need to acts 238 hallelujah amen
[14:29] need to acts chap 2:4 amen amen you need
[14:32] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah because
[14:33] there's more required in this day
[14:36] hallelujah it's it was the same thing
[14:38] you know on the day of Pentecost you
[14:39] know they had to go beyond animal
[14:41] sacrifices you know there's more than
[14:43] that God showed us more they had to go
[14:45] beyond John the Baptist water baptism
[14:48] there's more than that praise God and uh
[14:51] you know John the Baptist baptism uh It
[14:53] produced a good character in Apollo
[14:56] right It produced a good man he was
[14:58] fervent he loved the the word of God It
[15:00] produced Aquilla Priscilla you know
[15:02] there's some great Believers in there
[15:04] but there was more to it hallelujah amen
[15:06] and so that's what we're saying today
[15:08] we're thankful for John 3:16 we're
[15:09] thankful for all the verses but what we
[15:12] need is the Holy Ghost amen each child
[15:16] uh each child that grows up must have
[15:18] their own experience with God God
[15:20] doesn't have grandchildren let me remind
[15:21] that we don't have grandchild each one
[15:23] must have their own experience praise
[15:25] God and that's what it's our duty as our
[15:28] generation as I've said you know with
[15:29] the Revival we had last year at Napoleon
[15:31] or different meetings we've had here
[15:34] when we can see our children get in the
[15:35] presence of God we know we've done our
[15:38] duty as parents amen because that's our
[15:41] duty to get them in the presence of God
[15:43] so that our children the Next Generation
[15:46] knows God the way we know God and then
[15:49] it's our responsibility of course to
[15:51] continue that and teach that uh and
[15:53] share that but remember it was only one
[15:56] generation after Joshua that judges came
[15:59] and the Bible said they didn't teach the
[16:01] Next Generation the word of God so we we
[16:04] realize and even Ronald Reagan said it
[16:06] you know uh different American
[16:08] presidents have said communism is only
[16:10] one generation away from any government
[16:14] right and so is apostasy in the church
[16:17] or heresy heresy is only one generation
[16:20] away we can see it in the Brandon family
[16:22] I'm trying to be kind here it is I know
[16:23] it's Mother's Day but we can see it it's
[16:25] only one generation
[16:27] away and so each person each each
[16:30] individual must have their own
[16:31] experience with God and thank God he
[16:34] said he never leave us nor forsake us
[16:36] hallelujah thank God he said all who
[16:39] call upon the name of the Lord shall be
[16:41] saved hallelujah amen the Bible said
[16:44] he's n unto all them that are of a
[16:46] broken heart and a con contrite spirit
[16:49] Hallelujah and the Bible remember said
[16:51] the Bible said the eyes of the righteous
[16:53] or I'm sorry the eyes of the Lord run
[16:54] around the face of the entire world Amen
[16:57] trying to find someone he can show
[16:59] himself powerful in amen hallelujah so
[17:03] we have that confidence that Christ is
[17:05] here today amen and he wants to show his
[17:07] power in all of our Lives
[17:10] amen hallelujah now getting back to John
[17:12] Gil he said I'll make him a helpmate he
[17:15] said I'll make him one to help him in
[17:17] the Affairs of life not only for the
[17:19] propagation but to provide things useful
[17:22] and comfortable comfortable for him to
[17:24] dress his food I sure appreciate my wife
[17:27] dressing our food Hallelujah don't you
[17:29] Brothers appreciate your wives and
[17:32] mothers he says to dress the food and
[17:35] take care of the Affairs of the family
[17:37] and that's what you know I've always
[17:39] told people when people say oh brother
[17:40] Jesse you know we appreciate your
[17:41] children I always say well my wife's
[17:43] with him way more than I am I mean way
[17:47] more I'm I'm at work you know if you
[17:49] count driving maybe eight eight and a
[17:50] half hours a day I'm away and my wife's
[17:53] with them all that other time and then
[17:55] when I got home I got bills to pay or
[17:57] I've got mow the grass or you know I'm
[17:59] busy too and so they're mostly around
[18:03] her so that's why I you know I I I
[18:06] understand what brother Bram said he
[18:07] said if there's any credit to the
[18:08] Brandon family give it to Sister
[18:11] ma
[18:13] right because God showed him you know
[18:15] you can't just do discernments all the
[18:17] time you've got to take a few weeks off
[18:18] and go hunting you got to rest your
[18:20] human Spirit or else you're going to
[18:22] break
[18:23] down right and so who did God call God
[18:26] called a good godly woman me me BR amen
[18:32] hallelujah and it God gave her to him to
[18:36] manage the Affairs of the
[18:38] family and brother Bram not brother Bram
[18:41] but John Gil said uh God gave adam one
[18:44] like himself in nature and temper and
[18:47] disposition in the form and shape as one
[18:50] before him that would be pleasing in his
[18:52] sight and with whom he might
[18:54] delightfully
[18:55] Converse but in all respects agreeable
[18:58] to him and entirely answerable to his
[19:00] case and circumstances his wants and
[19:03] wishes Hallelujah so we see in in
[19:06] husband and wife and mother and father
[19:09] we see a perfect compliment one to
[19:11] another I'll say like this Brothers if
[19:13] you're married you know it's true when
[19:15] there's uh communion true communion of
[19:18] the Holy Ghost between husband and wife
[19:19] it's the closest thing there is to
[19:21] heaven on
[19:22] Earth right Brothers I thought I'd get a
[19:24] few more amens on
[19:26] that well we don't have many married men
[19:29] in our church that's probably why we
[19:31] don't have a lot of brothers in our
[19:33] church and two of them are missing
[19:35] anyway too but it's true you know it's
[19:38] the closest thing uh to heaven on Earth
[19:40] because that's what God gave
[19:41] adam and Adam and God brought that down
[19:44] to Adam he was do he was Dominion he had
[19:47] dominion over the Earth amen he had the
[19:50] power of God the authority of God and
[19:52] God gave him the best thing that he
[19:53] could give him a wife
[19:55] Hallelujah and so it wasn't good that he
[19:57] was alone
[19:59] everything was good except that and of
[20:01] course then the devil came
[20:03] later so we see it's it's an important
[20:05] part here that God built this in and I
[20:08] want to uh revisit a few verses here
[20:10] tooa uh Ruth 4:11 and all the people
[20:14] that were in the gate and the elders
[20:16] said we Are
[20:18] Witnesses of course this is with Ruth
[20:20] and Boaz the Lord make the woman Ruth
[20:22] that has come into thine house like
[20:24] Rachel and like Leah which to did build
[20:28] the House of Israel and do thou worthily
[20:32] in ephr and be famous in Bethlehem and I
[20:36] preached this years ago but I just want
[20:38] to rehearse some of these thoughts I've
[20:39] had you know for Mother's Day I felt
[20:41] have been from the Lord and I just want
[20:42] to reiterate them just to remind
[20:45] us you
[20:46] know it says here plainly Rachel and
[20:49] Leah were going to build the house
[20:53] Hallelujah and so that's what God did
[20:56] God used these women to build the house
[20:58] so
[20:59] uh God called Abraham right to to
[21:02] establish this house but then God was
[21:04] going to use the mothers to build the
[21:06] house
[21:08] Hallelujah Abraham was going to command
[21:10] his house to keep the way of the Lord
[21:11] hallelujah amen and have his servants
[21:14] and and uh the flocks and the herds and
[21:17] the financial
[21:18] aspect but the house of Israel think
[21:20] about that the house we would know uh
[21:22] that would be called the the children of
[21:24] Israel the TW tribes of Israel were
[21:26] built by the mothers of Hallelujah birth
[21:29] them and raise them and I think it's so
[21:32] beautiful you know uh the Bible
[21:35] specifically points out these two women
[21:38] and these two women are specifically
[21:39] pointed out as Builders of the House of
[21:42] Israel which God had promised to
[21:45] Abraham amen Rachel and
[21:49] Leah and God built them you know uh and
[21:51] and one was hated and one was loved
[21:54] Hallelujah talk about how many Mother's
[21:56] Day did Leah have where she didn't
[21:57] really feel loved
[21:59] remember Leah loved of the Lord that was
[22:01] years ago preached that how many
[22:03] Mother's Day did she go through where
[22:05] she probably didn't feel like she was
[22:06] the most loved
[22:08] wife and yet God looked at her and God
[22:11] said I'm using you to fulfill my promise
[22:14] to
[22:15] Abraham God told Abraham your seed is
[22:18] going to be like the stars of Heaven the
[22:19] Sands of the
[22:21] earth and God used these two women one
[22:24] was pretty uh one was the most favored
[22:27] one was not as is pretty and one was not
[22:30] loved so much and yet God can use us no
[22:33] matter what we look like amen no matter
[22:35] what we look like no matter how we're
[22:37] treated God can still use us for his
[22:39] glory and to fulfill prophecy Hallelujah
[22:42] to fulfill his purpose
[22:46] Hallelujah and these women were just as
[22:48] much part of it as
[22:49] Abraham because a after Abraham was gone
[22:52] the promise of God still remained the
[22:55] plan of God was still in process amen oh
[22:58] Church you're just as much a part of it
[22:59] no matter male or female child adult no
[23:02] matter how old you are you're just as
[23:04] much a part of the body of Christ as
[23:05] anybody else amen amen hallelujah
[23:08] remember the greatest Among Us are the
[23:10] servants Hallelujah I've said that many
[23:13] times but we look around and you look in
[23:15] a home who's really doing a lot of the
[23:16] service or amongst the preachers who's
[23:18] really the servants Hallelujah I'm
[23:20] talking about preachers
[23:21] worldwide who's the ones getting served
[23:24] and who's the ones that are serving
[23:26] Jesus said the servants are the greatest
[23:30] so let's keep that in mind
[23:32] hallelujah hallelujah remember the Bible
[23:34] said God gives greater honor to the
[23:37] least esteemed members of the body God
[23:40] will honor
[23:41] them it doesn't look like maybe they're
[23:44] being honored but God's going to honor
[23:47] them and I was reminded too a couple
[23:49] weeks ago I was listening I was no I'm
[23:51] sorry yeah I was reading a book we're
[23:53] reading our uh book and we're you know
[23:55] reading about American history for our
[23:56] Bible
[23:57] time and I was reminded how
[24:00] uh God told Israel in
[24:04] Exodus he said I've heard your cries in
[24:08] slavery and I've come down I've come
[24:12] down I've come down to deliver
[24:15] you and it was just a fresh reminder God
[24:18] heard it for 400
[24:21] years and how many generations I mean
[24:23] they lived at least 100 right I mean
[24:25] Moses lived 120 years so that that's at
[24:27] least four generations maybe three and a
[24:28] half four so just the point just the
[24:31] point that someone could live their
[24:33] whole life crying out to God and see no
[24:36] real answer to their prayers but yet the
[24:38] whole time God was
[24:40] listening it was just a a fresh reminder
[24:43] to me that God hears our prayers no
[24:45] matter what our circumstances look like
[24:47] God has a purpose God's Got A Time God's
[24:50] got a season God's got a program amen
[24:53] but God still hears you whether you wait
[24:55] 5 years 40 years 400 years
[24:58] God still hears your cries
[25:01] amen hallelujah I'll say like this he e
[25:04] he'll either dry your tears now or he'll
[25:06] dry your tears later amen cuz we are
[25:09] promised in revelation 22 I'll wipe away
[25:12] all the tears from their eyes
[25:14] amen I was just it was just a fresh
[25:16] beautiful reminder I thought about then
[25:18] that they brought it to American history
[25:20] and the slavery issue and the hundreds
[25:23] of years you know uh uh Americans tried
[25:26] to end slavery
[25:28] and how awful the situations would be
[25:31] but yet God heard every one of those
[25:35] prayers amen
[25:37] hallelujah and so every every person was
[25:41] important every generation was
[25:44] important what if one of the generations
[25:46] would have said oh let's give up let's
[25:47] stop crying out to God and God don't
[25:49] hear us I've been I've been a slave my
[25:51] whole life I'm you know you can either
[25:52] use Israel or American slaves
[25:55] right see it's so important for each
[25:58] generation to keep the faith am to to to
[26:02] instill in the Next Generation even if
[26:04] we don't see it change it's going to
[26:06] change amen hallelujah God's going to do
[26:09] something amen
[26:11] hallelujah and the Bible said in Hebrews
[26:13] 11 many died not inheriting the promises
[26:16] hallelujah oh because we we have we must
[26:19] wait Hallelujah till we are with them
[26:21] many promises take for all of us
[26:23] together in fact a lot of this Old
[26:25] Testament prophecies are about when
[26:27] Jesus finishes that when Jesus comes
[26:29] back they're about the Armageddon
[26:31] they're about the Army coming out of
[26:33] Heaven they're about the Millennium
[26:35] Hallelujah heyen many of these promises
[26:38] are about when the body gets together
[26:40] when the family of God has one great
[26:42] holy reunion hallelujah amen my
[26:49] goodness so each person had a intrical
[26:52] part and like Rachel and Leah whether
[26:54] you're loved or beautiful or whether
[26:55] you're not so beautiful or not so loved
[26:57] God sees you building the kingdom of God
[27:01] hallelujah you're building the kingdom
[27:03] of
[27:04] God hallelujah because remember Jesus
[27:06] said the kingdom of God is not in
[27:07] Jeffersonville the kingdom of God is not
[27:09] in uh you name it akan or whatever the
[27:12] kingdom of God is within you
[27:15] hallelujah amen Proverbs 9 verse one
[27:18] honey I'm going to give you some verses
[27:19] here just to remind just to pull up some
[27:22] good memory uh scriptures here you know
[27:25] this this feminine attribute is super
[27:27] important we saw it uh we saw it there
[27:29] in Adam and Eve Eve wasn't a separate
[27:32] person or a separate creation now she
[27:35] became her own separate person but
[27:37] that's not how she started she started
[27:39] being one with Adam
[27:42] Hallelujah and she was just as much Adam
[27:45] as Adam I mean she their name was called
[27:48] Adam Hallelujah remember in Genesis 5
[27:52] and so this feminine attribute is such
[27:54] an important attribute wisdom builds her
[27:57] house she hath hewed out her Seven
[28:00] Pillars Hallelujah so we see that wisdom
[28:04] the wisdom of God the uh the the timing
[28:06] of God the understanding of God the
[28:09] intelligence of God is given a feminine
[28:12] attribute and remember feminine is the
[28:14] weaker attribute so God has strong
[28:18] attributes he has weak attributes but
[28:20] yet they're all God's attributes
[28:23] Hallelujah God said wisdom builds the
[28:26] house
[28:28] Hallelujah so it takes this feminine
[28:31] attribute to
[28:32] build right it doesn't really matter how
[28:35] strong let's let's pretend brother
[28:36] Austin we got a we got a crew of uh
[28:39] strong young Amish men going to build
[28:41] your a house you
[28:42] know that that's really good it's good
[28:44] to have strong muscles and those those
[28:46] fresh beards they got you know like God
[28:48] that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying
[28:49] to do Amish
[28:50] beard to honor my former Amish friends I
[28:54] preached to last week but imagine you
[28:56] got a big bulky your strong musclebound
[28:58] crew but they got no
[29:00] wisdom you're not going to have a very
[29:02] good house I don't care how many nails
[29:05] they can pound in I don't care how many
[29:07] trusses they can lift and and and put up
[29:11] if they don't have wisdom they're not
[29:13] going to build a very good house
[29:15] Hallelujah so we see the same attribute
[29:17] God has strength and power but then God
[29:20] has weaker attributes God has we say
[29:22] lesser attributes but they're equally as
[29:25] important in the plan of God Hallelujah
[29:29] wisdom to build their house so for
[29:31] example let me just do another
[29:34] one there's nine spiritual gifts right
[29:37] you know the ones we like to see or I
[29:39] like I'll just use me the ones I want to
[29:40] see is I want to see Miracles I want to
[29:42] see tongues
[29:43] interpretation I want to see the dead
[29:45] raised you know I'm talking that that's
[29:47] what is that's what might attract me but
[29:49] we have other attributes that are just
[29:52] as important as the other ones right
[29:55] what if you now this is what we kind of
[29:56] see in the message what if you have all
[29:58] all miracles but no wisdom or knowledge
[30:00] of the word of God now just the same's
[30:03] true too what if you have all wisdom or
[30:05] knowledge but no Miracles see you want
[30:07] to have all that God has for us
[30:09] hallelujah
[30:11] amen so see we have all these attributes
[30:14] God wants us to have all of them
[30:15] Hallelujah that's why I was preaching on
[30:17] perfect Faith you know just as part of
[30:19] the song but it's a great reminder for
[30:20] us God give us
[30:22] revelation we want a perfect revelation
[30:24] of your will hallelujah amen I mean uh
[30:28] would wouldn't it be something Church
[30:29] you know just I'm sure we've had these
[30:31] moments in our lives maybe we haven't
[30:32] fully realized it as I said on Wednesday
[30:34] but in those moments when you've got a
[30:36] revelation or you just got faith you
[30:38] just know it's going to
[30:40] happen right and aren't those wonderful
[30:42] moments praise God when God has dropped
[30:44] something in your heart and you know
[30:46] God's going to answer God's going to
[30:48] change the situation hallelujah praise
[30:50] God oh it's a great feeling Hallelujah
[30:53] to know that God's going to do something
[30:55] I know God heard my prayer Hallelujah
[30:58] it's a great feeling right and so is the
[31:01] same as having the knowledge of God the
[31:02] wisdom of God the discernment of God
[31:05] Amen all these are attributes of the
[31:08] same holy
[31:10] spirit so we have to have wisdom we have
[31:12] to have these weaker Parts as well maybe
[31:15] uh not not so popular part scen as well
[31:19] in order to build the
[31:21] house Hallelujah now also don't forget
[31:24] uh numbers uh 19 I think it's two and
[31:27] three yeah I got three on here but put
[31:29] up numbers 19 2 and 3 even the red heer
[31:32] which typed Christ how many know there's
[31:34] a lot of talk about red heers in the
[31:37] news I saw a video last week on it and
[31:39] they didn't say whether they'd
[31:41] sacrificed the red Heff or not but they
[31:42] were actually there with the cameras you
[31:44] can see them there there are these four
[31:47] female red heers from Texas shipped over
[31:51] to Israel and they got them safely
[31:53] protected because they said for 2,000
[31:55] years I think they haven't had I'm I'm
[31:57] sorry yeah for 2,000 years they haven't
[31:58] had a red hepher and then this is
[32:01] supposed to be the 10th and final red
[32:02] hepher according to the uh the rabbis
[32:05] writings about red heers until the
[32:07] Messiah they've had nine red heers now
[32:09] this is what they say I I don't see it
[32:11] in scripture but this is what the rabbis
[32:13] say and they need one more red heer
[32:16] until the Messiah comes but Church
[32:19] they're going to realize Jesus is the
[32:20] real red heer amen hallelujah the
[32:23] natural can the Bible said the blood of
[32:25] animals can only purify the flesh but
[32:28] the blood of Jesus Christ purifies Soul
[32:30] and Spirit hallelujah amen
[32:34] hallelujah and this the ordinance of the
[32:36] law which the Lord has commanded saying
[32:37] speak on the children of Israel that
[32:39] they bring thee a red high for heer
[32:40] without spot wherein is no
[32:43] blemish and upon which never came yoke
[32:46] so they're real careful they showed the
[32:47] video they're real careful not to put
[32:49] even like a little cloth on the red
[32:51] heers they can't have any yoke on them
[32:53] they can't do any
[32:55] work it's really something and uh they
[32:58] examined them they they showed they got
[33:00] the uh they got the magnifying glasses
[33:02] they examined looking for any white hair
[33:04] at all they've got four so far that have
[33:06] passed the test but then they can only
[33:09] be sacrificed in a certain time there
[33:10] are certain times and years I think
[33:12] that's a couple years we'll
[33:14] see and ye shall give her unto elas of
[33:16] the priest her everybody say her her
[33:20] unto the Ellas of the priest that he may
[33:21] bring her forth without the camp and one
[33:24] shall slay her before his face so
[33:28] Redemption wasn't possible without the
[33:31] female right Hallelujah so birth is not
[33:36] even possible without the
[33:38] female Eve right nor is redemption
[33:42] possible without the female Mary
[33:45] Hallelujah where' Messiah come from Mary
[33:48] female right we know she's just an
[33:50] incubator but she's still part of the
[33:53] program Hallelujah the church you're
[33:54] still part of the program amen right
[33:57] each one of us are part of the program
[34:00] you can't have Redemption without the
[34:02] female right with in other words God has
[34:04] you have to play both parts Hallelujah
[34:06] you have the major chords and the minors
[34:07] right Malachi is that right he's like
[34:09] well maybe dad you know how I can't
[34:12] correct it right now you're preaching
[34:13] you know thanks son appreciate that he's
[34:17] very kind to
[34:18] me and so it's this this feminine
[34:22] attribute that God builds in here and I
[34:25] think it's good once a year to remember
[34:27] that Hallelujah
[34:28] these have been wonderful messages I've
[34:30] enjoyed them over the years I preached
[34:32] on this one a few years ago uh Ezekiel
[34:35] 1910 this beautiful one I think I shared
[34:37] this with sister Naomi in a prayer line
[34:38] a couple weeks
[34:41] ago Ezekiel
[34:45] 1910 give a moment there thy mother is
[34:48] like a Vine in thy
[34:51] blood planted By the Waters that means
[34:54] this Vine has plenty of water there's
[34:56] plenty of life
[34:59] of your mother inside of
[35:01] you she was fruitful and full of
[35:04] branches by reason of many
[35:08] Waters okay so we get this
[35:10] idea right uh of the mother's influence
[35:14] in someone's
[35:15] life right the Bible said our mother is
[35:18] a New Jerusalem glory amen like a woman
[35:22] descending down from heaven and that
[35:24] means motherland hallelujah praise God
[35:27] that's our Mother Land that's where we
[35:28] came from that's where we're going
[35:30] hallelujah
[35:32] amen
[35:35] glory and this we
[35:38] see a child you have a part of you
[35:41] that's always going to be influenced by
[35:43] your
[35:44] mother Hallelujah and we see it in 2
[35:48] Timothy 1
[35:49] verse5 Paul said I've seen Faith uh in
[35:53] your your mother Lois and your
[35:55] grandmother Unice or they got to mixed
[35:57] up there yeah mother Eunice and
[35:58] grandmother Lois and I'm also persuaded
[36:02] I see it in you too because your mother
[36:05] is like a Vine in your blood hallelujah
[36:08] amen glory amen
[36:13] hallelujah so see Church you know our
[36:15] spiritual influence brother Ram said
[36:17] there's a reason that God places the the
[36:20] the the child right there it's right
[36:22] under the mother's heart brother Bram
[36:25] said there's a reason you're close to
[36:27] her
[36:28] heart
[36:30] Hallelujah right and so we see this this
[36:33] idea here uh you've heard this before
[36:36] lots of people say this The Hand That
[36:37] Rocks the Cradle is the hand that rules
[36:40] the
[36:42] nation right that's a famous saying
[36:44] there's been poems about it I think it
[36:46] from the 1800s
[36:49] even and it's so important that God uh
[36:52] you know it's so important that mothers
[36:54] raise their children with The Godly
[36:56] influences of the
[36:58] gospel hallelujah it's so important
[37:02] again because her influence is going to
[37:04] flow right through the
[37:06] child
[37:07] hallelujah it's such an important aspect
[37:10] and so I just love it you know the the
[37:12] faith of Lois flowed into Eunice and
[37:16] that flowed into Timothy it don't say
[37:18] nothing about Timothy's dad was a Greek
[37:20] don't say nothing about him it just says
[37:23] his
[37:24] mom
[37:26] Hallelujah it it's it's really wonderful
[37:28] to see that in other words each one of
[37:31] us you know if we don't have one parent
[37:33] that serves God as long as we got one
[37:36] hallelujah amen amen if we don't have
[37:38] any then we then our spiritual parents
[37:40] were there for us hallelujah because he
[37:44] was always faithful Hallelujah he never
[37:45] left us alone amen watching over our
[37:48] every step Hallelujah protecting us amen
[37:52] guiding us as we go through this Pilgrim
[37:54] Journey praise God like Abraham amen
[37:57] remember oh that's right and Abraham's
[37:58] parents raised him to be an
[38:00] idolator so if you don't have parents
[38:02] that serve god brother amen you're just
[38:04] like Abraham buddy God calls you out
[38:06] with the voice of God Amen
[38:09] Hallelujah follow me amen separate
[38:12] yourself and follow me I'll bless you
[38:15] hallelujah
[38:16] amen
[38:19] amen so it's a great uh lesson here the
[38:23] influence of mother on the children
[38:27] and I want to read a few more here uh
[38:29] also not with husbands so let's go to 1
[38:32] Peter
[38:35] 3:7 before I get back to my title Behold
[38:38] thy
[38:41] mother I'll just start there and then go
[38:43] there in a roundabout way 1 Peter
[38:47] 3 let's look at
[38:49] here you know what let's this is so
[38:52] beautiful let's read verse one it's
[38:53] Mother's Day let's read this likewise ye
[38:55] wives be in subjection to your own
[38:56] husbands that if any obey not the word
[38:59] they also may be without the word be won
[39:02] by the conversation of the wives again
[39:05] we see how if women just live a Godly
[39:08] wonderful Christian Life in front of
[39:09] their husbands they can win them over
[39:12] whether to Salvation or repentance and
[39:14] of course it goes back to God's forn
[39:16] knowledge but this is what the Bible
[39:18] recommends women just serve God wives
[39:21] serve god with Godly reverence and fear
[39:24] and let God do the changing of the heart
[39:26] let Christ live through you that the
[39:28] husband can see him Hallelujah see
[39:31] Christ verse two while they behold your
[39:33] Chase conversation which means
[39:36] Behavior coupled with fear or that's
[39:39] honor for God so if the husband doesn't
[39:42] believe the woman's got to honor God
[39:44] above everything
[39:45] else she has to have Christian Behavior
[39:49] and the husband will the God will work
[39:50] on the husband say this is what real
[39:52] chrisan this is what real character
[39:53] looks
[39:54] like verse three who's adored
[39:59] it says let it not be that outward
[40:02] adorning of plating the hair and of
[40:04] wearing of gold or a putting on of
[40:07] apparel now of course this is uh
[40:09] expensive braiding of the hair right an
[40:11] expensive of course gold and and and
[40:14] expensive apparel we've gone through
[40:16] that verse four but let it be the hidden
[40:18] man of the heart in that which is not
[40:21] corruptible think about that God put
[40:23] something in you when you've got real
[40:25] character it's Incorruptible amen ah
[40:27] Hallelujah when you got the character of
[40:29] Jesus it cannot be corrupted
[40:32] Hallelujah it cannot Fade Away there's
[40:35] eternal life in your soul hallelujah
[40:38] it's Incorruptible praise God now your
[40:40] mind is corruptible but then it can be
[40:42] made new again it's it's got to be
[40:43] transformed daily I'm talking about the
[40:46] very character of who you
[40:48] are what's your main moral decisions
[40:51] every day that's the real character of a
[40:53] Christian Hallelujah Incorruptible
[40:56] Hallelujah
[41:00] Glory even the ornament of a Meek and
[41:02] quiet Spirit which is in the sight of
[41:05] God a great price see how important it
[41:07] is sisters for that Meek and gentle
[41:10] quiet Spirit
[41:11] Hallelujah and you always look at the
[41:13] opposite right always look at these
[41:16] famous women out there in Hollywood look
[41:18] how exact opposite they are they're not
[41:20] Meek they're prideful and they're not
[41:22] quiet they're loud and
[41:25] obnoxious right acting like like a man
[41:28] cutting jokes like men cussing like
[41:30] Sailors all all the things that they
[41:32] do and so our women thank God are the
[41:35] opposite of
[41:36] that and God said that's a great price
[41:40] amen that's I value that very much a
[41:43] Godly woman who's Meek and a quiet
[41:45] Spirit
[41:47] hallelujah amen she can take a command
[41:50] from her husband and say thank you honey
[41:52] right she can take a request from her
[41:54] husband
[41:55] Hallelujah Hal huah because that's what
[41:58] it says later on Lord she calls him Lord
[42:01] not of course that's don't have to
[42:03] literally say that verse five for after
[42:06] this manner in the old time the holy
[42:07] women also who trusted in God adore
[42:10] themselves being in subjection under
[42:11] their own husbands now look they trusted
[42:13] God that God gave them the right
[42:16] husband and so I'm going to trust how
[42:18] God's leading him because I trust
[42:21] God right God said God Christ man woman
[42:26] I trust God amen so God's leading me
[42:29] through this and even if we make a
[42:31] mistake just like Sarah she just keeps
[42:33] trusting God Abraham made a few mistakes
[42:36] he she kept trusting God Amen Abraham
[42:39] said she did they weren't married twice
[42:41] right and she got taken over into
[42:43] another man's home but she still trusted
[42:48] God oh my Mercy thank God for mercy and
[42:51] Grace
[42:53] Hallelujah he
[42:55] says so being in rection your own
[42:57] husband so trust in God trust what God
[43:00] has done let what God has joined
[43:01] together let not man put us under
[43:04] Hallelujah verse six even as Sarah also
[43:07] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord ruler
[43:09] whose daughters ye are as long as you do
[43:11] well and are not afraid with any
[43:15] amazement so that that's extreme fear we
[43:18] can't let extreme fear overcome us right
[43:22] that amazement that
[43:24] fear so that that's what the Bible tells
[43:27] our
[43:28] sisters here and remember uh I just want
[43:30] to bring this out since I mentioned it
[43:32] Lord Lord means ruler and so we we had
[43:35] some preaching on this the Bible said ye
[43:37] are Gods so I just want to just remind
[43:39] you of that when the Bible says ye are
[43:42] Gods it means you are Judges or rulers
[43:45] in the
[43:47] Hebrew so when when someone's preaching
[43:49] on ye are gods and the word of God comes
[43:52] to us and if we apply that to ourselves
[43:53] now remember I showed you on a Wednesday
[43:55] night sermon a couple years ago that
[43:57] there are verses that call Israel their
[44:00] gods but that just means they they were
[44:02] judges they were
[44:04] rulers in other words God gave them the
[44:06] wisdom to judge
[44:09] situations but they didn't walk around
[44:11] saying hey we're a bunch of
[44:13] gods that just that could cause people
[44:15] to
[44:16] stumble right so that's why maybe we
[44:20] just want to be careful how much we amen
[44:22] you know on on gods you are
[44:24] Gods right because someone might say you
[44:27] are gods and you'll s there and say yes
[44:29] that's right we are Gods amen and then
[44:31] you walk out and you sin well you don't
[44:33] look very much Godlike in that you
[44:36] know it it just can bring some reproach
[44:39] okay and especially when we're in a
[44:40] season of people trying they're trying
[44:42] to find fault that's why I want to bring
[44:44] that balance out because they're
[44:45] probably watching now and God bless them
[44:47] help them to repent Hallelujah but yes
[44:50] the Bible said Israel was God's that
[44:52] means they're judges they're rulers amen
[44:54] they're like God in other words they
[44:56] have God Spirit on them so they make
[44:59] decisions based upon God's word
[45:01] hallelujah they have and we have the
[45:03] mind of Christ
[45:05] Hallelujah now we're not prophets as far
[45:08] as us we're not prophets that the word
[45:09] of God comes to like Jesus was talking
[45:12] about ye are Gods to whom the word of
[45:14] God came to we're not prophets but
[45:16] brother brandham was a prophet
[45:18] Hallelujah so was Moses and John the
[45:21] Baptist and all these wonderful prophets
[45:22] of God but the Bible says we're judges
[45:25] we're rulers and the Bible said he
[45:27] that's spiritual judges all
[45:29] things Hallelujah so I'm trying to show
[45:31] you yes you know you we are Gods we're
[45:34] Godlike when we take the mind of Christ
[45:37] but we don't walk around calling
[45:38] ourselves Gods okay so that's my five
[45:40] minutes on that here by God's grace just
[45:42] a good
[45:45] reminder and that's why I like to say my
[45:47] wife and I were talking about this too a
[45:47] few weeks ago we like to say I'm a part
[45:50] of God I wouldn't say I am God I would
[45:53] say I'm a part of God I wouldn't say I
[45:57] am the word I would say I'm a part of
[45:59] the word because there's only one person
[46:01] that's God there's only one person that
[46:03] can say I am the
[46:05] word so that that's why I just like to
[46:07] differentiate that because I don't want
[46:09] to get into the pride element of I don't
[46:12] want to battle Pride right I want to
[46:14] keep Pride at
[46:17] Bay because let me follow around for one
[46:20] day I'll find areas where you're not
[46:22] like God just like you'll find areas
[46:24] where I'm not like God I Hallelujah and
[46:27] we don't want to become puffed up in our
[46:29] carnal Minds right we want to be
[46:31] transformed by the renewing of our
[46:33] mind okay so uh so Abraham was called
[46:37] Lord by Sarah or ruler honey you're my
[46:40] ruler you're my head in other words
[46:41] you're my head I'm trust in God God gave
[46:44] you to me Hallelujah verse seven
[46:48] likewise ye husbands dwell with them so
[46:50] likewise so just as Sarah was respectful
[46:53] like this like uh and Abraham ruled over
[46:56] Sarah by God's word likewise ye husbands
[46:59] dwell with them according to knowledge
[47:00] or understanding that's the mature
[47:02] Christian
[47:05] understanding giving honor unto the wife
[47:07] as unto the weaker
[47:09] vessel see that's why every Christian
[47:12] Church they must give honor to the
[47:14] women right because they're weaker and
[47:17] if if churches aren't careful they'll
[47:19] dishonor the weaker the strong will rule
[47:21] over the weak in abusive ways and so God
[47:25] said you stronger ones make sure you
[47:27] honor the weaker ones so they're not
[47:29] mistreated because they're still God's
[47:31] people they're still God's attributes
[47:34] amen Allelujah and every attribute is
[47:36] important to
[47:38] God remember God told that one
[47:41] woman because she spent a Year's wages
[47:44] on the alabaster
[47:46] box and because she broke that my and
[47:51] poured a Year's wages what do you make a
[47:52] year like don't say that
[47:54] loud let's just say 100,000 I make a h
[47:57] 100,000 a year
[47:59] imagine coming to church and giving a
[48:02] $100 giving all your wages at a church
[48:06] service 100,000 I'm giving it all I made
[48:08] this year I'm giving up for
[48:10] Jesus that's what this woman did when
[48:12] she broke the alabaster box I'm giving a
[48:15] Year's wages and that devil Spirit looks
[48:18] and says oh what a waste this is what a
[48:22] waste this could have been given to the
[48:23] poor and the whole time he didn't even
[48:25] care about the poor but Jesus looks up
[48:27] and said leave her alone Satan amen
[48:30] leave this woman alone let this woman
[48:33] worship amen let this woman sacrificed
[48:35] Hallelujah and Jesus said because she's
[48:37] done this the preachers will preach
[48:39] about her for the next 2,000 years until
[48:41] the Rapture amen what other verse do you
[48:43] know where the Bible says that about a
[48:46] man God used a weaker vessel a hum more
[48:49] humble vessel God used his weaker vessel
[48:51] and then he magnifies his weaker vessel
[48:57] Lord Jesus I just want to pour this
[48:59] offering on your head I just want your
[49:00] feet to be anointed for burial I just
[49:02] want you to be prepared for
[49:05] burial so I'm going to pour out of
[49:07] myself a whole Year's wages on
[49:10] you talk about a
[49:12] sacrifice
[49:16] Hallelujah now I'm not telling you to
[49:17] bring all your wages to church everybody
[49:19] understand
[49:20] that today's not my day to start being a
[49:22] Prosperity preacher I don't have any
[49:24] plans to ever start that
[49:27] I'm I'm I'm magnifying the weaker vessel
[49:30] giving such a large
[49:33] sacrifice think about that you know a
[49:35] Year's worth of wages All in One Moment
[49:37] In One Moment somebody could pour out a
[49:40] Year's worth of work of course you
[49:42] wasn't doing good work
[49:44] here but God saw the sacrifice God saw
[49:47] the desire I want to I want to redeem
[49:50] this year my goodness my goodness I want
[49:53] to redeem it Hallelujah
[49:58] hallelujah thank you Jesus God God Is So
[50:03] merciful
[50:05] Hallelujah giving honor to the wife as
[50:07] under the weaker vessel and as being HS
[50:10] together of the grace of God so husbands
[50:11] must look like we're in this together
[50:13] praise
[50:14] God we're all La you and I are laboring
[50:18] for the same goal for Eternal rewards
[50:22] Hallelujah Jesus said remember Jesus
[50:24] said don't store up Treasures on this
[50:26] Earth he said store them up in
[50:28] heaven and so if your wife's with you
[50:30] then then that should be our goal to
[50:31] store up Treasures in Heaven not on this
[50:33] Earth where moth and dust doth
[50:39] corrupt and finally that your prayers be
[50:42] not
[50:44] hindered so there is an element here if
[50:46] a man mistreats his
[50:49] wife if a man treats his mistreats his
[50:52] wife then his prayers are not even heard
[50:54] God doesn't collect them remember God
[50:55] collected corneo his prayers in a
[50:58] bowl he collected all these but God said
[51:01] I'm not going to collect your prayers if
[51:03] you don't treat your wife the right
[51:05] way heaven's got to have no record of
[51:07] their prayers think about that taking no
[51:09] record Angels aren't listening I'm not
[51:12] going to hear them so see church God is
[51:15] watching over his
[51:18] daughters
[51:19] Hallelujah he's watching all over his
[51:21] precious little daughters amen that he
[51:23] places on this Earth that man don't
[51:25] treat her good he's going to get paid
[51:27] he's going to get he's going to get
[51:28] rebuked for
[51:29] it
[51:31] right God watches over his people
[51:33] hallelujah he cares no one cares like
[51:36] the Lord amen we should cast our cares
[51:39] on him because of how much he cares for
[51:41] us
[51:42] hallelujah
[51:46] amen and look at you know just verse
[51:48] eight I'm just throwing it in there
[51:49] because it's so beautiful finally be ye
[51:51] all of One mind having compassion one
[51:53] for another so that's what husband
[51:55] should have they should have compassion
[51:56] on the weaker vessels talking about
[51:58] mothers and children as
[52:00] well love as Brethren be pitiful be
[52:04] courious have pity on your church
[52:08] family be courteous not rendering evil
[52:11] for evil if someone does me wrong this
[52:14] is my time to get back at them right
[52:16] that's not what a Christian a Christian
[52:17] doesn't wait for a chance to get back a
[52:19] Christian looks for a chance to be
[52:21] good to be pitiful amen that's the word
[52:24] right there to show pity amen I pity
[52:27] them I feel bad for them they're
[52:29] mistreating me like
[52:32] this but contrary rise give a blessing
[52:34] knowing that ye are there un to called
[52:36] that you should inherit a blessing go to
[52:39] Malachi 21:14 Malachi 214 if you got
[52:41] your Bible there this always reminds me
[52:43] this I went through this a few weeks
[52:54] ago now just for background in verses 11
[52:57] 12 and 13 of Malachi
[53:00] 2 Judah and Israel had profaned the
[53:02] Holiness of God because they married a
[53:04] strange God in other words they were
[53:06] worshiping
[53:08] idols and God said in verse 12 I'll cut
[53:10] off the man that does this the master of
[53:12] the
[53:13] scholar who offer these offerings they
[53:17] were offering offerings to God and
[53:20] Idols but God wants us to love him
[53:23] only he wants us to have holy love which
[53:26] means separate or sacred God wants us to
[53:29] set apart all of our love for
[53:31] him
[53:33] Hallelujah now look at verse 13 I'm
[53:35] going to read this too this has struck
[53:36] me and this have ye done again covering
[53:39] the altar Lord with tears weeping and
[53:41] with crying out in so much that
[53:42] regardeth I'm sorry in so much that he
[53:44] regardeth not the offering anymore or
[53:46] receiveth it with Good Will at your hand
[53:49] so they would come and they would give
[53:50] you know the the Bullocks or the turtle
[53:52] does or the Lambs they would give that
[53:54] and even cry on the altar now church
[53:56] when was the last time you cried in your
[53:58] chair or cried on the Altar and it was
[54:00] hopefully it wasn't that long ago I'm
[54:02] just saying look what they would do they
[54:04] would cry in God's presence and tears
[54:06] would actually hit the altar but then
[54:08] they would go and worship
[54:10] idols and God said I'm not accepting
[54:12] that I don't in other words goes back to
[54:15] that beautiful principle it's Godly
[54:17] sorrow versus worldly
[54:19] sorrow and God wants us to have Godly
[54:22] sorrow just getting caught uh shouldn't
[54:26] that that that that that's bad we should
[54:28] be sorrowful about that but we should be
[54:30] sorrowful and say God help me to never
[54:31] do it again Hallelujah Godly sorrow
[54:34] workers repentance Hallelujah but Israel
[54:37] wasn't doing that they were sad they got
[54:39] caught they're probably sad their
[54:40] animals are dying because their
[54:41] continual addiction to sin right crying
[54:45] and God said I'm not having any of it
[54:47] and the same men that did this were the
[54:49] same men that were abusing their wives
[54:51] at home because they were
[54:53] demon-possessed right worshiping devils
[54:56] and then trying to worship God is that
[54:58] amazing people can come to church and
[55:00] they can sing and worship but then they
[55:02] can go out and worship the devil too
[55:04] just like
[55:05] balam right sometimes you do
[55:07] enchantments sometimes he seek God is't
[55:10] that crazy people can do that Jesus said
[55:12] if you can't make one bitter he said
[55:14] make he said can't don't have sweet
[55:16] water and bitter water make it all sweet
[55:18] Hallelujah either make it all bitter or
[55:20] make it all sweet Lord make my life all
[55:22] sweet to you
[55:25] Hallelujah God help me to overcome sin
[55:27] and Temptation
[55:29] Hallelujah help me just to give a
[55:31] beautiful pure sacrifice of my life unto
[55:34] you
[55:36] Lord he said how can evil flow out of
[55:39] how can good flow out of evil
[55:41] mouths how can a good tree bring corrupt
[55:44] fruit it can't make it one or the other
[55:46] he says but that's what was happening
[55:48] here in the days of Malachi this was uh
[55:51] 397 years before Christ or somewhere
[55:53] right in there about 400 years before
[55:55] Christ
[55:57] verse 14 yet you say wherefore why won't
[55:59] God receive our worship because the Lord
[56:01] has been a witness between thee and the
[56:02] wife of thy youth now look at that see
[56:04] that that's what it's always the case
[56:06] whenever idolatry and sin comes in a
[56:08] man's life it's always going to mess up
[56:10] his home
[56:12] life right always either sooner or later
[56:15] it's going to mess it up I don't care
[56:18] how long they hide it Jesus said
[56:19] whatever is done in secret it's going to
[56:20] be shoted from the mountain
[56:22] tops that's right you can only hide it
[56:25] for so long
[56:26] it's going to come out right look at
[56:30] this God was a witness so when it seemed
[56:34] like it was there was no Witnesses if a
[56:35] sister was was mistreated if it seemed
[56:38] like nobody was watching God was
[56:39] watching the whole
[56:41] time he said I'm a witness between you
[56:45] mistreating
[56:47] her right God watched the whole thing
[56:51] see and so it didn't matter to God if
[56:53] these men would mistreat their wives and
[56:54] come and try to give a sacrifice God
[56:56] said I'm not receiving it if you can't
[56:59] live the life in your home then it
[57:00] doesn't matter what you do if you can't
[57:01] do it in secret I'm not accepting your
[57:03] public
[57:04] worship
[57:05] amen hallelujah that's why we've said it
[57:08] before but your way you live at your
[57:10] house is more important than what you do
[57:11] here when you come to church amen
[57:13] hallelujah praise God your Worship in
[57:16] your home your sacrifices in your
[57:18] private life that's more important than
[57:19] what you do here hallelujah may this
[57:22] just be a further expression of what you
[57:24] do in your home Hallelujah let it just
[57:27] be a continuation Hallelujah of how we
[57:29] live our lives in our
[57:33] home all right everybody glad to have
[57:35] the pastor back after three weeks off on
[57:38] Sun at least on Sunday
[57:41] morning whom thou has dealt
[57:43] treacherously so this man was a awful
[57:45] man treacherous against his
[57:48] wife yet is she thy companion and the
[57:51] wife of thy
[57:53] Covenant don't don't mistreat your
[57:55] companion
[57:57] don't mistreat this person that I've
[57:58] joined you
[58:01] together and did he not make once of God
[58:04] goes back to this you're supposed to be
[58:05] one
[58:07] Spirit he goes back to Adam and
[58:10] Eve Hallelujah yet he had the residue of
[58:13] his spirit and wherefore one that he
[58:15] might make or seek a Godly seed
[58:18] therefore take heed to your spirit and
[58:20] let none deal treacherously against the
[58:22] wife of his
[58:24] youth P there's all times let's let take
[58:26] a we can all take a good warning from
[58:27] that right husband or wife I know it's
[58:29] Mother's Day I might as well preach
[58:31] Father's Day Too here while I'm here
[58:33] right we all there's all time there's
[58:36] times for all of us rather where we need
[58:38] to take heed and make sure do I have the
[58:39] right spirit with my husband or
[58:42] wife do I have the right spirit with my
[58:44] children or my grandchildren if we're
[58:47] grandparents Hallelujah let's not leave
[58:49] anybody out
[58:50] today you know it's good just take
[58:53] heed examine yourself whether you be in
[58:55] the faith Paul says in 2 Corinthians 13
[58:58] hallelujah it's a good reminder for all
[59:00] of us that God's watching all of our our
[59:04] conversations God's watching how we
[59:06] treat one another verse 16 for the Lord
[59:08] the god of Israel saith that he hateth
[59:10] putting away for one
[59:14] coverthe saith the Lord of hosts
[59:17] therefore take heed to your spirit that
[59:18] you de deal not treacherously
[59:23] right see God wants to make sure we
[59:25] treat each other the right way with the
[59:27] kindness of the Holy Spirit and God
[59:30] hates
[59:31] divorce the Bible said God permitted it
[59:34] because their hearts were so hard amen
[59:37] and he knew they didn't have the remedy
[59:39] for a hurt heart they didn't have the
[59:41] Holy Ghost in the soul so God permitted
[59:44] it because their hearts would get so
[59:46] incredibly hard it'd be better to
[59:48] divorce and at least be separated from
[59:50] this hard-hearted man that was God's
[59:53] mercy is't that something that's what
[59:56] Jesus said in Matthew 19 he said God
[59:58] permitted it because of the hardness of
[59:59] your hearts you
[1:00:02] men right because if I'm not mistaken
[1:00:04] women couldn't do the divorce in the Old
[1:00:06] Testament a man had to do it if I'm not
[1:00:09] mistaken so somebody correct me
[1:00:10] afterwards that's that's some correction
[1:00:12] I do want by God's grace I want all the
[1:00:13] correction that God has for me though
[1:00:15] don't get me
[1:00:16] wrong and so God tells them you men had
[1:00:19] the hard
[1:00:21] Hearts so God said I'll be a witness
[1:00:26] let's read verse 17 we might well this
[1:00:27] beautiful verse ye have wearied the Lord
[1:00:29] with your words see these men they would
[1:00:31] talk so much in church but then they
[1:00:32] wouldn't live the life at home God said
[1:00:35] I'm weary with all your words at
[1:00:37] church right don't put on a false show
[1:00:40] at church treat your wife
[1:00:43] right yet ye say wherein have we wearied
[1:00:46] him when you say everyone that doeth
[1:00:48] evil is good in the sight of the Lord
[1:00:50] and He Delight in him or where is the
[1:00:53] god of judgment so they're making evil
[1:00:55] good and good evil and other men were
[1:00:58] saying where is God just like we talked
[1:01:00] about well where is God in my generation
[1:01:03] God hasn't showed up for me remember
[1:01:04] that's what Kanye West said he was
[1:01:05] trying to serve Jesus for a few years he
[1:01:07] flipped now and now he said Jesus didn't
[1:01:10] show up for me when I needed him so he
[1:01:11] said I'm My Own God he
[1:01:14] said but see you can't that's not a true
[1:01:18] conversion a true conversion is I know
[1:01:21] the The Old Rugged Cross was for me
[1:01:23] praise God I deserve the cross but he
[1:01:25] took my my place amen and no matter what
[1:01:28] he and his wisdom allows to come to pass
[1:01:30] I'm still trusting in his sacrifice he
[1:01:32] died for me I deserved the cross but he
[1:01:34] took it for me Hallelujah so I'll devote
[1:01:37] the rest of my life to serving him
[1:01:39] because God commanded his love wherewith
[1:01:42] Christ died the righteous for the
[1:01:43] unrighteous the righteous died for the
[1:01:45] sinner I'm a sinner and Jesus died for
[1:01:48] me so I owe him my life Hallelujah
[1:01:58] now I don't know if this is true but I
[1:01:59] found this on a Church website but
[1:02:01] Abraham Lincoln said apparently all that
[1:02:03] I am or hope to be I owe to my
[1:02:07] mother I don't know that seems go along
[1:02:10] with brother R's stories I'm I just
[1:02:11] found it right before service so I was
[1:02:13] just thought my that's quite a statement
[1:02:16] hallelujah how many people in the Bible
[1:02:17] could say that right Timothy could say
[1:02:19] that Hallelujah brother Braham said it
[1:02:21] was jocked that told Moses you're the
[1:02:24] deliverer the angel the Lord told me
[1:02:27] hallelujah praise God Amen the angel
[1:02:29] told me Moses Out of Water God protected
[1:02:34] you amen his mother put all these
[1:02:37] promises in his heart
[1:02:39] hallelujah
[1:02:41] amen and I would say like that for
[1:02:43] myself too you know my dad taught me the
[1:02:45] greatest lesson but the majority of
[1:02:47] lessons I learned were from my
[1:02:52] mother so I thank God uh that your
[1:02:55] mother my mother's like a Vine that's in
[1:02:57] me hallelujah
[1:03:04] hallelujah okay I'm almost at an hour
[1:03:05] wow hard to believe now I want to look
[1:03:07] at a few verses go to Luke 21:19 H Luke
[1:03:09] 2:19 I want to now let's move down to
[1:03:11] Mary we'll try to bring this here to a
[1:03:13] little close by
[1:03:14] God's the next few
[1:03:17] minutes Luke 2:19 now of course we were
[1:03:20] familiar with these stories but the
[1:03:21] Bible said but Mary kept all these
[1:03:23] things and pondered them in her heart
[1:03:27] lukee
[1:03:30] 2:19 this is the thought I want to get
[1:03:32] to here at the end is the just this
[1:03:36] character of Mary Luke
[1:03:40] 2:19 this of course was after the birth
[1:03:43] of Jesus and the Adoration of the
[1:03:45] Shepherds
[1:03:47] Hallelujah so she brought forth Christ
[1:03:49] and then the Shepherds come and the
[1:03:51] Shepherds were talking about all these
[1:03:53] angels singing and the the Shepherds
[1:03:56] were so moved these are the lowest
[1:03:57] people in
[1:03:58] society and they they said we're going
[1:04:00] to go into Bethlehem we're going to go
[1:04:02] into Jerusalem wherever we go we're
[1:04:03] going to go we're going to tell
[1:04:04] everybody about this special
[1:04:06] birth
[1:04:08] Hallelujah is that something you know
[1:04:10] they came in there and they they leave
[1:04:12] out with this amazing testimonies praise
[1:04:14] God we saw the Christ child and so this
[1:04:17] was such a a a amazing thing to her the
[1:04:20] Bible said she heard all them and then
[1:04:22] she kept them in her heart and pondered
[1:04:25] them in her
[1:04:27] heart let's do that
[1:04:29] today let's remember when God has spoken
[1:04:32] to us let's remember when God has done
[1:04:35] something for us and let's keep
[1:04:37] pondering that in our
[1:04:39] hearts Hallelujah in other words let's
[1:04:41] not forget what God has spoken to us
[1:04:44] let's remember what he's done for us
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:47] hallelujah she could have got distracted
[1:04:49] with all these other think about that as
[1:04:50] a mother or a wife think about how many
[1:04:52] things we could get distracted with but
[1:04:54] yet she said I'm going to keep this in
[1:04:56] my
[1:04:57] heart see that just proves we're going
[1:04:59] to keep something in our heart and we
[1:05:01] want it to be the right thing Church
[1:05:04] Hallelujah think about the years went by
[1:05:06] years went by and she kept that moment
[1:05:09] amen that special moment Hallelujah man
[1:05:12] God help us Amen to keep spiritual
[1:05:16] situations spiritual testimonies God
[1:05:18] help us to keep them in our hearts
[1:05:21] amen hallelujah that we remember what
[1:05:25] God has done
[1:05:26] that we don't forget his faithfulness
[1:05:28] Hallelujah because there are so many
[1:05:30] days are just regular and paying the
[1:05:32] bills and going to work and eating and
[1:05:34] drinking and sleeping and all these
[1:05:35] things we do but Mary didn't focus on
[1:05:38] that she focused on God visited me
[1:05:40] Hallelujah God sent Shepherds Hallelujah
[1:05:43] God gave us a dream of angels I'm
[1:05:45] keeping these things in my heart amen
[1:05:48] and remember she had at least six other
[1:05:51] children about ready to slap and say
[1:05:53] Amen about ready to slap a wall right
[1:05:57] amen she had at least seven children but
[1:06:00] she chose to keep these things in her
[1:06:03] heart not the disappointments of life
[1:06:06] and not Joseph's death
[1:06:08] either history says she died he died at
[1:06:10] some point and she was a widow but we
[1:06:13] don't know what remember even by the
[1:06:14] time Jesus was ministering the Bible
[1:06:16] said your mother and your brethren come
[1:06:18] to see you not your father of course he
[1:06:20] was never they really weren't father
[1:06:22] mother anyway right God was the
[1:06:24] father but by that time Joseph had
[1:06:26] already died and think about that she
[1:06:29] could have kept all these other things
[1:06:30] in her heart oh I'm a widow my husband's
[1:06:33] died but the Bible said she kept God's
[1:06:36] presence in her
[1:06:37] heart amen
[1:06:40] hallelujah what did she keep in her
[1:06:42] heart brother
[1:06:44] Jesse she kept the testimony of the
[1:06:47] Shepherds in her heart that they said
[1:06:49] they heard Angels Sing glory to God in
[1:06:51] the highest and on Earth peace and Good
[1:06:53] Will toward men
[1:06:57] Hallelujah that's what she kept in her
[1:06:59] heart the scripture says isn't that
[1:07:01] beautiful
[1:07:03] Hallelujah I bring you good tidings of
[1:07:06] great joy for unto you is born in this
[1:07:08] city of David a savior which is Christ
[1:07:11] the Lord amen so she chose to keep the
[1:07:14] prophecy about the savior in her heart
[1:07:17] and church we got to keep the prophecy
[1:07:19] about the Rapture in our heart amen the
[1:07:22] son is coming Hallelujah she could say
[1:07:25] the son is here amen but we could say
[1:07:27] the sun is coming Hallelujah I know the
[1:07:30] spirit of the sun is in our hearts but
[1:07:32] we're talking about the literal Corporal
[1:07:33] body the glorified body of Jesus Christ
[1:07:36] is coming hallelujah oh keep that in our
[1:07:39] hearts
[1:07:41] amen by
[1:07:43] Hallelujah so we got a choice what are
[1:07:45] we going to keep in our hearts let's
[1:07:46] learn from this mother of seven at least
[1:07:49] seven and a brother told me this week I
[1:07:51] don't know if the he's a preacher I
[1:07:53] can't remember his name but the brother
[1:07:56] told me he said I was studying or it was
[1:07:57] last
[1:07:58] week and he said uh a quiver the Bible
[1:08:01] said a husband a man's got his quiver
[1:08:03] full he said a quiver of arrows holds
[1:08:05] four or five
[1:08:07] arrows happy is a man who's got his
[1:08:09] quiver full so Mary had well over a
[1:08:11] quiver she had seven or I'm sorry at
[1:08:14] least was at least seven at least
[1:08:16] seven she had more than a quiver
[1:08:19] full but she said I'm going to keep the
[1:08:22] Son of God I'm going to keep the Messiah
[1:08:24] in my heart
[1:08:26] so I told Brother William I said I kind
[1:08:27] of got two Quivers
[1:08:28] buddy one's full one's partial
[1:08:31] full one's the other ones that should be
[1:08:33] there they're in heaven
[1:08:35] Hallelujah like uh Victoria Drew one day
[1:08:38] right
[1:08:39] Victoria we'll see him Hallelujah by
[1:08:41] God's
[1:08:43] grace and then you know the Luke Chapter
[1:08:45] 2 goes through the circumcision of Jesus
[1:08:47] the Adoration uh Simeon as uh scoffield
[1:08:51] says and then the Adoration of Anna now
[1:08:52] put up verse 51 Luke 251
[1:09:00] now this is of course after Jesus was
[1:09:03] left uh at Jerusalem they leave you
[1:09:05] remember the story and they say where's
[1:09:06] Jesus they had to go all the way back
[1:09:10] right and uh they asked him that
[1:09:12] question thy mother or thy father and I
[1:09:15] have sought thee with soring so his mom
[1:09:16] asked your dad and I have been look for
[1:09:18] you and he said how is that that you
[1:09:21] sought me wish you know that it must be
[1:09:23] about my father's business and brother B
[1:09:25] said look the word always corrects the
[1:09:28] HS she was claiming Joseph was his
[1:09:32] father but Jesus says no I'm about my
[1:09:34] father's business
[1:09:39] Hallelujah and then what happened the
[1:09:41] Bible say verse 51 and he went down unto
[1:09:44] I'm sorry went down with them and came
[1:09:45] to Nazareth and was subject unto them
[1:09:47] but his mother kept all these thingss in
[1:09:49] her heart so these
[1:09:52] Supernatural spiritual moments that Mary
[1:09:55] had she kept she chose to keep those
[1:09:57] things in her heart and not all the
[1:10:00] Pains of
[1:10:01] life right not not all the people that
[1:10:04] had mistreated her and called her names
[1:10:06] remember brother B said when she brought
[1:10:08] um Jesus to be circumcised all the
[1:10:10] mothers were saying oh he's an
[1:10:12] illegitimate child remember was talking
[1:10:14] about that she's got she's illegit
[1:10:17] that's illegitimate child child that
[1:10:19] baby's born out of bed or wedlock
[1:10:21] actually sorry
[1:10:23] wedlock and Jesus and Jesus Jesus had a
[1:10:25] bad name Mary and Joseph they all had
[1:10:27] bad names she didn't keep all the pain
[1:10:29] in her heart she didn't keep being
[1:10:30] mistreated at church in her heart she
[1:10:32] kept the promises of God in her heart
[1:10:35] that's a Mother's Day lesson we can
[1:10:36] learn don't worry that's a lesson I need
[1:10:38] to learn amen keep the right things in
[1:10:41] our hearts Hallelujah the word of God
[1:10:44] Amen I know God visited me there I know
[1:10:47] God did that I believe God will fulfill
[1:10:49] it God will come Jesus is going to come
[1:10:51] Hallelujah and I want to live to see it
[1:10:53] by the grace of God hallelujah
[1:10:56] so that in my flesh I shall see God
[1:10:59] hallelujah oh my imagine imagine seeing
[1:11:02] Jesus in the sky in our flesh we shall
[1:11:05] see God hallelujah oh my it'd be the
[1:11:08] most privileged thing we could ever see
[1:11:10] with our
[1:11:14] eyes
[1:11:16] Hallelujah and so notice she kept these
[1:11:18] things in her heart no doubt Satan the
[1:11:21] Bible says in Matthew 13 Satan's always
[1:11:23] trying to snatch the word of God out of
[1:11:25] our our
[1:11:26] hearts right the Bible said the words
[1:11:28] God's like a serwer he Jesus SWS the
[1:11:30] words the Holy Spirit SWS the words and
[1:11:33] if we're not careful sometimes Church
[1:11:34] things get snatched out of our hearts
[1:11:37] that's why we need a transformed mind
[1:11:39] amen Lord change this state bring the
[1:11:42] bring the old days back bring the first
[1:11:44] love back Hallelujah bring your promises
[1:11:47] bring those give me more experiences
[1:11:49] with the Holy Spirit Hallelujah bring it
[1:11:51] back
[1:11:53] amen Mary would said no
[1:11:55] I'm not going to let that get snatched
[1:11:59] out I'm starting to get warm
[1:12:01] sorry I'm going take this off
[1:12:05] sooner she kept and we sing that song
[1:12:07] you know she kept these things and
[1:12:08] Ponder them deep within her heart she
[1:12:11] didn't let Satan snatch it out so church
[1:12:12] we can't uh we have to remember we got
[1:12:15] to keep the Lord in our heart in our
[1:12:17] constant thoughts remember the good
[1:12:20] times amen remember the times you knew
[1:12:22] God's spirit came on you Hallelujah keep
[1:12:25] that in your heart
[1:12:27] Hallelujah right CU if not what the
[1:12:29] Bible what there's only one other
[1:12:30] alternative it's the roots of bitterness
[1:12:33] you're going to have something planted
[1:12:34] in your heart and so we want to have joy
[1:12:37] in our hearts amen we want to have peace
[1:12:39] and patience and hope for a future amen
[1:12:42] those are the things we want planted in
[1:12:43] our hearts
[1:12:45] Hallelujah don't let the devil snatch it
[1:12:47] up so Mary is a perfect example oh ties
[1:12:51] and purpose Psalm 1 verse2 but his
[1:12:53] Delight is in the law of the Lord
[1:12:55] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[1:12:58] night Mary's a female example of this
[1:13:00] because remember she's like a Vine
[1:13:02] planted in your blood Hallelujah she's
[1:13:05] like a tree Amen in your blood
[1:13:07] Hallelujah the
[1:13:09] faith so see that's what Mary did she's
[1:13:12] like a spiritual tree but she stayed
[1:13:15] planted but she kept her mind on the
[1:13:17] word of God all the
[1:13:20] time she remember she remember to choose
[1:13:23] to think about the right things of Life
[1:13:24] the the good things of Life meditate
[1:13:27] upon God's promises for your
[1:13:34] life verse three and he shall be like a
[1:13:36] tree planted by the rivers of water and
[1:13:38] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[1:13:40] season his Leaf also shall not wither
[1:13:43] whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:13:47] prosper isn't that something church I
[1:13:49] think it's just something that and I I
[1:13:51] made a video about this there's five New
[1:13:52] Testament Believers where you can see
[1:13:54] they were saved Sanctified and filled
[1:13:56] with the Holy Ghost Mary's one of
[1:13:59] them she was saved before she even
[1:14:02] conceived Jesus by the Holy Ghost
[1:14:04] because once she found out she said oh I
[1:14:06] rejoice in God my
[1:14:09] savior I'm already saved Hallelujah
[1:14:12] under the blood of bulls and goats I'm
[1:14:14] already saved hallelujah
[1:14:17] amen so we believe she's probably a
[1:14:19] teenager around 15 or
[1:14:22] 16 right and then she got to go through
[1:14:24] 30 some more 30 or 33 years of Jesus's
[1:14:28] life so she's 48 she's around 48 47 445
[1:14:34] I'm still 43 brother so think about that
[1:14:36] Mary was older than me and still have
[1:14:38] the Holy Ghost well if I've got it I
[1:14:40] ought to act like it amen I ought to
[1:14:42] enjoy it praise God hallelujah I ought
[1:14:45] to keep the word of God in my heart
[1:14:46] Hallelujah that's what church is good
[1:14:48] for Hallelujah that's what the Holy
[1:14:50] Ghost is good
[1:14:51] for thank God Amen Hallelujah
[1:14:56] so by she's already saved by the time
[1:14:58] she's
[1:14:58] 15 but she doesn't get the Holy Ghost
[1:15:01] for 33 more
[1:15:03] years that's a long period of
[1:15:05] sanctification brother William that's a
[1:15:07] long time walk in the wilderness sister
[1:15:09] Lena the tipe leaving Egypt Wilderness
[1:15:13] crossing over Jordan that's a long time
[1:15:16] around this Wilderness but God's with me
[1:15:19] every step of the way amen I couldn't
[1:15:21] even walk unless he was holding my hand
[1:15:24] Hallelujah
[1:15:25] I would not have made it amen except he
[1:15:27] was guiding me constantly
[1:15:30] amen thank you Jesus amen it's a long
[1:15:34] time not to have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:37] Hallelujah
[1:15:38] by she didn't complain all she did was
[1:15:41] keep these things pondered them in her
[1:15:43] heart remember the Bible said also her
[1:15:45] soul would be pierced through and that
[1:15:48] was a prophecy of the cross that we read
[1:15:51] for our text
[1:15:55] that a fresh thought there let me sa
[1:15:57] that for the end let me write that down
[1:15:58] that's pretty
[1:16:02] good
[1:16:04] just fresh
[1:16:08] Revelation well you might not think it's
[1:16:09] so fresh but to me it's pretty good
[1:16:11] there we go all right amen thank God uh
[1:16:14] I'm gonna have to uh shorten this up I
[1:16:16] was telling Zur I was going to preach on
[1:16:18] eating the book uh eating the book uh
[1:16:22] because we've been looking at that so I
[1:16:24] kind of prepared some on that but I'm
[1:16:25] going to save that for maybe Wednesday
[1:16:26] by God's grace because I need to close
[1:16:28] this up it's already 12 by God's
[1:16:30] grace now let's finish up with Mary here
[1:16:32] now we're in Luke yes that's right Luke
[1:16:34] 2 he must be about his father's
[1:16:37] business now I want to just point this
[1:16:39] out too just for our church you know
[1:16:41] Jesus is in the
[1:16:42] temple and he the Bible said he's just
[1:16:45] asking questions and hearing them and
[1:16:48] giving understanding
[1:16:49] answers sound familiar like a questions
[1:16:52] and aners Sunday night service with the
[1:16:53] kids
[1:16:55] and that was God's
[1:16:58] business see because the Bible said he
[1:17:00] had to grow what he had to grow in
[1:17:03] wisdom and spirit and favor with man and
[1:17:08] God you see there are seasons where we
[1:17:10] learn we grow in knowledge and
[1:17:12] understanding and that is God's
[1:17:14] business Hallelujah that is God's
[1:17:17] business there's a time for that Jesus
[1:17:19] went through
[1:17:21] that so I like that that just spoke to
[1:17:24] me about ourchurch Jesus increased in
[1:17:26] wisdom and stature Luke 252 and favor
[1:17:29] with God and man amen hallelujah all
[1:17:34] right now let me get down to this
[1:17:35] closing part here now this may be five
[1:17:36] or 10 15 we'll we'll see and then if I
[1:17:38] sing it maybe half an hour we'll
[1:17:43] see now I'm going to go back to the
[1:17:47] uh let's go back to John
[1:17:50] 20 21 John 21
[1:17:59] yeah I'm just placing that I just seen
[1:18:00] that scripture I want to put a mark
[1:18:07] there all right so back to my text
[1:18:11] here have you enjoyed the word of God
[1:18:13] today it's John 19 I'm sorry John 19
[1:18:29] and I didn't read the quote but brother
[1:18:30] Bram
[1:18:31] said Mary was had virgin Faith he said
[1:18:36] now she was naturally virgin he said but
[1:18:39] she had virgin Faith with just means
[1:18:41] pure Faith another way to say it is
[1:18:43] unfeigned Faith the Bible says in other
[1:18:45] words I'm not pretending about this I'm
[1:18:46] not trying like we said on wedn I'm not
[1:18:48] trying to pump myself I'm not trying to
[1:18:49] believe I just
[1:18:51] believe because it was revealed to me
[1:18:54] amen the Father the Father in Heaven
[1:18:56] Jesus said the Father which is in heaven
[1:18:57] has revealed it unto you Hallelujah and
[1:19:00] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:19:02] us hallelujah because of the power of
[1:19:04] Revelation Hallelujah once it's unveiled
[1:19:07] once it's made known well you see it
[1:19:08] it's plain no doubt about it Hallelujah
[1:19:11] you can't be talked out of it Hallelujah
[1:19:13] God revealed it to me it's John 19 sorry
[1:19:16] I keep saying the wrong word John
[1:19:18] 19 and now we see there in verse 25 we
[1:19:21] see at the foot of the cross there's a
[1:19:23] beautiful song about that the the foot
[1:19:24] of the
[1:19:26] cross who's left all these men Peter
[1:19:30] said I'll never leave you even if they
[1:19:31] kill me I'll never leave you all these
[1:19:32] big Burly there it is man TI again all
[1:19:35] these masculine males all this strong
[1:19:37] part of the the
[1:19:39] Believers they weren't there at the
[1:19:42] cross they said they would be see why
[1:19:45] God needs a weaker part too God needs a
[1:19:48] he needs a contrast am he needs strength
[1:19:52] he needs weakness the weak ones actually
[1:19:55] went with him to the cross and they're
[1:19:57] the first ones there on the resurrection
[1:19:59] morning amen hallelujah praise God Amen
[1:20:02] the weaker
[1:20:04] ones not the stronger ones the weaker
[1:20:07] ones were
[1:20:09] there just something to consider Saints
[1:20:11] in other words if you're weak don't feel
[1:20:12] bad because you're weak God's got a plan
[1:20:14] for
[1:20:15] you if you're strong don't boast about
[1:20:17] it
[1:20:18] amen the Bible said don't boast if
[1:20:20] you're the Gentile Branch well we're
[1:20:21] grafted in and don't boast because
[1:20:23] you'll be cut off
[1:20:28] so we see there
[1:20:30] Jesus his
[1:20:32] mother his mother's
[1:20:34] Sister Mary the wife of cleopas and Mary
[1:20:38] Magdalene I love what the Bible says
[1:20:39] about Mar Mary Magdalene she had seven
[1:20:42] demons but then the Bible said Jesus
[1:20:44] cast them out and Jesus healed her I
[1:20:48] just love that you can have Seven Devils
[1:20:50] you can have all kinds of demonic
[1:20:52] activity but Jesus comes to heal his his
[1:20:54] children oh amen I don't care if it's
[1:20:57] one devil two Devils three four five six
[1:21:00] seven Jesus heals from all demons
[1:21:02] hallelujah hallelujah he can heal broken
[1:21:06] lives amen he restores broken lives
[1:21:08] Hallelujah he can heal the deepest hurts
[1:21:11] Hallelujah because that's why he's here
[1:21:13] amen he's God Almighty Hallelujah he's
[1:21:16] Jehovah Gyra
[1:21:18] Hallelujah you can heal someone who's
[1:21:20] been filled by seven
[1:21:23] demons and and then look you'll love him
[1:21:25] so much you'll go with him to the Garden
[1:21:28] you'll go with him to the Cross
[1:21:29] Hallelujah that song I'll go with him to
[1:21:31] the
[1:21:31] Garden I'll go with him to the Judgment
[1:21:37] amen that's what she does because she's
[1:21:40] been
[1:21:41] healed Hallelujah so if you're healed
[1:21:44] you'll go to the Cross as well too
[1:21:45] Hallelujah if Jesus touched you you'll
[1:21:48] go there as well amen thank you Lord and
[1:21:52] when Jesus therefore saw his mother and
[1:21:54] the disciples was standing by whom he
[1:21:55] loved he said on his motherwoman Behold
[1:21:59] thy
[1:22:00] son now Church what spoke to me about
[1:22:04] this is that the Bible says in 1 John
[1:22:07] 318-19 my little children let us not
[1:22:10] love in word neither in
[1:22:13] tongue but in deed and in
[1:22:18] truth in other words it's easy to say I
[1:22:21] love you or something like that but John
[1:22:23] says Show Your Love with your
[1:22:27] actions and hereby we know that we are
[1:22:30] of the truth and shall assure our hearts
[1:22:31] before him so that's how we can get
[1:22:33] Assurance in our lives is we actually do
[1:22:36] the works of Love instead of just
[1:22:37] talking about
[1:22:39] love right so as much as we see possible
[1:22:42] the Bible said do good to them that be
[1:22:44] of the household of faith right here
[1:22:46] amen got all these opportunities to be
[1:22:48] good to the household of faith
[1:22:50] Hallelujah we take it we try to take
[1:22:51] advantage of it by the grace of God and
[1:22:54] that's how our hearts get blessed at
[1:22:56] Assurance because we know we're loving
[1:22:57] whom God has sent to
[1:22:59] us just like that man mistreating his
[1:23:01] wife there and Malachi he ain't gonna
[1:23:04] have any blessings right God sent him
[1:23:06] that wife and he's supposed to honor
[1:23:07] that wife and love that wife and so
[1:23:09] God's going to fight against him until
[1:23:11] he repents Hallelujah he's got love in
[1:23:14] in deed and in
[1:23:16] truth
[1:23:19] hallelujah now I want to read what
[1:23:20] Albert Barn says about this uh he says
[1:23:23] woman behold th son now First Look he
[1:23:25] addresses first to his mother he says
[1:23:28] woman behold your
[1:23:31] son now no doubt he does this because
[1:23:34] Jesus knows Mary you're losing me so I'm
[1:23:38] going to give you a replacement
[1:23:40] hallelujah how many you know whenever
[1:23:41] God takes something away he adds
[1:23:43] something to you oh hallelujah praise
[1:23:45] God Amen that little boy gave his fish
[1:23:47] and his bread he got all those baskets
[1:23:49] back Hallelujah a lot of leftovers amen
[1:23:52] you give something to God God's going to
[1:23:53] give it back to you
[1:23:55] Hallelujah that's
[1:23:59] right but first he addresses her says
[1:24:02] this is your
[1:24:03] son Hallelujah so first goes to him and
[1:24:07] then he says to the disciple Behold thy
[1:24:09] mother I like what Albert Barn says he
[1:24:12] says one who is to be thee as a
[1:24:14] mother the fact that she was the mother
[1:24:17] of Jesus would secure the kindness of
[1:24:19] John and the fact that she was now
[1:24:21] entrusted to him demanded of him
[1:24:23] affectionate regard and tender
[1:24:27] care so Jesus is
[1:24:30] entrusting to the mother a son and then
[1:24:33] the son a mother Jesus is restoring this
[1:24:37] broken family ah and where is he doing
[1:24:40] it from from the cross ah what restores
[1:24:44] your broken family the cross of Jesus
[1:24:47] Amen the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:24:49] Forgiveness of Christ the mercy of
[1:24:51] Christ that's what restores every family
[1:24:55] hallelujah oh my she was losing a son
[1:24:58] I'm giving you one back amen
[1:25:01] hallelujah this is what the cross does
[1:25:03] it restores our families
[1:25:07] Hallelujah like I've told you before
[1:25:09] I've got siblings that they won't
[1:25:10] forgive my dad but to me they got to go
[1:25:13] to the Cross by God's grace they need a
[1:25:15] closer and I just say that with all the
[1:25:16] love of my heart they just need a closer
[1:25:19] walk with the
[1:25:21] Lord right because if you can't forgive
[1:25:23] somebody then God will won't forgive you
[1:25:26] and it's got to be a love it's got to be
[1:25:27] a forgiveness in word indeed on or
[1:25:29] indeed not just word that's what I'm
[1:25:30] trying to say forgive me in deed and in
[1:25:33] action and not in word only we can't say
[1:25:36] I forgive this person and then not act
[1:25:38] upon it we've got to act upon
[1:25:42] it
[1:25:44] Hallelujah sometimes I look out and I
[1:25:46] say thank the lord they're receiving it
[1:25:47] praise
[1:25:49] God God told Jeremiah don't look at
[1:25:51] their faces but I'm glad I can look at
[1:25:52] your faces that's I receiv receiving it
[1:25:54] by God's grace
[1:25:57] Hallelujah Albert Barnes went on to say
[1:25:59] from that hour Jesus I'm sorry John
[1:26:01] seems to have been in a better
[1:26:03] circumstance than the other Apostles
[1:26:06] financially that's according to John
[1:26:08] 18:16 let me read that that's what
[1:26:10] Barnes
[1:26:12] say but Peter stood at the door without
[1:26:15] then went out that other disciple which
[1:26:17] was known unto the high priest and spake
[1:26:18] unto her that kept the door and brought
[1:26:21] in Peter
[1:26:24] so I'm not sure about that
[1:26:27] one I want to read this too now Albert
[1:26:29] Bar says tradition in the church says
[1:26:31] that Mary continued to live with John in
[1:26:34] Judea until the time of her death which
[1:26:37] occurred about 15 years after the death
[1:26:39] of
[1:26:42] Christ Hallelujah is that
[1:26:45] awesome God looked at Mary she's got a
[1:26:47] window look at this window she's got a
[1:26:49] decade and a
[1:26:51] half she's don't have a husband nobody
[1:26:53] to provide for so Jesus God uses Jesus
[1:26:57] say you've lost me but I'm giving you a
[1:26:59] son and he's got the means to take care
[1:27:01] of you for the last 15 years of your
[1:27:03] life Hallelujah 15 is that interesting
[1:27:06] 15 like Hezekiah got 15 more years
[1:27:08] interesting of course Mary was in the
[1:27:09] perfect will of God we believe
[1:27:11] interesting that God gives that 15 more
[1:27:13] years
[1:27:15] there
[1:27:16] Hallelujah
[1:27:19] now John Gil said about this he
[1:27:22] said Jesus said John take care of her
[1:27:25] provide for her as if she was thine own
[1:27:27] mother this shows the tenderness of
[1:27:30] Christ who had nothing to leave her
[1:27:33] though he was Lord of all think about
[1:27:35] that he's Lord of Heaven and Earth what
[1:27:38] would he leave to the mother that that
[1:27:40] bore him not a million
[1:27:43] dollars because that's that that's not a
[1:27:45] real love he left her a son who's going
[1:27:47] to have the Holy Ghost amen what the
[1:27:50] best thing God could give you a husband
[1:27:52] or a wife or a child with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:55] amen my Hallelujah he's the Lord of
[1:27:57] Heaven the lord of the creation and he
[1:28:00] gives her a son
[1:28:02] hallelujah oh our children are so
[1:28:04] valuable to
[1:28:06] us like Haven sometimes she'll come in
[1:28:08] there and she'll say Daddy before
[1:28:09] service daddy hears a scripture I'm like
[1:28:10] I really needed that scripture thank you
[1:28:12] H God gives us now all my children are a
[1:28:14] blessing to me but that's just one
[1:28:15] example like when a case she read the
[1:28:17] church book I'm like that's my
[1:28:19] girl Malachi he'll just play a song
[1:28:22] where won't even practice that that's my
[1:28:23] son how hallelujah praise God he's
[1:28:25] willing to let himself be embarrassed to
[1:28:28] show to worship God and help his
[1:28:31] dad thank you buddy for being
[1:28:33] embarrassed for my sake appreciate
[1:28:35] that I don't plan everything out very
[1:28:37] well not much of a planner that's what
[1:28:39] my wife puts up with me
[1:28:41] too but he's the Lord of Heaven and
[1:28:43] Earth and what what would he give his
[1:28:45] mother a son who's got the Holy
[1:28:49] Ghost what's the greatest gift God could
[1:28:51] give us children with the Holy Ghost how
[1:28:54] about this friends that have the Holy
[1:28:55] Ghost a pastor a song leader a piano
[1:28:59] player amen a family of God who's Born
[1:29:02] Again Hallelujah who wants the Love In
[1:29:05] Deed and in truth not just
[1:29:10] words Mary was probably a widow Gil says
[1:29:13] by that
[1:29:15] time Christ had taken care of her and
[1:29:18] maintained her up until that point but
[1:29:20] now and here the church this what I want
[1:29:22] to close on in his dying
[1:29:24] moments think about that he's only going
[1:29:26] to utter a few more words and then he's
[1:29:29] going to die he's going to say two more
[1:29:31] things according to the the
[1:29:33] Bible in his third to the final thing he
[1:29:36] says he's talking about mothers and
[1:29:39] their
[1:29:40] children the third to the last thing he
[1:29:43] says he's concerned about
[1:29:46] family Hallelujah he's concerned about a
[1:29:49] son having a mom he's concerned about a
[1:29:52] mom having a son
[1:29:54] in the third to last thing he
[1:29:56] says and church don't forget all the
[1:29:59] beatings that he went through all he had
[1:30:01] suffered remember the Bible said his
[1:30:03] tongue stuck to the roof of his
[1:30:05] mouth you ever wake up and your mouth is
[1:30:07] really dry I get that
[1:30:10] sometimes we can't even touch what Jesus
[1:30:12] went
[1:30:14] through and then that's why he cried I
[1:30:16] thirst I
[1:30:18] thirst and he' been beaten and been they
[1:30:22] ripped out his beard
[1:30:25] and if and his bones were staring at him
[1:30:27] he was looking down in his
[1:30:28] ribs and he's bloody
[1:30:32] and I wonder how he could even see
[1:30:34] through his eyes remember his face
[1:30:35] didn't he look like a human looked like
[1:30:36] a worm the Bible said didn't look like a
[1:30:40] man and yet with all now look with all
[1:30:43] his pain with all his
[1:30:46] torment with all of his persecution he
[1:30:49] could still think about somebody other
[1:30:50] than himself God help us amen that's
[1:30:54] point I want to bring out here isn't it
[1:30:56] amazing that Jesus Christ three word or
[1:31:00] three statements before he dies he turns
[1:31:02] his attention to his mother in the flesh
[1:31:06] right well not by the flesh but just a
[1:31:08] caretaker who birthed him she wasn't by
[1:31:11] DNA his mother that's the point I'm
[1:31:12] trying to
[1:31:14] make he turns his care off of his own
[1:31:17] suffering off of the weight of the world
[1:31:20] of sin on him not only did he have all
[1:31:22] this physical he had the spirit
[1:31:23] spiritual weight of all your sins and my
[1:31:26] sins on
[1:31:28] him and the midst of this he looks at
[1:31:32] John said behold Lo see your
[1:31:36] mother behold your mother
[1:31:39] John now he'd also told him he breathed
[1:31:43] on and said well this was later he said
[1:31:45] receive the Holy Ghost amen praise God
[1:31:48] so he's got all these commands from
[1:31:49] Jesus Jesus knows he can handle it Jesus
[1:31:52] knows we can handle sermon after sermon
[1:31:54] command after command word after word
[1:31:57] because that's what we live by we live
[1:31:59] by every word that proceeds out of the
[1:32:00] mouth of God hallelujah
[1:32:06] amen eternal life is living for others
[1:32:09] he could have been complaining about a
[1:32:11] situation his bleeding his
[1:32:13] bones he could have been thinking about
[1:32:15] all that but he turns his attention to
[1:32:18] Mary and
[1:32:20] John eternal life is truly living for
[1:32:23] others
[1:32:24] in this third to last statement I love
[1:32:27] that
[1:32:30] Hallelujah woman Behold thy son Behold
[1:32:34] thy mother look John John just didn't
[1:32:37] let it go in one year out the other the
[1:32:38] Bible said he took
[1:32:40] her unto his own home and then Jesus
[1:32:44] uttered two more things I thirst and it
[1:32:47] is finished hallelujah how many glad
[1:32:49] it's finished today hallelujah it's not
[1:32:50] Easter weekend but I'll say it like this
[1:32:52] it's still finished Hallelujah
[1:32:55] the price has been paid you've been
[1:32:57] bought with the price the blood has been
[1:33:00] shed your sins are washed away you are
[1:33:03] forgiven Hallelujah you are purchased
[1:33:05] possession of God Almighty by the blood
[1:33:08] of his creative son the Virgin born son
[1:33:10] of God Jesus Christ Our Lord let's stand
[1:33:13] to our feet hallelujah amen Behold thy
[1:33:18] mother I would encourage you as
[1:33:20] musicians
[1:33:22] come I thought of this before right
[1:33:25] before it came out brother Ram tells a
[1:33:27] story he said when I was a kid he said
[1:33:29] my mom would slap me in the face because
[1:33:32] he would talk back to his mom he said
[1:33:34] she he would fall down he said when I
[1:33:37] got up she'd smack me again and this
[1:33:39] would keep repeating until he would not
[1:33:42] get up
[1:33:44] anymore this is the kind of parenting
[1:33:47] brother R was raised with he said many
[1:33:50] times I taken a meal through a straw
[1:33:54] because his mouth was so
[1:34:01] bruised
[1:34:03] right and brother Ram said and then you
[1:34:05] know brother Ram said this in another
[1:34:07] statement and I I'm not supporting abuse
[1:34:09] I would never support ofuse I've never
[1:34:10] slapped one of my children I would you
[1:34:12] should never slap your
[1:34:14] children I'm trying to show a son's love
[1:34:16] for his mother that's what I'm trying to
[1:34:21] show Hallelujah
[1:34:24] and then brother Ram said my dad would
[1:34:26] spank me and get out the uh get out his
[1:34:28] Bell or get out the the the the tree
[1:34:31] branch and brother R said I didn't get
[1:34:34] half as many whippings as I
[1:34:39] deserved brother talk about the pain so
[1:34:42] brother Ram was
[1:34:43] physically uh disciplined very harsh
[1:34:47] ways and brother R he could have held
[1:34:49] that bitterness in his heart against his
[1:34:51] mother couldn't he
[1:34:55] he could have held a bitterness against
[1:34:56] his father but brother Ram say shortly
[1:34:59] after he got saved his mom saw such a
[1:35:02] change in his life that she went to
[1:35:05] Brother brandom and she said I want to
[1:35:07] be a Christian
[1:35:08] too she repented of her sins and he said
[1:35:12] he baptized her he was one of the first
[1:35:14] baptisms after his own
[1:35:17] conversion now think about that the
[1:35:19] devil could have been there saying oh
[1:35:20] she's not sincere she never apologized
[1:35:22] for this she never apologized
[1:35:25] that but he chose to see God working
[1:35:28] through his mom now no doubt she
[1:35:29] probably did
[1:35:31] repent brother tells a story when he's
[1:35:33] by the the bedside of his mom as she
[1:35:36] passed away he said when that poor old
[1:35:39] thing couldn't even speak no more I said
[1:35:41] mother I want to commit your soul to God
[1:35:44] I did my father and I want to commit her
[1:35:46] soul to God she was lying there she
[1:35:49] could no more speak I said mother I'm
[1:35:51] standing here yet you know it if you can
[1:35:53] bat your eyes and she would bat her
[1:35:57] eyes I said I want to ask you something
[1:35:59] now mother you're just a few minutes
[1:36:01] away now from Death I said I want to
[1:36:03] stand
[1:36:04] here to see Jesus come and get your soul
[1:36:07] I said then I'll commit it to him I said
[1:36:09] I want to ask you something
[1:36:11] mother he says now I baptized my mother
[1:36:14] about 30 years ago and she was filled
[1:36:15] with the Holy Ghost she was a Christian
[1:36:17] a real saint of God how many appreciate
[1:36:19] saints of
[1:36:20] God and I said mother does Jesus mean
[1:36:24] right here when you've got maybe five
[1:36:25] more minutes to live does Jesus just as
[1:36:28] sweet to you as he was the day you
[1:36:30] received the Holy Ghost I said mother I
[1:36:33] want to say this for my own so I can
[1:36:36] tell others is he just as sweet right
[1:36:39] now you're my mother you wouldn't tell
[1:36:42] me anything wrong how many mothers can
[1:36:44] say Amen to that don't tell your
[1:36:46] children wrong dads you wouldn't tell
[1:36:47] your children anything wrong would
[1:36:51] you you're my mother you would't tell me
[1:36:53] anything wrong I want to know how you
[1:36:54] feel right now is he Jesus just as sweet
[1:36:57] as he was when you received him back
[1:36:59] Yonder 30 years
[1:37:01] ago if it is if you can't speak just bat
[1:37:05] your eyes real fast and she bat her eyes
[1:37:08] real
[1:37:10] fast I want to make sure he sees that I
[1:37:12] still love Jesus now more than anything
[1:37:14] else Hallelujah isn't that
[1:37:17] beautiful Hallelujah he said oh brother
[1:37:21] that's it yes you're not presuming then
[1:37:23] you know right where you stand that's
[1:37:24] right oh don't presume about it there's
[1:37:26] so many different ways just don't
[1:37:28] presume but God has G A Vindication of
[1:37:31] his promise see we don't have to presume
[1:37:34] about it God has Vindicated it and the
[1:37:36] church said ain't that beautiful I just
[1:37:39] thought that came that came to my heart
[1:37:40] right before service no matter what your
[1:37:42] parents have done to you no matter what
[1:37:44] anybody in your family's done to you
[1:37:45] right doesn't matter family member or
[1:37:47] not when the love of Jesus Christ comes
[1:37:50] into your heart you want to see someone
[1:37:52] have their s forgiven just as freely as
[1:37:55] your sins were
[1:37:57] given
[1:38:01] Hallelujah and this last thought was the
[1:38:03] Bible said Mary's Soul was pierced in
[1:38:05] Luke
[1:38:06] 2 I lost all my poll on this I lost all
[1:38:09] the noise on this one here but I'm still
[1:38:10] going to preach it anyway I only got one
[1:38:12] sermon today Luke 235 yay a sword shall
[1:38:15] pierce through thy own soul also that
[1:38:18] the thoughts of many hearts be revealed
[1:38:21] so Mary's there she seeing her son die
[1:38:25] and her soul is being pierced through
[1:38:27] imagine you know anyone that's ever had
[1:38:29] an awful tragic thing happen to him it's
[1:38:31] like some somebody put a sword through
[1:38:34] your
[1:38:35] soul think about the people that have
[1:38:37] lost children or the people that have
[1:38:39] lost parents and just unexpected manners
[1:38:41] and tragic accidents it's like their
[1:38:43] souls been pierced it's so hard to get
[1:38:47] over in that moment Mary is seeing the
[1:38:50] piercing of her own soul it's like a
[1:38:52] part of me
[1:38:54] but then from the cross Jesus says son
[1:38:57] behold your mother I'm restoring you a
[1:38:59] son Hallelujah God's taking me away but
[1:39:02] I'm giving you a
[1:39:03] son God was so mindful and although her
[1:39:07] soul was
[1:39:08] pierced 50 days later her soul would be
[1:39:12] filled that's what I want to say amen
[1:39:15] hallelujah praise God
[1:39:17] amen
[1:39:19] glory see no matter what happens to our
[1:39:21] soul the pains that we go through
[1:39:23] there's still a baptism of the Holy
[1:39:25] Ghost Hallelujah and brother Ram said if
[1:39:28] God wouldn't let Mary into heaven
[1:39:30] without receiving the baptism of the
[1:39:31] Holy Ghost he said what about you and I
[1:39:33] amen how many appreciate the baptism of
[1:39:35] the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah though
[1:39:37] our soul our mind has been heard and
[1:39:39] we've gone we've had scars Hallelujah
[1:39:41] despite that God said I'll fill your
[1:39:43] soul with something sweeter than life
[1:39:46] eternal life Hallelujah my thank God
[1:39:49] I'll send the spirit of my son into your
[1:39:52] hearts whereby you cry ABA father let's
[1:39:55] bow our heads how many enjoy the
[1:39:56] Mother's Day today I'm just glory amen
[1:40:00] that meant a lot to me Hallelujah though
[1:40:02] her soul was pierced through with pain
[1:40:04] God said I'll feel that Soul I'll feel
[1:40:06] it I'll heal that amen I'll hear that
[1:40:11] yes there'll always be a scar there
[1:40:12] there always be pain but I'll give you
[1:40:14] such Joy it'll be joy unspeakable and
[1:40:16] full of
[1:40:19] Glory father God in heaven we thank you
[1:40:21] for today Lord God what a wonderful day
[1:40:23] to reflect on how use mothers in the
[1:40:25] scripture Behold thy mother you
[1:40:29] said behold thy
[1:40:31] son lord it's beautiful to see even from
[1:40:34] the cross in the midst of your own pain
[1:40:36] you were still looking at
[1:40:38] others to be a high priest unto them to
[1:40:42] provide what they have need of Lord
[1:40:46] God no wonder the scripture says we have
[1:40:48] pain for night but joy comes in the
[1:40:50] morning Mary's Joy would come three days
[1:40:52] later and then the even the fullness of
[1:40:54] it would come Hallelujah 47 more days
[1:40:57] later to the 50th day Pentecost
[1:41:02] hallelujah thank
[1:41:04] God lord your Prophet said Mary danced
[1:41:06] and screamed and shouted spok in tongues
[1:41:08] like everybody else Hallelujah then she
[1:41:11] had 15 years to live in the power of the
[1:41:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:16] hallelujah thank God that we can live

[1:45:23] agnosis with cancer my mom's 38 right
[1:45:24] there my dad would have been 38
[1:45:28] to I just thought it was fitting to show
[1:45:30] that you know the enemy came in and
[1:45:33] ripped apart my family but I'm still
[1:45:35] believing God can restore all things
[1:45:37] praise God God cares about
[1:45:40] families and the faith of my mother so
