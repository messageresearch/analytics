[0:00] part
[0:03] two what a blessing to be in the house
[0:04] of the Lord thank you
[0:07] musicians Mal M I'm sorry Mali and I
[0:10] Lydia rarely ever practice so they just
[0:13] know how to wing it you know by God's
[0:15] grace special gift there son
[0:18] hallelujah hallelujah Mark chapter
[0:25] 11 I guess that's his bad on life
[0:27] brother William he's got to deal with
[0:28] the dad that don't give him much
[0:29] practice you know so if that's his worst
[0:32] battle praise the Lord
[0:33] hallelujah Mark 11:22
[0:42] hallelujah how many enjoyed uh perfect
[0:44] Faith last week by God's grace everybody
[0:45] enjoyed that that was a real blessing to
[0:49] me and we're going to look at it here a
[0:51] little little bit more further here
[0:52] tonight I I knew last week about while
[0:54] preaching I thought I'll never get to
[0:55] the end of this so I kind of knew I'd
[0:58] have a part two so let's look to the
[1:00] Lord here tonight we'll read our our
[1:01] verses here brother R mes of
[1:06] course uh so we want to just read this
[1:08] uh brother man said these always these
[1:09] scriptures always turned me around until
[1:11] the Lord showed him what it meant to
[1:13] speak to the
[1:15] mountain and it was very similar to
[1:17] speaking the squirrels brother Bram said
[1:18] God challenged me to speak those
[1:20] squirrels God did wasn't from his own
[1:23] idea wasn't from his own thoughts he was
[1:26] just out hunting he said God challenged
[1:28] me to speak those squirrels I thought is
[1:30] that scripture I was thinking today I
[1:31] said is that scriptural and Jesus said
[1:33] where is your
[1:34] faith you could have spoke to the storm
[1:37] right Jesus sometimes he'll challenge
[1:39] our faith Hallelujah we have to be
[1:41] walking with the Lord then we'll know
[1:42] exactly how to do it by God's grace
[1:44] Hallelujah that's right so Mark
[1:51] 11:22 and uh let's read we'll read 22
[1:54] and 23 together okay and then I'll read
[1:57] uh I'll read 24 25 26 because it's a
[1:59] little bit lengthy but I think I like to
[2:01] hear your voice on 23 that's the the key
[2:03] verse here in one way um so let's read
[2:07] 22 and 23 1 2 3 and Jesus answering
[2:11] saith unto them have faith in God for
[2:15] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[2:19] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[2:22] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[2:25] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[2:28] shall believe that those things which he
[2:31] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[2:34] whatsoever he saith what a promise my
[2:37] goodness what a promise of course we
[2:39] know this relies on conditions almost
[2:41] every promise of God is conditional
[2:43] Hallelujah when it applies to us us
[2:45] receiving from God but I'll read 24 25
[2:48] 26 we'll look at this a little further
[2:49] tonight brother BR says this is all
[2:51] dependent upon forgiveness Hallelujah
[2:54] said if you want to speak the word if
[2:55] you want to see God's spirit move it all
[2:57] rests on forgiveness because of these
[2:59] verses therefore I say unto you
[3:00] whatsoever things you desire When you
[3:02] pray believe that you receive them and
[3:04] you shall have them and when you stand
[3:06] praying forgive if you have ought
[3:09] against any that your father also which
[3:11] is in heaven May forgive you your
[3:13] trespasses but if ye do not forgive
[3:16] neither will your father which is in
[3:17] heaven forgive your trespasses may God
[3:20] add His blessings to read his word you
[3:21] can be seated there by God's
[3:24] grace sorry I got a little bit of runny
[3:26] nose so if you hear me got to blow my
[3:27] nose I'm very sorry it's just kind of
[3:29] running
[3:32] so forgive
[3:34] me just another Pulpit manner that I
[3:36] struggle with there by God's grace
[3:38] so so we want to look here uh tonight by
[3:42] God's grace at uh the perfect Faith
[3:45] Hallelujah and like I said I'll share on
[3:47] with a little testimony that was just
[3:49] just a sweet little way the Lord worked
[3:52] here in my life just this morning you
[3:54] know I wasn't even thinking about this
[3:55] sermon this morning you know so I just
[3:57] really feel it was led of the Lord
[3:58] thankful for God's Amazing
[4:01] Grace
[4:03] uh Lord willing next Wednesday or maybe
[4:05] Sunday we'll look at uh the breach you
[4:07] I'll be listening to the breach
[4:09] beautiful message my goodness the breach
[4:11] between um the seven Church ages and the
[4:13] Seven Seals um so i' like to maybe Lord
[4:16] willing Minister on that on Sunday we'll
[4:18] see how the Lord leads uh by God's grace
[4:20] but last week you know I did a little a
[4:22] little further teaching uh again as I've
[4:24] tried to teach our church that perfect
[4:27] faith is simply a perfect revelation
[4:30] that's all it is it's just an anointing
[4:32] where God has anointed you with the Holy
[4:34] Spirit to know God's will that's what
[4:36] perfect faith is brother Ram tells us
[4:39] and I use a lot of verses brother from
[4:40] works as Faith expressed brother Ram
[4:41] said you'll never work your way into it
[4:44] you don't work yourself up into these
[4:45] things he said if you ever got faith
[4:48] it's a gift from God to you Hallelujah
[4:51] and so uh you know that's one thing I've
[4:54] I've Just Seen around the message you
[4:55] know some some camps of churches are so
[4:58] preaching about faith and marage Ires
[5:00] they put all the they put all the
[5:01] pressure on you to believe but Jesus you
[5:05] know Jesus doesn't do it that way Jesus
[5:07] reveals it to you now he'll challenge
[5:08] you right but if he's challenged you
[5:10] then you know he wants you to speak it
[5:11] hallelujah
[5:14] hallelujah and so you know we see it's
[5:16] also sometimes misused where people will
[5:17] say uh well the L Lord says you're going
[5:20] to get healed and then they'll die now
[5:21] they didn't they didn't say thus sayith
[5:23] the Lord but they said the Lord's going
[5:24] to heal them and then they die and it's
[5:26] a great uh confusion to some I know I
[5:29] know it's a some block to numerous
[5:30] people because they've emailed me about
[5:31] it and asked me about it I know it's a
[5:33] stumbling block to some people um and so
[5:36] we got to be uh we got to be a sharper
[5:38] on the word of God brother man said even
[5:39] says in this message perfect Faith he
[5:41] said I want to try to rub out some of
[5:42] some of this unbelief right some of this
[5:45] Elementary uh understanding he said I
[5:48] want to kind of rub that off and he said
[5:49] I want to go a little deeper in the word
[5:50] of God hallelujah so that's what we
[5:52] trying to do we trying to understand
[5:54] that there sometimes God will make it
[5:56] known to us the will of God and then
[5:58] other times we may not not know for sure
[6:00] but we just feel a leading of the Lord
[6:02] that God's going to do something and if
[6:04] we're not prophets then we can't expect
[6:06] to have visions right um but there will
[6:10] be people that have visions because the
[6:11] Acts chapter 2 says that your young men
[6:13] will dream dreams your old men will see
[6:15] Visions Hallelujah does it say old men
[6:17] because that would put some of us in
[6:19] that category Hallelujah let me just
[6:21] check that by God's grace you know
[6:23] because you have a right to claim God's
[6:24] word hallelujah let me read that just uh
[6:28] just as a I just thought about that you
[6:29] can you can claim that I heard a
[6:30] preacher say that at brother Cam's
[6:32] church last week it should come to pass
[6:34] in the last days sayith God I'll pour
[6:35] out my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[6:37] sons and daughters shall prophesy
[6:39] Hallelujah so if you're a son or a
[6:42] daughter you can ask God to fulfill his
[6:44] word hallelujah how many say God
[6:46] fulfilled in my life amen me too
[6:48] Hallelujah I want Lord pour out your
[6:50] spirit on me Hallelujah I'm a son I'm a
[6:51] do I'm a son Hallelujah I got daughters
[6:53] amen and your young men shall see
[6:55] Visions all right so I I I can say that
[6:57] too Hallelujah I want to see a vision
[6:59] Lord If It Be Your Will and your old men
[7:01] shall dream dreams Hallelujah and on
[7:04] your servants and your handmaids uh hand
[7:06] I'm sorry handmaidens I will pour out in
[7:08] those days of my spirit and they shall
[7:10] prophesy amen so we basically see all of
[7:13] us have a right to say God pour out your
[7:15] spirit on me young men Visions I could
[7:18] say Lord give me a vision uh older men
[7:21] could say Lord give me dreams Hallelujah
[7:23] and if you're in between say give me
[7:25] both hallelujah how about that if you're
[7:27] in between say God do all of it amen
[7:30] pour out all your blessings on me
[7:33] Hallelujah and so we want to take
[7:34] advantage of this and we just want to
[7:36] get a better understanding and at some
[7:38] point church I do want to put a video
[7:39] out about this I believe it's a very
[7:40] important subject because brother R says
[7:42] you can never major on a
[7:44] minor you can't major on Divine Healing
[7:48] and if you don't got that then you're
[7:49] not even saved now that's the way some
[7:51] people teach it they just go a little
[7:53] too far and I understand the quotes that
[7:55] they're looking at you know brother R
[7:56] said Mark 16 is the Keystone of the
[7:58] church it's one of the five
[7:59] identifications of the church but yet we
[8:02] know we're not saved by our gifts we're
[8:04] saved by our relationship with The Giver
[8:05] of the gifts that's right right but some
[8:08] people go so heavy on that they start
[8:10] majoring on a minor Hallelujah but we
[8:12] got to find the right balance I believe
[8:13] the Holy Spirit brings that right
[8:15] balance amen amen I feel like this you
[8:17] know as I've seen it in my life I feel
[8:18] like in those moments when God wants to
[8:20] do Supernatural he'll bring me into that
[8:22] type of Faith he'll bring me into it uh
[8:25] brother M calls it desperation amen
[8:27] hallelujah amen he said we'll get
[8:29] desperate God will bring us to
[8:30] desperation and that's the time when
[8:32] we're believing we're pressing Through
[8:34] the Bible said uh we must uh press into
[8:36] the kingdom of God he said the violent
[8:38] taken by force amen and of course that's
[8:40] not violence against one another it's
[8:42] violence against Satan hallelujah it's
[8:44] fighting against the devil it's fighting
[8:45] away unbelief is fighting away uh evil
[8:48] spirits praise God that's the kind of
[8:51] Victory God wants us to have Hallelujah
[8:53] so in our lives as I said last week we
[8:56] we may not always have the ability to
[8:57] say thus sayith the Lord in fact I don't
[8:58] know if I've ever said that myself I
[9:01] just felt like I felt like the Lord said
[9:03] it but I could be wrong but what what I
[9:07] find in our lives is we simply have a
[9:08] strong urge from the Holy Spirit
[9:11] Hallelujah and then in those moments
[9:13] we'll we'll speak God's word right we'll
[9:16] just feel compelled like God has led me
[9:17] to do this God's brought me here I I
[9:19] haven't brought myself to this I feel
[9:21] like God's leading me to do this
[9:24] Hallelujah and as I said you know I went
[9:26] listen to Simon's testimonies you know
[9:28] uh did anybody go listen to Simon's
[9:30] testimony after last Wednesday night
[9:31] anybody do it okay I listened to it
[9:33] today at work when I had a little my
[9:34] little break I was listening to brother
[9:36] Simon he looks so young and know you
[9:37] know he don't have that beard and
[9:38] everything like that and like brother
[9:40] Simon look like you're 20 years
[9:43] younger I remember when we recorded that
[9:45] testimony right here like brother Mike
[9:47] MOSI but Simon see in in numerous places
[9:50] uh one of the guys he was working with
[9:52] fell two
[9:54] stories off scaffolding and landed on
[9:56] his
[9:57] shoulder and and said they're all
[9:59] standing around and he said the Holy
[10:01] Spirit came on him and he spoke healing
[10:03] he said I speak healing in the name of
[10:05] Jesus and uh they and then they called
[10:08] 911 he he was doing that death rattle
[10:10] brother Simon said he was doing the
[10:11] death rattle he he's heard somebody die
[10:13] before they do that death rattle Simon
[10:15] prayed in the name of Jesus Christ and
[10:16] he instantly just looked a little better
[10:18] they took him to the hospital he said
[10:20] the next day a guy that was 6' feet5
[10:23] come up to brother Simon and said were
[10:24] you the guy Simon kind of dramatized it
[10:26] he's like were you he was like the guy
[10:29] was looking Simon was looking up and the
[10:30] guy's looking down like were you the guy
[10:32] that prayed for this so and so Simon's
[10:34] like yeah I prayed for him you know
[10:37] Simon's bold like a lion that's why I
[10:38] love Simon Hallelujah he's gonna have
[10:40] great rewards in heaven Hallelujah I
[10:43] believe Simon's like yeah he said yeah
[10:45] by the grace of God I prayed for him he
[10:47] said I want to let you know I went to
[10:48] the hospital he said and the doctor said
[10:51] he would have died except something
[10:53] changed and he said uh something changed
[10:56] there he should have died he said
[10:58] something changed he said said and then
[11:00] later he said a few minutes later after
[11:02] he got to the hospital he was up walking
[11:03] around and the doctor said why didn't he
[11:06] die he said the doctors he said the
[11:08] doctor said it was a miracle I was there
[11:10] the six foot five
[11:11] guy and Simon's like Simon's like you go
[11:14] tell him he said Jesus Christ spared his
[11:16] life amen Simon spoke the word amen
[11:19] hallelujah
[11:21] amen and I told you Simon uh prayed for
[11:24] my nephew he was born he was one week
[11:27] old and they were going to have surgery
[11:28] CU he had a hole in his heart he had
[11:30] three other things wrong in his heart my
[11:33] little nephew and Simon said he was on
[11:35] the road to go pray for him and he got a
[11:37] call from Sister Karen
[11:39] Sanders and Karen Sanders told him a
[11:42] testimonies after testimonies for two
[11:44] hours straight and Simon said by the
[11:45] time I got there my faith was
[11:47] Skyhigh see how God does that's what I'm
[11:50] saying when God wants you to do
[11:51] something God will lead you to it
[11:53] Hallelujah he'll build up your faith for
[11:55] that time and season Hallelujah and so
[11:58] Simon said Simon said they got there but
[12:01] he said his my brother and his and his
[12:03] wife were just sad and crying and Simon
[12:06] said let's
[12:07] pray and Simon said the Holy Ghost fell
[12:10] while they were
[12:11] praying and uh Simon said I believe God
[12:13] heard our prayer I believe he's going to
[12:15] be
[12:16] well and then uh uh Simon said brother
[12:20] he said brother let me tell you some
[12:22] testimonies sister Karen told me and
[12:25] Simon said he just told oh yeah Simon
[12:27] said you know what um he said if Jesus
[12:30] was here he couldn't even heal your
[12:32] little baby and my brother's like what
[12:35] and Simon's like that's because Jesus
[12:36] already healed him
[12:38] hallelujah amen and that's when my
[12:40] brother stood up and said that boy is
[12:43] healed amen
[12:46] hallelujah and so they they took him the
[12:48] next day to the doctor they did another
[12:50] 4D scan and said we don't know what's
[12:53] happened all four conditions have gone
[12:55] he doesn't need surgery amen hallelujah
[13:01] and there was another one you know I
[13:02] can't remember the other one but those
[13:03] were the two that kind of stuck with me
[13:04] as I was you know resting there on my
[13:06] break resting from all the one million
[13:08] questions for my my students there by
[13:09] God's grace but I just thought it was a
[13:12] great example of how God leads you to
[13:14] speak the word God will lead you to have
[13:16] perfect Faith amen just like the Rapture
[13:19] how could Enoch get raptured how could
[13:20] Elijah get raptured because God gave him
[13:23] faith for that Hallelujah is it and how
[13:25] many believe God's going to give you
[13:27] faith for the Rapture amen aren't you
[13:29] following the message of your hour
[13:30] Hallelujah didn't didn't the spirit of
[13:32] Elijah come and minister to us
[13:34] hallelujah don't we get to listen to the
[13:35] spirit of Elijah on tape Hallelujah
[13:38] direct us back to the word of the word
[13:40] of God and church don't we know that our
[13:42] hearts have been turned back to the
[13:44] apostolic fathers hallelujah amen amen
[13:48] you know let's be honest you know we
[13:50] went to denominations they didn't turn
[13:51] our hearts back to the word it was the
[13:53] Holy Spirit it was this message that
[13:55] turned our hearts back to the word of
[13:57] God hallelujah amen
[13:59] we grew up in denominations we never
[14:01] heard him say thus says the Lord we come
[14:02] to the message we hear Brother Maham say
[14:04] thus sayi the Lord amen then we see it
[14:06] come to pass
[14:08] Hallelujah so how can we doubt anymore
[14:10] like that song says how can we doubt
[14:11] anymore amen we trust God hallelujah we
[14:15] trust God
[14:16] Amen and uh you know I thought I thought
[14:20] it'd be good you know I want to read
[14:21] this too you know with my wife shared
[14:23] this with me months ago darling and I'm
[14:24] sorry I didn't read it but from the
[14:25] message communion I just want to bring a
[14:27] little balance to this here not every
[14:28] time do we have to speak the
[14:30] word right you know we've had you know I
[14:33] told you this before but we used to have
[14:35] people at our church that you know when
[14:36] when we were sick or my wife was sick or
[14:37] the kids were sick or I was sick you
[14:39] know it would just be a little
[14:40] frustrating but they'd walk up and say
[14:41] just speak the word brother
[14:43] Jesse I'm like well why don't you speak
[14:45] it right and then that person will get
[14:48] sick and they never speak the word and
[14:50] then they're sick two weeks they lay in
[14:51] their bed you know uh why don't you just
[14:54] speak the word it's it's a little it's
[14:56] immature you know it's it's like a
[14:58] simple uh it's a easy fix they want
[15:00] instead of because it takes sometimes it
[15:02] takes a while to find the will of God
[15:05] and people just want an easy fix they
[15:06] just want microwave religion let's get
[15:08] it over with let's do this let's get it
[15:09] over with and but that's not how the
[15:12] spirit of God always works sometimes God
[15:14] makes you uh wrestle it out brother bam
[15:17] says brother mam calls it sweating out
[15:19] sometimes I got I got to sweat out way
[15:20] more than you he says because you have
[15:22] hundreds of people thousands of people
[15:23] coming in for prayer
[15:25] requests but I like this quote my wife
[15:27] shared with me
[15:29] um brother brother B says in 1962
[15:32] communion there was a certain Minister
[15:34] today I heard him he on a he was on a
[15:36] radio broadcast broadcast
[15:39] sorry and when he come to our country he
[15:41] had a great sinus trouble and they were
[15:43] talking about an operation and they said
[15:45] they was going to do this and that and
[15:46] cut him on and operate you remember that
[15:48] one
[15:49] honey and take part of the sinus glands
[15:52] out which would sink his face in so this
[15:55] is what he's saying the doctors are
[15:56] saying we're going to we're going to we
[15:57] have surgery and then your face is going
[15:59] to sink
[16:00] in and he said he taken pills by the
[16:04] barrel anybody ever taken pills by the
[16:06] barrel thank God I haven't he said look
[16:09] like there were so many pills he had to
[16:11] take but when he come to a good
[16:13] Christian doctor this the story about's
[16:15] telling now this is the same man that
[16:17] said speak the word this is the same man
[16:19] that spoke squirrels into existence
[16:22] Hallelujah he said so he brother man
[16:25] said the man went to a bad doctor then
[16:26] he went to a Christian doctor and the
[16:29] Christian doctor said let's forget the
[16:31] pills and let's forget the operation and
[16:34] let's build up the body so it can resist
[16:37] the sinuses brother Ram said that's it
[16:41] and the church said right how many times
[16:44] on how many times on tape have I heard
[16:46] brother Ram say just pray for me I'm a
[16:47] little sore tonight and I've got a real
[16:49] B bad cold but just pray for me why
[16:52] didn't brother Ram just say I'm a
[16:53] prophet I'm speaking the
[16:55] word in fact I I fact I heard I read him
[16:57] today brother man said Satan keeps
[16:59] trying to give me this coal but I keep
[17:00] giving it back well he keeps giving it
[17:02] to me he said but God will give me the
[17:04] victory why didn't he just speak the
[17:06] word one time it's all done because he's
[17:10] human because God gives you Grace God's
[17:13] grace is sufficient in every
[17:15] trial and God is not your Aaron boy or
[17:18] my Aaron boy God does what he wants
[17:21] Hallelujah that's the balance you don't
[17:23] hear you don't hear that quote so honey
[17:24] thank you right we can all say thank you
[17:26] sister Christen Hallelujah
[17:29] oh you don't have to say that but sure I
[17:32] appreciate that darling that's just a
[17:33] good balance out quote it just balances
[17:36] it out there was one time in 65 brother
[17:39] said I just come back from the mountains
[17:40] I was up there hunting and I was saying
[17:42] with some friends he said and they
[17:44] overfed me and I'm sick and I got a
[17:45] stomach ache here tonight but I still
[17:47] got to preach anyway why didn't he just
[17:48] speak the word to his stomach condition
[17:51] because you got to wait on God for it
[17:54] there's any lesson we learn we must
[17:56] learn to wait on the Lord hallelujah
[17:59] like like I told you that story you know
[18:00] like in the CS Lewis he said uh I don't
[18:03] keep God in my pocket and I can just
[18:04] bring God out whenever I want to use it
[18:05] you know that's not God doesn't fit in
[18:07] my pocket he's the creator of the
[18:09] universe Hallelujah I got to fit in his
[18:12] pocket hallelujah amen that's right I
[18:15] want to fit in his plans praise God I
[18:17] don't want to fit God into my plans I
[18:19] want God I want to be a part of God's
[18:21] plans
[18:22] Hallelujah can't just bring them out
[18:23] whenever I want well I'll speak in
[18:24] tongues now well I I'll prophesy now
[18:27] I'll only do it when God leads me to do
[18:29] it Hallelujah do I want to walk in faith
[18:32] yes do I want to walk in the Holy Spirit
[18:35] absolutely but I'm not the one in
[18:37] control of him he's in control of
[18:40] me so there you go Saints Hallelujah not
[18:43] every problem is speak in the mountain
[18:44] sometimes you just need a good Christian
[18:46] doctor and you got to build up your body
[18:48] with some healthy food and exercise and
[18:50] the church
[18:51] said and then resist that sinus that
[18:55] sinus trouble Hallelujah now I want to
[18:59] just real quick let's go over those
[19:00] examples again a brother Ram talking
[19:02] about perfect Faith uh remember this
[19:04] from last Wednesday I kind of ended with
[19:06] it I was I was real shocked at what time
[19:08] I I was looking at and I went really
[19:10] late last week so I made a little
[19:12] promise to myself I'm not going to
[19:14] preach that long tonight I'm GNA try to
[19:16] keep my
[19:17] promise yeah
[19:20] Amen brother M said the woman that
[19:22] touched him she said if I can only touch
[19:26] the board of His Garment I'll be made
[19:28] well
[19:29] he said she actually believed it she
[19:31] felt within herself the blood issue
[19:34] stuffed and Jesus had turned around and
[19:36] said who touch me that perfect Faith the
[19:39] same perfect Faith tonight will touch
[19:41] Jesus just as it did then hallelujah
[19:44] amen but look it look church it was
[19:46] already in her everybody see that she
[19:48] already had the perfect
[19:50] Faith she knew if I could just touch him
[19:53] I'll be made well Hallelujah so see she
[19:56] had the Revelation first that's right
[19:59] she had perfect Faith first she'd have
[20:00] to work her way into it God gave it to
[20:02] her amen after what 12 or 18 years of of
[20:06] bleeding for some reason after 12 or 18
[20:09] years whichever I think the story I
[20:10] think there's two different women like
[20:12] that why is it after 12 years why is it
[20:15] after 18 years because that's God's plan
[20:17] Hallelujah because God doesn't want to
[20:19] do it when you want to do it God does it
[20:21] when he wants to do it Hallelujah we got
[20:23] to be faithful and wait till he drops
[20:25] that Revelation in our heart Hallelujah
[20:28] that's the first one brother uses who's
[20:30] got perfect Faith the woman who touched
[20:31] a
[20:33] garment the next one he said Joshua
[20:35] spoke to the son that was perfect Faith
[20:38] well just like it's just like just like
[20:40] uh Moses how could Moses control nature
[20:43] how could he call flies and fleas and
[20:46] and and darkness over the land and kill
[20:48] the firstborn and you know by the angel
[20:50] of the Lord how can you do that because
[20:51] God told him
[20:53] first brother R said remember did was it
[20:55] what brother say about Moses he was
[20:57] living so close to God Pharaoh didn't
[20:59] know what to do with him
[21:01] hallelujah hallelujah that's why he
[21:03] could speak the word of God that's why
[21:05] he had perfect Faith because God always
[21:06] told him what to do and that's what
[21:08] Jesus said Jesus said I do nothing
[21:10] except the father shows me first
[21:12] Hallelujah that's why he walked in
[21:14] perfect faith and that's how we can walk
[21:16] in perfect faith when God shows us what
[21:19] to do when God leads us to do something
[21:22] Hallelujah now we'd like him a little
[21:24] bit more closer in between right how
[21:26] many could say raise your hand and say
[21:27] Lord I like I like those Miracles and I
[21:29] like the times you speak the word
[21:30] through me I like it be more often
[21:33] that's that was brother R's prayer in
[21:34] that sermon he said we see Apostolic
[21:37] times he said but we want to see more of
[21:38] it oh hallelujah amen that's the
[21:43] believer's desire Lord let me be so and
[21:45] to with the holy spirit so you can speak
[21:47] through me
[21:48] Hallelujah you know someone just put a
[21:50] comment on my my Sunday sermon about
[21:52] Behold thy mother and they said wow they
[21:54] said uh you're truly called to preach I
[21:56] said well I'm glad somebody knows that
[21:57] Hallelujah
[21:59] sometimes I doubt brother
[22:01] William battle battle Satan you know I
[22:03] got to fight him off but she said you
[22:06] know from this time stamp to that that
[22:08] these 10 minutes in there I felt like
[22:10] you were preaching to me it was right to
[22:11] my situation and right for the internet
[22:14] the internet need to hear that so I'll
[22:16] tell you whoever God wants to use may
[22:18] God use it Hallelujah whoever whoever
[22:20] wants to hear from God they can hear
[22:22] from him remember our gifts and our poll
[22:24] operates the preaching
[22:26] hallelujah amen of course Joshua would
[22:29] have been told by God or would have felt
[22:31] the unction of God to speak to the speak
[22:34] to the son stand still then he said all
[22:37] Jesus's Miracles you know as I quoted
[22:39] that scripture I can do nothing except
[22:40] the father shows me forth brother Raam
[22:42] said Elijah could have perfect Faith
[22:43] because God showed him what was going to
[22:45] happen to those Hebrew I'm sorry those
[22:47] uh Baal prophets and he said that he
[22:49] said Lord let Israel and let all these
[22:51] people see that I've done it according
[22:53] to Thy word that's right everybody see
[22:55] that yeah brother said that's why he
[22:57] could Mock and make fun of them he
[22:59] wouldn't have done it unless he would
[23:00] have known what's going to happen right
[23:03] because you don't see him doing that
[23:04] after Jezebel threatens him you don't
[23:05] see him mocking Jezebel he tuck taals
[23:07] and runs from Jezebel the Holy Ghost
[23:09] left him the spirit of God left his mind
[23:13] he became a depressed Prophet a suicidal
[23:16] Prophet right we've heard brother the
[23:18] brothers preach that it's good message
[23:20] brother brah said that see but God's got
[23:24] to drop it in our hearts first
[23:26] Hallelujah so these are great examples
[23:29] we want to remember that by God's grace
[23:31] so you know I I I I don't want to put
[23:33] perfect Faith way out there like we can
[23:35] never uh we could never uh attain to it
[23:38] because we can now for us it might look
[23:40] different right so for brother Bram he
[23:43] had you know of course Visions right
[23:44] brother BR had visions and he know you
[23:45] know that person has to be standing
[23:46] there or this thing's got to be on the
[23:48] table there before God can move in the
[23:50] vision right before God can bring it to
[23:52] reality now you and I let's be honest
[23:55] how many times do that happen to us very
[23:57] very very rare right very R it's usually
[24:00] just in a brother brah calls it a spur
[24:02] of a moment usually it's in that moment
[24:04] you know you'll just say oh it's going
[24:05] to be all right or I believe God heard
[24:07] our prayers or you're you're well by the
[24:09] grace of God you know God's going to
[24:11] heal you it's just something simple like
[24:13] that so for us it's going to be a little
[24:15] different but we got to be under the
[24:17] anointing I'll say like this we want to
[24:18] be under expectation
[24:20] Hallelujah God uses God use me I want to
[24:24] come to church and I want to or I want
[24:25] to have my phone when I get a text from
[24:27] somebody for prayer I want to be ready
[24:28] to pray I want to be in a condition
[24:30] where I can speak the word of God
[24:36] hallelujah now the next example now this
[24:38] is new I didn't mention this but brother
[24:40] Ram says the next situation he says we
[24:42] see the disciples at first didn't have
[24:45] perfect
[24:46] Faith because they couldn't cast a demon
[24:49] off the sick
[24:50] child and they go to Jesus and they said
[24:52] why can't we do it he said because you
[24:54] didn't pray and fast this EP this epilc
[24:58] see demon doesn't come out except by
[25:00] prayer and fasting now we get a deeper
[25:03] thought now right now if we want to have
[25:05] perfect Faith now if we want to have
[25:07] Revelation now we got to live
[25:08] consecrated that's that desperation
[25:10] brother B talked to us about right so
[25:13] there's some Miracles God Will Lead You
[25:15] In A desperate State I got to have this
[25:17] now we got to see it now it's very
[25:20] important Hallelujah and that's where a
[25:23] deeper consecration comes in everybody
[25:26] understand that by God's grace
[25:29] so brother said they didn't have a
[25:30] revelation with this epilepsy demon so
[25:33] that's what we got to ask ourselves Lord
[25:35] is there a revelation I missing and if
[25:36] so I know you love me you'll lead me
[25:39] into this hallelujah amen you're not
[25:41] against me you're for me hallelujah
[25:43] amen you're not fighting against me
[25:46] you're fighting for me Hallelujah and
[25:48] you'll lead me into this when it's your
[25:50] time to do it praise God I've always
[25:53] wondered you know why God didn't uh use
[25:55] me more to speak to the mountains right
[25:57] in our church you know it seems like
[25:58] it's always outside the church well a
[25:59] couple times it has you know with with
[26:01] Zur and who his dad and things like that
[26:04] but I just always wondered but you know
[26:06] what I just got to keep myself
[26:08] consecrated to God I want to be more
[26:10] consecrated praise
[26:12] God you know it's been a couple people
[26:14] at work and different times where I've
[26:16] spoken uh to mountains and so forth and
[26:19] it was just such a refresh brother
[26:20] William I don't know if you ever heard
[26:21] this but this blessed me so much last
[26:23] week Jesus said speak to the mountain
[26:25] it'll move it'll be tossed in the sea
[26:27] but I I forgot and I must have never
[26:29] connected it in Zechariah 4 the holy
[26:32] spirit said tell zerubabel speak to the
[26:35] mountain amen and what was the mountain
[26:38] the mountain was the political
[26:40] persecution where they couldn't rebuild
[26:42] the Temple they started the temple but
[26:44] they didn't finish it but it was such a
[26:46] simple
[26:47] Revelation the mountains don't have to
[26:49] be some major major like impossible
[26:52] things it can be something simple some
[26:55] obstacle in your life something that's
[26:57] keeping you from moving on with God
[26:59] hallelujah and in their case remember
[27:01] God rebuked them God said you're
[27:03] spending so much time on your house
[27:04] building your houses and you neglect the
[27:06] house of God
[27:08] hallelujah really that's what that's
[27:10] what the scripture says in Hagi they
[27:12] made their houses so beautiful and fancy
[27:15] they neglected the house of
[27:17] God and then it's interesting too then
[27:19] they had to go up to the mountains and
[27:20] get the Cedars to finish the they had to
[27:22] go up to the mountain to move the
[27:24] spiritual Mountain that's just a nice
[27:26] play on words there Hallelujah
[27:29] so there was connections to
[27:32] mountains so now church you can see we
[27:35] can see clearly if we want to be used by
[27:38] God to speak the word there's times
[27:40] we're going to have to fast and pray
[27:42] devote to more prayer
[27:45] Hallelujah now I want I want you to hear
[27:47] what brother Ram says when you've got
[27:49] perfect Faith he says this is what you
[27:51] would want to
[27:52] do bear with me with a heart full of joy
[27:56] you could walk into a city room if you
[27:58] got if you got perfect Faith walk into a
[28:00] sick
[28:01] room knowing exactly what you're going
[28:03] to
[28:06] say walk in there and know what's going
[28:08] to happen something's already been
[28:11] revealed and you know
[28:14] it and you walk in and say in the name
[28:17] of Jesus Christ rise up from there thus
[28:19] sayith the Lord there you are he said
[28:21] that's perfect Faith now look what he
[28:22] says next if there be 10 million people
[28:25] there saying it wouldn't happen you know
[28:28] it's going to happen
[28:31] anyhow this is this is what brother
[28:33] calls perfect Faith you got a revelation
[28:37] of what God wants to did unto me that's
[28:39] mature Faith right there this is someone
[28:42] that 10 million people couldn't convince
[28:44] you that's a lot of doubt that's a lot
[28:48] of questions 10 million people could ask
[28:50] but brother says when you got perfect
[28:51] Faith nobody can convince you otherwise
[28:54] Hallelujah I just want you to see this
[28:56] is the type of mature faith we're
[28:58] talking
[29:01] about
[29:03] Hallelujah now church just you know when
[29:05] when I when I prayed for Hau and xur's
[29:07] Dad and God gave what was it three extra
[29:09] years God gave him almost three right
[29:11] almost three I told you that
[29:15] story
[29:18] um I I I in that moment I didn't know
[29:21] what to say I remember remember I told
[29:22] you story I woke up around 4:00 4:30 I
[29:23] usually don't wake up that
[29:25] early and three scriptures are on my
[29:27] mind I can never remember the last two
[29:28] all I can remember is Proverbs where it
[29:30] says there's life and death in the power
[29:32] of the tongue and I was like that's
[29:34] really strange why am I waking up
[29:36] thinking about there's life and death
[29:37] power on the tongue around 8 or 9:00 a.m
[29:39] brother amen calls me and says who dad
[29:41] has had a heart attack and they his
[29:44] unconscious and all these things I said
[29:46] brother let's go pray let's go speak the
[29:49] word of God I still remember that
[29:50] morning I'm looking out my my back on on
[29:51] the deck and I see the sun rising and
[29:54] I'm holding my cell phone there and I
[29:55] say in the name of Jesus Christ I speak
[29:57] to that mountain of heart disease and
[29:59] he's going to come at that hospital and
[30:01] he's going to be well in the name of
[30:02] Jesus Christ I speak to that
[30:04] mountain because and I said because
[30:06] there's life and death in the power of
[30:08] the tongue amen
[30:10] hallelujah now did I have some doubts
[30:12] sure we had to wait quite a few three or
[30:13] four weeks to really see God move but in
[30:17] that moment he prepared he gave me the
[30:19] verse ahead of
[30:20] time right and look and God reminded me
[30:23] I was already working I was it was
[30:24] during the co days when we everybody
[30:27] remember the co days
[30:28] how could I forget brother
[30:30] Jesse well you might forget but I was
[30:33] already working on my computer I was
[30:34] getting my video Lesson ready I was
[30:36] going to teach on the internet not in
[30:38] person I was going to teach over over
[30:40] the computer I was getting and and so my
[30:43] mind wasn't even on the scripture see
[30:45] the Holy Spirit brought it to my
[30:47] remembrance hallelujah amen isn't that
[30:50] what Jesus said Jesus said the Holy
[30:51] Ghost will bring all things to your
[30:53] remembrance
[30:55] Hallelujah but I wasn't absolutely sure
[30:58] like like I don't think I would have
[30:59] told 10 million people Z that your dad
[31:01] was going to come out I don't think I
[31:02] would have maybe told 10 million people
[31:03] but I thought we spoke God's word you
[31:06] know we we believe God's word I I could
[31:08] said there there's two witnesses you
[31:10] know I I woke up early and I got the
[31:13] word of God and then the need came
[31:14] there's like three Witnesses this seems
[31:15] like it's lining up why would God wake
[31:18] me up early why would the scripture be
[31:19] on my mind like that and why would amen
[31:21] call me at 8: a. it just seemed like it
[31:22] worked out but I had to battle the next
[31:25] three weeks you better believe I was
[31:26] battling
[31:28] remember the first few Sundays I'm like
[31:29] sister who how's your dad oh he's still
[31:31] in the hospital he's still
[31:33] unconscious let's speak let's keep
[31:35] speaking the word you know right just
[31:37] had that moment where you got to keep
[31:38] battling praise
[31:40] God but this is the perfect Faith or
[31:44] perfect Revelation brother's talking
[31:46] about now church for us to have that
[31:48] what we need is more consecration amen
[31:51] and M church it's got to be the plan of
[31:53] God too if God don't want you to speak
[31:55] the word in certain ways well then
[31:56] you're never going to do it right and we
[31:58] never want to pretend like we are right
[32:01] brother man said never just he said wait
[32:02] he said the skies are full of real
[32:04] things amen the skies full of
[32:06] Pentecostal blessings amen don't settle
[32:08] for something
[32:10] false
[32:14] Hallelujah now brother BR breaks into
[32:16] this he said job and Peter both had
[32:19] condemnations in their heart so they
[32:21] couldn't have perfect
[32:24] Faith he said in the Book of Job it says
[32:26] job feared remember the I preached on
[32:28] that numerous times about job job said
[32:30] all that I feared had come upon him so
[32:33] job was doing great things for God but
[32:35] he had a SE a problem with fear maybe a
[32:37] secret problem but he he says it later
[32:40] all that I feared has come upon me I've
[32:41] greatly fear these
[32:44] things right he said what he feared
[32:47] actually happened what brought it his
[32:49] fear that's what made it happen his
[32:51] faith would have kept it from him but
[32:52] his fear brought it to him he was scared
[32:55] it was going to happen and it did happen
[32:57] see what what I mean he says he said if
[32:59] you're afraid to come in the prayer line
[33:01] maybe I just haven't got faith
[33:02] sufficient he said it'll never happen
[33:04] don't worry but if you know it's going
[33:06] to happen it'll
[33:08] happen now Church most of us don't come
[33:10] in the prayer line absolutely positive
[33:12] it's going to happen we have to battle
[33:15] some level of fear and uncertainty and
[33:17] doubt right
[33:19] right but that doesn't mean God hasn't
[33:21] dropped the Revelation in our hearts
[33:24] right it's like jerus said you know Lord
[33:26] I believe help my unbelief yeah right
[33:28] there's a part of me I got a revelation
[33:30] I believe but you know I just I just
[33:32] want to put my faith with the preachers
[33:33] I want to put my faith with the sisters
[33:35] or the brothers you know I just want to
[33:37] put it with somebody else I mean that's
[33:39] what every time I come up for prayer
[33:40] that's what I'm coming up for prayer
[33:42] Lord Brother Simon y I want to put my
[33:43] faith with yours I know the Holy Spirit

[33:58] he said Peter was doing all right
[34:00] walking on the water until he got scared

[34:05] so look he had thus sayi the Lord he
[34:07] already knew the will of God Amen he had
[34:10] perfect Faith but look what happens when
[34:13] you start doubting perfect Faith see he
[34:16] said he was scared first he thought it
[34:18] was a ghost He said Lord if it be you
[34:19] bid me to come on the water brother said
[34:22] he was doing all right until he started
[34:25] doubting Hallelujah so that that's
[34:27] something we've got to battle as well if
[34:30] we know God's leading us to something
[34:32] and yet we start doubting it then we got
[34:33] to we just got to trust that God will
[34:35] lead us to believe it and to strengthen
[34:38] our faith so we won't miss it in Jesus
[34:40] name right that's one fear you know that
[34:43] that's one uh battle we always have uh
[34:46] am I doing something wrong did I miss
[34:47] the will of God did I miss a healing for
[34:49] somebody did right we we like when
[34:51] brother Dennis preached that Ain sermon
[34:53] right none of us want to be
[34:55] aens right so what does it do it makes
[34:57] us search our Souls like God I don't
[34:59] want to keep somebody in our church from
[35:01] getting a a
[35:02] miracle and thank God for those good
[35:04] checkup times amen but remember God's
[35:07] for us he's not against us
[35:09] hallelujah and that's the beauty of just
[35:12] having a time of prayer wherever your
[35:13] prayer time is and confess everything
[35:16] and say God wash me in your blood wash
[35:18] me white as snow help me to have the

[35:36] a fervent desire I want to please God
[35:39] today and you're willing to reach out in
[35:41] the spirit I I feel the spirit of God
[35:42] leading
[35:44] me amen so what's God leading you
[35:47] tonight
[35:48] Hallelujah that's the question that's
[35:49] what it comes down to right what is God
[35:52] leading me to believe
[35:55] tonight all right now now here's a major
[35:58] quote brother Williams probably heard it
[35:59] aund times maybe
[36:01] 150 brother said now perfect faith is a
[36:04] master of all
[36:07] circumstances right perfect Faith
[36:10] Masters all circumstances no matter what
[36:12] it is it Masters it now watch when you
[36:14] believe anything do anything you got to
[36:16] have faith in what you're doing no
[36:17] matter what the circumstances is it
[36:19] Masters that circumstance in a room of
[36:22] sickness the Lord's revealed that
[36:24] certain things going to happen you just
[36:25] speak it and go on now I've always
[36:28] pointed this out when I preach this
[36:29] maybe a few times you and I are not the
[36:32] master of all circumstances faith is the
[36:34] master of all
[36:36] circumstances right because we can all
[36:38] see maybe even times this week we failed
[36:41] circumstances we got to remember to keep
[36:43] this quote the right
[36:44] way now if you if you receive a
[36:46] revelation from God then yes you will
[36:48] master that circumstance but you're not
[36:50] going to master every circumstance
[36:52] because you're not Jesus you're not the
[36:54] word you're a part of the word but
[36:55] you're not all the word amen
[36:58] everybody got it by God's grace let's
[37:00] apply that quote the right way if I've
[37:03] got perfect Faith I'll master that
[37:05] circumstance God's called me to I'll
[37:08] cross that Jordan or I'll cross that red
[37:10] sea or those walls will fall down in
[37:12] Jericho if God gives me the faith for it
[37:15] Hallelujah and I can pray until those
[37:17] walls do come down
[37:21] amen I told you I wasn't going to be
[37:23] long tonight so we'll see keep looking
[37:25] at that busy body back there
[37:29] so again we got to understand these
[37:32] quotes by other quotes in
[37:33] scriptures in other words you can't work
[37:36] yourself up into perfect Faith God's got
[37:38] to reveal it to you amen God's got to
[37:41] reveal it to you that's what Simeon had
[37:44] remember the Bible said I read it this
[37:45] week the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[37:47] revealed to Simeon that he would not die
[37:50] until he saw the Lord's
[37:52] Christ well he didn't have any Bible for
[37:54] that that was a personal revelation but
[37:57] he had after that after that Revelation
[37:59] came he had perfect
[38:01] faith in other words I will not die
[38:04] until I see the Messiah
[38:06] Hallelujah and then he then God worked
[38:09] it out where Jesus was born and Jesus is
[38:11] brought brought right to the temple he
[38:13] sees Jesus he said now I can go to
[38:14] heaven my eyes have seen the salvation
[38:17] of the Lord hallelujah I always knew
[38:19] this would happen praise
[38:21] God church that's what we need we just
[38:23] need a simple Revelation and I told you
[38:25] this before but I at some point in my
[38:27] life if God terries I want to seek God
[38:29] and ask God God am I going to live to
[38:31] see the Rapture or not I'd like to know
[38:33] that I just personally would like to
[38:35] know that that's something I like to
[38:37] seek God about I mean what what what
[38:39] would you like to seek God out
[38:41] about I just love how Daniel did it for
[38:43] 21 days brother William 21 days three
[38:46] weeks he just ate wa drank water and ate
[38:48] little Foods you know and he just shut
[38:50] himself away also so he could understand
[38:53] when is Israel going to get back to the
[38:55] land that's all so if we ever
[38:58] consecrated God it'd be the same thing
[39:00] Lord when is this Gentile bride going to
[39:02] be
[39:02] finished Hallelujah when is the rure
[39:05] going to be in my
[39:07] lifetime my children's
[39:09] lifetime think about that that's that
[39:12] was just a simple request when are we
[39:14] going to see some of this restoration
[39:16] happen
[39:17] amen
[39:18] hallelujah I got to remember I got all
[39:20] summer I could do some of these things
[39:22] but I got to remember to do it
[39:23] Hallelujah I got to be I gotta be led by
[39:24] the Holy Spirit to do it
[39:27] got to be led by the holy spirit so
[39:29] faith is the master of every
[39:32] circumstance no matter what circumstance
[39:34] is if God gives you that anointing
[39:35] you're going to pass the
[39:37] test
[39:40] Hallelujah now Church let's rub out a
[39:43] little bit this unbelief here I've I've
[39:45] shared this before but maybe not too
[39:48] often some people misuse the quote where
[39:50] it says any positive attitude toward any
[39:52] promise of God will bring it to pass
[39:55] that's true if You' got the revelation
[39:56] of it
[39:58] but if you don't have the revelation of
[39:59] it you can be positive all you want it
[40:01] ain't going to
[40:02] happen that's what brother R says in the
[40:04] works of Faith Express in so many in so
[40:06] many different words he says they can
[40:08] pour a g 50 gallons of oil on you but
[40:10] until you got the Revelation you're
[40:11] still going to be sick he tells us that
[40:14] in in different
[40:16] words right so what I'm saying is don't
[40:18] let the devil beat you up you don't have
[40:19] a positive enough attitude well first I
[40:22] before I can have the attitude I want to
[40:23] have the right Revelation praise God I
[40:26] want to know the word of God because
[40:28] remember in 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[40:31] Paul asked Jesus to heal him three
[40:34] times right but people today will look
[40:36] you know immature message Believers will
[40:38] look at him today and say just speak the
[40:39] word brother Paul just speak the word
[40:40] you get your eyesight back just speak it
[40:43] why don't you speak it I'm gonna start
[40:45] doing that
[40:46] more people tell me that well why don't
[40:48] you speak the word of God you got the
[40:50] Holy Ghost on you right you're the one
[40:52] who brought it
[40:55] up but three times
[41:00] and so we it's just a great it's a great
[41:02] lesson to always find the will of God
[41:05] it's not just based upon our confession
[41:07] it's based upon the Revelation and then
[41:09] we must confess God's revelation
[41:12] Hallelujah that's it he's the high
[41:14] priest of our profession but we got to
[41:16] know his Revelation first before we can
[41:18] profess it
[41:19] hallelujah amen it's always based upon
[41:22] the will of God like Abraham then
[41:25] brother uses Abraham in the story well
[41:27] of course he could call those things as
[41:28] not as though they were because God told
[41:31] him for 25 years brother will for 25
[41:35] years God told him your children are
[41:36] going to be the number of the stars and
[41:38] the sand verse 25 well no wonder he
[41:41] could call those things not though they
[41:43] are right because he had a thus say the
[41:45] Lord he had a
[41:48] revelation
[41:50] right so we've got to take that same
[41:53] pattern God reveals it then you can
[41:54] confess it we got to take that same
[41:56] pattern and apply to our lives what has
[41:58] God revealed to me what's God revealed
[42:00] to you and then what God's revealed to
[42:03] you keep the confession Hallelujah call
[42:06] those things not as though they were
[42:08] Hallelujah now brother says you can just
[42:10] hope he said just be he said you can be
[42:12] positive he said that will encourage you
[42:14] he said just speak you know speak
[42:16] positive don't speak negative right
[42:17] don't bring an evil spirit on you be
[42:19] positive like I'm trusting in the Lord I
[42:21] don't know but I'm trusting in God be
[42:23] positive don't be negative but the only
[42:26] way to be absolutely sure is to have the
[42:28] Revelation the perfect Faith hallelujah
[42:30] oh my amen I love this amen rubbing out
[42:34] some of this immaturity and unel just
[42:35] rub that out
[42:39] Hallelujah Glory now I'm coming down
[42:42] here I'm almost
[42:43] done you can believe
[42:46] that at this moment towards this and at
[42:49] the end of the sermon brother R starts
[42:50] just Discerning people in the in the
[42:51] crowd he just breaks into the
[42:53] sermon he said Jim do you know do you
[42:56] believe that God knows about that baby
[42:58] it took fever before you left 105 bam
[43:01] doesn't know this he just discerns it do
[43:04] you believe it he'll heal it come on
[43:08] come on it today sick it'll leave I just
[43:10] looked over there and seen them over
[43:11] there before they left home what they
[43:12] done now that's true how about that
[43:15] before you leave home you got a sick
[43:16] baby with a fever prophet of God calls
[43:18] it out you think that would raise your
[43:19] faith sure discerns your
[43:23] heart he says Mrs little do you believe
[43:25] God will give you victory over that
[43:26] diabetes
[43:28] then there's a woman sitting beside you
[43:30] don't know you but the spirit's on her
[43:31] she's worried about she got a child that
[43:33] has an operation for an eye she's from
[43:35] Chicago well and then brother R breaks
[43:37] in that verse it's quicker more powerful
[43:40] than a two-edged sword a discerner what
[43:42] is that the word do you believe that
[43:44] certainly amen I love that he preaches
[43:47] perfect Faith about read Revelation and
[43:49] then God starts giving him Revelation to
[43:51] tell the people amen hallelujah so they
[43:53] can have perfect faith
[43:57] Mrs peena you've heard that one it isn't
[44:00] for you it's for this grandson sitting
[44:01] here you're praying about it you believe
[44:02] that God will make it well you believe
[44:04] God can tell me what's wrong with him
[44:05] doctors don't know that's right it's
[44:07] swelling lungs that's right he's got a
[44:09] blood condition correct they're they're
[44:11] kind of confused whether they're going
[44:12] to let him go to school or not he said
[44:15] it's quicker more powerful than a
[44:16] two-edged
[44:18] sword he starts Discerning all these
[44:22] people remember church I read it last
[44:24] week brother R said this sermon was to
[44:27] raise the faith of the people and then
[44:30] he says now there's no prayer cards in
[44:32] the building we don't use them here
[44:34] unless we just have to keep it in order
[44:37] you want to be prayed for how many wants
[44:38] to be prayed for while the word is
[44:39] manifesting through flesh
[44:42] Hallelujah and then brother R tells him
[44:44] he said don't you come in this prayer
[44:46] line unless you've got perfect Faith now
[44:47] think about that what if I said that
[44:49] brother William
[44:51] today it make you think before you come
[44:53] up for prayer right next time whether
[44:55] Keith's preaching or who brother Brook
[44:57] or whoever is preaching if they said
[44:58] don't come in this prayer line because
[45:00] brother Ram said you'll be wasting
[45:01] people's time that's what brother Ram
[45:02] says that's quite a
[45:05] statement and remember there's no
[45:07] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[45:08] Jesus right but I'm just bringing it
[45:10] down this sermon was about perfect Faith
[45:13] this was about revelation of the word of
[45:15] God having a revelation of what God
[45:17] wanted to
[45:18] do brother said we don't have prayer
[45:20] cards he said so he said just get get in
[45:24] the
[45:24] line and then how many know brother Ram
[45:27] prays nine minutes straight and I I wish
[45:30] I would have had time to put up there
[45:31] brother Ram says the same almost the
[45:33] same exact prayer word for word for
[45:35] every person that goes through the
[45:36] prayer line there's probably 100 people
[45:38] that go through the prayer line let me
[45:40] read the first for you he
[45:41] says let those who have faith come
[45:44] forward in the name of Jesus Christ I
[45:45] lay my hands on her for healing in the
[45:47] name of Jesus Christ I condemn the
[45:49] sickness in the name of Jesus Christ I
[45:50] lay hands on my brother for healing he
[45:52] don't discern him or nothing he just
[45:53] that's all he says he said but you've
[45:56] already got perfect faith that when I
[45:58] pray for you God's going to heal you
[45:59] praise God so we're just going through
[46:02] the acts because you've already got
[46:03] perfect Faith you already know God's
[46:06] going to do it so that's all I got to do
[46:08] I don't have to discern you I just got
[46:10] to speak the name of Jesus Amen it's a
[46:13] beautiful sermon if you haven't listened
[46:14] to it listen to it please in Jesus
[46:18] Christ's name I lay hands on my sister
[46:19] for healing in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:21] I lay hands on my brother for his
[46:22] healing in Jesus name I lay hands on my
[46:24] sister for healing in Jesus name I lay
[46:26] hands on my sister
[46:29] then he prays for brother da and brother
[46:30] DA's wife he said is that all of
[46:34] them and then they're
[46:36] done now I want to read what brother mam
[46:38] said right after the prayer line just
[46:40] nine minutes of straight prayer and they
[46:41] sing only believe the whole nine minutes
[46:43] nine minutes
[46:44] straight brother Jess you sing that song
[46:47] again Yes again Hallelujah God likes
[46:50] that song Amen only

[46:54] I've done to you you've called me your
[46:56] pastor and so say well for so I am if I
[46:59] your pastor have been identified by
[47:00] Jesus Christ that I do his work then
[47:03] believe my word by acting this faith I'm
[47:07] Sorry by acting this Act of Faith by
[47:09] laying hands on you I've condemned the
[47:10] disease and the afflictions that's
[47:12] bothering you believe that so shall you
[47:14] have your request regardless of what it
[47:15] is for all things are possible to them
[47:18] that believe and when you pray believe
[47:21] that you receive them what you asked for
[47:23] and I truly believe that I receive it
[47:24] and in my heart I accept every one of
[47:26] your healings I accept that it's done
[47:28] brother R says I accept it because
[47:29] you've got perfect Faith God's revealed
[47:32] to you you're going to be made well so I
[47:34] I have perfect Faith because you got
[47:35] perfect
[47:36] Faith amen I believe with all that's in
[47:38] me also with my hands upon these
[47:41] handkerchiefs laying here I've been
[47:42] watching it close I believe that they'll
[47:44] produce just exactly what the people
[47:45] requested I believe
[47:48] it now this is I put um you must read
[47:51] this in my notes I must read this okay
[47:52] just bear with me this is coming into
[47:55] that third poll now what was the third
[47:57] poll the opening of the word and he gave
[47:59] five examples of speaking the word of
[48:01] God now this was this was in August so
[48:04] August September October November
[48:05] December so four months later brother
[48:07] gave those uh four those five examples
[48:10] of speaking the word remember he spoke
[48:11] to the snowstorm remember yeah he he
[48:13] spoke to his wife's tumor I could never
[48:15] think of the other ones there's three
[48:16] other ones he spoke those five signs of
[48:19] the third
[48:20] pole yep that's right the fish were
[48:23] spoken back to life that's right that's
[48:25] three of them uh Sunny Shimp was the
[48:27] fourth one now who's got the fifth one
[48:30] who's got the
[48:31] memory but so we got four out of five
[48:37] Hallelujah brother Ram said I want to
[48:39] ask you a sincere question look at this
[48:40] question he asked him you that passed
[48:42] through the prayer line can you actually
[48:44] believe and feel now that there's
[48:46] something happened in you since you've
[48:48] had hands laid on you raise your hand
[48:49] there it is this is what we waited for
[48:52] this third pole is just starting to
[48:53] bloom now I did this for a purpose
[48:57] now look at that there's my 45 minute
[48:58] timer so I'll go 15 more minutes
[49:02] God's look at that brother random
[49:04] brought this down to the same condition
[49:06] as the woman touching His Garment she
[49:09] felt the healing in her body and brother
[49:12] Ram says don't you get in this prayer
[49:13] line unless God's revealed God's going
[49:15] to heal you and then he asked how many
[49:17] can actually feel you're better and all
[49:20] the hands went up amen
[49:23] hallelujah now church with him
[49:25] Discerning no doubt the Holy Ghost was
[49:27] there revealing with him Discerning and
[49:29] telling these secrets and thoughts no
[49:30] doubt those people could feel the
[49:31] presence of God that's how many times it
[49:34] is with you when you feel God's presence
[49:36] you'll come up for prayer right you
[49:38] don't come up for prayer if you don't
[49:39] feel God's presence do you you wait till
[49:43] you feel God how many times have I seen
[49:45] amen pull you over there sister who and
[49:47] come up for prayer how many times have I
[49:49] seen that I like that amen or vice versa
[49:54] Hallelujah but that's when you know
[49:56] God's there when you feel the presence
[49:57] of God that's when you go for
[50:01] prayer he said I did this for a purpose
[50:03] I'm working out something see it's
[50:06] taking a charge of faith and going right
[50:08] back to begin and come in to kind of
[50:11] raise Faith to a bracket where you've
[50:13] never noticed that way before not a
[50:15] faith but a perfect
[50:18] Faith see a full Revelation I've got a
[50:22] full Revelation God's going to heal me
[50:23] in the prayer line I got a full
[50:25] Revelation I can speak the word of God
[50:30] he says and I watch a perfect god with a
[50:33] perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by
[50:35] his perfect word which is sharper than a
[50:37] two-edged sword and to discerner the
[50:39] thoughts and Tents of the heart now
[50:41] we're coming into Perfection because the
[50:43] people has to come to this in order for
[50:45] the
[50:47] Rapture Church we're going to have a
[50:49] revelation at the time of the Rapture if
[50:51] we're alive we're going to have a
[50:52] revelation the Rapture is near
[50:54] Hallelujah but said well see our loved
[50:57] ones we'll see the dead in Christ rise
[50:59] no doubt we'd have perfect Faith
[51:01] Hallelujah that's why I believe that's
[51:03] so important for us to see the dead in
[51:05] Christ rise first that would raise your
[51:08] faith
[51:10] Hallelujah if if a dream will raise your
[51:12] faith what will seeing a theophany do to
[51:14] you if you actually saw a theophany
[51:17] while you're awake but man said he'
[51:18] pinched his finger am I
[51:21] awake I mean what would seeing uh John
[51:24] Wesley or Martin Luther or brother
[51:25] random or Paul or Peter what would that
[51:27] do to your faith it goes Skyrocket High
[51:30] it raise you to a different
[51:33] bracket trusting in a perfect god with a
[51:35] perfect promise with the perfect word
[51:37] hallelujah perfect
[51:43] Faith he said we're coming now to that
[51:45] Perfection because they got to have it
[51:47] in order for the Rapture that's what's
[51:48] holding it away right now is waiting for
[51:50] the church to come into that per perfect
[51:52] raptured Faith so see we can't do it
[51:54] till God brings us to it
[51:56] we've been waiting 59 Years brother
[51:58] we're almost at
[51:59] 60 looking for it means now look what
[52:01] brother says if you want rap how many
[52:03] want rapturing Faith I've read this
[52:05] before but now I get to read it in you
[52:06] into the context so you can hear it it
[52:08] means a lot of Shaving down for
[52:11] me it means a lot for you but together
[52:15] we'll make it by the grace of God I'm
[52:18] glad I got some amens on that Hallelujah
[52:20] I don't want to be the only one saying
[52:21] Amen to that I've read that numerous
[52:23] times over the years of being a pastor
[52:26] this is what this is the context he says
[52:28] it in we just had a service where every
[52:30] person knew they were going to get
[52:31] healed then they could feel they were
[52:33] going to get
[52:34] healed and then he says we got to have
[52:36] more of this if we want to go in the
[52:37] Rapture praise God Amen and God will
[52:40] bring us to it h by the grace of God
[52:46] hallelujah that's why this is no no
[52:48] doubt no wonder why people sung a song
[52:50] about this I've heard recognizing your
[52:54] day serpent SE and perfect faith and the
[52:58] church said what's next on Sunday the
[53:01] breach and the message of Grace and Lord
[53:05] I Thank You amen I thank you for showing
[53:08] me what perfect faith is it's a perfect
[53:10] Revelation Hallelujah and God has to
[53:12] bring it to me and he'll do it by his
[53:16] grace he will he'll cause the conditions
[53:19] of my life to get desperate where I'm
[53:20] driven into this through prayer and
[53:22] fasting or he he'll have me in
[53:24] Consecration and I'll just speak the
[53:26] word of God and God will
[53:31] answer this is the same sermon where
[53:33] brother Braham said God challenged him
[53:34] to speak the squirrels into existence
[53:36] just like Jesus challenged them why
[53:38] don't you speak to the
[53:39] storm why don't you speak to it where's
[53:41] your faith
[53:50] Hallelujah he said if he can create
[53:52] squirrels which has no way at all or
[53:54] anything there to believe it's my own
[53:56] faith that goes and does that my faith
[53:58] in what he challenged me to ask
[54:01] for so that's where it's going to take
[54:03] some maturity Lord are you challenging
[54:06] me to ask the word are you challenging
[54:08] me to speak the
[54:10] word that's what brother man had to deal
[54:12] with Lord you're challenging me okay
[54:15] I'll speak
[54:16] it right he had to be in a consecrated
[54:20] condition in order to do that that's
[54:21] what we need conse
[54:23] consecration now look what he says after
[54:25] this
[54:31] he said the god of heaven knows that's
[54:32] true can he also heal the sick if he can
[54:35] lift my faith up this way even for the
[54:38] people even if they can't climb to that
[54:40] bracket if they can't do it he can use
[54:42] my faith he can lift me up to that place
[54:44] and I'm climbing for you I'm believing
[54:45] for you I'm speaking for
[54:47] you right didn't Jesus do that didn't
[54:50] Jesus do miracles for people remember in
[54:52] John chapter 5 Jesus healed that
[54:54] paralyzed man and he didn't even ask for
[54:56] theal healing remember that is that
[54:58] beautiful amen that's beautiful he
[55:01] didn't even no no doubt he was praying
[55:02] for you know for years and asking God
[55:04] remember he's trying to get to the water
[55:05] but somebody always beat him to the
[55:07] water when the angel served the
[55:08] water and Jesus said pick up your bed
[55:11] and
[55:12] walk he didn't ask him do you want to be
[55:14] healed he said pick up your bed and walk
[55:16] amen his faith ministered to that man
[55:19] and gave him what he desired Hallelujah
[55:21] brother said that's what my faith did
[55:23] for some of
[55:24] you Hallelujah
