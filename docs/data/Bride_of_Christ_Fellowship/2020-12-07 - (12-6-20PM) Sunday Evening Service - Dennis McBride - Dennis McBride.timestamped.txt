[31:50] night in our home you know the
[31:52] some of the things that were said

[31:56] we needed to hear that by god's grace so
[31:58] the lord was really good to us so the
[32:00] lord has really blessed
[32:02] us uh especially use that sermon to help
[32:05] our families so
[32:06] we're grateful for god's grace so let's
[32:09] just sing one more song here

[33:13] [Music]

[34:33] trials and i learned how to lean
[34:36] praise the lord and depend on him amen
[34:39] god bless you
[34:41] this is our final service for
[34:45] for this time here now so uh
[34:51] i might even call this a sermon net
[34:55] i don't think it's going to be that that
[34:57] long at all
[34:59] i just it's kind of a continuation from
[35:02] this morning
[35:04] uh i'm gonna use a different topic
[35:08] but it's gonna be along the same theme
[35:11] of uh now when i say the same thing
[35:15] going to be dealing with love amen so
[35:18] uh let's pray god just have his way
[35:21] let's bow heavenly father we thank you
[35:24] for all things
[35:26] you've kept us lord you've blessed our
[35:28] hearts father you
[35:30] failed us lord so god we just invite you
[35:33] again lord just to have your way
[35:35] hallelujah
[35:37] but i love that about your prophet's
[35:39] ministry lord his
[35:40] how he depended on you yes and lord his
[35:43] respect for you father god he
[35:46] he waited on you lord god and until you
[35:49] came and moved in your own way
[35:52] and father that's a lesson to us lord we
[35:55] desire that same thing
[35:56] father because we realize that's how you
[35:59] purpose for it to be
[36:01] once we realize that we can do nothing
[36:03] without you all we can do is wait on you
[36:06] so lord help us tonight we pray for
[36:09] those that are not here lord give them
[36:11] strength lord and everything they stand
[36:13] in need of
[36:14] you know all things father hallelujah
[36:17] granted we pray in jesus christ's name
[36:19] we ask you
[36:20] amen amen
[36:23] amen all right uh
[36:32] as an opening scripture let's go to
[36:34] first john chapter four
[36:37] and we're going to start at verse seven
[36:41] first john four starting at verse seven
[36:49] first john four starting at verse seven
[36:51] it says beloved
[36:53] let us love one another for god is
[36:56] for love is of god and everyone that
[36:59] loveth is born of god
[37:01] and knoweth god he that loveth not
[37:04] knoweth not god
[37:06] for god is love in this was manifested
[37:10] the love of god
[37:11] toward us because that god sent his his
[37:14] only begotten son
[37:15] into the world that we might live
[37:18] through him
[37:20] herein is love not that we loved god
[37:24] and i i want to emphasize this because
[37:26] it stood out to me as i was reading it
[37:28] yes he says herein is love
[37:33] not that we love god but that he loved
[37:37] us
[37:39] so he loved us when we didn't love him
[37:42] love him
[37:43] he loved us when we couldn't love him
[37:50] see that right yes okay
[37:54] so this is the love that he's talking
[37:55] about he says but
[37:57] but that he loved us and sent his son to
[37:59] be the propitiation
[38:00] for our sins so now watch this
[38:04] in light of the emphasis that i just
[38:06] made he says beloved
[38:08] if god so loved us
[38:11] we ought also to love one another amen
[38:16] in what way even if somebody doesn't
[38:19] love you
[38:21] you'll be able to love them anyway
[38:26] regardless
[38:30] no man has seen god at any time he says
[38:32] if we love one another god dwelleth in
[38:34] us
[38:35] and his love is perfected in us
[38:39] amen may the lord bless his word saints
[38:41] she may be seated
[38:45] so uh tonight we want to take a topic of
[38:49] the challenge
[38:50] of love the challenge
[38:55] of love
[38:59] amen
[39:06] how many realize that it's a challenge
[39:12] amen because what god is asking of us
[39:15] is is just so different than the course
[39:19] of the world
[39:21] what we grew up in what we grew up
[39:23] seeing all around us
[39:25] um is contrary of course to the first
[39:28] nature
[39:29] uh but it's it's just it's just quite
[39:31] different
[39:33] um but nonetheless though he's requiring
[39:35] it from us
[39:38] now that goes along what we said this
[39:39] morning because the love of god the
[39:42] bible says is shed abroad in our hearts
[39:45] by the holy ghost right
[39:49] so that's and let me read this real
[39:51] quick because
[39:53] like i don't want to keep you long i'm
[39:55] just going to touch on a few key points
[39:57] that i feel led to and then
[39:59] we'll stop this is from the message of
[40:03] god projecting his love and i believe
[40:06] this
[40:07] he says love should govern the home
[40:10] how many believe that amen he says love
[40:14] is the greatest force that was ever put
[40:16] into the power of man
[40:18] a home that's not disciplined by love
[40:21] is not much of a home yeah and i want to
[40:25] say that a church that's not disciplined
[40:27] not
[40:27] by love is not much of a church
[40:30] praise the lord amen he says if the
[40:33] husband and wife doesn't solemnly love
[40:36] each other
[40:36] they cannot trust each other that's why
[40:39] i think that instead of resting our
[40:41] faith upon some emotion which is all
[40:43] right
[40:44] or some gift which is all right he says
[40:47] like shouting speaking with tongues or
[40:49] with
[40:49] other things that we take for saying
[40:52] that we have the holy spirit
[40:54] when we do this he says those things are
[40:56] all right
[40:57] but if we would come back to the
[40:59] principle love
[41:01] first and this is key
[41:05] we would come back to the principle love
[41:07] first and then
[41:08] those things i think our church would
[41:11] progress a lot
[41:12] faster if we would get god first
[41:16] and god is love he says now love
[41:19] is in two different words two different
[41:22] meanings
[41:23] in the greek he says one of them is
[41:26] filio called filio that's the love that
[41:28] you have for your wife
[41:30] he says agapo is is the love divine love
[41:34] now the love that you have for your wife
[41:36] he says and the love
[41:38] and the love of god is so contrary
[41:41] now i want to stop here for a moment
[41:43] because he's going to say something at
[41:45] the end of this
[41:46] that was it kind of hit me
[41:50] all right because uh
[41:53] we can account anything i'll say it in
[41:57] this way we can account
[41:59] anything to ourselves
[42:02] right we can say i have the love of god
[42:07] right but does that make it so
[42:11] you might want it but if you have it
[42:16] it speaks for itself
[42:20] it'll show itself it don't have to be
[42:23] spoken for
[42:24] and that's what i'm realizing more and
[42:26] more saints is like
[42:28] it really it really it really takes less
[42:31] talk
[42:32] you don't have to say a word you don't
[42:34] have to say nothing about what you have
[42:36] or who you are
[42:37] it'll manifest itself on its own
[42:40] because it's a living word living on the
[42:42] inside of you
[42:44] isn't that right amen amen you don't you
[42:47] don't have to say well uh
[42:49] you know i have the third pull no we'll
[42:51] see it
[42:52] that's right it'll be seen now god have
[42:55] to give
[42:56] he has to give individuals eyes to see
[43:00] right because somebody can look at the
[43:02] word made flesh
[43:03] and then not even see that it's the word
[43:05] made flesh
[43:07] if god allows your eyes to be closed
[43:09] they'll be closed
[43:11] and i believe also we touched upon a few
[43:13] things there with brother branham said
[43:14] god is so
[43:16] he just handles things in such a way
[43:18] until he'll actually cause things to be
[43:20] said and done in such a strange way
[43:23] until it'll cause people to become
[43:25] confused
[43:26] right he said it'll cause people to even
[43:28] leave
[43:29] that's right he said what is he doing
[43:31] he's fitting down the crowd
[43:34] and i believe he gave john 6 as an
[43:36] example
[43:39] jesus sat right there and here they are
[43:42] confused about what he just said eat my
[43:44] flesh drink my blood
[43:46] and they're sitting there reasoning upon
[43:48] that and then he steps to him and says
[43:50] something to make it even worse
[43:54] and he didn't explain nothing right
[43:57] that's right
[43:58] left them right there in their own
[44:00] internal battles
[44:01] over what he said because he know he
[44:04] knew of course because of who he was
[44:06] whoever was ordained to remain they were
[44:09] going to remain
[44:11] because he turned he turned to the
[44:13] disciples and said will you go also
[44:18] and peter he's like where are we going
[44:20] to thou alone has the words of eternal
[44:23] life
[44:24] and guess what saints i feel that same
[44:26] way about this message
[44:28] amen amen amen
[44:32] it's the word of god peter couldn't
[44:35] explain
[44:36] why he felt that way but it was god
[44:40] communicating with that seed that was on
[44:42] the inside of him
[44:46] and because that seed was present it
[44:48] dismissed everything
[44:50] that tried to cause him to think
[44:52] differently
[44:56] watch this though because people can say
[44:59] i have
[45:00] love but then sometimes when you listen
[45:03] to them and when you watch how they
[45:05] respond to things and how they handle
[45:07] people
[45:11] it just raises a little question in
[45:13] there
[45:14] i wonder if it's the real thing watch
[45:18] how he says this
[45:19] he says now the love that you have for
[45:21] your wife and the love that and the love
[45:23] and the love of god is so contrary
[45:27] just listen to this the love you have
[45:29] for your wife if a man would insult her
[45:32] you would kill him on the spot
[45:35] with filial love he says with that kind
[45:38] of a love of filial love
[45:41] he says but with agopo love you pray for
[45:44] his lost soul
[45:49] he says that's the difference
[45:54] then he goes on to say there's two
[45:56] different types of love and i'm almost
[45:58] sure that many of us has been deceived
[46:04] with having familial love and thinking
[46:07] it's a gobble love
[46:15] a love that comes from god it has
[46:17] certain characteristics about it
[46:20] yes praise the lord and that brings me
[46:24] to this next scripture here
[46:26] watch this now because this is love
[46:29] speaking and expressing these particular
[46:31] things to us
[46:33] watch what it says in luke chapter 6
[46:37] starting at verse 27.
[46:43] amen amen amen how many realize the time
[46:47] that we're in
[46:49] that capstone
[46:54] it's the fullness of christ it's more
[46:57] than just
[46:58] the opening of all the church ages
[47:00] opening of all it's the fullness of
[47:02] christ here to express himself
[47:04] through a bride in these last days amen
[47:08] amen and we were made for this hour amen
[47:11] amen what i'm talking about is within
[47:13] every single one of us right now
[47:16] children is in you right now amen
[47:20] all we have to do is stay within his
[47:22] presence and even he comes in and helps
[47:24] us with that
[47:26] yes sir because we within ourselves
[47:28] we're not disciplined enough like we
[47:30] should be
[47:34] i thought i was going to preach on that
[47:36] brother
[47:38] hey man i've been ministering on the
[47:40] subject here on the hand of the diligent
[47:43] and uh i i was like lord is this the
[47:47] i
[47:48] and it didn't go that way so but
[47:51] nonetheless though we don't have the
[47:52] disciplines that we should and god has
[47:55] ways of pushing us and bringing us
[47:57] yes that's the purpose for trials right
[48:00] the purpose for trials is not to give us
[48:02] a hard time take us through mind battles
[48:04] make us feel oppressed depressed
[48:06] discouraged
[48:07] right no it's to bring us to a closer
[48:09] walk
[48:12] in relationship with christ
[48:16] you ever wonder why why am i going
[48:18] through this that's why he wants you to
[48:20] trust in him more
[48:22] he wants us to have a closer bond a
[48:24] stronger bond
[48:26] watch this verse 27 of luke chapter 6
[48:29] it says but i say unto you which here he
[48:32] says
[48:33] love your enemies
[48:36] do good to them with which hate you i'm
[48:39] talking about the challenge of love
[48:42] so if he's saying love your enemies and
[48:44] do good to them that hate you
[48:48] we should understand then that god will
[48:50] allow enemies to arise in our lives
[48:54] we should understand that god will cause
[48:56] people or rather allow people to be
[48:58] anointed with spirits
[49:00] that have caused them to hate you
[49:04] but why does that happen many times we
[49:07] get confused
[49:08] because we see i'm reading this right
[49:11] i'm preaching it right
[49:13] but we're not always mindful of things
[49:15] as we should be
[49:17] especially if we haven't been
[49:19] consecrating ourselves or whatever
[49:21] the enemy can come in with a sneak
[49:23] attack and he'll hit us with a little
[49:24] sucker punch
[49:26] and it throw you off guard you get all
[49:28] disoriented you know what i mean like
[49:30] it really catches you off guard and you
[49:32] don't know what's going you got to
[49:33] gather yourself
[49:35] because it was a swift hit you didn't
[49:37] expect
[49:38] a punch from the enemy that you didn't
[49:40] see coming amen
[49:42] but watch god permits those things
[49:46] god will permit people it may even be
[49:49] for no reason at all he'll permit people
[49:51] to actually hate you
[49:53] right yes but what is it for
[49:58] it's for your growth amen
[50:01] yes sir it's for our growth
[50:05] isn't that right but at the time at the
[50:07] time we
[50:08] thinking like that because when somebody
[50:11] is persecuting you or
[50:13] or having a certain feeling as that of
[50:16] hate towards you amen
[50:17] you don't you don't register like that
[50:19] god got to help your mind to come into
[50:21] the right channel of thoughts
[50:24] because outside of that we'll take it as
[50:27] flesh on flesh
[50:28] i don't know why they hate me and if
[50:30] you're not careful it'll lead you
[50:32] into a certain space and place
[50:36] that actually drive the spirit of god
[50:38] away from you
[50:39] that's right so god permits these things
[50:42] our saints as lessons it's the only real
[50:46] lessons we
[50:46] we got it's like he teaches us through
[50:48] life's experiences
[50:51] but it's a challenge see because when
[50:53] somebody is hating you
[50:55] and for whatever the reason might be
[50:56] that's come about man it hurts
[51:00] you can feel like why are you treating
[51:02] me like this why you feel that way to
[51:03] what
[51:03] what did i do to you
[51:08] it leaves you feeling like that yes sir
[51:12] but god is sitting there watching the
[51:13] whole thing and he's letting you go
[51:15] through it
[51:18] yes sir amen he says love your enemies
[51:22] he says do good to them which hate you
[51:25] so it's bad enough that they hate you
[51:29] so now he's requiring us to turn around
[51:32] and do good to
[51:35] right them you know they hate you and
[51:38] here you are driving down the road and
[51:39] you see them broke down
[51:46] you drive back and you drive by that
[51:48] like you don't see him
[51:51] like you look like something interesting
[51:53] on this side of the street
[51:56] no god listen god will permit those
[51:58] kinds of situations
[52:01] put you in a place amen the way his word
[52:04] can be made manifest
[52:06] but when that right love is not in our
[52:08] hearts being shed abroad by the holy
[52:10] ghost
[52:11] we'll have carnal reactions
[52:18] bless them that curse you
[52:21] isn't that something you're being cursed
[52:25] you're being slandered yes
[52:28] and god says bless them
[52:33] all the feelings and the thoughts on the
[52:35] inside of you because of
[52:37] of how they're coming against you or
[52:38] whatever the case might be
[52:41] it's contrary to that but when the love
[52:43] of god is in our hearts since
[52:45] it'll oppress us so much we won't be
[52:47] able to get away from it
[52:52] that's just how you won't be able to get
[52:53] away from it you may respond listen i'm
[52:56] not gonna say that you can't initially
[52:57] have a wrong response that's right
[53:00] that's exactly right but when that love
[53:03] is in there when god is in your soul
[53:05] dwelling in your soul you won't be able
[53:07] to continue like that
[53:08] that's right amen amen he'll even have
[53:12] you go and apologize
[53:16] why because it's a display of royalty
[53:19] yes remember character is not given
[53:24] it's a victory if it's a victory that
[53:28] means there has to be a fight
[53:31] there has to be a challenge there has to
[53:33] be opposition
[53:35] isn't that right that god permits
[53:38] because if he's requiring this character
[53:40] then he's saying i'm allowing
[53:42] these obstacles these challenges these
[53:44] conditions to come about in your life
[53:47] because of the calling i have in your
[53:49] life
[53:51] you ordain to manifest me clearly more
[53:54] than any other age before
[54:00] amen as we come down to verse 31
[54:03] same chapter he says and as you would
[54:06] that
[54:07] men should do to you do ye
[54:10] also to them likewise
[54:16] so based off of how somebody handles you
[54:18] or deals with you in a given situation
[54:21] if it's in a way that you don't
[54:23] appreciate
[54:25] then god is saying now you turn around
[54:28] and you deal with them in a way that you
[54:30] would appreciate being dealt with
[54:35] it's a challenge you have to be willing
[54:38] to die
[54:41] i say that saints because in my
[54:44] experiences
[54:45] i've seen to where i've seen places
[54:48] where people
[54:49] they're here they've heard many times
[54:51] over as yourselves these same things
[54:55] they know that the bible says that if
[54:57] you don't forgive you won't be forgiven
[55:00] they know that but people sit
[55:04] and harbor feelings and unforgiveness
[55:07] in their hearts
[55:11] and say they know the scripture but you
[55:13] say you know it but
[55:14] you don't act like you know it so i
[55:16] don't think you really know it it hasn't
[55:17] struck you yet because if it really hits
[55:20] you
[55:21] you will you will quickly repent you
[55:24] will quickly go to your knees
[55:25] you will quickly actual forgiveness you
[55:28] will try to make things right
[55:32] if it really is in your heart that you
[55:35] really understand like you say you do
[55:37] that's what i'm talking about is more
[55:39] than just talking yes
[55:43] everybody going oh i love you i love you
[55:45] i'm okay okay okay
[55:46] let it be put to a challenge and that's
[55:49] that it'll show what's on the inside
[55:51] then it'll show
[55:52] what what what's really in there
[55:55] yes verse 32 says for if ye love
[56:00] them which love you he says what
[56:04] thank have you
[56:08] for sinners also love those that love
[56:10] them
[56:13] isn't that something watch this things
[56:16] it goes a little deeper because
[56:18] we have all kinds of oppositions and all
[56:21] kinds of things that rise up against us
[56:23] and in our hearts in our
[56:26] natural way of thinking the best way to
[56:29] to
[56:30] to to deal with certain kinds of trouble
[56:32] is to avoid it
[56:33] so if a person has become troublesome to
[56:36] you
[56:37] then your resort is i can just stay out
[56:39] of their way i ain't got to see him i
[56:41] ain't got to talk to him i ain't got to
[56:42] shake the hand
[56:44] i ain't got to do none of that
[56:48] now it's done right it's solved
[56:54] but in god's sight when i was in boot
[56:57] camp marine corps boot camp
[56:59] we had to go through every obstacle you
[57:02] couldn't run around none of them
[57:05] and it was a challenge yeah the one i
[57:08] had the hardest time with was climbing
[57:10] the road
[57:11] because you had to have a technique with
[57:13] how you use both of your feet together
[57:15] to kind of
[57:16] climb and then be able to hold yourself
[57:18] at a certain point
[57:19] so you can go up and climb some more
[57:21] then you raise your feet up and lock
[57:23] them in together with the rope
[57:24] it'll hold you and you can climb up some
[57:26] more and i just couldn't get that foot
[57:28] action
[57:29] so when i got to the ropes i just use
[57:31] all all arm strength
[57:35] i just go to the top and come down but
[57:37] one time a drill instructor was right
[57:38] there at the base
[57:40] and i got to the obstacle and i was
[57:42] going up and i hit the top he said what
[57:43] did you just do
[57:45] i said i climbed the road he said no huh
[57:49] and he made me sit there and practice
[57:52] that foot technique
[57:54] until i got it how many realize that's
[57:57] how god is
[57:59] he don't let you bypass no obstacles
[58:02] amen if you're meant to go through it
[58:04] you're gonna sit there and learn
[58:06] what it is he wants you to learn until
[58:07] you can pass it successfully
[58:12] ain't no way around it right
[58:18] praise god let's go on down
[58:21] if you do good to them which do good to
[58:23] you
[58:24] what think have you he says for sinners
[58:27] also do even the same
[58:30] you see the calling yeah everybody else
[58:33] is like that but that's not
[58:35] listen that's not how i am
[58:38] so what he's expressing here is exactly
[58:41] how he loved those that didn't love him
[58:44] he's good to those that are not good to
[58:46] him
[58:49] and it's it's not it's not a struggle
[58:52] right you understand it's just a natural
[58:54] flow by naked
[58:58] and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope
[59:01] to receive
[59:02] what think have you but sinners also
[59:05] lend to sinners to receive
[59:07] as much again
[59:10] now this is a lesson i learned a long
[59:12] time ago
[59:14] because people don't always pay you back
[59:16] like they're supposed to
[59:19] and versus me getting all twisted up in
[59:21] the night i say okay this is what i'll
[59:22] do
[59:24] i'm gonna let you have whatever i ain't
[59:26] gonna miss
[59:29] cause then i'm gonna handle mine
[59:32] i ain't gonna have no mind battles about
[59:34] you not paying my money back
[59:36] that was i'm like that's my way and that
[59:38] that's helped me
[59:39] for quite some time amen but we ain't
[59:42] talking about that here
[59:45] we're talking about the real thing he's
[59:46] talking about actually having the love
[59:48] of god
[59:49] so he's speaking this to them but he
[59:51] knew full well
[59:52] whomever i'm speaking this to in order
[59:54] for them to manifest that
[59:56] they got to go all the way to pentecost
[59:59] because once they
[1:00:00] hit there they'll receive the power and
[1:00:02] the goods
[1:00:03] to be able to live this word
[1:00:06] so he was he was teaching them a high
[1:00:08] standard
[1:00:09] but he knew as he was teaching them this
[1:00:11] is only for those that are predestinated
[1:00:14] amen nobody else will be able to live
[1:00:16] this kind of a life
[1:00:19] they'll try but you know how it is when
[1:00:21] you're trying to do something you get
[1:00:23] tired
[1:00:24] you get weary with it and you put it
[1:00:27] down
[1:00:29] amen it don't last it fizzles out
[1:00:33] it sparks then it fizzles
[1:00:37] right that's the truth that's what i'm
[1:00:40] talking about now
[1:00:42] all right he says but love your enemies
[1:00:47] and do good and land hoping for nothing
[1:00:50] again
[1:00:51] and your rewards shall be great and ye
[1:00:54] shall be the children of the highest
[1:00:57] for he is kind unto the unthankful
[1:01:01] and to who
[1:01:04] isn't that something
[1:01:08] and the reason why he's presenting this
[1:01:11] like this saints is because he knows
[1:01:12] that we come from him
[1:01:15] so whatever he is like i said it's
[1:01:17] within us to be that same exact thing
[1:01:21] it's already in you we just got to lay
[1:01:23] in his presence
[1:01:25] praise the lord amen all right i'm about
[1:01:28] to stop
[1:01:30] amen i got this one particular thing
[1:01:34] here i want to leave with you
[1:01:36] there's no point in just continuing on
[1:01:39] with the thought because
[1:01:40] the bulk of what i it ties in with this
[1:01:43] morning and
[1:01:44] and it's it's flowing along pretty
[1:01:46] nicely where the lord is allowing me to
[1:01:48] hit these key things here
[1:01:50] so i'm just going with this flow and i
[1:01:51] feel led to stop so
[1:01:53] but i just want to kind of leave you
[1:01:56] with a few nuggets here this right here
[1:01:58] is from the message of love
[1:02:01] and this is the part here where he's
[1:02:03] dealing with the maniac but just listen
[1:02:05] to how this
[1:02:06] this plays out he says so the man got
[1:02:09] real close to me and the people just
[1:02:11] hushed
[1:02:12] and he draw back his now this was a an
[1:02:15] ordained trial
[1:02:18] it was a challenge
[1:02:21] amen but the lord had equipped this
[1:02:24] prophet
[1:02:26] but it took this to be able to bring it
[1:02:28] out to display it
[1:02:30] so it could be an example for you and i
[1:02:32] today
[1:02:34] amen and he draws back his great
[1:02:37] his his great um his great hope
[1:02:41] oh man and he draws back his great he
[1:02:44] says hawk
[1:02:45] and spit all over my face
[1:02:49] it says he said you snake in the grass
[1:02:52] i'm going to show you how much of a
[1:02:53] servant of god you are
[1:02:55] i'm going to knock you way out in the
[1:02:57] middle of that audience he says he was
[1:02:58] well able to keep his threat
[1:03:00] he says but he didn't know god he says
[1:03:04] that was the main thing
[1:03:06] i kept real still never said a thing
[1:03:09] and my heart and i notice he just got
[1:03:11] his face just got spit in
[1:03:14] but under this anointing of love under
[1:03:16] this agape law of anointing watch where
[1:03:18] his thoughts were
[1:03:24] he says and my heart was going out to
[1:03:26] him
[1:03:28] with spit dripping down his skin
[1:03:32] it never even phased him that wasn't an
[1:03:35] act
[1:03:37] that wasn't a put on that's something
[1:03:40] that you got to have
[1:03:44] it takes you out of a carnal frame of
[1:03:46] mind it takes you completely out of
[1:03:48] it it's just the mind of god now
[1:03:53] here he is with spit dripping down his
[1:03:55] face
[1:03:57] he says and my heart was going out to
[1:03:59] him
[1:04:00] now you just can't imagine that it's got
[1:04:03] to be
[1:04:04] real the people have seen
[1:04:07] so much put on love till they're sick
[1:04:10] and tired of it
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:21] he says be what you are if you're a
[1:04:23] christian be one god's grace will make
[1:04:26] you will make you one
[1:04:29] he says and the man walked closer to me
[1:04:31] and i loved him
[1:04:34] with spit dripping down his face
[1:04:37] the man walked close to me he said and i
[1:04:40] loved him and he was threatening brother
[1:04:41] branham
[1:04:42] he hated him the enemy of satan was on
[1:04:45] the inside of him having full control
[1:04:49] and this wasn't an act he ain't just
[1:04:51] saying good words for the sake of the
[1:04:53] audience for the sake of us is going to
[1:04:55] read it on down the line no
[1:04:57] he's talking about what was actually
[1:04:59] happening on the inside of him he was
[1:05:01] honestly giving a confession look
[1:05:02] this is what was going on yes
[1:05:09] he says i he says and i loved him
[1:05:12] because i knew
[1:05:14] i knew he didn't mean that
[1:05:18] that sounds familiar remember calvary
[1:05:22] remember i believe it was stephen
[1:05:25] stephen was being hit with stones that
[1:05:28] was breaking his bones
[1:05:32] he was dying but look at what came out
[1:05:35] of his mouth
[1:05:38] the same thing that came out of the
[1:05:39] mouth of the one that was hanging on the
[1:05:40] cross
[1:05:41] yes amen he asked for their forgiveness
[1:05:44] let it not be laid to their charge
[1:05:46] yes how
[1:05:49] that was by that was that love see
[1:05:52] brother branham said it's two kinds he
[1:05:53] said the love that you have for your
[1:05:55] wife fill your love it'll cause you to
[1:05:57] kill a man that insults her
[1:05:58] but under a different kind of love with
[1:06:00] that same man that same match it'll
[1:06:02] cause you to pray for his sinful soul
[1:06:04] amen praise the lord
[1:06:09] amen he says i thought it's the devil
[1:06:12] that makes that man say that
[1:06:15] he's the man who would love his family
[1:06:17] like i do mine
[1:06:19] he would he he would like to eat and
[1:06:22] drink and fellowship
[1:06:23] but the thing of it is is because the
[1:06:26] devil has possessed him
[1:06:28] he's a human being the same as i am
[1:06:31] those kind of thoughts so he's saying
[1:06:34] he's saying this but it was something
[1:06:35] that was just
[1:06:37] taking control he says and you
[1:06:41] and you can't do this unless god does it
[1:06:44] for you
[1:06:45] and when he got close to me he drew back
[1:06:48] his arms
[1:06:49] and he said i'm going to knock you out
[1:06:52] into the middle of the audience and
[1:06:53] break every bone in your little body old
[1:06:55] frail body of yours
[1:06:57] he says i never even opened my mouth and
[1:06:59] said a word
[1:07:05] so it spoke for itself what i just said
[1:07:08] you understand man
[1:07:10] amen the only way that we can enter into
[1:07:12] this like we're supposed to
[1:07:14] it's just to give ourselves more to god
[1:07:16] period
[1:07:17] amen just every day just try to live as
[1:07:20] close to him as possible
[1:07:22] allow his grace to work freely in our
[1:07:24] lives
[1:07:25] and then it'll just be there when it's
[1:07:27] supposed to be there
[1:07:30] you don't try to work yourself into it
[1:07:32] don't try to become
[1:07:33] you know just relax
[1:07:36] because for you you will come right into
[1:07:38] it
[1:07:41] amen notice how he says this
[1:07:46] and i'ma stop with this by the grace of
[1:07:48] god he says
[1:07:49] cause we're in the last days where the
[1:07:52] bible exalted
[1:07:53] much more as we see that day approaching
[1:07:56] to love one another with christian love
[1:07:58] and divine love
[1:07:59] to assemble ourselves together in
[1:08:01] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:08:03] and love one another this will all men
[1:08:06] know you're my disciples when you have
[1:08:08] love one for the other that's right stay
[1:08:10] right together
[1:08:12] if the brother you think he's a little
[1:08:14] wrong or the sisters say
[1:08:16] lord don't let me never have the root of
[1:08:18] bitterness spring up
[1:08:20] he says because it'll affect him it'll
[1:08:23] take the christ right out of my life
[1:08:26] see satan don't want us to be mindful of
[1:08:28] these kind of things if somebody do
[1:08:30] something wrong to you
[1:08:31] he won't he want bitterness to be there
[1:08:36] i had a situation recently
[1:08:41] and it was just
[1:08:44] it's like something's wrong it was a way
[1:08:46] that a person was talking to me and
[1:08:47] whatever
[1:08:48] they never told me nothing was wrong or
[1:08:50] whatever but it's just
[1:08:52] when i when i would hear them talk to me
[1:08:54] or something it was just something about
[1:08:55] like something ain't right
[1:08:59] and today i was in a room and i was
[1:09:00] praying and everything and
[1:09:02] and and and
[1:09:07] when they spoke
[1:09:11] their voice had the tone of wounds in it
[1:09:16] i can hear wounds i can hear
[1:09:20] bitterness beyond what the actual words
[1:09:24] were that they were speaking
[1:09:28] and certain little slight actions just
[1:09:31] really it's been it's actually been
[1:09:33] troubling me in my heart since i've been
[1:09:35] here
[1:09:37] so as i'm preaching to you i've been
[1:09:38] asking god to help me because
[1:09:40] i can't even think of what i could have
[1:09:42] done and i'm not going to go into detail
[1:09:45] about anything but
[1:09:46] it's just like my heart is a little
[1:09:47] trouble because you like to get along
[1:09:50] with people
[1:09:51] you know what i mean and when somebody
[1:09:53] begin to handle you in a certain way and
[1:09:55] you're clueless it's like man what's
[1:09:57] going on
[1:10:00] and i i it's something that i'm seeing
[1:10:02] but
[1:10:03] at the same time you just kind of like
[1:10:05] you got to let it ride
[1:10:09] you know the lord allows things like i
[1:10:11] said to come up to see your reaction
[1:10:14] yes yes
[1:10:19] if the brother you think he's a little
[1:10:21] wrong or the sister lord don't let me
[1:10:22] never let have the root of bitterness
[1:10:24] springing up it'll affect him it'll take
[1:10:26] the christ right out of my life
[1:10:28] that poison assets of malice and
[1:10:30] jealousy and hatred that will just take
[1:10:32] the holy spirit right away from you
[1:10:34] this is the one this is why the enemy
[1:10:36] has been working so much in that way
[1:10:38] he's always done that
[1:10:40] but he his atmosphere his breeding
[1:10:43] ground is
[1:10:44] that of of hatred of confusion
[1:10:47] of fussing and fighting and division
[1:10:51] where those things are permitted or
[1:10:52] being yielded to
[1:10:55] he's just that's his breeding ground
[1:10:57] that's his playground
[1:11:00] this is why so many strange things are
[1:11:02] taking place
[1:11:04] and we have to be in a certain place
[1:11:05] with god because remember it was told to
[1:11:07] brother branham
[1:11:08] nothing can make it here without perfect
[1:11:11] love
[1:11:13] because that's how the victory is gained
[1:11:17] the victory that brings about true
[1:11:19] character
[1:11:20] is gain amen through that perfect love
[1:11:23] that comes by the holy ghost
[1:11:25] and you're going to have challenges
[1:11:26] you're going to have things face you
[1:11:28] face to face
[1:11:30] that you got to deal with right
[1:11:33] and in order for you to be able to make
[1:11:35] it there successfully because ain't no
[1:11:37] failures going there no spiritual
[1:11:39] failures only spiritual overcomers
[1:11:43] and how do we overcome saints is through
[1:11:45] the grace and love of god
[1:11:47] in our hearts which is connected to the
[1:11:52] faith
[1:11:55] praise the lord yeah i can preach it but
[1:11:58] lord have mercy on me let this thing
[1:12:00] come alive
[1:12:01] and brother mcbride so y'all think of me
[1:12:04] i'll say
[1:12:04] lord help brother mcbride bless him lord
[1:12:09] and i'll be doing the same
[1:12:12] it'll run him from the tabernacle here
[1:12:14] it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it
[1:12:17] away from here hurt your pastor it'll do
[1:12:19] everything
[1:12:20] he says don't you do that he goes on and
[1:12:23] say just wax he says just white you just
[1:12:25] wax that much closer and
[1:12:27] together draw up take take the buckle
[1:12:30] uh as the brother testified a minister
[1:12:32] here the other night
[1:12:34] about having a buckle seeing it in a
[1:12:36] vision just just that buckles on the
[1:12:38] whole armor of god
[1:12:40] just pull just pull her on tighten up
[1:12:43] move close move right up close to one
[1:12:45] another love one another
[1:12:46] anyhow talk nice about one another
[1:12:50] say nice things about one another and
[1:12:52] god will bless you
[1:12:56] see that's his atmosphere
[1:13:00] amen when he sees that that that in your
[1:13:03] heart
[1:13:04] and i'll share this as i close it
[1:13:07] it really touched me some time ago
[1:13:11] my son dennis he um that's my oldest son
[1:13:15] you know i would teach him you know to
[1:13:18] try to handle things right and
[1:13:20] you know even if somebody is mean to you
[1:13:22] not be mean to them and so on and so
[1:13:24] forth
[1:13:25] you know he was much younger of course
[1:13:27] and he came to me one day and he was
[1:13:29] like you know dad
[1:13:31] he said um
[1:13:34] you know uh the kids you know they would
[1:13:36] make fun of them sometimes you know just
[1:13:38] kids being kids
[1:13:40] and make fun of them sometimes but one
[1:13:42] time one kid punched him in a stomach
[1:13:46] and he was looking at me telling me
[1:13:48] about it and he looked at me and he was
[1:13:50] like dad i
[1:13:51] you know i didn't hit him back dad i you
[1:13:54] know i
[1:13:55] and it's like he was trying to hold
[1:13:59] to my words amen
[1:14:02] i was like boy
[1:14:05] that i was like lord have mercy on me
[1:14:10] me being a natural father and he is my
[1:14:12] son
[1:14:14] trying his best to hold to what his
[1:14:16] daddy said
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:19] in a time like that when he's being
[1:14:21] treated like that
[1:14:24] and he preached to me yeah praise the
[1:14:28] lord
[1:14:28] yes sir amen so saints be encouraged
[1:14:33] um we've experienced a lot it's a lot
[1:14:36] going on but
[1:14:38] you just got to buckle up because
[1:14:40] there's more to come
[1:14:42] amen but for as much as satan begins to
[1:14:46] express himself
[1:14:47] god is here to express more of himself
[1:14:51] amen that's the whole purpose for all of
[1:14:54] this is to bring that push that bride
[1:14:56] into her promised land
[1:14:58] to her positions amen
[1:15:01] and then once that display of god is
[1:15:04] made known and revealed and shown
[1:15:06] forth in the way that he sees fit
[1:15:09] then we out of here amen
[1:15:13] yes so let's just keep one another in
[1:15:16] prayer
[1:15:17] amen and and that the grace of god and
[1:15:19] continue to help us
[1:15:20] and keep us and even though we pray god
[1:15:23] already knows
[1:15:24] all these things and he's going to do
[1:15:25] every bit of it he's watching over us
[1:15:28] he's keeping us and he'll continue to
[1:15:29] keep us
[1:15:30] right but he has us to do these things
[1:15:32] for our benefit he has us to pray for
[1:15:34] our benefit because he already knows
[1:15:36] everything they're going to ask
[1:15:37] for we ask it but it's our way of taking
[1:15:40] time to communicate with him
[1:15:42] yes praise the lord so god bless you
[1:15:46] saints
[1:15:46] amen it's been a blessing to be here
[1:15:50] um to share the thoughts that in my
[1:15:53] heart i felt
[1:15:54] i felt god was leading me to share and
[1:15:58] i'm not doing the ministry no justice at
[1:16:01] all
[1:16:01] i believe god wants to do so much more
[1:16:05] you know when i just want to be able to
[1:16:07] to be able to
[1:16:08] surrender myself so he could do that
[1:16:11] that's my only desire
[1:16:13] so it's been good to be here to see each
[1:16:15] one of you again and some for the first
[1:16:17] time
[1:16:19] for a lot of the kids amen that's good
[1:16:22] let's see everybody again so god bless
[1:16:24] you
[1:16:25] strengthen you and keep you
