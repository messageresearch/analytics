nor constantly watching pray listening for names of God so we could sense your presence so we can vision with all the words we give you glory here that lets this reading that I word in Jesus Christ every since let's take our Bibles revelation 3 verse 7 we read one verse tonight the church age or for tonight Rome I got the key of David witness of that wait upon the Lord their strength I was so tired this morning I was I just woke up tired and depressed I'll just be honest and as I started studying I had to make my badi do it and as I started studying I pray read my Bible I started texting people I sext Connie and different ones in the morning to say hi and God knows by the time I left I was walk out of there with victory so I just is another good lesson for me reminder just give yourself just sacrifice yourself constantly just walk walk in God's timing and you'll he'll refresh you by God's grace so we're very thankful for that by the grace of lord so revelation three seven let's read that together in just a moment here if you're there say Amen if you're there let's read that revelation three seven on three one two three and to the Angel of the Church and Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth Amen may God as busing as the reading of his word you may be seated cuz I did pray for the word already praise the Lord so let's let's connect here Malachi if you want to switch over here and you will have some quotations for us tonight I want to end if we can I want to end by showing the plan of salvation for Jacinda and Jamar and I'm not sure if they know the plan of salvation and so I've been laboring on that the Bible club and so I've kind of prepared to show just a simple outline of the gospel so I like them to see that and the thought just kind of came to me why don't you show that you know since we have visitors tonight and I'm not sure how clearly the gospel has ever been presented but you know there there's a criticism among you know churches that follow the message that they don't preach the cross enough you know and I I don't want to be guilty of that by God's grace the cross is our only source of strength amen we cannot gain any strength from any man or any woman like there's no strength in a human there's only strength in Jesus Christ for the joy of the Lord is our strength we don't get a strength for anything else but it's God's holy spirit that gives us strength we can be encouraged by of course our prophet and and our brothers have you know our sisters in the Lord we can be courage by everybody we needed a prophet no doubt about that no doubt no no doubt we believe that with all of our hearts here but ultimately salvation comes down to us and Jesus cry will we accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God so look at part 4 here tonight by the grace of the Lord we did our text I remember John Wesley's our messenger Philadelphia Church age there's a little more light in this age and the Sardis Age Sunday we spent a lot of time at the end looking at the synagogue of Satan and how jesus promised jesus promised all the liars all the pretenders all the synagogue of Satan and he said even churches that aren't Jewish anyone that says their spirit filled and are not and are lying they're all gonna have to come to the white throne judgment and bow at the feet of Christ and guess who's standing next to Christ you and I Amen so they bow at our feet they bound worship at our feet but they're not bowing to us or worshiping us we are just there when they're bowing to Jesus Christ so I hope everybody caught that by God's grace that's that was the thought there and I'm gonna spend a little more time on the synagogue of satan' because if you know the progression of the church age book we're not there yet we'll get there by the grace of Lord but remember we're looking at this time period so just in in my mind we're looking at this time period so we're looking at about you know 200 300 years ago 1750 to 1906 we're looking at that time period remember you know of course Luther Martin Luther lived in that day John Wesley's living in this or lived in this church age we're talking about today I remember and then our prophet lived from 1906 to 1965 and and I just used this slide from last time the hour temptation was prophetic he's Jesus spoke it to the Philadelphia church age but there's a lap over and it actually applied to our age because we know dispensations carryover promises carry over into different dispensations the Philadelphia Church H of course Philadelphia is a city in Turkey this is like the zoomed out picture there we're looking at the Philadelphia Church age which was a real city that had a real Church and John sent them a real letter but that letter was prophetic they received it you know sometime after 80 90 or 95 but it actually spoke to the future events of the 1700s now we've gone through some really nice progression I'm happy well this is my 43rd sermon on the church ages themselves I'm pretty happy about that plus I've preached sermons on introducing the church ages and then all the symbols are not all but many symbols in the book of Revelation so I probably have over 50 or you know 55 sermons on Revelation I hope you're blessed by God's grace amen cam said he just preached 50 sermons on the seals I thought that was really encouraging and that's the thought brother Graham said you could spend months on just one one church age he said or one seal he said you could spend months just on that one and so I've tried to shorten them I've tried to just you know preach what I felt led to preach so I preached five on Laodicea you know two years ago and though that's the progression we've gone through so I kind of start with a label to see it cuz I didn't know when the rapture was gonna come I thought well we better start with later to see us so we know our church age first but God's given us grace you know and God may give us more grace you know we may there may be more generations we don't know the day in the hour but I just felt burdened to get that to the people in case the erhaps sure did come so brother Branham said every believer goes down thinking the rapture is gonna take place anytime soon he said so that when they're raised they're expecting it they went out expecting it so when they're raised they they have their expectation hallelujah remember there's benefits of these teachings remember brother Branham said the reason he taught it was to give us a basis to give us a settling you know I've talked to individuals and one individual particular said one thing I want more than anything else as a Christian is to have a settled life they just want to they they're they're tired of being tossed to and fro they're tired of not knowing this am I saved am I am i sanctified in my field the Holy Ghost what do I got they're so tired they just want one thing to be settled in church we can be settled by Jesus Christ amen we don't have to be wandering and tossed to and fro them I saved or am I born again or what it what am I you can know what you are you're a child of God amen you're redeemed son or daughter of God a man you can know that but you got to sit still let God work with your heart you got to be humble you got to be obedient you have to repent you have to be sweet to the Holy Spirit now I'm going to skip past this one but basically I'm saying you can't preach verse-by-verse as an evangelist it has to be a pastoral ministry that's from adoption now here's something I haven't know if you've seen this lately has anybody read the introduction in the church age book lately he's anybody read that I think other than brother Adam maybe in the introduction I want you to see some pretty important things here now I hope I hope you can say Amen to these quotes I hope by God's grace and let me say this I read the church age book before I even started preaching so that was literally the foundational teaching that I had before I even started preaching and then if you know well if you've been here a while then you know I preached on the seals in 2007-8 sister bo is here my wife was here bang was here the Grahams were here that might have been it Carrie and a lady might a minute I preached on the seals in two thousand seven or eight nine somewhere around there I can't remember the exact year but listen to this quotation and listen to what the Prophet says about the importance of the church age how many believe these sermons are important honey believe these 43 sermons have been crucial or the bram said they're absolutely essential it's not optional like well it'd be a good idea sometime brother Amen if you want to preach the church ages you know no it's not even optional it is absolutely essential to know these things if you don't know the symbols and the revelations of the first few chapters then you don't even know you can't even decode the rest of the book you can't if you won't accept what the Holy Spirit said the first three chapters you're gonna miss what he says in the rest I don't know about you but I want to understand what he says at the beginning because if I understand the beginning the book like brother man said you can understand the end we want to understand the whole book through this volume this is introduction will concern I'm sorry though this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines God had water baptism found in Revelation chapters one through three its main theme is the setting forth of a detailed study the seven churches now look at this next slide this is necessary not optional it's necessary for your walk with God it's necessary in order to understand I'm sorry to study and understand the rest of pardon me the revelation so it's absolutely necessary can anybody say amen to that four out of the ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets and now the trumpets come the vials like the first burst of a roman candle so roman candles like a big long cylinder like a pop can shape and they have all these balls in here right and it shoots out one first but there's more balls left in there then another than another and it keeps going so all the balls are gone all those little fireballs right well that's what he's saying that the the book of Revelation is it's like that first blast of fire is the church ages then the seals the trumpets then the vials it just keeps blowing out more power more light of God and so we can't get the other lights until we get the first light does everyone understand that that's his illustration you can't get the other understandings unless you understand the church ages first this is what the Prophet wrote he says like the first verse of Roman can of the church age has come forth with the mighty initial illumination which without which there could be no further light so according the prophet of God you can't even understand the seals the trumpets or the vowels without first being illuminated to see the truth of the seven church ages how many believe that you believe that that's pretty powerful that's pretty and to me it makes sense oh now I see why the Holy Spirit led me to the church age book the very first book I read after I got saved hallelujah why why would he do that because in order for me to understand the rest of the book I had to have the foundational piece amen now he says this but once the brilliance is that what you would call these 43 sermons I hope so because they're not my thought they're God's thought but the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the revelation opens wider before our wandering eyes and we and I hope this is how you feel we edified and purified by the Spirit by its Spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our Lord and Savior the one true God Jesus Christ do you like that my high I thought all right I've got to put that in there the people have to know these 43 sermons have not been in vain without this illumination you'll never be illuminated afterwards right you have to have that this makes ready this makes you ready for the rapture think about it as we looked at these think about the battles well let me go back here let me go back to that slide here that's number 15 let me go back to this one look at this if you don't understand the battles that you're facing so if you try to go right to the seals but yet you don't understand the deeds of Nicolaitans you don't understand the synagogue of satan' the false doctrine of balaam and nickel aid and doctrines and Jezebel the false spirit and living a name but you're dead if you don't understand these and have these revelations like what about Ephesus and having your first love if you lose your first love you're not even gonna care about the seven seals because you don't love you're not alone with Christ anymore you understand so see how it's so important to understand the seven churches it's so crucial right like you know sometimes you know people might say well well I know the white horse rider was the lying spear well how does that affect me it affects you in a great way because if you know if you are able to discern every lie Satan tells you then the white horse riders already wrote into your life you understand if you accept any lie from Satan the white horse rider has written into your life and he's conquering you does everyone understand by God's grace it's so crucial that's kind of hot in herre mouth God you and turn on the air it's kind of a Zen ebuddy else hot yeah I'm okay all right I got some hands there okay so I know that wasn't just me but I hope everybody understands that these are real battles right the white deception and then the killing of influence or killing of physical bodies that was Roman Catholic Church and the the kingdom building here with the scales kept getting money it's a money system and then spiritual death spiritual death it's so important what is the white horse mean what does the red horse mean to me it means a lot to you are you killing anybody's influence are you accepting any live from the enemy well you're allowed to do this and you're allowed to do that when the Bible says you shouldn't it's so important to understand these things we have to know how Satan works and to me that's not a minor thing to me like what the Prophet said that's a necessity it's a necessity that we understand the church ages it's an absolute necessity we need it by God's grace now here's what I said here's what I picked up remember the scripture but growing grace and knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ if you have around the church age book you really need to do it it's a necessity you will grow so much in your walk with God as I've read through it I've know I've grown grown I've missed things I forgot about things there's been things I've read in there that made me cry by that that brought me closer to Christ that made me repent of this and that because it's brought me it's brought me more illumination praise God I'm going from light to light from glory to glory from faith to faith praise God absolutely and then remember we must be overcomers we must overcome he that overcometh inherits all things we have to overcome the Laodicean spirit and we inherit all the other things ruling nations right the Morningstar the Tree of Life if we in overcoming our age God will reward us with everything else so we must not take that lightly we can't take it lightly because we live in America life so easy you know all these things there's no real persecution we must stay on top of our spiritual discernment' amen we must not drop off we must not get it well I've heard enough of the word or I know enough about God you don't if you think that you don't know enough about God because he's the inexhaustible fountain of eternal life Amen because they as we said a few months ago or last month he's the unsearchable riches of Christ you can never search it out he could ever get down to the bottom of it we've got to get past of our complacency I'll say like that now here's what he said in 1960 a month before he preached this series in condemnation my representation he said it's a prophetic message and after that first I'll preach it then it goes on tape magnetic tape from that to records and then to be took off by shorthand and then typed in the book the book is gonna go I'm sorry going to be a commentary on the seven church ages and if I didn't think that it was essential and if I didn't think it was badly needed let me say like this church you badly need to read the church age book or at least listen to the sermons because they're very similar there's more in the church age book because they had five years to write or four years to write it but you it is absolutely essential that you listen to those sermons or read that book because there's probably things you missed you know as we've gone through it there's probably things I miss I plan to go back after my family reads the whole Bible by God's grace we're going to the church age book that's gonna be our nightly devotion they will read one scripture and then we'll read maybe a couple pages we haven't talked about it yet but almost through the Bible we're in Ezekiel right now we read through all the New Testament we started Genesis now or zekiel by God's grace uh I can't wait that's gonna be such a milestone for me because I wasn't raised like that and now by God's grace I can say we have raised our children in the fear of God they've heard the whole Bible by the time they're you know thirteen thirteen what a blessing that can be how many want their families like that how many want their children or grandchildren like that am i what greater blessing could we have than have the Word of God written upon their hearts if I didn't think it was essential if I didn't think it was badly needed I certainly wouldn't take the people's time of saying it if I don't think this was necessary I wouldn't take 43 sermons to preach it to you it's absolutely essential because it's prophecy right it's life its victory it's over coming under wisdom and understanding it's all these things that the Holy Ghost is trying to lead us and guide us into there understand that but I believe that it may be the last time we'll ever receive it from this church especially now that's interesting thought I'm not gonna go far that's interesting thought so now let's be real prayerfully about it real prayerfully now I went over this a few weeks ago sorry two weeks ago but remember I've drawn a lot of inspiration from this series one of them was church attendance and local ministry because Jesus said our works must be more at the end than they are at the beginning a lot of people were going to retire spiritually well I'm I'm now I don't have to serve God no that's when you got to be more dedicated to God you're also gonna be a Solomon we don't want to be a Solomon who when he got old he back slid and had many wives now for us you can remain married but you could have many idols in your life right you could have many idols your phone could be an idol right money could be an idol we could just name all the idols pride arrogance you know fear you can have many idols and mean I don't worship err devote more of ourselves to Christ as we get older it's gonna cost you but that's what you're supposed to be a living sacrifice that's your reasonable service if your sacrifice died for you well shouldn't you die for him that's just reasonable that's your reasonable service play the playin tapes only movement you know this this really bless my heart they found them to be liars so in other words anybody that changes anything Apostle Paul wrote they're a liar and that was a great revelation to me I read it I read that when I really needed it because I D males coming my way I had face-to-face meetings with people that believe this and by God's grace I was able to stand on the truth of God but see that would that meant a lot to me God was bringing inspiration to me and also this one I think the church would appreciate God hates when Satan convinces the lady they have no ministry that's what the deeds of the Nicolaitans are nikkolon to means conquering the laity so see Church you've got a you and I know I'm the pastor so you're the lady right so so you've got to let yourself not be conquered I've got to make sure I encourage you to have a ministry I've got to make room for your ministry right but Jesus hates when the ladies conquered well you're not holy or you can't get in the spirit we ought to get in the spirit we ought to get so happy about Jesus we shout or scream or cry or something or pray for somebody or do something we ought to be so in the spirit as Satan doesn't conquer you don't let the preacher be the only one who's trying to get in the spirit we all got to get in the spirit that's what we need we've all got to come here pray and I love when people come to pray early that's the key right there that's the key prayer is the key we've got to pray down the blessings of God see these inspirations these are these are things that we need to grow into by God's grace and then receiving the hand of man I love this thought brother Brennan says when we received the message of the hour and all these mysteries that's hidden manna because we're kings and priests and it was the priest who going the holiest of Holies and partake of that original manna and we get to partake of the original apostles doctor in a Amen and then brother Ram said in heaven we'll ask Jesus the questions that no one ever knew why did what happen behind the scenes here or why did this happen or and then as he gives us answers but the RAM said that's our hidden manna in heaven that's what he said and I love this the new name in the white stone the Prophet said is the revelation that God gave you of your name as a Christian he said it's a revelation in you and the Bible said you can't tell anybody your name and brother Branham said that means you can't you can't really share with anybody the revelation that's in your heart it's it's so personal you can't give somebody the oil right the wise can't give the foolish the oil you've just got enough for yourself amen your name is in a white stone your name I'm a Christian it's hidden in a white stone and you can't give it to anybody else just like Jacob Jacob couldn't make anybody walk like him that was a hidden revelation to him praise God he wrestled God he wrestled the angel he overcame just like you overcame you can't tell anybody else you can't make anybody else do it all you can do is testify what God did for you you've got a revelation you've got a new name in a white stone amen glory he said that's why Abram had to be changed to Abraham Sarah - Sarah saw to Paul Simon to Peter they all had to get this revelation that was hidden in the white stone amen I'm glad I got I used to be Jesse the whatever the worldly guy the sports guy now I'm jet brother Jesse the preacher Amen or the godly father of the godly husband or the godly schoolteacher I have a different name and I liked it people about it but they just can't get it because it's just for me only my revelation of who I am in Christ Jesus are you with me see these are all revelations that come out are these are these sermons that are to us they're making us ready for the rapture they're brilliant amen hallelujah they're they're magnificent dins and these are some of them that these are the first ones I thought of I have to go back and listen to him you know to get all of them and this is the last one I had Jesus told the submerging church age I know your sufferings and this really encouraged me because brother BAM said Jesus knows our sufferings and the way we prove our love to God is by just carrying ourselves with joy in the midst of our trials that's how you can prove that you love God God I believe you I'll walk through this trial as hard as it may be I'll still love you because I know you died for me I know I'll never suffer like you did you suffered more than any other man could ever suffer for me and because of that I'll trust you that you allowed this to happen I love you and I'll have joy I'll go to church and I'll be happy instead of being sad amen I'll get on my knees and I'll give you praise instead of feeling sorry for myself all God help us be Christians like that to know that Jesus knows what we're going through he's allowed it and we can trust him now one more and then we'll move on to the back to the key of David here I haven't actually got to it but I wanted to lay this foundation now remember the prophet of God I'm gonna skip all this but brother Branham said he would preach the sermons to get inspiration we went over a few weeks ago we come here to be inspired amen we should be inspired when we leave here it's just one diff not many things at least one thing you ought to say God give me one thing that will inspire me to live a better Christian life tomorrow amen you ought to by God's grace now here's what he says he says and I believe it ought to make a striking little commentary on the church age have you ever been struck by anything good preached these last forty three sermons I hope you've been struck by something by God's grace but he said it ought to be a striking little commentary on the book of Revelation the church ageist Amen is that is that okay by God's grace to be understanding okay remember it's absolutely necessary it's absolutely necessary to sit here this preaching and not just hear it but receive it receive it that's why I want to preach on Sunday so I give you I want to preach on that thought I want to tile it let that quote from the church age book I don't have it on my mind right now but maybe I can pull it up but I want to title it you can never overemphasize the power of Revelation something along those lines you can not over I can never overemphasize the importance of Revelation think about it and I guess I'll just get into the sermon little bit if you read the Old Testament what do they always start with the word of the Lord came to Jonah the word Lord came to Micah the word Lord came to Habakkuk so what was what was all these books written about they're written about through the revelation of the Holy Spirit we wouldn't have a Bible unless the Holy Spirit gave us revelation gave some man revelation he wrote it down and gave us the Bible you can never overemphasize how important is for you and I to receive a revelation and I just went through those revelations that lead to me these are revelations these were revelations I just said for I said 5 that I could quickly pull off a few weeks ago and and think about and it's because of them it's because of Revelation that I overcome the gates of Hell pori Amen that's right jesus said with the revelation of me as Messiah you the gates of Hell cannot prevail against you how can Satan defeat me if I've got the revelation that Jesus Christ is inside of me amen how can I be I can't meet and that's why I'm standing today glory that's why you're standing today if you got the revelation that Jesus Christ is the son of God he's alive and well today then the gates of hell don't prevail against you either it's exactly right Church exactly right that's how I can stand as I said before I know how I used to live I know all my habits I used to have all my addictions and I know how I'm living now Satan knows how I live right now glory those demons know how I live right now I'm not a hypocrite if I make a mistake I say I'm sorry I'm not a dick all these things like all that you know other people might be I'm living the life I know where I stand I'm serving Christ with all my god amen I know the gates of Hell don't prevail against me I know Christ prevails over the gates of Hell amen we ought to know that we ought to know where say we got to know these things by God's grace it's exactly right now let's look at the key of David sorry I just want to put that in there amen hallelujah thank you Jesus a joy it's it's a joy unspeakable and full of glory for glory full of glory it is joy on speakable and full of glory and the half has never yet been told I found the pleasure I once craved it is joy and peace within that's why I'm offering to Jacinda and Gemara tonight there's nothing ever get peace and joy to you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior that's when joy and peace comes in when I first received not wept like a baby and I've been happy ever since I've had my trials God my wife knows I've had trials but I'm happy in my soul amen now let's get the key of David here and I wanted like I said I want to end with a salvation visual I got some visuals because I've been showing the children of school just a visual way to salvation it's been really really wonderful okay so the key of David now if you got your Bibles we'll just read a few scriptures here the key of David revelation three seven let's go there by the grace of Lord revelation 3 7 now read this for our text here and I'm just looking at one scripture real quick here I was looking up the word veil now what the Bible say darlin I'm gonna ask you a quick question here the Bible didn't say Sara I'm sorry uh Rebekah put a veil over her face did she cover her face when she saw Isaac and when she first met him in the field does anybody remember I was looking for a scripture it's not veil looked up veil unless it's spelled differently but I was looking so I want to show this how the veil was was connected to weddings and I didn't have time to look that up here parmie yeah I did yeah sorry ok well I know it's Genesis 4 24 so I'll just I'll keep my Bible there ok the key of David sorry I thought it was the word veil he that hath the key of David this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding verse he that is true Christ is the perfect realization and he's contrasted that means he's different than the partial realization this is what I showed on Sunday I thought it'd be good for jamai Rijn and Justin if they never seen this before in the Old Testament they had a partial reality of God so in other words God wasn't really he wasn't as real to them as he is today in the New Testament so in the Old Testament they would they had natural bread they read and they get they sacrificed bread to God or at least said in the temple but Jesus in the New Testament is true bread and Jesus said if you eat of me you'll never be hungry again in other words you wanted to go out in the world and say oh I want to do some things in the world you'll be satisfied with the Word of God so that was partial Old Testament was partial New Testament Jesus Christ is the true bread you'll never be hungry again if you partake of Christ in the Old Testament they had wine they sacrificed wine I'm sorry - vine sorry they had a vine that a partial vine or a partial understanding of God as a vine but jesus said I am the true vine in other words he said you're truly connected to heaven he said I'm the vine you're the branches so we are truly connected to Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit he's the true vine we have a true connection and if we're truly connected we produce true fruits which are love joy peace long-suffering gentleness kindness godliness in the old testament sin could only be covered over it could just be covered over but in the New Testament it's totally done away with and Jesus forgets our sin it's so it's just not even there anymore that's the New Testament in the Old Testament they would sacrifice and go to church and they would leave and they still have the same desires I still want to cuss I still want to fornicate I still want to steal I still want to be rich all but in the New Testament he takes that desire completely away my flesh wants to smoke my flesh wants to drink but this guy never wants to do it the inside of me once that never wants to do it the outside is still gets tempted but this guy never lets it happen because he's in control now Christ is living in me now and he's in control of me now so he don't let it happen because he don't desire those things anymore yes Moses was a lawgiver in the Old Testament but Jesus gave us the true law he gave us the New Testament the new word the new promise David was a prophet in Old Testament as we'll get to he was a prophet King but Jesus is a true prophet and he's king of kings and Lord of lords they had a they had synagogues where they felt God was that but many times God wasn't there but in the New Testament this is the church really is in a building the church is the believers by the Holy Ghost so when God dwells in you you're part of the church we say like tonight well we're going to go to church but really wherever we gathered if we would want to brother amens apartment then we would had a church there because that's the real church right it's not just a building the buildings of the church it's those who are filled with Christ they're the church and not only the church they're called the body of Christ they are Christ's body on this earth okay so that gives you an idea the key of David comes from that idea the partial reality versus the perfect reality now David was a man for God's own heart was king of Israel but Jesus is the greater David king of kings and Lord of lords god Barry God now David was born of the tribe of Judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the shewbread reserved for priests he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king he sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of Christ now here's where we get the scripture the key of David I don't know if you ever seen this before but it's Isaiah 22 22 so you don't return it like I said I'm trying to get somewhere I'm just gonna show slides if I want you look it up usually I put a little note on there to read this and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder now this was written by Isaiah who lived after David right so this wasn't speaking of David himself it wasn't speaking of a physical key it was the spiritual key of the key of the house of David when I lay on his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open so look at the Prophet says the Spirit the Holy Spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church this is about the church Isaiah is writing about the New Testament church what the key of David signified at that time is mere shadow which is I want to emphasize that is now fulfilled do you know that the scripture is now fulfilled amen it's now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands in Revelation chapters one two and three it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage so I just put a little picture up here the key of David is fulfilled as Jesus stands in the midst of the lamp stands can never understand that if you've been around you understand it each each branch represented the church with its messenger then Christ is standing in the midst of the seven Church ages so the key of David with the government on his shoulder is fulfilled after Jesus ascended and he's in heaven that's when the key of David is fulfilled can the church say Amen so they're a sign oh okay this is where the key of David's will fill right here now don't get me wrong there is a future key of David for the millennium I know that we'll get to that in a minute but it's also fulfilled right now as well it's a field right now and here's why what does the key signify let me get there here okay all right there we go yeah Vail was spelled V ail okay just so you know forgive me I was trying ve il anyways what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it so we know it's not in his hand it's not his pocket the key is on his shoulder okay read Isaiah 9:6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east so government upon his shoulder meaning comes from a wedding ceremony when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility and they care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of David I knew ya so if you got your Bibles going to Genesis 24 verse 65 and this is scriptural because here Rebecca is getting married and she sees her bridegroom so what does she do she covers her face with a veil hallelujah Jer I'm sorry not you Genesis 24 65 forgive me no all right who'd like to read that for me 24 65 all right Lydia thanks Lydia okay so Rebecca is just about ready to marry Isaac so she knows that's her husband future husband so she says oh give me that veil I got to put the veil on right so everybody knows that's what that's why Christian women today ought to wear a veil down the aisle right because they're coming to the state I have no head you're my head right that's right that woman's supposed to say hey I have no leadership the God's gonna lead me through you don't like that so much worldly women don't like that they don't want to wear a veil but that's what it means it means I have no head anymore I'm coming to my head and guess who Explorer escorts are down daddy daddy was her head before right but now daddy's bringing her to her new head her husband praise the Lord and this is what Rebecca did Rebecca was coming to her bridegroom so she covers her head with the veil I said Isaac I I've no more head you're my leader I'm trusting God to lead you and I'm gonna follow you all the days of your life now look at verse 66 and the servant told Isaac all the things that he'd done and Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was comfort after his mother's death so this scripture doesn't give us the the actual picture of Vail on the shoulder I couldn't find any when I looked but this is the closest one we have she has to put a veil on goes into the tent and we know they have relations they they consummate the wedding so at some point he would had to take off the veil right and then from this reference the Prophet and leave ale knew that Jewish Jewish people had to take off the woman I'd take off the veil and set out on her shoulder when Simon got married that's what he did with sister Beth was anybody there here I think I wasn't the only one that was there my wife and I so Simon took off best veil and put it on Simon's shoulders Simon walked down the aisle with that veil on his shoulder I thought glory that's the key of David amen because the government the responsibility is on his shoulders and that is Christ and the church so Jesus is telling the church listen I'm taking responsibility for you I'm putting my responsibility for you it's all my shoulders I'm gonna take care of it you have nothing to fear you're my wife you haven't denied my name you're my wife and I'm gonna take full responsibility for your life it's exactly right no one has any other power no man has any right to tell you what to do only I'm gonna tell you what to do now we got to be make sure we have to make sure we only listen to Christ right have to make sure we silence any voice that goes against the Word of God and we only obey the Word of God that proves were the real Bride of Christ because he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches God being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone don't you love that I'm I belong to Jesus I am all Jesus's I don't belong nothin to this world amen glory she is wholly committed I like that wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ as the head of his church as Sara called Abraham rule or even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord I hope my wife is happy I'm her husband tonight I believe she is but that's a true marriage right all the wives here are happy that God gave you the right husband you ought to be right because that's what Christ is the church we're so happy Jesus is our husband I'm glad the devil ain't my husband I'm glad Christ as my husband amen because he takes full responsibility he chose me anyway and I just walk in his past amen as Sarah called Abraham Lord even she's happy let's read that let's go to first Peter 3 I want to read that once I put it in yellow Jesus speaks and the bride obeys for that is her delight now see if and if I'm a true preacher and I preached Jesus's words you ought to be happy leaving Church many times because it's not what I'm telling you it's what Christ told you already right so you should delight in the preaching of the word if the word says this well I'm happy to do that I'm happy to obey my husband I'm happy to take orders from the God of heaven because I trust the God of heaven 1st Peter 3:1 we would like to read verses 1 and 2 for me bruh Adam thank you sir amen we'll stop right there now this scripture says right here that if a man is wrong in a woman's right in a marriage and the woman is not supposed to use the word she's supposed to use the power of the Holy Ghost inside of her she's not supposed to preach at the man she's supposed to live the life in front of the man so if the man's making bad financial decisions she doesn't take her Bible and say look what the Bible says you know you're supposed to there she's supposed to just pray for him and and when that topic comes maybe she just be silent sometimes silence is more powerful than anything you could say just being the humble just bow on your head and maybe praying or just looking at the person you know look at them in the eyes be what they're you know with the look on your face she's not to preach the word but let me let me show you the balance so remember we preach it a few well we preach - this summer brother branham's wife said aren't you ashamed of yourself to say that God hasn't called you to the ministry she didn't preach one scripture does ever understand that cuz I don't want the wives to go home and rebuke their husbands tonight unless they need it so you understand what I'm saying she didn't take the scripture she just said aren't you ashamed to say that God hasn't called you to be a preacher and brother BAM said I was glad she rebuked me and I let me say like this there were some in time many times I made a mistake and I'm glad my wife asked me about it I'm just being honest my wife's never preached to me so I'm very thankful for that but she has asked me about that well is that exactly right or can we talk about this or what do you think about this and I'm very grateful for that very grateful because I'm not perfect so Adam read that it's very important for a woman not to preach it the husband but just to live a godly life and just to let the life of Christ another in other words let me say like this if a man's wrong he's got a evil spirit on him you can ever say amen to that if he's made mistakes then he's got an evil spirit on him he hasn't repented of it and the wife doesn't want to get an evil spirit on her so she's got to keep the right spirit on her and not become a preacher you understand that that's what we have to remember if someone's making a wrong decision well if the man he's got a wrong spirit on him maybe it's lust maybe it's greed like we talked about maybe it's selfishness maybe it's pride but she can't let a wrong spirit get on her she's got to keep the right spirit on her and that takes that takes a lot of Holy Ghost it takes a lot of diligence but brother Graham said my wife is my correction did you know he said that my wife is my correction I love that I just love how baron was so honest with us now stop right there now verse three I'll read that now who's this is helping our sisters well with what to wear watch this verse three whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair now I looked at up that don't mean that don't mean any braid that means an expensive hairdo braid now hairdo is not the word but it means an expensive braid in other words in other words if one of these sisters went to the most expensive salon in New York and said give me that brain just like Beyonce I can but a woman who's poor but loves God and braids her hair is that demonic absolutely not she's just braiding her hair so if you look it up that's what the history is look at the context of this this is dealing with money and wasting your money everybody's got to wear clothes it's not a sin to wear jewelry Jesus told the story the prodigal son he said put a ring on that man why would Jesus tell him to put a ring on if wearing a ring was sinful a lot of churches have church twists because of jewelry well you should wear jewelry but jesus said put a ring on his finger so obviously jury's not wrong not all jury's wrong no some is if I bought a 20 to $20,000 ring yes that's wrong I want to put that to the kingdom of God what this this was $99 at Walmart when I think I've been 59 actually now I think about it back in 19 or 2003 when I bought it it's not about the money it's about the commitment behind the jewelry for the RAM said if you want to wear a necklace for your husband do that it's about the commitment behind that necklace I'm fully committed I fully love my husband I'm committed to my husband and there's nothing wrong with a woman want to look pretty she's made to be pretty she's way prettier than a man if the man's pretty something's wrong with that man it's true it's true he all pretties himself up paints his face or whatever you know it's wrong it's the wrong spirit he's supposed to be clean I've got try to come to church clean you know if I don't comb my hair and put gel in my hair it just straight stick straight up and it looks awful that's why I put gel my hair I'm not trying to be pretty it just looks ugly if I don't and I can't shave it because my wife don't want my hair shaved so you understand what I'm saying like I I don't do this because I'm trying to be pretty I'm just trying to look clean you understand I'm just trying to please my wife you know she wants me to look nice to her I think I look pretty good with the shaved head but my wife doesn't think so you understand like I'm trying to here trying to get you understand braiding the hair is not demonic but spending twenty thousand on it is a very prideful act and it's selfish how many poor people could you feed with twenty thousand dollars you understand how many preachers could you send to Thailand or Japan with twenty thousand dollars people that are hungry for the gospel and you spending on a necklace shame on that that's just wrong never understand he if you look it up it's not just braiding hair it's expensive braids like we say celebrities let let the woman's door outward adorning of plaiting the hair and a wearing of gold seeing a putting on apparel don't worry so much about gold and your fancy clothes but what does God interested look at verse for God is interesting this in the hit but I'm sorry but let it be the hidden man of the heart God wants gold in your soul God wants Christianity in your heart that's what's beautiful to God that's the fancy hairdo not the fancy jewelry think I don't care about that I don't want you with the nicest clothes it don't matter what the clothes are yeah yeah I'm have modest clothes but God wants somebody who's really genuine and beautiful on the inside amen that's why our women don't have to like I said paint their faces and wear makeup that's why our women don't have to spend all this money on different things and plastic surgeries everything like that God's not interested in the outward God's interested on the inward what's your heart like are you really loving your husband I really loving your children are you really loving your neighbor or do you got evil sin in your heart God when somebody was beautiful in the heart hallelujah because the Bible says it next hallelujah and that which is not corruptible see gold will corrupt your clothes will get old God doesn't care about that even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God great price great price God God gets God is cheerful God rejoices when we have meek sisters and we have loving husbands amen when we have meek sisters that can can follow other husband's desires and follow the teaching the church God loves meet women like that and God loves a man that will love his family he'll treat his wife like he treats himself God loves a man like that and that's very valuable in the sight of God or valuable than any mega church or any building any building fun of ten million dollars how could you build a ten million dollar church when you know Christ is coming like brother Rams and how could you do that I don't know I've never in that situation but are in other words our outward appearance shows what's on in our heart verse five for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection their own husbands so that's the real clothing that's the real appearance God's want you to have so for our sisters is to obey their husbands and for the men to really love their wives no real man will treat a woman in a bad way if he does he's not a real man there's no man inside of him if he won't if you don't treat a woman the right way and the church said he's not even a man he's a beast he's nobody no he's no more of a man than the monkey down at the zoo the chimpanzee because he's a beast he acts like a beast he won't even treat a daughter of God the right way he's not even a man yet to get saved look at verse six even as Sara obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement now the brothers will shout Amen at different churches hallelujah my wife needs to call me Lord well are you doing the next verse brothers likewise so see just the same brothers well my wife should respect me more she should listen to me well let's see if you're doing the likewise likewise she husband's dwell with them according to knowledge now knowledge means a deep understanding of Christianity so a man has to have a deep understanding of how a Christian woman needs to be treated she's not a doormat she's not any less than him as far as in God's eyes she just has a different role that's under his role she's no less she's just as valuable she still where 10,000 world's just like a man soul is hey man hallelujah giving honor so see a man is supposed to honor his wife not disrespect her like I said if he does that he's not a real man and to me he don't have the Holy Ghost if he does that if a man disrespects his wife he don't have the Holy Ghost because a woman who cuts her hair disrespects her husband and she don't have the Holy Ghost and it's likewise now that's just my opinion I don't have any quotes on that but that's just my opinion and I believe it's scriptural because right here it's I believe in Scripture as unto the weaker vessel so she's weaker physically and as being heirs together the grace of life so see they inherit the same rewards that your prayers not be hindered and a man will not answer God's prayers I'm sorry I meant God will not answer man's prayers if he's not treating his wife the right way now let me close I think I got what I got it close because I'm getting let me see how many sides I got well I'll just go let me go fast cuz these I kinda want to get the key of David thought finish let me just read you these but have men heated this truth and this is the truth he's talking about the truth that that Jesus has the responsibility for the church and brother Rams gonna show now how no most churches the the preachers take control the church now we're suppose to have preachers but the preachers are supposed to preach Christ's word not their own word Christ's word see they have esteem his person or have they esteem his person who alone has the full sovereign authority of his church I say no and let me say like this if I have offended somebody or I've done something wrong then you have a right in one month to vote me out so let me know if I need to pack my bags though alright let me know but if I've done wrong that's why God set it up that way every year they can vote you out if I'm not if I'm if I'm mistreating the church if I'm if I'm taking respond trying to control the people and get them away from the Word of God then you got a right to get somebody in here who will handle you the right way and let Christ take the responsibility that's why I love God's system praise God for an every Church age in every age the church has been governed by a hierarchy a priesthood an apostolic succession see closing the door mercy and grace to whom it will and instead of assuming the love and responsibility Church it has with mercenary lust preyed upon her and destroyed her the clergy lived in luxury while the poor Church fed on the husks of abuse and not one age did any different so see most churches don't let Christ have the authority of the church they take control of it right that's exactly right and I was encouraged you know everybody wrote that pastor appreciation card for me and one of the comments in there was brother Jesse god bless you he said your they said you're a true pastor you care for all the sheep and I thought thank you lord I don't have favorites like oh I just spend time with Naomi's family or her I just go to Adams house which I haven't meant his house you notice that I'm saying but if I hear somebody has a need I want to try to help you out I tried I want to help out everybody and I'm trying not to live in luxury when I first got my first job I signed my first contract for I think it was $29,000 and that was before taxes I've worked my way up for 14 years I've tried to earn as much money as I can to buy that van and I went into debt big time to get that van but I want a safe vehicle to bring my children to the house of God every Sunday and every Wednesday and I've done that by God's grace for 11 years that's my reason I want that the last as long as I can you know I drove that other Kia van I'm just trying to tell you I'm out living in luxury I agree that a Kia van until it couldn't go anymore until the gas tank was leaking it was gonna fall off I drove it out as long as I could because I didn't want to spend my I try to give everything back to the church try to get everything back to the church to keep guest preachers coming in here to keep the lights on to keep the air on to keep the heat on it has to be done like that I'm not trying to live in luxury I'm trying to help the people if I ever need I want to know about it so I can help you out each bound itself to organization and put the government upon men and commit the church to that government there let the people rise up and they were butyl Issa pressed I'm sorry brutally pursue suppress or cast out every denomination has the same spirit so soon I was getting the denominational spirit so we're either we're either going to be under the responsibility of Christ or we're gonna be in the responsibility of a denominational spirit one of the other and it's your vote that does it right you either allow it you allow us to be governed by Christ or you allow us to be governed by denominational spirit can embrace amen your vote proves it if somebody's not right if bang doesn't right now banging are the only officers if we don't meet the office you better vote us out because it's denominational if not is ever understand you got one month to pray about that by God's grace he says every denomination has the same spirit every denomination swears it as the key to the government Church every denomination claims it opens the door but that is not true it is Jesus and Jesus alone he sets the members in the body he endowed them with their ministries praise God I never thought I'd be a preacher Christ gave me that ministry amen he puts the gifts at her disposal so see the gifts are available but we've got a sacrifice if you want a gift you've got to pray about your gift you've got a sacrifice at your gift how many know that by God's grace that's how you develop a gift you sacrifice and put time into it he cares for her and guides her she is his sole property and he has no other but her glory what a far cry from reality is this church age Philadelphia in which we live I'm sorry no not he's going to let her see you forgive me and one day soon these men that even now purport to speak for the church will be rising up in the ecumenical move to place a living Antichrist at the head of their organization which deposes the Lord and we'll find him Christ outside the church saying behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup word with him and he with me but let me say this our Lord has not defeated men claim to open the door to God and shut the door but they're liars all the father has given me will come to me amen and he that cometh to Christ and no wise will be cast out he will lose none of them amen that's so encourages me because sometimes you know as a preacher I preached my heart out and people don't get saved no we had visitors Sunday and but the atom I was praying and I didn't eat that whole day hoping your mom would come to the altar you know you know how it is and you do the same you were up here at the same altar brother and sometimes I get discouraged like well maybe it was me but I have confidence here Jesus will lose none of his children amen I've just got to be faithful I just got to be a faithful seed sower it's up to God God gives you increase amen I just must plant in water and God will bring every soul to this altar that will come to this altar amen I can't beat myself up and let the devil beat me up you know I've got to stand there and say shut up devil get behind me I'm just a planter in water of this seed God will give the increase in God's season he'll do it amen it the last selected member to the body of Christ comes in then will our Lord appear this is the last quote than we'll do this quick presentation on salvation the key of David was that David the king of Israel all Israel all twelve tribes and is not jesus the son of David according to the fact that he will sit upon the throne of David in the millennium and reign and rule over his heritage surely so the key of David signifies that is Jesus who will bring in the Millennium so see he's got that he's got that veil of the bride on his shoulder he's gonna take care of us and he's gonna bring us in to the honeymoon a thousand-year honeymoon amen after the marriage supper he's gonna have that veil on he's gonna bring us into the honeymoon he who has the keys to death and he'll will raise up his own that they might share in his reign of righteousness upon the earth let's stand to our feet I want to present salvation the open door now I know this is the denominational thought so bear with me but I think there's a lot of truth in this so just watch this video here the children we we are buying these for the children at the Bible club so and church we're doing it so they can understand what the gospel is okay so this is all it is it's just a cube it's kind of like a Rubik's Cube but for someone who's never understood the gospel they have these seven pictures and I'm gonna go through each one slowly now I have all the words here so I've been teaching the kids it's like the last month about the plan of salvation this has seven pictures I teach what salvation is that's the tomb that's the rock where Jesus was his body was laid behind the tomb it's just a nice little visual for children they can understand the gospel then Jesus raised from the dead he came out of the tomb and now the cross so Jesus Christ believing in that is the bridge to eternal life and now you have to make a decision are you gonna accept Jesus's offer and go to heaven or you gonna reject him and go to hell and then if you accept him then your life is you're a new heart fill with the Holy Ghost you're gonna pray read your Bible go to church and take the gospel around the world let's go through those real slowly my god you like that by God's grace you know some people are really hard against denomination but I'm against the spirit but this can be a tool to teach children about God so see man is sinful God is holy but the Bible said and so jamya and just so you know and just sin to everyone is born and the Bible said the heart of man is deceitfully wicked above all things that's what Jeremiah says we are born and all of us have wickedness inside of us tomorrow did anybody have to teach you to lie or to steal they might have to teach you know nobody had to teach me either I just came out lying I came out lust and I came out stealing I stole money from my mom no one had to teach me to do that because we're born and sinned we're automatically losing the battle because sins inside of us but God wants us to come to the side of light so what he did he sent his son Jesus Christ and he placed all of your sins you Myron and Jacinda all your sin and my sin was placed upon him and he died so you didn't have to he was killed so you don't have to be killed and then Jesus body was put in the tomb but while his body was in the tomb his spirit his body was placed into him his spirit went to hell and defeated hell and death that's what I love about this picture his body was behind there but his spirit was somewhere else I like to add one more picture to this queue brother Adam maybe we can come up with a new design or something like that I like to see them to see how Christ took the keys of hell because no man could people who had risen from the dead but they always died after that but Jesus rose from the dead and never died again so now he's got the key of death he's got the key to hell because he conquered hell amen so now Jesus with the keys of death and hell he raised from the dead with all power of heaven now he's got all power of heaven power authorities given to me in heaven and earth and now he sends his holy spirit and it's convicting us we must the only bridge we have back to God the only way we get to back to God is through the cross to remember that he forgave our sins so the cross is the bridge to forgiveness and our sins I'm sorry forgiveness of our sins and eternal life that's how we leave from the darkness that first picture and get to the light is through the blood of Jesus Christ and I wish see if I had my way but Adam I put blood all over this cross if I'd my way sister Naomi I that's what I do but that's just me I put because because it's the blood of Christ that takes us there amen it's the life in that blood the Holy Spirit and then you have to decide are you gonna repent accept God's help to come out of that pit of hell are you accept god set up to stop lying and stealing and lusting and cheating and cussing and doing evil and watching evil movies are you gonna accept his help and let him pull you up out of that pit or are you gonna remain in that pit it's your choice will you repent and follow Christ or reject him it's your choice and then if you do accept and he'll fill your heart with the Holy Ghost you have a brand new heart and faithful followers will pray because praying is talking to God and that's where God talks to you also through preaching but that's a personal prayer that he talks to you that that's really really important praying once you have the Holy Ghost you give your life to prayer you got to study and learn more about his word got to go to church and that fellowship you can't love God without loving his people I like how that's a black hand and a white hand like that because Christian doesn't care about your color of skin it just cares about your heart what is in your heart that hidden man is the real Christian right that's what's valuable God that inside your heart what's inside your heart what's inside your heart that's what God cares about and then you'll go to church you'll have fellowship with all the saints I love that we have Asians here black here I'm Spanish half and what else do we got here what else am I missing anything well Jose yeah Spanish Mexican okay we got like a whole mix right here in the Akron Ohio I love it I love that a man I'm so thankful because every every culture has something special about them God made them special a certain way and I love that about everybody I love that we have everything here like the International Church in Akron and then Christians aren't satisfied with just Akron they send preachers to Thailand they send preachers around the world because they want cry they want people in other countries who don't have the privilege to worship like we do they want they want to see them receive Christ okay so does that help Jamar does that help was that was that good just sin does that help a little bit okay and if you won't wear those cubes I'll buy one for you and it's just nice it's a good way to show just simply explain it so nobody can come here and say we don't preach the cross we preach the cross that's all we have is the cross this bar has a word of Prayer here Heavenly Father were thankful Lord God for the plan of salvation Lord God for the open door to us which we know in your scripture you get open the door to the Gentiles in order to even this age you're knocking as we read you are knocking who will come and eat with them who will have a meal with me who will open the door and let me come into their life who will let Christ in their life so I pray for Jacinta and Jumeirah Northcott they're so kind to come here and they have such a good spirit and attitude to come here bless them Lord for coming but I pray for their hearts I pray their hearts will find that bridge to your God and they'll walk across that bloody bridge and they'll be grateful for those sacrifices Jesus Christ and they'll want to grab a hold of that nail-scarred hand and have you pull them up into eternal life Lord for me I've just cried because I'm grateful for that Lord that you've done it to me I'm grateful that after 19 years after I ran from you all those years and did all the evil I could think of that your hand reach down to maintenance thank you Jesus and now I can see on that last picture that's my entire life my heart is in love with you what I'm gonna do is pray read my Bible preach go to church and said the gospel around the world and I'll be happy if that's all my life good system for however many names that have left I'll be happy because I know there's no satisfaction lust and money hilarion the filthy things of the world the temptations that Satan uses to take people to hell I know there's no treasure and then there's no value that I know there's all these value in the name Jesus Christ so I want to thank you over tonight thank you for all the states that have you in their hearts to you as we leave here maybe remember that you have the key of David you have the responsibility of your church to take us over as the southern David into the honeymoon we're know we're getting ready for the wedding in the sky the rapture but because you have the key of David will take us as something into the honeymoons all we want with our lives Lord to be made ready that was not to miss the brilliance of these Church ages turn around if we've been discouraged about knowing character we feel like we're all on may remember tonight that Christ has responsibility over us he's taking care of us and he will not lose one we did not go looking for you Lord you came looking for us we did not choose you you chose us and ordained us that we would go forth and bear much fruit thank you Jesus you know my heart I want to see Adams not on the loose yet this altar I want to see all our minister not to see everyone this all in their father so I just pray help us Lord to be until they come near I wanna see my mother soldier help us
