[0:00] I thought, well, they're going to come.
[0:01] I'd like to play these for them. And our
[0:03] children are new to Brother Ram's
[0:06] message. And so, I'd like them to see
[0:08] how much Brother Ram loved the word of
[0:09] God. How much he emphasized it. Uh
[0:11] because it's the same love that David
[0:13] had for the word of God, right? The same
[0:15] love that Job had for the word of God.
[0:17] All these mighty men of God, we'd say,
[0:19] are humble men of God down through the
[0:21] ages. And the women, of course, how much
[0:23] they love the word of God. And church, I
[0:25] hope it'll inspire you and I to love the
[0:27] word of God more. How many want that
[0:29] tonight? By God's grace. I want to leave
[0:31] here loving God's word more. Hallelujah.
[0:34] Psalm 119:47 and 48.
[0:47] I'll read uh 47 and then we can all read
[0:49] 48 by God's grace. If you're there, say
[0:51] amen.
[0:53] Verse 47. and I will delight myself in
[0:55] thy commandments which I have loved.
[0:58] Let's read 48. Ready? One, two, three.
[1:01] My hands also will I lift up unto thy
[1:04] commandments which I have loved, and I
[1:07] will meditate in thy statutes. May God
[1:10] add the blessing to the ring of his
[1:11] word. You can be seated by God's grace.
[1:14] Case you can switch over here. I'll have
[1:16] some scriptures and slides here. We'll
[1:18] just briefly review. I'm going to try to
[1:20] keep it short here. I want to watch the
[1:21] time and um
[1:25] we want to look again at how prophets
[1:26] love the word of God. Now we covered
[1:28] many Bible verses last week. We went
[1:30] through numerous prophets like Jeremiah,
[1:33] Job, David, many uh St. John was a
[1:36] prophet of course with the book of
[1:38] Revelation and then all these other
[1:39] believers how they love the commandments
[1:41] of God that are recorded in our holy
[1:44] bible. And if they loved all the
[1:45] commandments, uh how much more should we
[1:48] love them because we have the full
[1:49] cannon of the word of God.
[1:52] And then uh God said that he would
[1:53] reward us for eating honey. Imagine that
[1:55] we get a reward for eating the most
[1:57] sweetest thing there could ever be is
[1:59] honey. Praise God. So it's like a double
[2:01] blessing, is it not?
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Right? You feast on the word of God, you
[2:05] enjoy it, right? And then somehow God
[2:07] will bring a blessing about it later on.
[2:09] Hallelujah. And remember the Bible said
[2:11] the blessing, one of the blessings is
[2:13] eating it. And what's the what's the
[2:14] reward? Speaking the word of God, right?
[2:17] He told Ezekiel, "Eat the roll." He told
[2:20] John, "Eat the roll." And when they did,
[2:22] then they would speak the word of God.
[2:24] Hallelujah, church. And there's nothing
[2:25] sweeter than speaking the word of God to
[2:27] somebody. And it's just what they need
[2:29] to hear in due season.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I heard a good testimony
[2:33] from Sunday. You know, I preached on the
[2:34] body of Christ. And and it was told to
[2:36] me that before service, somebody was
[2:37] saying uh about sometimes I feel behind
[2:40] the scenes,
[2:42] right? And remember what I preached on
[2:43] Sunday, the feet are sometimes like
[2:46] behind the scenes. So, it was a real
[2:47] discernment of the Holy Spirit by God's
[2:49] grace. So, I'm thankful for that. Aren't
[2:50] you glad? Hallelujah. Makes me happy as
[2:52] a preacher. You know, I study and pray
[2:54] and watch the word of God and then feel
[2:57] led to say things and write things and
[2:59] then it gets vindicated that I was
[3:00] following the leading of the Lord.
[3:02] That's how I want to live my life. I
[3:03] know you do, too. Praise God. You want
[3:05] God to vindicate your life as well.
[3:07] Amen. So, I'm I'm thankful for those
[3:09] things. And we're, brother Ram said,
[3:11] we're the strongest and healthiest by
[3:13] adhering to, which means obeying the
[3:16] Bible. You'll never be stronger. You'll
[3:18] never be more spiritually healthy than
[3:20] when you're obeying the word. You're
[3:21] saying, "God, I want to obey this today.
[3:24] I don't want to easily fall into sin. I
[3:26] don't want to make plans to sin." Right?
[3:29] The Bible said, "Not make not an
[3:30] occasion for the flesh." Right? So don't
[3:33] plan out sin. Try to fight against sin.
[3:36] And brother Ram said repeatedly, "Every
[3:38] word of the Bible is infallible." He
[3:40] said, "Every word is thus sayeth the
[3:42] Lord and perfect." So we know brother
[3:44] Ram loved the Bible. Praise God. And
[3:48] again, I just love this one from Psalm.
[3:49] Again, this chapter is such a beautiful
[3:51] chapter on the word of God. Therefore, I
[3:52] love thy commandments above gold, above
[3:55] fine gold. Hallelujah. Therefore, I
[3:58] esteem all thy precepts concerning all
[4:01] things to be right, and I hate every
[4:04] false way. So in modern terms, the
[4:06] Bible's right about all things.
[4:09] Hallelujah. So we don't need to
[4:11] necessarily go to chat GTP or Grock or
[4:14] YouTube or Google necessarily. You don't
[4:17] you're not going to get all the right
[4:18] answers there. Sometimes it's helpful.
[4:19] You need to know the weather. But we
[4:22] know if we go to the Bible, it's going
[4:23] to be right every time.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every single time. And
[4:27] remember, we love the word, right? And
[4:29] Jesus loves the word, but Jesus hates
[4:31] the deeds of the nickelans,
[4:33] right?
[4:34] every false way. So again, we we always
[4:37] want to remember Jesus loves us. Jesus
[4:39] loved us. But let's not forget what
[4:41] Jesus hates.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; And I I'm just going to reiterate this
[4:45] quick list. Brother Ram taught us here
[4:47] when brother Ram went back to study
[4:48] church history. But before that, Brother
[4:50] Ram said, "We must prove all things."
[4:52] Let's say all things. Ready? All things.
[4:54] So everything I say, I want to prove it
[4:56] by the word of God.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; And if I'm wrong, will please come help
[5:00] me after service. Praise God. Right?
[5:02] That's what Brother Brham says.
[5:04] uh if it's contrary to my faith and yet
[5:07] the scripture says so, the scriptures
[5:10] right and I'm wrong. And that's the same
[5:13] thing Pastor Smith is saying tonight. If
[5:16] I say something and it's against the
[5:17] scripture, I'm wrong. The Bible's right.
[5:20] Okay? So, you know in advance if you
[5:22] haven't ever heard me say something
[5:24] wrong, you know if I say something
[5:25] wrong, I'm wrong and the Bible's always
[5:28] right. I'm not going to argue against
[5:30] the Bible. I'm not going to add to the
[5:31] Bible. I'm not gonna take anything away
[5:33] from the Bible. My heart, my intention
[5:35] is to to get everything right by the
[5:37] Bible.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; The scriptures always right. And the
[5:43] only way you can do anything is come
[5:45] back to the scripture.
[5:49] Now again, just let's just reiterate
[5:50] real quickly. We'll just take five
[5:52] minutes on the deeds of niceladens.
[5:54] Remember, the Bible tells us, Paul tells
[5:56] us, and I'm sorry, uh John tells us in
[5:58] the book of Revelation, the deeds are
[6:00] the first step away from the Holy Ghost.
[6:02] It's just a deed. It's not a doctrine
[6:04] yet. It's not the doctrine of Balum, and
[6:06] it's not Jezebel religion. It's the
[6:08] first step away. It's just a deed. Well,
[6:10] we just kind of do this sometime. So, in
[6:13] other words, it's like a man-made
[6:14] tradition. You just talk about it. Oh,
[6:17] we just we started this last week or we
[6:18] started last month. Let's try this
[6:20] something new. And it's not really
[6:21] preached yet. It's just something you
[6:23] do. Okay? So, let's remember that. Now,
[6:26] there's numerous uh there's three at
[6:28] least three verses that speak of this in
[6:31] type. You have the four horse riders
[6:33] have the four steps, right? And the
[6:35] deeds are in revelation chapter 2 and
[6:37] three deeds. You have doctrine
[6:38] nicoladen. So, it became more than a
[6:40] deed. It became a doctrine. Then it
[6:41] became the doctrine of balum. Let's
[6:43] bring everybody together. And then it
[6:44] became death. Jezebel religion. Total
[6:47] outright idolatry. Okay. Ezekiel saw in
[6:51] Ezekiel chapter 8. First it was the
[6:52] image, then it was the chambers, then it
[6:54] was the women weeping for tamuz. And
[6:56] then it was the complete utter worship
[6:58] of the sun. Right? Like the Catholic
[7:00] Church worships their their son, right?
[7:02] Their wafer, their circular wafer.
[7:06] And now I'll get into these here uh by
[7:08] God's grace. Now, brother Bam, uh now I
[7:11] got the page number. If you read the
[7:12] church age book, um the first thing that
[7:14] brother saw by history, these preachers
[7:17] there in Rome started forming groups.
[7:19] Well, we're not going to meet with them
[7:21] anymore. And then they started putting
[7:24] clergy in ranks above the other. Well,
[7:26] this pastor is better than that one.
[7:27] That bishop's better than that one. This
[7:29] one here. They started ranking them. And
[7:32] then they started getting extended
[7:33] authority, more than just a local
[7:35] church. So, one pastor started, well, I
[7:37] think I'll just take control of this
[7:38] one, and then I got control of that one.
[7:41] Now, let me balance that out. There are
[7:42] some churches around the world that they
[7:45] don't have a pastor.
[7:47] And so it's better for them to have a
[7:49] pastor who come and visit them from
[7:51] another church and just be the temporary
[7:53] pastor until God raises one up. So I'm
[7:57] not rebuking any any church. Some
[7:59] churches they just don't have preachers.
[8:00] Church, what is it for? It's for a
[8:02] testimony. God either wants them to
[8:04] learn the value of a pastor or God's
[8:06] going to raise up somebody out of there
[8:08] who needs to be a pastor. Hopefully
[8:10] both. Okay, that's that that's the best
[8:12] part because pastors now you see it
[8:14] today. all these evangelists, they have
[8:15] all these satellite churches becoming
[8:16] millionaires and billionaires. That's
[8:19] not the apostolic pattern by God's
[8:21] grace. The pattern is one pastor, one
[8:24] pastor gets the benefit from one
[8:26] sheepfold [snorts]
[8:27] because that's the that's the natural to
[8:29] the spiritual type. Does everybody
[8:30] understand by God's grace?
[8:33] And again, I don't want to spend too
[8:34] much time on this, but just so you know,
[8:35] there are some pastors I know, they
[8:37] pastor more than one church. That's
[8:39] because nobody is raised up to do it.
[8:41] and they pray for someone to raise up.
[8:43] But no man is either gifted or willing.
[8:45] But you got to be both. You got to be
[8:47] willing and you got to be gifted,
[8:50] right? Because the gift will take care
[8:52] of itself. Hallelujah. I've seen that.
[8:54] Every time I'm I'm wondering, I I don't
[8:56] know where to go. The Holy Ghost will
[8:57] anoint me. Give me the words to say, the
[8:59] gift will take care of itself. The gift
[9:00] will back itself up.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then it was apostolic
[9:05] succession. Well, uh, this person knew
[9:07] Peter, so it's got to be this. This one
[9:09] has to be the next pastor, right? And
[9:12] then became, well, this one followed in
[9:14] that line and now we have the Catholic
[9:15] Church, right? And all their popes,
[9:16] right? This is how it started. It was
[9:18] man's idea about apostolic. It was man's
[9:21] succession rather than God's succession.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; Okay? Then it became church membership.
[9:26] Well, as long as you come to our church,
[9:27] you're saved. That's not true. You can
[9:29] come to our church and not be saved.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; This church can't save you. Only the
[9:34] Holy Ghost can save you.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Okay? And then it was a false birth.
[9:38] Stick out your tongue and get the wafer
[9:40] on your tongue. Now you got the
[9:41] anointing. That's not a birth. That's
[9:44] not an anointing. Praise God. What you
[9:46] need to do is let the coal of fire get
[9:48] on your tongue. Amen. There it is. Amen.
[9:50] Hallelujah. I was wondering which
[9:51] scripture was that. Amen. It's Isaiah
[9:52] chapter 6. Amen. Stick out your tongue
[9:55] and start praising God. Amen. Stick out
[9:57] your tongue and start worshiping God.
[9:59] Say, "I love you, Jesus." [screaming]
[10:00] Hallelujah. Praise God. Let the Holy
[10:02] Ghost burn the sin off your lips. Amen.
[10:05] put some praise on those lips. Amen. And
[10:08] then they had a false water baptism and
[10:10] started sprinkling. Well, now they do
[10:11] babies and now it's three backward or
[10:13] three forward or now it's you don't have
[10:15] to be baptized at all. Bunch of
[10:16] nonsense. But they got the false
[10:18] baptism. Then it was they denied the ley
[10:20] God-given right. So in other words that
[10:22] now the ley got to go do they got to go
[10:24] to confession. They don't even have the
[10:26] right to pray to God themselves and
[10:28] confess their sins to God. See they
[10:30] started taking rights away from the
[10:32] people. You don't have a right to say
[10:33] anything about God. It's only me. I'm a
[10:35] preacher. I'm I'm a clergy. I'm a
[10:37] priest. They started taking away the
[10:39] Well, that brother, you can't pray for
[10:41] these brothers. You're not a preacher.
[10:43] Now, you might be, buddy. Well, you
[10:45] know, you sisters, you can't pray for
[10:47] these sick people. You're not preachers.
[10:48] It was demonic. It was separating uh
[10:51] trying to exalt men above other people.
[10:54] That's the first step of the Antichrist
[10:56] spirit. And Jesus hates these. Now,
[10:58] brother, I don't have the page number
[10:59] because I didn't finish this study. But
[11:01] pretty soon, the pope became the vicor
[11:03] of Christ instead of Christ. That's
[11:06] blasphemy. He's not the vicer of Christ.
[11:08] The Bible said we are all man, we are
[11:11] all are children of God. Hallelujah. The
[11:13] Pope did not take the place of Christ.
[11:15] That's what I'm saying. Hallelujah.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; He does not take the place of Christ.
[11:19] Amen. Roman, I'm sorry. Uh uh Martin
[11:22] Luther believed that. John Wickliffe.
[11:24] Amen. John Wesley. Amen. Jonathan Hus,
[11:26] all these holy men of old, they all
[11:28] believe that. We believe that, too.
[11:30] Praise God. I always get fired up when I
[11:32] preach on the Roman Catholic Church.
[11:33] Amen. They got so much wrong. It's easy
[11:35] to get fired up. [laughter]
[11:38] Purgatory. They come up with this idea.
[11:40] You don't go straight to heaven after
[11:41] you get saved. You got to go pay for
[11:43] your sins and then you can go to heaven.
[11:46] That's wrong, too.
[11:48] We pay for them right now. Amen. We get
[11:50] spanked right now. As many as I love, I
[11:53] rebuke and chasen. We get we get our
[11:55] purgatory right now. Brother Ram says we
[11:57] go through our tribulation now. And then
[12:00] mass uh it's making it's making the
[12:02] sacri it's making communion another
[12:04] sacrifice of Calvary. It's sacrificing
[12:07] Jesus over and over again. But the Bible
[12:09] said by one offering
[12:12] not by a continue offering by one
[12:14] offering forever we are perfected by the
[12:17] perfector Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[12:19] Amen. And then pay money to get out of
[12:22] hell. And then the brother gives all the
[12:24] other ones. Now just today, did you see
[12:26] that? The Catholic Church took back
[12:28] their teaching on how Mary is
[12:30] co-redemptric.
[12:33] For over 500 years, the Catholic Church
[12:35] has said, "Mary has a part in your
[12:38] redemption.
[12:40] That's why they call her mother of God."
[12:42] Right? But just today, they resended
[12:44] that church. It's a weak, sad attempt to
[12:46] get the Protestants to shake hands with
[12:48] them and fellowship with them. I'm
[12:50] sorry. We're not going to the uh we're
[12:52] not going to bail porr. We're not going
[12:54] to gather up with Roman Catholics
[12:56] because that's only one lie. They got
[12:58] about 10 million more they got to get
[12:59] rid of. And the church said,
[13:01] &gt;&gt; they're just trying to win people over.
[13:03] They see what's happening after Charlie
[13:05] Kirk and they think there's some revival
[13:06] now. There might be a couple of people
[13:08] in there, but very few will find the
[13:10] road that leads to life. It might shake
[13:12] up some. Now, why you say that, brother
[13:14] Jess? Because the same thing happened at
[13:15] 911. People flocked into churches and
[13:18] what a few months later they flocked
[13:20] right out.
[13:22] The sheep and goats came in, the goats
[13:23] left. I'll say like that. But the same
[13:26] things happened. But one person did come
[13:27] in who was real sa saved. That was Simon
[13:29] Smith.
[13:31] And Simon Smith was my brother. Amen.
[13:33] And Simon Smith brought the message to
[13:35] me and we stayed. Hallelujah. We stayed.
[13:38] AND NOW WE PREACH THE GOSPEL of Jesus
[13:40] Christ. And not just preach it, brother
[13:41] Claw. We try to live it. Hallelujah.
[13:44] We by God's grace with all of our hearts
[13:46] we try to live it. Amen. So with C
[13:49] church we're just trying to live the
[13:51] word of God. Love the word of God. Now
[13:52] I'm just going to read a few quotes just
[13:54] to remind you. Brother Ram called his
[13:55] Bible uh the good oldfashioned Bible.
[13:59] Brother Ram said we have a solid
[14:00] foundation left and that's God's blessed
[14:03] holy word. The Bible. All heavens and
[14:05] earth will pass away but God's word will
[14:07] never pass away. And upon this rock God
[14:09] said I'll build my church and the gates
[14:11] of hell will not prevail against it. So,
[14:13] what a blessed privilege it is to all of
[14:16] us to reach over. Everybody reach over
[14:17] and get your Bible and know and I'm
[14:21] sorry, turn the pages back and know that
[14:23] we're reading directly truth. Let's say
[14:25] directly truth. Ready? Direct. You got
[14:27] directly truth right here. Well, what do
[14:30] I believe? Where do I go? Brother Jesse,
[14:31] what do I do? You got directly truth
[14:33] right here. Pick it up and read it.
[14:36] Praise God. Somebody asked me, they
[14:37] said, "Do you allow uh people to use
[14:39] phones and and Bibles at your church?" I
[14:41] said, "No, I don't. And if you do, I'll
[14:44] walk around. I'll whisper out to church
[14:45] and say, "No, please don't use a phone
[14:47] during church." Now, I do it for prayer
[14:49] requests, right? Or I'm looking up
[14:50] quotes. I use it as a tool. But the
[14:52] reason we don't is because we tried it
[14:54] in past and there's dings in the church.
[14:56] Dings and dings. Rod, I should have
[14:58] known better, but I wasn't raised in
[14:59] holiness, brother. So, forgive me. I
[15:02] wasn't raised in holiness. I didn't know
[15:03] better. But we let somebody try it off
[15:05] years ago at a different church, and
[15:06] it's ding ding ding. and they're trying
[15:08] to tell me they're going to get
[15:09] something out of church while there's
[15:10] ding-ding ding dings going off and
[15:11] you're being distracted from Jesus
[15:13] Christ.
[15:14] Get a book in your hand. Love the Bible.
[15:16] Love the word. Love the communion. Love
[15:18] the fellowship. GET ALONE WITH GOD.
[15:20] HALLELUJAH.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Set the phone down for just a few
[15:23] moments by God's grace and get alone
[15:25] with Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; We're reading directly truth and see
[15:32] that these times happen in days gone by
[15:35] for it speaks of a historical God. And
[15:37] again, I'm not going to read all these,
[15:38] but I love a Bible. Brother Bram says,
[15:39] "The Bible's my textbook." Anybody going
[15:41] to school? I know I got some school guys
[15:44] over here. I tell you, you got a real
[15:46] good textbook by God's grace. Amen.
[15:48] You're going to get all the answers in
[15:50] here to the test. And guess what?
[15:52] There's a test tonight. There's a test
[15:53] tomorrow. Is that right, Brother
[15:54] Patrick? Amen. Is that right, school
[15:56] children? You're going to have a test
[15:58] right now. Hallelujah. Are you going to
[15:59] believe the word or not?
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Let's believe it. Amen. Brother Abraham
[16:04] said, uh, as doctrine, I don't have very
[16:06] much about that. Now, this was young.
[16:08] Earlier in his ministry, by the end, he
[16:10] had a lot of doctrine.
[16:12] I don't know the book too well, but I
[16:14] know the author real well, and that's
[16:15] the main thing. So, people would
[16:17] criticize brother Brandham. He couldn't
[16:18] quote all the scriptures, you know, tell
[16:20] you where to find it. So, brother would
[16:21] just use this humble little saying.
[16:23] Well, I don't I don't know the book too
[16:25] well, but I really know the author real
[16:27] well. [laughter]
[16:28] Glory. Amen. In other words, I can feel
[16:30] the voice of God. can hear the voice of
[16:32] the Holy Spirit. I get the uncction of
[16:34] the Holy Ghost, but I can't remember
[16:35] everything in the word. But I know Jesus
[16:37] Christ, the author, real well.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; How many want to be that way, too? Amen.
[16:42] I tell you, the best case scenario
[16:43] scenario is to know both,
[16:46] right? I want to know both. Really, just
[16:49] like brother Ram said, Brother Ram said,
[16:50] I'd rather have the right spirit
[16:53] uh than the uh and the wrong doctrine.
[16:56] Right. Then have the right doctrine and
[16:58] the wrong spirit.
[17:00] Right. That's true. I'd rather have the
[17:02] right spirit. Another spirit of love and
[17:04] grace and mercy. But at the same time,
[17:06] can't we have both, church?
[17:08] Let's have both tonight. I want the
[17:11] right spirit, the right doctrine.
[17:13] Hallelujah.
[17:14] And I want I I want I want to know the
[17:16] Bible real well. And I want to know
[17:18] Jesus Christ real well, too.
[17:20] I believe that's how we'll get, church.
[17:22] I believe that's how I'm getting. That's
[17:23] how you should be getting, too. You
[17:25] should know the word real well and the
[17:28] author real well, too.
[17:30] In other words, you're not going to let
[17:31] any of those deeds slip in there, right?
[17:34] Because that's the first step away. Now,
[17:36] that's outside of I mean, that's outside
[17:37] of like uh, you know, greed or lust or
[17:40] uh, you know, anger, roots of
[17:41] bitterness. Those are just things that
[17:43] you might see in the church. There's
[17:44] other things, too. Well, we want to stay
[17:46] away from all the deeds of the
[17:48] nickelans.
[17:50] And I love what he says here. I don't
[17:52] preach doctrine. Now, he did later. He
[17:54] said, I don't try to preach doctrine. I
[17:55] let that's up to those who like to do
[17:57] that. I have Christ as my head. The
[17:59] Bible's my textbook and the world's my
[18:01] church. Amen. Now, of course, we knew he
[18:03] preached a lot of doctrine later. He
[18:04] even says that. Now, the Bible is the
[18:06] absolute truth of God. Now, I'm going to
[18:08] skip past this. He just talks about the
[18:10] Old Testament. Uh but as long as it's
[18:12] the word, then I know that heavens and
[18:14] earth will pass away. But this word will
[18:15] never fail. Therefore, I believe the
[18:17] Bible to be the absolute truth of God.
[18:20] And it isn't to be added to or taken
[18:22] away, but just lived preached in its
[18:26] simplicity. live the way it's wrote.
[18:29] Hallelujah.
[18:31] And if God was ever God, he's still God.
[18:33] And if this is his word, he made a
[18:34] promise that he cannot back up, then he
[18:36] isn't God. In other words, God will back
[18:38] up his promises.
[18:40] Hallelujah.
[18:42] So, I want you to see that. Now, this is
[18:44] so important as you'll see. Brother Ram
[18:46] said it maybe hundreds of times. Don't
[18:49] add to the word. Don't take away from
[18:51] the word. Right? Because Jesus Christ
[18:54] said those words, right? We know that in
[18:56] the book of Revelation. Well, I don't
[18:57] know. Those are may may not be red
[18:58] letter words. I don't think so. Maybe
[18:59] they aren't. Anybody know?
[19:03] Okay. They're not. You're right. You're
[19:04] not. They're not. The last red letter
[19:05] words are surely I come quickly. Uh a
[19:08] verse right after that one. But those
[19:09] are those are John's those are John's
[19:12] testimony he got from the angel. But of
[19:13] course, the angel was sent by Jesus
[19:15] Christ. So, pardon me. Brother said,
[19:18] "There's many things I don't know. I'm
[19:20] finite. He's infinite. So the great
[19:22] infinite God and I, a finite man,
[19:24] there's many things that I desire that
[19:26] wouldn't be good for me to have. So I
[19:28] just trust him as my father to give me
[19:30] what's right. Now, this is really
[19:32] important. If anyone's going through
[19:33] struggles right now, this is really
[19:34] important. You can trust an infinite
[19:37] God. He already knew what you're going
[19:39] through right now. Hallelujah.
[19:46] Now, maybe I should have read above
[19:47] that. Some of these I should have read
[19:48] above. I've never seen anything that he
[19:50] promised, but what he would do it.
[19:52] That's right. I've asked him for things
[19:54] I didn't get, but I've never asked him
[19:56] sincerely for anything, but what he gave
[19:58] it to me or told me why he couldn't give
[20:00] it to me. So, church, we may not hear
[20:03] the voice of God. I've never heard a
[20:04] literal voice. I've just felt things
[20:06] here and I felt things drop down from
[20:07] heaven. I felt anointings come down on
[20:08] me, which is wonderful. God speaks to us
[20:11] in different ways. But, uh, the point
[20:13] that we want to make here is that by
[20:15] God's grace, God knows what's best for
[20:18] us.
[20:19] And we can trust God with whatever. And
[20:22] we'll say like this. After bad things
[20:24] happen, just wait a little while, you'll
[20:25] see why it had to happen.
[20:28] God will show you why. And if you just
[20:30] ask God, "Show me why this awful thing
[20:32] happened to me." Or, "Show me why I had
[20:33] to go through discouragement." God will
[20:35] show you why. Hallelujah. Many times,
[20:38] church, I think we go through things and
[20:39] they're actually repercussions of
[20:41] decisions we made, bad decisions that we
[20:44] forgot about.
[20:46] That's happened in my life. I've seen
[20:48] that.
[20:49] And uh you know sometimes church because
[20:51] God's merciful, right? He'll give us a
[20:52] time of repentance and everything like
[20:54] that. Uh and then maybe difficult things
[20:57] will happen,
[20:59] but we got to be able to accept if God's
[21:01] infinite, God knew what you're going
[21:03] through, so he'll still bring you
[21:05] through it. Okay? And if you ask God,
[21:08] ask God, ask God, God loves you. There's
[21:10] got to be a purpose. Maybe he hasn't
[21:12] told you, but he will tell you. Sometime
[21:15] now or later, sometime he will.
[21:17] Remember, throughout the ages, the Bible
[21:19] said he'll be showing you his kindness
[21:20] in every age.
[21:23] I'm talking about the future ages. I'm
[21:24] not talking about while you're alive on
[21:25] this earth. I'm talking about in heaven
[21:27] or we're talking about in the millennium
[21:28] or the future home. The Bible says for
[21:30] ages, he'll show here is my kindness. I
[21:32] was kind to you here. I was kind to you
[21:34] here. God has been extremely good to us.
[21:37] Brother said, "Go to the absolute the
[21:39] Bible." He said, 'D don't take some
[21:41] preachers's word and church, don't don't
[21:42] just just don't just take my word for
[21:44] it, some secretar's word, something
[21:45] else. You Protestants, go to the
[21:48] absolute until you're anchored there by
[21:50] the new birth, being born again and
[21:51] filled with the Holy Ghost, and you see
[21:53] the Bible being manifested in humility
[21:56] and love through your life. Oh, then
[21:59] that's your absolute.
[22:01] Other words, just don't take somebody's
[22:02] word for it. Brother Jesse's preaching
[22:04] about this, but I don't know. Go look if
[22:06] the Bible says it. If the Bible says it,
[22:08] that's your absolute. Amen.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; God will show you in humility that it's
[22:13] right. God will show you in his love
[22:15] it's right. Let's believe the Bible.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother said, "Any promise
[22:20] of the Bible becomes your absolute." If
[22:22] Christ is your absolute, you're tied to
[22:24] him in that manner. No matter what
[22:26] anybody says, how hard the persecution
[22:28] gets, how bad the storm seems to be, how
[22:31] it looks impossible for it to happen, if
[22:33] something has happened to you in that
[22:35] Christ becomes your absolute, or any
[22:37] promise in the Bible becomes your
[22:39] absolute. If you're sick and you're
[22:41] praying for healing or something becomes
[22:43] to that, strikes that promise in the
[22:45] Bible, I've got it. There's nothing
[22:47] going to wave you from it. Amen. So, in
[22:51] the midst of your trial, read your
[22:52] Bible. Open up your Bible. See what God
[22:54] might speak to your heart. See what God
[22:57] might inspire you to believe. And if
[22:58] that seems like it's the Holy Spirit,
[23:00] then hang on to it. God will bring you
[23:02] out of it.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Ram saying, the
[23:05] word. You got to have a promise for the
[23:07] absolute.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to go in your trial.
[23:12] Don't run to YouTube or don't run to
[23:14] Instagram in your trial. Run to the word
[23:17] of God. Hallelujah. Find the absolute.
[23:20] Find what thus sayith the Lord is. Find
[23:22] what the word of God says. Hallelujah.
[23:24] That'll be your answer.
[23:26] My absolute is the word, the Bible.
[23:28] Brother Ram says now, Brother Ram's
[23:30] giving he's answering questions of the
[23:32] deacons on how to handle tongues in uh u
[23:36] December 1963. It's a great message if
[23:39] you haven't listened to it. Now, I'm not
[23:41] trying to ser authority or something
[23:42] like that, but you see a man or anything
[23:44] with two heads, it doesn't know how to
[23:45] go. God never did have two heads to his
[23:48] church. He never did. It's one head. So,
[23:50] he's talking about a pastor. The pastor
[23:53] is the head. And God can't have two
[23:54] leaders. God calls one person to lead.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; And if you don't like it, go find
[23:59] another leader. Right. Right. Any church
[24:02] you're at, if you don't like it, you're
[24:03] you're you're welcome. Just go find
[24:04] another leader. But every sheep should
[24:06] have a pastor. I'm sorry. So, should
[24:08] have a shepherd. Right. Every sheep
[24:10] should have a pastor. That's what
[24:11] brother's saying here. Brother's like,
[24:13] "Well, I'm not trying to I'm not trying
[24:14] to take authority." He said, "But
[24:16] somebody's got to lead around here."
[24:18] Right? That's what I say.
[24:20] Uh, I didn't ask for this. Remember I
[24:21] said I didn't I didn't ask to be a
[24:23] preacher. Even when I was younger, I
[24:24] never thought I'd be a preacher. I
[24:25] didn't ask for this. I feel called for
[24:27] this. And all you husbands, right,
[24:30] someday you're going to be a husband,
[24:31] have a family, you're going to be the
[24:33] head, and then you're going to have to
[24:34] answer for all your decisions,
[24:38] right? The buck stops at you, Brother
[24:40] Brandham says. Right. The buck's got to
[24:43] stop at somebody, right? Somebody's got
[24:45] to make the rules.
[24:47] Hallelujah.
[24:49] So it can't be anybody else. It's got to
[24:51] be one person's got to lead it. So
[24:52] brother, that's what brother's saying.
[24:54] He always dealt in every generation as
[24:56] we study through the scriptures, there's
[24:57] always one individual that he deals with
[24:59] because you get two men, you got two
[25:00] opinions, but it's got to come to one
[25:02] final absolute. And my absolute is the
[25:04] word, the Bible. And as a pastor here in
[25:08] the church, my absolute is the word. And
[25:10] I know you brothers, you kind of look to
[25:12] me to be your absolute. As long, look at
[25:15] that. as long as I follow God. As Paul
[25:17] said, you follow me as I follow Christ.
[25:21] So, brother said, this is a scripture a
[25:22] pastor can take to pe the people, he can
[25:25] say, you follow me. I'm just f trying to
[25:27] follow Christ. But as I said, if I get
[25:30] outside the word, then don't take me.
[25:31] Take the word of God. I'm trying my best
[25:34] to feed the people, shepherd the people.
[25:37] Hallelujah.
[25:40] He says, "And then I'd expect you,
[25:42] brethren, at any time you see me get
[25:44] away from this scripture." What does he
[25:46] say? "Come to me privately
[25:49] and tell me where I'm wrong." Isn't that
[25:51] so humble, church? Now, how many how
[25:53] many uh Sister Beatus, how many pastors
[25:55] in Africa let you come to them and tell
[25:57] them when they're wrong. She's laughing
[26:01] right now, where they come from, not
[26:02] everywhere. I know we've had talks.
[26:04] That's why I'm kind of I'm joking with
[26:05] her. Right? I mean, in other words, some
[26:07] places they know you can't even talk to
[26:08] the pastor. I mean, it's just like
[26:10] nothing. You can't even touch him. But
[26:11] look how brother Ram's even a prophet of
[26:13] God, right? Like a Moses figure or
[26:16] something like a Paul figure. And yet,
[26:19] he's willing if you need to talk to me
[26:20] after church, even the janitor,
[26:24] the go the man or woman who scrubs the
[26:26] toilet. Um, brother Random, I think you
[26:29] got something wrong. Could I correct you
[26:30] on that? Sure, brother. Come on in here.
[26:32] Let's talk about it.
[26:34] But in some nations, you can't do that,
[26:36] can you, Sister Beatatrice? In some
[26:38] nations, you can't do that. They're just
[26:39] untouchable, right? Uh they they're
[26:42] almost like a god, a mini god. That's
[26:45] too bad. It's too bad. Brother said, "I
[26:47] don't care if you're the trustees of the
[26:49] janitor. If you disagree with me, I'm
[26:51] kicking you out of the church." Did I
[26:52] say that? Did I read that the right way?
[26:55] No, I didn't read that the right way,
[26:56] did I? I don't care if you're one of the
[26:58] trustees of the janitor. Whoever you
[27:00] are, your duty mount to me as a brother
[27:02] in Christ to tell me where I'm wrong
[27:03] scripturally. And if there's a question,
[27:05] let's sit down and solve it out
[27:08] together.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; See, face to face is so important. As a
[27:11] church, we've been preaching over the
[27:12] last few months. Matthew 18 is the
[27:14] reality. You got to you got to do that.
[27:16] You got to talk to them. Sit down face
[27:18] to face. That's the pattern brother
[27:19] established. That's what the Bible
[27:21] establishes. Jesus Christ established it
[27:23] first. We know.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; See that? And so brother's love for the
[27:27] Bible, he opened himself. I'll take
[27:29] correction from anybody because I love
[27:31] Jesus and I love the word and I want to
[27:33] be right. If I'm wrong, God help me. I
[27:36] want to be right.
[27:39] Hallelujah.
[27:41] And I love this. I love this series of
[27:42] quotes right here. This is so beautiful
[27:44] because you know, Brother Rod, people
[27:45] are saying today, "Brother Ram's tapes
[27:47] are the absolute or brother Brandham's
[27:49] the absolute." It's complete heresy.
[27:52] It's blasphemy.
[27:53] They're making Brother Ram equal to
[27:55] Jesus or some cases more because they
[27:58] they call brother Ram the greatest
[27:59] prophet ever. And they don't even say
[28:00] except for Jesus. They won't even say
[28:02] that. They're so deceived by the
[28:04] Antichrist deity spirit. That's how
[28:06] deceived these people are. But I love
[28:08] these quotes. I love how Brothers
[28:09] strings it together. There's only one.
[28:12] There's no other. So that takes away
[28:14] anything else. And God's absolute, God's
[28:16] own absolute is his word. I love this. I
[28:20] love this string of quotes. This is so
[28:21] beautiful. Now if he is our absolute
[28:23] there can be no other. You can't have
[28:26] say well my church is my absolute. Eve
[28:28] church we ARE NOT THE ABSOLUTE. BRIDE OF
[28:30] CHRIST FELLOWSHIP IS not the absolute.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Oh that's a good healthy amen. I
[28:34] appreciate that. Brother Jesse Smith is
[28:37] not the absolute.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Oh thank you church. I appreciate that.
[28:40] You've been learning.
[28:42] There's no other ABSOLUTE EXCEPT JESUS
[28:44] CHRIST. HALLELUJAH.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to fail. I'm going TO GET
[28:47] THINGS WRONG. EVERY PREACHER WILL. BUT
[28:49] JESUS CHRIST IS ALWAYS THE TRUTH.
[28:50] HALLELUJAH. HE IS THE WAY, THE TRUTH,
[28:52] and the life.
[28:54] My creed is my absolute. If Christ is
[28:56] your absolute, you believe Christ's
[28:58] word.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; There's no other way to do it.
[29:04] And that's what's the matter in the
[29:06] Christian faith today. We got too many
[29:08] traffic jams.
[29:10] Everybody making their own absolute.
[29:11] Brother, I was talking about overseas.
[29:13] And I've been to South America four
[29:14] times. Brother, they don't pay attention
[29:16] to the lights. When you're driving
[29:18] through the city, it's just the fastest
[29:20] person gets there. And you better slam
[29:22] on your brakes or you're going to get
[29:23] hit. Remember, brother or Yeah, you guys
[29:25] weren't there. Brother Dale told me he
[29:27] got in a huge car accident because
[29:28] that's how it was when he went over to
[29:29] Africa. They They're not going to stop.
[29:32] You either you're either the the head
[29:34] dog or you better hit your brakes. And
[29:37] church, every car has got scuff marks
[29:39] all over it because they get into all
[29:40] these scuffs. I've never seen anything
[29:42] like it. Sister Beers, have you seen it?
[29:43] Is that how they do it down in your
[29:44] city?
[29:47] Not so much. Okay, you're blessed. I've
[29:49] seen it. I I thought I was going to die
[29:51] a number of times. They're just I'm just
[29:54] everybody's zooming by, rushing,
[29:56] honking. So many traffic jams.
[29:59] It's unbelievable. Uh people and people
[30:02] die all the time.
[30:05] But everybody's making their own
[30:06] absolute. We got one absolute and that's
[30:09] the word of the living God.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; That settles it forever. No matter what
[30:14] anybody says,
[30:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[30:17] &gt;&gt; No matter what any man, any woman says,
[30:20] there's only one absolute. That's God's
[30:22] word. It's almost gotten a place like it
[30:25] was in the days of Judges. It is like
[30:26] that today. Everybody has their own
[30:28] absolute. But it all fails like the
[30:31] Pharaohs and so forth. But God's
[30:33] absolute is his word. What does he
[30:34] quote? Heavens and earth will pass away.
[30:36] But God's word will never pass away.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. See, I want these
[30:42] young brothers to see. Patrick and
[30:43] Claude, I want you to see that. You
[30:45] young sisters that just got baptized,
[30:46] Genevie, I want you to see that there's
[30:48] only one absolute. If daddy's wrong,
[30:50] then pray for me. Forgive me, and help
[30:52] daddy to see that the word of God is
[30:54] right. In whatever topic I'm missing it
[30:56] on, it's God's word that's the absolute.
[31:00] God's word is the only thing that
[31:01] changes lives.
[31:03] The Bible says the word is what? life.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; The word is life. You're only going to
[31:08] get life by believing the word of God,
[31:11] eating it like honey, and speaking it
[31:13] out.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; So, we got one. We got one. There's no
[31:20] other. And it's God's absolute is the
[31:22] word.
[31:24] God's absolute is the word. Well, then
[31:26] how can it be tapes? Or how can it be
[31:27] brother Brandham when brother Brandham
[31:29] says, "I'm not infallible."
[31:32] See these tape worshippers, they only
[31:34] select the quotes they want and then
[31:35] they twist those. They forget all about
[31:37] the Bible, brother Rod. They're so
[31:39] deceived. They don't care about the
[31:40] Bible. They care about the quotes of
[31:41] Brother Random. And they twist them like
[31:43] that to their own shame. The Bible says
[31:46] to their own destruction. God's own word
[31:49] is as absolute. Praise God. Amen.
[31:53] I like this quote here. This is a
[31:55] beautiful quote. Check this out here. By
[31:57] God's grace,
[31:59] Abraham's talking about everybody has
[32:00] their own belief in America. But yet,
[32:02] not one jot or tit will pass from the
[32:04] law until every bit's fulfilled. That's
[32:06] every punctuation mark, every little dot
[32:08] on a letter. Every single thing will be
[32:10] fulfilled. And I believe Paul said, "If
[32:12] an angel from heaven would come and
[32:14] teach any other thing than what you've
[32:16] already been taught in this scripture,
[32:17] let him be accursed." Galatians 18, we
[32:19] read it on Sunday. So, I am a
[32:21] fundamental believer in the Bible. What
[32:23] the Bible says, I believe it. and I
[32:25] believe it's a truth and ready to hang
[32:27] my soul on any phase of the Bible or any
[32:31] sentence,
[32:33] whatever it might be that God's word is
[32:36] everlasting truth. It's inspired and
[32:38] written and we stay with it.
[32:42] He talks about the urum thumbum they had
[32:44] in the Old Testament. He said but today
[32:48] he said uh yeah he said but for today
[32:51] the word of God is our yurum and
[32:53] thumbum. So remember the ur thumb was
[32:54] the breastplate the high priest wore.
[32:56] And he went into the ark and if he spoke
[32:58] a word and asked God a question. If it
[33:00] was right, it would light up. The light
[33:02] of the Holy Ghost would reflect off the
[33:04] the the stones. At least according to
[33:06] historians. Doesn't actually say that in
[33:07] the Bible, just so you know. So in other
[33:10] words, they had a way to know what was
[33:11] the word of God. They would go ask God a
[33:14] question. It would shine yes or no.
[33:16] Brother Ram says we've got that today.
[33:19] Aren't you glad church? You got to ur
[33:22] them today. You can go to God in prayer
[33:24] and God will light make something shine
[33:25] on these pages. And not just because you
[33:28] highlighted it, although you might not
[33:31] highlight yours. Hallelujah. He said
[33:35] anything if a dreamer, prophet or
[33:37] preacher, anything teaches contrary to
[33:39] this Bible, it's wrong.
[33:42] Let it be a curse, but it must be built
[33:44] solely upon this word as thus sayith the
[33:46] Lord. And if this word is correctly set
[33:48] in order and taught by the minister, God
[33:50] solemnly under obligation to his son,
[33:53] amen, to answer that word and fulfill
[33:55] it. Now, that's the way I believe the
[33:56] Bible, I believe every word of it. Like
[33:59] I told that story last week, did you
[34:00] ever hear brother say that? The preacher
[34:02] come to him and remember he said,
[34:05] "Brother Ram, here's my new wife."
[34:06] Brother Bam's like, "Where happened to
[34:08] your old wife?"
[34:10] And she's got makeup on, short hair,
[34:12] short short skirt and everything. And
[34:14] brother said, "Oh, nice to meet you,
[34:16] sister." and she walked away and he
[34:18] said, "Brother Bam, did you like my
[34:19] wife? Uh, my new wife. She's quite a
[34:22] saint, isn't isn't she?" And brother Ram
[34:23] said, "I thought she was a haint."
[34:26] In other words, she's not a saint. And
[34:29] he's he's like, "Well, you're right. You
[34:30] know, she does break some of those
[34:31] standards." But but brother, I saw a
[34:33] dream and the dream Jesus took my my my
[34:36] old wife away from me and said, "Here,
[34:38] you can marry this one." Brother Ram
[34:39] said, "Now, that sounds really sweet,
[34:41] but the devil gave you that.
[34:44] I don't care what dream. I don't care
[34:46] what experience you got. The Bible said
[34:48] you're ch you're uh bound to that wife
[34:50] as long as you live. That was the devil
[34:53] disguised as an angel of light to get
[34:55] that man to break the word of God.
[34:58] Hallelujah. So be brother Ram said
[35:00] brother Ram said we must not put too
[35:02] much emphasis on these things. You only
[35:05] put emphasis on it when it goes back to
[35:07] the word of God.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? Amen. Now I
[35:12] love this quote. I made a video about
[35:13] this this week. Look how humble brother
[35:15] Random is. Look at this saints. Now,
[35:17] there may be times I not I may not be
[35:20] able to set it together. Now, let me
[35:22] just take this approach. What if I went
[35:24] up to a tape worshipper, brother Ram? I
[35:26] said, and uh I said, uh I would say tape
[35:28] boy, like he calls him, a tape boy, did
[35:31] brother Ram said every word correctly in
[35:33] order. He'd say, "Yes, sir, brother
[35:34] Jesse, just press play and obey." And
[35:36] then I'd show him this quote. [laughter]
[35:39] What do you think he'd say? He said,
[35:41] "Well, no, no. Uh, well, brother's a
[35:42] prophet of God and I believe every word,
[35:44] but look, I could trap him. Couldn't I
[35:46] trap him? Did Brother Brandham uh said
[35:50] every word correctly? Was Brother Ram a
[35:52] mortal man? Did he die and live? Yeah,
[35:55] but did could he said every word
[35:56] correctly? Oh, absolutely, brother
[35:58] Jesse. He's a prophet of God. I won't
[35:59] listen to you. You're a preacher. I only
[36:00] listen to tapes. Uh, what about this? Is
[36:04] this thus sayith the Lord? You say every
[36:05] word is thus sayith the Lord. If this is
[36:07] thus sayith the Lord, you don't believe
[36:08] what thus sayith the Lord.
[36:11] So you're not with the Lord. You're
[36:12] believing the Antichrist.
[36:16] There may be times I may not be able to
[36:18] set it together. Can I say the same for
[36:19] me church? There's going to be times
[36:20] your pastor I not I may not be able to
[36:22] set every word correctly together.
[36:25] And according to brother Brandham accord
[36:27] which is the Bible which brother's
[36:29] referencing the Bible no mortal man can
[36:31] place every single thing together
[36:34] because God waits for a time to reveal
[36:36] his plan.
[36:38] Right? And we are not on the same level
[36:41] as God. We are in infinitely lower.
[36:43] Brother says a million miles below God.
[36:47] Hallelujah.
[36:49] And I don't BELIEVE THERE'S ANY MORTAL
[36:51] man in the world can correctly set every
[36:53] word together. But we can only can as
[36:56] the Holy Spirit inspires us to do. Many
[36:59] times the Bible's contrary to our
[37:01] teaching. Look how humble brother Am
[37:04] saying
[37:06] I'm almost done here. Oh yeah. I better
[37:07] finish here. Yeah. Uh
[37:09] Now let me just go through this real
[37:10] quick. Just now we went through the
[37:12] deeds of nicolatans real quick. I I last
[37:14] or three years ago I preached on the
[37:16] doctrines of devils. The first uh three
[37:19] are all scriptural. Paul says mandatory
[37:22] celibacy. Roman Catholic church.
[37:24] Mandatory vegetarian diet. Well, that's
[37:26] Catholic Church when they go through
[37:27] their seasons of no meat or whatever.
[37:31] Uh the raptures passed. Okay, that's a
[37:34] that's a false doctrine. That's a
[37:35] doctrine of a devil. No fasting.
[37:39] Now, that's one somebody told me, I
[37:40] said, "Nonsense."
[37:42] Uh, turning the grace of God into
[37:44] lawlessness. Once saved, always saved.
[37:46] Everyone will go to heaven.
[37:48] Universalism. That's a doctrine of a
[37:50] devil. God always wants you healthy and
[37:52] wealthy. That's a doctrine of a devil.
[37:55] Now, we want we all want to be healthy
[37:57] and wealthy, but it may not be God's
[37:58] will.
[38:01] Uh, calling Brother Brandham and his
[38:03] followers the greatest of all time.
[38:04] That's a that's a newer one. That's of
[38:06] the devil. That's a doctrine of a devil.
[38:09] None of us ought to say who's the
[38:10] greatest of all time. Let God say it.
[38:12] Alls we know is the Old Testament
[38:13] greatest of all time. That's all we
[38:14] know. John the Baptist was greater than
[38:17] Moses. Imagine that. John the Baptist
[38:19] was greater than Enoch and Elijah who
[38:21] were raptured. Wrap your mind around
[38:23] that one. They got raptured. John got
[38:26] beheaded. John was greater than the boys
[38:28] that were raptured. The men, the godly
[38:30] men that were raptured. I didn't mean to
[38:32] say boys, but the godly men that were
[38:34] raptured. John was greater.
[38:37] They say rapturing faith is literally on
[38:40] brother Ram's tapes. Again, that's
[38:41] idolatry. That's a doctrine of the
[38:43] devil. Rapturing faith is in heaven and
[38:45] Jesus is going to send it down.
[38:47] Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. The
[38:49] Bible said he'll pour out the latter
[38:51] rain in James chapter 5. It's coming
[38:53] from heaven. It's not on your phone.
[38:54] Praise God. Is that right, church?
[38:58] And then lastly, they make a tradition
[38:59] out of the prophet's life.
[39:02] Right? Jesus said, "The very one you say
[39:06] you believe Moses will accuse you
[39:08] because you've turned down Moses's
[39:09] word." Right? You claim to be Abraham's
[39:13] children. If you are of Abraham, you do
[39:14] the works of Abraham. The very one they
[39:17] claim to let me say it like this. The
[39:19] very ones that follow Charles Finny,
[39:21] brother, right, in that church, Charles
[39:23] Finny will condemn them because of their
[39:26] homosexuality. Think about that. Oh, we
[39:28] were we're Charles Finny's church. It
[39:30] was a beautiful church, brother.
[39:32] Brother Roger gave me a great tour.
[39:33] Everybody needs to go there. It's a
[39:36] beautiful tour. But see, they claim to
[39:38] follow that. Now, the same thing is true
[39:39] for Luther Wesley, right? Isa Street.
[39:41] They claim all this, but the very ones
[39:44] they say they they believe they're
[39:45] contradicting their Bible teachings, and
[39:47] therefore they'll be condemned by them.
[39:50] They made a tradition out of
[39:52] Christianity when it's not a tradition.
[39:54] It's a living spirit.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's a living
[39:59] organism. Hallelujah. The the God's body
[40:02] is a living body. It's a living
[40:03] organism. The Holy Ghost is here inside
[40:06] the body of Christ.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, I better I better close
[40:10] here. Let me get on to this final thing.
[40:12] I'll close. Uh
[40:15] I'll do one more quote and then I'll
[40:17] just close. I got a couple Bible
[40:18] examples. I love this. Brother Ram says,
[40:20] "I like to see everything come out of
[40:21] the Bible." This is such a beautiful
[40:24] This is such a beautiful truth. Look at
[40:25] this here. Everybody listening here now?
[40:28] Give me Give me your attention here. I'm
[40:29] almost there. I love this. So, the Bible
[40:31] is perfectly true and that's what we
[40:33] said on the Bible. It must be thus
[40:35] sayith the Lord. Now, I love this. Now,
[40:36] we do believe God can do things that's
[40:39] not written this word, do we not? I
[40:42] believe God can do anything. Doesn't
[40:43] have to be written in this word. God can
[40:45] do anything he wants other than sin,
[40:46] right? Do things that against his nature
[40:49] because he's God. He does whatever he
[40:51] wishes. But yet, so even think even even
[40:54] recognizing that yes, God is so great.
[40:57] He can do things outside of here. But
[40:59] yet, I love this. I like to see anything
[41:03] when it comes in a line of doctrine. He
[41:06] says, "Come out of the Bible."
[41:09] God can do things outside the Bible, but
[41:12] I want to see it, Brother Rod. Come out
[41:14] of the Bible.
[41:15] Is that right, Sister Quesa? Amen. I'm
[41:17] just calling names here. Is that right,
[41:18] BROTHER MERCY? GOD COULD do things out
[41:20] of here, but if he's going to do it, I
[41:22] want to see it in the word. Praise God.
[41:24] You know why? Because then I got a place
[41:26] to stand.
[41:28] It's not just well brother had a feeling
[41:30] sister had a feeling sister had a dream
[41:32] that brother spoke in tongues that one
[41:34] interpreted that one did a miracle
[41:36] remember blood and oil came out brother
[41:37] said he met the man who saw that
[41:39] preacher uh have the syringe and bring
[41:42] blood out of his hands and then he had a
[41:44] table he dip his hands in oil there in
[41:46] the 1960s and tried to pretend he had
[41:48] blood and oil coming out of his hands to
[41:49] try to uh impress the people like he was
[41:52] something spiritual brother said you
[41:54] can't trust in that you don't find blood
[41:56] and oil on people's hands in the Bible.
[41:59] So, don't trust in it. DON'T BE
[42:01] DECEIVED. TRUST IN the Holy Spirit. The
[42:03] Holy Spirit will direct you to the word
[42:05] of God. Amen. Oh, I love it. But yet,
[42:09] God can do things outside the Bible. But
[42:11] yet, the Bible's the full revelation of
[42:13] Jesus Christ. The Bible said that's what
[42:15] it is. It's the revelation of Jesus
[42:17] Christ. Nothing is to be added to it or
[42:19] taken away from it.
[42:23] Now, how can these people say brother
[42:24] Ram made a prediction that he thought
[42:26] the world would be destroyed by 1977?
[42:28] How can they say that's thus sayith the
[42:30] Lord? It's not even in the Bible and
[42:32] then it didn't even happen. And brother
[42:34] Ram said it's not the Lord saying that.
[42:36] This is just my own opinion.
[42:38] And yet 1977 is not in the Bible. So how
[42:42] can you add that to the Bible and make
[42:44] it equal to the Bible?
[42:46] Nothing's to be added to it and nothing
[42:49] taken from it. So, I like to stay right
[42:51] in what it says and what it promises. If
[42:53] he just do what he promised, that's all
[42:56] I care to see anyhow, then I know I'll
[42:58] see him. Oh, church. If he just does
[43:02] what's in here, won't you be happy about
[43:03] that? Praise God.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, just do what's IN HERE. JUST LAY
[43:07] HANDS ON the sick uh and they'll
[43:09] recover. Just speak in tongues and
[43:11] prophesy and interpret and all these
[43:13] things and raise up the dead. Let the
[43:15] blind see. JUST DO THAT IN HERE AND I'LL
[43:17] BE HAPPY WITH IT. Praise God.
[43:20] Hallelujah.
[43:22] Now, in closing, let me close with this.
[43:24] I'm just going to close with two Bible
[43:25] examples. You've been a wonderful
[43:26] audience.
[43:28] Just briefly.
[43:31] Now, church, I'm going to end with a
[43:32] king who loved the word and a prophet
[43:34] who loved the word. Remember church,
[43:36] what happened in the days of Hezekiah.
[43:41] Hezekiah was almost a thousand years
[43:43] after Moses. Moses saw all his people
[43:47] rebelling. And God said, "Go get a
[43:49] serpent, right? Uh, make it brazen. Make
[43:51] a brass serpent. Put it up on the pole."
[43:53] And it was in the shape of a cross.
[43:55] Hallelujah. And God said, "Anybody who's
[43:58] bitten by the snakes, just look and
[44:00] you'll be healed. Look and live." The
[44:02] Bible says, there's a beautiful song on
[44:04] it from the old days. Look and live, my
[44:06] brother. Live. Look to Jesus now and
[44:09] live.
[44:10] That's according to the word.
[44:12] Hallelujah. It is only that we look and
[44:15] live.
[44:17] Hallelujah.
[44:19] So Moses held that up. If there's two
[44:21] million people in the church and they're
[44:22] all bit by snakes, how many got healed?
[44:26] Maybe a million. Maybe hund maybe
[44:29] 750,000.
[44:31] Who knows? Many died also. But anybody
[44:34] who looked at that, they lived.
[44:37] Now the Bible never records after that
[44:39] moment. The Bible never records that
[44:41] anybody got healed looking at that
[44:42] serpent again. But it became a
[44:45] tradition. They started using it and and
[44:48] the Bible said in the days of Hezekiah,
[44:50] it became an idol.
[44:53] So what would a godly man like Hezekiah
[44:56] do? When he sees something that was
[44:58] supposed to be good be used for evil,
[45:01] what do you think he did? Think about
[45:02] that. What did he do to that brass
[45:04] serpent?
[45:06] How many How many remember by God's
[45:08] grace?
[45:09] He took that thing. He didn't kiss it
[45:11] like the Catholics kiss their statues.
[45:13] Think about that, church. He did not
[45:15] kiss that that that brass serpent. Oh, I
[45:17] love you. And oh, because of you, my
[45:20] million people were healed just looking
[45:21] at you. I love this. Oh, I feel tingles
[45:24] when I touch it.
[45:27] Bunch of nonsense. It's idolatry. Right.
[45:29] The people they got into idolatry. The
[45:32] Bible said
[45:35] he broke in pieces the brass serpent
[45:38] that Moses had made. You say, "OH, DON'T
[45:40] TOUCH THAT, HEZEKIAH. That's the prophet
[45:42] of gods. That's that's his actual staff.
[45:46] Don't touch it." And Hezekiah said, "You
[45:48] guys are worshiping it. You've made this
[45:51] your focus instead of the Lord God."
[45:54] So, he took it and broke it. And he just
[45:56] didn't break it in half like a Bo
[45:58] Jackson kind of break on the baseball
[46:00] bat. He stomped it and break it into all
[46:02] these pieces. In other words, you're not
[46:04] going to rebuild this idol. You're not
[46:06] going to make this your idol. You're
[46:08] going to worship God. You're going to
[46:09] trust in God, not in an object for
[46:11] healing. You're going to make God your
[46:13] object of worship. Hallelujah.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; HE LOVED GOD SO MUCH, HE TOOK WHAT was
[46:19] then idol and broke it in pieces so
[46:22] nobody could get it anymore. And church,
[46:24] that's how you'll know you love God.
[46:27] When you when you see the idols in your
[46:28] life and you destroy them for the glory
[46:31] of God,
[46:33] that's how you know you'll get down to
[46:34] business with God. That's how you'll
[46:36] know that you'll do what's right in the
[46:38] sight of God. That's how you'll know
[46:40] when you trust in God. And there'll be
[46:43] nobody like you at your job. Right,
[46:45] Malachi?
[46:46] Right, Mercy? Right, brother Chris?
[46:49] There'll be nobody like you at your job
[46:50] if you take all the idols and break them
[46:53] up. I'll say like this. There'll be not
[46:55] many churches like our message church if
[46:57] we break up the all the idols around the
[46:59] message
[47:00] which I'm getting to be in a real good
[47:02] habit of doing that. Making all these
[47:03] videos with each video I'm stomping more
[47:06] and more on their idols of brother
[47:07] Brandham is absolute and the tapes are
[47:10] the absolute and all these false ideas
[47:12] they hatched out of hell. I'll say it
[47:14] like that. They come from demons.
[47:16] Hallelujah.
[47:18] And all these demons
[47:20] ideas they got to be stomped and broken
[47:22] to pieces. So, I'll say this, God's
[47:25] people won't be even uh tempted to look
[47:27] at them. They'll look to God alone.
[47:31] And church, that's how you'll cleave to
[47:33] God. Who wants to cleave to God? That
[47:34] word cleave means glue.
[47:37] You're going to do what's right. Right.
[47:39] So, what he didn't put glue on the the
[47:41] brass serpent. He put put glue between
[47:43] him and God.
[47:45] Amen.
[47:47] How do you do that? Break up any idol.
[47:49] Anything that's tempting you, crush it.
[47:51] Stomp it. break it into a hundred pieces
[47:53] or whatever more. Hallelujah.
[47:57] Get rid of it. Show God that you mean
[48:00] business with him. That shows you love
[48:02] him. And then God will honor you. And
[48:05] then church, look, you will be prospered
[48:08] in wherever you go.
[48:11] If you can break up and destroy the
[48:13] idols in your life. And the church said,
[48:17] brother Ram said, "Many times people
[48:18] stray away and they make an idol out of
[48:20] the very thing God has ordained." Look
[48:23] at the brass serpent. Did you know the
[48:24] prophet, now look what brother said,
[48:26] "This isn't thus sayith the Lord."
[48:27] Brother said, "The prophet had to tear
[48:28] that serpent to pieces." Did a prophet
[48:30] break that into pieces? No. The king
[48:33] did. So again, just another proof,
[48:35] brother Rod, that these people are
[48:36] insane. They say, "Every word is thus
[48:38] sayith the Lord." A prophet didn't break
[48:39] into pieces. It was King Hezekiah.
[48:43] Why? Because the people were worshiping
[48:45] the serpent and they made an idol out of
[48:47] it. Do you believe you can do that
[48:48] today? You can make an idol out of your
[48:51] church. Now, church is important, but
[48:53] don't make this an idol. Well, I'm only
[48:55] saved as long as I go to this church.
[48:57] It's an idol.
[49:01] You can make an idol out of your pastor,
[49:04] but I know nobody does that because you
[49:06] see all my failures. [laughter]
[49:08] Hallelujah. I'm not that I'm not that uh
[49:11] perfect. So,
[49:14] Now, John the Baptist was though,
[49:15] remember he said, "Are you the They
[49:16] said, "Are you the Christ?" He was so
[49:18] much like Jesus. They And but that's
[49:20] that's one of the highest compliments
[49:21] you can get where when people start
[49:24] calling you Jesus or some like you are
[49:27] you're the Christ. John was so much like
[49:30] Christ that they confuse Christ for
[49:33] John. John, what did John say? No, I'm
[49:35] not. I'm not even worthy. There it is.
[49:38] I'm not even worthy to lose his shoes.
[49:40] Hallelujah.
[49:42] You can make idol out of your church,
[49:44] out of your pastor. You can make an idol
[49:45] out of an evangelist.
[49:48] And I'm afraid that that's what a whole
[49:49] lot it's being done. They idolize the
[49:50] man. Like I told you years ago, the
[49:52] saint uh the saint would always say,
[49:53] "Oh, brother Digs is coming to town. I
[49:55] better get my life in order. Why don't
[49:56] you get in order while the pastor is
[49:57] preaching? Why don't you just live in
[49:59] order?"
[50:01] What What was she doing? She's making an
[50:03] idol out of that evangelist. Oh, I don't
[50:06] want to get caught in my sin. Why don't
[50:07] you just confess your sin every day so
[50:09] you don't got to get caught?
[50:11] What are you What are you afraid of?
[50:13] Like why would you hold on to sin until
[50:15] the preacher comes in town? Jesus is in
[50:17] town. AMEN. JESUS NEVER LEFT TOWN. AMEN.
[50:21] JESUS IS HERE.
[50:24] SEE, it's so easy. Well, I'll get right
[50:27] with God when the rapture is going to
[50:28] come. You won't be ready. It'll be too
[50:30] late. Let's be ready now.
[50:33] And last one. Yeah. He Hezekiah loved
[50:35] the word more than he loved the
[50:36] tradition of the message churches. That
[50:38] was just the tradition of the master
[50:39] churches. I'm sorry I'm going long. Last
[50:41] one. Musician musician's going to come.
[50:43] Let's stand. I love this. This is a
[50:46] prophet of God.
[50:48] How do we know Peter loved Jesus?
[50:51] Because he dedicated the rest of his
[50:53] life to feeding the sheep. Three times
[50:56] Jesus asked Peter, "Do you love me?"
[50:58] What if I asked you that tonight,
[50:59] Brother Chris? Do you love me, brother?
[51:01] You say, "Yeah, brother Chris, do you
[51:03] love me?" I ask him twice. Yeah, brother
[51:06] Jess. Yeah. Well, Chris, do you love me?
[51:09] [laughter]
[51:11] Think about that. I mean, how would you
[51:13] feel if three times somebody has to ask
[51:15] you if you love them? So, you know why?
[51:18] Because Peter denied him three times.
[51:19] And Jesus never wanted him to forget.
[51:21] Remember, you failed. But you don't have
[51:23] to fail from here on out. Amen. I'm
[51:25] going to SEND YOU THE HOLY GHOST.
[51:26] HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. GO UP AND WAIT
[51:29] in Jerusalem TILL YOU'RE ENDUED WITH
[51:30] POWER FROM ON HIGH.
[51:33] He said, "If you love me, feed my sheep.
[51:35] If you love Jesus, church, feed somebody
[51:38] else. Now, you that are married, you got
[51:40] a good opportunity to do that, don't
[51:41] you? You sisters can feed your husbands.
[51:45] Right? You fathers can feed your
[51:48] children, your brothers and sisters,
[51:49] too, brother. That's right. That's
[51:51] right. God bless you.
[51:54] You show Jesus your love for him by
[51:57] feeding other people. Right. Beatress by
[51:59] holding l.
[52:02] That's how you show Jesus you love him,
[52:04] right?
[52:06] be there for somebody else,
[52:09] right?
[52:11] Love somebody other than yourself.
[52:12] Because remember the temptation of this
[52:14] day, they were lovers of their own
[52:16] selves more than lovers of God. Church,
[52:19] find somebody to show the love of Jesus
[52:22] Christ.
[52:24] Aren't you glad the pro the prophet uh
[52:26] Peter loved the word of God? Amen. Let's
[52:28] bow our heads. [snorts]
[52:31] Lord, I am glad Peter loved you.
[52:34] Hallelujah. He loved you so much. He was
[52:36] crucified upside down apparently by
[52:38] history.
[52:42] He fed the the the sheep the word of
[52:44] God. He wrote those two beautiful
[52:46] letters. Talked about the statue of
[52:47] perfect man, persecution. Judgment
[52:50] begins at the house of God. Hallelujah.
[52:52] Thank you, [music] Jesus.
[52:54] He even said, Paul's scriptures are hard
[52:56] to understand,
[52:58] but he believed them. Lord Jesus, let
[53:02] the people here under the sound of my
[53:04] voice, may [music] they, Lord, feed
[53:06] someone else, either physically or
[53:08] spiritually, Lord God, may they find
[53:11] someone to love and feed. [music] That
[53:13] will prove how much they love Jesus.
[53:16] Taking care of someone else, putting
[53:19] their own needs in the back seat behind
[53:22] the scenes. As we said on [music]
[53:23] Sunday,
[53:25] help us all to put our plans and our
[53:29] dreams, our desires, our selfish
[53:30] ambitions behind the scenes so that we
[53:33] can feed somebody else. I think of these
[53:36] mothers nursing right now. They're
[53:37] probably feeding another one right now.
[53:38] Lord God, doing just what you said. If
[53:41] you love me, feed my sheep. Feed those
[53:44] little babies.
[53:48] Peter, if you love me, preach the word.
[53:50] Lord, I believe you'd say, "Pastor
[53:52] Jesse, if you love me, feed the word
[53:55] [music] to my people." Lord, I've tried
[53:56] to do that tonight. Lord God,
[53:59] I love these stories of your men of God
[54:01] down through the ages, how they love the
[54:03] word. Lord, help us to love the word.
[54:05] Help us to meditate upon the word,
[54:07] believe every word, take every dream and
[54:09] vision back to the word of God to make
[54:12] sure we're [music] right with you, Lord
[54:14] God. May we not make an idol out of
[54:16] money, Lord, or sexuality, Lord God, or
[54:20] greed or possessions, Lord God, or our
[54:23] church or anything, Lord God.
[54:27] May we have no idols. May we just have
[54:30] the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. May
[54:33] we have our Lord God Almighty, which was
[54:35] and is and is to come. And Lord, help
[54:38] these people who are deceived into
[54:40] worshiping the tapes. And brother
[54:42] Brandham, God, I just pray you'd call
[54:44] all out. Come out of her, my people. May
[54:46] you bring your people out of such
[54:48] [music] nonsense, heresy, and blasphemy,
[54:51] from these doctrines of devils, these
[54:53] doctrines that were hatched out of hell.
[54:55] Lord, I just pray you'd call your true
[54:57] elect ones out, Lord God. And thank you
[54:59] that we have one absolute. There's no
[55:01] other. It's God's absolute. It's your
[55:03] absolute, the Holy Bible. Help us to
[55:06] believe a promise if we're going through
[55:08] a storm. Give us grace and strength
[55:10] [music] tonight. I pray. We bless your
[55:11] people, Lord. May they love the Bible
[55:14] more after tonight. I pray, God, help us
[55:16] all to love the Bible more after
[55:17] tonight. Every word is thus sayith the
[55:19] Lord, just to know thus sayith the Lord.
[55:22] [music] What a blessing
[55:25] how we can prove it over and over again.
[55:28] So [music] God, we thank you, Lord.
[55:31] Thank you for hearing our prayers
[55:32] tonight in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[55:35] church said, "Amen." And praise God.
