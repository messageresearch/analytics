[33:00] people and tongues stood before the
[33:02] throne and before the lamb clothed with
[33:04] white robes and palms in their hands and
[33:08] cried with a loud voice saying salvation
[33:11] to our God which sitteth upon the throne
[33:13] and unto the lamb the prophet said this
[33:16] is the quietest place you ever gonna
[33:18] live a multitude crying salvation to our
[33:24] God which sitteth upon the throne and
[33:27] unto the lamb a multitude without number
[33:30] o gonna be a glorious day that day oh
[33:35] thank you Jesus and all the Angels stood
[33:39] round about the throne and about the
[33:41] elders and the four beasts and fell
[33:43] before the throne on their face
[33:44] and worship God saying amen
[33:48] blessing and glory and wisdom and

[33:52] might be unto our God for ever and ever

[34:06] of the elders answered and said unto me
[34:07] what are the arrayed in white robes and
[34:11] whence can they and I sent him Sir thou
[34:13] knowest and he said to me these are they
[34:15] which came out of Great Tribulation not
[34:18] the Great Tribulation but they came out
[34:20] of Great Tribulation the Prophet
[34:24] emphasizes that and have washed their
[34:27] robes and made them white in the blood
[34:28] of the Lamb therefore are they before
[34:31] the throne of God and serve Him day and
[34:33] night in his temple and he that sitteth
[34:35] on the throne shall dwell among them
[34:37] they shall hunger no more neither shall
[34:39] sorry neither thirst any more neither
[34:42] shall the Sun light on them nor any Heat
[34:47] let's read 17 together ready one two
[34:50] three four the lamb which is in the
[34:54] midst of the throne shall feed them and
[34:56] shall lead them unto living fountains of
[34:59] waters and God shall wipe away all tears
[35:02] from their eyes let's have one more word
[35:05] of Prayer if you have a need on your
[35:06] heart let's just make it known unto God
[35:07] hear Heavenly Father we just come to you
[35:09] tonight Lord we're needy we need a fresh
[35:11] touch of fresh anointing Lord why pray
[35:13] Lord you just inspire us through these
[35:15] scriptures Lord God let this be our
[35:17] testimony Lord and if you grant him by
[35:19] your grace and by the blood of that lamb
[35:21] dear God may we be among this multitude
[35:25] dear God we ask it humbly reverently in
[35:28] Jesus Christ's name and the church said
[35:30] Amen god bless you being seated praise
[35:32] God okay you can flip over there I got
[35:37] just some quotes I'd like to share here
[35:38] tonight
[35:45] relations seven here like to look at
[35:48] this here and then we'll get to more
[35:54] willing Chapter eight and the future by
[35:56] God's grace
[35:57] so with Chapter seven this is part two
[35:59] of this chapter and then part 86 now
[36:03] last time we looked at the 144,000 a
[36:05] couple weeks ago that was a real
[36:08] blessing by the grace of Lord and I
[36:10] think it was just like two days after
[36:11] that when he sent me a link to an
[36:13] article about the hundred about the Jews
[36:15] and how they're working more on building
[36:18] their their there their steps up to an
[36:22] altar and I just seen the article last
[36:23] week two from the Temple Mount Institute
[36:26] they've got this altar built up there by
[36:28] the Wailing Wall and so they're getting
[36:30] closer they're wanting to practice now
[36:33] they're not going to sacrifice until
[36:34] they get their actual temple but they're
[36:36] so longing to have a temple that they're
[36:38] already building that platform and they
[36:41] have an altar and then they practice up
[36:42] there which is really striking and Wendy
[36:45] didn't know I preached on it you know
[36:45] because she was a I think of the other
[36:47] church on the Wednesday night so it was
[36:49] I saw two witnesses there so I was happy
[36:52] about that
[36:52] but let's look tonight at this
[36:54] Revelation chapter 7 so 1 through 8 was
[36:58] the 144,000 we looked at that as we said
[37:01] now verses 9 to 17 is the Gentile
[37:04] multitude so let's look at this tonight
[37:07] by God's grace now the main question and
[37:10] I preach us a little while ago
[37:11] the main question and message believers
[37:14] Minds is is this the bride or the
[37:16] foolish virgin now I don't know about
[37:19] you but I just found three more quotes
[37:22] today to make it six quotes about the
[37:25] being the bride and one about the
[37:27] foolish version I got more now I got we
[37:31] got some more ammunition here or just
[37:33] say we've got more proof that we feel
[37:35] it's the bride now as we'll get to this
[37:37] a little later if people want to believe
[37:38] this is the foolish version that's okay
[37:40] too it doesn't really matter to me it's
[37:43] not a point of argument or it's not a
[37:45] point of contention but it is
[37:49] interesting to look at it and I think if
[37:51] you look at the the evidence brother
[37:53] Branham says if you look at the evidence
[37:55] in the text
[37:56] it looks like it's the bride so let's go
[37:58] through these quotes
[37:59] now I'm going chronologically in order
[38:01] this is a new one because I made it in
[38:03] yellow I don't know if you can tell it's
[38:04] yellow or not can you tell that's yellow
[38:05] up there okay this is from January 3rd
[38:09] 1954 brother random reads revelation
[38:12] 7:15
[38:14] therefore they are before the throne of
[38:16] God and serve Him day and night in the
[38:18] temple now where does mrs. Branham serve
[38:21] me at in the house
[38:23] that's the bride mrs. Neville that's
[38:25] where she stays in the house serving you
[38:27] that's where the bride's at not the
[38:29] servants the bride all right now it's
[38:32] interesting the Bible uses the word
[38:34] serve but then brother Branham says not
[38:36] the servants so you got to be real
[38:38] careful how you interpret brother
[38:40] branham's quotes because the Bible said
[38:42] then he says the bride is gonna serve
[38:44] him but he said not the servants the
[38:45] bride so just got to keep it straight
[38:48] and just you know got to keep it
[38:49] straight like I said this doesn't
[38:51] pertain to salvation this actually
[38:52] pertains to rewards right future events
[38:55] and like I said we're not going to spend
[38:56] many sermons on this chapter I think
[38:58] just two and then we'll move on you know
[39:00] to chapter eight now this is the the
[39:03] second quote this is from the seal of
[39:07] God four months later brother Graham
[39:10] reads revelation 7:14 these are they
[39:13] which come out of Great Tribulation he
[39:14] said they're called Holy Roller made fun
[39:17] of persecuted laughed at so see program
[39:20] says if you even get laughed at for what
[39:22] you believe you're getting persecuted if
[39:25] someone calls you a Holy Roller oh you
[39:27] just think you're so much holier than us
[39:30] or you're just some old legal s see when
[39:33] anytime you get made fun of it's great
[39:36] tribulation come out up out of Great
[39:40] Tribulation and watch their robes and
[39:42] made them white in the blood of lamb
[39:43] watch they are before the throne of God
[39:46] where does the wife stay says four
[39:48] months later where does the Queen stay
[39:50] that's the bride the Gentile bride and
[39:53] they serve Him day and night in the
[39:54] temple he said my wife serves me at the
[39:57] house day and night see that's the bride
[39:59] of Jesus that's the Gentile bride quote
[40:04] number two third one as a new one I
[40:07] found today from the Philadelphia Church
[40:11] age December 10th there's Lydia's
[40:12] birthday
[40:13] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[40:14] the throne shall feed them and lead them
[40:16] in the fountains of waters and God shall
[40:18] wipe all tears from their eyes there he
[40:21] is there's the bride oh my how beautiful
[40:23] the bride amens there's your three new
[40:28] ones they were all earlier than any ones
[40:30] I never heard before now number four is
[40:33] one I preached already bo-ram says now
[40:35] if you want to see the bride come up
[40:37] after that after the 144,000 to show
[40:40] this 144,000 it's not the bride just
[40:43] continue to read now on down from that
[40:45] that he says oh I mean from the seventh
[40:48] chapter let's start at the ninth verse
[40:50] because the eight verses the sealing of
[40:51] Benjamin the twelve thousand now like
[40:55] this he reads verse eight in Chapter
[40:57] seven he said I'm sorry this is verse
[40:59] nine and after this hello a great
[41:02] multitude which no man could number here
[41:04] comes the bride amen so verse nine in
[41:08] Chapter seven the prophet of God said
[41:10] here comes the bride and I wonder if
[41:13] Jesus would look out at you and tonight
[41:15] say here is the bride here comes the
[41:18] bride is the bride here tonight praise
[41:20] God this ought to be the bride here
[41:22] tonight praise the Lord
[41:24] what does your wife do she serves you in
[41:26] the house you sit down she give your
[41:28] food she fixes the clothing she serves
[41:31] you day night in the house and this one
[41:33] these of all nations the Gentiles which
[41:35] is the bride are before the throne of
[41:37] God with him day and night I'll remember
[41:40] what we said last night and talked on it
[41:42] all right now we're skipping a heads
[41:45] that was 1960s so we have we have four
[41:47] quotes before 1960 before the seals this
[41:51] one's after the seals will the prophet
[41:55] of Malachi 4 be the one to call the
[41:57] Gentile remnant of revelation 7:9 even
[41:59] though they go through the Tribulation
[42:00] Period no no after the revelation 7 is
[42:04] where we've seen the 144,000 sealed
[42:06] after that he saw coming up coming back
[42:08] was that great number which no man could
[42:10] number which was the bride the mouth
[42:14] then Malachi 4 we finished in the bride
[42:16] taken up and the group of the Elijah and
[42:18] Elijah returned back to the earth for
[42:20] the church to go through the Tribulation
[42:22] Period but Elijah and Elijah will not
[42:24] have anything to do with the sleeping
[42:26] bird
[42:26] they're Gentiles they'll be sent only to
[42:28] the Jews
[42:29] praise God now number six the sixth and
[42:34] final one so now I used to have three
[42:35] verse one now I've got six verse one if
[42:38] anyone really wants to search you to
[42:39] have praise God number six this is from
[42:42] the church age book whether random
[42:44] allowed this to be in print so I put a
[42:46] little bit more emphasis on the church
[42:49] age book because he had time and time to
[42:51] read it over and mother Jose has a
[42:52] article from sister Rebecca that says
[42:55] they she edited it I think five times
[42:57] brother I think that was five times I
[42:59] think brother Jose sent that to me so
[43:01] sister Rebecca testified that she and
[43:03] brother Branham read through this book
[43:05] five times so I just put a little bit
[43:08] more weight on that cuz he had time and
[43:10] time again to go over it but man said
[43:12] God is talking about the bride here do
[43:14] you want to see another picture of her
[43:15] it's over revelation 7 4 to 17 and I
[43:19] heard the number of them which were
[43:20] sealed okay so there's the six there's
[43:23] six of them now the only time he called
[43:25] revelation 7 the foolish version was in
[43:28] the seventh seal he said now we're in
[43:31] the age of the eagle the revelation to
[43:33] be revealed the whole thing now compare
[43:35] this with Revelation the tenth chapter
[43:36] verse 1 to 7 and we'll see here in this
[43:39] revelation 10 1 to 7 that in the days of
[43:41] the sounding of the seventh angels
[43:42] message was the finish of all the
[43:45] mysteries of God now we find now in the
[43:47] sixth seal now being open it was a
[43:48] three-fold purpose now here was the
[43:51] purposes the first thing was that the
[43:53] seeping versions had to go through the
[43:54] Tribulation Period for purification she
[43:57] had to be purged of her sins of unbelief
[43:59] and rejecting the message so look she
[44:01] rejected the message and that's striking
[44:04] so that's interesting the foolish virgin
[44:07] hears the message but she rejects it now
[44:10] I think a lot of those people actually
[44:12] be in message churches because they had
[44:14] actually got to hear it or maybe they
[44:16] heard it on Facebook or maybe they heard
[44:18] it on YouTube right this she was done in
[44:23] the tribulation period we see they wind
[44:25] up over here in Revelation 7 between the
[44:27] 6th and 7th chapter that she had been
[44:29] purged and she been given her robes
[44:33] shibam says the the foolish virgin we
[44:37] see her in the seventh chapter we
[44:39] in the six and seven chapter all right
[44:42] now this is an interesting thought
[44:45] brother kam and I were talking on this
[44:46] and I believe this is the bride but
[44:49] brother Brett kam and I was talking and
[44:51] we it kind of came out it could be both
[44:53] this could potentially be both the
[44:56] foolish virgin and the wise virgin it
[44:58] could be both not really sure but I
[45:01] believe it's the bride myself now here's
[45:04] the reason why brother Brandon says they
[45:07] asked for the RAM where are the foolish
[45:09] virgins during that thousand-year
[45:11] millennium and he says in the Millennium
[45:14] there in the grave the rest of the Dead
[45:17] lived not for a thousand years now this
[45:20] quote is a little mysterious because as
[45:23] far as I know there's only two options
[45:25] where a soul can go it can either go to
[45:28] prison the prison house in the heart of
[45:31] the earth or it goes to the sixth
[45:34] dimension under the altar because the
[45:37] Jews who are not born again where do
[45:39] they go they go to the sixth dimension
[45:41] under the altar and they're not born
[45:44] again they're not even trying to get to
[45:47] the blood they don't even know there is
[45:49] a blood of Jesus Christ for them so to
[45:53] me this quotes of the mysterious we
[45:54] don't understand this but to me I
[45:57] believe the foolish merchantmen she's
[45:59] got to go one or the other well she's
[46:02] she's justified as sanctified she just
[46:04] not filled with Holy Spirit so I believe
[46:06] if God lets the Jew who's don't even
[46:08] look to the blood if God lets the Jew
[46:10] the faithful Jew come up God will let
[46:12] the foolish virgin come up because at
[46:14] least she's burgeoned to the word that's
[46:16] my understanding I could be wrong
[46:19] because if the Jews without the Holy
[46:22] Ghost go to heaven the sixth dimension
[46:23] and not the prison when the foolish
[46:25] virgin without the holy ghosts have a
[46:27] similar waiting place now recall this
[46:30] remember there's no slow sleeping all
[46:33] foolish virgin are live somewhere and
[46:36] thank God for that praise God because
[46:39] brother an tells us there's no soul
[46:40] sleeping they can't go like and and have
[46:43] their souls resting in the in that
[46:45] casket their souls don't risk in the
[46:47] casket the Bible says every man lives
[46:50] and then the judgment right
[46:53] so the foolish version is going to be
[46:55] saved on on the white throne judgment
[46:57] then they if they're going to be saved
[46:59] then they've got to go to the same place
[47:01] because they're not going to be judged
[47:02] they're not going to go to hell right
[47:04] they're not going to be in the prison
[47:05] house they're not going to be waiting in
[47:07] prison they were just foolish so I
[47:09] believe they've got to go up to the
[47:11] sixth dimension somewhere now the fifth
[47:15] seal program says this now the Jews they
[47:17] had their blindness martyred their
[47:19] Messiah and now they were reaping it
[47:22] they realize it they recognize after it
[47:24] was going on they seen then when they
[47:27] come before the altar of God but now is
[47:29] now the grace of God is to them all
[47:33] right now look at that church they they
[47:35] martyred Jesus Christ they killed Jesus
[47:38] Christ but they're still grace for them
[47:40] and the church said Oh amazing grace
[47:43] amen oh thank God for Amazing Grace II
[47:46] then God gives grace to people that
[47:50] murdered his own son no no we know they
[47:53] were blind but God's grace extended to
[47:56] them because they made Jesus Christ a
[47:58] martyr blindly but I have said now watch
[48:02] they could not by no means be Saints
[48:04] because they would already be robed amen
[48:08] see a saint of God gets a roll right now
[48:12] praise God if you're a believer you've
[48:15] got a new robe on you might not see it
[48:17] on my outside we might not have the
[48:19] nicest clothes but if you're a saint of
[48:21] God you've got the shiniest white robes
[48:23] on you could possibly want praise God
[48:25] there's no Clorox so there's no
[48:27] department store Coles or anybody nobody
[48:30] can produce out a wider road than the
[48:32] right white robe you've got all by the
[48:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[48:38] see there already rode but here they are
[48:41] now just souls under the altar for the
[48:43] word of God and the testimony they held
[48:45] for being God's people the Jews but now
[48:47] watch the grace of God comes to them and
[48:50] Jesus gives them each one a white robe
[48:53] watch plumb over after the church is
[48:57] gone raptured up because they were loyal
[48:59] to their cause and they were blinded and
[49:02] they didn't know it they didn't know it
[49:05] they didn't know it they were playing
[49:06] exactly the
[49:07] part of the God ordained for them to
[49:08] play and here John looks over and sees
[49:11] souls under the altar praise God
[49:15] Amen thank the Lord now look what he
[49:20] says see I believe he said this official
[49:24] proves the opening of this seal in the
[49:26] last day it takes soul sleeping plumb
[49:29] out of the way there see they're alive
[49:31] they're not dead so faithful Jews
[49:35] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:37] are living that I meant alive not live
[49:41] in the sixth dimension they're alive
[49:44] praise the Lord they're alive there's no
[49:47] soul sleeping the soldiers don't lay
[49:50] there in the casket they go somewhere
[49:52] and a church das ìitís you're attracted
[49:55] one way or the other
[49:56] let's be attracted to heaven praise God
[49:57] so that when when we drop this natural
[50:00] body of God terry's that our souls will
[50:02] be taken up praise God the angels of God
[50:04] will pack us to the presence of God amen
[50:07] let's be magnetized to heaven hallelujah
[50:10] like like that machine brother Aaron
[50:12] talked about the factory that had the
[50:13] magnet and I pulled up all the all the
[50:15] shavings of of the metal let's be
[50:18] shavings a metal that's me little licks
[50:20] of fire off the main fire and let's be
[50:22] raptured up hey man hallelujah glory I
[50:27] remember there's only seven dimensions
[50:29] light matter time science hell's the
[50:33] fifth dimension paradise and then God
[50:36] you've only got seven dimensions so the
[50:38] foolish virgin she's not going to be in
[50:40] these three or those four she's either
[50:43] going to be in five six or seven and if
[50:46] the Jews who's blinded doesn't go down
[50:48] here even though they were martyred
[50:49] Jesus or made Jesus a martyr how could
[50:53] God let the foolish virgin go here I
[50:54] don't think he would I think he would
[50:56] take him to paradise amen
[50:58] now only the only the real predestiny to
[51:01] get to go there that 24 the 24 elders
[51:03] and Moses and Elijah amen only they get
[51:07] to really go up there before the time
[51:09] they go to the seven dimension by the
[51:11] throat of God does that help by God's
[51:14] grace the foolish virgin has to go
[51:16] either five six or seven
[51:18] and it seems like she'd have to go to
[51:20] six I
[51:20] believe because there's no soul sleeping
[51:23] the souls don't go to sleep they have to
[51:25] they have to be alive somewhere now
[51:27] where are they I don't know that's why I
[51:29] said revelation seven could be the the
[51:32] foolish and the wise together it could
[51:35] be or there could be another place under
[51:37] the altar for the foolish virgin we
[51:39] don't know but there's a special place
[51:41] for the Jews those who don't have white
[51:43] robes on imagine there'd be a special
[51:45] place for the the first version who
[51:47] don't have white robes either
[51:48] because they're not born again not but I
[51:51] could be wrong
[51:53] now let's balance some of these quotes
[51:56] because what people have got upset with
[51:58] me on emails of course and not really in
[52:00] person but some people said oh how can
[52:02] you be a pastor when you don't take the
[52:05] clue in the in the seven seals where
[52:07] program said revelation seven is the
[52:09] foolish virgin he said don't you know
[52:10] the seals were the most inspired sermon
[52:13] brother Branham preached and I said well
[52:14] yeah they were but they weren't the only
[52:15] inspired one brother Bram preached right
[52:20] now here's what I'm gonna skip that now
[52:26] brother Ram did say if I ever preach
[52:28] anything that was inspired in my life it
[52:30] was the seals but you have to remember
[52:32] that was just one quote and he didn't
[52:34] say thus saith the Lord it was the most
[52:35] ever and every single word was thus
[52:38] saith the Lord he never said that but
[52:40] see people will hang on a quote and
[52:41] without proper balance they'll think
[52:44] they're right and they won't be open to
[52:46] receiving more of the Holy Spirit's
[52:48] revelation or they won't even be open to
[52:50] maybe thinking I'm wrong see that's
[52:52] pride pride has taken over rather than
[52:55] meek humility the learners attitude
[52:58] where God can teach you more about the
[53:00] word of God in souls that are in prison
[53:03] programs they remember the seven seals
[53:05] was finished when those seven revealed
[53:07] truths one of them he wouldn't permit us
[53:08] to know how many was here at the seven
[53:10] seals hurt all of you okay I guess the
[53:12] seventh seal you wouldn't permit it he
[53:15] stood right there in the room and
[53:16] revealed every one of them and if I ever
[53:18] preached anything in my life was
[53:20] inspired it was that and it ought to be
[53:23] true to you stand here and tell you that
[53:24] even it's going to happen and go right
[53:26] there and even science and everything
[53:28] else that scientific research and
[53:29] everything mystery to the people prove
[53:32] that it happened right there and come
[53:34] back and hear it unfold
[53:35] make every word exactly right what day
[53:37] are we living in where we at now
[53:42] remember not every word in the seals was
[53:45] thus saith the Lord
[53:46] brother I made a mistake right when he
[53:49] preached on the sixth seal and they
[53:50] asked him brother man did you mean to
[53:52] say 7000 who had not bowed their knee to
[53:54] Balaam or 700 seven thousand I meant to
[53:58] say forgive me for that so see he said
[54:01] something wrong he said forgive me for
[54:02] that it's just a matter of speech like I
[54:05] said awhile ago did you notice me stay
[54:06] here and they bear records seeing the
[54:08] lamb see the lamb was on earth see bear
[54:11] record seeing the Spirit of God coming
[54:13] upon the lamb now yes I'm at forgive me
[54:19] please and you brethren you on the tape
[54:20] out there friends listen I didn't mean
[54:22] to say that like that of a minister of
[54:27] the gospel many times as I preach that I
[54:29] know that was 7000 I just happen to say
[54:31] 700 I didn't I didn't mean just 700 I
[54:34] just didn't read it out of the scripture
[54:37] praise God so what's the absolute is
[54:40] brother Graham the absolute err is the
[54:42] scripture the absolute the scripture it
[54:46] just come to my mind while I was talking
[54:48] I just said 700 instead of 7,000 I make
[54:51] them mistakes all the time and if you
[54:54] listen to the tapes that's right but to
[54:57] us it doesn't really matter about those
[54:58] little mistakes because we know what
[55:00] he's talking about
[55:01] right and we're not trying to try to
[55:04] find some secret revelation that that's
[55:06] so mysterious that that makes us better
[55:08] than the other churches we're not trying
[55:12] to find that we're trying to be in one
[55:14] accord with the other churches we're not
[55:16] trying to exalt ourselves above other
[55:18] churches now look look how humble
[55:21] brother Branham says I sure am a dummy
[55:23] he says now that's that's really being
[55:26] humble because he's not so you forgive
[55:28] me I didn't mean to do that okay so
[55:32] there's this man that gets so upset at
[55:34] me and said oh you want to take the
[55:35] seven seals don't you know that's the
[55:37] most inspired one well yeah it was
[55:40] inspired
[55:40] it's very inspired but that doesn't mean
[55:42] every word is better than other sermons
[55:45] if that's the case let's just take the
[55:47] seven seals and just get rid of
[55:48] everything else you know
[55:51] because what about this quote church
[55:53] program says notice after them seven
[55:55] seals uniting of the people what United
[55:59] signs the red flashing light of the last
[56:00] days the sign of women getting prettier
[56:02] and man what they would do all these
[56:04] signs of the Holy Spirit leading up that
[56:06] come right back there to the capping off
[56:08] of all those messages since the seven
[56:09] seals it's capped off in this one thing
[56:12] the token that we are all right see just
[56:16] check ourselves and see if we're in the
[56:18] faith so the brother Adam says the seven
[56:20] seals all the service after the seven
[56:22] seals are capped off in the token the
[56:25] baptism of only ghosts so the token is a
[56:28] very important message as well the seals
[56:30] are important but the token is very
[56:32] important because the token says we're
[56:34] all right praise God and we are going in
[56:37] there after the token is our ticket in
[56:40] the rapture praise God hallelujah to see
[56:44] people exalt well the seals are higher
[56:46] than this now don't get me wrong there
[56:47] was great revelation the seals but
[56:49] you've got to take all of it and you've
[56:51] got to line it all up with the Word of
[56:52] God now I'm gonna do some Bible teaching
[56:59] here by the grace of Lord I want to
[57:03] preach about maybe half an hour more
[57:05] Lord willing
[57:07] and let's go through this chapter so if
[57:09] you got to Bob let's go through
[57:10] revelation 7 here and let's look at some
[57:15] evidence that proves this is the bride
[57:17] but like I said honestly it could be the
[57:20] foolish virgin and the bride it could be
[57:22] because the timing of it may be it may
[57:26] be after it may be after Armageddon and
[57:30] it may be in the Millennium now one
[57:35] thing's for sure it doesn't look like
[57:37] it's in the future home because the
[57:40] Bible said they're in a temple they're
[57:42] in a temple and in the future home
[57:44] there's no more temple because the Bible
[57:46] said the lamb is the temple are with me
[57:50] Church so this has either got to be at
[57:54] the marriage supper of the Lamb while
[57:56] the tribulation is going on or it's got
[57:59] to be in the Millennium it's either one
[58:01] or the other now we've been taught
[58:03] that the foolish version doesn't live in
[58:04] the Millennium that that's probably true
[58:06] but it could be we you know but it was
[58:08] never said thus saith the Lord so it
[58:10] could be that they live and serve
[58:11] somehow I don't know I've always taught
[58:15] that that the foolish virgin doesn't
[58:18] reign in the Millennium but then where
[58:21] would where would she have to be she
[58:22] have to be in that six dimension then
[58:23] right she can't be in the fifth she
[58:26] can't be in the one two three four right
[58:28] because there's no soul sleeping so
[58:31] there's either guys she's either got to
[58:32] be in the fifth six but maybe not the
[58:35] seventh right if that's the case all
[58:40] right so let's look at some scriptures
[58:43] so verse nine and after this I beheld
[58:45] and lo a great multitude which no man
[58:48] could number of all nations and
[58:51] Kindred's and peoples and tongues stood
[58:55] before the throne and before the lamb
[58:56] clothed with white robes and palms in
[58:59] their hands now did you notice if you go
[59:07] to Revelation 10 verse 11 and he said
[59:10] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[59:12] many peoples nations tongues and kings
[59:16] so we have a little bit of an overlap
[59:18] with peoples and nations and tongues
[59:21] there okay see how there's a little bit
[59:24] of overlap revelation 10 of course deals
[59:27] with the bride because she receives the
[59:29] open book from the seventh angel who
[59:31] received it from Christ she eats the
[59:34] book and then she prophesize again to
[59:37] all Kindred's nations tongues and kings
[59:39] well now we see in heaven now we see
[59:42] that group is up in heaven amen so that
[59:45] proofs that the bride of Jesus Christ is
[59:47] going to take the message all around the
[59:49] world amen
[59:51] that's right praise God thank you lord
[59:55] so verse nine proves that in Revelation
[59:58] 7 verse 9 it proves it
[1:00:02] all right now
[1:00:04] let's look at a few scriptures about the
[1:00:05] multitude so if you got your Bible here
[1:00:12] now why don't I just do this one I just
[1:00:14] pull it up up here it might make it a
[1:00:17] little bit easier
[1:00:17] alright Galatians three seven I might
[1:00:20] just make it easier for everybody
[1:00:23] Galatians three seven eight nine all
[1:00:27] right know ye therefore that they which
[1:00:29] are faith the same of the children of
[1:00:31] Abraham and the scripture foreseeing
[1:00:33] that God would justify the heathen
[1:00:34] through faith preached before the gospel
[1:00:36] unto Abraham saying in thee shall all
[1:00:38] nations be blessed so then they which
[1:00:41] are of faith are blessed with faithful
[1:00:43] Abraham praise God
[1:00:47] so here we see all nations remember
[1:00:50] revelation 7:9 said a number no man
[1:00:53] could number of all nations so here is
[1:00:56] the all nations that have the same faith
[1:00:59] of blessed Abraham praise God alright
[1:01:08] now let's go to Revelation 19 verse six
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:17] six and seven and as I heard as it were
[1:01:21] the voice of a great multitude and as I
[1:01:23] heard the voice of many waters and as
[1:01:25] the voice of mighty thunderings saying
[1:01:26] Alleluia
[1:01:27] for the Lord God omnipotent rain let us
[1:01:32] be glad rejoice and give honour for the
[1:01:34] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[1:01:36] wife hath made herself ready praise God
[1:01:40] everybody see the great multitude the
[1:01:42] voice of a great multitude so when Jesus
[1:01:45] gets ready to come back John hears a
[1:01:48] great multitude saying Alleluia the Lord
[1:01:51] God omnipotent reigneth area oh there's
[1:01:55] a there's a multitude in heaven and they
[1:01:57] know Jesus is going to come back and
[1:01:59] they say praise our God the Lord God
[1:02:03] omnipotent reigns Jesus is coming back
[1:02:05] to get his bride who's made herself
[1:02:07] ready ha ha ha hallelujah amen it's
[1:02:12] great multitude this voice of many
[1:02:14] waters
[1:02:15] that's Jesus's voice right the Bible
[1:02:17] said
[1:02:18] is that a voice of many waters
[1:02:21] hallelujah
[1:02:23] and they say hallelujah for the Lord God
[1:02:25] omnipotent reigns oh my this is the
[1:02:28] quietest place we're ever going to be
[1:02:30] hallelujah thank the Lord amen now did
[1:02:35] you know the name Abraham from other
[1:02:37] scripture Abraham means father of a
[1:02:40] multitude so this great multitude is the
[1:02:45] scene of Abraham because Abraham means
[1:02:47] father of a multitude praise God all
[1:02:55] right now that's verse 9 revelation 7:9
[1:02:58] I'm gonna go back there hello
[1:03:06] I heard a great I'm sorry a great
[1:03:08] multitude which no man could number of
[1:03:09] all nations and Kindred's peoples into
[1:03:14] this all nations kindred tongue and
[1:03:15] people we made a connection to
[1:03:17] Revelation 19 in Revelation 10 they have
[1:03:20] to be Gentiles with faith in Jesus
[1:03:22] Christ and they stood before the throne
[1:03:24] and before the lamb clothed with white
[1:03:27] robes and palms in their hands
[1:03:29] now look Church there before the lamb so
[1:03:32] this either has to be at the marriage
[1:03:34] supper of the lamb or this has to be in
[1:03:36] the millennial reign because the Lambs
[1:03:38] they're right when the 144,000 get the
[1:03:41] Holy Ghost the Lambs with them praise
[1:03:44] God this has to be at the marriage
[1:03:46] supper of the lamb or after Armageddon
[1:03:49] after the atomic fire burns the earth
[1:03:51] and the Saints walk out on the ashes of
[1:03:54] the wicked and they they build houses
[1:03:56] and inhabit you know that happiness of
[1:03:58] the earth for a thousand years but this
[1:04:01] is before the lamb and notice Church
[1:04:05] they're clothed with white robes so
[1:04:07] these people had the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:10] Ghost because that's what right white
[1:04:12] robe represent amen
[1:04:13] Alleluia and they got palms in their
[1:04:16] hands praise the Lord
[1:04:17] they got palms in their hands what the
[1:04:20] praise our God hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:04:25] so we see it's got to be Holy Ghost
[1:04:28] field Saints now that's what I believe
[1:04:30] that's why I believe it's the bride if
[1:04:33] the Jews didn't have white robes yet
[1:04:35] remember there they say give us white
[1:04:37] robes you know they cry out for
[1:04:39] vengeance they don't have the baptism
[1:04:40] all the ghosts if they don't have them
[1:04:42] then I wouldn't think the foolish virgin
[1:04:44] would have white robes so that's why I
[1:04:46] do believe it is the bride but it could
[1:04:48] be both it's like I said it could be
[1:04:49] sometime after there could be some
[1:04:51] mystery that I don't understand yet
[1:04:53] alright verse 10 and cried with a loud
[1:04:59] voice saying salvation to our God which
[1:05:01] sitteth upon the throne amen and under
[1:05:04] the lamb so see God is the lamb right
[1:05:07] it's not a second person the lamb is God
[1:05:10] amen hallelujah that's right
[1:05:14] so we see the oneness of the Godhead in
[1:05:17] verse 10
[1:05:20] all the Angels stood round about the
[1:05:21] throne and about the elders and the four
[1:05:23] beasts and fell before the throne on
[1:05:24] their faces and worship God so the
[1:05:28] elders of 24 elders and the four beasts
[1:05:31] mine can you imagine all the angels with
[1:05:34] the four cherubim with the twenty-four
[1:05:36] elders and they're the ones that fall
[1:05:39] down the great multitudes got their
[1:05:41] palms and they're waving their palms but
[1:05:43] then this special group right around the
[1:05:45] throne they fall down and church what
[1:05:48] does it show the closer you get to God
[1:05:50] the more humble you are hey hey man are
[1:05:53] you with a church are ya those closest
[1:05:56] to the throne are the ones that fell
[1:05:58] down and praise so the closer you get to
[1:06:01] God the more you love love you have for
[1:06:04] God the more humble you're gonna be and
[1:06:06] the more you're gonna fall down when
[1:06:08] you're in his presence Oh hallelujah
[1:06:11] that's good church that's real good see
[1:06:16] because you see a lot of people that
[1:06:17] come to our church or other churches and
[1:06:19] they never bow down they never humble
[1:06:21] themselves to the word they just warm up
[1:06:24] you right but where's the ones that are
[1:06:27] really humble really receiving the Word
[1:06:30] of God really wanna worship those are
[1:06:32] hard to find but the closer you get to
[1:06:34] God the more humble you are amen that's
[1:06:38] right that's true church the closer the
[1:06:42] more you pray the closer you get to God
[1:06:44] that's right so see the ones closest to
[1:06:48] Christ are the ones that fall down and
[1:06:51] worship that's good that's right verse
[1:06:57] 12
[1:06:57] saying amen blessing glory wisdom
[1:07:01] Thanksgiving honor and power and might
[1:07:03] be unto our God for ever and ever amen
[1:07:06] there's that Sevenfold worship again
[1:07:08] right seven is the number of completion
[1:07:10] seven blessings they they bless on the
[1:07:13] Lord seven words of blessing
[1:07:14] starting with blessing and one of the
[1:07:19] elders answered saying unto me what are
[1:07:21] these are these which are arrayed in
[1:07:23] white robes and whence came they so who
[1:07:27] are they and how do you get a white robe
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:32] this is what I kind of want to
[1:07:34] broan for a little bit here how many
[1:07:38] want to be in that multitude now how
[1:07:41] many want to be there well you're gonna
[1:07:43] find out how to get there if you want to
[1:07:45] get there you can find out tonight how
[1:07:47] to get there hey Laurie what are these
[1:07:52] and whence came they how did they get
[1:07:55] here who are they
[1:07:57] how'd they get here and I said sir down
[1:08:00] of us and he said to me these are they
[1:08:02] which came out of Great Tribulation and
[1:08:05] have washed their robes and made them
[1:08:07] white in the blood of the Lamb alright
[1:08:11] let's look at tribulation alright now in
[1:08:18] Matthew 13 21 remember there's four
[1:08:21] kinds of grounds four kinds of hearts
[1:08:24] let's just look at the scripture here
[1:08:27] the second kind where do they fall away
[1:08:32] for the Bible said they get offended
[1:08:35] when they get teased for being in the
[1:08:38] message or they get offended when when
[1:08:41] somebody makes a comment
[1:08:42] oh you're look at your wife and skirts
[1:08:44] oh I can't you you're just a why
[1:08:47] can't you come in and go to the party
[1:08:49] with us man be a real man but the Bible
[1:08:53] said he had no root in himself but
[1:08:55] dureth for a while this is the seed that
[1:08:57] falls on the stony ground for when
[1:09:00] tribulation or persecution arises
[1:09:02] because of the word by and by he's
[1:09:05] offended alright so how do you how are
[1:09:11] you going to get there Church you have
[1:09:13] to endure persecution you have to be
[1:09:17] offended I'm sorry you cannot be
[1:09:20] offended by the Word of God you have to
[1:09:23] just stand with the Word of God amen
[1:09:26] that's the great test you can't get
[1:09:28] offended when people make fun of you you
[1:09:30] can't be offended when people leave you
[1:09:33] can't be offended when someone speaks
[1:09:34] evil about you or makes or makes you
[1:09:37] look like a fool you can't be offended
[1:09:39] you've got to just stand with the Word
[1:09:41] of God you've got to be more impressed
[1:09:44] with the Word of God then you are with
[1:09:45] your feelings you've got to care nothing
[1:09:48] for
[1:09:48] your feelings and you've got to think
[1:09:49] great things about Jesus Christ amen
[1:09:52] hallelujah glory thank you lord
[1:09:58] the trouble is today people get offended
[1:10:01] one little thing oh don't tell anybody
[1:10:04] what church I go to don't tell anybody
[1:10:06] what I believe this is a rugged coming
[1:10:09] out time for me how about you church I'm
[1:10:11] putting all this things I I just like

[1:10:17] about ready to come out Lord willing
[1:10:19] everyone's gonna know where I stand if
[1:10:20] if I haven't had a chance to talk to him
[1:10:22] yet they're gonna find out pretty soon
[1:10:24] we're gonna see how much offense I can
[1:10:26] give or how much offense I can take by
[1:10:28] the grace of God we must not be offended
[1:10:32] we've got to humbly say the word is on
[1:10:35] absolute I'm standing by Jesus because
[1:10:38] Jesus is the word of God glory see
[1:10:44] tribulation tribulation is gonna arise
[1:10:48] it's gonna rise up against you right
[1:10:51] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:10:54] Spirit of God will raise the standard
[1:10:56] against it amen
[1:10:57] ah don't you like that praise God look
[1:11:00] at that it's gonna rise there's the
[1:11:02] flood there's the enemy coming in like a
[1:11:04] flood it rises against you so God is
[1:11:07] gonna raise you up Church amen when if
[1:11:10] something comes again when your friends
[1:11:12] come against you or an adult comes
[1:11:14] against you or or somebody of a preacher
[1:11:17] comes against you when that rises
[1:11:19] against you God's gonna raise you up
[1:11:21] against that Amen can I say like this
[1:11:25] your wave is coming to say like that
[1:11:27] when that wave comes against you don't
[1:11:30] get discouraged there's gonna be a wave
[1:11:32] come to raise you up against it
[1:11:35] hallelujah God will raise a standard
[1:11:38] against the enemy that's right all right
[1:11:41] John 16:13 praise God John 16:33
[1:11:51] the
[1:11:52] spoken unto you that in me you might
[1:11:55] have peace in the world you shall have
[1:11:57] no you might have you possibly may have
[1:12:00] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:12:04] but be of good cheer I have overcome the
[1:12:08] world
[1:12:08] a man glory you shall have tribulation
[1:12:16] remember Jesus who are they who are the
[1:12:18] angel they are they which came out of
[1:12:21] Great Tribulation all Christians have to
[1:12:25] go through tribulation they in the world
[1:12:28] you shall have tribulation praise God
[1:12:32] it's not it's not an option if you're a
[1:12:35] real Christian you're gonna be
[1:12:37] persecuted you're gonna be rejected it's
[1:12:42] the Word of God
[1:12:43] all right acts 14 12 just gonna kind of
[1:12:48] want to build your faith here you know I
[1:12:50] know it's built in mind you like I said
[1:12:51] because with everything the book coming
[1:12:53] out everything I'm sure I'm gonna get a
[1:12:54] little bit of backlash but God's with me
[1:12:57] praise God confirming the souls of the
[1:13:00] disciples and exhorting them to continue
[1:13:02] in the faith and that we must through
[1:13:05] much tribulation enter into the kingdom
[1:13:07] of God amen
[1:13:09] a little bit of tribulation or much much
[1:13:15] tribulation we must enter into the
[1:13:18] kingdom of God now look at the
[1:13:27] compromise Romans 5:8 preached on this
[1:13:30] recently I believe no 5/3 by whom also
[1:13:37] we have access by faith into this grace
[1:13:39] wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of
[1:13:42] the glory of God and not only so but we
[1:13:45] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[1:13:48] tribulation worketh patience so we take
[1:13:55] courage when we go through trials
[1:13:58] because we know it's producing patience
[1:14:02] we glory in that oh thank you lord I
[1:14:05] know you're working it out I know I'm
[1:14:07] going through a great trial going
[1:14:08] through a going through a great battle
[1:14:10] but it's gonna produce patience in my
[1:14:12] life and the church said the Bible said
[1:14:16] we glory in it so we say Oh glory praise
[1:14:20] God God's using this to make me a
[1:14:23] patient person I don't want to be an
[1:14:26] impatient pastor I want to be a patient
[1:14:29] pastor you don't want to be an impatient
[1:14:33] father or mother or grandmother or
[1:14:35] grandfather you want to be a patient
[1:14:37] parent or grandparent well the only way
[1:14:41] that happens is to go through
[1:14:43] tribulation it's got to work in you
[1:14:47] trials got up working you
[1:14:54] thank God that patience works experience
[1:14:56] and experience gives you a real hope
[1:15:02] romans 8 one of the most encouraging
[1:15:05] chapters in the Bible who shall separate
[1:15:13] it from the love emulation or distress
[1:15:15] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:15:17] peril or sword none of these things that
[1:15:20] we hardly know about the only that we
[1:15:22] could get close to it just be
[1:15:23] tribulation or maybe some distress we
[1:15:26] might go through a little maybe a little
[1:15:27] bit of persecution but famine nakedness
[1:15:30] peril or sword we none of us have
[1:15:32] probably gone through that but it's it's
[1:15:35] it's it's known to the scripture these
[1:15:38] things cannot separate you from the love
[1:15:41] of Christ in other words God loves you
[1:15:44] in the midst of persecution God loves
[1:15:47] you in the midst of tribulation in the
[1:15:49] midst of troubles in the midst of peril
[1:15:51] God loves you he's not going to easily
[1:15:54] did not pull his love away from you his
[1:15:56] love is with you amen that's right why
[1:16:01] because you're a sheep he loves his
[1:16:04] sheep as is written for thy sake we are
[1:16:06] killed all the day long we are accounted
[1:16:08] as sheep for the slaughter amen nay and
[1:16:15] all these things we are more than
[1:16:16] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:16:19] praise God so you know you see what the
[1:16:25] Bible says you were made to conquer your

[1:17:37] Paul was persuaded Paul made up his mind

[1:18:20] because the persecutions in mind let's
[1:18:22] see 2000 or 99 I gave my heart to Lord
[1:18:25] so these twenty years I've served the
[1:18:29] Lord now it's already twenty years my
[1:18:30] goodness these twenty years I've served
[1:18:32] the Lord
[1:18:33] they've only helped me fall more in love
[1:18:35] with Jesus and they haven't been able to
[1:18:37] separate me from the love of Jesus
[1:18:39] Christ amen
[1:18:41] hallelujah nothing can separate me from
[1:18:45] the love of Christ persecution won't
[1:18:47] tribulation won't
[1:18:50] that's because God's love is shut down
[1:18:52] in my heart that's what the Bible says
[1:18:55] glory
[1:18:57] talked about
[1:18:58] powerful chapter that's a way to end it

[1:19:05] bride's the elect who's gonna put any
[1:19:07] sin on you where you're you're not gonna
[1:19:09] be justified before God who's gonna do
[1:19:11] that no one the Bible said no one can do
[1:19:14] that because his love separates you from
[1:19:17] all your sins amen
[1:19:19] is forgiveness the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:19:22] separates you from your sins praise God

[1:19:37] start flirting with the things of the
[1:19:39] world you fall more in love with the
[1:19:40] world then you'll fall in love with
[1:19:42] Jesus Christ or let's not flirt with the
[1:19:45] world Church let's stay in love with
[1:19:47] Jesus Christ

[1:25:57] does that require it requires sacrifice
[1:25:59] it requires dedication but we know with
[1:26:05] a lot of people what happens as they get
[1:26:07] older they just get relaxed right they
[1:26:11] they they stop trying to do do their
[1:26:15] best and they just get they just get

[1:26:25] to grow they don't want to sacrifice
[1:26:27] anything that's something we all have to

[1:26:50] all right well I better finish
[1:26:53] here by God's grace it's almost been an
[1:26:55] hour all right let's go back to
[1:26:57] Revelation 7:14 we'll hit a few more
[1:27:05] things and we'll finish up here but I
[1:27:08] hope you can see if you are going to be
[1:27:12] there with the white robe you're gonna
[1:27:13] have to go through tribulation Great
[1:27:15] Tribulation what was brother branham's
[1:27:21] remember we looked at a few weeks ago he
[1:27:22] moved out well as he went on and he
[1:27:25] started preaching doctrine you know the
[1:27:27] Serpent's eat around 58 he started
[1:27:29] getting less and less invitations less
[1:27:30] and less letters and then once he moved
[1:27:32] to Arizona he didn't get any invitations
[1:27:34] except from the business The Full Gospel
[1:27:36] businessmen can you imagine getting all
[1:27:39] them invites being so popular and then
[1:27:41] by the end just a few 10 or 15 years
[1:27:44] nobody likes you anymore nobody cares
[1:27:48] about you anymore
[1:27:49] everybody talks evil about you everybody
[1:27:52] says well Hosea he fell away at the end
[1:27:54] of his life he was a good man but then
[1:27:55] he fell away everybody well this this
[1:27:58] this brother served God pretty good but
[1:28:00] that you know Iggy back said you know he
[1:28:02] don't have nothing to do with him the
[1:28:05] Bible said we must enter through great
[1:28:08] persecution if that was brother
[1:28:12] Brandon's persecution what about ours
[1:28:15] that's why I don't feel bad when I don't
[1:28:17] get as many calls anymore to go preach
[1:28:19] places or people you know people call me
[1:28:23] less or talk to me less I don't feel bad
[1:28:25] if I get rejected because I know as
[1:28:28] Jesus went through three poles as
[1:28:30] brother Branham went through his three
[1:28:32] poles they didn't get more popular they
[1:28:34] got more rejected so how is how is the
[1:28:39] world going to accept me am I gonna get
[1:28:42] more popular am I gonna be rejected I'm
[1:28:44] probably be more rejected I'd imagine
[1:28:47] that's okay whatever it takes to be like
[1:28:50] Jesus whatever suffering it takes to be
[1:28:53] like Jesus I know he's with me Church in
[1:28:56] any trouble he's with you this
[1:29:00] he's with you in any trouble all right
[1:29:05] great tribulation and they washed their
[1:29:08] robes and made them white in the blood
[1:29:13] of the Lamb
[1:29:14] all right acts 22:16 that's good a few
[1:29:24] washing scriptures this ought to
[1:29:29] encourage all of us here I remember what
[1:29:37] they told Paul when he got saved Paul
[1:29:38] finally got saved he said and now why
[1:29:40] tarriest thou arise in me baptized and
[1:29:43] wash away thy sins calling upon the name
[1:29:46] of the Lord
[1:29:47] how does washing happen washing comes by
[1:29:50] repenting calling on God God forgive me
[1:29:53] fill me with the Holy Ghost a the head
[1:29:56] hallelujah that's what our children need
[1:29:59] to learn that's why I bring my children
[1:30:02] up here to pray right children
[1:30:03] eventually children I want you to start
[1:30:05] praying for the Holy Ghost you got a
[1:30:08] call to God for the Holy Ghost you say I
[1:30:10] have to say God I want to be filled with
[1:30:12] the Holy Ghost that's the reason why a
[1:30:14] lot of people don't get it because they
[1:30:16] don't call on the Lord O Jesus fill me
[1:30:19] with the Holy Ghost oh Jesus they don't
[1:30:21] call on God they just say well I guess I
[1:30:23] got it and they don't get it you've got
[1:30:27] to call you got to really repent you got
[1:30:29] to be baptized you got to get sanctified
[1:30:31] and you've got the call on God and
[1:30:33] children you don't have to go to a
[1:30:35] special meeting get the Holy Ghost you
[1:30:37] get those it goes right here Amen said
[1:30:39] he got the Holy Ghost right here breaks
[1:30:41] God amen it's okay to go to meetings to
[1:30:45] get the Holy Ghost that's fine but if
[1:30:47] you get back from that meeting and
[1:30:49] you're not on fire with the baptism Holy
[1:30:51] Ghost after a few months you didn't get
[1:30:53] the Holy Ghost

[1:35:59] wash you how are you gonna get wash you
[1:36:02] gotta really want to be washed praise
[1:36:06] God
[1:36:07] and daddys not braggin I'm just telling
[1:36:10] you that's that's how you act when you
[1:36:11] get washed because everyone I know acts
[1:36:14] like that
[1:36:15] now Simon and Cameron are a little
[1:36:17] different they'll stay up all night till
[1:36:19] like 4:00 a.m. but I'll get up at 4:30
[1:36:22] so they stay up all night to get in the
[1:36:24] wash I go to bed early I get it a bit
[1:36:27] early in the morning to get washed but
[1:36:29] the main thing to do is get what I say
[1:36:31] men because those are the only ones
[1:36:34] that'll be in that great multitude those
[1:36:36] who are lost those who are justified
[1:36:39] sanctified by the spirit of our God
[1:36:42] and filled with the Holy Ghost those are
[1:36:45] the ones that are going to be there
[1:36:52] hallelujah
[1:36:54] titus 3:5 they going to just be true
[1:36:59] it's gonna be though church members who
[1:37:00] really wanted to be washed by the Holy
[1:37:02] Ghost in other words Jesus I really want
[1:37:05] to be clean I'm tired of not being clean
[1:37:07] I'm tired of treating people this way I
[1:37:09] want to be wash I want to be clean all
[1:37:18] right I'm gonna try to move a little
[1:37:19] faster here now this says we were
[1:37:25] sometimes foolish disobedient deceived
[1:37:29] hateful hating one another but after
[1:37:32] that the kindness of God our Savior
[1:37:33] appeared and not by works of
[1:37:36] righteousness we have done but according
[1:37:38] to His mercy he saved us by the washing
[1:37:41] of regeneration and the renewing of the
[1:37:45] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost washes you
[1:37:50] until you're regenerated in other words
[1:37:53] you have a new life in you
[1:37:55] you realize and I'm sure that the older
[1:37:58] Saints realize this you realize I did
[1:38:01] not act like this before
[1:38:03] but I am regenerated now I am revived
[1:38:07] now I have new life now I can recognize
[1:38:11] I didn't have this life and now I've got
[1:38:14] life I'm regenerated praise God I used
[1:38:20] to not act like this but now I act like
[1:38:23] this because I'm washed amen
[1:38:26] praise God this is what the washing is
[1:38:36] like it's like a regeneration it's like
[1:38:40] a renew life and that's the washing of
[1:38:45] the Holy Spirit praise God all right so
[1:38:51] what does Gentile people do there are
[1:38:53] great multitude there Abraham seed they
[1:38:56] come through great persecution and
[1:38:58] tribulation their comfort and all the
[1:39:00] tribulation there wash in the blood of
[1:39:02] the Lamb praise God
[1:39:04] but they've got to call out for it call
[1:39:07] upon the name of Lord wash me Jesus wash
[1:39:09] me alright last one number 15 verse 15
[1:39:19] therefore are they before the throne of
[1:39:21] God and serve Him day and night in his
[1:39:24] temple let me go there
[1:39:30] and he that sitteth on the throne shall
[1:39:34] dwell among them alright so let's look
[1:39:40] at the temple who had these multitude
[1:39:45] serve Him day and night in his temple
[1:39:48] Ravana already tells us the wife serves
[1:39:52] the husband right now I want to show you
[1:39:57] too that there is no temple in the New
[1:40:02] Jerusalem let's go to Revelation 21 you
[1:40:07] got your Bible verse 21 21 21 and the 12
[1:40:15] gates were twelve pearls every several
[1:40:18] gate was of one pearl and the street of
[1:40:21] the city was pure gold as it were
[1:40:22] transparent glass and I saw no temple
[1:40:25] therein for the Lord God Almighty and
[1:40:28] the lamb are the temple of it and the
[1:40:32] city had no need of the Sun neither the
[1:40:34] moon is shining it for the glory of God
[1:40:35] did lighten it and the lamb is the light
[1:40:38] thereof even the lambs the light the
[1:40:41] lambs the temple Jesus is our all-in-all
[1:40:43] praise God he's all of it hallelujah
[1:40:49] alright sixteen they show how
[1:40:55] no more neither thirst gnome anymore
[1:40:58] neither shall the Sun light on them nor
[1:41:00] any heat for the lamb which is in the
[1:41:05] midst of the throne shall feed them and
[1:41:07] shall lead them unto living fountains of
[1:41:10] waters and God shall wipe away all tears
[1:41:13] from our eyes amen
[1:41:16] church any memories any sad memories any
[1:41:22] people we love that were lost and he
[1:41:25] hurts from our past Jesus is gonna wipe
[1:41:28] all the tears away from our eyes he's
[1:41:31] gonna bring healing there's anything sad
[1:41:34] about anything to cry about anything to
[1:41:36] be disappointed about anything at all
[1:41:38] Jesus is gonna be the one he's so
[1:41:41] comforting he's gonna wipe away all this
[1:41:43] multitudes tears can you imagine
[1:41:45] that's gonna take a little while as in
[1:41:47] the church he's gonna wipe away all
[1:41:49] tears from their eyes let's stand to our
[1:41:53] feet here now as you stand I'm gonna
[1:42:01] give you two more reasons why I think
[1:42:02] this is the bride and brother Jose might
[1:42:05] might catch this one I think we talked
[1:42:07] about this one if this is the foolish
[1:42:10] virgin
[1:42:11] how can they be washing the blood of
[1:42:14] Jesus when there was no blood on the
[1:42:16] mercy seat during the tribulation there
[1:42:23] was no spirit of God the Bible said the
[1:42:25] Spirit of God will will be there until
[1:42:28] the antichrist comes down the Bible said
[1:42:31] he will only let until Satan be brought
[1:42:33] down to earth and then he the letteth
[1:42:34] will ascend
[1:42:36] there's no Spirit of God there for
[1:42:38] washing I don't know I'm just saying I'm
[1:42:42] just telling you what I what I what I
[1:42:44] can see here and number two
[1:42:50] are these Saints before the throne of
[1:42:52] God day and night when they are not part
[1:42:54] of the bride of Jesus Christ so how
[1:42:57] could the foolish virgin be there day
[1:42:59] and night always before the lamb when
[1:43:02] they're not even a part of his wife
[1:43:04] right they weren't a wise wife they were
[1:43:07] a foolish woman they were foolish woman
[1:43:11] not the wise woman
[1:43:15] does everybody see that by God's grace
[1:43:18] how can they be washing the blood when
[1:43:20] there's no blood or spirit for them and
[1:43:22] then how can they be always with the
[1:43:25] lamb when they're not the bride they're
[1:43:26] not born again they're not baptized with
[1:43:29] the Holy Ghost now Church could I be
[1:43:31] wrong on some of these things sure I
[1:43:32] could be wrong but I think the the
[1:43:37] important thing for tonight is to know
[1:43:38] that God is with you in all of your
[1:43:40] trials right and then if you want more
[1:43:43] of God and if you want to be a more
[1:43:45] perfect Christian you got to cry out for
[1:43:46] it
[1:43:47] praise God it's Malachi there come to
[1:43:49] the piano sir all right I think that's
[1:43:59] playing don't you church I think it's
[1:44:00] pretty plain there I try to just pull
[1:44:03] everything I could to finish chapter
[1:44:04] seven that's all I have on that as far
[1:44:07] as I know I may have other things but
[1:44:10] Hosea there's something else you have
[1:44:11] let me know I see six quotes against one
[1:44:14] quote now I'm not trying to say they're
[1:44:17] fighting each other but I see evidence
[1:44:19] six evidence over here verse 1 then we
[1:44:22] have those other questions how can the
[1:44:24] Foo Spurgeon be washing the blood when
[1:44:25] there's no blood for her it looks like
[1:44:30] to me that this is the bride of Jesus
[1:44:31] Christ and if that's the case then we
[1:44:36] have to go through much tribulation how
[1:44:38] many willing to go through the fire with
[1:44:40] Jesus I'm willing because he promised
[1:44:43] he'd be with me in all my tribulation he
[1:44:45] would comfort me from any trouble he
[1:44:47] promised into it let's see no no song
[1:44:50] I'll go with him through the garden
[1:44:51] praise God I'll go with him through the
[1:44:53] judgment right amen patience and
[1:45:06] patience experience experience he will
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:47] I'll go with into the judgement
[1:47:51] judgement I'll go
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:17] just keep playing that think about that
[1:48:20] church it struck me as I was preaching
[1:48:21] that brother Branham had to go through
[1:48:23] Great Tribulation to be one of those
[1:48:25] Saints and his tribulation was being
[1:48:28] talked bad about being rejected no more
[1:48:32] friends calling them like they used to
[1:48:35] just because he took a stand on God's
[1:48:37] Word God considers that when you're
[1:48:40] alone when you're not liked anymore when
[1:48:44] the people that used to care don't care
[1:48:46] anymore God considers that persecution
[1:48:49] doctors here that tribulation but we
[1:48:51] must not give up we must not compromise
[1:48:54] we must become perfectly holy we must
[1:48:59] perfect holiness in the fear of God now
[1:49:03] see how much we can give up and still
[1:49:05] have the same friends or have more faith
[1:49:08] no see how not see what we can
[1:49:12] compromise on but see what we must
[1:49:15] sacrifice in order to love Christ more
[1:49:20] Neal Church that's one way I know I
[1:49:22] still I'm serving Christ is because I
[1:49:24] still hunger to know his word I still
[1:49:28] thirst to know his word but if you don't
[1:49:32] feel that way please tonight make a
[1:49:35] choice to feel that way
[1:49:38] I want to be more holy well if you do
[1:49:41] you got to make some sacrifice to get
[1:49:43] there you must perfect holiness in the
[1:49:50] fear of God but he said he'd come for me
[1:49:56] in any trouble that I go through praise
[1:49:58] God
[1:50:01] let's just have word of Prayer
[1:50:05] every father you know the hearts of the
[1:50:07] people here nor let our church grow in
[1:50:15] holiness dear God let me grow in
[1:50:20] holiness then each person here hunger
[1:50:23] and thirst for more righteousness may
[1:50:26] each of us think I can live a more
[1:50:28] righteous life by God's grace God wants
[1:50:32] me to live closer to her God doesn't
[1:50:36] want me to play Church now doesn't want
[1:50:39] me to drift along tossed to and fro by
[1:50:42] every wind and wave God wants me to have
[1:50:46] a purpose God has taken me somewhere
[1:50:50] God's with me and I might have to
[1:50:58] separate myself and make sacrifices in
[1:51:02] order to fall more in love with him but
[1:51:04] I'm willing to do it help us Jesus help
[1:51:11] us to be willing to do anything Lord to
[1:51:13] draw closer to you to sacrifice any
[1:51:16] relationship or any financial gain Lord
[1:51:19] whatever might be
[1:51:24] in order to know new law and the power
[1:51:27] your resurrection thank you Lord Lord

[1:52:01] Lord God may you be with us in any

[1:52:10] see our God arise higher than our
[1:52:14] persecution arises thank you Lord for
[1:52:20] such great precious promises the Lord

[2:00:45] call upon you Jesus Heavenly Father sir
[2:01:49] Abba we want to be perfected in holiness
[2:01:55] we want white robes Lord you don't want
[2:01:58] there to be any question where we're
[2:02:00] gonna be at there's a bit of a question
[2:02:02] where does the foolish virgin go but
[2:02:05] without a doubt the bride's roads would
[2:02:08] be washed white we know that's got to be
[2:02:11] her
[2:02:13] because she endured the great
[2:02:15] persecution she adored Great Tribulation
[2:02:20] during her life she got less and less
[2:02:29] popular less and less friends as she
[2:02:32] served just like your prophet just as
[2:02:36] your son Jesus did dear God that didn't
[2:02:40] make her compromise it just washed her
[2:02:45] refined her and made her more holy Lord
[2:02:50] let that happen for Bride of Christ
[2:02:52] fellowship that we might be made more
[2:02:55] hopefully one day we'll take those palms
[2:03:00] morning I don't know how must be eternal
[2:03:02] palms or something we'll be able to wave
[2:03:06] them at the Lamb who sits on his throne
[2:03:10] say blessing honor glory power
[2:03:16] Thanksgiving in mind to our God who sits
[2:03:19] on the throne or I imagine then Lord
[2:03:32] you'll spend some time and you'll wipe
[2:03:33] away these tears from my eyes little
[2:03:38] trials we went through that seemed so
[2:03:40] big to us you'll just heal those old
[2:03:43] memories and wipe away all the tears
[2:03:45] from our eyes Lord then the best part is
[2:03:53] we'll be ever by your side we'll never
[2:03:55] have to leave the side of our safe
[2:04:02] then Lord you'll lead us to fountains of
[2:04:04] living waters we won't be hungry anymore
[2:04:11] what we thirsty take care of all of our
[2:04:17] needs - what a promise
[2:04:24] what a promise thank you Lord Jesus
[2:04:29] so we just say tonight washed our robes
[2:04:32] white with your blood
[2:04:36] then it's overcome by the Word of God
[2:04:40] testimony our testimonies and the blood
[2:04:46] of Jesus Christ bless your people now in
[2:04:50] Jesus Christ Church said Amen god bless
[2:04:53] you Oh
