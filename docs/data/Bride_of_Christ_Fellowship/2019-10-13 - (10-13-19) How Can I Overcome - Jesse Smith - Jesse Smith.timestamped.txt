[32:14] I'm sorry this afternoon I keep saying
[32:16] that let's just read a few texts of
[32:18] Scripture here I like to start at
[32:20] revelation 3:21 I've kind of Hana on my
[32:23] heart lately I've just been listening to
[32:24] how can I overcome this week and so I
[32:27] think I'll just going to preach that
[32:28] message so revelation 3:21 like to
[32:33] preach on how can I overcome many times
[32:44] in my ministry you know when I study the
[32:47] prophets messages
[32:49] normally I'll just study thoughts you
[32:51] know and I'll bounce all around here but
[32:52] every now and then you know the Lord
[32:53] will have me just focus on on one sermon
[32:55] so that's what I kind of felt like this
[32:57] week I mowed the grass Monday and I
[32:59] thought Laura what sermon could I listen
[33:01] to and it just kind of came to my heart
[33:02] with how could I overcome so I just been
[33:05] the studying on that all week and
[33:06] listening to that one and so I like to
[33:08] preach that this morning by God's grace
[33:10] revelation 3:21
[33:19] to
[33:20] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[33:22] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[33:26] sat down with my father in his throne
[33:29] now let's go to James 4:7 I'll just take
[33:35] these two scriptures for a Texas this
[33:37] afternoon James for verse 7 let's all
[33:50] read verse 7 we can read that together
[33:52] James 4:7 let's read that on three one
[33:56] two three submit yourselves therefore to
[33:59] God resist the devil and he will flee
[34:03] from you praise God let's have a word of
[34:05] Prayer
[34:06] everything on your heart just make it
[34:07] known unto the Lord here Heavenly Father
[34:10] we just come reverently this afternoon
[34:12] we're thankful again for your word Lord
[34:14] for this worship that we've been able to
[34:16] experience and give back to you Lord all
[34:19] the praise Lord that you're your do of
[34:22] Lord and we're just happy to give that
[34:24] Lord I pray Lord we read your word now
[34:26] just let your holy spirit have
[34:28] preeminence through my lips Lord and
[34:30] through the ears of the saints O God
[34:32] through their praises and their amens
[34:35] and their hallelujahs as they agree with
[34:37] every word of God we believe Lord let us
[34:40] receive and Lord let us become all that
[34:43] you've called us to become Lord God
[34:45] we're so happy to be called Christians
[34:47] in this hour while we see the world
[34:48] falling apart we see the body of Christ
[34:51] rising up Lord uniting Lord becoming
[34:54] stronger more fervent more sure and Lord
[34:57] that's why we're here to make our
[34:58] calling and election sure that we are
[35:00] the bride of Jesus Christ that we
[35:02] believe every word of God and by your
[35:04] grace will live every word and overcome
[35:06] Satan and every one of his tricks and
[35:08] father we will give you all the glory
[35:09] today as you strengthen us and help us
[35:11] in Jesus Christ's name
[35:13] the church said Amen god bless she's
[35:15] been seated praise God
[35:23] praise the Lord I don't have any
[35:24] slideshow today so I'm sorry I just
[35:27] didn't have time for that but like to
[35:29] preach on this thought here with how can
[35:31] I overcome if you'd like to listen to it
[35:34] it's a two-hour message it was preached
[35:36] on August 25th 63 I find it interesting
[35:39] that morning he preaches how can I
[35:41] overcome and then they have a prayer or
[35:42] they have a healing service that evening
[35:44] with perfect faith and these two go
[35:46] together
[35:47] of course how can overcome than perfect
[35:49] faith because you overcome by faith
[35:51] right because faith is the revelation of
[35:54] the will of God so I want to preach a
[35:56] lot of the thoughts right now this
[35:57] message here and I'll be directing you
[36:00] know our thoughts here to the scriptures
[36:02] as well it's interesting also you know
[36:05] this we the week he preached it how can
[36:07] I overcome and then perfect faith and
[36:09] the next week he preached token and
[36:11] desperations which are they're just
[36:15] foundational messages like you you have
[36:17] to know these messages if you're gonna
[36:19] overcome praise God and of course you
[36:22] can't overcome without the token
[36:24] praise the Lord so what a great group a
[36:28] message that seemed like the Lord was
[36:29] just opening things up after the
[36:31] revelation seven seals there you know
[36:33] March and then a few months later here
[36:35] five months later the Prophet is just
[36:37] pouring out these revelations and that's
[36:40] what is that's what his last commission
[36:42] was right the opening of the word praise
[36:44] God the the third pole so this is part
[36:47] of the third pole this is how we're over
[36:50] comers praise the Lord by the word of
[36:51] God so I won't just wanted to start off
[36:53] with that thought with those scriptures
[36:56] and I want to just go through a few more
[36:59] so in our text was revelation 3:21 and
[37:02] it offers everyone the reward if you are
[37:07] an overcomer we all get the same reward
[37:09] we get to sit with Christ in the throne
[37:12] and brother man makes a statement where
[37:15] even says he says this is in his throne
[37:18] he says in his domain of the kingdom so
[37:23] a lot of us picture you know just we're
[37:24] sitting on a throne but brother man
[37:26] takes it further than that okay we know
[37:29] we will be with Christ in the on the
[37:31] throne we know there must be a very
[37:33] large throne praise God we know at the
[37:36] white throne judgment
[37:37] we'll sit with him in the throne but the
[37:40] Prophet takes us to a greater
[37:41] application he says this means in the
[37:45] throne he says which means also in the
[37:47] domain so the territory of of Christ and
[37:52] he said so with a church be with him in
[37:54] the entire domain
[37:56] he said the boundaries that Christ has
[37:59] given the bride from eternity to
[38:01] eternity in other words once time ends
[38:05] he said will be with him in his domain
[38:08] and then will be with him in his domain
[38:10] for all eternity praise God without end
[38:13] amen so this means more than just
[38:15] sitting one time on a throne like if you
[38:18] one time got to visit the White House
[38:19] you know that's the best way we could
[38:21] see it oh well I got my picture taken
[38:23] with President Obama or President Trump
[38:25] or whoever it is you know you are in the
[38:27] office or you might have been there in
[38:29] the office but this goes beyond that
[38:31] this goes throughout all Christ's entire
[38:34] domain all of eternity praise God so it
[38:38] talks about not just a one-time meeting
[38:42] with Christ but just being with him as
[38:45] the bride amen
[38:47] so that's the opening Scripture and it's
[38:48] all for all overcomers
[38:50] and i want to remind everybody that that
[38:53] the the opportunity and the tools to
[38:56] overcome is freely given to everyone
[38:58] remember jesus said whosoever will let
[39:01] him come and drink of the waters of life
[39:03] so the only thing that's required to be
[39:06] an overcomer is drinking amen
[39:09] right coming to Christ and drinking of
[39:12] the waters of life there in fact there's
[39:14] there's numerous symbols you can give to
[39:16] it that's one of the symbols one of the
[39:18] symbols is you know leaving leaving your
[39:22] slavery right as the the Liberty you
[39:25] know as the Liberty tells us you know
[39:27] the day of Liberty the Day of Atonement
[39:29] you know you're the trumpet sounds and
[39:31] we're set free and and as slaves we can
[39:34] leave our slavery and we can leave that
[39:36] behind and we can come to the waters of
[39:38] life and drink from the waters of life
[39:40] amen
[39:41] that's one symbol praise God but in our
[39:43] in the Bible we're given other symbols
[39:46] praise God
[39:47] we're given the symbol of a warrior in
[39:49] an Ephesians
[39:51] so let's goes back there a very familiar
[39:53] scripture so one symbol is a thirsty a
[39:57] thirsty Saint who's thirsty for living
[40:00] waters that's one symbol all you have to
[40:02] do to overcome is just leave the the
[40:05] sinfulness of the world and come and
[40:07] drink of the pure waters of life another
[40:10] symbol is you must stand like a warrior
[40:13] how many warriors we have in here this
[40:14] afternoon praise God and I just love the
[40:17] the illustration here the Bible gives us
[40:20] a verse ten fusions 610 finally my
[40:23] brethren be strong in the Lord and the
[40:25] power of his might now a lot of people
[40:28] are strong today and money praise God a
[40:30] lot of people are strong today with
[40:32] words right with attitudes they got a
[40:34] strong attitude right a lot of people
[40:37] are strong with their their sports team
[40:40] they're strong in that they really know
[40:42] their team really well right a lot of
[40:44] people are strong with arrogance and
[40:46] pride I'll tell you this this is a real
[40:49] sad story but I'll just tell you how how
[40:51] much the Lord has been dealing with me
[40:52] on this I was teaching Thursday at Bible
[40:55] Club and and one of the girls there was
[40:57] a and I was teaching him I'll have you
[40:59] have to love your family and one of the
[41:02] girls there was adopted by her
[41:03] grandmother and I was showing how Jesus
[41:06] said whoever receives a child in my name
[41:11] receives me so saying anyone that will
[41:14] adopt a child and receive them in the
[41:17] name of Jesus they've received Jesus in
[41:20] other words they have the Spirit of
[41:22] Christ amen and and they pointed out to
[41:25] me the kids went out to me oh this
[41:26] third-grade girl her grandma's here and
[41:28] and she's adopted or nice and I looked
[41:31] at the grandma I said praise the Lord
[41:32] grandma and I said have you two and I'll
[41:35] use the scripture and I said are you
[41:37] doing this for your glory or Jesus's
[41:39] glory and I was trying to get her to say
[41:41] it was for Jesus but here's here's her
[41:45] heart heart I listen it was really sad
[41:47] because it's in front of like 80 kids
[41:49] and you know there's some adults there
[41:50] and I said I just felt led to do I said
[41:53] whose glory are you doing this for your
[41:55] glory or for Jesus glory and she said my
[41:57] glory and she stood there like this like
[42:00] I thought mine it's kind of smiled in
[42:03] front of all these people only
[42:05] I said well okay and so then I read I
[42:09] read another scripture where it said if
[42:11] you receive them in my name and I just
[42:12] felt lad I kind of turned back and said
[42:14] I said grandmother I said but do you
[42:16] receive her and your name or in the name
[42:18] of Christ and she said in the name of
[42:20] Christ and she finally bowed her head
[42:22] and humbled herself but I thought isn't
[42:24] that striking this woman was so mad with
[42:27] and I know the situation that's why I
[42:28] can say this this this mother was this
[42:31] grandmother was so upset with her son
[42:32] her son got arrested for drugs and now
[42:35] and he's in jail and now she has to take
[42:38] care of the daughter but she's so filled
[42:40] with pride that she's that she's taking
[42:42] the daughter for her glory and the
[42:44] presence of all those witnesses she says
[42:46] it's for her glory and see how people
[42:49] wanna they wanna they want to be strong
[42:51] and that's her being strong in herself
[42:53] in other words she's she's saying I'm
[42:55] strong I'm doing this for my glory now
[42:58] thankfully she said at the end it was in
[43:00] the name of Jesus but I don't know I
[43:02] told that I told the friends here we got
[43:04] to pray for this woman amen I got to
[43:06] pray for this woman but see that's an
[43:08] example we got to be strong in the Lord
[43:11] here's an example of a grandmother who's
[43:14] trying to do it brother amen in her own
[43:15] strength but we can't do it in our own
[43:18] strength we can't do anything in our own
[43:20] strength we've got to do everything we
[43:22] do with the strength of Christ in other
[43:25] words you got to go to work you've got a
[43:27] you got to be a husband you've got to be
[43:30] a wife you've got to be a mother father
[43:31] a grandfather grandmother you've got to
[43:34] do that in the strength of Christ amen
[43:36] because the Bible said soldiers of God
[43:39] overcomers of God are strong in the Lord
[43:42] if you and I feel insufficient not
[43:45] obviously she feels insufficient to be a
[43:47] grandmother of her own strength right
[43:49] she feeling but see we know if we feel
[43:52] insufficient about our ability we've got
[43:54] to learn to stop leaning upon our own
[43:56] strength and we've got to be strong in
[43:58] the Lord amen
[43:59] so see you know this example the month
[44:02] the grandmother is trying to overcome
[44:03] with her own strength and she's upset
[44:05] but see you can't you can't serve God by
[44:08] your pride you can't serve even God by
[44:11] fear you can't you can't serve God by
[44:14] your own ability we've all got to accept
[44:16] the power of God and we
[44:18] to overcome and be strong in the Lord
[44:20] and the power of his might
[44:23] that's just I wasn't in my notes but I
[44:25] just kind of came to me just now so I
[44:26] thought I'd share that see be strong in
[44:28] the Lord and the power of his own might
[44:31] verse 11 put on the whole armour of God
[44:34] that ye may able to stand against the
[44:36] wiles of the devil for we wrestle not
[44:40] against flesh and blood but against
[44:41] principalities against powers against
[44:43] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[44:45] against spiritual wickedness in high
[44:47] places
[44:48] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[44:50] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[44:51] in the evil day and having done all to
[44:54] stand now Paul would not just be riding
[44:56] this two foolish virgin Paul's riding
[44:59] this to the wise virgin Paul's riding
[45:01] this two born-again Saints and it gives
[45:03] us the picture of soldiers that the and
[45:07] the imagery here is that a soldier who's
[45:09] born again an overcomer is somebody that
[45:12] will stand and fight and their main
[45:15] objective is just to remain standing if
[45:18] they fall they're going to lose but the
[45:22] imagery here's of a soldier that he
[45:24] stays on his feet
[45:25] and he's willing to stand there and
[45:27] overcome and he does it by the power of
[45:30] his armor amen hallelujah and then the
[45:33] Bible describes the armor is any of the
[45:36] armor your ability Church no youryour
[45:39] breastplate is Christ's righteousness
[45:41] not your own praise God your helmet is
[45:45] not your victory it's Christ's salvation
[45:47] in your life amen
[45:49] all these things that it's not your
[45:51] sword in your hand it's the sword of the
[45:53] word amen
[45:54] so nothing so the imagery one imagery is
[45:58] a thirsty a very thirsty person who goes
[46:01] to the fountain praise God they leave
[46:03] their sinful world behind
[46:04] here's another imagery of an overcomer
[46:07] they have to take on the whole armor of
[46:09] God and they've got to stand against
[46:11] Satan and take on the full armor and
[46:15] then the Bible said in verse 16 above
[46:18] all taking the shield of faith wherefore
[46:21] wherewith you may be able to quench all
[46:23] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[46:26] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[46:28] the Spirit which is the word of God
[46:32] now let me just make a few points on
[46:34] verse 16 the shield of faith and it it
[46:38] blocks every Dart every lie so as Satan
[46:42] shoots at you he's sending fiery darts
[46:44] of Lies and I know about you but
[46:47] whenever I hear something a lie my heart
[46:49] starts beating a lot harder right when
[46:52] you hear a false doctrine or you hear
[46:54] bad news about somebody or you're
[46:56] attempted or even like a temptation will
[46:58] come many times you know our heart start
[47:00] beating a little faster because we know
[47:02] of fiery darts on the way but the Bible
[47:07] says that if we hold up the shield of
[47:09] faith and faith is a revelation if we
[47:12] hold up a shield of faith and the Bible
[47:14] said faith will extinguish every fiery
[47:17] dart praise God in other words when we
[47:21] have a mime and this this means in our
[47:24] minds we're battling is this true should
[47:26] I believe this should I pass this on or
[47:28] not should I accept this should I
[47:29] meditate on this or not we the way to
[47:32] overcome in our mind is to remember what
[47:35] the Word of God says it's by remembering
[47:38] God's Word quoting God's Word believing
[47:41] God's Word and God's Word when you
[47:44] settle down and really believe it and
[47:46] take the word of God instead of the
[47:48] fiery dart it will quench the fire it
[47:51] will make the the temptation leave
[47:53] you'll overcome by the truth that was
[47:56] preached to you the truth you read in
[47:58] your Bible and you will be an overcomer
[48:00] amen
[48:01] hallelujah so this the shield represents
[48:04] the Battle of the mind amen you've got
[48:07] it and we've got to go back and remember
[48:08] no the Bible says this is Satan's lying
[48:11] say one thing in this ear we've got to
[48:13] remember and say the Bible says this
[48:16] praise God the Bible says this this is
[48:18] what faith tells me this is what I've
[48:20] been taught in the scripture this is
[48:21] what God has shown me and by this I'll
[48:24] overcome amen hallelujah
[48:27] verse 17 the helmet of salvation and the
[48:30] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[48:33] God so see there's more intense battles
[48:36] when just the shield of faith won't do
[48:38] it you ever think of that sometimes it
[48:41] feels like how many know like sometimes
[48:43] it seems like the battles you know
[48:45] Satan's far
[48:46] and he's just shooting arrows from afar
[48:47] off in other words the battle feels like
[48:50] well I just got a black these and then I
[48:52] can that can relax a little bit and
[48:53] that's true there are some battles like
[48:55] that but then there's battles where just
[48:58] the the enemy's so near that just the
[49:02] shield won't drive him away right it's
[49:05] not like the enemy's way far off it's
[49:07] like the enemy has come to close
[49:09] quarters and now just believing and just
[49:11] and that's gonna do good but it's gonna
[49:14] take more than that the enemy's so near
[49:17] we've got to drive him back with the
[49:19] Word of God see I think we experience
[49:23] that some battles it seems like the end
[49:25] up that the evil is so much closer than
[49:28] another times sometimes if you like
[49:31] evils knocking right on the door amen
[49:34] sometimes Church the evil is right in
[49:36] the church service sometimes the demons
[49:39] are right here trying to get in people's
[49:41] minds and get them to leave church or
[49:42] something like that right that's how
[49:44] close they feel or sometimes it's so
[49:47] close it's a sickness in your body amen
[49:49] and it's not way far off but it's a it's
[49:52] a sickness right in your body and so
[49:55] when it's that close we've got to take
[49:57] out the Word of God
[49:58] and we've got to fight against that
[49:59] because the enemy is so near and we've
[50:02] got to stand
[50:03] and remember that the weapons that we
[50:05] have are powerful and effective amen God
[50:09] wouldn't give us weapons that wouldn't
[50:10] work or we wouldn't give us weapons that
[50:13] would fail he give us weapons that are
[50:15] great conquering weapons that are very
[50:17] effective they're very strong and we've
[50:19] got to be overcomers and used the
[50:21] weapons that God has given to us hey man
[50:24] hallelujah so this is the the second
[50:28] imagery here the first one's a thirsty
[50:30] beggar who just wants water and they
[50:32] overcome by leaving the things of the
[50:34] world and going to the fountain here the
[50:37] warrior is strong in the Lord and he's
[50:40] got all the armor on he's got the shield
[50:42] of faith the revelations of God word and
[50:44] he's got the Word of God quoting amen
[50:46] now let's go to another one here let's
[50:49] go back to James for in our text James
[50:51] 4:7 this is the groundwork or say the
[50:58] foundational scriptures
[51:00] and brother bear mentions these
[51:01] scriptures of course in the sermon James
[51:05] 4:7 but let's read verse 6 because we
[51:11] got it we have to overcome our pride as
[51:13] well how many can say amen to that
[51:15] sometimes we get prideful we think we
[51:17] can do it on our own well God got to
[51:19] resist us in those those times verse 6
[51:22] but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[51:24] saith God resists the proud but he gives
[51:27] grace unto the humble remember Paul said
[51:30] I'm laboured more because the grace that
[51:31] was with me
[51:32] that means Paul was a very humble person
[51:34] and of course God helped him be humble
[51:37] because he game that I trouble right off
[51:39] and on he'd have that I trouble
[51:41] sometimes he get healed sometimes he get
[51:42] sick again
[51:43] so God was using that to keep him humble
[51:45] but God resists the proud and he gives
[51:48] grace to the humble verse 7 submit
[51:50] yourselves therefore to God
[51:52] now that means obey that means to
[51:55] surrender we have to obey and surrender
[51:58] God's Word and then the Bible said
[52:01] that's resisting the devil and he will
[52:04] flee from you see that picture there so
[52:06] the picture is sometimes here you know
[52:08] the enemy's far away and just blocking
[52:10] you know the the fiery darts of lies but
[52:14] then there's times where Satan and the
[52:15] demons come so close that we got to be
[52:18] able to fight him one-on-one oh but
[52:21] really even if there's one of them it's
[52:23] never really one on one it's one on two
[52:25] amen hallelujah because it's not just me
[52:29] and you because greater is He that's in
[52:31] you then he that's in the world amen
[52:34] it's never one-on-one praise God unless
[52:37] you want to try to fight him with your
[52:38] own mind amen or your own ability
[52:41] because he resists that but see he'll
[52:43] fight with you it's really never
[52:45] one-on-one because God said I'll never
[52:47] leave you nor forsake you amen because
[52:50] you're his children and he loves you he
[52:52] wouldn't do that and of course he wants
[52:55] you to learn how to fight and he does
[52:57] teach us but he never leaves us amen
[52:59] because the Bible said resist the devil
[53:01] he'll flee so like we know it Jesus will
[53:04] get to that you know maybe next week by
[53:06] God's grace but Jesus when he fought
[53:08] Satan he fought so hard for three major
[53:11] assaults program calls that made
[53:13] assaults and then finally after a third
[53:16] time Satan left for a season right and
[53:19] that's and that's what I was mentioning
[53:21] earlier some of these fights are gonna
[53:23] feel like my it's just this is an
[53:25] intense spiritual battle this is a
[53:27] harder battle than other times and we've
[53:30] got to recognize that and we got to be
[53:32] able to quote the Word of God and obey
[53:34] the Word of God submit to God in those
[53:37] hours and keep fighting until the enemy
[53:40] has to flee praise the Lord and this is
[53:44] spiritual warfare we'd say right this is
[53:47] the overcomer this is how can I overcome
[53:49] now a great summary is in John the
[53:52] Gospel of John chapter 1 verse 12 and 13
[53:55] a great summary this is a beautiful
[53:58] summary here and this works when you get
[54:01] born again but it also works as you
[54:03] receive revelation John 1:12 and 13 john
[54:19] 1:12 but as many as received him now
[54:25] notice the order here as many as
[54:28] received him to them gave he power to
[54:31] become the sons of God even to them that
[54:35] believe on his name which were born now
[54:39] here's where it speaks to the new birth
[54:40] not of blood nor the will of flesh nor
[54:45] of the will of man but of God praise God
[54:49] so this goes back to your predestination
[54:51] God foreknew that you would love
[54:54] righteousness and you would surrender
[54:56] your free more agency to him so he
[54:58] called you and elected and then God
[55:00] ordains the time and place and season
[55:03] where you live and then he ordained your
[55:05] birth day men natural and spiritual
[55:08] praise God but notice the the order this
[55:11] is beautiful when you receive him then
[55:14] he gives you power to become amen so
[55:18] receive and then you become so I kind of
[55:21] look at like this you believe you
[55:23] receive and then you become praise God
[55:27] you believe it right you believe the
[55:29] gospel you got saved you got baptized
[55:31] you received him praise God you receive
[55:33] more of the word and then you become the
[55:35] word amen hallelujah you got to believe
[55:39] it first you got to repent and believe
[55:41] it then you start receiving more of the
[55:44] promises of God and then you become a
[55:46] real warrior a real overcomer amen and
[55:49] the overcomer is one who's born again
[55:52] hallelujah praise God so I want to lay
[55:57] that in now all these scriptures
[55:58] together revelation 3:21 Ephesians 6
[56:01] James 4:7 and John 1 if you place many
[56:04] of these if you place all these together
[56:06] you get the groundwork for an overcomer
[56:09] this is the foundation of how you
[56:11] overcome you've got to stand and resist
[56:14] him and there's times you have to quote
[56:15] the Word of God to drive him back and if
[56:18] you do that you'll remain standing for
[56:20] the faith praise God you won't fall away
[56:23] you'll stand for the faith amen and
[56:25] you'll be an overcomer because you're
[56:27] born again oh thank the Lord amen I
[56:31] remember brother and said Jesus was
[56:33] tempted above any man that could ever be
[56:36] tempted brother am says that so we know
[56:39] that Jesus in his temptation in Matthew
[56:41] 4 we're not going to go there yet but
[56:42] that was the greatest temptation could
[56:45] ever be on a man because Jesus had all
[56:48] the power and Satan tempted him to use
[56:50] his power
[56:51] Jesus had all the authority he was going
[56:54] to get it but Satan tried to tempt him
[56:56] and take it early before it was God's
[56:58] time and that's a great temptation for
[57:00] you and I isn't it how many know that
[57:03] the Holy Ghost is a spirit of adoption I
[57:05] mean know that and how many how many
[57:07] want to be adopted where we're like well
[57:09] Bram says your name on the check is as
[57:12] good of the father's in other words how
[57:14] many people want to see God do miracles
[57:16] through them how many people want to see
[57:18] the Holy Spirit surged through them and
[57:20] do great things see we all want that
[57:23] right we all want that I want it we all
[57:25] want that but see we gotta learn to wait
[57:27] on that for God's timing so see that
[57:30] great temptation where Satan says throw
[57:32] yourself down the Angels will bear you
[57:34] up he's quoting a psalms right he's
[57:36] quoting the word we'll see jesus had the
[57:38] character to know that I don't
[57:40] do what Satan wants me to do when Satan
[57:43] wants me to do it I do what God wants me
[57:45] to do when God wants me to do it and
[57:47] church that's what we're talking about
[57:49] for us that's the the great lessons we
[57:51] can learn from we all know there's going
[57:53] to be a rapture amen
[57:54] we all know the bride is going to be
[57:56] without spot or blemish we all know
[57:58] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[57:59] we all know there's a latter in coming
[58:01] and it's tough saith the Lord but we
[58:03] gotta wait and patiently and be in the
[58:05] right position and grow in grace and
[58:07] knowledge of the Lord and let the spirit
[58:09] of adoption teach us and train us so
[58:11] that we don't get ahead of God but we
[58:13] stay in - with the Holy Spirit amen
[58:16] hallelujah because we've all seen this
[58:18] people jump in trying to make make
[58:20] guesses about when the rapture is gonna
[58:22] happen
[58:22] some said 2006 I remember that some said
[58:25] 2015 some said 2018 19 see what are they
[58:29] trying to do they're getting they're
[58:31] letting Satan tempt them to try to make
[58:33] something happen about the rapture to
[58:35] realize that every time they predict and
[58:37] make a prediction they're trying to
[58:39] scare people to get them ready we don't
[58:41] need someone to scare us ready we need
[58:43] the Holy Spirit to help us love and love
[58:46] God and be so close to God that Jesus
[58:48] gets us ready amen I don't need a man to
[58:51] get me to get ready I need Christ to
[58:53] make me ready see that's what that is
[58:56] all that is is a modern satanic
[58:58] temptation where toss yourself down from
[59:01] from the pinnacle the modern form of
[59:03] that is predict the rapture try to make
[59:05] yourself something like your
[59:07] supernatural try to make it happen and
[59:09] church none of us are gonna make it
[59:10] happen
[59:11] it's Christ that's gonna make it happen
[59:12] amen now let's look now I want to go
[59:18] right to some direct quotes here from
[59:19] this sermon is such a wonderful sermon
[59:21] if you haven't listened to a while I
[59:22] want you to listen to it if you get a
[59:24] chance how can I overcome because it's a
[59:27] real blessing now I want to start with
[59:30] this brother Ram starts the sermon by
[59:33] mentioning the Laodicean Church age
[59:35] because his tax is revelation 3:21 about
[59:38] sitting in the throne over comers now he
[59:43] says this he makes a point he says he
[59:45] said Laodicea needed a rebuke they were
[59:48] indifferent towards Christ and he said
[59:52] that was Christ's love
[59:54] christ was put out of the church but his
[59:57] love brought him back
[59:59] knocking trying to get back in so
[1:00:02] program notices Jesus is great love its
[1:00:06] Jesus's Church but the churches kicked
[1:00:09] him out right and now he's trying to get
[1:00:13] back in can you imagine if your spouse
[1:00:14] kicked you out of the house but then you
[1:00:17] and love you know come knock back and
[1:00:20] say can I come back in uh what uh what a
[1:00:24] great one of amount of love that would
[1:00:26] be if you're kicked out and scorned and
[1:00:28] they don't like you but then you come
[1:00:30] back and say honey can I get back in
[1:00:32] please
[1:00:33] I love you let me in let's talk this
[1:00:36] over that's love brother Ram says now
[1:00:40] notice he says Jesus said he that
[1:00:44] overcometh and program says notice not
[1:00:46] she that overcometh but he that
[1:00:49] overcometh and brother sambara has
[1:00:52] noticed this he's not calling the entire
[1:00:54] church back all the denominations and
[1:00:57] things
[1:00:57] he's calling individuals amen he that
[1:01:03] overcometh so see this is this is not
[1:01:06] going to be a worldwide revival like all
[1:01:09] the denominations think and all the all
[1:01:11] the mega churches think where they're
[1:01:12] predicting billions of people being
[1:01:14] saved and and all that a return of
[1:01:16] America to Christ we know that's not
[1:01:18] gonna happen because jesus said he that
[1:01:21] overcometh right open the door I'm
[1:01:23] knocking on his heart and my man said
[1:01:25] it's the individual it's not the group
[1:01:28] and church if we if we're sensitive to
[1:01:30] the Holy Spirit we can hear Christ
[1:01:32] calling our voice our individual name
[1:01:35] amen
[1:01:36] he's calling our name and so we got to
[1:01:39] respond in other words we don't wait for
[1:01:41] other people to respond and I hope
[1:01:43] that's your attitude as you as we learn
[1:01:45] to come to churches and love God more
[1:01:46] faithfully in the years and months to
[1:01:49] come of God Terry's that we don't wait
[1:01:51] for others to move that we can be
[1:01:52] sensitive enough to be led by the Holy
[1:01:54] Spirit that we can be moved and hear
[1:01:57] Christ calling our voice that's what I
[1:02:00] was guilty of for many years in
[1:02:01] denominations I wait so other people
[1:02:04] felt letting the Holy Spirit to go up to
[1:02:06] the altar or wait
[1:02:07] for other people I said well if this
[1:02:09] just happened then I'll get saved that
[1:02:11] was the wrong attitude the right
[1:02:13] attitude is when I hear his voice
[1:02:15] I will not harden my heart amen today if
[1:02:18] you hear his voice harden not your heart
[1:02:20] Amen but learn to respond to the
[1:02:23] individual call that's what the
[1:02:25] overcomer does the overcomer doesn't
[1:02:27] wait for other people the overcomer
[1:02:29] hears the voice and responds to Christ's
[1:02:31] voice now the next thought is he takes
[1:02:34] this this idea of Dodi so if you've
[1:02:40] heard the word Dodi LaRon takes about
[1:02:41] ten minutes and he he mentions how this
[1:02:44] church age is dou T it means rotten
[1:02:47] it means rotten doubt it means weak and
[1:02:52] lacking life and he says I've heard it
[1:02:55] say that so many times that God is a
[1:02:57] good God he said but they say it so much
[1:03:01] that God is like a Dodi grandfather and
[1:03:04] lets his grandchildren do whatever they
[1:03:06] want and never corrects him he said God
[1:03:10] is a father but he's a father of
[1:03:12] righteousness and love is corrective but
[1:03:17] I've said a real mother corrects her
[1:03:19] children a real father corrects their
[1:03:23] children amen
[1:03:25] but Ram said what made him think of this
[1:03:27] Dodi thought about Laodicea he was down
[1:03:29] in a holler or like a valley in the
[1:03:33] woods and he was gonna cross a stream
[1:03:35] and he jumped on the log he said it
[1:03:38] looked good but he stepped on it and
[1:03:41] then a big chunk broke off and he said
[1:03:43] that's the way a lot of Christians are
[1:03:45] becoming he said they're dead in sins
[1:03:49] and trespasses they can hold no weight
[1:03:53] at all think about this can you hold the
[1:03:55] armour of God amen
[1:03:56] without getting weak amen
[1:04:00] they can hold no weight at all overcome
[1:04:03] means to keep life in you he said it
[1:04:07] made that log worse than ever to be in
[1:04:10] the water because it wasn't attached to
[1:04:12] life amen
[1:04:14] so because it wasn't attached to life it
[1:04:17] rotted out and they got weak and old and
[1:04:20] don't
[1:04:21] and it couldn't hold forth anyway now
[1:04:24] say like this it wouldn't bring forth
[1:04:26] any fruit amen he said like Christians
[1:04:30] can get rejoiced one day but then get
[1:04:31] dhoti he said Christians should live
[1:04:34] constantly in the life of Christ he said
[1:04:37] if you lay around and know the things
[1:04:39] you're supposed to do and don't do it
[1:04:41] it's sin
[1:04:42] he said don't lay around and get dodi or
[1:04:45] rotten now let's pour plenty Paul I'm
[1:04:48] sorry okay no Lidia I forget which
[1:04:50] ones back there James 4:17 pull this one
[1:04:53] up here here's the scripture that he
[1:04:54] quotes now when he says this he says
[1:04:58] James 4:17 he says therefore to him that
[1:05:02] knoweth to do good and doeth it not to
[1:05:05] him it is sin now here's the trouble
[1:05:08] with the message with with our humanity
[1:05:11] we hear so much truth we hear more truth
[1:05:15] than any other churches in the world I
[1:05:17] believe that with all my heart because
[1:05:19] no other churches go as deep in the Word
[1:05:21] of God as church as our churches do and
[1:05:23] that's because God sent us a prophet I
[1:05:25] know I was raised in a better culture
[1:05:27] Church and we never even scratch the
[1:05:29] surface of what I preach now never not
[1:05:32] even close and we're not saying that
[1:05:34] pridefully but that's just how it is
[1:05:36] because you can't understand the
[1:05:37] mysteries of God unless God sends you a
[1:05:40] prophet and that to reject the prophet
[1:05:43] is to reject the deepness of the
[1:05:44] revelation but see we hear so much and
[1:05:47] let me just give some examples about
[1:05:49] paying our tithes right about coming to
[1:05:52] church about worshiping God about
[1:05:54] reading our Bibles and having a prayer
[1:05:56] life and seeking God and fasting and
[1:05:59] praying I preach so much on those and
[1:06:01] every preacher should let's see if we
[1:06:04] know that we're not doing it and we
[1:06:06] should do it it actually turns into sin
[1:06:10] because we have to live the word that we
[1:06:13] know and when we live the word that we
[1:06:15] know it gives us life but if we reject
[1:06:18] the word that we know and don't do the
[1:06:21] word that we know then it comes a sin to
[1:06:23] us and we start dying away from our
[1:06:25] first love praise God brother have said
[1:06:30] strive with all that's in you to stay in
[1:06:33] the life of Christ to be
[1:06:35] fruit-bearing at church you and brother
[1:06:37] man says you and I all have this we all
[1:06:40] have this thing inside of our heart that
[1:06:41] gets thirsty that long that hungers for
[1:06:45] life and we all can know when we feel
[1:06:48] like we're dying right Church like this
[1:06:52] morning you know whether you feel like
[1:06:54] you're growing and more the life of God
[1:06:55] or you know if you felt like you've been
[1:06:57] dying this week I don't have to tell you
[1:07:00] if I have to tell you then you're really
[1:07:02] spiritually blind amen but if you love
[1:07:05] God and God's in your heart you should
[1:07:07] know do you feel live like you're
[1:07:09] growing in life or do you feel like
[1:07:10] you're falling away because you can't
[1:07:13] say the same
[1:07:13] we're either attached to the life of God
[1:07:15] over a not attached the life of God and
[1:07:18] so see we've got too long and strive to
[1:07:21] stay in the life of God now what I'm
[1:07:23] talking about here is not the soul if
[1:07:26] you're born if you're born again then we
[1:07:29] know that you're sealed to the day of
[1:07:30] your Redemption I'm talking about in
[1:07:32] your human mind if we give our thinking
[1:07:35] more to the things of the world and we
[1:07:37] don't have fiery darts and we feel weak
[1:07:41] and we feel bloodied and we feel a
[1:07:42] wounded and we don't feel strong in the
[1:07:45] faith we feel like we're wounded
[1:07:47] Christians right but we've got to be
[1:07:49] able to let the balm of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:51] be applied to our wounds confess our
[1:07:54] faults draw near to God get healed and
[1:07:57] start living again in our mind amen
[1:08:00] hallelujah that's right church that's
[1:08:03] right hallelujah because we're all
[1:08:07] guilty of times of laying around and not
[1:08:09] doing what we should do for Greece
[1:08:10] praise God I don't think I'm the only
[1:08:14] one that ever feels like oh I'm not
[1:08:16] living as close to God as I should I
[1:08:18] need to live closer to God see we have
[1:08:21] to feel that and this is the idea he
[1:08:25] starts with this later see in church
[1:08:27] Aegeus dodi it gets weak it can't handle
[1:08:31] the call of God it lays around and
[1:08:35] doesn't do anything the Bible said we if
[1:08:37] we abide in his word and bite in Christ
[1:08:40] then he said ask what you will and it
[1:08:42] shall be done uh-huh praise God what a
[1:08:46] blessing for us amen
[1:08:47] if we
[1:08:48] stay attached in the life of God so
[1:08:52] remember that James 4:17 to him that
[1:08:54] know what to do good and doeth and not
[1:08:56] to him it's sin praise God
[1:09:03] now he says Laodicea is a great age
[1:09:08] because we're so close to the Millenium
[1:09:10] in other words this age time will cease
[1:09:12] soon for this age you know we'll go from
[1:09:15] man's day to the Lord's Day we know that
[1:09:17] and after the judgments that will break
[1:09:19] into the Millennium but he also says
[1:09:21] it's a great age for sin Christians in
[1:09:24] the past ages had to be beheaded just
[1:09:27] for claiming to be a Christian right
[1:09:30] but now the enemy comes in the name of
[1:09:33] Jesus before to name the name of Jesus
[1:09:36] you get killed but now the enemy comes
[1:09:39] in the name of Jesus but Jesus said
[1:09:43] thank God in Matthew 24:24 it would
[1:09:46] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:09:48] possible that's a big if and that means
[1:09:50] the elected a men but RAM says see
[1:09:54] people today they can live above smoking
[1:09:57] and gambling and drinking and adultery
[1:10:00] and still not be an overcomer because
[1:10:04] they've got a religious spirit right and
[1:10:07] they can live over those they can live
[1:10:09] above those things and still not be an
[1:10:11] overcomer still not living all the Word
[1:10:13] of God that's right praise the Lord
[1:10:19] a brother makes a great statement here I
[1:10:22] like this this was a really good thought
[1:10:24] I hadn't really thought about program
[1:10:27] said and never in any age was the
[1:10:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost available like
[1:10:33] it is today with all the revelation that
[1:10:36] we have think about that the seven seals
[1:10:38] marriage and divorce the church ages we
[1:10:41] know all these mysteries the twelve
[1:10:43] mysteries we know the mysteries he said
[1:10:46] never before was it made known but it's
[1:10:48] so it's so sad that in the day in the
[1:10:52] age when everything is made known this
[1:10:54] is the age when Christ is kicked out of
[1:10:58] the church because they don't agree with
[1:11:00] the word that's been
[1:11:01] amen well they said they'll call it
[1:11:05] telepathy so obviously he's referring to
[1:11:07] his ministry the very ministry that
[1:11:10] could make them an overcomer
[1:11:12] they talked evil of it and they say
[1:11:14] telepathy or like my friends will say
[1:11:16] well he's a false prophet or he's not a
[1:11:18] prophet he was a good man but he had to
[1:11:20] get the healing but not a prophet oh if
[1:11:23] only they'd read the Word of God amen
[1:11:25] when they'd pray and get the spirit of
[1:11:27] revelation and see that but see in the
[1:11:29] very age when Christ is available to
[1:11:33] come in fully they kick him out so we
[1:11:38] know it's going to be a battle Satan's
[1:11:39] going to battle us Church to try not to
[1:11:42] let Christ come in all the way but we
[1:11:44] got a flow or we got to fling open every
[1:11:46] door and say Jesus come in we've got to
[1:11:49] separate ourselves from anything in the
[1:11:51] world
[1:11:51] and we got open every window let Jesus
[1:11:53] come in you got to open every door not
[1:11:56] Jesus come in we got to let Jesus fully
[1:11:58] come into our lives and this church amen
[1:12:01] say Lord whatever you'd want me to do
[1:12:03] have your way whatever my calling in
[1:12:06] life is whatever my purpose is and
[1:12:08] that's why we're doing those special
[1:12:09] meetings so we'll take some specific
[1:12:10] time to set aside to pray and seek God
[1:12:14] and hear the word and ask God to show us
[1:12:16] our specific purposes so that we can
[1:12:19] know what God wants us to do that's all
[1:12:22] my heart and I find it that when we pray
[1:12:27] and fast that's when our the hand the
[1:12:29] Lord the Bible says upon us now it can
[1:12:32] be other times of course we know that
[1:12:33] like bro BAM said he would pray in fast
[1:12:35] he would fast like uh he said like a
[1:12:38] Friday Saturday and then like have it
[1:12:40] like a little if the service was on
[1:12:42] Sunday he would fast Friday and then
[1:12:44] take a little bit on Saturday so we had
[1:12:46] a little strapped ranked and then eat a
[1:12:47] little bit on Sunday so just to give you
[1:12:50] an idea how he would fast if he was
[1:12:52] preaching and he needed some physical
[1:12:53] strength to take on the missions and do
[1:12:55] the prayer line he would fast a couple
[1:12:57] days in the week and he said he said
[1:12:58] Friday's my fast day team ever that were
[1:13:00] those day he said Friday's my fast day
[1:13:02] if he's got to preach on Sunday and he's
[1:13:04] got to see visions he wouldn't eat
[1:13:06] Friday but then Saturday he have a
[1:13:07] little bit of meal here a little
[1:13:08] sandwich something really liked she had
[1:13:10] enough strength now if he had to do that
[1:13:12] to serve his purpose in life what about
[1:13:14] you and I church
[1:13:15] Oh what about you and I we got to be
[1:13:19] willing to sacrifice remember the core -
[1:13:21] oh brother bear said not so much your
[1:13:22] money you got to be able to sacrifice
[1:13:24] your time if we want to see God working
[1:13:28] in our lives and find our purpose in
[1:13:30] life we got to be willing to sacrifice a
[1:13:33] little more praise God hallelujah this
[1:13:37] is the age when Christ wants to come in
[1:13:38] fully not so the Prophet said the Holy
[1:13:50] Spirit is rebuking this age that put
[1:13:52] Christ out of the church so how can I
[1:13:55] overcome he starts with this age this
[1:13:57] age it needs a rebuke from the Lord amen
[1:13:59] Jesus rebukes the aged and then the
[1:14:02] Prophet goes into this thought he
[1:14:04] injects his thought he said a minister
[1:14:06] asked him a question he said how can you
[1:14:09] put the bride in the rapture before the
[1:14:13] tribulation program said I like this man
[1:14:16] he wasn't a pushover
[1:14:18] who has to agree with everything you say
[1:14:22] praise God
[1:14:23] look around like this man because you
[1:14:26] just didn't believe everything he said
[1:14:27] like a lot of people say well I believe
[1:14:29] everything brother Bram said right now
[1:14:34] you should say everything the Bible says
[1:14:36] I believe it and we should say yes we
[1:14:38] believe almost everything brother
[1:14:39] Branham said but not his own human
[1:14:41] thoughts that maybe aren't in the Bible
[1:14:43] right everything brother Graham preached
[1:14:45] from the word we believe it but if it's
[1:14:48] just his thoughts you know some things
[1:14:50] that maybe turn out later just beyond
[1:14:51] his own opinions well then we don't
[1:14:53] believe every word like that that's the
[1:14:55] balance of being a Holy Ghost field
[1:14:57] Christian you rightly divide the word of
[1:14:58] God but better him said like a man like
[1:15:01] that who's not a pushover and has to
[1:15:04] agree with everything you say he said I
[1:15:08] believe the bride does not need to go
[1:15:10] through the tribulation because she's
[1:15:12] already purified before the rapture and
[1:15:15] he quotes John 5:24 let's read that
[1:15:19] liddie can you pull up John I'm sorry
[1:15:20] Casey can you vote it boy you're
[1:15:21] switching on me okay
[1:15:22] make us you're on paying attention John
[1:15:25] 5:24
[1:15:31] so brother him quotes the scripture to
[1:15:34] show that the bride is already purified
[1:15:36] and forgiven before the rapture verily
[1:15:41] verily I say unto you he that heareth my
[1:15:42] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:15:44] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[1:15:46] into condemnation see there's no
[1:15:48] judgment but has passed from death unto
[1:15:49] life leave that up there at little for a
[1:15:51] bit a little bit acacia see sir program
[1:15:53] says the the bride does not need to go
[1:15:56] through the tribulation to be purified
[1:15:58] she's already purified she's not under
[1:16:02] condemnation she's not living in the
[1:16:05] death of the sin
[1:16:06] she's got eternal life amen she's born
[1:16:09] again
[1:16:10] she has no condemnation through the
[1:16:12] blood of Jesus Christ and the man says
[1:16:17] well then brother Ram give me a type of
[1:16:18] it give me a type now go to Matthew
[1:16:22] 27:51 acacia but ma'am said sure I'll be
[1:16:26] happy to give you time he said
[1:16:27] everything has to tight because the
[1:16:28] Bible says the law was a shadow of
[1:16:31] things to come everything has a type
[1:16:34] anything we believe should have a type
[1:16:39] Matthew 27:51 program says see the Old
[1:16:44] Testament ended when the veil was torn
[1:16:47] because the veil kept people out from
[1:16:49] the holiest of holies but when God
[1:16:51] ripped the veil from top to bottom God
[1:16:53] was saying brother Jesse you come on in
[1:16:55] amen
[1:16:56] you same van come on in it's open to you
[1:16:58] hallelujah the veil sword come on in not
[1:17:01] stay out stay out stay out he said but
[1:17:03] come right on in amen that's what he was
[1:17:05] saying so the New Testament started
[1:17:07] right there when the sin debt was paid
[1:17:09] and man's welcomed in the presence of
[1:17:12] God amen the old the veil of the temple
[1:17:15] was rent in twain from top to the bottom
[1:17:17] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[1:17:19] rent verse 52 here it is right here so
[1:17:23] here's our program says I'm proving that
[1:17:25] the bride doesn't have to go through the
[1:17:27] tribulation but this man is like well
[1:17:30] the Bible says the righteous have to go
[1:17:32] through tribulation and the man's right
[1:17:33] but he's referring to the foolish virgin
[1:17:35] not the bride Amen so this is our
[1:17:39] brother improves it and this is how I
[1:17:41] proved it
[1:17:41] on the video the last video made was
[1:17:43] wise and foolish merchants I don't know
[1:17:44] if you saw it but I go through all down
[1:17:47] through the whole Bible you can show you
[1:17:48] can show why some Lewis version in every
[1:17:50] age every age has 'm and this is proof
[1:17:54] and this is where the Holy Spirit
[1:17:55] directed me when I wrote that script out
[1:17:57] and the graves were open and all of them
[1:18:00] know all the Old Testament Saints
[1:18:04] resurrected know many of them not all of
[1:18:08] them why not all of them because all
[1:18:11] were not ready for the resurrection amen
[1:18:14] now all of them brother bang met God's
[1:18:16] requirement for the resurrection sea but
[1:18:20] we can meet it by being justified
[1:18:22] sanctified and baptized with the Holy
[1:18:24] Ghost we can meet God's requirements for
[1:18:26] the resurrection amen
[1:18:28] hey man see many not all many of the
[1:18:32] bodies the Saints which arose so we know
[1:18:34] job was there right job said I know my
[1:18:37] redeemer lives and I'll see him in this
[1:18:39] body though the the worms eat this flesh
[1:18:42] yet in this flesh I shall see God amen
[1:18:44] he knew the worms are you gonna eat his
[1:18:47] skin but then that's the ground without
[1:18:48] to give that up again a man in this
[1:18:53] flesh I shall see God Abraham had to be
[1:18:56] there praise God
[1:18:57] Daniel had to be there because Daniel
[1:19:00] Daniel wrote about it the Bible said
[1:19:02] that Daniel he said to us let's read it
[1:19:05] Daniel 1213 Keysha praise God
[1:19:14] 12:13 this one belle reve says better
[1:19:16] and said Daniel made it there see
[1:19:19] because we all have a lot huh me know
[1:19:21] that we all have a lot in life
[1:19:22] you're either standing in one of four
[1:19:25] lots and that's all about this parking
[1:19:28] lot that's where you parked but that's
[1:19:29] not the lot I'm talking about here
[1:19:31] there's a lot of the wise virgin or the
[1:19:33] foolish virgin or the make believer or
[1:19:35] the unbeliever thank God we can stand in
[1:19:38] the save lot amen and if we are born
[1:19:41] again then we are in the wise lot a man
[1:19:44] not the foolish lot Lydia Sarkissian
[1:19:47] bored up there Daniel 12 13 when you get
[1:19:50] a chance so this is what brother Branham
[1:19:51] quotes he said Daniel was there Daniel
[1:19:54] was an overcomer in his day hey man and
[1:19:57] how do you overcome Church by the blood
[1:19:59] and by his prayer life he said I'm not
[1:20:04] eating that Kings meat I'm not eating
[1:20:07] that contaminated food am i I'm going to
[1:20:09] live holy and separate even though it's
[1:20:10] available to me even though all these
[1:20:12] luxuries are available I'll turn them
[1:20:14] down because they'll defile my faith and
[1:20:17] we've got to turn down certain luxuries
[1:20:19] in life in order not to have our faith
[1:20:21] defiled like but like one man says is
[1:20:25] like TV like cable right that's
[1:20:29] something we could have but it's wiser
[1:20:30] to turn it down I'm not saying you
[1:20:33] couldn't have it but I'm saying it's
[1:20:34] wise to turn it down and turn and stay
[1:20:37] away from it it's a luxury you could
[1:20:39] have but everybody I everybody I see
[1:20:42] that gets it falls away why is that the
[1:20:44] case amen
[1:20:45] why is that the case best even every
[1:20:47] person I see that I've seen coat of this
[1:20:49] church and get cable in their home they
[1:20:51] fall away everyone yeah everyone now
[1:20:58] some of them still hang around the
[1:20:59] churches but their lives don't look
[1:21:01] wholly like they ought to and they fall
[1:21:04] away out of their service for God and
[1:21:06] they stop doing things they used to they
[1:21:08] stop living the Holy Light they ought to
[1:21:09] but most of them actually just fall down
[1:21:11] a church all together I'll name him T if
[1:21:14] you want not now about names you later
[1:21:16] her now look he said but go thy way to
[1:21:18] the end be for thou shalt rest I like
[1:21:21] that he's resting Abraham's bosom oh he
[1:21:24] didn't have to be in the heat of the the
[1:21:26] flames he was just rest in there in the
[1:21:27] bosom
[1:21:28] and you look he'll stand in thy lot at
[1:21:31] the end of days program said this is
[1:21:34] Daniel Daniel was resurrected after
[1:21:37] Jesus resurrected he was one of those
[1:21:39] Saints that lived the four Word of God
[1:21:41] he was sincere
[1:21:42] he was an overcomer and so he got the
[1:21:44] stand with Jesus on the earth and that
[1:21:46] day hallelujah
[1:21:50] some of our majors on this many of the
[1:21:53] Saints rose not all Siebel never said
[1:21:57] the Old Testament group who made the
[1:21:59] sacrifices he said some of them made
[1:22:01] them but he said they actually had to
[1:22:04] make them in sincerity and church that's
[1:22:07] the thing today we got to come to church
[1:22:09] with sincere hearts if something is said
[1:22:13] from the preaching and we're not living
[1:22:15] it we need to sincerely repent and say
[1:22:17] God help me to overcome that's sincerity
[1:22:22] right sincerity is not just hearing it
[1:22:25] say well one day I'll get the victory
[1:22:27] okay what are we gonna do today what
[1:22:29] your plans for today your plans ought to
[1:22:31] be to hear what God says and obey what
[1:22:33] God says Amen that ought to be my plan
[1:22:36] that'll be your plan to be overcomers
[1:22:39] and to let god's spirit have its way in
[1:22:41] our lives
[1:22:43] well RAM said Daniel he says Daniel this
[1:22:46] is the quote was the bride type of
[1:22:48] Israel the bride type in other words in
[1:22:53] Israel there was a bride and then there
[1:22:55] was a foolish virgin and Daniel was the
[1:22:58] wise version type that's what he says he
[1:23:01] said those that are really loving and
[1:23:04] living for Jesus is coming not all
[1:23:08] Israel but the bride type of Israel
[1:23:13] thank the Lord
[1:23:17] see bo-ram said when Jesus rose from the
[1:23:20] dead he says when Jesus appears in the
[1:23:24] sky the church the dead in Christ shall
[1:23:26] rise and those will all be changed in a
[1:23:29] moment the rest of them will know
[1:23:30] nothing about it so see everybody else
[1:23:32] from the foolish version every else will
[1:23:34] miss the rapture remember he said appear
[1:23:38] to those in the city so he's going back
[1:23:39] to Jesus resurrection see the
[1:23:42] sure we'll be like that we'll see each
[1:23:44] other and we'll see them the rest of the
[1:23:49] world won't see them
[1:23:51] it'll be caught away as a secret going
[1:23:53] waiting for that time then returning
[1:23:56] back to the earth for that glorious
[1:23:58] millennium then the thousand years the
[1:24:00] rest of the Dead lived not for a
[1:24:02] thousand years
[1:24:03] praise God amen now I hope that was a
[1:24:08] blessing that's a thought he labored on
[1:24:10] I want to bring that thought to you just
[1:24:12] to prove it there by the scripture the
[1:24:15] Old Testament Saints that Rose is the
[1:24:17] type the Old Testament type of the wise
[1:24:19] and foolish virgin I want everybody to
[1:24:21] see that there because he labored on
[1:24:23] that when people came a gun against him
[1:24:25] and said no the the church has to go
[1:24:26] through tribulation he said let's go
[1:24:27] back to the type Amen see some are more
[1:24:31] sincere than others so Church let's
[1:24:36] check our sincerity today
[1:24:37] you got enough sincerity to come to
[1:24:38] church at a time you don't come to me
[1:24:40] regularly don't regularly come to church
[1:24:41] that's the good sincerity but let's now
[1:24:47] next brother Ram goes through how long a
[1:24:49] member you give me 15 minutes here yeah
[1:24:52] he goes through numerous examples I'll
[1:24:55] just go through a couple and then I got
[1:24:56] two quotes I want to close with here
[1:24:58] give me about 15 more minutes
[1:25:02] well Ram said God has always had over
[1:25:05] comers he's never been without a witness
[1:25:08] someone has overcome in every age and
[1:25:13] RAM starts you know the first one he
[1:25:16] starts with is Noah does that surprise
[1:25:17] you Noah
[1:25:19] he said because Jesus type Noah's day to
[1:25:23] our day remember Luke 17 let's read it
[1:25:27] for anyone unfamiliar that go Luke 17
[1:25:30] and then in case you can put up there
[1:25:33] I'll leave its 28th Luke 17 28 I want to
[1:25:42] give everybody a chance to see that 26
[1:25:45] I'm sorry I was one a couple only Luke
[1:25:47] 17:26
[1:25:53] and that's why you know how many seen
[1:25:55] that noah's ark in kentucky or have
[1:25:56] you've seen that noah's ark in kentucky
[1:25:58] okay hands up that's why that thing is
[1:26:00] so prophetic because it's in america and
[1:26:04] the mark of the beast comes out of
[1:26:06] america praise God and Jesus said as it
[1:26:10] was in the days of Noah
[1:26:12] verse 26 as the one days of Noah so
[1:26:15] shall be in the days of the coming of
[1:26:16] the Son of Man and where the Son of man
[1:26:18] visit brother Jose he was born in
[1:26:20] Kentucky amen right Ehsan a man brother
[1:26:24] Ram was born to manifest the Son of Man
[1:26:26] Jesus amen the gift of discernment right
[1:26:30] the Messiah
[1:26:31] sign they'll say the Lord the last sign
[1:26:34] of the Gentiles came in America so they
[1:26:38] have Noah's Ark only in America
[1:26:41] so in place it could be done with all
[1:26:43] the millions of dollars and the and the
[1:26:45] religious background that America has
[1:26:47] this only place that would do it
[1:26:48] China wouldn't do it Africa when to it
[1:26:51] Israel wouldn't do it it had to be done
[1:26:54] in America because America is the one
[1:26:57] that brings forth the mark of the beast
[1:26:59] cuz she's the Beast out of the land and
[1:27:02] she speaks with the power of the first
[1:27:05] beast which was Imperial pagan Rome see
[1:27:09] it has to be in America he said in
[1:27:12] Noah's time Jesus referred to it as it
[1:27:17] was the days of Noah so shall be the
[1:27:19] days of the son son of man now notice
[1:27:20] verse 27 they didn't eat they drank they
[1:27:23] married wives they were given in
[1:27:25] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[1:27:26] into the ark and the flood came and
[1:27:28] destroyed them all a church we all do
[1:27:32] this right we all eat how am I gonna eat
[1:27:33] today
[1:27:34] how many gonna drink how many got
[1:27:35] married or want to get married someday
[1:27:37] see you got you little ones can put up
[1:27:38] your hands yeah see those girls really
[1:27:40] want to get married amen
[1:27:41] hey I didn't do I when I first came to
[1:27:43] the message I said Lord I want the
[1:27:44] rapture to come but let me get married
[1:27:46] first and God was merciful to me gave me
[1:27:50] about wonderful beautiful life there see
[1:27:53] so there's nothing wrong with that
[1:27:54] brother Graham got married twice yes
[1:27:56] well first wife died so you could get
[1:27:58] married again you know those things see
[1:28:01] those things will never become an idol
[1:28:03] to the believer but Jesus trying to say
[1:28:05] the world got
[1:28:07] caught up on those things they forgot
[1:28:09] about the gathering at the arc amen
[1:28:11] they forgot that the righteous ones if
[1:28:14] you want to be saved
[1:28:16] you've got to be in the ark amen it's
[1:28:19] okay to get married it's okay to eat and
[1:28:20] drink it's okay to to Google that life
[1:28:23] but when the spear says get in the Ark
[1:28:25] we better get in the Ark amen that's
[1:28:29] what they're saying that's what Christ
[1:28:30] is saying here they got so distracted
[1:28:33] with the things of the world they miss
[1:28:35] coming in the ark because it was open to
[1:28:37] everybody so is it today everybody can
[1:28:39] go in the rapture who wants to but only
[1:28:42] the elect will go I read that quote
[1:28:44] where was it last Sunday I finished the
[1:28:45] service with that quote brother man said
[1:28:47] it's your free more agency
[1:28:49] he said if any man wishes to go in the
[1:28:51] rapture they can go right because God is
[1:28:55] not going to turn God's not gonna force
[1:28:57] anybody that doesn't want to go to go in
[1:28:59] the rapture he's not gonna do that so
[1:29:01] he's only gonna let people go in the
[1:29:03] rapture who want to go in the rapture
[1:29:05] well that's the great balance isn't it
[1:29:07] with free more agency and predestination
[1:29:11] he said in the days the end to lubing
[1:29:14] world perhaps mins of people there was
[1:29:16] only I love this he says eight
[1:29:18] overcomers so brother man takes the
[1:29:20] middle portion of this sermon and he
[1:29:22] shows how there was only a small number
[1:29:24] of overcomers in every age he starts
[1:29:27] with eight in the days of Noah now look
[1:29:32] what he says many of them had good
[1:29:34] intentions said someday if things happen
[1:29:36] we'll go in the ark with brother Noah
[1:29:38] cuz he's a fine fella isn't that what
[1:29:41] they say today oh and the rapture gets
[1:29:43] close then we'll get the Holy Ghost like
[1:29:45] brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so
[1:29:47] oh one day we know what it's when I
[1:29:49] really feel God moving then I'll get the
[1:29:51] Holy Ghost and I really come down the
[1:29:53] altar and seek God no you better see God
[1:29:55] today don't put it off Oh someday I'll
[1:29:58] be more faithful like sister so-and-so
[1:30:00] or brother so-and-so let's not put it
[1:30:02] off let's get all of God that we can get
[1:30:04] today praise God see many of them he
[1:30:08] said had good intentions he says if you
[1:30:12] are laying around getting Dodi
[1:30:13] get in the Ark hurry quick because the
[1:30:16] door might close at any time and Eminem
[1:30:19] said there was always an ark
[1:30:20] in God's economy every time there was an
[1:30:22] ark he said a Noah sign in last time now
[1:30:27] this time there's an ark now he said
[1:30:29] it's not a denomination he said the Ark
[1:30:32] is in Romans 8:1 let's read that all you
[1:30:34] Ark people because the Ark is not in
[1:30:38] Kentucky the Ark is right here and then
[1:30:42] the Ark is wherever Christ is amen
[1:30:45] Romans 8:1 let's see the ark could leave
[1:30:48] us I'm gonna get Amen on that the ark
[1:30:51] will leave this church if we reject the
[1:30:53] ark it leaves any Church that rejects it
[1:30:57] we've got to welcome the Holy Spirit say
[1:30:59] let the Holy Spirit come in let God have
[1:31:01] his way let sinners repent lets
[1:31:03] sanctified ones repent and get filled
[1:31:05] let the Holy Ghost have his free way
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:08] we've got to say that or else the Ark
[1:31:11] will leave it'll sail away to some other
[1:31:13] church that's hungry for God we can't
[1:31:16] get Dodi we can't lay around and do
[1:31:18] nothing we got to find what God wants us
[1:31:20] to do and do it for his glory Romans 8:1
[1:31:24] tells the ark did you know this I didn't
[1:31:26] even know this ty listen this this week
[1:31:27] the ark was in Romans 8:1 I didn't even
[1:31:29] know it there is therefore now no
[1:31:32] condemnation that are in the ark glory
[1:31:37] and the Church said there's no
[1:31:41] condemnation and Noah because he was in
[1:31:43] the ark there's no condemnation of Moses
[1:31:47] because he was in the ark amen
[1:31:51] other words he was found the pillar of
[1:31:52] fire see there's no condemnation
[1:31:56] relations to them that are in the ark
[1:31:58] were all baptized into one body in one
[1:32:01] domain of that kingdom one spirit
[1:32:04] baptism he said through them which are
[1:32:07] in Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:32:09] flesh but after the spirit
[1:32:11] there's our Ark today being led by the
[1:32:14] Holy Spirit praise God he said that's
[1:32:20] the only way you overcome it's all that
[1:32:22] is under the shed blood as overcomers
[1:32:24] because you cannot overcome yourself it
[1:32:26] is he that overcomes for you you're
[1:32:29] resting kind like Daniel you're resting
[1:32:30] and he's overcoming for you
[1:32:34] Manderson how will I know then brother
[1:32:36] bran that I'm in there I'm in the arc
[1:32:37] watch what kind of life you're living
[1:32:40] just look around see if it's lived out
[1:32:42] of you automatically or do you have to
[1:32:44] strain and pull see then you're doing it
[1:32:47] but you don't try to do it did you ever
[1:32:50] try yeah now love this
[1:32:52] now this some of you mothers alike and
[1:32:53] every time I dressed my children sister
[1:32:56] Naomi I think about this quote right
[1:32:57] here I got to put clothes like this
[1:32:59] morning out to put Genevieve in her
[1:33:01] clothes
[1:33:01] but Ram said Moran said this living a
[1:33:06] Christian life is like putting a shirt
[1:33:08] on a baby so next time you want to say
[1:33:13] God I want to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:33:14] say god help me help me to let you put
[1:33:18] my arm through the shirt holes how many
[1:33:21] want to be sure whole Christians praise
[1:33:23] God I do well they said it's just like
[1:33:27] putting a little baby's arm in a sleep
[1:33:30] hole he's just up and down and over
[1:33:32] Jenna he does that to me all the time
[1:33:35] I'll try to get her arm into sleeve and
[1:33:36] she'll push out like she'll push out
[1:33:38] through the neck part she's like I got
[1:33:40] my shirt on I got my shirt out I'm like
[1:33:43] no you know I'm thinking brother
[1:33:44] branham's quote I'm thinking just yield
[1:33:46] to me now yield to me she's like oh the
[1:33:50] babies how they flex it they're like
[1:33:51] okay it's out and they're flexing they
[1:33:54] won't move their arm Mike honey you got
[1:33:55] to yield to me yield and that's what the
[1:33:57] Holy Spirit saying today yield to me
[1:33:59] Saints do what I want you to do obey me
[1:34:02] listen to the word you to me and I'll
[1:34:04] use you amen
[1:34:08] see he can't do it put on your coat
[1:34:11] honey ever tried to put a coat on one of
[1:34:12] those children and they just won't put
[1:34:14] their arm in the sleeve he can't do it
[1:34:18] the little arm is up and down and all
[1:34:20] around it takes your steady hand oh how
[1:34:25] glad I am I can just yield my hand to
[1:34:28] father and say Lord Jesus I can't get it
[1:34:31] in there you help me put the coat on me
[1:34:35] I quit trying praise God just let him do
[1:34:41] it now take this back to our scripture
[1:34:43] the Bible said submit yourselves to God
[1:34:48] what does the baby have to do I wish she
[1:34:50] wouldn't fight me so much but she does
[1:34:53] all she has to do is submit to God and
[1:34:55] God will take her hand and push it right
[1:34:58] in that sleeve and then she'll be
[1:35:00] dressed the right way and we all want to
[1:35:02] be dressed in his robes of righteousness
[1:35:03] don't we
[1:35:04] oh my but if the little baby keeps
[1:35:10] trying oh I can do it I can do it
[1:35:12] he's just everywhere he can't do it can
[1:35:16] I get any men's from the moms okay some
[1:35:19] of your dad say Amen - I'll say Amen
[1:35:23] you try to dress them in anything why
[1:35:25] I'm big enough I can do it I got it
[1:35:29] Victoire Genevieve so funny she'll find
[1:35:32] clothes laying on the floor like
[1:35:33] somebody's shirt and she'll put the
[1:35:34] shirt on and so it's like hanging over
[1:35:37] her neck and she's walking around and
[1:35:39] she thinks she's something big and
[1:35:40] special and it's like an adult sized
[1:35:42] t-shirt and she's got a sleeve over her
[1:35:46] head and she's walking around like I'm
[1:35:47] somebody big I'm someone that's how we
[1:35:49] are when we try to do something for God
[1:35:50] without God's leadership for it like
[1:35:54] that was me I was trying to argue with
[1:35:55] my mom mom this programs right you know
[1:35:58] this was years when I first came to
[1:35:59] message and I was literally raising my
[1:36:01] voice and that's what it was I I didn't
[1:36:05] accomplish anything of it other than
[1:36:06] having to go back and say I'm sorry mom
[1:36:08] forgive me I should not have got upset
[1:36:10] and raised my voice it was like a baby
[1:36:12] trying to put on that shirt all by
[1:36:14] itself but you know what I humbled
[1:36:16] myself I know what happened most even a
[1:36:18] year later God opened up brother cams
[1:36:21] eyes and then sister Betsy's eyes to the
[1:36:23] message see I started out that year
[1:36:26] brother hey man I was fighting I thought
[1:36:27] my I can do this I it can just be all me
[1:36:30] but then I had to humble myself and say
[1:36:32] Lord you just use me in other words in
[1:36:35] this case in this case there was Simon
[1:36:36] just used brother Simon instead of
[1:36:40] arguing and fussing about it he said to
[1:36:42] let the Holy Spirit put the arm in there
[1:36:43] and then he's fully then they get to
[1:36:46] then they get God's will he says we just
[1:36:50] have to hold still and let him do it
[1:36:52] just yield to him and say here Lord Here
[1:36:55] I am just let me be nothing I yield you
[1:36:58] put my hand in the right place that's
[1:37:01] the victory
[1:37:02] that's the overcoming the thing that you
[1:37:06] have to do is overcome as yourself your
[1:37:09] idea your thing and surrender yourself
[1:37:13] to him he overcome for you he knows the
[1:37:17] way we don't how many can say many that
[1:37:22] but in Noah's time there was only a
[1:37:24] overcomers and they went in they were
[1:37:26] caught inside how many want to be caught
[1:37:28] inside the rapture let me read this last
[1:37:33] two quotes of them I'll go to my last
[1:37:34] scriptures here he said if you have a
[1:37:40] good intention just be caught inside
[1:37:41] don't struggle not him that willeth or
[1:37:44] him that runneth but God just let God
[1:37:47] yield yourself to him and walk on with a
[1:37:49] perfect satisfied faith that what God
[1:37:52] has promised he's able to perform not
[1:37:55] join one denomination join another run
[1:37:57] to this run of that just yield yourself
[1:37:59] to God and walk with Him peaceful quiet
[1:38:02] not interrupted just keep on walking
[1:38:04] with him
[1:38:06] praise the Lord now next he goes to
[1:38:10] Daniel he said in Daniels now preach
[1:38:11] this maybe next Sunday Daniel only there
[1:38:14] was only four overcomers in Daniels day
[1:38:17] in the days of lot there was only three
[1:38:21] over comers out of Sodom now out of
[1:38:23] Sodom he says in the days of John the
[1:38:27] Baptist there's only I'm so there was
[1:38:29] only six over comers and then he comes
[1:38:33] to our day now let's stand to our feet
[1:38:34] and I want us to read two more quotes I
[1:38:37] will proudly read these over and over
[1:38:39] again here because we want to be
[1:38:41] overcomers I'm going to be overcomers we
[1:38:44] have to learn to yield to him Church
[1:38:45] I've got to learn to yield a more that's
[1:38:51] one thing I learned you know when
[1:38:53] remember when brother Brian Hawkins got
[1:38:54] healed this summer let me just share
[1:38:57] this real quick
[1:38:57] all right look back as I was preparing
[1:38:59] this it came to me that was just a time
[1:39:01] that I yielded to God let me just give
[1:39:04] you a little background on that just a
[1:39:06] few hours before that we were having the
[1:39:08] youth banquet and it was all laughs it
[1:39:11] was all jokes
[1:39:12] it was just playing the kit that the
[1:39:13] youth were just having a fun time
[1:39:14] where's Lydia right let
[1:39:16] they were playing like a clue game and
[1:39:18] all the adults were dressed up remember
[1:39:21] in the picture that I showed you brother
[1:39:22] Brian head on like his military stuff
[1:39:24] that's cuz he was dressed up for a game
[1:39:26] we were playing a game I wasn't playing
[1:39:29] a game but I was just we were there to
[1:39:31] let the young people have a game and
[1:39:32] then everybody was filled up I had some
[1:39:35] dessert my brother any men it was
[1:39:36] goodness there it was like a chocolate
[1:39:37] cake or something in other words I'm
[1:39:39] saying like this I wasn't feeling very
[1:39:41] spiritual in fact I was kind of feeling
[1:39:44] like a little bit worldly myself but
[1:39:47] there was a service right after that and
[1:39:49] everybody's tired and brother Frank
[1:39:50] nobody shout in the service that I heard
[1:39:52] I would have to pray for the people and
[1:39:54] it just felt like the spiritual it was
[1:39:56] like this it was like mm-hmm
[1:39:58] you all know what I'm talking about have
[1:40:02] you been there sometimes special
[1:40:03] meetings it don't sound very spiritual
[1:40:05] but church after the service you know
[1:40:08] the brother preacher was a nice message
[1:40:09] nobody came up for prayer you know
[1:40:10] there's no young people I came up for
[1:40:12] prayer we're just down in the basement
[1:40:13] talking and I was just telling mother
[1:40:15] Brian you know I wonder how much you
[1:40:16] come preach for me sometime and he said
[1:40:19] you know brother Jesse I have been able
[1:40:20] to preach because he's turned me down a
[1:40:21] couple of times I said I said well
[1:40:23] brother are you still feel led to
[1:40:25] preaching so I've been battling this
[1:40:26] degeneration I've been battling the
[1:40:29] Crohn's disease and everything like that
[1:40:30] he said the doctor told me I got to get
[1:40:33] to hip replacements and I said I said
[1:40:37] okay and in my heart in my mind I'm like
[1:40:39] why is this have to happen he's 42 years
[1:40:41] old why does he have to suffer and get
[1:40:44] both hips replaced and church here's
[1:40:48] where here's where I could have just I
[1:40:51] could have just you know tried to get my
[1:40:53] arm in there I'm just gonna but I had to
[1:40:55] yield to the Holy Spirit and it and it
[1:40:58] just felt like the anointing of God came
[1:41:01] down and I just looked at brother Brian
[1:41:02] and brother Jim and I said brothers
[1:41:04] let's pray right now and ask God to give
[1:41:06] this man healing there's no way he
[1:41:09] should have to go under the knife and
[1:41:11] get both of his hips cut out and removed
[1:41:13] and be on crutches he's 42 years old and
[1:41:17] I can say one time in my life believe
[1:41:19] him and that was one time where I
[1:41:20] yielded to the Holy Spirit of course
[1:41:22] there's other times but I didn't feel
[1:41:25] spiritual I was full with sugar and you
[1:41:28] know bacon
[1:41:29] and we're just playing gating the man
[1:41:30] was dressed up playing the game but the
[1:41:33] Holy Spirit said this is the moment to
[1:41:35] yield and the Holy Spirit dropped down
[1:41:38] and I said is there any sin you need to
[1:41:41] confess before we pray he said no
[1:41:43] brother I searched my life and I believe
[1:41:45] God can do it so we pray and I said I
[1:41:47] speak life where the degeneration is the
[1:41:50] doctor said degeneration never gets
[1:41:52] fixed but we cursed that death and we
[1:41:54] spoke life and three days later you know
[1:41:56] the story he calls up and he says I'm
[1:41:58] shouting I'm praising God I'm trying not
[1:42:00] to shout too loud he said but the doctor
[1:42:02] has announced me somehow your body's
[1:42:04] healed itself
[1:42:05] how did it happen Church we just yield
[1:42:07] it to the Lord not my will not their
[1:42:10] will but God's will be done
[1:42:13] and that's why I want to share that I
[1:42:16] know it's a testimony we've heard before
[1:42:17] but I want to share it was a yielding to
[1:42:20] the Holy Spirit I didn't feel spiritual
[1:42:23] I didn't even fast that day sister
[1:42:25] Beatrice I didn't even fast I didn't
[1:42:27] fast and how many times I'm fast like
[1:42:30] every Sunday and every Wednesday forever
[1:42:32] for this church and I didn't even fast
[1:42:34] that day I probably over ain't brother
[1:42:36] William I probably over eight I'll be
[1:42:37] honest we out do it sometimes but see it
[1:42:43] wasn't me trying to make something
[1:42:44] happen
[1:42:45] I just yield it and let the father guide
[1:42:47] my hand glory amen

[1:43:17] and alive than is knowledge of and
[1:43:20] adherence to the pure Word of God amen
[1:43:25] in other words you're never gonna be as
[1:43:28] strong as you can be or as healthy as
[1:43:30] you can be unless you're obeying the
[1:43:32] word

[1:43:52] believe it's gonna be some of us
[1:43:53] hopefully all of us but the difference

[1:55:37] I thought about a little more just the
[1:56:12] thought struck me I tried to force my
[1:56:14] mom to believe it I was trying to push
[1:56:17] my arm to the hole in a work a few
[1:56:20] months after that brother bang I was
[1:56:21] real calm I got the shirt with Jim Myers
[1:56:23] I just shared ahead and argue with him I
[1:56:27] just shared it and it was like a fire
[1:56:29] struck so that's an example of trying to
[1:56:32] push it down somebody's throat but then
[1:56:33] another example just you'd into the Holy
[1:56:35] Spirit that God direct your words let
[1:56:38] God direct your path and all that the
[1:56:40] father gives me will come to me -
[1:56:42] texting Esther you know and a lot of
[1:56:53] children target them
[1:56:54] that disclosed or a prayer ever thankful
[1:56:57] for an overcoming life praise now where
[1:57:00] we just have to yield to the Holy Spirit
[1:57:02] greater that's the whole that's because
[1:57:04] in Scripture the greater is He that's in
[1:57:08] [Music]
