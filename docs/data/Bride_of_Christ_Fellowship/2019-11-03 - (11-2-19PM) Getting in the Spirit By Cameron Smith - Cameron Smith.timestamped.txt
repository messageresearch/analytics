[0:00] but it is very important it says and he
[0:03] went up went and sent to Jehoshaphat the
[0:06] king of Judah saying the king of Moab
[0:10] hath rebelled against me wilt thou go
[0:15] with me against Moab to battle and he
[0:20] said I will go up I am as thou art my
[0:24] people as thy people and my horses as
[0:27] thy horses and he said which way shall
[0:31] we go up and he answered the way through
[0:34] the wilderness of Edom so the king of
[0:40] Israel went and the king of Judah and
[0:43] the king of Edom and they fetched a
[0:46] compass of seven days journey and there
[0:50] was no water for the host for the cattle
[0:54] that followed them
[0:56] so notice seven days and what they were
[1:00] just getting weaker all the time because
[1:02] there was no water all right seven days
[1:05] and the king of Israel said alas that
[1:08] the LORD hath called these three kings
[1:10] together to deliver them into the hand
[1:14] of Moab but Jehoshaphat said is there
[1:21] not here a prophet of the Lord that we
[1:25] may inquire of the Lord by him and one
[1:29] of the king of Israel servants answered
[1:32] and said here is elisha the son of
[1:36] shaphat which poured water on the hands
[1:39] of Elijah one more passage revelations
[1:42] 1:10
[1:56] all right revelations 110 it says here I
[2:02] was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and
[2:07] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[2:13] trumpet this bow our heads forward
[2:16] prayer a precious Lord Jesus how he once
[2:22] again come as humbly as we can before
[2:24] you Lord and thou knowest O God that
[2:28] hearing the songs that are being sung I
[2:30] felt that this would be the way to go
[2:33] Lord because if there really is that
[2:35] type of a cry from the people of God
[2:37] there's a word to match that Lord we're
[2:40] asking tonight
[2:41] that Lord as we allow you to go forth
[2:45] that you would just give us all strength
[2:47] O God may we press into the word tonight
[2:49] and Lord may we Oh God and hear a
[2:52] revelation or here's something tonight
[2:54] that will stimulate our walk further O
[2:56] God that we might Oh God see a great
[3:00] movement of your life in us O God that
[3:02] we might be able to be used to bring
[3:05] revival to other souls Oh God
[3:08] we have to have virtue before we can
[3:10] give virtue of God and Lord your prophet
[3:14] liken that to the woman with the blood
[3:16] issue touching Jesus he said had that
[3:19] virtue so Lord with that being spoke
[3:22] we're just asking that you just be in
[3:23] our midst surely O God come speak to us
[3:26] in order to be yield to you now knowing
[3:29] that if we're not in the Spirit of God
[3:31] what good is any of it anyway so we just
[3:33] pray O God even now in the name of Jesus
[3:35] Christ that you'd have your way as we
[3:37] say Amen may be seated amen
[3:44] we're gonna minister tonight like I said
[3:47] just an inspirational message getting in
[3:50] the spirit here and we know our prophet
[3:52] worked with this extensively but I'll be
[3:55] honest with you I keep coming back to
[3:56] this myself and and I really believe
[3:59] that this is one of the key figures that
[4:01] will help us out amen
[4:03] but I want to
[4:04] start by going into this because as we
[4:07] seen in Revelations 110 there John was
[4:11] and the scripture says that he was in
[4:13] the spirit on the Lord's Day all right
[4:17] and notice in order for him to be part
[4:22] of that day and to be part of that
[4:25] revelation he had to be in the spirit
[4:28] amen
[4:29] remember if God could have gave you any
[4:31] better weapon he couldn't have done it
[4:35] because he already gave his best weapon
[4:38] and that was the Holy Ghost amen
[4:40] hallelujah the Holy Ghost the word
[4:42] himself coming and welling in you right
[4:44] in the scripture he said I will not
[4:46] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[4:48] not oh my it was so important to Jesus
[4:51] Christ that he said it's expedient that
[4:53] I go unto the Father because then the
[4:56] promise of the father could come upon
[4:58] you in it brother sister we're at a
[5:01] place right now where we really need a
[5:03] move of God in them we need the Holy
[5:05] Ghost to live in our lives like never
[5:07] before in them we need to what be so
[5:10] delivered from our own force that only
[5:14] the thought of God abides with us in in
[5:16] now notice here what is to be in the
[5:20] spirit known as Galatians 5:24 Galatians
[5:26] 5:24
[5:36] says here Galatians 5:24 it says and
[5:39] they that are Christ's have crucified
[5:43] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[5:49] so if you have truly been crucified with
[5:54] Christ then the flesh and the affections
[5:59] and lusts have all been crucified Amen
[6:03] hallelujah so the things that you used
[6:06] to lust for they're no longer a lust to
[6:09] you right the affections that you used
[6:12] to have for the carnal things and
[6:14] temporal things they've moved on in and
[6:16] why because you have taken up your cross
[6:19] and now you're following Christ amen
[6:23] so in the 25th verse it goes on to say
[6:26] if we live in the spirit let us also
[6:31] walk in the spirit all right
[6:35] so if you are going to live in the
[6:39] spirit all right so notice you're alive
[6:41] right now in it and the scripture calls
[6:45] us that if we're truly living in the
[6:48] spirit then one we're living in him
[6:50] right and yet the scripture does not
[6:53] tell us so notice it adds to it if we
[6:56] live in the spirit let us also walk in
[6:59] the spirit amen
[7:00] so every movement that we bring forth on
[7:04] this earth should be in the spirit amen
[7:08] that means the Holy Ghost guides you
[7:10] directs you and then lives inside of you
[7:13] hallelujah amen now let's get to the
[7:18] powerhouse quote here Patmos vision
[7:20] church age book part chapter 2 here 40
[7:23] 3-6 I want you to see what your prophet
[7:26] says because this will tell you a lot
[7:27] about yourself and where we need to be
[7:30] he says I was in the spirit isn't that
[7:35] just beautiful mind I love that you
[7:38] could just call those words the whole of
[7:42] the Christian life
[7:45] oh man it's good time for a little
[7:49] refreshing in the house of God and then
[7:51] so what is the whole of the Christian
[7:55] experience is it how much you can
[7:57] memorize is it how much you can quote
[7:59] the Prophet no but what is the whole of
[8:04] the Christian life is how much you can
[8:08] be in the spirit amen
[8:11] right now we're in the process because
[8:15] brother sister you'll see this but we
[8:17] could go this whole direction but your
[8:18] prophet said before you have a revival
[8:20] you got to get in the spirit of revival
[8:23] amen
[8:24] and if you are the spirit of revival
[8:26] you'll pray it up like you're in a
[8:28] revival even you long for God in your
[8:31] life amen
[8:32] and notice this because the thing about
[8:35] a revival that they always talk about is
[8:37] when you're in a revival you never feel
[8:40] like you have enough God but it says in
[8:48] the histories and everything as you look
[8:50] at them they said all these people
[8:52] didn't they didn't even think they had
[8:53] God they just were so hungry for God to
[8:57] be in their lives when they got in the
[8:59] spirit of revival they thought they
[9:01] didn't have any remember church age book
[9:03] talked about that right so notice the
[9:05] whole of the Christian life is in the
[9:09] spirit if we are going to live as
[9:12] Christians we have to be in his spirit
[9:19] John was not talking about being in his
[9:22] own spirit that would have not brought
[9:24] these visions it had to be the Spirit of
[9:27] God it has to be the Spirit of God with
[9:31] us - or all our efforts are in vain amen
[9:37] Paul said I will pray in the spirit and
[9:39] i will sing in the spirit i will live in
[9:43] the spirit oh my if there is anything
[9:45] good that will come to me it has to be
[9:49] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[9:52] word and made manifest by the results it
[9:55] brings amen
[9:58] as surely as John needed to be in the
[10:01] spirit to be confirmed by the word so if
[10:05] you are going to be confirmed by the
[10:07] word you have to be in the spirit it
[10:13] just can't be in a place and this is
[10:15] what what troubles Laodicea so much is
[10:18] because we're in such an age now where
[10:20] people don't know if they have the Holy
[10:22] Ghost
[10:23] one day they think they'll have it the
[10:25] next day they don't think they have it
[10:26] and they'll go back and forth right but
[10:31] your prophet said he said you have to
[10:34] have patience with God he said but God
[10:38] has to have patience in you because he
[10:41] gave you the word and you have your ups
[10:44] and your downs when we should be at a
[10:48] perfect consistency bleeding this word
[10:52] that's why this message was sent that's
[10:56] why this revelation come amen the
[10:59] opening of the seals the revealing of
[11:02] this word it brought us to a place that
[11:05] we can recognize the enemy in every
[11:07] attack amen and what we can discern the
[11:11] two spirits and we can withstand the
[11:13] enemy any minute drive them away
[11:16] hey amen so notice she says as surely as
[11:21] John needed to be in the spirit to be
[11:23] confirmed by the word and made manifest
[11:26] by the results of theirs as surely as
[11:28] Johnny and being the spirits received
[11:30] these tremendous revelations from Jesus
[11:32] we need to be in the spirit to
[11:34] understand the revelations that God has
[11:38] given to us to live by in his word for
[11:43] it is the same spirit amen so notice in
[11:48] order for us to even have revelation we
[11:51] have to be in the spirit
[11:54] uh-oh mine so Galatians 5:16 I want you
[12:04] to see this because this is important I
[12:06] could I could definitely write a tangent
[12:07] for the rest of service on this
[12:09] Galatians 5:16 it says here this I say
[12:16] then walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[12:24] fulfill the lusts of the flesh
[12:26] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[12:30] and the spirit against the flesh and
[12:33] these are contrary the one to the other
[12:36] so that ye cannot do the things that you
[12:40] would but if he be led of the Spirit ye
[12:43] are not under the law in them so notice
[12:47] if you're in the spirit you're not even
[12:51] on the law anymore but why is that
[12:53] because the law himself is inside of you
[12:58] you viewed it to the source of
[13:01] righteousness amen you come in line with
[13:04] a God who can keep you line up amen you
[13:09] see who's gonna get you to serve him the
[13:12] best God Himself amen hallelujah that's
[13:15] why he sent the Holy Ghost amen because
[13:18] if you don't have the Holy Ghost you are
[13:20] going through a legalistic hole and it
[13:23] will make you miserable amen that's why
[13:27] most Christians they get so miserable
[13:29] especially within this message because
[13:31] they gotta wear a skirt or they got to
[13:34] do this and they got to do that you
[13:36] don't have to do anything you just got
[13:39] to get the Holy Ghost amen because the
[13:43] Holy Ghost you get he'll make you
[13:45] satisfied with the work you receive that
[13:49] word and that word brings your
[13:52] satisfaction
[13:54] ohuh so Romans 8:5 says
[14:04] Romans 8:5 it says here for they that
[14:10] are after the flesh do mind the things
[14:14] of the flesh but they that are after the
[14:18] spirit the things of the Spirit ah you
[14:24] just think about the things of the Lord
[14:27] for to be carnally minded is death but
[14:33] to be spiritually minded is life and
[14:35] peace so if you are living in the spirit
[14:41] what type of a mind should be in you
[14:45] confusion frustration when you're truly
[14:51] living in the spirit
[14:54] the Bible says you'll have life and
[14:57] peace so the people you just seen at the
[15:04] restaurant wherever you are
[15:05] they don't have life because they don't
[15:08] have this word and your thought is what
[15:12] they need I they need these but if you
[15:16] don't if you're not living in the spirit
[15:19] then you don't have anything to offer
[15:21] them you look the same way they do right
[15:26] we're trying to sell a gospel that's
[15:29] supposed to make us the happiest people
[15:31] in the world does that make sense
[15:35] people will crave the God that satisfies
[15:38] you and if you don't have a God that
[15:41] satisfies you they'll see that but if
[15:46] you do have a God that satisfies you
[15:48] they'll see your life and your peace and
[15:50] they'll follow it amen all right
[15:54] notice again Patmos vision 44 2x1 Church
[15:57] age book it says look at it this way all
[16:00] too many read the Bible where it says in
[16:02] acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every
[16:06] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[16:08] for the remission of your sins and ye
[16:10] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[16:12] and they just
[16:15] right on they don't see it they don't
[16:19] see the baptism
[16:20] I just preach it at the last few
[16:23] funerals I did they don't see it if they
[16:29] saw it by getting in the spirit they
[16:35] would know that if they want to receive
[16:39] the Holy Spirit they need to repent and
[16:43] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[16:45] Jesus Christ and then God would be
[16:49] duty-bound to fulfill his word by
[16:52] filling them with the Holy Ghost they
[16:55] never get in his spirit or it would
[16:58] happen to them exactly as the word says
[17:04] so if you follow acts 2:38 there's no
[17:08] reason for you not to have Holy Ghost
[17:10] there's no reason for you not to have
[17:12] life in peace it's the reason why God
[17:15] should not give you with a supernatural
[17:18] from ABAB amen so notice he says pray to
[17:24] God for a revelation by his Spirit this
[17:29] is the first step get in the spirit the
[17:36] whole of your experience is going to be
[17:39] how successful you'll ever be is how
[17:43] much you can live in the spirit you've
[17:47] got to get in the spirit you know that
[17:52] word get getting in the spirit that
[17:56] sounds like a push doesn't it
[17:57] you got a press to get in the spirit
[18:01] amen amen
[18:04] those Patmos vision again I'm arena I
[18:07] read a lot of quotes here about hope
[18:08] that's all right
[18:09] Patmos vision he says all right now he
[18:10] was in the spirit the Lord's Day now
[18:12] remember the first thing you have to do
[18:14] is what get in the spirit how these
[18:17] revelations going to ever come to you
[18:20] get in the spirit how are you ever going
[18:22] to get the Holy Ghost get in the spirit
[18:24] get in the spirit
[18:26] you got to get in the spirit to get to
[18:29] all the
[18:34] when you was a sinner and you went to a
[18:38] dance you got in that spirit now look at
[18:43] how he ties us in and this is where this
[18:45] is where you know we get our little
[18:47] scarecrows of Pentecostalism and so
[18:49] forth he says oh my you started clapping
[18:54] your hands and patting your feet and
[18:56] chin digging it and throwing your hat on
[19:00] the floor and going around and around
[19:03] acting silly you was in the spirit of it
[19:08] could you imagine a fellow was a dance
[19:11] theme going to a dance and say well and
[19:15] you all have a pretty good time I
[19:17] suppose when someone loves something if
[19:24] they love to dance they're gonna dance
[19:28] right most of us come out of oil I know
[19:32] I wasn't the only one on the dance floor
[19:37] but why does that leave our experience
[19:41] when we come to the word go there again
[19:44] hallelujah I'll get quiet if you want
[19:47] that's alright because you should do it
[19:50] in the spirit see but if you're
[19:55] interested about bringing forth the
[19:58] Spirit of God in your life you have to
[20:00] art you have to learn how to get in the
[20:02] spirit so notice how he brings this
[20:06] forth because he begins to tie getting
[20:08] in the spirit with someone who wants to
[20:11] dance you gotta want to receive the Holy
[20:15] Ghost you got to want to participate in
[20:20] that dancer so you see what it is that
[20:23] individual that goes to the worldly
[20:25] dance if they were just going to go to
[20:28] that dance where it's a dance and they
[20:32] go to that dance and they just go and
[20:34] sit on the sidelines they really didn't
[20:38] go
[20:40] to get in the spirit of that but if they
[20:46] go and they were one the first time that
[20:50] they hear the music come forth and they
[20:53] get out there they know their purpose
[20:57] why they're there and they know what
[21:00] pleases them and what they're looking
[21:04] for a satisfaction to come by amen and
[21:08] that's the way it is with us amen
[21:11] it's not a trial to come to the house of
[21:14] God the Bible states if you have the
[21:17] true revelation they do we need to get
[21:19] in the spirit of this revelation but
[21:21] better is one day in your courts than a
[21:24] thousand elsewhere you have to be in the
[21:28] spirit of that word amen you have to
[21:32] believe that amen but don't you know
[21:35] you'll show if you do believe that
[21:37] because when you go to church you're not
[21:40] just there I had a person say one time
[21:42] he said I'm just a few warmer I said
[21:45] well that's not what I would want to be
[21:49] but that's what he considered himself
[21:51] just a Pew warmer I want to be a Pew
[21:54] warmer I don't come to the house of God
[21:57] - did you sit there and just sit in a
[22:00] stagnant experience right when we come
[22:04] to the house of God what are we trying
[22:06] to manifest here a revelation of the
[22:13] word true worship to the spirit all the
[22:18] promises of God divine healing the nine
[22:23] gifts of the Spirit everything the Bible
[22:27] says that yours it's yours
[22:34] Christ died for that day men he died to
[22:39] give you those gifts amen so how could
[22:42] we just let him sit well we have to get
[22:44] in the spirit what if I said this what
[22:49] you know how many how many come to
[22:52] church tonight and said you know what
[22:53] all things are possible tonight God I
[22:58] want to be available for whatever you
[22:59] want God I want to be available if you
[23:03] want to prophesy through me I want to be
[23:06] available if you want me to pray for
[23:08] someone and they to deal I want to be
[23:12] available but what are you doing you're
[23:15] getting in the spirit of the service
[23:18] you're bringing the expectation of what
[23:22] this really is all about all right
[23:25] wonderful
[23:27] so the first step when you come to
[23:30] church when you're looking for something
[23:32] from God you got to get in the spirit
[23:36] again he says in Patmos vision he says
[23:40] no no we're skip that so I want to take
[23:44] this turn if we can I'm going to take
[23:47] this turn because this is where it
[23:49] becomes such an interesting thing
[23:51] because we say well what do we do do we
[23:54] have to provoke her or get a emotion on
[23:57] the scene what do we have to do to get
[23:59] in the spirit
[24:00] your prophet made it sound like that
[24:05] they do shindig in there why not some
[24:09] shindig and over there and that's where
[24:12] Pentecostals went off right but I want
[24:16] you to see this here seven church Ages
[24:19] 54 says no matter how saintly you are
[24:22] how godly you are how much of a minister
[24:25] or lay member or whatever you are you'll
[24:27] never be able to get anywhere with God
[24:30] till you get in the spirit that's right
[24:34] I don't mean get in emotion now look at
[24:39] this I mean get in the spirit see
[24:44] me you get in a motion you do anything
[24:47] but when you get in the spirit you see
[24:51] things so it's so easy to sit and say
[25:00] well looks like we don't need any
[25:02] emotion here take that smile off your
[25:04] face brother it's a little bit too much
[25:07] for the house of God tonight we already
[25:11] had one services they hey come on now
[25:12] how are you doing that so though people
[25:18] actually read that and they'll say you
[25:19] see getting in the spirit has nothing to
[25:22] do with emotion let's keep reading let's
[25:26] keep checking that Moe's vision again he
[25:29] says let's use another illustration
[25:31] suppose you need healing what does the
[25:34] word say well we have all read it
[25:37] countless times but did not get in the
[25:40] spirit when reading it so notice when
[25:47] you read the Bible you have to get in
[25:50] the spirit of that word you read the
[25:54] vine healing it says I am the lord that
[25:56] heals all our diseases it's not just a
[25:58] scripture but that's the promise of God
[26:01] that's anointed by the Holy Ghost and
[26:04] because his word chose you you can
[26:07] believe that and he'll bring it forth in
[26:09] your life he then knows what he says so
[26:13] what does the word say well we have all
[26:16] read it countless times but then we get
[26:17] in disparity reading did we ask God for
[26:19] His Spirit to teach us the real truth of
[26:22] it if we did we would call the elders
[26:25] confess our sins he anointed and prayed
[26:28] for and that would be that it might not
[26:30] come immediately but in his spirit it's
[26:33] all over there is no other Court of
[26:38] Appeal God will fulfill his word oh we
[26:46] need to get in the spirit and then
[26:49] things will be done look what he says
[26:52] don't go through the acts first
[26:56] this is it right here get in the spirit
[27:01] and then go through the acts and watch
[27:05] what God will do so now you see what
[27:12] your prophets say is it emotion is
[27:16] emotion wrong emotion is wrong when it's
[27:19] the first thing you don't do the acts
[27:25] first you get in the spirit first you
[27:29] get in the spirit of the promised earth
[27:32] and then you just let God be God amen
[27:38] amen
[27:41] so we go to Psalms 4 verse 4
[27:58] Psalms 44 it says stand in all and sin
[28:03] not commune with your own heart upon
[28:05] your bed and be still Salah offer the
[28:08] sacrifices of righteousness and put your
[28:11] trust in the Lord there be many that say
[28:16] who will shew us any good Lord lift up
[28:20] the light of thy countenance upon us
[28:23] thou has put gladness in my heart more
[28:28] than in the time that their corn in
[28:31] their wine increased I will both lay me
[28:34] down in peace and sleep for thou Lord
[28:37] only make us me to dwell in safety amen
[28:42] there be many that say that what who
[28:45] will shew us any good they men but David
[28:50] he could say that what God will bring it
[28:53] to us amen
[28:55] and what by experience he could say God
[28:59] you brought gladness to my heart notice
[29:05] how much of a gladness was it says more
[29:07] than in the time that the corn and the
[29:11] wine increased so more than the very
[29:15] substance that they lived off of was the
[29:19] moving of the Spirit in his life to
[29:22] bring satisfaction to his soul oh my oh
[29:28] you getting in the spirit is it more
[29:32] than your daily bread oh my and what as
[29:37] we line our expectation up with it it
[29:40] begins to perform because that's what he
[29:43] said
[29:44] he said if you get in the spirit then
[29:45] things get done so wait let me ask you a
[29:49] question so if it seems like nothing's
[29:52] ever going on in the church what's going
[29:56] on are we getting in the spirit
[30:06] remember what your prophet said he said
[30:09] in 64 question-and-answers he said if
[30:12] you were in unity
[30:13] he said the signs and wonders would be
[30:16] multiplying among you all the time right
[30:23] now oh my do you realize that your
[30:28] prophet said he said every revival
[30:31] started with divine healing so you know
[30:36] what a sign is that God's trying to send
[30:39] a revival when everybody's sick and
[30:47] there's sick people all around you what
[30:50] God is trying to show you is that he is
[30:53] trying to bring revival amen he places a
[30:59] condition of sickness in your minutes
[31:01] because he wants you to be alive in the
[31:05] Spirit of God so that the enemy of
[31:08] sickness can be destroyed amen
[31:13] well you promise it every single revival
[31:16] start the same way divine healing it had
[31:19] to God had to get the people looking to
[31:23] a place that they needed help and they
[31:27] had to what they had to see their need
[31:29] and say god I guess I better die to
[31:31] myself there's got to be more to this
[31:35] all right Patmos vision sixty he says
[31:42] maybe he was dancing jumping running all
[31:45] around the ion talking about John he was
[31:48] having a good time he was in the spirit
[31:51] so you see what your prophet said said
[31:54] maybe he was dancing and jumping and
[31:55] running all around the island because he
[31:59] was in the spirit he said that mites may
[32:03] sound sacrilegious but I don't mean it
[32:05] that way
[32:06] see he thought that's he's been he might
[32:10] might have been doing that I believe he
[32:12] was having a good time in the spirit
[32:14] just pray
[32:16] using God because that's exactly what
[32:19] happened when the spirit fell on them in
[32:21] the first place when the Holy Ghost fell
[32:27] on them they staggered like drunk men
[32:29] and women and acted like they were drunk
[32:32] and jabbering and carrying on like that
[32:35] till the people said these people are
[32:37] fooled new one that's the way they acted
[32:40] the first time so the spirit come on
[32:42] again he probably acted the same way
[32:48] there's nothing new about this thing
[32:52] this is an old-time religion so you see
[32:58] what you need to expect you need to
[33:01] expect staggering around drunk in the
[33:04] spirit you need to expect the wind of
[33:12] the Holy Ghost blowing through we had to
[33:16] happen I was praying for someone up
[33:18] front about three months ago at our
[33:21] church and I was praying for him and I
[33:22] felt this wind blow on me and I was in
[33:25] the building so I looked over looked
[33:27] over like because I figured maybe
[33:28] somebody's walking by me there's nobody
[33:30] there but our sister got a victory I
[33:35] [Music]
[33:37] don't know I asked the sister I said did
[33:40] you feel that she said I thought that Oh
[33:42] hallelujah but we have to expect the
[33:49] word to be made manifest in our midst
[33:52] not a different word but the old-time
[33:55] Holy Spirit amen you see you're being
[33:59] returned to the mystery of 33 82 53 ad
[34:05] you're coming back to that mystery when
[34:10] the Holy Ghost fell on them and your
[34:12] prophet said they packed the orders of
[34:14] God out he said in the same quote he
[34:18] said they had those seven virtues on
[34:20] them do you realize that the statue of a
[34:24] perfect man when God poured the Holy
[34:27] Ghost on them that 20
[34:28] years they were given the holy ghost
[34:31] with the statue of a perfect man on them
[34:37] this is my other message I was going to
[34:39] get to how to say it for what it is now
[34:42] so what is it now remember that 20 years
[34:49] and then they entered into the Ephesians
[34:52] church age and what happened relent
[34:54] relaxed and aimed at and what the church
[34:57] beginning to go and die out and die out
[34:59] and die out but every one of those ages
[35:03] God was actually doing a lot he was
[35:06] manifesting those virtues in each one of
[35:12] those ages now think about this because
[35:17] that's what we've come to now your
[35:21] prophet said in the church age he said
[35:23] they didn't have to live those out like
[35:26] we do now
[35:28] why was that because the Prophet
[35:32] preached the pyramid message this is
[35:36] your learner's going to preach is what
[35:38] the Prophet preached the pyramid message
[35:40] remember junior Jackson he's seen the
[35:45] Prophet take a crowbar and break off the
[35:48] top of that pyramid and what they see
[35:51] they seen the revelation inside and what
[35:55] is it then your prophet talks about it
[35:59] in stature and perfect man he said now
[36:01] and you said you have to have these and
[36:03] once you have them then you're a living
[36:05] moving Idol so why are we seeing what it
[36:11] is now see Pentecost 1906 it didn't
[36:17] bring it didn't bring the character it
[36:22] brought the manifestation of the Spirit
[36:25] which it was peaking then and then God
[36:28] used that to bring in the Elijah
[36:32] messenger but the Elijah messenger would
[36:37] manifest the water but his purpose was
[36:40] what
[36:42] his purpose was not just a do for divine
[36:44] healing and miracles his purpose was to
[36:47] break the mystery of this hour so what'd
[36:54] it do it showed that that it showed that
[36:56] the church ages and what everything did
[36:58] but notice what it did he said that's my
[37:02] pyramid message so it came right back
[37:06] down to it where in order to manifest
[37:12] this adoption that were called unto it's
[37:16] going to take faith virtue knowledge
[37:19] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[37:24] kindness in order to manifest the
[37:31] fullness of Jesus Christ God is calling
[37:34] you to manifest the character of Christ
[37:40] because what what is that remember what
[37:45] was the purpose of that pyramid without
[37:47] the capstone it was to express the seven
[37:54] virtues within it but the capstone was
[37:58] the top that would settle down on the
[38:01] whole thing and your prophet said his
[38:03] flange so it would sit right on it and
[38:05] it repelled the wine but your prophet
[38:10] talked about that because in order to
[38:13] receive I hear he him in this hour you
[38:16] have to reflect those seven virtues and
[38:20] then what does that bring forth that
[38:24] brings forth all the Spirit of Christ in
[38:28] you Oh hallelujah glory to God see again
[38:42] Patmos vision he said see a roads built
[38:45] away a good road is built the highest
[38:48] parts in the center because it lets all
[38:51] the trash wash off both sides that's it
[38:54] when a man
[38:56] he comes to Christ he's got his eyes
[38:58] centered on Christ if he's a little bit
[39:02] emotional he'll be a fanatic if he's a
[39:08] little bit cold he'll get on this other
[39:11] side and be just a cucumber over on that
[39:17] side see his intellectual so we don't
[39:23] want to be a fanatic or cucumber but
[39:29] notice but the main thing is right in
[39:33] the middle of the road with enough
[39:38] spirit in you to keep you warm and
[39:41] moving amen and knowing enough to keep
[39:45] yourself under obedience to the spirit
[39:48] and move just as the spirit moves not to
[39:52] or not after just as the spirit moves so
[39:58] what do we call to do we're called to
[40:01] walk what never cold
[40:04] that's fanatical but we're called to
[40:07] walk right in the middle we're warmed up
[40:11] by the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[40:13] right you can love right you can live
[40:15] right you can show people that
[40:18] something's changed amen glory to God
[40:22] amen second Kings 312 second Kings 312
[40:51] second Kings 3:12 it says here and
[40:55] Jehoshaphat said the word of the Lord is
[40:58] with him so the king of Israel and
[41:02] Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went
[41:05] down to him and Elisha said under the
[41:08] king of Israel what am I to do with thee
[41:11] get me to the prophets of thy father and
[41:14] to the prophets of thy mother and the
[41:17] king of Israel said unto him nay for the
[41:20] Lord hath called these strings three
[41:22] Kings together to deliver them into the
[41:24] hand of Moab and Elisha said as the Lord
[41:28] of Hosts liveth before whom I stand
[41:31] surely were not that I regard the
[41:33] presence of Jehoshaphat the king of
[41:35] Judah I would not look toward thee nor
[41:37] season but now bring me a minstrel and
[41:40] it came to pass when the minstrel play
[41:45] that the hand of the Lord came upon him
[41:49] and he said thus saith the Lord make
[41:53] this valley full of ditches so remember
[41:59] they went on a seven-day journey and on
[42:03] that seventh day it was so dry that they
[42:07] thought that God had delivered them into
[42:08] the hand of Moab into the hands of the
[42:12] enemy oh my it says in the 17 verse for
[42:18] thus saith the Lord you shall not see
[42:21] wind neither shall ye see rain yet the
[42:25] valley shall be filled with water that
[42:28] you may drink both ye and your cattle
[42:30] and your beasts and this is what a light
[42:33] thing in the sight of the Lord he will
[42:34] deliver the Moabites also into your hand
[42:38] it a team ahead hey man isn't that
[42:43] something God God by that prophet he
[42:46] wouldn't even talk to him if it wasn't
[42:49] for somebody godly standing in the mist
[42:53] oh ma I wonder if we got some godly
[42:56] people in the midst hearing that now
[43:00] look at all's it took Elijah knew coz
[43:06] notice he was obviously a little riled
[43:09] up here he needed to get in the spirit
[43:13] to prophesy so what do you do he said
[43:16] you got to bring him in stroll bring
[43:19] somebody who can play over here and then
[43:24] then we'll see the Spirit of God move
[43:27] so notice getting in the spirit he said
[43:30] II 35 this old prophet really got his
[43:33] righteous indignation stirred up and he
[43:37] bawled them out and he told them about
[43:41] all these alliances and organizations
[43:44] that they were having he said
[43:46] nevertheless he said bring me a minstrel
[43:48] oh he had to get his temper down a
[43:51] little you know he got all hit up and so
[43:56] he said bring me a minstrel he said now
[43:59] what about some of you Church of Christ
[44:02] people so-called that don't believe in
[44:05] music in the church after he got all
[44:09] head up he needed a little music to
[44:11] bring the spirit on that's right yes sir
[44:16] now remember God doesn't change and if
[44:19] the good music brought the spirit on the
[44:21] Prophet then it'll do the same thing
[44:24] today that's exactly right because God
[44:26] loves it sure he said bring me a
[44:30] minstrel well you say well yeah I ain't
[44:32] a prophet but maybe you can be part of
[44:35] the minstrel you know you can do
[44:39] something shorted that's all you got a
[44:43] testimony or something you can do you
[44:49] don't have to be the seventh angel you
[44:53] don't have to be you don't have to have
[44:54] the discernment of false intents of the
[44:56] heart
[44:57] Hebrews 4:12 you have a that rolled out
[45:00] but discernment is one of those nine
[45:02] gifts but what we have
[45:07] find our gifts in the body because how
[45:11] will they work if it's a gift of the
[45:14] Holy Ghost it'll have to work by the
[45:17] Holy Ghost being in the service
[45:22] so without look at how your prophet says
[45:26] this he says if you do get in the spirit
[45:28] you said you might just be a minstrel
[45:30] you might be the minstrel to bring it
[45:31] for he said you might just have the
[45:35] testimony that comes from he says he
[45:41] says or there's something you can do
[45:45] who's gonna line it up who's gonna set
[45:48] it in motion
[45:49] the Lord will but he must be welcome in
[45:54] this place and we have to realize that
[45:59] we're here to do something we're here to
[46:04] manifest Christ your whole goal as the
[46:10] body should be how can I make the Spirit
[46:14] of God more welcome here you know what
[46:18] phenomenal about the about the Azusa
[46:20] Street revival is they said that the
[46:23] vast majority of miracles that happen in
[46:25] Azusa Street were not done by the hands
[46:27] of William Seymour but they said that
[46:30] when the music began to play a bunch of
[46:34] young people would get in the spirit and
[46:36] they would just go and pray for people
[46:39] so while the worship was going on they
[46:42] would just go pray for people that
[46:44] people get healed bring me a minstrel
[46:50] [Laughter]
[46:53] hey man hey man he says again fabulous
[47:01] vision 40 4-3 he says have you ever
[47:03] noticed how the world gets into the
[47:05] spirit of things that are in the world
[47:06] they go to their ballgames their
[47:08] sporting events and their dances they
[47:11] enter into the spirit of it they don't
[47:13] sit there like wallflowers old dried-up
[47:15] sticks they enter right into the field
[47:17] of things and will and because
[47:19] a part of things but oh how they hate
[47:22] the Christians for getting in the Spirit
[47:24] of God they call us fanatics and holy
[47:28] rollers there is nothing they won't do
[47:31] to show their hatred and disapproval but
[47:33] ignore that you can expect it knowing
[47:37] where is coming from just go on and get
[47:41] in the spirit of worship hallelujah he
[47:51] says it again
[47:58] let's get to this right here we're gonna
[48:00] close getting in the spirit he says he
[48:04] says that's the way you get a revival
[48:07] it's when you really get in the spirit
[48:10] of revival not looping it up or
[48:13] something but by praying it down until
[48:20] there's a revival that strikes in your
[48:24] heart until all the laws of Ecclesiastes
[48:34] ISM all the logs of fanaticism all the
[48:37] logs of system all the logs of unbelief
[48:39] flow out then the waters of God comes
[48:43] falling down upon you there you are amen
[48:49] so now notice what it is if we want to
[48:54] revival here how are we going to do it
[48:57] we got to pray it down until God strikes
[49:01] something in our hearts to say God I
[49:04] need more of you amen I got to pray more
[49:07] and not just pray more but what when the
[49:12] temptations come by your phone to take
[49:14] your time by the computer computer or
[49:17] whatever it is you have a hold in your
[49:21] life that pulls you to Christ more than
[49:24] that
[49:25] [Music]
[49:27] you have to pray till you get that
[49:29] because these cell phones they are primo
[49:33] in our lives they've made it now so you
[49:37] can't live without it you got to fill
[49:41] job applications out with them you can
[49:44] buy stuff cheaper with them Google's got
[49:48] a lot of answers but they can't get you
[49:54] to the answer about how to manifest
[49:57] Christ amen yep he says again he says
[50:09] just keep praying keep digging
[50:12] yeah don't stop just like when Elijah
[50:14] told them dig ditches out there when you
[50:18] get down you hit an old tin can say I'm
[50:21] too tired
[50:22] throw it out of the way and keep digging
[50:27] remember the more ditches and the deeper
[50:30] they were the more water they were going
[50:32] to be filled with he said just keep
[50:38] digging cuz we've got to dig we've just
[50:41] got to dig that's all cuz if you expect
[50:44] to miss the Tribulation
[50:47] you better start digging you notice how
[50:57] he ties that in with getting in the
[51:00] spirit being in the spirit is what it is
[51:06] something you must have for a rapture
[51:09] because that's what caught John Oh
[51:11] what's going to catch you up in the
[51:13] clouds and notice what he said if you're
[51:16] going to miss this tribulation you
[51:17] better dig out all the junk out of your
[51:20] life start digging it out this is never
[51:24] more applicable than right now your
[51:28] pastor priority told you but he showed
[51:30] me earlier about how all the Christian
[51:32] churches under Trump they're all coming
[51:34] together
[51:34] never unified like this before
[51:38] you got 12,000 is probably more now
[51:41] because there's thousands of earthquakes
[51:42] in California tremors every week it's
[51:45] getting ready to go in the sodomite
[51:49] condition is the such a place now that
[51:52] they're forced and operating your
[51:54] children there's no recovery now it's
[52:00] over so the question is how much more
[52:05] long suffering will God be before
[52:07] California slides in the ocean and let's
[52:12] get things moving Oh hallelujah
[52:15] oh we're just as long sufferings God we
[52:17] don't want anybody to die we can go to
[52:18] hell we don't want anybody but we are
[52:21] what we are concerned about fulfilling
[52:24] God's Word remember that stuff can't
[52:28] happen until you come to position that's
[52:33] the thing about God's masterpiece it
[52:35] brings all these things to place at the
[52:38] same time just like in the crucifixion
[52:42] and the resurrection
[52:43] it brought prophecy after prophecy
[52:44] everything lined up right there it does
[52:48] the same thing now so what you gonna do
[52:51] better start digging so he talked about
[52:56] it again
[52:58] he says perfect strike by perfect
[53:01] weakness he says now if somebody can
[53:05] become one of his people God can use
[53:08] them if they're ready to forget that
[53:10] they are as somebody if you're ready to
[53:12] forget that you're somebody and become a
[53:14] nobody then God can use you and make you
[53:17] somebody out of you but you got to
[53:19] forget that you're so important are you
[53:26] important just forget about it there's
[53:35] many of us many of us do that in our
[53:38] lives as soon some people as soon as
[53:41] they become Christians they become
[53:43] arrogant indifferent when they they're
[53:47] just taking a vice-versa path they're
[53:50] going back
[53:51] instead of forward he said more of you
[53:55] you can get out of yourself the more
[53:58] room you've got for the Holy Spirit to
[54:00] come in like Elijah told Jehoshaphat
[54:04] them dig this place full of ditches
[54:06] deeper you did the more room you're
[54:09] going to have for water the more of our
[54:11] own selves their own rubbish of our own
[54:14] abilities that we can throw out of us
[54:17] the more room they'll be to be filled by
[54:20] the Spirit of God long as we can do that
[54:23] the more your prophet said in that
[54:25] message he said we have to master human
[54:28] ability if you don't master human
[54:33] ability then you won't see it
[54:36] well why because if you master human
[54:38] ability you master that you're nothing
[54:40] and then you get in the spirit
[54:43] see you forget about who you are we're
[54:47] closed right here
[54:53] why Phoenix 61 he says now you people
[54:56] that wanted to renew the joy of your
[54:58] salvation somewhere you've lost your joy
[55:04] think back to what you did did you
[55:11] neglect prayer meeting did you neglect
[55:24] reading the Bible did you neglect
[55:30] praying at your home asking the blessing
[55:34] at the table don't never do that Omaha
[55:38] that's all I'm becoming to Christians no
[55:41] matter where you are bow your head and
[55:45] pray don't be ashamed of him pray
[55:48] anywhere see and if ever where you left
[55:51] that joy that wherever whatever we did
[55:55] it out what little root of bitterness
[55:57] come in he said remember when a man is
[56:01] saying this much like this button here
[56:04] because it's her
[56:05] Oh life in your heart that's God as
[56:07] you're able to push out all the roots of
[56:10] bitterness then God begins to spread in
[56:14] you then you become a son of God and man
[56:18] was made to be a God you know he's in
[56:21] the image of God he's a son of God he's
[56:23] like him he was giving her domain
[56:25] dominion over the whole earth that's
[56:26] right he ruled the earth he ruled the
[56:29] animal kingdom and all the other
[56:30] kingdoms all but the kingdom of God
[56:32] above he was God he was an amateur God
[56:36] he was made the image of God made light
[56:39] God had hands and feet like God he was
[56:41] the image of God what happened because
[56:43] he disbelieved God's Word it sent him
[56:47] right back out to shift for himself now
[56:50] God's trying to bring him back and when
[56:54] you have faith and accept him my brother
[56:56] just let that little light begin to grow
[57:00] out and all of the roots of doubt and
[57:03] bitterness yielding yourself to the
[57:04] Spirit then you begin to become a son of
[57:08] God a daughter of God begin to grow in
[57:10] the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins
[57:12] to build his kingdom in within you
[57:16] he said now if you even if you've
[57:18] grieved the Holy Spirit somewhere then
[57:20] go right back and think in your mind
[57:22] what did I start doing neglecting church
[57:26] did I start fussing with another
[57:28] denomination that's something you can
[57:30] start busting with another message
[57:32] church you'll lose your joy that was
[57:36] brotherly kindness did I start picking
[57:42] on this one doing this to my neighbor if
[57:44] you did that's what snapped it out go
[57:47] say God I'm sorry I will go right back
[57:50] and make this thing right I will go
[57:52] right and do it then the joy will come
[57:54] back to your salvation together
[57:57] hallelujah remember your prophet talked
[58:04] about the Holy Spirit he said it's kind
[58:06] of like an automobile and said he said
[58:08] there's a lot that goes to a car he said
[58:11] there's
[58:14] he said their Springs and carburetors
[58:16] and all this stuff like that he said
[58:18] there's so much that goes with it and
[58:20] that's the way it is with the Holy Ghost
[58:22] but the first thing that your prophet
[58:26] said is praying for that revelation get
[58:29] in the spirit get in the spirit
[58:35] maybe if you've already had the Holy
[58:37] Ghost where did you lose it at your
[58:40] prophet said he just went up on a raft
[58:42] earlier could you imagine an entire
[58:50] church moving with this revelation
[58:56] walking forth in the Spirit of God not
[58:59] afraid to dance not afraid to scream and
[59:03] shout not afraid to worship God not
[59:07] afraid to say God there's gifts in my
[59:09] life
[59:10] bring them out Lord I believe I'm here
[59:13] for a purpose and then watch the Holy
[59:17] Ghost begin to pour more water in those
[59:20] ditches let's stand it's been a seven
[59:29] day journey and then ended up really dry
[59:33] but now the commandment is dig those
[59:37] ditches out you're going to miss the
[59:39] tribulation dig it out get in the Spirit
[59:42] of God in the spirit of revival get in
[59:45] the spirit of prayer if you don't have
[59:50] that joy in your life find out where you
[59:54] left it say God I want you fresh then
[59:59] let's say a word of Prayer our precious

[1:00:12] congregational God being receptive to

[1:00:18] amens were not in vain
[1:00:21] those amens mean that they believe and
[1:00:25] Nord because they believed it we believe
[1:00:28] Oh God that the whole of the Christian
[1:00:31] experience will manifest in this church
[1:00:34] it'll manifest in every life it'll bring
[1:00:38] forth a Holy Ghost move that will help
[1:00:43] them to become satisfied with their
[1:00:46] calling in you we're just praying now
[1:00:49] Lord that you dropped the spirit of
[1:00:52] revival in our midst
[1:00:54] well God may we pray Oh Oh God until it
[1:00:56] strikes in our heart little God let us
[1:00:59] find where we left you if we've left you
[1:01:05] Nord may we draw you back we know that
[1:01:09] if your prophet said that you're just
[1:01:10] that far away and you're willing to come
[1:01:12] back it's something so simple to get you
[1:01:15] back
[1:01:15] that's something hard nor do you see
[1:01:18] each need on every heart tonight see oh
[1:01:22] god maybe there's a move of restoration

[1:29:28] based on it's all time together finding
[1:29:32] our purpose where we're going to find
[1:29:33] our purpose in the sphere we're gonna
[1:29:36] find our gifts the questions about gifts
