the glory anoint us Jesus for thy glory in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen amen praise God let's stand and take our Bibles let's go to Romans here uh 6 verse 22 I'd like to preach my Christmas message U as part of my book of Romans series I just saw kind of like a a nice connection here so I like to go to Romans 6:22 we'll read Romans 7:4 so P Romans 6 vers so I'm going to just start preaching on Romans to kind of tie this in and then at the end I'll just preach on this little thought room for Jesus that's my Christmas thought is room for Jesus so we're thankful we can have make room for Jesus praise the Lord let me see if there's any other prayer requests here okay that looks good all right Romans 6:22 let's read that if we can and then we'll read Romans 74 after this here by God's grace thank you let's read that on three 1 two three but now being made free from sin and become servants to God your H and the end everlas life just for a moment the main thought I want to pull out of here is the fruit and that's what brother random emphasizes when he preaches uh the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ he preaches Christians should have fruit to their Union with Christ uh so verse 4 of chapter 7 let's read that one 1 2 3 wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that he should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God God as blessing to reading his word you may be seated we only have one service today so I'm really not going to keep track of time I'm not even to set my timer today I'm just going to just try to preach as long as I or as long as the Holy Spirit wants me to by God's grace so um and then at the end you after we sing and if there's any prayers you know we can pray and then we'll invite the children up and uh you know just talk to them a little bit about little gifts you know um I told my older ones I told Haven you know um let's let's make sure we give The Junction City children these gifts first okay we'll get now whatever ones we got we'll give them to the youngest first come first serve and believe me I'll make it up to you older ones by God's grace God will help me I'll make it up to you because we want to we want our guest to feel the love of God and they sacrificed so much to be here we want these little children to feel of God's love Hallelujah so we want to look at um I I have some uh slides here got a few slides ready I want to look at this thought of uh Book of Romans this idea brother Ram brings it out bringing forth fruit unto God and so uh brother Ram brings it out as a marriage he uh I'm sorry St Paul brings it out as a marriage and then brother Ram takes that thought and brings it down to our day so we want to look at Book of Romans is part 14 in our Romans series also at the end I'll look at just a simple thought room for Jesus and so again Merry Christmas to everyone and God bless your holiday season I hope you get to see your family and loved ones by God's Gra I've been on vacation for a few days I'm enjoying this and I hope you're enjoying some vacation time as well by God's grace so we read our text here and I found this or one of my children shared this with me I thought it was just a funny way to kind of maybe start out not just a funny but true this is a true thing we've been preaching on the book of Romans and and this is how it is with me almost every verse I can highlight and say wow that's powerful that's powerful I hope you can say amen after the first uh 13 parts of this series I hope you can say Amen to this because that is the absolute truth you can just go over so many truths in the Book of Romans who was it oh as my barber was telling me a couple weeks ago he said uh said you know I was thinking about you this morning and uh he said uh I was reading through Romans and I I just kept coming back you know all these things I've heard from you I just kept kept coming back to the Book of Romans there's something about the book of Romans and uh it's a true of course because God's Prophet messenger St Paul he brought so much Unity to Christian Jews and Christian Gentiles in this book he answers all the questions uh and it goes from how we're all guilty before God but then God can bring Jew and Gentile together in the Holy Ghost praise God Amen so it doesn't matter your nationality doesn't matter your age your gender there's only two genders doesn't matter anything like that we are all one in Christ Jesus Hallelujah you have the Holy Spirit and I have the Holy Spirit we are the family of God hallelujah amen and if we both obey the Holy Spirit we'll have Unity of the spirit God that's what we enjoy today praise God but I just thought you like that that made me laugh because that's exactly what my Bible looks like I just switched out my Bible so I got my new one up here so it doesn't quite look the same this is my newer one I took my old one home I'm transfering all my my note my special notes and highlights out of that one I'm putting in my new one so I like to do that that's been 14 years since I had that Bible so I like to transfer them over now remember uh scopio Ram likes a lot of Scofield's teachings but scoffield broke this book up into eight or seven Parts we're on part three we're looking in chapter 5 through 8 on crucifixion with Christ and the Believers walk in the Holy Spirit praise God so we're looking at that today we're looking at the walk in the Holy Spirit this section of uh Paul's letter to the Romans remember I'm just going to read a couple of these I'm not going to read all of them but brother R said every time I got feeling a little depressed I turn to the Book of Romans chapter 4 so if you ever get depressed May the Holy Spirit remind you read Romans 4 praise God the Bible says that Abraham hoped against uh I'm sorry he believed uh he hoped yeah he believed in Hope praise God the Bible said he was not weak in faith so when we feel weak in faith remember God doesn't see you as weak in faith amen God knows you're going to get weak God knows you're going to struggle God's going to come to you and he's going to strengthen you if you did that with Abraham he's going to do it with you because you're Abraham's spiritual children am hallelujah thank you Jesus and Abraham didn't consider his body dead because he looked at the promise of God the promise said I'm going to give you a new body the promise is to us God's going to give us a new body at the Rapture amen praise God so we got that promise Hallelujah so let's not be weak in faith Hallelujah God's going to get us ready for the Rapture amen when I first came in the message back in 2001 I thought oh I don't have enough time to make it ready for the Rapture now look I've had now look at all this time I've had all this time to get ready for the Rapture if you want to go in the rapture God's going to give you time to get in the Rapture amen he will not leave one person behind that really wants to be in the Rapture just like with Noah AR now that it's not a type of the Rapture but it's a type of being saved God won't let Destruction come until every single believer has a safe place hallelujah amen so God makes sure every believer is rescued from the impending judgment upon the Earth praise God the Bible said God will not suffer the righteous to be uh destroyed with the wicked Hallelujah God will always rescue the Believers Hallelujah when the worldwide wrath of God comes on God will always rescue the Believers I love this I love this Abraham didn't consider oh my body's dead Sarah's dead we're past the years of of procreation he didn't consider that because he looked at the promise of God hallelujah amen he staggered not so when God looked at Abraham he didn't stagger because he kept pressing on through the battles Hallelujah he kept believing God he kept praying to God he kept conf confessing the promise of God hallelujah that's what we must do we must just confess the promise of God we must remember God's word hallelujah and God look down at us and when God writes the story of Our Lives it'll say John never stagger at the promise of God Amen brother amen and sister who they never Str staggered at God's promise amen sister Naomi and beus they were strong giving God glory amen amen I can call each one of your names amen amen and brother said you know there's certain things Paul wrote In the book of r that other Christians couldn't handle I want to be such a mature Christian that God can give me any word amen that he knows I can handle any promise of God hallelujah I don't want to be a baby Christian where God's got to Baby me on well come on baby let's just try to believe you'll make it through the trials you'll make it through the Rapture you you'll make it through 2024 I don't want to be a baby I want to be a mature believer praise God and this is what the the Romans were and so were the Ephesians but said God couldn't teach those Corinthians the deeper things of God they were just a baby fashioned kind of church but he couldn't go to those great deep messages that he did to the Ephesians and the Romans because they wasn't able to take it now let's just have faith this morning uh let's have the the confidence of God in our heart that we're mature mature Christians and God can uh he can take us through whatever he can take us through and we'll still praise the Lord I was in contact with this message believer I don't remember where he's from uh he was a father of two boys and now the uh and one of the boys was a a famous boy in their little town I forget what it was I don't know if he was an athlete or what he was anyways he was a message believer and this young teenager died in a car accident and he was such a famous guy there a young teenager I think it was 18 years old that that the uh the the the TV station the local TV station came down to interview his father and they asked him about you know the accident and you know his favorite memories and the TV station put put on the TV and they said what's your last words you want to tell this community and his dad looked at the camera he's crying he said the Lord gives and the Lord takes away amen he said blessed be the name of the Lord the church that's the kind of mature faith that real Christians should have Hallelujah that's not a baby Christian right you know if God chooses to take our children or God chooses to do something that we don't understand the mature believer the Deep Christian says God gives and God takes away God brought me here who am I anyway praise God who am I what do I deserve anyway I don't deserve nothing God's already saved me he's already given me Grace hallelujah amen whatever God allows he's wise enough he allowed it and he'll guide me safely home praise God Amen if I lose somebody on this side surely I'll be you reunited on that side hallelujah it's coming a great reunion day hallelujah it's the hope of eternal life Hallelujah I just was so blessed by that that wasn't some baby you know no doubt I'm not saying it's it's it's it's normal to be sad it's normal but I'm talking about look at the faith that's that's that's job Faith right that's job level of patience Hallelujah that God could allow you to be tested in the greatest measure and you still come out praising God Amen I was reading yesterday you know how or the day before how David after his uh adultery you know he even went and fasted and prayed for that child right and the Bible said as soon as the child died everybody was all upset what's going to David do to himself what is he going to do to himself now he's he's fasting all these days and the Bible said he washed himself and he went up to the church and he started praising God may God help us to do that in our hardest moments when we don't feel like going to church may we come to church and give God glory Hallelujah because that's what a man or woman after the heart of God does they're they're they're they're strong enough in their faith praise God they got enough confidence in God to know that if God allowed it he'll bring me through it amen yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil Hallelujah Your Rod and your staff are comforting me praise God Amen I'm a sheep he's a Shepherd he's he's he's he's directing my path Hallelujah he's taking care of me he knows the beginning from the end hallelujah amen and his word cannot return void amen that was in my notes I don't know who that's for so amen PR for all of us now if you got your Bibles let's go to Romans 41 sorry Romans 71 sorry Romans 71 Glory now look at verse one I just got a few thoughts here know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth now let's back up to verse 23 because remember in chapter 6 chapter 6 is about the promises of God you're given after your water baptized that's why I'm looking at my Jun City friends they're all baptized this year amen so it might be a good blessing for you go back going read Romans 6 Romans 6 lays out all the blessings of being baptized and what it means spiritually you were baptized into his death so you will be raised in his life amen hallelujah because you joined him by water baptism because you went down the water you will come up in the resurrection hallelujah praise God these are Divine Promises of God hallelujah this word cannot return void Hallelujah it'd be easier for on Earth to pass away than for one of these words to fail hallelujah amen God's word cannot fail hallelujah amen if you be dead with Christ you shall live with him also the Bible says amen but remember verse 23 this is a very famous verse many people memorize this verse in the message and outside the message we memorize it at bible Club at the little uh the elementary Bible Club lot of the kids call on this one real fast for the wage of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord praise God so these gifts children in a moment you know the these represent the gift that God gives to you right Victoria and is jenab here this morning oh there she is so jev didn't do any work for me to give her these gifts right she's only five what work could she do you know she might scrub the floor a little bit you know she might get some work done you know but there there's no they didn't earn it it's just from my heart praise God Amen that's how every real gift should be from the heart praise God Amen and then you know as a child as we know children will be really happy and uh they'll be so happy for the gift they'll want to hug daddy or something like that wink wink maybe they'll want to obey daddy and mommy no better when they get home they do a good job but you know what I'm talking about um it's a free gift salvation is a free gift so the rest of our lives After we receive salvation after we're baptized in water the Bible says we labor out of our love for God Amen because it's we receive the gift oh I remember the gift when I got saved and now everything after this it's just a it's a blessing to serve God Amen think about that God gave me the gift of Salvation now it's a blessing for me to take up my cross and follow him amen he saved me and now he says take up a cross and stop living for yourself am I'm preaching to myself I'm preaching myself stop living for yourself Jesse live for other people that's what I'm talking about amen so we're so thankful for the gift of salvation but now we need to learn how to die to ourselves so Christ can live through US amen so notice here in verse one I just these are just my notes from this morning's study the law had dominion over all of us the law it was the curse of the law that was so awful uh because the law forced you to be justified by your Works rather than faith in other words there's 613 Old Testament laws right and each one of them you better do and and if not then you you're cursed by all of it if you don't keep one of them the Bible said you're cursed by all of them and so it's constantly like oh I'm doing good for the last 10 minutes right and then I make a I make a sin or I did good the the first morning but then this afternoon I really struggled loving my neighbor you know it was constantly happy depressed happy guilty right joyful guilty joyful full of shame it was this back and forth all day now we experience that to a degree but the Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ does more for us in Hebrews 10 the Bible said we do not have a guilty conscience amen that's the difference with the blood of Jesus Christ we don't have to have the weight of of our guilty conscience as this chapter shows us our past life is dead it say dead is a doornail praise God Amen it's completely separated it's it's completely forgotten brother said all your sinful Works were in a book and they were thrown in the sea of forgetfulness never to be found amen so that is different now we have that conscience now he saved me he forgave me there's no more condemnation to me am Hallelujah yes I got to confess my sin but all that P all the Gil and shame all the curse have been taken away the Bible plainly tells us this as many of the works of the law are under the curse so see that that's a legalism right our Junction City friends were under and and some of us each one some of us in in other ways were under that right for us in the for us in the Assemblies of God the legalism was you got to speak in tongues that was the legalism I was raised under if you don't speak in tongues you're really not even Sav that's that's the that's what I was under now I didn't care because I was a sinner you know I once I got got saved I started to care yeah I walked in that class with the pastor I said pastor I know you're trying you went through all these things about tongues and I said pastor can I show you 1 Corinthians 12 and it said do all speak in tongues and of course the answer is no I said well Pastor what about that he said well Jesse he said uh this is just what we believe I said okay I'm not joining the church have a good day I didn't even know the message at that point but I had enough understanding no the Bible's right you can speak with a million tongues and everything but if you don't have love it don't profit you nothing am there might be tongues of men and angels amen you might speak in the language of Gabriel right or wormwood that don't matter if you don't know the love of Jesus Christ when Jesus said if you love me keep my commands amen if you don't have that love it does you no good praise God amen amen so see I I thought I'd bring that in there that there's always legalism to every denomination not just Amish it's even in the Assemblies of God it's even in the CMA buddy right for it's written cursed is everyone that continueth not the things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law of the sight of God it's impossible for you to earn salvation that's a blessing that's that should make you say amen amen it's evident for the just shall live by faith amen faith is a substance of things hoped for it's an Evidence of not of Things Not Seen so we don't live by our works wow look what I've done today we live by the substance of faith in our hearts hallelujah or in our souls that's what we live by I'm saved by my faith in what God already did amen he's already saved me amen he's already revealed himself to me that's what I'm saved by I I'm saved by My Sacrifice hallelujah amen Glory the just shall live by faith not by his Works amen and the law is not of Faith legalism is not of Faith because it's I earn this I earn this I earn this you ever hear somebody give a testimony and say oh when I got saved I did this and then I did that they kind of got they're kind of clouded in their minds when I got saved the Bible said the goodness of God led me to repentance I got saved God finally let me wake up and recog that his will is I love that song sister n was saying one one time his will is stronger than my will that's why I got saved amen I'm undone by the mercy of Jesus Amen so we talk about salvation it's about what Christ did not what I did amen I just finally died out I just finally said okay I'm going to stop fighting against God I'm going to stop fighting against heaven and now I'm going to let Heaven Come Into Me Hallelujah God that's why I got Sav amen because is stronger than me amen glory the law is not of Faith the man that doth them shall live in them Christ has redeemed us now look at this I love this verse if you ever think and sister Z and I were texting about this well I guess a little bit about cursing and everything like that I love this I'm already bought bought back from the curse of the law so the curse of the law is I'm not good enough I haven't kept all the commands that's the curse of because you broke one you're guilty of all them that's what the Bible says but Christ bought me he paid the price that I am out of that condemnation he redeem means to buy back right so Jesus purchased us with his blood the Bible says right amen and now I'm no longer cursed you're no longer curse amen cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree so Jesus took our curse he kept all the law amen right he paid the penalty for all of our sin all of our sin were was placed upon him the Lamb of God and now there's no more curse on us amen now will we get spanked if we make a mistake yes but that doesn't mean we're cursed amen I'm blessed amen the Bible said you are blessed you are not cursed anymore you are blessed now Hallelujah because of what Christ did amen standing on the word amen I don't care what Satan says Satan didn't write the Bible God wrote the Bible am Satan's the father of lives God the father of Truth amen I choose to believe Christ hallelujah amen I'm not under the curse of the law anymore yes I I I want Jesus to say Well done good and faithful servant but that's out of my daily dying right that's out of my appreciation it's not that I'm going to earn it it's impossible for me to earn it right talk about a Christmas message I sure where all this came from Romans 2:7 I'm Sor Romans 7:2 for the woman which ha a husband look look at this interesting Paul goes from chapter six to baptism and then he goes into a type of marriage see when you got baptized you were coming under the headship of your husband spiritually right amen right some of our sisters aren't married right some our brothers here are maybe not married young especially the younger ones but it's that's what happens spiritually when you get baptized you're choosing Christ to be your head Your Leader amen your ruler am that's what Lord means ruler Master amen hallelujah amen how many enjoy getting uh uh directions from your master yes I'm me enjoy instructions from the Great Master amen Jesus that's where we got this Bible for amen hallelujah that's why he gives us dreams and visions and Revelations praise God because he wants to give us instruction on how to serve him Hal hallelujah amen amen for the woman ha I'm sorry which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of her husband so the law being under the law the curse it's liken unto a marriage partner now that doesn't sound like a good marriage partner to be married to right and it's it's liken unto a male so the law was like a male uh husband and then we're liken to as a body of Believers we're like it unto a woman right and this Dominion lasts until death loosening only happens at death Hallelujah right so once a man or woman dies in a marriage that person is totally free now to marry whoever they want or they can remain single praise God right but death death is the only thing that allows someone to leave that Covenant right verse three is confirms it now Paul confirms this still lasts that was the Old Testament that still lasts in the New Testament amen hallelujah verse three so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she should be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she' be married to another man now we see that in America it's it's rampant so many people are married a second time third time fourth time after that they just stopped getting married because there's they realize they're a failure right at keeping their promises right but this is what Paul tells us that this is why so many people will not inherit the kingdom of God just because of their marriage choices right adulterers fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God and what is the kingdom of God the Holy Ghost amen amen it's Luke 17 Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you Hallelujah there is a future Kingdom to come but if someone wants to have the kingdom now if they want to work for the kingdom now they must be married the right way praise God Amen that's the power of the institution of marriage and the natural the natural is given to us here Paul tells us the power of a natural marriage but there's a spiritual application here as well we are under the law we're under legalism but now legalism has died amen amen legalism has died now we live by faith Hallelujah now we're married to faith in Christ Jesus amen amen Glory verse four says wherefore my brethren you are also become dead to the law by the by the body of Christ amen that ye should be married to another amen even to him who raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God amen glory so the Bible says plainly that when we become a Christian when we after we got baptized we're you know our old law our old curse our old life of legalism is dead and if it dies it sure ain't coming back amen there's no Resurrection for death in the Bible amen hallelujah amen glory that old life the old curse all the condemnation is now gone you are loose in Jesus Christ's name amen like Jesus told that woman woman thou art loose can I say this bride of Jesus Christ you are loose from the curse of the law praise God you are loose from your past you're loose from your sins you're loose from your guilt and your shame you are loose in Jesus Christ name Hallelujah that's not what I said that's what the Bible say am and now this is the beautiful part brother brings us out when he preaches this sermon uh the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ in November 65 he's preaching on Thanksgiving day he shows how when we're born again we now have a spiritual union with with Christ we're married to him by our soul our soul is married amen isn't that why you love to pick up your Bible in the mornings is that like is that why you like to sing at your homes and have prayer time because I'm United with that amen amen I'm in love with Christ amen oh that's why I like to sing to him that's why I like to read his love letter to me sister vress amen I like to read his love letter Oh you mean Jesus you love you love me this much amen you wrote me this big long love letter right I read every phrase brother Austin and I keep reading it every day I want to know his entire Love Letter what did he say to me CU I know he loves me amen my old my old spouse is dead the law is dead it's dead it's gone but now I got a new spouse it's Christ hallelujah it's the way the truth and the life amen amen our husband took our curse that was on us upon himself and then he gives us the blessing he was cursed all sin was placed upon him that all the blessing might be placed upon us Galatians 3:14 that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that me we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith so what is the blessing the Holy Spirit filling up the Holy Spirit anointing us the Holy Spirit leading us not not not a not a a seat of discrepancy not the Antichrist Spirit but the Holy Spirit praise God brother said if you got the Holy Ghost it'll always point you back to the word of God aren't you glad you always go back to the word of God who gets the final say on your life who who gets the final say on your decisions the word of God that's a good sign you're born again amen hallelujah this is the blessing I'm not under a curse I'm I'm under the blessing Hallelujah I'm married to Christ Jesus I'm United to Christ in my soul amen that's right now I want to emphasize this brother emphasizes fruit through the union with Christ so Paul says you're not married to legalism anymore you're not saved by your works the church saiden although you should be zealous for good works one guy accused me of that he said you're a legalist this week you know I made a video or something he said you're a legalist I said you misunderstood I'm not I'm not saved by my works I'm just zealous for good works right I said you only use one verse there's other verses you forgot about there's a lot more verses in that love letter that he forgot to read that's right I know I'm not saved by my works it's impossible right I'm saved by faith amen but then the Bible says when you're saved by faith you're created unto good works amen that's the reason I was created to find out what God wants to do with me praise God amen amen amen so brother emphasizes now that you're married to Christ you should bring forth fruit so it speaks of spiritual fruit right like a wife would bring forth children it's called the fruit of the Union right and so brother breaks into that in this sermon if we're married to Christ we should see some fruit spirit fruit brought forth amen I love it it's a beautiful thought really is that's why it's such a memorable sermon that's why so many preachers take so many good quotes out of here it's such a beautiful thought and think of that it was a Thanksgiving sermon you should be thankful that your old spouse is dead and now you're married to Christ Hallelujah who can never die again amen GL the law could die Christ died once but now he lives forever more praise God never to die again Hallelujah so brother used Romans 7 1-4 as part of his text when he preached invisible union now earlier this year if you remember right before we went to Brother cams in a April I felt let the Lord to preach on that I preached on as though you never did it in the first place because brother ad preaches this message and he says if your old husband is dead then he says there's no more record of that husband right the husband's dead you're completely loose from your past brother said when you come to Christ you're saved in such a way it's as though you never did those sins in the first place amen now we all know we did them we all know we s in the past but he says it's as though in other words God's forgiveness is so great that God even forgets your sins God won't bring them up amen your new husband won't bring it up to pass amen hallelujah how'd you like that if you had a new spouse right and they kept bringing up uh well I was married to this person well I wish you were more like that person Jesus don't do that to us amen we should do it to Jesus amen hallelujah amen would that be a happy home well my other husband he he was a lot more handsome than you or vice you whatever it would just be awful but Jesus forgives all of our pasts amen amen we got a freshed our new creation New Life New Beginning Hallelujah that's what Jesus does Amen now and just so you understand that I I wanted to show the balance uh 1 John 3:9 so let's read that first John 3:9 well it's a good atmosphere in here I really appreciate the polling on the word of God I just felt Victory as soon as I walked out the door here so thank you the amen all the song specials really enjoyed that uh first first John 3:9 if the devil ever condemns you take him back to this verse that's what I do of Amen brother we go to Romans 4 I kind of go to First John 3:9 wink wink that's kind of where I go because I need to tell the devil I the real me never sin in the first place the real me the part of me that came out of God because I came from somewhere right you know I was going through all these old pictures this week and signs like where am I daddy where am I he wasn't born yet how do you explain to a three-year-old where he was at before he got here it's hard to do so I just say Zion you were in God you were in God in heaven the Bible said we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world praise God so God said he just dramatized it God has a photo album in his mind of all the saints down Through the Ages and there's a picture of you in there amen and God takes it out and you know uh God takes it out around the the Year 1980 says okay it's time for Jesse here's what he looks like now it's time for him to come down through the uh the realm of his mother and father and I didn't even know it but God already had a record of me in heaven praise God said now it's time for him to come down and each person was s down at the right time in season oh God wanted you here right now cuz God wants to use you as his workmanship for God's glory hallelujah amen it's a photo album of his many membered bride his Gentile bride Hallelujah so if the devil tells you all these lies take them back to 1 John 3:9 who soever is born of God does not commit sins amen for his seed remains in him he cannot sin because he's born of God this is speaking of the Soul Your Soul cannot sin if God's in there because that Soul came from God right your flesh sins your mind sins but the soul can not sin remember two chapters earlier the Bible said If any man said he don't sin he's a liar so we can't say I never sinned in my flesh that's where you sin you have to say I Sinn in my flesh I sin in my mind but there's a part of me that never did Sin Hallelujah that's the part Jesus married amen that's the part he wants to marry that's the union with Christ you have in your soul praise God Amen so take the devil back there well devil yes my flesh sinned my mind sin but my soul never did Sin and Jesus already paid the price for all my fleshly sins amen amen hallelujah amen that's what the word of God says y so see that moment where the word of God comes in you that's where you recognize wow I did come from Heaven that's according to 1 Peter 1:23 so turn there 1 Peter 1:23 I want our Junction City Saints to see that by God just and a refresher for all of us aan Saints cuz we're we're all God's Saints hallelujah amen 1 Peter 1:23 have't putting my sermons that I preach at your place I've been putting them online and people are really enjoying them and they they people put on their comments they're like we love to see God Work amongst the Amish and bring them out of the Amish community I said so do I it's new to me it's really wonderful I have to delete I have to delete a lot of comments cuz you people will put all these comments like try to bring all these accusations against brother Brandon I said I already dealt with that I don't want your trash on there they said why do you delete my comments because I wouldn't let you come into my house and spread manure all over my house so I don't want your manure comments on my YouTube channel put them on your own channel I said put them on your own channel if you want them I'm have going to take your lies on there they call it research no it's a slander from Satan is what it is cuz it's not a balanced research it's a slander and a lie from Satan himself anyone that listened to brother R would know he's a real Christian hallelujah thank God what brother do points us back to Romans 7 AM points us to First John 3:9 so we can overcome Satan and all his lies and tricks Hallelujah 1 Peter 1:23 I like to throw that in there every service 1 Peter 1:23 being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever am so when you receive the word of God God's spirit came into you and that Spirit never sin in the first place that spirit is called God's seed or God's life God's genetics and now God's life is in you Hallelujah that life never did it it cannot sin it will be your Eternal lifeall what a Christ thank you Jesus Hallelujah brother R says first joh 2:15 he said if you love the world the things of the world the love of God is not even in you that's the Bible right how can you be pregnant not and look he's using this example for Romans 7 you were married to sin or the law legalism now you're married to Christ in other words if you're married you're going to get pregnated right normally he said how can you be pregnated with the word of God which condemns the world condemns Hollywood condemns all this fashion all the parties and carryed on and so calleded that they have the name of religion the word of God condemns it how can the word pregnate a person how can a bob haired woman painted face wearing shorts you think Jesus is going to marry something like that no now can they be saved yeah they don't know better once they know better now they're accountable you we're looking at old pictures again like I told you and Zion you know we had old pictures of Chris and I when we first started dating because we didn't know about cording and she had makeup all over and sign's like is that makeup Daddy mommy I'm like yeah that's makeup he's like is't that wrong I said yeah Mommy Didn't Know Better M once she found out she took off all the makeup amen hallelujah praise God once I found out mention I have long hair I cut off my uh what was it called my I cut off my mullet Hallelujah I didn't know man shouldn't have long hair those pictures are so ridiculous that's the old guy that died don't see him Around Much Anymore how can a preacher out goes who goes to s one guy told me you need to go to Seminary I'm like no I need to go to uh I need to get some more neology on my knees with the Bible open that's what I need you need to believe acts 238 how can a preacher go to Seminary look at acts 238 and see there's not a person in the Bible ever baptized in those titles father Holy Ghost and then still say he's pregnated by the word of God telling you a lie and that's something right there they're telling you a lie I Bob my hair I paint my face I wear shorts I've been baptized father the Holy Ghost and I'm pregnated by the word no sir you have not yet been pregnated by the word because when the word comes in you it produces the life of the word hallelujah it produces fruit of the word of God hallelujah I love pulls us out of Romans 7 oh he's a prophet of God hallelujah amen he said you tell the LIE he sold his Birthright he's committed adultery against very thing that he said he's put away in divorce isn't that what God did the denominations he divorced them just like he divorced Israel every time of denomination refuses to get more of the word of God God divorces them and goes on to the next move right but what are we we are really just Advanced Lutheran that's all we are we're just Lutheran that receive Martin Luther but then we Advanced on and then weed John Wesley and then I became a method meist Hallelujah but I didn't stay at methodism then I went to isusa Street where I received the truth on the gifts of the holy spirit right but I didn't stop there because there was an eagle time coming hallelujah hallelujah there's an eagle anointing coming from this hour Hallelujah that's right Jesus said where the Eagles are that's where the carcass is Hallelujah at the end time my eagl will be gathered around the word of God feasting on the fresh word of God hallelujah what are you brother Jessie I'm a Lutheran Methodist Pentecostal Holy Ghost fill message believer that's what I am amen that's a mouthful so I just tell people I'm I'm a holy ghost filed Christian amen and we believe William Brandon was a prophet of God that's why I tell him I'm a holy ghost feel Christian and William Brandon was our Prophet y amen that's the easiest way to sum it up rather than saying I'm a I'm a Lutheran Methodist Pentecostal message believer instead of all that just have a holy ghost feel Christian We Believe William Ry was God's Prophet to this hour Hallelujah but God puts away the denominations God is going to have a virtuous church just exactly a bride amen the Bible said the word is not in you speaking of the denominations so what kind of children are you bearing pregnated denominational there's been no death to separate you from your first lover look at that brother brings it back to Romans 7 your old denomination your old life of sin has to die so you can be married to Christ amen amen and do you know brother Marlon John do you know brother Marlon who's up there up north by Strongsville he's a former Amish he had a burden on his heart a few weeks ago he emailed me and said he said keep the Amish up there in your prayers there's a lot of abuse in the communities so let's keep praying for these these friends by God's grace what the reason they do that is because they're still married to denomination right but if we keep praying if we keep spreading the message some of them are going to get saved Hallelujah all that the father has given me will come amen hallelujah All God's Children are going to come to him everyone that was in God's photo album is going to receive the word of God hallelujah amen said what will the Joneses think if I go to crying and speaking in tongues what would they think if I'm re-baptized brother said what a nonsense are you married to the Jones are you married to the church or are you married to Christ the word what will my mom say what will my dad say who cares what does your husband Christ say Amen you're not married to your mom you're not married to your grandpa you're not married you're married to Christ Hallelujah Glory now that's why she's still bearing children the denominations what kind of children does she have here are some of the names they call themselves today cats beetles monsters Ricky rickettes what do they call them today man okay what they call themselves today online Chads Chads Chads Chads they call them Chads today I was thinking of another one what do they call him uh I forget I can't remember he said that's church member sure oh they call themselves woke what else do they call them they call woke uh I can't think of it they're probably com to me at the end of the service when I don't need sh he said they're all his sons look sons of Cain sons of the subtle Beast just as smooth as they can be and don't don't you see that these preachers that are against brother R they're as smooth as can be but it's just like the serpent smooth as can be he's smooth he was just so smooth and telling Eve everything she needed to hear and here we got preachers now some of those are not pretty smooth but but here I'm spitting all over the place and stuttering and there's nothing really smooth about me praise God probably should have shade this morning I don't have time for that I gotta study but look uh they're so trendy you know they they satisfy the trends I love that we're the we're bible-based church I don't care what trend comes over Society whether it's woke or whether it's this life matters or that Liv matters we stay true to God's word Society doesn't change us what we do is pull out people out of society and bring them and be married toes Jesus Christ Glory Glory Society doesn't impact us we change individuals in the society amen bring them out of that Society bring them into Christ Society amen hallelujah let me call him brother and sister right Amen brother Malachi brother am brother Jose we call him brother and sister amen take a good look for a moment with your own spiritual Insight at your soul just look around I'm speaking Across the Nation now just just look a few minutes you out there in Bram Tabernacle you in the out the Tabernacles on the west coast Arizona wherever you're at look at yourself for a few minutes you say the message you're preaching mother BR is wrong look at yourself a little bit look let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the word and you'll agree with this message hallelujah amen let Christ the anointed word search out your own conscience let him get into you and see if that's not right or not that's just one or two of the things I mentioned when there's hundreds of them now notice brother raham says if you would just take some time and look at the Bible you would see the message is right now I have a video there's four scriptures that condemn make maybe five five sinful Fashions the Bible says modest clothing 1 Timothy 2 they deny acts 238 late night parties is condemned in 1 Corinthians 6 and Galatians 5 I didn't have time to put up all the verse up there what I'm saying is how can these churches be married to Christ when they break all of his commands and this thought struck me a while ago brother said there's hundreds of them there's hundreds of differences between the bride of Christ and the Bride of Satan yes there's lots of differences right now what interesting brother John is that Jesus said to be so close it deceive the very left so that's another thought I just struck me right now I actually didn't have that in my notes hundreds of them yeah here he list he list some more here and I want to open this note real quick I hope this is not boring to you but I want to just I just want to take a little on this I thought this was so inspired brother said there's hundreds of them hundreds of differences between the bride of Christ and the false bride Hallelujah does the bible agree with the woman bobbing her hair the congregation says no does the bible agree with three baptisms one for the father son Holy Ghost no no such thing does the bible agree with women wearing men's clothing or not today men wearing women's clothing well that's just three of them there when there's hundreds more search it out in the light of God's word amen you say I'm a church member so was Kane Kane went to church right he he made a sacrifice he he built an altar right so is Eve he says she met with God when God would come down the cool of the evening Adam and Eve would always meet with God the Bible predicts in the last days the L of SE will be the same now I'm not I'm going to go through this fast I made a list yesterday of 100 differences between us and denominations I made a list it took me about an hour not going to bore you by reading the whole thing but I shouldn't say bore you I'm not going to wear you out I guess that's probably it but there's 10 doctrines in Hebrews 6 1-2 that we have different than denominations and then there's 20 prophetic scriptures that we have different than denominations I listed every one of them if you want to copy Saints I'm going to make a video about this too because that was the Holy Ghost in brother brand saying there's hundreds of differences between us and the Roman Catholic church and all these denominations glory amen in other words some people uh they wouldn't look at us and say well wow they're they're a lot like the Roman they're a lot like the Lutheran no I came out of the Lutheran Church they're a lot like the Pentecostal no there's hundreds of differences between me and the Pentecostal amen other words Jesus has such a separated bride she's way different than the worldly Church amen hallelujah that's up to 20 no now it's up to 30 there's five about salvation the Bap the Holy Ghost there's eight about modesty you know high heels tattoos separate garments thighs or nakedness expensive hair and jewelry uh there's the mysteries of God in there there's Holiness and Doctrine homosexuality no women Angels no women preachers you see how I just you can just build this list so easily right sure Pope is the Antichrist mesic was God in flesh not some priest they think he's some people think he's just a priest it was God right Daniel 70 weeks mark of the beast uh the five elements of the human Spirit Grace can be rejected Grace can be failed the gifts of the Holy Ghost are in operation names can be blotted off of The Book of Life Jesus said so right Spirit of Jezebel Jesus leading captivity captive uh Ms fasting prayers the last sign of the Gentiles that's just a hundred of them now I was almost going to preach all of them to you but I see how I how the service is going I don't want to wear he out but that was so inspired of the Holy Ghost there's hundreds of differences between the message churches and all the other ones righten in other words when Jesus looked at you he said oh you're you're not you're nothing like that other church and I'm not trying to be critical I'm just saying Jesus when he looks at his wife she's way different she ain't even he ain't even attracted to that other church amen Hallelujah you are so different there are so many things different about you thank God that's just the way you look in his photo album hallelujah hallelujah hundreds of differences Hallelujah am no wonder he put the other one away Glory no wonder he called himself a bride without spot without blemish hallelujah amen I want to make a video on that I'd like to get up to at least 200 then I can make the video on it brother said hundreds I can just get to 200 now I know I if I just look at for example if I just look at the RO the Mormon Church brother John if I just looked at the the Mormon Church's website I could find a 100 differences right there I have the I have the Roman Catholic catechism in there it's about a thousand Pages oh I could probably find a thousand differences right you see how he was so inspired of the Holy Ghost amen he didn't have to say thus say the Lord because God was speaking to him at that moment but then we go search it out the Bible said prove all things amen so sometimes he said th say the Lord sometimes he didn't how do you know if he didn't say it Go prove it by the word of God H that's how you know it's still from the Lord Jesus Christ amen glory now look at this spiritual wies submit to your own husbands as unto the Lord so you married women don't go try to obey some other man obey your husband right for the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he's the savior of the body therefore as Christ is subject I'm sorry I'm sorry there forgive me Lord therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything and I just showed you really briefly there's over a hundred things that churches will not submit to to Christ the husband but you will amen amen that's why you're the bride yeah that's right the bride's in the Bible amen John said John the Baptist said whoever has the bridegroom is the bride amen hallelujah amen Jesus wants a bride right who's got hundreds of differences from the world oh my Hallelujah this is what he does and then oh yeah as the church is subject in the Christ why should be in everything so that means everything in the word of God we want to obey amen one guy got on there on my sermons to you guys there in J City one guy got on there said why you preaching so much false Doctrine I said show me one false Doctrine I asked him like four times he still hasn't found one yet I said amen I said the reason you can't find any is cu I didn't preach any false doctr everything I taught Sarah Ruth was right out the Bible Hallelujah is that right now if I I preach something wrong you come tell me and I'll I'll say sorry I've done that before but that's the reason they can't find anything is because I didn't say anything wrong by the help of God not because of me but because of God's spirit God's blessing amen it's God's blessing see only the bride submits to all of the word we have no head but Christ right like when we do questions and answers I can tell you my opinion but really my opinion don't really matter it's what the word of God says that's right and I hope my church I hope our home Church don't take my opinion if it disagrees with the word of God take the word of God Amen you have you don't need my permission you have God's permission obey God not me praise God I'm trying to point you to the word of God the best I can but on things I don't understand I just say Here's my thought but if there's ever disagreement if I'm wrong God forbid I'd be wrong but if I'm wrong then you stay with your husband Christ amen you're not married to me you're married to Christ now there's one quote brother says the pastor is like the husband of the church but there's only one quote he doesn't preach a whole sermon on it and the devil has used that quote to make pastors Lords and tyrants over churches so that's why I don't use that it's it's not really a good type for me it's it's not like that yes you know yes yes the the husband is head of the wife yes yes the pastor The Bishop's head of the church but I'm not a perfect head right I'm not a perfect man right Christ and I'm not the I'm not at the top of the the chain Jesus is the top and the top of him is God amen amen right visible Spirits the top of all of it the heavenly father Hallelujah I thought I laid that in there now he says harand love your wives even as Christ Lov the church and gave himself for that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word amen so just you know uh they didn't take many baths in those days they use a lot of oils right but before they would have a marriage you know remember remember with Esther she had to spend a whole year getting washed and cleansed right to make sure she was just married to that that she just be married to that man she has received no other seed right she only received seed from the husband praise God see and the Bible said the man he's got to get her ready for the wedding praise God hallelujah and the Bible said Jesus washes us with the water of the word right amen uh jenemy fell on on Wednesday night right and she had all this dirt on her she had scrapes on her knee and she was crying I was so sad she feel better now about God but I had to take those cuts in there and I had to go get some soap and wash them out I don't do as good as Mommy does it but I do it okay but I had to get some soap out and that's what Jesus does all of our blemishes and the Bible actually says that God did that to Israel so no doubt God does it to us too God finds us the world's it's like the parable of the Good Samaritan the world leaves us half dead right the CMA left you half dead the assies of God left me half dead but there came along a Good Samaritan am Hallelujah he started cleaning me up amen and then he poured some oil and wine Hallelujah he fill me with the Holy Ghost he gave me wine for Revelation hallelujah amen and they took me to the end and he said I'm paying you whatever you have Hallelujah take care of this guy cuz when I come back I'm going to rescue him out of here hallelujah amen yes so the washed them with the oil and the wine that's why I can pass him for 17 years and it never gets old like like remember Wednesday night we're weeping and crying God just comes around on a Wednesday night and just re shows us a little more glimp glimpse of his love he pours a little more wine in there no you're you're wounded you're hurt this week you had some troubles here pour some wine on that this will cheer you up Amen Let me you're you're you're a little dry out there in the world let me pour some oil on there let me freshen you up a little bit right oh it never gets old because Christ week in week out year in year out washing us cleansing us hallelujah give us fresh Revelation fresh stimulation giving us an anointing Hallelujah we need the anointing praise God oh my is constantly watching us year after year amen sometimes want to bang my head out here it's so wonderful it's such a beautiful plan of God because I'm not married to legalism anymore he's not my husband Christ is my husband I got the blessing of Christ I'm not under a curse I'm blessed amen I can see it in my life oh yeah I even I even emailed my employer and I said thank you for uh covering my insurance there's this big story I forgot to turn in a paper so they're G to find me $3,500 I was seven days late because I just forgot about it and I said could you please have mercy on me and as soon as I saw you know my my stomach sank and then that day God woke up my wife and just allowed her to fast and she said I wonder why I'm fasting today see church we need to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit never know why God make maybe he as you miss a meal don't be discouraged maybe he wants you to pray for somebody so as soon as I text my wife she said oh that's the reason I'm supposed to pray it's going to be all right God has me fasting now I I struggled for a couple weeks are they really going to receive this but eventually he wrote me back and and I said I said Thank you for having mercy on me I said I was so happy I went and danced at church and the woman wrote back and said she said I'm glad you got to celebrate that but see now she knows there's people that dance when God does something great for them it's a chance every Everything is a testimony it's a chance to show how much we love Jesus Hallelujah I'm glad you got to have some celebration I sure did s all over me and dancing and praising the Lord it was sure a celebration Hallelujah Grant it Jesus amen that will always rejoice in what he's done for us am now I want to take a few minutes here I'm almost at my hour and a half just because I got to memorize noon's always an hour and a half so I wasn't keeping track of time but let let's let's close with this now if you got your Bible let's go to Colossians 2 you know in the message you know a lot of people struggle with whether to do Christmas or not and so I just want to read this just so you can see it and I was reminded by a preacher this week I was listening to a preacher I'll share that in just a moment Colossians 2:16 brother R has quotes you know on both sides I believe all the quotes line up I really do um but some people you know they they think it's wrong to give somebody a gift at Christmas time or something like that or even to acknowledge that Jesus was born umans Colossians 2:16 sorry so if there's ever any question about you know whether you can have a holiday or not of course you can have a holiday just make sure no sin gets into it right as brother Bram said what what sin is there in Remembering Jesus was born what sin is there taking one one day out of the Year remembering God sent us the greatest gift he could ever send us amen there's no sin in that right Colossians 2:16 uh let no man therefore judge you in meat or drink or in respect of an holy day so see whatever day you consider holy don't let somebody judge you in that or in the respect of whole day or of the new moon or the news or of the Sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is Christ so the main thing in church if you have a if you have a holiday make sure it's holy it's like tomorrow when the kids open up gifts we're not going to we're not going to sing Jingle Bells we're going to sing Joy to the World Jesus Christ is born we're going to read Luke 2 Matthew 2 maybe Matthew 1 hallelujah it's actually extra worship time amen right it's extra worship time it's a holy day and yes you can Feast on a holy day there's nothing wrong you don't have to fast just because it's a holy day don't mean you have to fast you could but you don't have to it's a chance for me to show my children I love you it's a they love they look forward to this day right it's just whatever you do make sure it's holy yes right make sure it's holy so I made a video about it why I mean brother Bram set up a tree I can't because of how I was raised I just I don't feel like I can do it okay now what I did do I I did buy my daughter a real small Christmas tree it's real small I said there's your Christmas tree I can't do it for myself and she go goes makes you know she decorates a tree now to her I don't blame her for liking a Christmas tree cuz she wasn't raised the way I was raised exactly you know she's been rais in a good home by God's grace I ra a good home but I'm talking about a more holy home right that obeyed more the word of God but brother set up a tree I mean there's nothing wrong with that if you want to do that just don't worship the tree I mean yeah I I don't know anybody that worships a tree I know parents that lie and tell them about Santa Claus and reindeer I know parents that lie don't ever lie and then if you want a full sermon on it I preached that uh five years ago there sister Connie here brother still praying for brother Aon by God's grace I'm sure con's doing well she's always been a faithful saint but that that's the heart of the matter is that whatever you do to memorialize uh Christ's birth just just keep it holy I heard a preacher say this week why can't we remember it when when even angels came down to celebrate it Angels said think about it Hallelujah wise men traveled two years to rejoice in it right if they could rejoice in that if they can remember that why can't we that's a good point brother yeah I like that Hallelujah because Jesus is ultimately still getting all of our worship amen hallelujah now the verse I want to use just as as I get ready to finish up here I don't know how maybe half hour maybe we'll see how it goes she brought Mary brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and the other night we watched it s sound did A Christmas one we watched that was about an hour and a half maybe maybe two hours maybe an hour and a half I think but that's what struck me you know uh the kind of the climax of of of the whole thing was when you know they went toh Bethlehem and they couldn't find any place and they had to go to the this dirty stinking M I'm sorry in no yeah not in it was just a barn kind like a barn yeah and there's these animals all over and the people were like oh you're going to go in there well there was no other choice nobody else would open up their place for the King of Kings yeah nobody else would make any room so he had to go to a place where there was brother said a dirty stinking stable but brother R types that that that stable to to your life God will come down in a dirty life but what he does he actually divorces our old life gets rid of all he comes in and sweeps it out like Matthew chapter 12 Hallelujah he sweeps it all out and gets all that trash out and then he brings himself into there hallelujah it's a clean house and now it's got a a a husband to rule the house praise God Amen the strong man of Faith amen the Holy Ghost rules the house now amen all cleaned out but it's amazing grace he comes to a place that's dirty he comes to a place where he where he will be received now notice brother points out these two things I'm going to read this one more quote here notice how he's wrapped and then notice there's lack of room not enough room for Jesus think about that he they wouldn't make room for Christ that's the way it is today people can't accept speaking with tongues in their Church it would ruin their Creed and you know church here you can speak in tongues at the end of the service fact I'll say like this really you can speak in tongues anytime you want but if we're going to get mature with it you got to save it to the end that's how it's always been here we've never had anybody interrupt service with a tongue but let me tell you like this if the Holy Ghost is on you you can't contain it Let It Go yes we're mature enough to stop service pray we're mature enough and then get back to the preaching I think I don't think that would hinder our service I think that would help our service don't you wow Jesus here hallelujah amen we never had that trouble I should but then it wouldn't be trouble right it wouldn't mean it' be a blessing some Churches say no tongues it ruin their Creed they can't accept Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost and such great Evangelical doctrines of the Bible Apostolic truth why because their Creed condemns it oh how foolish to take the paper package is WRA in and throw the gift away so brother brings it down to like a gift Christ comes in and they they take the the the wrapping but they throw away the gift what's what's the gift the word of God Divine Healing speaking in tongues the gifts of the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the real gift amen but they throw the gift away and just take the wrapping well I'm a Christian I go to church it's Christmas Merry Christmas now they say it without any real conviction in their hearts he said he said like the or the crazy man he took the box and accepted it and throw their gift away that's the way the churches people do today they forget that the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ we just read that Romans 6:23 amen he's rejected as much today as he was then this Christmas night he's just as much rejected as he was the first Christmas night they cannot do it because it disagrees with their Creeds all down Through the Ages we've had the same thing Hallelujah Glory no wonder there was no room for him in the end no wasn't wrapped right it came wrapped with a woman who's pregnant just just a husband and wife with a pregnant wife saying oh I got a child of the Holy Ghost come on when has that ever happened never happened they didn't like how it was wrapped was wrapped in such humility oh born in a manger oh come on he said it wasn't wrapped it had the class the classical paper around it it was wrapped as a gift and the gift from God sent from God a God that they didn't know nothing about they thought they thought the Messiah would come through Caiaphas right or who of course he wasn't even a high priest at that time they thought it come through Herod or or one of the other high priests but it come through a common woman and man out of the house of David poor a poor carpenter yeah he was some big CEO like I know everything it wasn't Elon Musk of today we'd say he just a com Carpenter down there maybe he maybe he just a construction worker maybe he's just a landscaper brother could be maybe he's just a common school teacher they're Diamond dozen I tell my wife I'm just a diamond dozen we're just common people they don't like how it comes wrapped but it's foolish don't look at the rapping look at the gift inside hallelujah amen look at the word of God is packing Hallelujah they claimed they accepted it they claimed they was looking for him but we did not coming the way they was they thought he was coming according to their Creeds that they could not receive God's Gift he was wrapped different he was wrapped up like a baby he was born in a manger he come from poor people he come from a bunch of Fanatics so how could they receive something like that no wonder there was no room for him in the end he didn't come the way they expected him there's no room for him there's no there's no room for him yet in churches they OU him they don't believe it they'll say away with such a thing it's fanaticism we want nothing to do with it it's against our father's doctrines the doctrines of the church the doctrines of our Creeds and our forefathers therefore Christ is just as rejected today as he was back there there's no room tonight in our good churches or big churches or fine churches right like brother said I was listening when I preached there at Junction City brother R said serpent seed is the Killer and isn't that something that's like the very heart of the the birth of Jesus you had to be virgin born it just struck me W the real heart of the Virg of jesus' birth is the fact he was virgin born amen he didn't come by way of a seed line by through man instrumentality right right like Cain come through he was son of the serpent not Son Of Satan son of the serpent now spiritually he was a son of Satan but he wasn't the son of Satan in the natural he was the son of the serpent in the natural right so did Abel Abel came by male instrumentality Hallelujah but that's what it is church as soon as I brought up serpy with with my friends of the Chapel we're done said that's the killer it totally separates you as soon as you bring but it's in the Bible God said the serpent has a seed right the Bible said the fruit is the fruit of adultery she wipes her mouth and said I've done no wickedness it's a fruit adulter is a fruit of adultery right it starts as a sin but it produces the wrong fruit right but look at this there's no room in our religious circles today for a holy ghost meeting right we we we went to the Baptist Church a few times this year because a Baptist preacher invited me to preach at his church now we had some good services but do we have services like we had in Napoleon or some of our other services they're nice Services they're not quite the same you can't get I can tell some of them want the Holy Ghost in there the preacher come up and told me he said we want the Holy Ghost but we don't we don't we don't want to be tongues we know tongues aren't the evidence of the Holy Ghost right so that's why I still go back I feel L of God as long as you don't shut me down I'm going to keep preaching the truth there the people didn't realize with amen I preach the revelation of the baptism of the soul I preached the mystery of Christ Christ to them the hope of glory in their soul and they didn't even realize I preached the message to them they didn't realize hallelujah it's the hidden wisdom of God the hidden wisdom of God we speak it in a mystery hallelujah amen amen it's L right there before him that's why I brought out that those stickers right body I'm sorry Body Spirit soul I brought out these construction I might have right here actually I might use yeah I might I only got two what happened to my third that's too bad Malachi do right the Holy Ghost falls on your flesh you feel good but it's got to go deeper than that right amen then you get it in your mind praise God I got the holy ghost in my thoughts but then you start thinking about the wrong thing once you get it in here the seat of God it doesn't leave it's sealed to the day of your Redemption and that's the seed that cannot sin hallelujah amen that's right right I tried to show them see it's going to take a little longer Lord willing I hope these people I've always thought that brother Paul might come in the message I've always thought that I don't know I'm not God but I sure I'm going to keep preaching if he keeps inviting me if he feels led to have me I feel led to preach Hallelujah they don't want it it now look notice they don't want a holy ghost meeting because it belittles them in other words It embarrasses them church I don't care if God has to embarrass me however he wants me to act I just want to act how God wants me to act amen right I don't care I could care less what anybody says I want I I care what God thinks about me I think I proved that to you I danced around here enough this year I think I proved to I don't really care anybody things I want God to be pleased with my life amen hallelujah amen and this all goes back to christas right they didn't want the Holy Ghost they didn't want God in flesh yeah they didn't have room for that but there's room here this morning now afternoon there's room this afternoon for the Holy Ghost amen amen that reminds of that song we'll make room for Jesus to do whatever he wants am what do you think about that song they don't want it embarrasses them in the sight of the classes of the country it belittles them to think that they have to Humble themselves and come down to the alter to cry to wait there until they're filled with power from on high amen that's I I've always respected sister who and brother amen and different ones Lydia that come down here they just waited till the Holy Ghost fell I've always respected that or the the young people at Napoleon they just waited there till the Holy Ghost fell amen just wait give him some roomen make some room in your life amen amen make some room in your your your your agenda make some make some time in your daily schedule make some room for Jesus that's all he wants amen amen he just wants some room in your life praise God hallelujah he says to rise up from there with newness of light to let women let their hair grow out amen and act like women ought to act to make men throw their cigarettes away like me I used to smoke make me quit my drinking I used to drink treat their families right hope I treated Mal right and everybody Lydia it's too much for them so they hold on to their Creed their church instead of receiving God's Gift God's Christmas gift aren't you glad God's Christmas gift is here today and I'm not talking about orange construction paper God's Gift of the Holy Ghost is here amen he just wants somebody to make room for for him praise God hallelujah amen that's God's Christmas gift what greater gift could you get yeah like I told those I told the Saints there in J City last time just look just look to have some experience where you know the Holy Ghost fell on you and look afterwards look make sure you're a changed person after that that's the Simplicity of it that's the Simplicity maybe brother said you might scream you might shout you might cry you might dance you might speak in tongues he said you know I don't know what to do but something will happen when you get the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah something's going to happen in the Bible sometimes all they did was magnify God glory amen thank you Jesus I magnify you that's all they did they got the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen it's all they did that's God's Christmas gift to us that's the gift the Holy Ghost comes on you and you thank him for the gift Hallelujah you Thank The Giver for his gift Hallelujah and then it'll make you live right right hallelujah how many more I got okay I I told you before I'm not going to wor about not worry about preach they would rather have a Creed than they would a gift rather than the paper than the gift they want the paper sure something that's all tinsel a lot of fuss that they can do about it now here here this is what I found the message and I think this is why so many people which is okay are against trees or something like that now it's not okay to be against a tree but what what I'm saying so many people don't celebrate Christmas because they have so many people in their church this is my opinion pastors have so many people in their church that are clearly not born again but they'll take all that time to decorate a tree all the celebrations the eggnog and the tinsel uh what's those red berries poinsettas mistletoe that's what it is I mean I don't blame some of those pastors if I saw you all doing that I'd blast it too you know I don't know come over your house very much but you saw in my house you might be upset but I I I don't blame some of these you know big bigger preachers you know I I mean with bigger churches if they see people that just sit there the whole time when is he going to get over and yet they get excited about Christmas trees yeah I think God would blast it too MH right the church said amen because they're they're they're rejoicing in the tentel instead of the Holy Ghost praise instead of worshiping God praying amen you guys are see compromised and they rejoice in the tel but they fail to get the real Christmas gift the Holy Ghost amen or like a lot of these compromisers once the children get own up they'll skip church on Sunday to go to the soccer game what a bunch of nonsense that's accepting the tel and of the Christ Christmas gift of the Holy Ghost amen I don't know why this coming on me like that hallelujah amen I can recognize the Holy Ghost is here praise Goden I can recognize something different is here today Hallelujah same here on Wednesday just a little different Channel see so I I don't blame some preachers that would go hard because they look at their dead congregations and they're like why can you have so much energy for tree and presence and you can't come up to the Altar and pray right amen and and these are the same people that complain about marriage problems financial problems because they're spending it on all this nonsense trying to be rich like The Joneses you ain't married to the Joneses Hallelujah you are be married to Christ hallelujah amen amen see now that just struck me today I didn't plan to preach that at all that must have been God right there because it's a it's a it's a further understanding see Jesus was wrapped in a dirty cloth a swaddling cloth he's wrapped today in the same thing hallelujah amen he's called a Holy Roller oh you're just one of those Holy Roller message churches you're just a bunch of Fanatics you're a bunch of heresies yeah according to your definition like Paul said the way I worship is called the way of heresy amen Paul is saying our gift is wrapped in a swalling cloth amen oh you only rent a building you're not big enough Church to have a building okay I understand yes I'm wrapped in the swalling cloth right of rented building and the church said glory amen I'd rather have that than anything I know to be wrapped in the humility of Jesus Christ [Applause] Hallelujah this is good amen hope they got a good recording of this I might need an encouragement someday hallelujah it's wrapped up the world don't want to oh I'm so glad to raise that cloth off look what's laying underneath this rented building amen look what's laying underneath all this slander against brother brand right you know what's laying underneath it the Holy Ghost woo amen amen eternal life God made flesh and he dwell Among Us praise God [Applause] Amen who's dwelling amongst us today it's Jesus Christ am the same yesterday today and forever just take the lid off take take the tinsel off take the wrapping off take the swalling clothes off what is underneath all this eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen amen oh thank you Jesus hallelujah thank you Jesus for giving this thought to brother Brandon it's not my thought he preached that on Christmas that means he was on church on Christmas good he went to church on Christmas and Christmas Eve yeah that's what a real Prophet does praise God he doesn't break the word in order to have his own liberty in celebrations no they didn't want him to interfere with their religious circles to receive it today it interferes with them oh if somebody would raise up in church and start shouting praising God or somebody say amen amen like this group of ministers here or something or in the audience quickly an usher would lead them out to the door I'm so glad we're in a church where you have the full Liberty of the Holy Spirit am you want to dance a little bit there's a corner here there's a corner there you can dance wherever you want and nobody's going to stop you praise Goden be like brother digs you can run over here you can can slam the wall and say praise God hallelujah you got all the Liberty you want praise God Amen to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost praise God to express your love for God to express what eternal life means to you hallelujah amen that's the Liberty you have as a Christian praise God Amen we're not under man's Creed I'm not married to legalistic anymore he's dead yes amen I'm married to Christ amen amen hallelujah I'm a I'm a free man the Bible says we're free men and women amen amen hallelujah I'm free in Christ Jesus he whom the son set free is free indeed I'm enjoy the freedom of the Holy Ghost any time you said Ain time you want to run to this altar you can run to the altar it ain't time amen we'll stop it we'll start praying for you Hallelujah whatever you whatever God's putting on your heart the main thing to do is let the Holy Ghost have his way amen yes Amen in your hearts and lives I was reminded this song we might try to sing this I know this is a difficult song now okay and brother amen I know the course is really hard but I just love this course I love this song down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came in Jesus was the name born in a manger to his own a stranger think about all those Bethlehem businesses and houses none of them would open up think about that the Bible said for a thousand years he'd be born in Bethlehem and when he come there not a one of them would take him in he came to his own and his own didn't even want him the savior of the whole world God bless the inkeeper there that inkeeper said you can have you can have our barn Hallelujah God bless that guy a Man of Sorrows tears and and Agony that was really special about the Sight and Sound Theater too Mar and Joseph were home looking at Jesus and they said we are so thankful they said but he's going to be a man of Sorrows he's going to be a child that's going to grow up and have a lot of Sorrows a lot of Agony they said let's love him as much as we can now before the Trials Come amen first love your children before the Trials Come hallelujah amen amen love them with all your hearts your grandchildren your whatever you got love them before the Trials come oh how I love them how I adore them my breath My Sunshine is is is he your breath church is he your Sunshine is he your all in all he's everything to me brother says everything the great Creator became my savior all God's full one what condescension bringing us Redemption that in the dead of night not one faint hope in sight God gracious tender he laid aside his splendor stooping to woo to win to save my soul don't you love that song yes what I think that was written in 1921 if I'm not mistaken 1921 just a few years after the zja Street Revival somebody got the inspiration about the condensation of Jesus Christ down from his Glory Hallelujah so see church if God could lay aside his glory surely we can lay aside our pride amen we've already had a wonderful service but surely if there's anything else God wants to do surely we can lay aside our pride mhm and let the Holy Ghost have his way amen amen let's stand our feet musicians can come let's take a few minutes let's make room for the Holy Ghost whatever you'd like to do in our life maybe you need prayer today Hallelujah I don't

praise your would be wonderful yes our two little girls aren't with us today went with grandp but we had this spring when she got her hand in the meat grer I used anyway I don't want to take the up it take tell the story but God told me and Carol both that we would not pay a scent of that bill and and uh so anyway between the helicopter ride and the hospital bill I think it was what 160,000 and uh we were trusting in God totally for didn't have insurance and uh and so people gave I mean just God just moved people and I think we received what was it 9,000 right at $9,000 and the bills started coming in and U of course uh they told us they would do a like a self-pay discount thing and I filled out a a a thing that they said well we're below poverty level I guess for them so they said well they'll they'll give us a a p cut or whatever and uh but it looked pretty you know it looked absolutely impossible but uh I just to make a really long story short the other day I would call every and say you know when is this bill last bill coming because I I want to know and uh so from March till the other day finally they sent the last bill and they sent the thing that had all the bills together at what we were supposed to and we had paid $683 earlier in the in May or some time and uh then my brother advised me to wait till I received all the bills and so I did and so they send another thing of um was it anyway the the total bill all together we paid right at $7,500 I mean I Just Want To Praise God because not only did he I mean our church was going to was waiting till we received the bill because they wanted to help and uh they didn't even need to because we had more than enough and I just I just I can't keep quiet about that and I just want to praise God and there's I mean there's if there ever was a question in my mind if there was a God that cared you know and I now for a new hand I mean I I you know people look at me and think I'm crazy I mean I probably am to almost run death I just I praise God it healed I mean healed good she she's not really even handicapped but she does only have that one finger on that hand and it says all things are possible to down that belief and I mean I haven't read if that excludes the four F that she doesn't have so I don't think that this I think anyway I just want to praise God and I want to thank him for healing that hand and thank him for for the hand I mean it was his from the start so that was amen let's thank the Lord [Applause] [Music] God it's more than enough for us Church he's got more than enough praise God have a
