[44:03] I celebrate

[44:08] 14 years of services here how powerful
[44:12] that
[44:13] and what a blessing to be a partaker in
[44:16] this this morning as well as in the past
[44:18] I know I know I I could never have been
[44:23] molded the way I need to be if God had
[44:25] not brought brother Brooks along in my
[44:28] life and then right in the path it was
[44:31] even supernaturally confirmed I was
[44:33] there and at Bible believers and God
[44:37] told me to go to go to Akron and I said
[44:40] what I said okay I guess Lord that's
[44:42] what you want me to do and so I called I
[44:45] called the the Craig up and he was
[44:47] wanting me to do some bigger hand in the
[44:50] youth over there and I said I'm not
[44:52] calling to tell you that I'm taking that
[44:53] I'm calling to tell you that I'm leave
[44:54] and he said brother cam he said how he
[44:56] said how ironic that is he said I was I
[44:58] was the drinking cup of coffee with my
[45:00] wife this morning just something this
[45:01] come out of my mouth I said brother
[45:02] camis go and help his brother in Akron I
[45:06] said I'll take that from the Lord amen
[45:09] and I received a tremendous amount of
[45:14] growth in the truth from both of these
[45:17] fine men of God even so much as the fact
[45:19] I just left where the Brooks preach off
[45:21] I
[45:24] wouldn't complement praise Lord and
[45:27] appreciate the the ministry and so forth
[45:29] but yet we would you count on a
[45:33] privilege an honor I know times are
[45:35] spent but I sure love everybody in the
[45:37] Lord amen it's great to see all the
[45:38] faces here and I don't know about you I
[45:41] it's time to fully have a revelation
[45:44] where two or three are gathered there am
[45:46] I in the midst he's here right now
[45:50] so that means you don't even have to
[45:52] wait to a man a service to get healing I
[45:55] preached when we first started our
[45:56] service I was preaching and a sister got
[45:58] her foot got healed when a hearing of
[46:01] the word
[46:02] it's time that we realize that that the
[46:07] timing is on the Holy Ghost that the
[46:09] timing is that where you're at with him
[46:11] amen each one of us coming in this room
[46:13] we should come in the expectation God
[46:16] whatever you want to it such as a
[46:18] preacher whatever code you want to come
[46:19] out of my mouth it's your expectation
[46:21] God whatever you have to speak through
[46:23] me let it be an amen let it be a praise
[46:25] of Lord whatever it is let it be why
[46:28] because we're now moving into the
[46:30] corridor where the bride is now being
[46:33] perfectly led of the Holy Ghost amen
[46:35] amen
[46:36] any time to look to the future we're
[46:38] hearing
[46:41] don't think sickness and the rites and
[46:43] all these things are just here to say
[46:45] hey you know you got our 10 years living
[46:47] the Laodicean way no it's time to get
[46:49] right and to serve our God in them
[46:52] so with that being spoke did a lot of
[46:55] wrestling I got a lot a lot of things I
[46:57] could preach on and by God's grace he
[46:59] led me here and I believe this is for
[47:01] someone who believes action just
[47:02] confirmed by that song and by a few
[47:04] other things but
[47:05] let's get into our Bibles if we can Luke
[47:08] 9:23
[47:12] [Music]
[47:16] always gonna sing a breath
[47:20] good see brother John I'm always a
[47:23] blessing England that's a real soldier
[47:25] for God they're here and I've heard that

[48:42] right and follow me for whosoever will

[49:37] humbly we all just come before you right
[49:40] now Lord realizing Lord
[49:43] that we've now taped the order of the
[49:46] battle Lord now even as your prophet
[49:48] spoke God we've sung the songs of Zion
[49:51] and now the ark the word is going forth
[49:53] of God and nor we just oh god we don't
[49:56] desire to hear what would be of a man's
[49:58] thoughts or of a man's words or anything
[50:02] like that but Lord we come here to meet
[50:04] you on these grounds guys we combo God
[50:07] that you would be magnified Lord that
[50:09] you O God would come and touch every
[50:12] single life Oh God and Lord that you
[50:14] would mature this weed oh god as we're
[50:17] sitting here ready Oh God for a body
[50:19] change we're or seated here Oh God Lord
[50:22] we've heard the word Lord we we love you
[50:24] God we've gave up everything for you
[50:26] Lord father mother whatever it is Oh God
[50:28] we've counted the cost of God and we've
[50:32] counted to be worthy Oh God as a
[50:35] sacrifice unto death so we're asking
[50:37] today Lord you'd be with us as we
[50:39] journey in this word lord I pray that
[50:41] there'd be a strength given to the
[50:43] people are and surely Oh God we just ask
[50:46] oh god whatever the need would be in
[50:48] every individual heart that you'd come
[50:49] and move it oh god I as you know Lord
[50:52] we're or just wanting here to be here to
[50:55] be willing and we're glad to be a part
[50:56] of what you've done Lord we prayed aloud
[50:59] to grow leaps and bounds of God we're
[51:01] getting ready Lord so we know a bride's
[51:03] revival is in our midst Oh God so let it
[51:06] be quickened unto us Lord and we just
[51:08] ask Oh God he'd surely speak that whole
[51:11] heart to us in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:12] the church says together and maybe see
[51:15] it
[51:20] I've got a real simple sermon today
[51:22] mistrusted be blasting now we're gonna
[51:25] work with the idea this morning walking
[51:29] in bloody footprints if you're like Lord
[51:33] already told us where to go tonight so I
[51:35] think we're set but by God's grace
[51:37] walking in bloody footprints Amen it's
[51:42] something as we've seen in our scripture
[51:44] there that you know it was Christ who
[51:47] said it to them all he said if any man
[51:51] will come after me let him deny himself
[51:52] and take up his cross daily and follow
[51:56] me so we have heard these things we know
[52:00] these things but surely it's God's
[52:03] desire that we would actually take up
[52:06] this cross and we would follow after him
[52:09] but even noticing in the Old Testament
[52:12] you know by typing shadow you know God
[52:15] always sent the art to go before the
[52:17] battle he then probably the one time
[52:20] that they decided to change the order is
[52:23] actually when they came to spy out the
[52:26] land amen the arcade left them all the
[52:29] way through who told them where to go
[52:31] and it came to the place where it was
[52:34] the men's ideas and say let us take some
[52:37] spies and let's go spy out the land oh
[52:39] my and what did they do when they got
[52:42] ahead of the word then God what he
[52:45] allowed them to bring up an evil report
[52:48] amen and any time that we try to get
[52:52] ahead of the word then God will allow us
[52:55] to up it will allow us to fall and
[52:58] falter amen but isn't it great that
[53:01] there's a mercy that's given to God's
[53:03] people in Ohio we should love God when
[53:06] the scripture rolls in our mind that he
[53:08] delighteth in mercy
[53:12] you may have longed the Lord in your
[53:16] relationship but he said he delights in
[53:18] mercy he delights when you come back to
[53:21] him and say God I need you god I Love
[53:23] You God you're all I need him
[53:26] so we find out that you know Jesus said
[53:31] he said take up the cross and follow me
[53:34] and look at proverbs 20 verse 24 it says
[53:38] here says man's goings are of the Lord
[53:42] how can a man then understand his own
[53:46] way every step that you have taken even
[53:51] up to this point right here you could
[53:55] ever understand your way sometimes
[53:57] you've done wrong things sometimes you
[53:59] realize boy that was a really good
[54:02] decision and then what but when you're
[54:04] really looking dive into the word you
[54:07] actually find out that you know what you
[54:09] didn't even fully understand or grasp
[54:12] that which was around you but it was
[54:14] actually God who had your goings already
[54:18] established for you
[54:21] amen and because our goings are from the
[54:26] Lord proverbs 4 26 says it says ponder
[54:30] the path of thy feet and let all thy
[54:35] ways be establishing it so we should
[54:39] never do anything just just messing
[54:41] around or just say well you know I think
[54:45] I'll do this or I'll do that but we
[54:47] should want we should consider the Lord
[54:50] before us in all our ways amen
[54:53] hallelujah and the scripture says in
[54:55] Jeremiah 10:23 it says O Lord I know
[54:58] that the way of man is not in himself
[55:03] so you think you got it figured out do I
[55:06] gotta figure it out hey we find out more
[55:08] more or that one we ain't found out
[55:11] nothing amen hallelujah hallelujah we
[55:14] let people with these degrees and all
[55:16] these things they tell us everything
[55:17] that's right and wrong and so they move
[55:19] it from global warming to climate change
[55:21] and all these things like that because
[55:23] they don't have a clue in that there's a
[55:26] God who is
[55:28] in my
[55:30] wisdom and they cannot comprehend it
[55:34] because God made this earth for a bride
[55:38] and bride to receive His perfect will
[55:42] and in living his perfect will we find
[55:46] out that we come into the mind of Christ
[55:49] who had known the more that he can
[55:51] instruct him hey men ain't nobody here
[55:53] but the scripture says Paul said believe
[55:56] the mind of Christ amen
[56:00] in any we come again in Jeremiah 10:23
[56:03] it says O Lord I know that the way of
[56:06] man is not in himself
[56:09] see who's gonna get you in a rapture
[56:15] you think it's anything you're gonna do
[56:17] you think it's your legalisms here
[56:20] thickets away you know I have this habit
[56:23] I have this discipline or I have this or
[56:26] that you might be on the exact other
[56:28] side and say I have no discipline hey
[56:30] man what'd you find out what your life
[56:34] was orchestrated from the foundation of
[56:37] the world by God himself
[56:42] to one to direct your steps amen so he
[56:46] says I'm containing it is not a man that
[56:48] walketh to direct his steps
[56:52] that's why I watch
[56:55] pride cometh before a fall hey
[56:59] anytime you
[57:01] find out
[57:11] [Applause]
[57:14] this is everything in it to be led by
[57:18] Christ amen
[57:20] now let's take another step here psalm
[57:22] 37:23 it says the steps of a good man
[57:25] are ordered by the lord amen
[57:31] David could look and say hey
[57:35] because he knew that he minded the Lord
[57:40] so he says what and he delighteth in his
[57:44] way so God is pleased
[57:47] I mean hey if you're the Bride of Christ
[57:49] then tell me is God pleased with you you
[57:53] may fall you may falter but that's why
[57:55] God gave the what he gave the counsel of
[57:58] his word to say that a righteous man
[58:00] falls seven times but he rises again
[58:05] amen
[58:07] we got a trusting God hallelujah who's
[58:11] gonna
[58:13] oh
[58:13] no I gotta get a vaccine what are you
[58:16] worried about
[58:17] what should you worry about hey men
[58:20] should not worry about trying to get up
[58:23] put a mask on for a for a virus
[58:26] supposedly that is what that is smaller
[58:28] then they can even see what it looks
[58:30] like the trollish yeah
[58:33] I'm not trying to go against science and
[58:36] I'm not trying to go on a rant but what
[58:38] I'm telling you is God has every single
[58:42] thing in control
[58:47] so look he says though he fall he shall
[58:52] not be utterly cast down
[58:54] for the lord upholdeth him with his hand
[58:58] oh he's got the whole world in his hands
[59:01] I have been young and now em all
[59:05] yet am I not seeing the righteous
[59:08] forsaken nor his seed begging bread Amen
[59:12] hallelujah there is a God who has
[59:15] everything
[59:17] to make sure that you take the right
[59:21] steps to get in this lecture amen
[59:24] hallelujah now we're going to see some
[59:27] things here now I want you to see this
[59:28] here you're here for these seven now
[59:29] Jesus when he was here on earth he
[59:32] didn't just go about all haphazardly he
[59:37] had one thing to do that was the will of
[59:40] God who sent him and
[59:43] everywhere he went everything he done
[59:46] had a meaning had a purpose had a plan a
[59:51] foreordained plan of God everything he
[59:55] did oh my we said oh yes that's our Lord
[1:00:00] and if we be the children of God
[1:00:07] God who orders our foot Save
[1:00:12] just love your garden and cry out for
[1:00:15] the Holy Ghost crowd for revival just
[1:00:19] like he said blessed are they that
[1:00:20] hunger and thirst for righteousness sake
[1:00:23] as they shall be
[1:00:27] so he says what and
[1:00:29] the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:00:32] ordered of the Lord Jesus never went
[1:00:35] places or did things unless it had a
[1:00:37] meaning many men down through the ages
[1:00:40] has read this same scripture and it has
[1:00:44] inspired men
[1:00:49] at a scripture that says your steps are
[1:00:53] ordered of God
[1:00:56] that means every single step that you
[1:01:00] made today God put it there
[1:01:09] well I just like going to church know
[1:01:11] there is a Spirit of God in you that
[1:01:15] desires our hearing of the word
[1:01:22] don't realize that every single step you
[1:01:25] made brought your right to where he
[1:01:27] wanted you
[1:01:31] we're getting in a place you can't worry
[1:01:34] about being them hey if you think you're
[1:01:35] a foolish virgin get at the altar and
[1:01:37] get right with God and let's believe the
[1:01:39] word amen
[1:01:40] that's the doubt the devil's that see
[1:01:43] the discrepancy he's trying to so
[1:01:45] you say brother came you must be perfect
[1:01:47] ain't perfect at all how do you we'll
[1:01:49] talk my wife glory to God you ain't got
[1:01:51] time to it's a long story man but I'll
[1:01:53] tell you today then that Jesus Christ is
[1:01:57] the same yesterday today and forever in
[1:02:00] it if he is the author of your faith
[1:02:03] that means he is the finisher of your
[1:02:05] faith
[1:02:11] 99 to go get you why would he let you go
[1:02:14] in
[1:02:16] holiness
[1:02:19] so we need for what if we're coming to
[1:02:23] the image of Christ
[1:02:25] then it comes to the place that we have
[1:02:27] to realize that your every step has a
[1:02:30] purpose your every move has a meaning
[1:02:33] and God is what he's trying to unfold
[1:02:36] his perfect will in your life oh my
[1:02:39] let's go again psalm 119 131 I open my
[1:02:44] mouth and panted for I long for thy
[1:02:48] Commandments
[1:02:52] panting Oh for that Commandments tonight
[1:02:57] 130 to look now upon me and be merciful
[1:03:01] unto me as thou usest to do unto those
[1:03:05] that love my name
[1:03:08] Olivia so long God is used to giving
[1:03:11] mercy to them hallelujah who are what
[1:03:14] who are crying out for God they want God
[1:03:17] to be in their life they might not be
[1:03:20] able to pray like they think they should
[1:03:21] or study like they think they should or
[1:03:23] talk like they should they should but
[1:03:26] what they're crying out for mercy o my
[1:03:31] order my steps in thy word and let not
[1:03:35] an iniquity have dominion over me
[1:03:40] iniquity the wrongs that we would allow
[1:03:43] he said don't he said God don't let
[1:03:45] iniquity have a hold in my life
[1:03:49] hallelujah
[1:03:50] so we see that what God is the order of
[1:03:56] your steps I'm going somewhere chess
[1:03:58] alright so I was 8513 it says
[1:04:01] righteousness shall go before him and
[1:04:05] shall set us in the way of his steps
[1:04:10] oh the scripture is all over he's
[1:04:13] walking with you he already told you
[1:04:16] went off he's got everything all right
[1:04:18] where it needs to be and it's what first
[1:04:22] John 2 3 it says and hereby we do know
[1:04:25] that we know him if we keep his
[1:04:27] Commandments
[1:04:29] home he love his work immigrant they met
[1:04:32] this is a revealed Word amen
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:36] hallelujah oh you could be worshipping a
[1:04:38] free persons this morning you could be
[1:04:41] trying to figure out who you should
[1:04:42] worship amen but God revealed to you
[1:04:45] that Jesus Christ is the image of the
[1:04:48] Godhead and he is the image of the
[1:04:51] person that's before you it ain't three
[1:04:53] different it's one and
[1:04:56] so he says he that saith I know him and
[1:04:59] keepeth not his Commandments is a liar
[1:05:00] and the truth is not in him but whoso
[1:05:04] keepeth his word in him verily is the
[1:05:06] love of God perfected hereby we know we
[1:05:10] that we are in him he that saith he
[1:05:13] abideth in him ought himself also so to
[1:05:18] walk even as he walked what a
[1:05:23] commandment what a statement that the
[1:05:27] person who says they want to abide in
[1:05:30] God
[1:05:32] they should walk just like he walked
[1:05:35] well
[1:05:37] wonder how he
[1:05:40] should walk like the word no I want
[1:05:44] to take this a step further and we'll
[1:05:45] take a little turn here mark 10 20 it
[1:05:48] says and he answered now here it is the
[1:05:50] rich young run
[1:05:51] this is a guy that couldn't live closer
[1:05:54] as far as my commandment than most of us
[1:05:57] if not all of us
[1:05:59] he could say not one thing I've kept it
[1:06:04] all for my youth oh oh
[1:06:06] mom anybody want to go with the rich
[1:06:09] overall
[1:06:12] hey brother can take me back that mercy
[1:06:15] scripture of glory to God now in my spot
[1:06:18] amen so he said 20 verse says he
[1:06:22] answered and said unto him master all of
[1:06:24] these have I observed from my youth
[1:06:28] then jesus beholding him loved him and
[1:06:33] said unto him one thing thou
[1:06:37] lettuce
[1:06:38] he brought him to what only one issue
[1:06:42] with us whole life
[1:06:45] one thing
[1:06:46] yeah yeah we yeah
[1:06:51] some of us we need to find healing and
[1:06:53] all in every realm of our life
[1:06:55] come on mm you ever sit there and
[1:06:58] comment
[1:06:59] little haze on you
[1:07:02] still healer though amen absolutely yeah
[1:07:06] so what one thing thou lackest go thy
[1:07:09] way sell whatsoever thou hast and give
[1:07:13] to the poor and thou shalt have treasure
[1:07:15] in heaven and come take up the cross and
[1:07:19] follow me amen and he was sad at that
[1:07:23] saying and when we agreed for he had
[1:07:26] great possessions and Jesus looked round
[1:07:29] about and saith unto his disciples how
[1:07:31] hardly shall they they have riches enter
[1:07:34] into the kingdom of God in and he
[1:07:37] brought the rich young ruler down to one
[1:07:39] thing that's all you gotta do but notice
[1:07:42] how he words it all along he said this
[1:07:45] is what you lack go sell at all but then
[1:07:47] he says he says what take up the cross
[1:07:51] and follow me
[1:07:54] you ever notice how Christ never says
[1:07:57] get ahead of me
[1:08:00] lead me
[1:08:02] Christ never tells you to lead him
[1:08:07] because he's the shepherd
[1:08:10] he's gone
[1:08:12] the whole worm is we've just we went
[1:08:14] through very quickly but you found there
[1:08:16] was God that set everything up so that
[1:08:19] you would follow him
[1:08:22] even this this portion of scripture that
[1:08:26] we see open right up to us is the fact
[1:08:29] that even now coming to the rapture
[1:08:33] the argument is the same that what there
[1:08:37] are the reaches of life that are trying
[1:08:40] to weigh us down they're trying to take
[1:08:43] over our life
[1:08:45] and what there is a still small voice
[1:08:48] that is still speaking and saying take
[1:08:51] up your cross and follow me amen now
[1:08:56] isn't a
[1:08:58] great foreshadowing by the master this
[1:09:01] master patek when you could actually
[1:09:03] watch by prefigure speak of the cross
[1:09:06] that he was going to
[1:09:08] take up the cross follow me
[1:09:11] so notice he wants us to what he told
[1:09:15] the rich of rock take up the cross he
[1:09:18] got the cross richard rules by sinners
[1:09:20] and what is he talking about
[1:09:23] cuz Christ had not had a cross yet in
[1:09:28] the natural
[1:09:31] so
[1:09:33] we find the next step moon there of
[1:09:37] course you walked away he just didn't
[1:09:38] want to take up the cross and follow God
[1:09:40] in Matthew 27 27 it says then the
[1:09:44] soldiers of the governor took Jesus into
[1:09:48] the common Hall and gathered unto Him
[1:09:51] the whole band of soldiers now this is
[1:09:53] intimate stuff brother-sister this is
[1:09:55] the husband amen this is what he did for
[1:09:59] his church this is what he did for
[1:10:02] creation no ma and it says and they
[1:10:05] stripped him and put on him a starlit
[1:10:08] Road to mock his royalty and when they
[1:10:10] had planted a crown of thorns they put
[1:10:13] it upon his head and a reed in his right
[1:10:15] hand and they bowed the knee before him
[1:10:18] and mocked him saying hail King of the
[1:10:21] Jews
[1:10:22] oho those men who had now made the
[1:10:25] decision and went on to the afterlife or
[1:10:27] what's left of it oh how they must
[1:10:30] wonder why did I do it oh my
[1:10:33] what they did
[1:10:39] they made a mockery of
[1:10:42] Christ's sacrifice Oh may we never make
[1:10:46] and
[1:10:48] they spit upon him trip the reed smote
[1:10:52] him on the head and after they had
[1:10:55] mocked him they took the robe off of him
[1:10:57] and put his own raiment on him and led
[1:11:00] him away to crucify him all right so now
[1:11:04] they're getting ready to what bring the
[1:11:07] crucifixion hallelujah a Eastern Easter
[1:11:12] doesn't get old brother sister
[1:11:15] we die daily look at what he did
[1:11:18] here he is take all those beatings all
[1:11:21] those scores all those bruisings a
[1:11:25] notice isaiah 52:13
[1:11:27] he says behold my servant shall deal
[1:11:31] prudently
[1:11:32] he shall be exalted and extolled and be
[1:11:36] very high as many were astonished at
[1:11:40] thee his message was so marred than any
[1:11:44] man and his form more than the sons of
[1:11:47] men so shall he sprinkle many nations
[1:11:50] the Kings shall shut their mouths ahem
[1:11:53] for that which had not been told them
[1:11:55] shall they see and that which they had
[1:11:58] not heard shall they consider Omaha
[1:12:01] hallelujah oh he was so beaten so raised
[1:12:04] because he was not just taking just one
[1:12:07] man sin even though he would have done
[1:12:09] it he was dying for the whole sin of the
[1:12:13] world and he was so bruised that you
[1:12:16] couldn't even tell
[1:12:17] whether that was man or what was that
[1:12:20] just nothing but blood
[1:12:26] he did that for each
[1:12:34] Matthew 27 32 continuing
[1:12:38] says and as they came out
[1:12:41] they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name
[1:12:45] him they compelled to bear his cross
[1:12:50] once again Luke 23 26 and as they led
[1:12:54] him away they laid hold upon one Simon a
[1:12:57] Cyrenian coming out of the country and
[1:13:00] on him they laid the cross notice that
[1:13:03] he might bear it after Jesus
[1:13:08] hallelujah
[1:13:09] so Jesus so marred so beaten so Bream's
[1:13:14] that as we seen in that picture most
[1:13:17] likely there it is without the blood but
[1:13:19] in the cross there
[1:13:21] on him as he's on the ground he could
[1:13:24] not bear the weight
[1:13:26] he decided what he couldn't do it they
[1:13:32] went as far as he could God had to
[1:13:36] anoint someone
[1:13:38] to help bears across with him
[1:13:43] hallelujah there he was so think about
[1:13:47] it
[1:13:50] God in his Eternal Word sets forth and
[1:13:55] even the picture of his crucifixion
[1:13:57] he lays down every foundation take up
[1:14:01] your cross and follow me take up the
[1:14:03] cross follow me and now we see in the
[1:14:07] scripture that even as he's going to the
[1:14:10] cross he can no longer bear the weight
[1:14:14] of the cross so now he with all his
[1:14:18] might now spent he falls and now there's
[1:14:22] a man named Simon of Cyrene and
[1:14:25] now they compel him now they jump on him
[1:14:29] and they say carry his cross amen so
[1:14:32] notice Christ now walking before the
[1:14:36] cross struggling maybe crawling whatever
[1:14:39] it is the life that he has left and then
[1:14:42] Simon the Cyrenian takes the cross and
[1:14:45] their Christ your savior is crawling
[1:14:48] maybe trying to get up with a crown of
[1:14:50] thorns bleeding marred all over the
[1:14:53] ground
[1:14:54] and there Simon is compelled he has to
[1:14:58] pick up the cross and he's just got to
[1:15:00] sit there and follow with his cross
[1:15:02] bearing his cross
[1:15:09] Gill says he says that he might bear it
[1:15:12] after Jesus either the whole of it
[1:15:15] following Jesus or one end of it Jesus
[1:15:17] going before with the other end on his
[1:15:19] shoulder which seems to be the order in
[1:15:22] which it was carried between them so now
[1:15:24] we see that Christ and
[1:15:28] Simon serene but now carrying this cross
[1:15:32] which we don't have the full eye I
[1:15:34] prefer to say there it is anyway you see
[1:15:37] it Christ was right in front yes
[1:15:41] now notice
[1:15:43] leaving I'm able to do this 19:50 so
[1:15:47] here's the way I was praying I'll never
[1:15:49] forget the way I pray I said Heavenly
[1:15:53] Father some 1,900 years ago there was an
[1:15:57] old rugged cross
[1:15:59] dragging down through the streets of
[1:16:01] Jerusalem it was dragging out the bloody
[1:16:05] footprints of the bear
[1:16:08] on the road up to Golgotha his little
[1:16:13] weak frail body fell under the law along
[1:16:17] things
[1:16:18] Simon the Cyrene a colored man ethiopian
[1:16:22] picked up the cross and helped him bear
[1:16:25] the cross said father I'm sure you
[1:16:28] understand and here's one of his
[1:16:30] daughters tonight staggering in darkness
[1:16:33] won't you help her now if I finish this
[1:16:37] quote he said sister the Lord healed you
[1:16:40] go on you're all right and numerous
[1:16:42] times even your prophet when we've been
[1:16:45] talking about this situation he would
[1:16:48] saying there was Simon the Cyrene no no
[1:16:50] many people will get caught up and
[1:16:52] they'll say and this all I'm so glad we
[1:16:54] got a seventh angel amen and they'll say
[1:16:56] it was a Jew
[1:16:58] it was of the Jewish sect of sorry
[1:17:01] but every time your prophet picked up he
[1:17:05] said it was this colored Ethiopian
[1:17:08] Hawaiian how he must have went through
[1:17:10] the dimensions seen the picture a lot
[1:17:13] man hallelujah but notice
[1:17:16] if this isn't a Jew then it's a Gentile
[1:17:22] god-ordained a Gentile to share the load
[1:17:27] of the cross
[1:17:32] and numerous times as your prophet he's
[1:17:36] in prayer lines and so lord he'll talk
[1:17:38] about this he said he said yes and it
[1:17:40] was your dad's great granddaddy back
[1:17:42] there and he said all bones for the
[1:17:44] helium
[1:17:48] some weight that it was a Gentile Amen
[1:17:51] hallelujah because those traitors were
[1:17:54] inserting
[1:17:59] someone to share the load he chose a
[1:18:02] Gentile amen
[1:18:06] and picked up the cross and they
[1:18:09] struggled right up
[1:18:17] bloody footprints of the bear
[1:18:24] he was dwindled down to
[1:18:26] nothing but bloody footprints
[1:18:34] every step
[1:18:36] had a purpose
[1:18:40] he was driven
[1:18:44] how could he not go to Calvary his whole
[1:18:47] life he had done all of it just for this
[1:18:50] one God
[1:18:53] Hebrews 13:12 wherefore jesus also that
[1:18:56] he might sanctify the people with his
[1:18:58] own blood suffered without the gate
[1:19:02] let us go forth therefore unto him
[1:19:07] without the camp bearing his reproach
[1:19:11] this reproach as ashamed as a burden if
[1:19:16] one would follow Christ just like Simon
[1:19:19] the Cyrene he had a lot he had to take
[1:19:22] part in the reproach of a crucifixion
[1:19:27] hallelujah but he didn't realize the
[1:19:29] whole time that he was carrying that
[1:19:32] cross he was tearing cross of his sage
[1:19:37] I love it how Spurgeon Rose we talked
[1:19:40] about this and he said he said oh how
[1:19:42] might we envy this Simon the Cyrene
[1:19:47] with the very honor and privilege to
[1:19:51] carry the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:19:53] he said but we need not envy
[1:19:57] he said because there's a cross for each
[1:20:00] one of us to perón a
[1:20:06] new young notice
[1:20:09] no matter
[1:20:12] how it went with Christ up that hill
[1:20:17] Simon
[1:20:18] he didn't look off and see the other
[1:20:21] path and say I'm gonna go this way
[1:20:26] the Prophet the scripture says he
[1:20:28] followed him straight
[1:20:34] you say who are you actually following
[1:20:38] who's actually the leading your
[1:20:40] footsteps
[1:20:42] see this
[1:20:46] Matthew 16:24 let's set Jesus on his
[1:20:50] disciples If any man will come after me
[1:20:52] let him deny himself take up his cross
[1:20:55] and follow me for whosoever will lose
[1:20:58] his life or save his life shall lose it
[1:21:01] and whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:21:04] sake shall find it for what is a man
[1:21:06] profited if he shall gain the whole
[1:21:08] world but what shall a man give in
[1:21:11] exchange for a soul for the son of man
[1:21:13] shall come in the glory of his father
[1:21:15] with his angels and then he shall reward
[1:21:18] every man according to his words
[1:21:23] deny yourself you don't think Simon had
[1:21:27] those thoughts
[1:21:32] but he just
[1:21:34] the anointed path and he was talking he
[1:21:39] could have revolted because anything he
[1:21:42] just what he denied his own will and
[1:21:45] perfectly
[1:21:46] across the counter
[1:21:51] first Peter 2:20 says for what glory is
[1:21:55] it when you be buffeted for your faults
[1:21:58] you shall take it patiently all right
[1:22:02] are you getting trouble for your faults
[1:22:05] what is it if you take a piece of me you
[1:22:08] didn't wrong
[1:22:10] but if when you do well and suffer for
[1:22:14] it you take it patiently this is
[1:22:16] acceptable with God hmm
[1:22:20] for even hereunto were ye called because
[1:22:24] Christ also suffered for us leaving
[1:22:26] us an example that ye should follow his
[1:22:31] steps
[1:22:34] all right
[1:22:35] same pathway
[1:22:38] if you have his spirit you will do the
[1:22:42] same thing
[1:22:43] it might be unique in its design but
[1:22:46] it's always coming down to what will you
[1:22:50] give up to serve the Lord which is why
[1:22:52] right now in time is so important
[1:22:56] because we don't have all that's right
[1:23:00] it's time to go yeah
[1:23:05] got time to set up the mansion it's time
[1:23:08] to go see Jesus amen who
[1:23:12] who did no sin neither was guile deceit
[1:23:16] hurt rickety trickery found in his mouth
[1:23:18] who when he was reviled reviled not
[1:23:20] again when he suffered he threatened not
[1:23:22] but committed himself to him that
[1:23:25] judgeth righteously
[1:23:28] what can we take the final Christ we can
[1:23:31] take whatever the cost is
[1:23:34] in the son u- scripture says ask for
[1:23:38] gold tried in the fire in him
[1:23:44] we've got to walk in his statutes his
[1:23:47] steps isn't Leodis here
[1:23:51] his steps there's what
[1:23:54] there's a perfect precise plan that he
[1:23:57] has for each one of us
[1:23:58] half the time we look at our inabilities
[1:24:01] or say I can't think right I can't talk
[1:24:02] right I can't do this right you can't do
[1:24:05] any of that right that's why he wants to
[1:24:08] be in yo
[1:24:15] his own self bare our sins in his own
[1:24:18] body on the tree that we being dead to
[1:24:21] sins should live unto righteousness
[1:24:22] rights ye were he told him in
[1:24:27] his stripes healed you two thousand
[1:24:31] years ago he can't do it again it's done
[1:24:36] it don't matter how crazy or your father
[1:24:39] says it doesn't matter how bad you feel
[1:24:41] like when they're done
[1:24:44] we had a cat
[1:24:46] with hey God healed two cats in the last
[1:24:49] six months for whatever reason brother
[1:24:51] Brooks I don't know
[1:24:54] but the one cat came off but one time
[1:24:57] he's kind of a he's kind of a straight
[1:24:59] time cat now I just got does his thing
[1:25:00] gonna come over your food every now and
[1:25:02] then right all right what cause no he's
[1:25:04] all beaten and he look like a dog I'll
[1:25:06] hold on mouth there's or something
[1:25:08] just destroyed his mouth and then he
[1:25:10] just looked horrible
[1:25:11] she said what should we do I said well
[1:25:13] let's let's put him in the mudroom a
[1:25:14] little trying to nurse him back to
[1:25:16] health all right so we put him in there
[1:25:18] and you know anyway we started we start
[1:25:22] nursing them up well baby's like hey
[1:25:23] that's all right looks all right and I
[1:25:25] was out working in the garage they come
[1:25:26] back in the house I
[1:25:28] seen that cat laying there just kind of
[1:25:30] kind of this mangy bad bad looking
[1:25:32] creature
[1:25:34] some of that's our normal opinion
[1:25:36] perhaps but that cat I walk through and
[1:25:39] I seen that cat laying there and son
[1:25:41] just moved my heart I said you want I'm
[1:25:44] gonna pray again for this cat so when I
[1:25:46] laid my hands on I said Lord Lord I know
[1:25:48] you have a will for this cat so there's
[1:25:51] no reason why you brought it back so
[1:25:53] lord you must have a desire to do
[1:25:56] something for this cat I said I I mean I
[1:25:59] said Lord it looks like that but I know
[1:26:01] you're a healer
[1:26:05] I prayed on the cat I said that's in the
[1:26:07] name of Jesus Christ Lord by the blood I
[1:26:12] pray in
[1:26:45] [Laughter]
[1:26:54] it's go
[1:27:04] God is pray for this thing I say God I
[1:27:07] pray for the snake
[1:27:12] so of course like a normal cat would do
[1:27:15] to further the suffering to the
[1:27:16] individual it rain to our porch and
[1:27:18] start bleeding all over a bush
[1:27:22] so I said God I prayed for that I don't
[1:27:28] know I
[1:27:30] don't know what's going on here
[1:27:33] but Lord it's in your hands
[1:27:38] so within like 10 minutes of course kids
[1:27:41] ain't gonna sit there bet it when he
[1:27:44] left on the porch come out right away
[1:27:49] it's a great I don't know should I pray
[1:27:52] for it
[1:27:53] and so two days went by like well maybe
[1:27:57] kids will find it out in the yard I
[1:27:58] don't know what's going on sure enough
[1:28:00] that cat comes walking back up to the
[1:28:03] house when I was at work it's completely
[1:28:06] better
[1:28:13] said God you were testing me
[1:28:16] by how will I know if I will be done
[1:28:21] but his stripes are so
[1:28:26] I'm so amazing
[1:28:28] that bloodshed promise of God
[1:28:32] it might not look like it'll work but
[1:28:35] stay right there
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:39] cuz just the way it is we pray for
[1:28:41] something like oh go to God that cats
[1:28:43] gonna climb up a wall and do backflips
[1:28:44] of the obedient yeah it ain't gonna
[1:28:46] happen amen
[1:28:58] and what God in this season he will
[1:29:02] break the plan I had to hold on cuz I
[1:29:05] couldn't damage I had to hold on I
[1:29:08] prayed for we got to believe that we're
[1:29:11] anointed remember remember how your
[1:29:13] prophet talked about Moses he said let
[1:29:15] there be flash he said that was the
[1:29:17] actual thought of God
[1:29:26] lower to God
[1:29:29] don't put Moses on a pedestal your child
[1:29:33] of God he'll move through you amen
[1:29:38] but what that
[1:29:40] blood was shed
[1:29:42] and it provided what
[1:29:47] provided a cross that you could follow
[1:29:50] after
[1:29:52] that's right let's get to this
[1:29:56] present stage of my ministry one of our
[1:29:58] deacons here I don't know whether he's
[1:30:00] here tonight or not it's Tony's Abel

[1:31:04] a pair of overalls on wearing a little
[1:31:06] cowboy hat this is a drink
[1:31:09] someone sat down in Kentucky said
[1:31:12] talking about me down here they said
[1:31:14] that guy looks anything like but a
[1:31:16] preacher
[1:31:17] might look like a farmer or something
[1:31:20] but you know it looks
[1:31:22] it ain't looks today brother sister it
[1:31:25] no matter how you look at a you know
[1:31:27] sort of matters what you're looking at
[1:31:29] that is what you're following a bit and
[1:31:34] said that it was me standing up and he
[1:31:37] climbed up till he got to me and said I
[1:31:40] got him by the arm and led him on up
[1:31:44] till I got top the hill and there's a
[1:31:47] wilderness to go through and I said Tony
[1:31:50] I must leave you here and you must walk

[1:32:13] said that's what I followed all the way
[1:32:18] just stay on that
[1:32:21] that's the only thing I know to point to
[1:32:25] not to a creed or sensation of some sort
[1:32:29] but to those bloody footprints that
[1:32:31] leads to the Bible the blood of Jesus
[1:32:35] Christ amen
[1:32:40] comes all the way down
[1:32:41] to the seven churches now remember these
[1:32:44] messages are given
[1:32:47] they're inspired of God with a what a
[1:32:50] message pointing us to a storehouse for
[1:32:53] food for us to eat amen and God gives
[1:32:56] his deacon this dream hallelujah where
[1:32:59] he's going and trying to find the way to
[1:33:01] heaven amen
[1:33:03] he asks this pastor tells him ask that
[1:33:06] bastard a pointer what to the top of the
[1:33:08] mount I love it that's all the time when

[1:33:30] but I got you
[1:33:31] you don't love about this
[1:33:34] cuz even in the dream the Prophet says
[1:33:38] he says I can't go any farther from this
[1:33:42] it was not God's will to go any farther
[1:33:47] with the Prophet you
[1:33:49] understand what I'm saying understand
[1:33:52] hey we ain't kicking on best as we're
[1:33:54] doing like that when I called him up
[1:33:55] I'll call him a failure call him a false
[1:33:57] prophet it is a true vindicated message
[1:34:00] he
[1:34:02] looked at the point would say oh this
[1:34:06] prophet was so gifted he was so amazing
[1:34:09] so mighty but the only thing that that
[1:34:13] prophet did was take up a cross
[1:34:30] brothers Abel's bring realize he was
[1:34:34] walking by the same stance at the
[1:34:36] prophet
[1:34:39] prophet follow the bloody footprints of
[1:34:42] Christ off the bomb
[1:34:47] deikun takes the same
[1:34:50] not even realizing it and what follows
[1:34:53] those same prints up the
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:34:59] mountain Luna where you seeing the
[1:35:03] picture oh my don't you love that number
[1:35:06] how many times no prophet wanted to go
[1:35:08] off the sea
[1:35:09] they were
[1:35:22] husband he couldn't be a father
[1:35:25] he was a
[1:35:32] woman
[1:35:35] you tell your life
[1:35:38] we would not have
[1:35:45] made the sacrifice
[1:35:51] [Applause]
[1:35:53] do you and what promise said that
[1:35:57] settled it right there
[1:36:00] do you sell it for the pie
[1:36:05] will be done but thine be
[1:36:09] every steps orchestrated you think about
[1:36:13] how many times we try to get in the mind
[1:36:14] of God as far as we get inspired by our
[1:36:17] own fleshly lust our own fleshly
[1:36:19] thoughts and what
[1:36:22] we got to be careful
[1:36:24] because this is a path it's a very
[1:36:27] narrow path
[1:36:29] but I tell you brother sister you are
[1:36:31] not walking a path that has not been
[1:36:33] walked before
[1:36:34] by the scripture
[1:36:37] by the message of the hour you're only
[1:36:41] walking the same path that leads to
[1:36:44] Christ amen
[1:36:47] hallelujah
[1:36:50] so notice this
[1:36:52] so then it was God's will his intention
[1:36:56] Hey
[1:36:58] then watch in this dream he
[1:37:01] says okay let's go up the mountain and
[1:37:05] brother branham said I can't I'm not
[1:37:06] going for further than this
[1:37:11] isn't it amazing all these years at this
[1:37:14] message and look at what a mess it's in
[1:37:17] the path is simple follow Christ
[1:37:22] yes hallelujah it don't matter
[1:37:27] how much money you have how much money
[1:37:29] you don't have it doesn't matter how
[1:37:31] many buddies you've gotten how many
[1:37:33] buddies you don't got it doesn't matter
[1:37:35] if you're the preacher or the person
[1:37:36] sitting there not in those in the seats
[1:37:38] it does not matter and then hallelujah
[1:37:41] what matters is you realize that what
[1:37:43] that Christ is first love in your life
[1:37:46] and you're willing to do anything he
[1:37:49] tells you to do
[1:37:51] because brother's able is no different
[1:37:54] from each one of us amen
[1:37:57] hey you can listen you can listen to all
[1:38:01] these tapes and so forth and that is
[1:38:02] part of the building by the sister but
[1:38:04] there must be an area that you have with
[1:38:07] Christ himself
[1:38:09] hallelujah Christ is yes the anointing
[1:38:12] is on the messages amen but there was an
[1:38:14] anointing that is inside of you
[1:38:17] hallelujah that annoys they will speak
[1:38:20] just as loud later
[1:38:22] why because he has a determined will
[1:38:25] that he wants you to live out he has
[1:38:27] testimonies he wants you to live out him
[1:38:34] so he says how am I gonna make it
[1:38:38] he says see those bloody footprints I
[1:38:41] followed those two right here
[1:38:44] you follow those those will lead you
[1:38:47] through
[1:38:48] now notice this cuz then he said it's
[1:38:52] not a cream or a sensation
[1:38:54] you can't point to any of that
[1:38:57] notice I love this because you see
[1:39:00] Christ he is the water
[1:39:05] thou shalt not surely not it is thou
[1:39:08] shall surely die it might be so closer
[1:39:11] to see the Elector the possible but the
[1:39:14] bride cannot be to see
[1:39:20] what's gonna lead you through oh
[1:39:25] I hope you can look and say yeah I've
[1:39:29] been following some bloody footprints
[1:39:31] yeah oh there's a prophet their glory to
[1:39:33] God I've been following that prophet
[1:39:34] with that message all the way here
[1:39:38] my notice the wrestles bloody footprints
[1:39:43] they were leading to the Bible
[1:39:47] they were pointing to the revelation it
[1:39:51] would see you through amen
[1:39:55] on an intellectual ism yes stay with the
[1:39:59] simple one
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:10] Gleason's 524 hold on and they that are
[1:40:14] Christ's have crucified the flesh with
[1:40:16] the affections and lust all right so no
[1:40:20] now notice the whole picture you see in
[1:40:22] the word this is constant
[1:40:24] it runs right through it I love it
[1:40:27] because see there ain't no man that
[1:40:30] could put this together God put a
[1:40:32] perfect book for his bride
[1:40:35] that's why it all ties in so perfect
[1:40:37] what they've crucified the flesh with
[1:40:40] the affections in us if we live in the
[1:40:42] spirit let us also walk in the spirit
[1:40:48] let's come back it's not the natural
[1:40:51] chemistry of
[1:41:01] if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:41:04] walk
[1:41:06] in this
[1:41:09] Galatians 5:16 this I say then walk in
[1:41:12] the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the
[1:41:16] lust of
[1:41:17] see he never changed the idea that you
[1:41:20] walk with him you walk in his pack you
[1:41:23] follow after him
[1:41:25] sons of God are led by the Spirit of God
[1:41:28] oh

[1:46:55] looking at mail like
[1:46:57] what's this
[1:47:00] that's a letter from that painting
[1:47:02] contractor
[1:47:04] so my oh yeah my wait so I get in the
[1:47:07] house open that's when I
[1:47:09] thought my right
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:14] so I get in the house and he said I said
[1:47:18] I've had a lot of yellow letter he said
[1:47:20] I she said said hi he said I've had a
[1:47:24] lot of convictions in my prayers lately
[1:47:26] and this came to my mind
[1:47:30] he said I'm going to make this right
[1:47:33] he said I'm sorry for all the trouble I
[1:47:35] caused you and he left me a big check in
[1:47:39] the mail
[1:47:42] and I got done with all that I said
[1:47:47] the first thought came up with me is
[1:47:49] when brother branham was thinking about
[1:47:51] those deers and three deers come walking
[1:47:53] up to him take him boy yeah
[1:47:58] but he stood by his word and God said
[1:48:01] well stand by my word
[1:48:05] and I I didn't care I left it go
[1:48:09] but I just stood by my word
[1:48:13] the devil is right there to tempt you on
[1:48:17] every step coz whether you believe it or
[1:48:19] not I know sometimes you say boy I don't
[1:48:22] want to make that commitment
[1:48:24] but sometimes that's that sweet boy's
[1:48:27] voice working on him you know
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:35] what Prince we'll be walking this
[1:48:37] morning
[1:48:40] but God is a miracle worker job he's a
[1:48:44] great cop
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:49:01] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:49:04] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[1:49:06] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:49:09] after the spirit everything after after
[1:49:14] what Prince are you walking it I'm
[1:49:16] walking in bloody footprints
[1:49:19] you think that's the easiest thing to do
[1:49:22] you're walking in this reproach
[1:49:27] and you're showing that what that was
[1:49:30] his sacrifice but you were making your
[1:49:32] sacrifice to walk the same way
[1:49:34] so he says
[1:49:36] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:49:38] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[1:49:41] law of sin and death for what the law
[1:49:43] could not do it is in that it was weak
[1:49:45] through the flesh God sending his own
[1:49:46] son in the likeness of a sinful flesh
[1:49:48] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[1:49:50] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:49:52] be fulfilled in us
[1:49:55] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:49:59] the spirit
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:04] one more
[1:50:06] great mighty Conqueror man was refused
[1:50:09] from heaven the highways was closed
[1:50:10] there's no highways but where there was
[1:50:13] no highways he come to make one
[1:50:16] home on the first line was demons of
[1:50:19] doubt the
[1:50:21] next was prejudice the next was
[1:50:23] selfishness the earth was covered over
[1:50:26] with lines of demon power
[1:50:30] then sickness diseases but when he began
[1:50:33] to ascend up to heaven last night we had
[1:50:35] him coming out of hell with the keys of
[1:50:37] death and hell on his side this morning
[1:50:39] we're taking him up hallelujah when he
[1:50:41] rose he he was triumph and as he went up
[1:50:44] he broke every devil power that bolts
[1:50:47] over man he ascended on high gave gifts
[1:50:50] to man the gift of the holy spirit the
[1:50:53] mighty Conqueror he stands alone this
[1:50:55] morning and between him and every
[1:50:58] believer is the blessed old highway of
[1:51:01] holiness that the righteous shall walk
[1:51:03] on there's not a way of escape amen

[1:51:11] escape
[1:51:12] what you lad in the preview the crowd
[1:51:15] they started to get out of lining
[1:51:22] so
[1:51:24] there's only one line cut down from
[1:51:26] glory he left the bloody footprints as
[1:51:30] he walked through the quarters of demon
[1:51:33] powers whoo and made a highway for us
[1:51:37] all the way through he sets on high this
[1:51:39] morning as the mighty Conqueror
