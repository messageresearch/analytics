[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like to just return now to the book of Revelation I could do some teaching on this it's one of the Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 I'm sorry about that but kind of hot in here darling yes did you open the window that'd be ok thank you sweetie I apologize if anyone else is kind of cold but I'm kind of hot Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 so we're looking at chapters 10 and 11 I think a couple weeks ago we looked at revelation 8 and 9 on a Wednesday night so we're working our way through the book of Revelation and this is important for all of us you know when I go back and start studying these things again helpful things that I learn and remember then I know it's good for the young ones to praise God I know our little ones are starting to get older now and they can start understanding it and understand why we believe what we believe by the grace of the Lord so Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 let's read verse 1 together if we can ready 1 2 3 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire amen let's bow our heads for a word prayer one more time if ever need on your heart just making on into God Heavenly Father we love you Lord God we thank you again for this gathering Lord as we heard this morning father may the waves of faith Lord the warm waves of faith Lord start moving here in our midst Lord God and Lord as we look at Revelation 10 Lord we know that that's you Lord you came down to earth dear God and father I just asked God by your grace and mercy Lord and that sweet presence Lord would be with us God your presence dear God in your presence is where we're strong Lord and we prayed and sang earlier that you would draw us into your presence so Lord in your presence is fullness of joy and life and all that we have need of is in your presence so Lord let us feel that tonight father god revive us again Lord strengthen us again and if is again build us up Lord God into the stature of a real Christian so father speak to us through this thy word in Jesus Christ's name in every said Amen god bless yous being seated praise guy well there's one great thing I left out this morning brother hoses they brought to my attention afterwards the emancipate my head sebacean proclamation was in 1863 and the seals were opened exactly a hundred years later in 1963 so I got to add that to that graphic I got to update that graphic I'm gonna make my own graphic that's right to do because that one's run out of room so again a hundred years after Abraham set all the captives Abraham Lincoln said all the captives free God comes and breaks all the seals in 1960 300 years later and that sets all of us free because it's quickening power with the opening of the word so thank you brother I'd heard that before I just forgot it so I'm sorry but thank you I appreciate that that's not like Jose he's got all this if all those revelations like fresh on his heart in mind the Holy Spirit brings it down to him so we're very grateful for that okay revelation 10 yesterday I spent all those hours and I just got that one sermon from this morning I was kind of laboring in the message but it finally came together so I don't have any more on that right now I got a study on purpose again this week but so I have to by just by necessity I got to start going back to the revelation here so hope that's okay we'll go back to Revelation 10 and if it's okay liddie you can switch over here I'm just gonna play the video because I put all the scripture references on the video on YouTube and then I just downloaded it and then I'll go through the scriptures and maybe Lydia Malachi if you can have the Bible's ready to read forced but I'd be ok we have some Bibles in case you maybe you have a Bible to read you okay you don't want to read okay I don't have a Bible okay all right so let's look at that here we'll go Polly get through chapter 10 and chapter 11 yes server thank you thank you so for most of us a lot of these are review but I know there's some scriptures in there I've never heard preached before and they they go really well with this topic so you know revelation is a little bit of a just a little bit revelation is a great mystery to most people to us you know we actually have some chapters that are completely thus saith the Lord to us in the in the seventh seal brother Branham said that search ages plus the seals he said they're all thus saith the Lord so we have revelation one two three and at least six we have at least four chapters that are absolutely thus saith the Lord so we're grateful for that now other people you know they a lot of people just guess and things like that we even have other the state the Lord's Revelation 13 brother Ram gave us a bus say at the Lord for the mark of the beast so we know exactly the state the Lord what the mark of the beast is he said it's unionized religion right confederation of religion he says so we have so many thus say the Lord's in here that what we do is what I do is I start with all of us say at the Lord's and if you have all those symbols and all the scriptures write together then that helps you interpret the rest of it and so that's what I want to do tonight we want to use all the revelations that we've heard and put them all together and actually let me pull this quote I just was looking at yesterday I've forgotten about it you know we're doing today what brother Branham wished he could have did okay so this is a 1961 program said he's preaching the revelation series how are all you enjoying the revelation all right I believe a whole lot like my little girl Sara back there said it's become revolutions to me it's just revolutions going over and over you know I wish we just had a now so that's January 1st of 1961 well Graham said I wish we had now until March or April January February March April so three or four months in a row he wanted to do this and just put a great big canvas across the back here back of the pulpit and just come down in the daytime and draw all those pictures and the whole chart and just raise them up and down like window shades you know like I've always dreamed sometime of having a great big tabernacle somewhere where I could reach just could reach down and pull this chart down come all the way across the platform and revelations and the interpretations the Lord has given me and take a pointer and start through there and bring these ages down then when we get there I'm sorry then we get through this raise that one up pull the other one down like this and start on that and teach it through oh that would just be like a little heaven wouldn't it just set the complete winter through just sit it out with the Lord don't you like that oh that's what we get to do now you know when we pull up our our little slides like this you know we put slides up and and the other ones let me go to the other ones recently teaching on these orders of you know things like this about the this the spiritual year of Israel you know all these times that we can pull up our timelines and everything where's another other dimensions you have the dimensions of seven dimensions where's a good timeline well you got all the timelines you got the four the four transitions of the twelve tribes of Israel how they trans are they transfer like that you've got Mount Zion showdown my my temple mount mount a temple rock I thought I had more time lines in there well I must have timelines and the other ones but you understand what I'm talking about yeah here we go brother Brandon thought it would be a great little heaven yeah things like this like Daniels 70 weeks you can put it out all down through there and how the church ages comes in between the middle of that 70th week so I think we understand right you understand brother Brandon wish he had the time to do that but he wasn't called to do that he wasn't called to be a pastor anymore he was called to be a prophet and the angel said do the work of evangelist so I'm very happy now that we have a chance to do some of these things that the Prophet never got to do because of his calling and his commission so we're now on chapter 10 this is part 88 of the series and we'll just look at a few things now I I believe this this quote here tells us also that revelation 10 is the say at the Lord - I now might be open to a little bit of interpretation but brother BAM says in trying to do God a service the Bible Malachi 4 said what would happen today revelation 10 how the seals would be open and reveal all these mysteries that's been hid through these reformers he said how it would be done it's in the Bible thus saith the Lord God has completely perfectly identified that and vindicated to be truth by signs wonders in the heavens and the skies and everything else or 33 years all right so see how I think it's sometimes it's important to see that it seems like miligrams saying revelation 10 is also thus saith Lord because it's in the Bible and he says come to pass now this is the quote brother Jose and I'd look for a couple times and found it on what is the attraction of the mountain brother Ram said what happened on Mount sunset God confirming his word that's where all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promise word again of revelation 10 one two seven and the days of the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of God should be finished they hid a mystery of Revelation ten one two seven the last message to the last church age fulfills exactly in this age st. Luke seventeen thirty the day when the Son of man shall be revealed now brother man then tells the story of seeing the vision of the seven angels and then he says the God of heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery of his vision was a prophecy what time is it sir he said but now it's history it's past okay and he says it's past the promises fulfilled what time is it sir what's the attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever now you got to really keep your balance in the book of Revelation don't you because there's so much is that's not and this is not in the right order right it's not chronologically in the right order for example we just got done preaching revelation 7 8 and 9 and most of 7 8 and 9 is in the Tribulation Period right and the 60 on the fifth and sixth see are actually in the Tribulation Period as well so it's interesting in chapter 6 you have the 6 seals the lasts the fifth and sixth one are in the tribulation then you jump to chapter 7 which is the 144,000 and I believe the bride could be the foolish version though and the bride that picks it up the tribulation chapter 8 and 9 is definitely tribulation and now you get to chapter 10 and we got a fast-forward back into the church ages right so what do we need Church we need the grace of God yeah we need the grace of God to understand this most people I've seen try to teach you they you know not in the message but without the understanding the message they just go right through like it's chronological order and of course you get all kinds of problems when you do that like who is at the Church of Latter day Saints they believe that right is the hundred forty-four thousand and they thought oh my you know we will have 144,000 believers and now there are church of millions you know and and they still say well there's only 144,000 of us that are gonna make it I wouldn't want to be part of that church would you know I wouldn't want to be I'd be one of them I want to be a part of the blood wash Church praise God the church that doesn't add to the Word of God that doesn't take away that just believes exactly what the Bible says amen so we of course we have a prophet that's done this almost said pastor but prophet we have a prophet that's done this he's given us das say the Lord not adding to the Bible just saying what the Bible says and then giving us thus saith the Lord now let's go through this here I turned off the volume shouldn't be playing there and let's look at I broke this down into themes okay so I broke it down to themes so the major theme of this book of this chapter is the open book that Christ opened in heaven coming to the earth to finish the mystery of God and to be prophesied to the entire world okay so that's the theme of Revelation chapter 10 we play it now now then I go to symbols and key revelations next so the key symbols are the mighty angel which will come up in a moment okay well this shows where it was formerly a sealed at so you know the scriptures there it was formally sealed with seven seals in Revelation 5 6 and 8 right because all the seals had to be broken so it was formally sealed up and now Christ is bringing his sealed book down to earth thank God amen so now we go to the symbols and key revelations here the first one is the mighty angel the second one is the little open book the third one is the cry with a loud voice as when a lion roars so those are the three great symbols or revelations in this chapter that I found you have a mighty angel coming down you have a little book open and then you have have the cry with a lot of voice as a lion's roar so if you have your Bibles let's take your Bibles Lydia maokai maybe if you could read that and you got a Bible back there okay now kind of okay yeah case you don't read all right thank you so Malachi why don't you go to Revelation chapter 1 Malachi verse 15 and 16 so this scripture proves that Christ is the mighty angel because the descriptions of him in Chapter 1 match the descriptions in chapter 10 and I think it'll come up here oh yeah we have the seven thunders or I'm sorry the seven thunders or key revelations as well the seventh angel and the eating of the little book these are all symbols that we want to understand so especially our little children let's perk up your ears let's let's make sure we get this that's really important so you can understand this they could think if you are living in the days of Jesus and think if the preacher said this scripture has been fulfilled in our day wouldn't that set your heart on fire wow this this book was written a thousand years ago and is fulfilled today this ought to set our hearts on fire amen this was written 2,000 years ago was it not and yet we're privileged we can stand here and say God sent a prophet gave us thus saith the Lord that this is history this has already come to pass I don't know any other church that can say that although the churches say oh it's for the future it's a pass or something like that but we can say it's happened in this day so we thank the Lord for that we glorify the Lord in that oh and there's one more ok the command for John to prophesy again to the entire world not sure how I missed that okay so the mighty angel this is Christ Jesus coming down to earth okay so Malachi read verse [Music] yeah read read chapter one 15 and 16 okay so in Rev in Chapter 1 Jesus Christ has that description maokai just read but in chapter 10 verse 1 he has the face as it were the Sun which matches chapter 1 where Jesus has his countenance as the Sun praise God so the next one I believe is there we go okay yeah the second one there his feet as pillars of fire in chapter 10 verse 1 a mighty angel that comes down and also revelation one his feet as if they were burned in a furnace amen so there you have two witnesses right and in the mouth of two or three witnesses then every word be established so this has to be Christ and of course there's many quotes or milligrams said that the seventh so that the mighty angels that came down was Christ all right so now we move now after we prove that now we move to the little book and this is a symbol that all the seven seals are now to be revealed upon the earth Christ has come down to reveal the identity of the four horse riders the souls under the altar the day of wrath and the silence in heaven at the moment of the rapture that's what Christ has come down to reveal okay so let me see if I put anything on here okay so yeah he reveals identity the four horse riders know that souls under the altar the fifth seal and the sixth seal the day of the wrath of the Lord and then seven seal now that's confusing to anybody the seventh seal has already been open in its speed in its symbol form but not in this reality form the reality opening is that brother Branham says it in message is that Feast of Trumpets remember I said the Feast of Trumpets the seventh seal is the day in the hour of Christ's coming so that part of the reality form of the seventh seal has not been open but the understanding of it the revelation of the seventh seal has and that is that it's is coming praise God but not the reality form because Christ hasn't come physically yet to meet us in the air now the next one is they can go to a moss three seven and eight is now we look at he comes down as when a lion roars okay so Lydia this mighty angel comes down and he roars with a loud voice as a lion's roar so lady can you read that please three seven and eight amen all right Jordan you see that when the Lord wants to speak he's gonna reveal something to one type of person a prophet and then he reveals that secret to the Prophet and the Bible compares it to a lion roaring and then it compares it to God speaking and prophesying through a prophet so this mighty angel comes down he's got the face like Christ he's got feet like Christ and now here he's roaring like a lion in other words he's speaking through a prophet praise God he roars with a loud voice as when a lion roars okay now next we do the seven thunders next cymbals the seven thunders okay now I got something here too the Bible foretold that Christ would reveal the mystery of the seven seals okay yeah so that through this we understand at the mystery the seven seals would be revealed now that book is fully open how many could say amen to that the book that comes down is fully open so all seven seals must be broken or some people today said all the seven seals not open well the reality's not happen yet but the revelation has we know it's the day in the hour like the brother Graham told us here so an open book comes down and say an open book a book with just but one seal still on it it's fully open and so the seven seals have been revealed praise God that's right now I think the next one is seven thunders okay no let's get past that I'm having trouble skipping there oh there we go all right okay now get your Bibles this is the one I want you to see here go to Psalms 18 then Psalm 29 let's read this right in the scripture here this is one of the most beautiful portions about the voice of God is Thunder I don't know if I ever have preset has anyone ever heard me preach that on the Psalms 29 I don't think I appreciate I did I forgot Tom's 29 well that's what 18 13 though first now can you read Psalms 18 13 then Lydia help me you'll help me on Psalm 29 okay yeah if you can do 18 13 sir alright so they're a thunder din in Psalms 18 Boyce the Lord is a thunder ain't no Psalms 29 it's a beautiful one now I've I prodded my brother Bram said I prodded and probe and tried to make these seven voices fit but I can't do it so if God gives you a revelation that'd be perfect from this morning's message share it with me if you if you can all right so let's go to Psalms 29 3 2 11 there are seven times in this chapter God said his voice is a thunder seven times and seven is the number of completion right and there's seven seals seven church ages seven five seven plagues seven everything so it seems like there's a mystery lay in here we're just waiting for the revelation of God okay verse three Lydia read three little why don't we wrote that you read three I'll read for would this rotate till we're done so go ahead with verse three sweetie well I'm sorry honey it's chapter 29 verse 3 sorry but I say wrong okay November the voice of many waters was brother have said the voice of many waters was water it was voiced is calling out a judgment against sinners I'm not sure but there's seven of these I'm not sure that fits but there seven numbers for the voice of the Lord is powerful the voice of Lord is full of majesty lydia verse nine alright verse six he maketh them also to skip like a calf Lebanon in Syrian like a young unicorn there is verse 7 Lydia divides flames of fire interesting verse 8 the voice of Lord shake at the wilderness the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh in Lydia verse 9 verse 10 the Lord sitteth upon the flood yay the Lord sitteth King forever and Lydia verse 11 alright so if you're counting I underline them seven times with read in my Bible there so I could come seven times God said his voice is like a thunder the voice of the Lord is like this the voice the Lord is like this so thunders represent the voice of God so when this open book came down it had to be spoken through a prophet and seven thunders under their voices now this is a firm everyone this is the one brother Branham uses in the seals John 12 let's go there John 12 28 and 29 down 12 28 29 I'll read that one father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying I both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him so some people think angels some people think Thunder Jesus heard the actual voice of God right the heavenly father but again a voice of God is attached to a thunder we see that so 3 more than 3 witnesses in the scripture so now we can see that Christ would speak through a prophet and that prophets teaching on the seven seals from the open book would be thus saith the Lord the voice of God spoken on the earth praise God now here's a good one - let's do this one let's do the seventh angel in verse 7 I don't know if I've ever read these with my family actually you read through the whole Bible but I don't think I ever pointed their mouth there's four verses that call men angels in the Bible men preachers as angels so I read that one already about the prophet teaching seven seals so if we hear it is yeah here I would just want to want to read with the children so Malachi get Galatians 4:14 Lydia can you get first samuel twenty nine nine and then i'll get this one at that word ii samuel 1927 so I'm sure church you if you've ever talked to anybody about brother Brandon being the seventh angel if you've ever talked about it they'll say well that says angel it doesn't say a man but then there's other verses that say oh did you know the did you know the seventh angel that blows the seventh trumpet is a literal angel did you know that so you have a seventh angel blowing a seventh trumpet for that seventh destruction and it's a literal angel but in Chapter ten you have a seventh angel that's a man so how do you know ones on earth ones in heaven that's how you know and you have to watch program so you got to watch their ministries here's an angel on the earth and he's sounding forth the mystery of the open book on the earth and you see the rest of the chapter they take that that book and it goes to all nations so that is clearly an earthly ministry the other one goes to seven ages that blow trumpets you know there's hail a third of the grass burns a third of the people die a third of the waters return the blood and then the seventh angel blows the seventh trumpet and I believe that's the third woe if I'm not mistaken as well and so you have to match the ministries match them to the rest of the Bible and then you'll see revelation 10 7 is a man on the earth because as as earthly ministry matches that of a preacher but the seventh angel with the seventh trumpet that's a heavenly ministry so you have to rightly divide the word of God and thank God that we had a prophet to do that for us so Malachi Galatians 4:14 this is where st. Paul's called an Angels who had Malka and that's something the church in Galatia thought so much of brother Branham they said you're like an angel even as what what does it say read that last part even as Christ Jesus Wow they had such a reverence for brother Paul and he had almost the level respect is the Lord Jesus so see he was an angel so see the things we believe is not wrong the things we believe about revelation 10 7 a mighty angel or I'm sorry revelation 1 about mighty angel come bring it down to the seventh angel that's scriptural it's at its absolute scriptural for a prophet to be called an angel okay so Lydia first samuel 29 nine that's david called angel okay cuz he he said don't let David go into battle he's like an angel of God to us alright second Samuel 1927 I'll read this one 19:27 and he has slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of God do therefore what is good in thine eyes so David twice is called an angel of God twice in revelation 22 8 9 if you got everybody can turn that in revelation 22 8 and 9 now this just brings a lot of joy to my heart I mean don't you wish when you were a child you could have got this instruction from the Word of God don't you wish Jose I wish Matt like I was telling who was I'd tone I thank God for the church I was raising but it was all just God loves you in John 3:16 and then speaking tongues and that's all it was that 7 that's all I learned about I never gotten into any deep teaching like this to understand what the symbols mean and how the angel can mean a man and the seals and the church ages nothing so we thank God that this generation our children can grow up and know the Bible amen revelation 22 8 9 and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren the prophets he's one of the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God this was not an angel like a heavenly angel this was a man someone who kept the Word of God he kept the sayings of God now there's a lot of guesses as to who this is and I'm not gonna make any guesses cuz I don't know if I ever got the revelation of course I'd tell you but I doubt it the point is though whoever whatever man this was it must have been and this must have been a theophany or something come down here he come down and gave these revelations to John he said don't worship Me I'm one of thy brethren the prophets and I keep the sayings of this book as well so it must have been a New Testament prophet perhaps okay so hope my children can understand that hope all the children can understand that that went by the Bible says in Revelation 10 7 that there's a seventh angel on the earth prophesy angel can mean a man it could mean a prophet on the earth because Paul was a prophet here's a profit right here revelation 20:2 8 9 okay eating the little book so Malachi first Peter 2:2 and Lydia why don't you go to Matthew 4:4 those are kind of familiar scriptures eating the little book is the next one it's getting there yeah Matthew 4:4 okay on the video then we just rely we reveal how we believe that was brother Branham okay okay so here's where I want to get to meal so eating the book is symbolic of believing and obeying the truths that Christ spoke in his revelations about the seven seals so you have to believe this open book all these revelations you have to believe that my brother and said all depends on your attitude write it off it's all about your attitude towards the message so Malachi first Peter 2:2 alright so Peter even says when you're a young Christian you enjoy the sincere milk of the word it's like milk to you okay and then Lydia Matthew 4:4 okay so we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God I have Matthew 5:6 and it says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled oh we got to be hungry when you come to church - amen we got to be hungry in this hour right because if you're hungry for it you'll be filled with that Jesus says praise God and you know what while we're there go back to Hebrews five that just kind of come to me there go to Hebrews five since we talked about milk and just so you know I'm teaching a middle school Bible Club - and I'm teaching on I taught on milk and not long ago and I showed them how milk is your beginning doctrines meat meat preaching is where you're able God gives you wisdom to discern good and evil in your daily life that's me teaching when you can each day wake up and see okay this is Satan trying to get in I'm gonna reject that and now I'm going to accept righteousness now you're eating meat praise God whatever word been revealed to you when the word is revealed to you and you receive that and then each day you can see oh this is a temptation I'm gonna turn this down I'm not going to talk about that not gonna look at that I'm not gonna submit to that now you're getting in the meat of God's Word hallelujah Hebrews five and so I ask the middle scores I said can you handle tea I said who knows about Melchizedek and they're like you don't know anything about Melchizedek that's the same thing I would have said right in middle school what do you know about Melchizedek I was that who's Melchizedek I couldn't even I couldn't pronounce that name probably until I heard the message of the hour and so I took the kids and showed him milk and meat and I used these scriptures because these are very familiar now verse 10 Hebrews 5:10 called of God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek of whom we have many things to say so Paul wanted to preach I'm not getting more and hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat so Melchizedek is more meat teaching right if you start getting into how God changes mask his forms you're getting to the three bodies that you have right theophany glorified flesh body you start getting into God changing manifests or forms manifestations not persons but manifestations you start getting into some deeper topics okay so verse 13 for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe but strong me here it is verse 14 but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen so when you are feasting on the meat of God's Word now you can see you can see Satan trying to get in and you you close them out you rebuke him you say get behind me Satan right you spew you a resist Satan and he flees from you and now you just remain in God's presence you remain under his anointing with fellowship with God now you're eating meat praise God that's right but see most can I just show it like this let me uh I'll just pull it up real quick so I think I got in the teaching I did with the middle schooler here right here yeah I just talked to him not long ago yeah I said this is what this is literally literally this is what most denominations do in fact the church that I used to go to before I was the message they would show a circle and at each of the four parts of the circle they would have like love grace salvation and service and they admitted we just go around and around the circle we never go to deeper things of God and even before the message I knew something's wrong with that and that's what Paul is telling the Hebrew Christians they just go around the same things love your neighbor be gracious right God's grace is for you the prodigal son the Shepherd going after the Sheep which we appreciate all those good things but Paul says if you can't discern Satan your daily life then you're then you're just drinking milk all the time and you can't understand Melchizedek you can't understand anything deep you can't really get it because you're just going around and around in a circle drinking milk all the time you see we got to go beyond that in terms that's that we that's what we're desire to do is go deeper with the Lord right to be able to feast on the meat of God's Word so that that in that case no sin could become in our church right there be no leaven amongst us there's be no wickedness there be no evil thoughts there'd be no backsliders right because backsliding is when you give place to the devil you get tricked and you don't you don't cast out the devil we want any of that amongst us we want to be pure when we walk in obedience to the Holy Spirit I don't know about you but if I go a few days without eating meat brother Johnny I get kind of frustrated you know I like you I like meat I don't feel full right don't have a good chicken or a good steak or something like that or you know shrimp or something some type of meat but see Paul says we cannot live like this and this is what I was teaching the middle schoolers and I was saying how God is bringing us up on a teaching God wants us to graduate and go from elementary and the deep things of God I was teaching this with the kids there the milk teachings there's six milk teachings there in Hebrews five and now I'm getting into this now I'm on the kingdom of heaven with the middle scores we just went through the first mystery of the kingdom of heaven I don't think I have it on here but bro Graham talks about those in services is the end time so these are at least some meat teachings they're Melchizedek and discerning or judging good versus evil and so you can look at churches and you can see like if the pastor if I make a mistake and I let my let's say I let my wife start wearing a little makeup or cutting her hair now pretty soon that would be awful sin right because that dishonor that dishonours me that designers Christ and pretty if if that would be the case then that shows I don't have spirit of discernment and I'm just drinking spiritual milk when it comes to the Word of God and we know megachurches and the message that even allow women to cut their hair and wear makeup yet they're big huge churches what does that say about the church that says they're not a very mature Church when you start letting little things the little sins in and saying it's okay that's drinking them from the milk of God now I appreciate God's milk but I'm hungry for some meat in the head I deliver I'm gonna be a real mature Christian praise the Lord now see I hope you can understand that by God's grace okay so I know maybe I'll have to spend much time on that but I want to show you there that that's important for us to have that we got to have that deep teaching and so eating the little book then God the voice tells John eat the book so John has to eat those seven seals and I say this often but the one of the most rewarding sermon series I've ever preached was the seven seals back in 2008 and 2009 that was the one of the most rewarding series I've ever preached kind like the church ages that we just got done with last year it was so rewarding and I didn't even realize his sister Whitney but this is what I was doing I was eating the book have you ever done that have you ever gone through the seal look really slow that's what I did I highlighted Thalia highlighters at the bottom or highlighters they just take and just meditate on that what was it I doing I was feasting on the Word of God starting to understand God's use of symbols what a symbol stand for what does oil represent what a horse's represent what does white represent the colors and and all these what is dark and the dark ages in history what does it give you it gives you a deep understanding of the Word of God and then when you see that Antichrist white horse rider try to write into your life then you can cast them out in Jesus name that's right amen or you see a complex trying to rise up and get you bitter against some brother or sister in the church you can cast that down and say no I'm gonna love that person in Jesus name see you can sense that white horse rider because now your eyes are open you you understand you've eaten the open book it's a part of you now you're a mature Christian and you can discern when Satan's trying to get into your life praise God thank the Lord does that help by God's grace I hope my children versus Malachi wasn't in here so huh hopefully gets that one on the later on okay let's go forward here now see this is so important and these are little teachings and remember brother Ram wish he could have done this he would she wished she could have went through all of his revelations one by one on the book of Revelation I'm glad we get to go do it here okay now the command for John to prophesy again to the entire world that's in let me read that that's revelation ten eight I believe and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth now Lydia prognosis and maybe Malkin acacia but John represents the bride right because John got caught up in chapter 4 after the church ages ended there at least there and just like the bride gets caught up at the end of the Laodicean Church eh and that finishes the Gentile Church age so John the bride has to go eat the Seventh Seal message that's come down from heaven Jesus loose the seals brought it down to earth so then he takes the open book and it's revelations and spreads the truth around the world finishing Jesus's Great Commission alright that's a revelation I'm sorry Matthew 28:19 and 20 but we're very familiar with that I don't need to read that okay let's forward a little bit here okay we talk about next is John we are talking about this John symbolizing the the bride of Jesus Christ yeah let me just see if I can fast forward what was easier earlier I don't know why it's so hard now to do that yeah so John just like John said come up here they're in for one immediately after the seven church ages and the revelation chapters two and three he was caught up hither right after the seven Church Ages so John represents the Bride of Christ okay now I end the video by showing the timing of events so I show how revelation 10 one two seven is fulfilled there we go there we go so Jesus uttered seven thunders or the revelations of the seven seals through his prophet William Branham in 1963 so we say that is finish and that was a hundred years after the Emancipation Proclamation glory amen let's see what else is on there okay so yeah I just quote brother Branham basically and say revelation 10 1 to 7 is in the past so right now we're in the fulfillment of Revelation I'm sorry revelation 10 8 to 11 now let's read verse 11 this yeah this is just come to my heart here let's read verse 11 I'll read it and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings now does that sound familiar recently what we preached let's go to revelation 7 in revelation 7 is a multitude a great multitude of people that comes from peoples nations tongues and kings right so see how this is not chronologically in order in Revelation 10 they're still going out and prophesying again taking the same prophecies from this open book from the messenger brother Branham and taking them around the world but in Revelation 7 we see that group it's a completed group and they're there with palms worshiping the Lamb of God amen oh yeah let's see it's not in order and you've got to make the scripture line up in the right order okay revelation 7:9 and this I beheld right after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and Kindred's of peoples and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands there's that Gentile multitude praise God so see revelation 10 verse 11 proves this is before the rapture because after the rapture God's done with the Gentiles God's not going to the Gentiles God's going to get his Jews he's going back to get his his Jewish people that he now took off the blindfold he's going back to get his Jewish people so see revelation 10 proves this is still in the Gentile church age and that's where I said Church remember that quote BAM said you don't see the church remember from revelation for two 19's every remember that program said that but here revelation 10 we see the church and that's one more reason why you can't make every word brother Branham said thus saith the Lord as we went through that quote I think of two ends days ago both have said see you don't see the church anymore from revelation four to nineteen well here's the church mother and said thus saith the Lord that was him that that just happened to the church in Revelation 10 so what does the new Church it makes us rely more upon what the Holy Spirit rather than putting all the emphasis on brother Branham now just so you know this week I was just washin dishes a couple of times I thought well I want to see what what is uh what are they preaching that Branum Tabernacle with Joseph bread well they're preaching so I went on this guy's website and I listened to some and they are teaching that the tapes and this is an exact quote because I kept it they're teaching that the tapes is the word they say I have the exact quote from one of brother Rams children I'm not gonna say which one but you can probably guess and I love I love them dearly but they said the tapes which is the word and I looked up your brother branham ever say the tapes is the word no brother bear never said that so the people that are saying we only say with the tapes they only say what the tapes they only say what the tapes they're not saying what the tapes say are you with me and I laugh because you know I I don't mean to laugh but I'm not making fun of them but it just you know it's striking isn't it striking the very people that they play the tapes only played tapes now they're letting people preach to them before they play the tapes and give them off in many cases not all but in many cases of false interpretation of those tapes yeah okay and another one this is what I called the gentleman out on and that's why I'm preaching it because I called him out on these things and he didn't reply he replied one time and he changed the subject instead of answering my questions he changed to something else he said what do you believe it about which parts of the message do you believe I said well according to brother branham's quote from the rapture 1965 brother Ram said the message of the hour is the Bible truce that God is revealing right now so I said I believe all the Bible message I said but I don't believe every word on the tape is thus saith the Lord okay and so the next one is there's a quote brother Graham says let me pull it up he said Joseph will do double everything that brother Branham did I don't want the exact phrase yeah it's in he says he'll do double okay yeah here it is now when I dedicate him the Lord that morning there was many baby standing and had mothers with them among the altar along the altar when I picked up Joseph in my arms not thinking what I was saying I said Joseph my son thou art a prophet that's my prayer anyhow so see he's not saying they'll say the Lord said that's just my prayer anyhow and I believe it'll be that God will take everything that he ever gave me now think about that he's the prayer lines everything he ever give me are you serious and I heard that and I thought I gotta ask this guy does he believe that and double it times doubles what's double time double four times two times two is that right I do teach first grade I don't teach a multiplication yet but I think that's right Nobel times double two times two four and put that on my boy then then when I leave that he'll take my place so I said to your brother I said I write this in all humility with all love to Joseph and everybody the family but has Joseph done double the prayer lines and discernments that brother branham has done and I said can you show me on tape how he's prophesied double thus saith the Lord's than his father and I said I had to come and I like to come and get into the sermon line if he's doing double because then he can meet double needs of the people and I could probably get caught up and get discerned in the line guess what no didn't say didn't you mention a change of subject what do you believe about the message which parts do you believe about the message and Hosea was there earlier voice of God number Hosea I said you were there I don't remember if I said can you show me one time brother Joseph on this old and not repeating his dad and they said no no see they already see that Oh see I'm laughing because I'm happy because we're in the truth and I'm not we're not exalting our but where would you find God would you find God amongst some big movement or would you find God in the little humble little flock and so see church when people get when people really get the wrong spirit and you try to correct them with it either they'll get mad or they'll just ignore it and this week I found out some of them just ignore it you don't write back they know what they don't they don't want to answer this question but I think I read this one to you a while ago brother branham said my Joseph was with me the whole time I think he said that yo so who's with me remember brother Jose when I preached that you remember that ok let me try to the exact quote was with me what you say all along no yeah something that he was with me anyway swear I'm sorry if I can't pull it up right now that's that's too many anyways the point was before Joseph was born God told him you can have a Joseph and at one point brother branham thought that Joseph was Billy PAH and he says it on tape now what are you gonna do if you're if you're a person that says every word on the tape is I'll say the Lord what are you gonna do with that one now you got Joseph you know Billy Paul Joseph but now you have another Joseph now you have two Joseph now where do you find that in the scripture so see it's just humility it's just being led by the right spirit right si lord have everything I have everything I believe to be founded upon the rock of the Word of God and not to go off on fanaticism okay so I don't know how I got there on that but I just thought I'd share that there so I believe revelation 10 107 was fulfilled in 1963 in revelation 10 ather 11 is command for John to prophesy the open book of the seven seals and that's being refilled right now church shouldn't that humble us that when we sent brother Simon we paid for Simon's ticket to go to Thailand that should humble us that were fulfilling revelation 10 8 to 11 we're taking a little part in that thank God for the big churches right thank God they can send him to Japan and Europe and New Zealand and everywhere they sent him the Philippines you know thank God but we are in the process of fulfilling that and where we can just thank God that he gave us a little part in that trying to find Prix des seeds taking these prophecies taking them to the world okay so John represents a new church we're I'm sorry the New Testament church we're familiar with that I think that's the ending there by God's grace now is there any questions I would like to take this time to answer questions anybody have any questions this is a pretty familiar chapter any other questions any questions on chapter 10 all right now I think I'd better just stop there don't thing I'm gonna go to chapter 11 because I'm I'm already tired from this morning in Chapter 11 is quite a fulfilled chapter so I would I've been studying on the mysteries and numbers course and then times and seasons that got a little sermon coming up on that that's a really interesting thought we look at times and seasons hopefully the next few days by God's grace ER and weeks rather well let me think I guess we'll stop right there by the grace of Lord is there anything else I thought I wanted to mention here West's and to our feet I think we'll just close right there we'll be done Revelation chapter 10 let me just look through there one more time as you're standing here there's anything else I have on my heart to share write help us out the last thing I'll say is that brother branham said the seven thunders are already revealed now I've talked with both Simon about this Simon thinks the thunders are still going to sound in the future the Simon preaches this for us often and I love brother Simon that's just one thing we just differ on just everybody knows if you've heard him you probably heard him when I'm gone he'll mention the seven thunders and that's just where we differ there are a couple quotes her brother makes it sound like that but then quotes later that I've found especially in the church age book brother Branham says that the thunders have already been revealed in the seals so to me when brother man preached the first seal on that day in March that was the first Thunder second seal second thunder he preached the third seal third thunder and it just was seven thunders right over right in a row that's the way I teach that but just so you know if you hear brother Simon say that or when brother cam comes I think they both believe that and to me that doesn't hurt our fellowship at all unless I would say well well you're not as good as me you're not a good as Christian as me because I believe they're already revealed or if they would vice-versa but it's never been like that it's always been in godly love praise the Lord in church if there's anybody that should be able to love Christians should be us because Jesus said you'll love you know my disciples because they have love one for another Branson if you can't bitterly disagree with somebody and then shake their hand at the ends help you love him he said it's time to go back to the altar is that right hey man come on Malka I think that's it I think if I think that's one thing I didn't really labor on but I preached recently on the seven thunders and so I didn't really feel led to spend much time on that one okay I think that's it so the last thing I was just you know with my youtube ministry like I tell I've told you before I feel like that's me doing my part to prophesy again because I'm not prophesying myself necessary now there may be some times when I'm preaching and God anoints me and I don't even know it there could be that but most of the time when we prophesy again we're just saying what brother branham already said and that's one of my most popular videos I was gonna look it up real quick was the was the future prophecies of brother Branham it's one of the most popular ones let me look that up real quick just so you're familiar with that one yes number 5 and did you know make up in the Bible just passed a 200 1000 views so I was really happy with that to me that's going viral if I get 200,000 views on a video that's viral so yeah I was just I was rejoiced no today yeah we've has 200,000 for make up in the Bible it's interesting people want to know about sanctification right now my most popular videos or sanctification make up long hair long dresses and modest clothing the top 4 and then 5 is future prophecies of brother Branham which has 31,000 views so to me when I made that video that's what I was doing since I can't go to all the nations I can put though I can do this I can put brother branham's prophecies out there and let that sound forth and now God just like God use the printing press right to spread the Bible and the teachings of Luther and the message of the hour now God is using Internet to do the same thing take this message where I could never go amen and if you see in the book there you know when it comes out I'll get you a copy for our home church people here and of course any visitors if you want to and there's some extra here you can have one I'm gonna order some when they get ready but there's testimonies from all over the world where people said all I'm done with makeup in New Zealand or I'm done with this in Africa you saved my soul you know different people through this ministry because it's it's doing what Revelation 10 says to do eat the book and then prophesy again amen and I'm sure you feel like that don't you feel like that when you when you read brother branham say thus saith the Lord the mark of the beast don't you feel something in your soul don't you feel the Holy Spirit prophesying in you like we get to be microphones right we get to be Mike's just repeating that letting the Holy Spirit speak that same prophecy through us like I've worn my mom I wore my friend bangs brother I warned them to their face and said we have thus saith the Lord every denomination is going to take the mark of the beast and what am i doing I'm prophesied God is prophesying through me God's prophesying through you so as we got to do is eat the little book have you enjoyed the eating the book tonight I trust uh I know that most of us who've been around the message have have heard some of these things before most of them which is good but I won the children especially to hear these things and you know when you were a little boy Malachi and Tim Meyers had a little little son - we sat there and talked and we said we're gonna give Bible studies and we're gonna teach our children the Word of God and now I get to do it we you know we do Bible time every night at home and my daughter's over there all out well most of them but you know we were just really exhausted I mean we're men right so where's else for our boys like we wanted to grow up and be man you know of course we love our girls too but the point was we're standing there and I said I'm gonna teach him the message so he knows the message like I didn't know I didn't know the message growing up but I can make sure my son knows the message right and that's what we want to do with all of our children make sure they know thus saith the Lord make sure they know the Word of God and then there'll be lights and witnesses just like we are praise the Lord all right let's just bow our heads here for word of Prayer what a blessing it is to eat this little book [Music] before we pray how many raisins just pray for me that I'll keep eating that little book and I might be able to prophesy all peoples and every people that comes [Music] I think we want to be faithful [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all the way I'm just trying to think because Lord your words and your prophet [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] our take just keep taking our God [Music] the Lord the sardina light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
