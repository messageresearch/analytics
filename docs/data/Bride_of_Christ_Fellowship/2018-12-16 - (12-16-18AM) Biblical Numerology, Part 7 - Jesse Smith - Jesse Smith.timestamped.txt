[38:52] let's tear as we get our Bibles grease
[39:05] [Music]
[39:16] it's good be in-house of Lord tonight by
[39:18] God's grace let's go to Isaiah chapter
[39:29] 11 here just uh you know scripture like
[39:35] to read and then we'll have you be seen
[39:52] just a moment here let's take as a
[39:54] chapter 11 verse 1 and 2 I like to
[39:56] preach on biblical numerology again this
[39:58] is part 7 I'd like to return to that
[40:01] thought I've been trying to finish up
[40:03] the series that I've started so I can
[40:05] move on to some other ones there's some
[40:06] other ones I have a I'd like to really
[40:08] preach but I want to finish up some of
[40:10] these first by the grace of Lord but
[40:14] Isaiah chapter 11 verses 1 & 2 notice
[40:19] this is a six fold anointing on Christ a
[40:24] six fold anointing so this Holy Spirit
[40:28] on Jesus Christ would produce six
[40:31] attributes let's look at Isaiah 11 1 & 2
[40:36] verse 1 and there shall come forth a rod
[40:39] out of the stem of Jesse and a branch
[40:42] shall grow out of his roots let's read
[40:45] verse 2 together one two three and the
[40:48] Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him
[40:50] the spirit of wisdom and understanding
[40:54] the spirit of counsel and might the
[40:56] spirit of knowledge and of the fear of
[41:00] the Lord of course we know this is
[41:01] speaking of Christ amen
[41:02] so the Holy Spirit anointing would have
[41:05] this six fold blessing upon his life how
[41:09] many can say praise the Lord let's bow
[41:12] our heads in word of prayer here
[41:13] Heavenly Father Lord we just come
[41:15] reverently Lord as we just say give us
[41:17] clean hands and pure hearts Lord God
[41:19] father we're seeking your face this
[41:21] morning Lord God and father we want to
[41:24] hear from you Lord we just ask that your
[41:26] Holy Spirit would speak through me Lord
[41:28] freely I wouldn't hinder it dear God and
[41:30] it would hear through each and every
[41:32] person Lord that we would not just be
[41:34] hearers of the word but we would be
[41:36] doers of the word help us Lord to hear
[41:39] and do today father God speak through
[41:41] Lord these lips of clay and Lord may
[41:44] your Holy Spirit manifests himself Lord
[41:46] God amongst us we just ask that you move
[41:49] amongst us freely Lord God you would
[41:51] accomplish your purpose for this service
[41:53] today and we ask it all in Jesus
[41:55] Christ's name and the church said Amen
[41:58] God best she was being seated praise God
[42:02] can you switch over there Lidia see if
[42:04] we got it on here okay that worked out
[42:16] pretty good also brother I wanted to
[42:20] thank brother Aaron you know he gave me
[42:22] this prayer cloth brother McCormack got
[42:25] it from Perry green and so I'm gonna
[42:29] take that to that boy today I don't know
[42:31] if you heard but one of the boys in my
[42:32] class has a tumor on his brainstem so
[42:34] we've been I was praying for him and I'm
[42:38] gonna preach with this on today cuz I
[42:40] know I know the same God that was on
[42:41] brother Branham is on me because I
[42:43] preached the same message I've only seen
[42:45] a little fraction of the same results
[42:46] but I've seen some of the same results
[42:48] so I know the same God that was on
[42:50] brother Branham is with me and just kind
[42:53] of has a refresher just to kind of look
[42:56] at the scripture you know the Bible said
[42:57] I wrote it on there so that hopefully
[42:59] the family can see it acts 19 11 and 12
[43:02] and God wrought special miracles by the
[43:04] hands of Paul so that from his body were
[43:07] brought
[43:08] unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons
[43:10] and the disease is departed from them
[43:13] and the evil spirits went out of them
[43:15] amen so we know we know I even mentioned
[43:18] on Wednesday you know I wasn't even
[43:19] thinking about this but it's not it's
[43:21] not there's no virtue in the cloth but
[43:23] at what the cloth represents this cloth
[43:25] represents that a man of God was
[43:27] anointed of the Holy Ghost to do great
[43:29] signs miracles and wonders was anointed
[43:31] with thus saith the LORD preached in our
[43:33] generation manifested the Holy Ghost in
[43:36] our generation and now we have the same
[43:39] faith praise God we are believing in the
[43:40] same God that he preached the Lord Jesus
[43:43] Christ so let's look at these numbers
[43:47] here I like to look at just six seven
[43:49] and eight again you know I'm gonna try
[43:52] not to repeat myself too much and I'm
[43:55] gonna try to preach 45 minutes today I'm
[43:59] gonna try all right so let's look at
[44:01] this thought here and I want to actually
[44:05] want to look down and I want to go to
[44:06] this slide real quick I just thought of
[44:10] it from the first sermon and I preached
[44:12] on this thought I want to just show the
[44:16] quote from brother Branham about numbers
[44:19] why God uses numbers yeah he's known by
[44:24] his number so I wanted to read that
[44:26] three is the number of perfection we all
[44:27] know that three is God's number in his
[44:29] numerology God is known by his numbers
[44:33] so you know as I was talking to my wife
[44:37] last night you know as I've studied
[44:38] these thoughts you know sometimes it's
[44:41] it's more challenging to find numbers in
[44:43] your own life but today you know if you
[44:48] can't find specific numbers in your life
[44:50] take courage in the numbers that God has
[44:53] placed in the Bible and what it means to
[44:55] you so for example number six means the
[45:00] number of man it could mean fallen man
[45:02] but can also mean anointed man and so
[45:05] you may not be able to recognize a six
[45:07] maybe while I wasn't born I was in the
[45:08] sixth child or you know I wasn't I don't
[45:11] have six letters in my name or but don't
[45:15] necessarily get hung up on that so much
[45:17] focus on what it represents in other
[45:20] words I want to be anointed of the whole
[45:21] the spirit help me to get anything out
[45:24] of my life that's keeping me from being
[45:26] anointed of the Holy Spirit and so forth
[45:28] number seven is completion so Lord in
[45:31] other words if you can't find a seven
[45:32] well I'm not the seventh child or I'm
[45:34] not my name doesn't have seven letters
[45:36] in it like brother Branham or something
[45:37] like that
[45:38] don't so much focus on that but focus on
[45:41] God you have completed a work on the
[45:43] cross and take courage in what the seven
[45:47] means to your spiritual life if you if
[45:50] you can't find something specifically
[45:52] about you know your life with the number
[45:54] don't worry about that but take courage
[45:57] and what God's numbers represent what
[45:59] he's trying to get you to see today and
[46:01] the church said amen so remember let's
[46:05] just go over some of these meetings you
[46:06] know number one represents preeminence
[46:08] or unity that's what number one
[46:10] represents and that's what Christ the
[46:12] mystery of God revealed is all about
[46:14] there's one great mystery that God wants
[46:16] to have preeminence in your life in my
[46:18] life number two brother Branham says it
[46:21] means division
[46:22] it means difference testimony and it can
[46:25] also mean friendship or unity as well a
[46:28] unity of two so we know what the number
[46:31] two represents number three represents
[46:34] divine perfection or life the prophet of
[46:37] God says because Jesus rose on the third
[46:39] day and there's so much in nature that
[46:42] has threes involved in it there's three
[46:43] parts to this and three parts to that so
[46:46] we know it's God's perfection when God
[46:49] divinely designed something he often has
[46:52] three parts to it
[46:53] praise the Lord for of course is the
[46:56] number of deliverance that's the earth
[46:59] that's a number of other RAM says of
[47:00] double confirmation sometimes you have
[47:02] four witnesses to something brother
[47:04] grams let's see that's a double
[47:05] confirmation it's also an earthly number
[47:09] God does different things on the earth
[47:10] God does it for like there's four winds
[47:13] there's four directions you know the
[47:15] number four is related to earthly things
[47:18] five
[47:20] it means grace or favor if you see a
[47:23] five in your life it means labor and
[47:25] grace
[47:26] it also means Redemption God uses number
[47:29] five in Redemption number six we'll look
[47:33] at a little today we'll look at a little
[47:35] more
[47:35] six is the number of fallen man and
[47:37] fallen beasts it's also the number
[47:40] though of anointed man thank God and
[47:42] it's also used as a measure of time the
[47:45] number six is for time of course so is
[47:48] seven as well so Bob Arum says now one
[47:51] thing I got here are five things I like
[47:53] to speak up just a second just as quick
[47:54] as I can
[47:55] there's seven sevens there's five sevens
[47:58] and God's plan of redemption five is the
[48:01] number of grace now he knows that j esus
[48:03] fa ith five is the number of gray six is
[48:06] the man's day and seven is his day of
[48:09] redemption so six the sixth day if you
[48:13] just take one moment and remember the
[48:15] six day you know so often sixes looked
[48:18] on as a bad number but when God did the
[48:20] number of six in the beginning it was a
[48:22] great number it was the very height of
[48:24] his creation day six the beasts of the
[48:27] field but after that was man man who has
[48:31] made not an image of beasts but the
[48:33] image of God amen and so six is the
[48:36] man's day when God made man he made him
[48:38] an anointed man praise God he didn't
[48:40] have any sin he was perfect he was
[48:43] complete and so God 6 is always a good
[48:47] thing when it's anointed of his spirit
[48:49] now here's some more I found in the Old
[48:52] Testament there are 6 things under man's
[48:55] dominion according to Psalms 86 so in
[48:59] order for him to have dominion over 6
[49:01] he's got to be anointed right and 6
[49:04] represents the anointed man praise God
[49:06] the Bible said house made him to have
[49:08] dominion over the works of thy hands
[49:10] that was put all things under his feet
[49:12] Amen hallelujah now I'm thinking about
[49:14] Devils this morning I'm not thinking
[49:17] about sheep and oxen I'm thinking of how
[49:19] demons are under our feet amen but he
[49:22] says all sheep or oxen yea the beasts of
[49:26] the field follow the air the fish of the
[49:29] sea and then 6 whatsoever passes through
[49:32] the pass of the of the seas amen six
[49:35] fold Dominion that man has over the
[49:38] earth he said O Lord our God how
[49:41] excellent is thy name in all the earth
[49:44] remember Christ anointing would have a
[49:47] 6-volt blessing now to
[49:49] Church this looks like that Christ would
[49:51] have the full armor of God on because
[49:53] remember there's six pieces in the armor
[49:55] of God how remember that from the
[49:56] message we preach in it there's not
[49:58] seven there six there's six parts to the
[50:02] armor of God and so here Jesus Christ is
[50:05] said to come out of the stem of Jesse
[50:07] the branch of David we know and then the
[50:10] Bible said he'd have wisdom
[50:12] understanding counsel might knowledge
[50:17] and the fear of the Lord amen hallelujah
[50:21] praise God that's what that's what the
[50:23] Bible lists amen and you know God
[50:26] doesn't guess with numbers God doesn't
[50:28] play around with numbers when he lists
[50:30] numbers they have a meaning praise God
[50:32] this is how God would be known Jesus
[50:34] Christ would be known as a man anointed
[50:37] of the Holy Ghost and a power and he
[50:40] died and rose again that we might have
[50:42] the same anointing on us Dave a
[50:45] hallelujah that's exactly right
[50:48] did you know the anointing of the
[50:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost was to be on
[50:52] all flesh which means six-fold manner Oh
[50:57] the Bible said the Holy Ghost would fall
[50:59] on all flesh and then it says this
[51:01] should come to pass afterward I'll pour
[51:03] out my spirit upon all flesh and this is
[51:05] what all flesh means your sons so
[51:07] Malachi you can have the anointing on
[51:08] you it can fall on you your daughters
[51:11] all my six daughters the anointing can
[51:13] fall on you your old man we got any old
[51:16] men here today just me your old men
[51:19] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[51:22] see visions amen and also upon the
[51:26] servants servants and upon the hand
[51:28] maids in those days will I pour out my
[51:31] spirit a church you can pray and ask God
[51:34] now say God let your Holy Spirit fall on
[51:36] me because I'm a servant I'm a handmaid
[51:39] I'm a young man I'm a son I'm a daughter
[51:41] I'm an old man let your spirit fall on
[51:43] me you promised it would fall on all
[51:46] flesh amen hallelujah all flesh all man
[51:50] it would fall anyone who'd be willing to
[51:53] come God's provided way praise God for
[51:56] the anointing which is confession
[51:57] hallelujah confess your sin unto God
[52:00] make your request made known unto God in
[52:02] the peace
[52:03] of God that passes all understanding
[52:04] will keep your hearts and minds clear
[52:06] through Jesus Christ that's right so
[52:09] it's a six fold manner because six is
[52:11] the number of man and the number of
[52:15] anointed man is the number six is in a
[52:17] striking church right
[52:20] did you know Israel's endowments as
[52:24] God's people were six fold did you know
[52:26] that they had a six fold blessing upon
[52:29] them because they were anointed right
[52:31] they were anointed of God's Spirit on
[52:33] the on the the flesh and the the human
[52:36] spirit look what Paul says he says who
[52:39] are Israelites and whom pertaineth the
[52:41] adoption see God adopted them God they
[52:45] were down in Egypt and God said out of
[52:47] my out of Egypt have I called my son
[52:49] amen oh yeah he adopted that he called
[52:53] them out of Egypt and he took him for
[52:55] herself that they might serve Him in the
[52:57] wilderness and he might place his
[52:58] adopted son in the promised land amen
[53:00] and the glory and the covenants see
[53:05] covenants and the giving of the law

[1:00:20] the seventh action is a prayer so once
[1:00:23] you got those six now you can go to
[1:00:24] action now it's time to pray praying
[1:00:27] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:00:29] the Bible says once you got the full
[1:00:31] armor of God on what you're anointed
[1:00:33] then it's time to pray that's the
[1:00:34] program says you got to get in the
[1:00:36] anointing first then you pray then you
[1:00:38] act on the Word of God he said people
[1:00:40] get baptized but they go down so they go
[1:00:43] down a dry sinner they come up a wet one
[1:00:45] because they never gotten the anointing
[1:00:48] or the revelation of the word repent
[1:00:50] they've got to really repent they've got
[1:00:52] really died out and then when they come
[1:00:54] up they'll be forgiven and fill it the
[1:00:56] Holy Ghost amen but see so many people
[1:01:00] go down they repented they come up the
[1:01:01] Holy Ghost doesn't come upon them they

[1:01:35] Pole and to me that's a confirmation of
[1:01:38] God's anointed prophet Isle they lujah

[1:01:48] yeah he says the number of man six times

[1:01:53] because it's the number of man the
[1:01:54] anointed man the man who speaks the word

[1:02:02] then some member Satan imitated the
[1:02:03] number six Satan had one of Goliath have
[1:02:06] six fingers and six toes yeah all right
[1:02:13] is that a good reminder by God's grace
[1:02:16] okay all right let's go to number seven
[1:02:19] now so I just want to review that as
[1:02:20] I've been studying these last few days
[1:02:23] I've come across those I want to make
[1:02:25] sure I give those to you by God's grace
[1:02:26] see now if you don't have a six in your
[1:02:29] life don't feel bad but one thing you
[1:02:30] can you can get on the six pieces of
[1:02:32] armor of Jesus Christ and you can be a
[1:02:34] soldier for Jesus Christ today I don't
[1:02:36] want to be a soldier amen
[1:02:38] start with your mind that's the first
[1:02:39] thing gird about the loins of your mind
[1:02:42] don't let anything contrary to God's
[1:02:43] Word get any place in your thoughts cast
[1:02:46] out anything that's exalts itself
[1:02:47] against them the Word of God and bring
[1:02:50] into captivity to the Holy Spirit amen
[1:02:55] so brother
[1:02:57] seven again his completion now the last
[1:02:59] time I preached it back in September I
[1:03:00] think it was September 15th I preached
[1:03:02] on the number seven so just review
[1:03:05] program said everything's is in threes
[1:03:08] there are three is a perfect number five
[1:03:10] is a number of gray seven completion
[1:03:13] twelve worship twenty-four or forty
[1:03:17] temptation fifty is the Jubilee the very
[1:03:19] word Pentecost means Jubilee fifty now
[1:03:22] God in His numerals he's perfect in his
[1:03:26] numerals I believe that so in each of
[1:03:29] these cases where God had sixes or
[1:03:31] sevens or eights
[1:03:32] God is perfect in them he's trying to
[1:03:34] get us to see something that will help
[1:03:36] us today and help us to better know him
[1:03:39] by His grace now these are ones already
[1:03:44] shared last time I just I just think I
[1:03:45] highlighted what just one yeah I just
[1:03:47] did one Joshua's army marched around
[1:03:49] jericho seven times on the seventh day
[1:03:51] with seven priests bearing seven
[1:03:54] trumpets of ram horns
[1:03:55] going before the ark so that was going
[1:03:58] to be a complete God was completely
[1:04:00] gonna deliver Jericho in the hand of
[1:04:02] Israel completely he was going to
[1:04:04] complete it that day so it was a lot of
[1:04:06] sevens that day and the member had a
[1:04:11] shout and Trump I'm still looking for
[1:04:13] the voice there I know there's got to be
[1:04:14] a rapture type there I'm still looking
[1:04:16] for the voice because there's a shout in
[1:04:17] the trunk there's got to be a voice
[1:04:18] laying there I just got to pray more and
[1:04:22] 7000 men did not bow the knee to bail in
[1:04:24] the days of Elijah the seven naming the
[1:04:28] leper had to dip seven times in the
[1:04:30] Jordan River to be cleansed and that's a
[1:04:32] type of the seven church ages in order
[1:04:34] for the whole church to be cleaned and
[1:04:36] all be together
[1:04:37] remember Hebrews 11 wrote about it how
[1:04:39] they died in faith I had not have you
[1:04:41] received the promise what were they
[1:04:42] doing they were waiting on you and I and
[1:04:45] if we die then we'll be waiting on the
[1:04:47] next generation that comes is that right
[1:04:49] everybody in the body of Christ is
[1:04:51] waiting to come to full completion and
[1:04:54] we'll all come to completion at the
[1:04:55] rapture amen that's when the body of
[1:04:57] Christ will be finished amen that's a
[1:05:01] type of that it's he was he was
[1:05:02] completely healed he was made totally
[1:05:04] whole on the seventh praise God the
[1:05:07] seven dip for us the seven church age
[1:05:11] here's some new ones I haven't shared
[1:05:12] yet so now this is all new there's no
[1:05:15] review now seven classifications for
[1:05:18] living things in nature I remember
[1:05:19] learning this in high school I learned
[1:05:20] this I memorized it kingdom phylum class
[1:05:23] order family genus species of all living
[1:05:25] things have a Sevenfold classification
[1:05:28] anybody learned that lately
[1:05:29] anybody Lydia not yet okay I was a
[1:05:32] junior when I learned it cuz I remember
[1:05:33] the class I was in there's seven colors
[1:05:36] in the rainbow
[1:05:37] Roy G Bev red orange yellow green blue
[1:05:39] indigo and violet seven days in a week
[1:05:43] these are all completions so colors
[1:05:45] completed in seven living things are
[1:05:48] completed in seven different categories
[1:05:49] there are seven days a week as completed
[1:05:52] in Swiss seven days there are seven
[1:05:54] openings to the head two eyes two
[1:05:56] nostrils two years in the mouth it's
[1:06:00] completed there's there's seven notes
[1:06:03] and music I think that's right
[1:06:06] I should ask Malachi and amen now seven
[1:06:12] is rest because God worked for six
[1:06:14] created on the seventh he rested he was
[1:06:17] completely done so he rested on the
[1:06:19] seventh he knock the seventh from Adam
[1:06:22] walked home in a rapture showing that
[1:06:25] when a person's really complete they're
[1:06:27] ready to walk home and go home with
[1:06:29] Jesus in the seventh generation from
[1:06:31] Adam again a type of the seven church
[1:06:34] age as well the Laodicean bride the
[1:06:36] bride who's alive and remain will walk
[1:06:39] out of laodicea to meet Christ in the
[1:06:42] air she'll walk right out of here amen
[1:06:45] a week equals seven years so it's a
[1:06:48] period of time it's a complete period of
[1:06:50] labor we'd say because a week is seven
[1:06:53] years Jacob had to work a week for Leah
[1:06:56] and then another week for Rachel so
[1:06:59] that's a complete period of time
[1:07:03] David had not I put a question mark
[1:07:05] after this one David had seven other
[1:07:07] brothers that were refused he was the
[1:07:09] eighth so seven might be complete
[1:07:12] refusal I don't know that's just my
[1:07:15] guess on that one I'm not quite sure but
[1:07:19] Abraham's Abraham had a Sevenfold
[1:07:22] blessing how many know that if you go to

[1:07:34] less that's a great man thou shalt be a
[1:07:37] blessing so to others I will bless them
[1:07:41] that bless thee so anyone who blesses
[1:07:43] you I'm blessing them amen glory anyone
[1:07:46] that curses you I'm cursing him in thee
[1:07:50] shall all families of the earth be
[1:07:51] blessed

[1:07:55] Abraham by faith in Jesus Christ how

[1:11:40] other than well that's how represents
[1:11:42] how Jesus you know there were a husband
[1:11:44] and wife bird right and the husband had
[1:11:46] to die for the female praise God and
[1:11:48] Jesus had to die
[1:11:49] for our cleansing amen we took that
[1:11:52] blood seven times the leper was sprinkle
[1:11:55] with that blood on the day of atonement
[1:11:58] now this is the day when every sin from
[1:12:01] the past year would be forgiven blood
[1:12:04] was sprinkled seven times as a sin
[1:12:07] offering for the people he would take of
[1:12:10] the blood of the bull hock and sprinkle
[1:12:12] with his finger but I'm sorry upon the
[1:12:14] mercy seat eastward and before the mercy
[1:12:17] seat shall he sprinkle the blood with
[1:12:19] his finger seven times this is sound
[1:12:22] like God likes the number seven and
[1:12:24] blood blood and seven that's right
[1:12:27] here's one I preached on last year it
[1:12:30] was such a powerful move of the Holy
[1:12:32] Spirit the red heifers blood was
[1:12:34] sprinkled seven times before the
[1:12:36] tabernacle so before anyone could be
[1:12:40] forgiven or any proselyte could be
[1:12:42] brought into the Jewish camp they had to
[1:12:44] be clean before they can even come
[1:12:45] behind the curtains even into the outer
[1:12:47] court and began in order for this to be
[1:12:50] possible the pure or the red heifer had
[1:12:53] to be killed and that blood had to be
[1:12:54] sprinkled seven times and brother
[1:12:56] Branham said that was blood for every
[1:12:57] church age before you and I could even
[1:13:00] be baptized there had to be a blood
[1:13:02] there that would already cleanse us amen
[1:13:04] there had to be a blood that would
[1:13:06] already forgive us and that was a shed
[1:13:08] blood of Jesus Christ shed to forgive
[1:13:10] all seven Church ages amen glory now the
[1:13:16] New Testament there were seven offerings
[1:13:18] from a boy that Christ multiplied five
[1:13:21] loaves plus two fishes it was a complete
[1:13:24] offering complete offering which led to
[1:13:27] the feeding of a multitude praise God
[1:13:30] and I think church when we completely
[1:13:32] offer ourselves to God don't we see a
[1:13:33] real a real multiplication of blessings
[1:13:36] don't you see that and then there's so
[1:13:39] much blessings there's leftover
[1:13:40] blessings there's fragments one one
[1:13:43] place as twelve baskets other one said
[1:13:46] seven baskets leftover there's so many
[1:13:48] leftover blessings when you fully
[1:13:49] sacrifice your heart to God give up
[1:13:53] everything for Jesus after six days so
[1:13:56] on the seventh day Jesus took three
[1:13:58] disciples up to Mount Transfiguration I
[1:14:00] got 15 minutes this is actually going
[1:14:02] pretty good for done
[1:14:03] believe it or not and Jesus went to show
[1:14:07] them the preview of the rapture
[1:14:09] it was after 6:00 on the seventh praise
[1:14:12] God and of course that was because the
[1:14:15] rapture would be in the seven church age
[1:14:19] Enoch was the seventh from Adam Peter
[1:14:23] and six men entered into car News's
[1:14:26] house when the Holy Ghost fell yes amen
[1:14:30] seven complete amen they're gonna get a
[1:14:33] complete baptism amen I like that now
[1:14:37] you know there's seven spiritual
[1:14:39] attributes that complete a believer
[1:14:42] who's then ready to be born again so
[1:14:44] that completely sanctifies them can I
[1:14:46] say like that let me write that real
[1:14:48] quick whoops complete sanctification
[1:14:50] there I just want to make sure I don't
[1:14:54] get that I don't forget that complete
[1:14:58] sanctification how many believe in
[1:15:05] complete sanctification program said
[1:15:08] when you're cleaned out fully then God
[1:15:10] will come in fully amen
[1:15:12] but if there's still things that are
[1:15:13] lingering in your life and heart that
[1:15:15] you haven't given up to Christ you've
[1:15:16] got to give him up and then he'll come
[1:15:18] in all the way
[1:15:19] praise God that's right
[1:15:22] because that's what the Word of God says
[1:15:24] there's there's seven and then the
[1:15:26] eighth will get you now
[1:15:27] is charity the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:29] so God does a complete Sevenfold
[1:15:32] sanctification work in your life and
[1:15:34] then he caps you off with eternity amen
[1:15:36] now eights really got two definitions
[1:15:39] these are just the same because I use or
[1:15:41] here so it can either mean eternity or
[1:15:43] the first day again whatever you want to
[1:15:45] say or it can mean a new creation or a
[1:15:48] new start a new beginning that's what I
[1:15:53] think God gave our church a new
[1:15:54] beginning and wasn't that in the eighth
[1:15:56] month yeah August wasn't it when we had
[1:16:00] that flood I think it was glory
[1:16:04] well that just struck me right here amen
[1:16:08] hey we always want to know where we
[1:16:10] where we stand with God don't we yeah we
[1:16:13] uh well thank the Lord amen
[1:16:16] I wasn't ready for that one church age
[1:16:19] book chapter 2 let's see what the Bible
[1:16:21] teaches us about the Sabbath rest now of
[1:16:23] course he's getting the Sabbath for he
[1:16:25] that is entered into his rest this
[1:16:26] entering in is not only entering in but
[1:16:29] remaining in the rest it is an eternal
[1:16:32] rest of which the seven-day is but a
[1:16:34] type 7 is completion 8 is the first day
[1:16:38] again Jesus resurrection was in the
[1:16:41] first day of the week giving us eternal
[1:16:44] life and eternal Sabbath rest so see
[1:16:48] that see Jesus resurrection is is two
[1:16:51] numbers it's number three life and the
[1:16:53] number eight for eternity new beginning
[1:16:56] so his resurrection fulfilled two
[1:16:59] numbers their life and then eternity
[1:17:02] eternal life thus we see why God could
[1:17:06] not give us any one certain day of the
[1:17:09] week as the Sabbath rest we've entered
[1:17:11] into and do and do remain in our rest
[1:17:14] which Israel could not do having only a
[1:17:17] shadow of the true substance which we
[1:17:19] enjoy why go back to a shadow when we
[1:17:22] have reality now amen thank God
[1:17:25] hallelujah first we got such a reality
[1:17:28] in the Old Testament it would sacrifice
[1:17:30] those animals and the Bible said their
[1:17:32] conscience would remain guilty the next
[1:17:35] time they come back and sacrifice but
[1:17:37] you and I by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:39] can confess our sin and our conscience
[1:17:42] can be cleaned that's because God
[1:17:44] delivers us from any demon powers and
[1:17:46] we'll never do it again
[1:17:48] praise God he completely dens in
[1:17:51] delivers us from our addictions and
[1:17:53] habits and all these things and our
[1:17:55] conscience is not defiled I do not live
[1:17:57] with a default conscious that I'm still
[1:17:59] smoking or I'm still cussing I'm still
[1:18:01] drinking or I'm still addicted to this
[1:18:03] or that we don't live with that because
[1:18:04] the Bible says God's given us eternal
[1:18:06] life we're in our New Covenant and our
[1:18:09] conscious our clean by the blood of
[1:18:11] Jesus Christ amen
[1:18:13] it's a rest its eternal life we should
[1:18:16] know that he turned that he has entered
[1:18:17] into us I'm resting in God's Spirit I'm
[1:18:25] resting in God's life are you resting in
[1:18:27] that today
[1:18:29] you've ceased from your old works of the
[1:18:31] world and now you do the works of God
[1:18:34] thank you lord
[1:18:37] here's where he says its new creation in
[1:18:39] the future home seven days watch which
[1:18:42] passed away or I've said we'll change to
[1:18:45] another eight days now we're going to go
[1:18:46] through this quote here in a few moments
[1:18:47] the full quote eight days deals with new
[1:18:51] creation see not all creation eight days
[1:18:54] is new creation yeah it was August
[1:19:01] because the Graham's letter last Sunday
[1:19:03] here was on the first Sunday of the
[1:19:04] August so just now that just came to my
[1:19:07] mind yeah so God's doing something new
[1:19:09] in starting in the eighth month glory
[1:19:12] now he says charity now charity eight is
[1:19:16] the number of new creation
[1:19:17] so when God's holy spirit also known as
[1:19:21] charity also known as love when that
[1:19:23] comes down and caps somebody off with
[1:19:25] the baptism of the holy ghost they are
[1:19:27] not out a new creation in Christ day men
[1:19:32] they're a new creation the old things
[1:19:35] have passed away
[1:19:36] they're so passed away the Bible said
[1:19:38] they're sealed out they're locked out
[1:19:40] they're shut out amen never more to be
[1:19:43] returned because they're sealed out to
[1:19:45] the day of our Redemption so see the
[1:19:49] Holy Ghost or charity is the eighth and
[1:19:51] final virtue or attribute in the statute
[1:19:54] perfect man
[1:19:55] because God's fear is immortal or
[1:19:57] eternal so it works either way whether
[1:19:59] you say new creation or eternity eight
[1:20:01] works either way as charity in the
[1:20:04] statute of a perfect man so God gives
[1:20:06] you first second third fourth fifth
[1:20:08] sixth huh godliness God anointed
[1:20:11] anointed man godliness man like God
[1:20:14] brotherly kindness and then charity love
[1:20:18] amen
[1:20:19] new beginning praise God a fresh start
[1:20:22] you're finally ready to live once you're
[1:20:24] born again amen you're finally fit to
[1:20:27] live on this earth once you're born
[1:20:29] again and eternal life has come into you
[1:20:32] you're immortal a part of you is
[1:20:33] immortal and eternal you've had a new
[1:20:36] creation amen
[1:20:39] now brother Branham says now you just
[1:20:41] turn the leaf over you said
[1:20:43] the leaf over you got a brand new leaf
[1:20:45] hallelujah you got a brand new branch
[1:20:48] you got ready
[1:20:49] you got brand new life amen hallelujah
[1:20:52] when the real Holy Ghost comes upon you
[1:20:54] you live a new life
[1:20:57] it's eternal life now it also means the
[1:21:02] first day again now here's where we look
[1:21:04] at a future home just for a few moments
[1:21:07] I'm almost done with my 45 minutes -
[1:21:09] Jesus resurrected on the first day of
[1:21:12] the week so it's the first day again so
[1:21:14] it's the eighth day the first day of the
[1:21:17] week is a week has seven days well when
[1:21:19] you start a new week now it's the eighth
[1:21:20] day from that first day
[1:21:23] now the Bible said there would be a holy
[1:21:26] convocation which is a sacred assembly
[1:21:28] or Sabbath a day of rest where all the
[1:21:32] Jews who are resting and not working
[1:21:34] would all come together and assemble for
[1:21:36] a holy day a day of worship a holiday
[1:21:39] and it would be on the eighth day of the
[1:21:42] Feast of Trumpets all right bless you
[1:21:49] now remember the spirit let's start here
[1:21:53] this is the spiritual year of Israel
[1:21:55] starts in mid-march they have two years
[1:21:58] they have a civil year and they have a
[1:22:00] spiritual year the spiritual year starts
[1:22:02] here with the Passover and they have
[1:22:04] seven months first the spiritual year
[1:22:06] the civil year is about the middle of
[1:22:09] October and goes to the beginning of
[1:22:12] March that's called this civil year so
[1:22:14] months eight nine ten eleven twelve
[1:22:16] that's the civil year I like how the
[1:22:17] spiritual year has has more months in it
[1:22:20] don't you seven to five I like how God
[1:22:24] divided it so for seven years they're in
[1:22:26] a spiritual year and God said there's
[1:22:28] really just three main feasts but within
[1:22:30] them we know there's seven yeah but
[1:22:33] there's really three main ones the
[1:22:35] Passover now he calls that the
[1:22:36] unleavened bread God calls that feast of
[1:22:38] weeks in the Feast of Tabernacles those
[1:22:40] are the three names that we call the
[1:22:43] through the feasts of Israel but inside
[1:22:46] of them they have other feasts like the
[1:22:47] Passover is first then the feast of
[1:22:49] unleavened bread then the feast of
[1:22:51] firstfruits so that was Jesus's death
[1:22:56] here and then that was the day between
[1:22:57] his crucifixion and the first fruits was
[1:23:00] his resurrection amen so this is Friday
[1:23:03] Saturday Sunday praise God Amen already
[1:23:07] fulfilled now here's where we're at now
[1:23:09] we are in this feast right now we're in
[1:23:11] the feast of weeks the feast of weeks is
[1:23:14] summertime isn't a pretty hot
[1:23:16] spiritually Church isn't it pretty hot
[1:23:19] does the Bible say that those Hebrew
[1:23:21] children that have got turned up seven
[1:23:23] times hotter praise God it's hot it's
[1:23:27] harvest time amen
[1:23:29] but we're gleaning but if the Lord of
[1:23:33] the harvest hasn't come back then
[1:23:34] there's still work to be done amen and
[1:23:36] the II said just pray he said just pray
[1:23:40] that I'll send forth laborers out into
[1:23:42] the harvest amen
[1:23:44] God just needs a labor God just needs
[1:23:47] somebody who labor in the hot
[1:23:51] discouraging strenuous age that is
[1:23:57] Laodicea but thank God for the former
[1:24:01] range sister Connie but thank God we got
[1:24:06] a former rate the teaching rate of
[1:24:08] Malachi four five and six amen oh and
[1:24:12] you know if there's a former eight then
[1:24:14] there's got to come a ladder ain't a net
[1:24:16] wrap string fake they men hallelujah
[1:24:19] because it's thus saith ax I'm sorry
[1:24:21] Joel chapter 2 if there's a former rain
[1:24:24] there's got to be a ladder rain to come
[1:24:26] to finally harvest this that this
[1:24:29] harvest here at the end before the
[1:24:31] trumpets blow and gather all Israel back
[1:24:33] for the Feast of Trumpets oh my let me
[1:24:38] say like this church we've already
[1:24:39] gathered by the gospel trumpet hey yeah
[1:24:42] and there'll be one more trumpet that's
[1:24:45] gonna sound shout very strum the the
[1:24:48] Trump of God and when that trumpet blows
[1:24:50] you'll hear your name crawled your body
[1:24:52] will be swallowed up in the feel for the
[1:24:55] glorified and you'll go to meet your
[1:24:56] theophany in the air amen that's the one
[1:24:59] trumpet were waiting for amen hallelujah
[1:25:02] it's exactly right oh my and when this
[1:25:06] rapture goes Church then the trumpets
[1:25:08] will blow in Israel we gather
[1:25:10] they're ready for their day of atonement
[1:25:11] by Mercy Lord and of course their David
[1:25:15] toment was on the tenth day of the
[1:25:17] seventh month and that's when they'll as
[1:25:19] we said on Wednesday night that's when
[1:25:20] they'll go from house to house and say
[1:25:22] we've crucified our Messiah they'll
[1:25:25] mourn from this the house of behind the
[1:25:28] Bible said to the house of Zebulun and
[1:25:31] they'll more from house to house and the
[1:25:33] Bible said when nature veil
[1:25:35] they'll give birth in one day a man how
[1:25:39] do their yeah and so see that they then
[1:25:41] they get born again so if you want to be
[1:25:43] born again if you want more of God
[1:25:45] you've got to travail until God brings
[1:25:48] for something in your life amen glory
[1:32:10] I seem to agree with him but humans have
[1:32:13] only been on the earth about 6,000 years
[1:32:15] and brought that lines up with what
[1:32:17] brother Branham said he said it could
[1:32:18] have been millions and he said billions
[1:32:19] of years they can now measure the
[1:32:22] distance light travels they never canoe
[1:32:26] before and to travel east certain
[1:32:28] distances in this space it had to be
[1:32:30] about 14 billion years old
[1:32:35] so the flood was after 2,000 years God
[1:32:37] does something every 2,000 years doesn't
[1:32:39] he he had it but a flood after the first
[1:32:41] 2,000 and then he brought the cross
[1:32:43] after the second 2,000 now we are in the
[1:32:46] seven church ages were finishing up the
[1:32:48] sixth day and then the holy fire will
[1:32:52] come after that right and then the
[1:32:56] seventh day of course will be the
[1:32:58] millennium that's the seventh day now
[1:33:02] this is where program teaches in the
[1:33:03] future home so that millennium is the
[1:33:06] seventh day God finally gets his seven
[1:33:09] day with no interruption of sin but the
[1:33:12] eighth day is the new heavens and the
[1:33:14] new earth it's also called the New
[1:33:16] Jerusalem okay how does that make sense
[1:33:21] by God's grace this is what brother I'm
[1:33:23] saying the Feast of Trumpets had the
[1:33:26] celebration that was I'm saw the Feast
[1:33:28] of Tabernacles I was on the eighth day
[1:33:29] and program saying well people say well
[1:33:32] you don't have anymore eights and he's
[1:33:33] like yes I do the seventh day is the
[1:33:35] Millennium the eighth day is the future
[1:33:37] home God give us an eighth Church
[1:33:41] Alleluia
[1:33:42] so don't feel bad if your name has eight
[1:33:43] letters in it or you're the eighth child
[1:33:45] or something like that or you're born in
[1:33:47] the eighth year no don't feel bad about
[1:33:49] that it's a good number praise God all
[1:33:51] these numbers are good numbers when
[1:33:52] God's with the numbers amen
[1:33:54] saying this ain't over every one of
[1:33:56] those numbers so don't take Satan's
[1:33:58] perversion takes God take God's
[1:34:00] beautiful creation amen his purpose
[1:34:03] behind his numbers take that no two
[1:34:06] seven days only has to do with all
[1:34:07] creation world time seven days that's
[1:34:10] the money on the rest day and God
[1:34:11] labored six days rested on the seventh a
[1:34:14] church labor six days and rests on the
[1:34:16] seventh ha ha oh ha our Labor's almost
[1:34:19] over church
[1:34:21] just keep working keep laboring for
[1:34:23] Jesus do everything you can for Christ
[1:34:24] keep labor and it's almost a seven-day
[1:34:27] it's almost the millennium but you're
[1:34:31] still in a time element I ain't speaking
[1:34:33] of the eternal but you see there's no
[1:34:34] such thing as eight days you go back the
[1:34:36] first day I see the first day the
[1:34:39] Sabbath speaks of the old law which was
[1:34:41] the pass away the keeping of a Sabbath
[1:34:43] which passed away orbs or if I said or I
[1:34:45] have said change to another it didn't
[1:34:48] pass away just change from the old law
[1:34:50] of keeping a certain day of the week so
[1:34:53] the Saturday Sabbath from the Old
[1:34:55] Testament has changed and now it's not
[1:34:57] that we keep a literal day it's that we
[1:34:59] keep ourselves in the baptism of the
[1:35:01] Holy Ghost we rest from our works and
[1:35:05] now we crucify ourselves you know we let
[1:35:09] we crucify the lusts of the flesh and
[1:35:11] all these things the affections they're
[1:35:12] up and now we let the Holy Spirit work
[1:35:14] in our lives that's the true Sabbath
[1:35:16] today and the church said but I like to
[1:35:21] I tell the Sabbatarians I've had a lot a
[1:35:22] mail me the last year I tell them you
[1:35:24] know I said the Sabbath is the baptism
[1:35:26] Holy Ghost but but just just for you
[1:35:29] know just for your sake God give me a
[1:35:30] rest day and it's it's it's Sunday
[1:35:32] Sunday is now my Sabbath like if you
[1:35:34] want a physical day of rest I don't work
[1:35:36] on Sunday I never go to work on Sunday
[1:35:37] but I'm working for Jesus but that don't
[1:35:41] count
[1:35:41] because you can wear the priests could
[1:35:43] work on the Sabbath day and Jesus said
[1:35:45] well you were your priests work on the
[1:35:46] Sabbath but they blasting the Sabbath he
[1:35:48] said but God forgives them because
[1:35:49] they're doing God a service amen that's
[1:35:51] the same thing I say God built our day
[1:35:53] of rest our physical day of rest right
[1:35:55] into today you're enjoying rest aren't
[1:35:58] you nobody's got to go well air might
[1:36:01] have to go toil tonight but on most
[1:36:03] occasions you don't have to toil on
[1:36:04] Sunday oh not tonight well glory amen
[1:36:10] but see God he gives us the spiritual
[1:36:13] the real meaning of the Sabbath is to be
[1:36:15] born again but he also builds into it
[1:36:18] the first day of the week sunday is our
[1:36:20] day of rest we shouldn't work if we can
[1:36:22] possibly help it on the day of rest
[1:36:23] Sunday God builds it into our schedules
[1:36:28] and it's true let me just go back to say
[1:36:30] that I preach now for 14 years and I
[1:36:32] preached many of those Sundays and I
[1:36:34] preach
[1:36:35] I heart out I preach my voice out and
[1:36:36] every time I've never missed a Monday so
[1:36:40] see that proves I worked all day Sunday
[1:36:42] but God didn't count it as work and I go
[1:36:44] to work the next day and I got strength
[1:36:46] to go to work the next day that proves
[1:36:49] it right that's right that's what
[1:36:51] Willie's proves it to me maybe not you
[1:36:53] but it proves it to me you enter into
[1:36:55] life not keeping a day or shadow Paul
[1:36:57] said over there in Hebrews the fourth
[1:36:58] chapter you keep gazing shadows and
[1:37:00] things like that I'm scared of your
[1:37:02] experience he says see we don't pass in
[1:37:04] the certain days in orders we passed
[1:37:06] from death unto eternal life not days
[1:37:09] and times you pass into eternity that's
[1:37:12] the holy convocation rather seven days
[1:37:14] watch which pass away or I've said we'll
[1:37:17] change to another eight days deals with
[1:37:19] new creation see not all creation eight
[1:37:21] days is new creation it for it was on
[1:37:26] the eighth day that our Lord raised from
[1:37:28] the dead he said there's your other
[1:37:29] convocation the holiness not considering
[1:37:32] the Sabbath at all or the Feast of the
[1:37:34] Tabernacles feast of that Feast of
[1:37:35] Pentecost Jesus raised from the dead for
[1:37:37] our justification on the eighth day
[1:37:39] after the seven Sabbath's or seven days
[1:37:42] seven Church Ages Jesus raised from the
[1:37:44] dead
[1:37:44] eighth day which is holy convocation see
[1:37:47] which is the first day now I got a few
[1:37:52] more slides here let me see yeah I'm
[1:37:53] almost done yeah I'm almost done I only
[1:37:56] got three more slides well there you go
[1:38:00] it can mean a new beginning like we saw
[1:38:03] in August the glory of the Lord fell on
[1:38:06] the eighth day when the Aaronic
[1:38:08] priesthood offerings for the people to
[1:38:10] make atonement for them found the eighth
[1:38:13] day the leper was declared clean at the
[1:38:17] door of the congregation you guessed it
[1:38:19] on the eighth day he got a fresh start
[1:38:23] he went to church seven he couldn't go
[1:38:25] to church but on the eighth day he
[1:38:26] finally goes there and the priest says
[1:38:27] you're clean
[1:38:28] have a fresh start welcome in the church
[1:38:30] welcome back brother
[1:38:31] good to have you back it's a fresh start
[1:38:33] for you you're clean welcome back to
[1:38:35] God's fold amen the pride of the son
[1:38:39] received eight witnesses of his new
[1:38:43] beginning the father fell on his neck
[1:38:45] kissed him game
[1:38:47] Oh gave him a ring gave him shoes killed
[1:38:50] the fatted calf ate it and then he said
[1:38:52] let us make merry eight things for a new
[1:38:55] beginning oh thank you Jesus amen
[1:39:00] I love how God is trying to tell us
[1:39:02] something he's trying to tell us he's
[1:39:04] trying to make himself known to us the
[1:39:10] paralyzed Aeneas I'm not sure how to say
[1:39:13] that heal by Peter and the eighth year
[1:39:14] of his infirmity just see Satan could
[1:39:16] have easily whispered Oh see here in the
[1:39:18] eighth year you know sevens sevens
[1:39:22] completion and five is grace you already
[1:39:24] past the fifth year God's not gonna have
[1:39:26] any grace on you see how Satan will live
[1:39:28] to lighten people's minds like this but
[1:39:31] see God uses it for another reason God
[1:39:34] can use any of his numbers since he
[1:39:35] created them he can use them all for his
[1:39:38] glory and so Satan he wouldn't take
[1:39:41] Satan's words he said well Peters a man
[1:39:43] of God and Peter prayed for him and he
[1:39:45] was healed of his infirmity in the
[1:39:46] eighth year the eighth year oh thank you
[1:39:51] Jesus David was the youngest of eight
[1:39:54] sons he was number eight see God was
[1:39:58] beginning something new he was beginning
[1:40:00] with a king after his own heart he was
[1:40:03] starting something new because member
[1:40:06] Saul was chosen by men right
[1:40:08] God said I'm gonna do something new I'm
[1:40:10] gonna get a king after my own heart
[1:40:12] and it was so new that he said I'm gonna
[1:40:13] let that the priesthood of David go
[1:40:15] right so the priesthood of David lasted
[1:40:17] all those years amen
[1:40:20] till Christ came there was eight souls
[1:40:23] were saved by water during the flood
[1:40:25] would they get they got a brand new
[1:40:26] beginning when they come out and
[1:40:27] sacrificed brand-new beginning eight now
[1:40:32] the lot this
[1:40:33] a Hebrew boy was circumcised on the
[1:40:35] eighth day and I thought maybe it's
[1:40:37] because he's a new male member of the
[1:40:39] Covenant because without the
[1:40:41] circumcision you were not part of the
[1:40:42] Covenant so in order to be in the
[1:40:45] Covenant you had to be circumcised on
[1:40:46] the eighth day so it seems like he has a
[1:40:49] the the male has a fresh start a new
[1:40:52] beginning he's a part of the covenant of
[1:40:53] Abraham that's what it seems like to me
[1:40:55] I could be wrong no that's why I put a
[1:40:57] question mark let's say an or fee
[1:41:00] satan's invitation of eight this is the
[1:41:02] only eight that I can find right now
[1:41:04] that were Satan's trying to use the
[1:41:07] eight to kind of imitate God the Beast
[1:41:11] which I think seems to be the person the
[1:41:13] Antichrist in revelation 17 11 is the
[1:41:16] 8th King which some people say is a pope
[1:41:18] which it could be I think we've talked
[1:41:20] now we talked about that brother Aaron
[1:41:21] okay because something some people were
[1:41:24] counting the number of popes like to see
[1:41:28] what number this Pope was so it was just
[1:41:31] interesting I'm not sure if you I or
[1:41:33] somebody else talked about that but this
[1:41:36] beast is the 8th King and he's of the
[1:41:38] seventh King and then he goes into
[1:41:39] perdition which which means Hellfire or
[1:41:42] destruction because perdition means
[1:41:44] destruction so this 8th King will exalt
[1:41:48] himself above all that's called God as
[1:41:49] the Antichrist but then he'll be judged
[1:41:51] by the Word of God Jesus Christ now as
[1:41:54] much as he tries to imitate imitations
[1:41:57] will never work it's got to be genuine
[1:42:00] now I come to the piano how many 1 a
[1:42:02] genuine walk with the Lord today we
[1:42:04] don't want to imitation Church we don't
[1:42:07] want to be pretend just play Church we
[1:42:10] want to be the church we want to be
[1:42:13] written epistles known and read of all
[1:42:17] men and we want people to say about us I
[1:42:20] don't know how what school they been to
[1:42:22] I don't even know if they've been to a
[1:42:23] school but one thing we know they've
[1:42:25] been with Jesus how many want that in
[1:42:28] their life praise God
[1:42:31] let's have about have a word of Prayer
[1:42:34] to us bow our heads here as we pray
[1:42:38] chair
[1:42:38] think about that if you really want to
[1:42:43] be a genuine Christian if there's
[1:42:44] anything you need clean out of your life

[1:42:48] like you're annoying to the Holy Spirit

[1:42:55] humanity that I'm keeping the blessing
