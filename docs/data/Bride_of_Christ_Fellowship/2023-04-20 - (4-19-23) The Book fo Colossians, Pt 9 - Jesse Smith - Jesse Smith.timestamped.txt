[2:57] saint said
[2:59] amen God bless you as you're being
[3:00] seated praise God
[3:04] all right praise the Lord so I don't
[3:06] have any slides here tonight
[3:08] just didn't have time I was going a
[3:09] different direction and I thought
[3:11] I kind of felt led to go back this
[3:12] direction so we'll preach out here by
[3:14] the grace of the Lord
[3:16] Colossians chapter 3 we're finishing up
[3:18] the chapter here we're coming down to
[3:20] this section
[3:21] and we looked at family last time
[3:24] and we're looking at here Christianity
[3:26] in the home praise God we want to look
[3:28] at that here tonight and then go down
[3:30] into chapter four
[3:31] we looked at chapters one and two
[3:34] and we've seen Paul's
[3:37] inspiration from the Holy Spirit he
[3:39] greeted the Saints in chapter one he
[3:41] prayed for the Saints this beautiful
[3:42] prayer say my same prayer I prayed for
[3:44] the Amish community
[3:45] we saw the Supreme deed of Jesus Christ
[3:47] in chapter one The Power of Jesus's
[3:49] cross in chapter one The Mystery of
[3:51] Christ in us the hope of glory at the
[3:54] end of chapter one praise God then in
[3:56] chapter two we saw the treasures all the
[3:58] treasures are in the mystery of the
[3:59] godhead in other words all the treasures
[4:01] in the Holy Spirit in Christ Jesus the
[4:04] fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ
[4:06] bodily like you've heard it said Jesus
[4:08] wasn't in the godhead the godhead was in
[4:11] him
[4:12] right trinitarian say Jesus is one
[4:13] member in the godhead but the godhead
[4:15] was in Jesus Hallelujah and then we saw
[4:18] how the Colossians would have to have to
[4:21] overcome enticing words that's very
[4:23] similar to what we're going through
[4:24] today we're not battling swords or and
[4:26] guns are not being you know jammed into
[4:27] our necks and making us try to recant
[4:30] Christianity but it's enticing words
[4:33] it's words that our friends and loved
[4:36] ones and hopefully not church members
[4:37] but sometimes
[4:39] people outside the faith will try to
[4:42] whisper things and and talk to us and
[4:44] deceive us and and uh
[4:47] and we've got to weigh all those words
[4:49] by the word of God
[4:51] and uh
[4:54] I just thought maybe I'd share a
[4:56] personal experience but maybe I'll say
[4:57] that for later
[4:58] uh after that after the enticing words
[5:01] you know they had to overcome
[5:02] philosophies
[5:03] and then Jewish legalism
[5:05] and that's things that we can relate to
[5:07] around the message you know some people
[5:08] are legalistic about things and if they
[5:11] don't if other churches don't do it
[5:13] their way they're not saved or they're
[5:15] not really messy Believers and
[5:17] we've got to constantly contend with
[5:20] that praise God we have enticing words
[5:22] Satan know either injecting to our minds
[5:24] or through other people
[5:25] and then we've got to overcome things
[5:27] that we hear
[5:29] and legalism
[5:31] uh and then the chapter two ended with
[5:33] overcoming mysticism you know you hear
[5:35] you hear about a lot people had dreams
[5:38] or people heard or talked to an angel
[5:41] now especially around the message people
[5:42] have dreams but all those dreams got to
[5:45] be taken back to the word of God
[5:46] and all these all these guys rising up
[5:49] now getting out of the preachers they
[5:50] rise up and say well I'm the great one
[5:52] to rise after brother Branham an angel
[5:53] spoke to me well let me look at your
[5:55] life for a few a few minutes here by
[5:57] God's grace let me let me examine what
[5:59] you're trying to tell us about that and
[6:01] and then we'll be able to exactly see
[6:02] where you stand on the word of God we'll
[6:04] be able to judge you by the fruits of
[6:05] your life praise God but uh overcoming
[6:09] these things was part of the Colossians
[6:10] battle again it wasn't it wasn't
[6:12] battling flesh and but in all reality
[6:14] Church it never is battling flesh and
[6:15] blood
[6:16] wherever your source of your problem is
[6:17] it's really never against that person or
[6:19] that that group it's the spirits that
[6:21] are behind it praise God and church
[6:23] that's what I love like even in any
[6:24] trial I can I can take my mind off what
[6:27] I see and I can just close my eyes or I
[6:28] can just look up to heaven say Jesus I
[6:30] know you're in charge of this situation
[6:32] I know if I go to you I go above all the
[6:35] trials right I go above all the doubts
[6:37] all the fears I know if I go to Christ
[6:38] I'm going to the highest Authority
[6:40] praise God
[6:41] and I know Jesus Will plead my case of
[6:43] the father praise God that's what the
[6:45] Bible says he makes intercession for us
[6:47] to the heavenly father how many believe
[6:49] your heavenly father really cares for
[6:51] you praise God really you really believe
[6:52] you're a child of God after singing
[6:54] about that twice tonight
[6:55] you're really a child of God praise God
[6:58] that means god your father hears all
[7:00] your prayers amen and he's going to
[7:02] minister according to his perfect will
[7:05] in your life praise God and now chapter
[7:07] three we looked at this in the first
[7:09] four verses our our Focus if we're risen
[7:12] like I preached there at brother cams
[7:13] for the resurrection service how many
[7:15] risen in Christ if you are resurrected
[7:17] in Christ like Jesus resurrected if
[7:19] you're resurrected in your soul and your
[7:20] body and your mind
[7:22] then set your affection on things above
[7:24] praise God focus on the Heavenly things
[7:27] and then verses 5 through 17 were
[7:30] specifics we need to mortifying
[7:32] Christian Living
[7:34] oh thank God we're saved by grace you
[7:36] had nothing to do with it and now but
[7:37] now you've got something to do with
[7:38] mortifying the desires of your flesh
[7:41] isn't it something salvation has nothing
[7:43] to do with you but everything after
[7:45] salvation has everything to do with you
[7:47] that's a good thought I never I never
[7:49] said like that before so I thank the
[7:50] holy spirit for that tonight
[7:51] salvation has nothing to do with you but
[7:54] sanctification and the baptism of the
[7:55] Holy Ghost and Beyond has to do with you
[7:58] praise God because then didn't Peter say
[8:00] make your calling and election sure
[8:03] didn't Paul say approach your salvation
[8:06] with what fear and trembling
[8:09] so there's going to be times in our
[8:10] Christianity isn't that interesting
[8:11] there's gonna we're saved by grace we we
[8:13] should have joy we should have joy
[8:15] unspeakable fully Glory we can dance
[8:17] around here right like I told my barber
[8:18] he's like you guys dance around the
[8:20] church what is that like
[8:21] it's pretty awesome it's pretty freeing
[8:25] praise God but you know we can go from
[8:27] that and then and we're being so happy
[8:29] but then God will allow the trials of
[8:31] our life to bring us to a point where we
[8:33] are actually trembling God I really need
[8:35] your help in this situation or God am I
[8:38] saved or God am I Sanctified God am I
[8:40] filled with the Holy Ghost God am I
[8:42] going to live past this next week
[8:44] right we go from such wonderful moments
[8:46] to such trials so trials that shake us
[8:49] to our very core
[8:51] and so Paul says Paul says in everything
[8:54] be content for this is the will of God
[8:55] in Christ Jesus and everything give
[8:57] thanks for this is God's will
[8:58] there's going to be Mountaintop moments
[9:00] of shouting and dancing and rejoicing
[9:02] and crying out to God then there's going
[9:04] to be moments where you're shaking and
[9:06] you've got to really get down to your
[9:08] core and really say which direction am I
[9:09] going to go
[9:11] right we see it all the time people
[9:12] around the message they hang around but
[9:13] when they leave what happens when they
[9:15] leave when they left they came to a
[9:17] moment where they had to make a final
[9:19] decision on something
[9:21] and they made the wrong decision
[9:23] right because they they lead the word of
[9:26] God
[9:27] but we've got to be the people that when
[9:28] we come down and our lives are shaking
[9:30] us to our very core we choose to believe
[9:32] God's word anyway praise God
[9:34] whatever situation seems like it's
[9:36] falling apart or you question where is
[9:38] God in all this why is God allowed this
[9:40] to happen we got to have the faith to
[9:42] still choose to have hope in Jesus
[9:44] praise God
[9:45] because you're just saying that all your
[9:47] hopes in Jesus
[9:48] amen then we've got to trust his word
[9:50] praise God if all of our hopes in Christ
[9:53] now let's look at verse 20 here this is
[9:55] where we want to start there
[9:58] verse 20 says children obey your parents
[10:00] in all things and the children said
[10:04] Hallelujah all things now of course this
[10:06] refers to all Godly things right just
[10:09] like a wife is so to submit in all
[10:10] things well that doesn't mean sinful
[10:12] things
[10:13] it just means all good things right all
[10:16] things that would be reasonable and
[10:17] correct so we get a plain exhortation
[10:20] from Paul that children ought to obey
[10:23] the parents in all things and this
[10:24] reminded me of the Lord Jesus let's go
[10:26] to Luke chapter 2.
[10:28] you're familiar this this is one of the
[10:30] Just One of the Highlight scriptures for
[10:31] me in the last maybe five or ten years
[10:33] on the Lord Jesus and
[10:34] uh
[10:37] after he says in Luke 2 49 it must be
[10:40] about my father's business
[10:42] verse 51 so Luke 2 51.
[10:46] just some of this some of these powerful
[10:47] thoughts here that we can see
[10:49] and he went down with them and came to
[10:51] Nazareth and was subject unto them but
[10:54] his mother kept all these sayings in her
[10:57] heart
[10:58] so from from the time Jesus was 12
[11:01] to 30 we don't know anything really that
[11:04] he did other than he was a carpenter's
[11:05] son
[11:06] and all he did for those 18 years was
[11:09] just obey mom and dad
[11:11] that's all he did and obeying mom and
[11:13] dad gave him such favor
[11:16] that God blessed him was was such a
[11:19] tremendous life praise God I don't know
[11:21] how to say it but other than it was well
[11:23] pleasing to God Amen
[11:27] and so Jesus Christ live this example he
[11:30] obeyed his parents in all things now I I
[11:32] believe sometimes there was probably
[11:34] times he corrected his mom and dad don't
[11:35] you and his brothers and sisters at
[11:37] least remember he was one of at least
[11:38] seven because they named six they named
[11:41] they named six brothers and sisters and
[11:43] then it just says sisters right
[11:45] so these two sisters could have more
[11:47] sisters than that Four Brothers two
[11:49] sisters and then Jesus so there's at
[11:52] least seven in that family so I imagine
[11:54] Jesus was ever you know each day
[11:56] correcting people
[11:58] I'm sure he did it with a lot of Grace
[11:59] though
[12:00] I'm sure he wasn't driving out his
[12:02] family like you know he was the money
[12:04] changers you know
[12:06] but here where you see this this perfect
[12:07] example of Jesus
[12:10] obeying his parents in all things in
[12:11] verse 52 and Jesus increased in wisdom
[12:14] and stature and in favor with God and
[12:16] man now look at this formula I'm just
[12:18] going to call it a formula
[12:20] children if you obey obey your mom and
[12:22] dad and everything
[12:24] God's going to increase everything in
[12:26] your life
[12:27] God's going to give you more favor
[12:29] right with God
[12:31] in other words God's going to hear more
[12:33] of your prayers
[12:34] everybody listen all those children
[12:36] listen to me
[12:37] God's going to hear more of your prayers
[12:40] and then God's going to give you favor
[12:41] with your friends and your teachers and
[12:43] your pastor and your all the church
[12:45] friends praise God all the adults
[12:48] if you can respect and honor your
[12:51] parents God's going to give you favor
[12:52] everywhere you look
[12:54] Hallelujah
[12:57] what a promise and who's the example
[12:58] Jesus that's just a beautiful thought
[13:01] Jesus is the best example to the husband
[13:04] how to love his wife
[13:06] Jesus is the best example of the wise on
[13:08] how to submit to their husbands because
[13:09] Jesus admit to the father in all things
[13:12] all right so sisters you can still look
[13:14] to Jesus
[13:15] right dads you know husbands we can
[13:17] still look to Jesus and everything
[13:19] look how Jesus treats his church
[13:22] he gave himself for it
[13:24] praise God
[13:25] and so children you can look to Jesus
[13:29] on how you should submit to your parents
[13:32] right submit in All Things become
[13:34] subject to them and then God will give
[13:37] you more favor with God and then more
[13:39] favor with mankind with all the adults
[13:41] too I'll just say like that with God and
[13:43] with the adults
[13:45] beautiful beautiful scripture there of
[13:47] Jesus praise God
[13:49] he learned how to submit
[13:52] you know submission is not an easy thing
[13:55] when you want your way
[13:57] but somebody else wants their way
[14:00] that's when really find out what you're
[14:02] made of praise God right
[14:03] then we see your real colors
[14:06] if you got to grit your teeth and say
[14:08] fine
[14:09] fine
[14:12] or no maybe just maybe it's just a play
[14:14] no
[14:16] or maybe you'll argue just to get your
[14:18] way or maybe like at school they cry to
[14:20] get their own way sometimes
[14:22] those big alligator tears come out okay
[14:28] but here we see an example of
[14:30] Chris of Christ Christ is an example for
[14:34] all of our Christian children
[14:36] to submit and let the Lord have his way
[14:39] right
[14:40] remember the Bible says that in
[14:41] Ephesians
[14:42] the Bible says each one of you be
[14:44] subjects one to another
[14:46] right remember the example brother
[14:47] random gave he said
[14:49] when it came to the Branham Tabernacle
[14:52] he didn't want to have construction and
[14:54] build the brand and have construction on
[14:55] Branham Tabernacle but he looked at all
[14:57] the people and the majority of the
[14:58] people wanted it so he threw his vote in
[15:01] with theirs
[15:03] right so that's just a simple example of
[15:05] one way as an adult you could submit I
[15:08] don't like how the money's being used or
[15:09] I don't like how this I don't like how
[15:11] that well look sometimes look to other
[15:13] people praise God
[15:15] sometimes don't look to be the unless
[15:17] you're standing on God's word that's
[15:18] different but if it's just your opinion
[15:20] and it's just like a Christian Area
[15:21] Christian Liberty let's throw our
[15:23] opinion in with others praise God if
[15:25] it's not going to hurt anything amen I
[15:27] think that's a good example
[15:28] a brother ran there I don't really want
[15:30] to do the construction but then he does
[15:32] it and then and look later look later
[15:33] when he preaches Seven Seals he was glad
[15:35] because the church was larger everything
[15:37] was better The Acoustics were better
[15:39] everything worked out better over a
[15:40] hundred people were baptizing that week
[15:43] praise God
[15:46] so that's a great example of just
[15:47] throwing your opinion in you know just
[15:49] submitting to other people and then God
[15:51] works everything out for his glory
[15:54] Hallelujah
[15:56] so children let's hope let's learn to
[15:58] obey the parents in all things
[16:01] a good thing to memorize parents is yes
[16:03] Mom that's a good thing to memorize
[16:05] let that be quick to come out of your
[16:06] mouth yes ma'am
[16:08] or yes Dad right
[16:11] don't complain don't talk back don't ask
[16:13] questions let's all hear the children
[16:14] say yes Mom can you know all the
[16:16] children say that
[16:17] oh that's good that's right now let's
[16:19] hear yes Dad ready
[16:20] oh you guys are doing good praise God I
[16:22] just keep saying though the rest of the
[16:23] night praise God
[16:24] take it home with you do tomorrow too
[16:27] yes Dad yes ma'am
[16:30] because that's the way to please God
[16:33] submit to the ones who have authority
[16:35] over you now that's the way to get with
[16:37] favor favor with God now and later
[16:41] amen
[16:44] so children take let's take a lesson
[16:46] from the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:48] fathers Colossians 3 21 fathers provoke
[16:51] not your children to anger lest they be
[16:54] discouraged
[16:57] now let me look up some let me look at
[16:59] these Greek words here by God's grace so
[17:00] provoke means to stir up
[17:03] to stimulate to provoke or to excite of
[17:06] course this is in the not the good way
[17:08] like hey do you want to go get ice cream
[17:10] it's a different excitement than that
[17:12] this is the the bad excitement
[17:15] right so fathers don't provoke your
[17:17] children making them angry
[17:20] lest they be discouraged
[17:24] so discourage is the word broken in
[17:26] spirit
[17:27] disheartened
[17:30] now at church I don't know if I've ever
[17:31] been broken in spirit
[17:33] but I know a lot of people have
[17:36] they've just felt what I mean is
[17:37] hopeless
[17:39] they're hopeless and so Paul wrote to
[17:42] the fathers especially now don't let me
[17:43] wrong mothers can do that too mothers
[17:45] can make have the wrong Spirit on them
[17:46] and they could break a child's spirit
[17:47] and just make them feel hopeless but
[17:49] specifically God anoints Paul to tell
[17:51] that fathers
[17:54] don't provoke your children unless they
[17:56] be broken spirited
[18:00] so Dads Dads have a special assignment
[18:02] from God you need to encourage your
[18:04] children
[18:07] you need to build up your children and
[18:09] don't make fun of them
[18:11] or don't mock them or don't look down
[18:13] upon them don't break their spirits
[18:17] right
[18:18] like I was glad I got to tell malachite
[18:20] I'm proud of you son you got your
[18:21] license proud of you
[18:23] I don't tell you that enough man okay
[18:24] I'm proud of you Lydia I don't tell you
[18:26] that enough Casey I got to go through
[18:28] all
[18:29] Haven I don't tell you that enough Karis
[18:31] I don't tell you that enough I'm proud
[18:32] of you Victoria I'm proud of you
[18:33] Genevieve Mountain proudly where's Zion
[18:35] I'm sleep I'm proud of how Zion sleeps
[18:38] I'm proud of him too with everything he
[18:40] does too
[18:42] but one element especially dads need to
[18:44] do is not something it just it just
[18:47] gives the impression dads are are less
[18:49] loving right the is it's harder for dads
[18:51] to express love
[18:54] nobody's got to say Amen because we know
[18:55] it's all true right
[18:57] it's harder for dads to be loving
[19:00] and so dad's got to learn am I the only
[19:02] Dad here tonight I'm the only Dad here
[19:04] tonight
[19:05] I'm preaching to myself praise God all
[19:08] right Dad come on be loving praise God
[19:11] so I've got to find a way to encourage
[19:13] my children
[19:15] amen
[19:16] I gotta find a way uh to excite them in
[19:19] good ways and not excite them in bad
[19:21] ways
[19:23] now if they need a little correction
[19:24] then I'm just the one to do that praise
[19:26] God I want to be by God's grace
[19:28] mom too but
[19:30] so fathers need to take a lesson now
[19:32] remember the one or the one father that
[19:35] stood out to me out of all the fathers I
[19:37] preached on that as I was thinking about
[19:39] this was Eli
[19:42] the one father of an example let's not
[19:44] be like Eli right
[19:45] and Eli the Bible said he restrained not
[19:49] his sons from their sins
[19:52] so Eli had it in his power he could have
[19:55] removed his two sons from being priests
[19:57] but he didn't do it
[20:00] he let the the sons keep sinning he let
[20:03] the sons lead the people into sinning
[20:07] right you let them be lewd men
[20:10] and so this is another father's here
[20:12] I'll probably preach shorter on this
[20:13] section but it's my job as a dad it's
[20:15] the the jobs of the fathers to restrain
[20:19] their children of course moms do this
[20:20] too but this one case where the Bible
[20:22] speaking of father so I'll just focus on
[20:23] the fathers
[20:24] the fathers when they see their children
[20:26] getting on the line they've got to make
[20:28] a change
[20:30] how many times have I heard different
[20:32] preachers and different ones say as soon
[20:34] as I get home I'm going to make that
[20:35] change
[20:36] you know maybe the preachers are
[20:38] traveling or something and I hear them
[20:39] say as soon as I get home we're gonna
[20:41] make a change with my children I'm gonna
[20:42] make a change to the church there
[20:45] no really you know Dads Dads should be
[20:49] causing uh should be causing positive
[20:51] feelings right and yes dads have the
[20:54] power to change things most things right
[20:58] but they got to have the power to change
[20:59] to bring encouragement to the children
[21:02] praise God and I hope as a spiritual you
[21:05] know as a spiritual leader of the church
[21:06] I hope I'm bringing encouragement to
[21:08] each one of you by God's grace that's my
[21:10] prayer amen
[21:12] you know it's a delicate balance I mean
[21:14] I gotta I'm called to rebuke sin
[21:16] right I gotta rebuke sin
[21:19] uh but I I can't have a personal uh a
[21:22] personal problem against somebody like I
[21:24] can't I'm not supposed to isolate people
[21:26] right if I the Bible says if you've got
[21:29] to promise somebody go talk to them
[21:30] one-on-one
[21:32] and I Try by God's grace not to bring it
[21:34] up across the pulpit now people that
[21:35] don't come here anymore yeah I'll preach
[21:37] at them right across the pulpit because
[21:39] they're not here anymore and I want you
[21:41] to learn from their mistakes didn't
[21:43] Jesus say remember Lot's wife praise God
[21:46] amen here's an example of someone who
[21:48] wasn't there
[21:51] and so it's a great balance you know
[21:53] we've got to encourage our children and
[21:56] not break their spirits but mend their
[21:58] Broken Spirits
[22:00] right in their failures we got to say
[22:02] that's okay try again
[22:04] everybody fails daddy fails
[22:07] seems like I'm pretty good at coming up
[22:09] of examples of my failure so
[22:11] hopefully my children know that you know
[22:13] I I try to
[22:15] yeah I've had different talks with
[22:16] Malachi and Lydia and Acacia in the past
[22:18] and I've tried to share well you know
[22:20] here's what I did you know this was a
[22:23] really ashamed of this now compare what
[22:25] you did to what I did
[22:27] you can learn from my mistake too you
[22:29] know
[22:30] and then also Church you know you know
[22:32] Annoying all my mistakes it gives me
[22:34] wisdom on how to treat my children
[22:36] you know
[22:37] because I know how I was treated
[22:40] and uh and then I can show Grace now let
[22:43] me just give my mom a few props here you
[22:45] know
[22:46] I always give my mom a few props
[22:49] you know I was in I was in a car
[22:50] accident in high school I hit somebody
[22:52] rear-ended somebody you know
[22:54] my mom never got mad at me
[22:56] you know uh
[22:59] had to go stand before the judge
[23:01] I started talking the judge cut me off I
[23:04] was like well I was just tired you can't
[23:06] even get in the car if you're tired I
[23:08] can still I still got the uh I'm so
[23:11] provoked from that actually from all
[23:12] those years later
[23:13] I'm so discouraged from that maybe
[23:15] that's why I got my speeding ticket last
[23:17] week you know
[23:19] but uh you know I just you know I take
[23:20] that from my mom you know she would she
[23:22] would tell me when I was wrong but then
[23:23] she would just go on move on
[23:26] and so I've tried it you know I've taken
[23:28] that into my own parenting you know make
[23:30] a mistake we've got to talk about it
[23:31] then we just move on
[23:33] now of course there's different levels
[23:34] of mistakes
[23:37] and the worst the mistake the harsher
[23:40] the punishment
[23:41] but I do appreciate my mom for that you
[23:43] know I can't think of you know maybe
[23:46] that's the first example I thought of
[23:47] just I was expecting I was expecting
[23:49] anger but I got Grace
[23:52] she still paid my insurance you know she
[23:54] still did all that a single mom
[23:57] and so in my mother in my mom parented
[24:00] me I saw a lot of Grace
[24:03] so that's a word to the fathers there
[24:05] after the word to the children
[24:08] you know I want to look up another
[24:09] scripture here I go to Proverbs here if
[24:11] you would here
[24:12] this one has come into my mind here
[24:16] yes Proverbs 29 21 please
[24:19] remember I preached that Proverbs here
[24:21] that was the first year brother William
[24:22] came and
[24:23] I hardly use any program quotes and he's
[24:25] like do you even are you a message
[24:26] preacher you know are you leaving
[24:27] Brother Brad yes brother yes I'm just
[24:30] doing a little teaching series here
[24:32] straight through the Bible
[24:34] well I like that I like to know that I
[24:36] don't have to say brother and brother
[24:37] and brother and brother and brother
[24:38] random brother
[24:40] you know I like that I can say the Bible
[24:41] says the Bible says Jesus said Jesus
[24:43] said Jesus said I like that I can have a
[24:45] variety of messages there but that was a
[24:47] good question for our brother to ask
[24:48] there
[24:49] Proverbs 29 21 now look at this he that
[24:52] delicately bringeth up his servant from
[24:54] a child shall haven't become a son at
[24:57] the length now think of Abraham and
[24:59] Eliezer
[25:02] Abraham had no Sons
[25:04] right and then once he got a son his
[25:07] next trusted person was Eliezer he sends
[25:10] Eliezer across the country to get a wife
[25:14] I don't know about you but who would you
[25:15] send to get a wife or husband for your
[25:17] child
[25:19] oh
[25:22] who here would I send to get a husband
[25:24] for Lydia
[25:30] I'll go myself
[25:31] [Laughter]
[25:34] no but you know look look at the
[25:36] confidence that he had in uh in Ellie
[25:39] easer a lot of confidence
[25:41] and here we get this idea here
[25:43] you know
[25:44] as as parents we got to be delicate with
[25:47] our children
[25:49] right we don't want to be harsh harsh
[25:50] harsh harsh harsh
[25:53] there are times to be harsh
[25:55] and there's different cultures right
[25:58] but we see here now this word now this
[26:01] word I actually maybe wouldn't use from
[26:02] the pulpit but it actually means to
[26:04] pamper
[26:06] it just means to bring up or treat
[26:08] though I like the word treat delicately
[26:09] I like that word delicate in other words
[26:11] church we want to be real careful how we
[26:13] respond to our children
[26:15] and then church we're all going to make
[26:16] mistakes so being a delicate parent is
[26:19] being able to say I'm sorry if I made a
[26:21] mistake
[26:23] that's one thing I hope my parents or my
[26:24] children see in me that I'm not perfect
[26:27] I make mistakes I want them to know I'm
[26:29] sorry when I make a mistake
[26:31] I didn't mean to do that
[26:34] in other words I want to make sure I say
[26:36] the right thing at the right time
[26:37] remember last Wednesday when I preached
[26:38] anyone remember last Wednesday when I
[26:39] preaching
[26:42] what
[26:47] remember the title
[26:49] spiritual yeah spiritual food give it to
[26:51] your class
[26:53] so that's what that's what we really
[26:55] want is parents
[26:56] I want to be able to say the right thing
[26:58] at the right time to Lydia or Malachi or
[27:00] Keisha or whoever needs it
[27:02] boy do I need God's help because a lot
[27:04] of times I don't feel like I don't have
[27:05] the right words to say
[27:11] you know the Bible says raise them up
[27:12] delicately or with a lot of wisdom in
[27:15] other words right
[27:17] so how do we get that well we got to
[27:18] pray for right the Bible said if you
[27:20] need Wisdom ask for it God will give it
[27:21] liberally praise God
[27:25] so just a beautiful it's a beautiful
[27:26] thing like you know a servant wouldn't
[27:28] be anything close as special as a family
[27:30] member but if you train up a servant and
[27:32] treat them like a child pretty soon they
[27:34] could they could take over as a child if
[27:37] you didn't have any children
[27:38] that's just a great thought there
[27:41] it's the idea in other words I'll say
[27:43] like this it's the idea of just being a
[27:45] well
[27:46] a well-trained parent right
[27:49] or a very concerned parent that's the
[27:51] idea
[27:53] like I I get scared when you know when
[27:55] I've seen people that won't read a book
[27:56] about having a better marriage I get
[27:57] nervous about that
[28:00] you mean you're going to spend all these
[28:01] years of 18 years at least as a parent
[28:03] and you're not going to even try to
[28:04] become better
[28:06] you're just going to go with the flow
[28:09] how's that going to work out you for you
[28:10] in any other occupation
[28:14] maybe I could take Austin's place
[28:15] tomorrow night at his job and let's see
[28:17] if I can just go with the flow and see
[28:18] if I can be the supervisor there
[28:20] and just run all the plates out and
[28:22] everything and see if I
[28:23] no you got to go through training
[28:26] what'd you do we could train him about
[28:27] two weeks what'd you do
[28:32] yeah so yeah so you had somebody there
[28:33] yeah but you still had training yeah
[28:36] yeah a month yeah a month
[28:39] and so you know I'm concerned like like
[28:41] I'm glad we're doing uh marriage
[28:43] counseling you know and that's how I
[28:45] tell the people I'm not going to marry
[28:46] unless I counsel you
[28:47] because I got to know that you've heard
[28:48] the truth
[28:50] you're accountable for it praise God
[28:53] you just don't walk into marriage
[28:55] oh it's all going to work out
[28:57] that's that's a really bad attitude I
[29:00] mean yeah I mean by God's grace but you
[29:02] can do something about it praise God
[29:05] and as a parent we can do something
[29:07] about it
[29:09] we can become a better parent so my next
[29:10] book I'm going to write is on parenting
[29:12] I got one chapter written but I kind of
[29:14] took a break
[29:15] I want to kind of get this next series
[29:17] done and I want to start writing on that
[29:19] by God's grace
[29:21] I go to Proverbs 15 1. this is what I
[29:24] taught at the middle school on Tuesday
[29:27] morning
[29:30] we were talking about you know how do
[29:32] you deal with problems in the middle
[29:33] school and this is a very familiar
[29:35] scripture but
[29:37] another good good reminder
[29:39] you know when voices raise when voices
[29:41] raised and I found this with some
[29:42] students I actually had to do this today
[29:44] I'm on the playground with some students
[29:46] I have to raise my voice other students
[29:48] I don't have to raise my voice
[29:50] so today unfortunately on the playground
[29:52] I had to raise my voice this boy was in
[29:54] my class last year and he just he
[29:55] wouldn't let it go and I finally said
[29:57] Michael
[29:58] and he's like okay I was like Michael
[30:01] say you're sorry sorry then he walks
[30:04] away I pleaded with him a couple times
[30:06] Michael so you're sorry Michael and
[30:08] finally I'm like Michael say you're
[30:10] sorry
[30:11] I tried the soft answer approach that
[30:13] didn't work now him his dad was in jail
[30:15] maybe that's why I had to raise my voice
[30:17] like that
[30:18] dad was in jail for a number of years
[30:20] but the Bible said a soft answer turns
[30:22] away wrath but Grievous words stir up
[30:25] anger
[30:27] now the Grievous means sorrowful or
[30:30] offensive words right painful hurting
[30:35] words
[30:36] so see we can say things loud and as
[30:38] long as they're not personal that's okay
[30:40] like I didn't say anything against
[30:41] Michael about his personal being today I
[30:44] just said you need to say sorry
[30:47] there was no wrath in it I wasn't I had
[30:50] nothing against the boy that's how we
[30:52] should be with our families right
[30:54] we shouldn't attack them personally we
[30:56] should attack their looks we shouldn't
[30:58] attack their intelligence right Church
[31:02] we shouldn't attack them personally
[31:05] right we ought to edify the family right
[31:07] we need to edify the family build the
[31:09] family up praise God
[31:12] praise him up
[31:14] but there has been so many times in my
[31:16] class somebody's young I'll just use
[31:17] another name well maybe I shouldn't use
[31:19] that name
[31:22] uh
[31:24] Martin I'll use Martin instead Martin
[31:27] Martin will raise his voice Mr Smith
[31:30] I'll say Martin
[31:33] it's almost like I'm there right now
[31:34] flashbacks
[31:36] post-traumatic stress syndrome oh my God
[31:42] and then he finally does
[31:47] and tell you to do that I didn't tell
[31:48] you to go there
[31:49] he's raising his voice but I'm bringing
[31:51] mine down
[31:53] and then he writes me pictures and says
[31:55] he loves me like he's the one that
[31:56] breaks the rules all the time Martin
[31:57] but then he's one of the writes on these
[31:58] pictures like he loves me
[32:00] because that is proof when you when you
[32:02] crack somebody that's proof you love
[32:03] them
[32:05] right love is corrective right we know
[32:08] that
[32:09] but not to stir up
[32:10] a personal battle against him or a
[32:12] personal attack not to bring them pain
[32:14] but just to bring them correction with
[32:15] love
[32:17] okay
[32:21] all right so we get some different ideas
[32:22] there on parenting for fathers and
[32:24] mothers
[32:25] um
[32:27] you know build them up right as fathers
[32:29] we don't want to discourage we want to
[32:30] encourage and let me say this too you
[32:32] know I was uh listening to a servant
[32:35] and they were just encouraging fathers
[32:37] fathers you know we've got to give your
[32:39] kids hugs
[32:40] right you got to tell them you love them
[32:42] oh yeah in fact we had brother Arley
[32:44] stay
[32:45] yeah let me share this yeah yeah brother
[32:47] Ali stay on
[32:49] Saturday night and he told me Sunday
[32:51] before I left he said thanks brother for
[32:52] letting me stay and he bought us an
[32:54] avocado he bought us some blackberries
[32:56] and he bought us some fish too just to
[32:58] say thanks for letting us let them stand
[33:00] like all right you have to do that he's
[33:02] a very sweet man
[33:03] but as we're leaving out there it's
[33:05] pouring down the rain you know I got the
[33:06] umbrellas out there he's like I just
[33:08] want to tell you I love you he said he
[33:09] said thanks for having me and he said I
[33:11] loved how you did your family bible time
[33:13] at night
[33:15] of course we do pray we do we read from
[33:18] the scripture or from my book because
[33:20] it's about the scripture
[33:21] ask questions and then we'll sing and
[33:23] then we pray and then we always give
[33:25] hugs and kisses good night
[33:27] and he said I especially loved how you
[33:28] did hugs and kisses he said in the Amish
[33:30] community we don't touch kids after
[33:32] they're four or five years old and my
[33:34] heart about saying
[33:36] imagine you're six years old my first
[33:39] graders are six and seven and they give
[33:40] me hugs all the time
[33:42] like there's one girl in my class I'll
[33:44] just call her Jennifer that's her name
[33:45] but she every day she's I check their
[33:48] spelling every morning I make them do
[33:49] their spelling words and handwriting and
[33:51] she'll just lean on me the whole time
[33:52] while she's waiting for me to grade it
[33:53] and I'm like thanks Jennifer
[34:00] some kids just need love
[34:02] like and Jennifer comes from a Muslim
[34:04] family where they probably don't get a
[34:05] lot of love
[34:06] unfortunately
[34:09] um but he said I really love that in the
[34:11] Amish community nobody's giving out hugs
[34:14] I think man
[34:15] well no wonder some of these guys going
[34:17] to go sow their wild seeds you know or
[34:19] whatever it's Wild Oats whatever they
[34:20] say
[34:21] no wonder they want to run away from
[34:23] home there's no love there and they come
[34:24] to church and it's all it's all legalism
[34:26] and dogmatic and there's no inspiration
[34:29] there's no love
[34:34] and church I'm not perfect at loving my
[34:35] children I'm not saying that but what
[34:36] I'm saying is that the love of Christ
[34:38] makes you want to love your children
[34:41] praise God
[34:44] so fathers and mothers hope those are a
[34:46] few words of encouragement tonight by
[34:47] God's grace
[34:48] Hallelujah verse 22 let's move on here
[34:51] servants obey in all things your Masters
[34:53] according to the flesh
[34:55] not with eye service
[34:58] that means service performed only under
[35:01] the Master's eye you only work hard when
[35:04] they're watching you
[35:07] everybody said now the thing about your
[35:10] sir your boss
[35:12] as men Pleasers right we don't want to
[35:14] be we don't want to be trying to get
[35:16] favor with men so the Bible says when we
[35:19] only work hard around our boss we're
[35:21] only trying to get favor with men so the
[35:24] opposite's true if we work hard without
[35:26] the boss we're trying to get favor with
[35:27] God
[35:30] trying to gain God's favor
[35:32] and it all goes back to this idea
[35:35] the real person you are is when you're
[35:38] all alone that's the real person you are
[35:40] and nobody's watching
[35:43] right that's why I love the Scripture it
[35:46] just shows it shows who really loves God
[35:48] right and I I think church we can all
[35:51] say I need to love God more how many
[35:53] could say that Amen to that yeah we all
[35:54] need to love God more but we really see
[35:57] who we are when we're all alone
[36:00] nobody watching us nobody checking up on
[36:03] us
[36:03] just us
[36:05] and the Holy Spirit
[36:07] Hallelujah
[36:10] so the Bible says obeyed all things even
[36:13] when no one's even when the Master's not
[36:14] watching with a singleness or a
[36:17] sincerity or an honesty of heart that's
[36:20] what that singleness of heart and
[36:22] honesty of heart
[36:23] because you again you fear God remember
[36:25] we looked at fear fear of God on Sunday
[36:26] a little bit
[36:28] just have this extreme uh adoration for
[36:32] God
[36:32] an extreme honor for God that's why you
[36:35] work hard for your boss
[36:38] now I've said it here when I'm at work I
[36:40] work as hard as I possibly can
[36:42] by God's grace
[36:44] but I don't go at home I don't go above
[36:46] and beyond it because I don't really
[36:47] have to I could but I'm not gonna I
[36:50] don't want to take away from my family
[36:51] my time with my family or my time with
[36:54] God
[36:55] all right so I just try to do all my
[36:57] work at school although great in there I
[36:59] just try to get everything done there
[37:01] so I can be free and don't have to worry
[37:04] about the problems every now and then I
[37:05] got you know things I got to do at home
[37:08] but I have to remember the Lord is there
[37:10] with me on the job as well church and
[37:12] the Lord's with you on your job as well
[37:17] diver tell you I go Joe
[37:19] when I worked at Gojo for that summer
[37:21] before I got my teaching job did I ever
[37:22] tell you
[37:23] I was with a new crew so what does the
[37:25] new crew do Emma the new crew goes to
[37:27] the uh the pallets and they got all
[37:30] these boxes of soap
[37:33] and they're just busted and broken
[37:37] and the when you're on the new when
[37:38] you're the new guy you got to go there
[37:40] and lift the boxes for eight hours you
[37:42] got to look through and see if there's
[37:43] leakers we're looking for leakers
[37:46] and you can see the blue soap the purple
[37:48] soap and you would throw all the leaker
[37:50] boxes on another pallet and got a stack
[37:52] them real neat
[37:54] right
[37:55] and all the good ones that aren't leaked
[37:57] oh it's a good box so I'm gonna take it
[37:59] over here I'm gonna put it on that
[37:59] palette so for eight hours
[38:03] I had to pick up the boxes look them
[38:07] eight hours
[38:08] now most of the new guys that get around
[38:10] there they start laughing and talking I
[38:12] just keep working
[38:14] and church I don't know how many times I
[38:16] look around the corner and the the boss
[38:18] the boss the supervisor would be peeking
[38:21] around the corner like this
[38:27] and each time I'm like thank God I'm
[38:28] working praise God
[38:30] all these people are taking breaks like
[38:32] it's so hard it's not really hard it's
[38:35] just monotonous and boring
[38:37] but by the end of that summer I only
[38:39] worked there uh May June July and August
[38:42] and by the fourth month I'd already got
[38:44] the the Tow Motor job and you weren't
[38:46] supposed to get that for like until you
[38:47] were hired in full time
[38:50] but because I just worked all the time
[38:51] without them I mean they were watching
[38:54] me but I've worked like they weren't
[38:55] watching me right I worked that they
[38:58] they uh what they call They promoted me
[39:00] early before I even had uh the status
[39:03] they let me they broke the rules to
[39:05] promote me
[39:07] that's a good example I could probably
[39:08] give you some bad examples from when I
[39:10] was a sinner by God's grace
[39:12] so when I was a sinner we worked in a
[39:14] landscaping crew and we would skip out
[39:15] on work for the afternoon and go watch a
[39:16] bad movie you know at the movie theater
[39:18] that's a bad example don't ever do that
[39:20] everybody does learn from my mistake
[39:22] don't do that but I was a sinner I never
[39:25] did that as a Christian praise God
[39:29] so we got to have the fear of God and
[39:30] church remember that God's watching us
[39:32] everywhere
[39:33] he's watching us everywhere
[39:35] and then verse 23 Colossians 3 23
[39:37] whatsoever you do so it doesn't matter
[39:39] whether you're a teacher whether you're
[39:40] a student whatever you are do it
[39:43] heartily as to the Lord and not to men
[39:46] that hardly means with your your
[39:48] feelings your desires your affections
[39:53] I just had my uh superintendent tell me
[39:55] a couple weeks ago he's like every time
[39:57] I look at you you're always smiling Mr
[39:58] Smith
[39:59] it's like I got a lot to be thankful for
[40:01] praise God
[40:02] but people can see the heart for God
[40:04] right when you go to work or you
[40:06] wherever you wherever wherever you
[40:08] associate people will see your heart for
[40:10] God on your face
[40:11] right and and through your work ethic
[40:13] praise God
[40:15] so whatever you do put your heart and
[40:18] your emotions into it as to the Lord and
[40:21] not to men
[40:23] so Church there's a way you can work on
[40:25] the computer and do it for God
[40:27] right
[40:29] there's a way you can uh you can sort
[40:32] leaking boxes of soap and do it for
[40:35] God's glory
[40:36] see you can sing the whole time amen
[40:38] hallelujah you can think about the
[40:40] scriptures
[40:42] there's a way to honor God and work for
[40:46] God no matter what situation you're in
[40:47] or else Paul would not have said
[40:48] whatever you do do it for God
[40:51] praise God
[40:53] Hallelujah
[40:54] why because verse 24 tells us why
[40:56] knowing that of the Lord you shall
[40:58] receive the reward of the inheritance
[41:01] look you get a reward whatever you do
[41:04] you're going to get a reward
[41:06] isn't that something
[41:08] you can get a reward no matter what job
[41:10] you is you say brother brother Jesse my
[41:12] job is meaningless Jesus said you're
[41:14] going to get a reward
[41:15] how you work at your job
[41:17] you get a reward
[41:21] for you serve who who do you serve
[41:24] the Lord Christ and that's something you
[41:26] didn't say Lord Jesus Christ he just
[41:28] says Lord Christ
[41:30] that's the Lord
[41:32] and of course Christ is Messiah the
[41:33] anointed
[41:35] all right you serve the Lord Christ
[41:39] God
[41:41] so whatever you do put your heart into
[41:43] it
[41:45] you know like that you know Malachi and
[41:47] Lydia over there at that job and the
[41:49] bosses come and they tell me what a what
[41:51] a wonderful group of of workers they are
[41:55] and they said you got some more kids
[41:56] right they're all going to come work for
[41:58] us right
[41:59] I said oh yeah but you better raise the
[42:01] pain I didn't say that
[42:03] so you better raise him no I never said
[42:05] that
[42:06] if the price is right they'll come
[42:12] no but people see if you're putting your
[42:14] heart into your work or you're not
[42:15] putting your heart into your work
[42:18] so we want to be Christians that people
[42:19] can say oh I'm putting my putting my
[42:21] heart into this
[42:22] like we just had a Taekwondo Testament
[42:24] what the guy said about me he said I
[42:26] always learn something from your reports
[42:28] remember he said that Mr harion
[42:31] you know honestly I don't even really
[42:32] like doing reports for Taekwondo but I
[42:35] put I work on it like I'm working for
[42:37] the Lord
[42:39] now in that case there's a little bit of
[42:40] procrastination but I still get it done
[42:42] on time
[42:45] and he says he learns something new
[42:46] every time there's something I don't
[42:47] really enjoy but I work on it really
[42:49] hard I take the suggestions I do the
[42:51] best I can
[42:53] I try to get I try to get better at it
[42:56] so whatever you do put your heart into
[42:58] it as into the Lord
[43:00] because Church you shall receive award
[43:02] how many looking forward to the rewards
[43:03] praise God I'm looking forward to the
[43:05] rewards the greatest reward will be
[43:06] seeing Jesus Christ
[43:07] but after that the Bible says you do
[43:09] receive the reward of the inheritance
[43:13] there is a reward for being faithful
[43:16] remember if you're faithful with five
[43:18] talents you get 10 cities
[43:20] move over 10 cities
[43:22] praise God
[43:24] if you got two talents maybe you rule
[43:26] over four cities
[43:28] oh it's a blessing
[43:30] it's a blessing
[43:32] verse 25 finish in this chapter verse
[43:34] chapter 3.
[43:35] verse 25 but he that doeth wrong shall
[43:38] receive for the wrong which he hath done
[43:40] and there's no respect to persons I like
[43:43] this verse you know why you know why I
[43:45] like this verse because it basically
[43:46] puts you in two camps now this is this
[43:48] is awesome you're either doing right or
[43:50] wrong and the church said
[43:52] that ought to make somebody happy here
[43:53] tonight praise God now your degree of
[43:56] right God will judge that but really
[43:58] when it all boils down to it you're
[44:00] either doing right or wrong let's do
[44:01] what's right praise God
[44:03] serving Jesus right I'm loving Jesus I'm
[44:05] trying to forgive I'm trying to as a
[44:08] parent I'm trying to build up my
[44:09] children I'm trying to do all these
[44:10] things trying to love my husband love my
[44:11] wife whatever situation you're in do the
[44:13] good thing praise God
[44:16] do what's right do what's good let's not
[44:18] do what's wrong praise God let's fix the
[44:21] wrong as soon as we can praise God let's
[44:24] make it right Hallelujah
[44:26] that's why I like that verse because
[44:28] we're not told all the details about
[44:30] Rewards
[44:32] right we think we'll get them at the
[44:34] marriage supper of the Lamb right after
[44:35] the
[44:36] um right after you know the communion
[44:37] with Jesus and the uh where he he drinks
[44:40] of the Vine afresh with us
[44:43] we're not told all the details
[44:46] but we want to make sure we do what's
[44:49] right
[44:50] because we're going to have to we're
[44:52] going to reap what we're going to reap
[44:53] what we sow right
[44:55] and there's no respect to person with
[44:56] God think about that God's going to
[44:57] treat each one of us exactly the same
[45:00] exactly the same
[45:03] I remember we read that chapter uh
[45:05] in my book at home
[45:08] and it's one of the it's the parable of
[45:10] the pounds
[45:11] I think in the parable of the pounds
[45:12] everybody had the same amount of money
[45:15] well how what does that show that shows
[45:18] everybody is given a certain amount of
[45:20] opportunities in life
[45:22] right what do we all what do we all have
[45:24] that's the same we have a life
[45:28] so you and I we all have the same
[45:30] opportunities
[45:31] to glorify God with our life
[45:34] everybody here has a chance to pray in
[45:36] the morning
[45:37] and to pray at night I'm not going to
[45:39] leave that out
[45:41] everybody here has a Bible is that right
[45:43] amen
[45:45] I can read their Bible
[45:47] everybody has here somebody that they
[45:49] live with right so everybody has a a
[45:52] person at their home that they can show
[45:53] the love of Christ to and serve is that
[45:55] true yeah good nature and nature saying
[45:57] amen hallelujah
[46:00] see those are all equal we all have
[46:02] money right except for the real little
[46:04] ones
[46:05] all right we'll have money so we all
[46:06] have that equal opportunity we've all
[46:08] got money we've all got these all these
[46:10] are the same
[46:12] without it and we have to ask God Lord
[46:14] help me do what's right with all these
[46:16] things you've given to me that's the
[46:17] same
[46:20] we can all speak English some of us
[46:22] better than others right
[46:24] like not like me you mix words up and
[46:27] spit and stutter and all kinds of things
[46:29] like that
[46:31] making fun of myself is what I'm making
[46:33] fun of
[46:35] but we all have a chance to talk about
[46:36] Jesus
[46:38] how many people here can sing
[46:41] everybody can see we all have a chance
[46:43] to sing every day
[46:46] right
[46:47] who who here can't see
[46:49] who here can't live who here cannot lift
[46:52] their hands
[46:53] and praise God every day
[46:56] everybody can do that
[46:58] praise God
[47:00] we have a lot of things that are the
[47:02] same
[47:03] right and God's given us all the same
[47:06] opportunity let's make the most of it
[47:08] praise God
[47:10] Hallelujah there's no respect to persons
[47:12] with God everybody will be judges the
[47:14] same
[47:15] that's why diligence is such a great
[47:17] topic that's why I love diligence
[47:19] we can't earn salvation but after we get
[47:21] salvation
[47:22] then it's now it's diligence right
[47:25] now diligence
[47:28] every man the Bible said every man
[47:30] according to his labors
[47:33] Hallelujah
[47:34] we're all saved by grace
[47:36] God will never lose salvation we'll
[47:38] never lose the baptism Holy Ghost no
[47:40] God's never against us but after that we
[47:42] got free more agency
[47:45] and now we all have these same
[47:46] opportunities how many want to make the
[47:48] most of the opportunities praise God
[47:49] that's why you're in church tonight amen
[47:52] and God will bless you let me let me
[47:53] grow a few more verses on I kind of know
[47:55] where I want to end here
[47:57] let me set a little time right here
[47:59] all right chapter four
[48:02] that's a meaty scripture right there
[48:04] church
[48:05] whatever you do do it heartily
[48:08] as to the Lord knowing you get a reward
[48:11] of inheritance
[48:13] praise God
[48:17] with all your heart
[48:20] and I'm and I know church we all get
[48:22] tired I make I make fun of myself all
[48:24] the time I get tired there's things I
[48:26] don't want to do sometimes but that's
[48:28] why we're gathered here like this so we
[48:29] can we can have transform Minds
[48:32] so tomorrow we don't have to be too
[48:34] tired
[48:35] it really just doesn't keep us too long
[48:38] like last week
[48:39] well actually that was all your
[48:40] testimonies last week so
[48:42] it was all of our testimonies last week
[48:45] I should say we all kept ourselves up a
[48:47] little later last night but that was
[48:48] perfect that was beautiful beautiful
[48:49] time in the Lord
[48:51] Colossians 4 verse 1 Masters now okay
[48:54] now he dresses the master so he went
[48:55] from wives
[48:58] fathers children
[49:01] servants and now he goes into Masters
[49:04] now remember remember we preached on
[49:05] slavery and everything this is kind of
[49:07] like an indentured servant in the Roman
[49:08] system
[49:09] the leader of the house had life and
[49:11] death power over everybody the husband
[49:13] could have anybody killed
[49:16] and so Paul does Paul ever say you know
[49:18] if you're if if your wife mistreats her
[49:21] take her out does Paul ever say that
[49:23] you know if you're if your child doesn't
[49:25] obeying you get rid of them does Paul
[49:26] ever say that no
[49:28] he says he said don't discourage that
[49:30] in other words love them
[49:33] all right so Paul says Jesus Christ
[49:35] changes the total Dynamic of the home
[49:38] Hallelujah that's what I love I love how
[49:41] Arley can walk into my home and he knows
[49:42] it's a Christian Home praise God
[49:44] he was never there one time but he come
[49:47] one time and he says this house is
[49:49] different praise God then think about
[49:51] that then all the other Amish houses
[49:52] praise God think about that
[49:55] he's in his 50s
[49:57] and he steps in one message believer's
[49:59] home where they love Jesus Christ they
[50:01] love one another he said this is
[50:02] different than all the other average
[50:03] houses I've been in that's something
[50:05] Church
[50:06] that shocks me right now I wasn't even
[50:08] planning to say that that just shocks me
[50:09] now
[50:10] that Jesus Christ changes the dynamic
[50:12] completely praise God
[50:17] right the same thing's true for America
[50:18] I'm sure if you walk into most American
[50:20] Homes you'd see some things that we'd be
[50:22] shocked and embarrassed and wouldn't
[50:24] mention but then if they'd walk into our
[50:26] homes they'd see a different home too
[50:29] that's what first convinced me the
[50:30] message was right after the scriptures
[50:32] was I saw how David Llewellyn Craig
[50:34] Brewer Freddie boor and Dan boor all
[50:37] those guys live so holy as single men
[50:41] that were just a couple years older than
[50:42] me I was so shocked and like you guys
[50:44] don't have like Michael Jordan on your
[50:47] wall
[50:47] you don't have like swimsuit models on
[50:50] your wall they got pictures of Jesus on
[50:52] the wall they got the Hoffman head on
[50:54] their wall they got that picture of that
[50:56] woman who's he she's at her table
[50:58] praying she got her glasses off and
[51:00] she's got Bread on her plate and she's
[51:01] got her Bible open
[51:03] grown men
[51:05] I'm like these guys you're the biggest
[51:07] impersonators or these guys really got
[51:09] something I don't got
[51:11] it's the home life
[51:14] Glory
[51:15] church I love having good services but
[51:17] let's take that Spirit home with us
[51:18] praise God Amen Hallelujah I love to
[51:21] dance and praise God but let's take some
[51:23] Joy with us home amen
[51:25] so we can love our children love our
[51:27] spouses praise God love one another
[51:29] praise God
[51:30] let's do that
[51:34] then he finally addresses you Masters
[51:36] remember Paul was not called to end
[51:37] slavery
[51:39] right
[51:41] lots of people down Through the Ages
[51:43] were not called by God to end slavery
[51:44] but Abraham Lincoln was and he was
[51:47] faithful praise God
[51:50] so Paul wasn't called he was called to
[51:52] preach the gospel and transform the
[51:53] houses one by one by the power of the
[51:56] Holy Spirit
[51:57] Masters give unto your servants that is
[51:59] just an equal
[52:02] knowing that ye also have a master in
[52:04] heaven
[52:06] praise God what a scripture
[52:09] how many people believe In fairness
[52:12] Paul says Masters be fair with everybody
[52:14] now what about parents should parents be
[52:16] fair should parents have favorites no
[52:18] they shouldn't
[52:19] right they shouldn't
[52:22] but Paul tells the master to be fair to
[52:24] all the servants because you have a
[52:26] master too
[52:28] remember remember that scripture in
[52:29] Malachi read a few weeks ago
[52:32] God told those husbands make sure you
[52:34] treat your wives right because I'm a
[52:36] witness between you and your spouse and
[52:38] your home and I'll pay you back that's
[52:40] what God told the Jewish husbands if you
[52:42] don't treat your wife right I'm going to
[52:44] pay you back
[52:45] in other words I'm going to chasten you
[52:47] I'm going to spank you
[52:49] see when the the leader of the home
[52:52] really has a lot of responsibility on
[52:55] his shoulders
[52:56] and then the parents do too of course
[52:57] the moms have a lot of responsibility
[53:01] but remember we're always under somebody
[53:02] else's leadership right no matter how
[53:04] great we are how much Authority we got
[53:06] all of us no matter what job we get or
[53:08] how many kids we got all of us are under
[53:10] a greater person praise God
[53:13] we all got to seek the continual
[53:15] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[53:17] amen
[53:18] constantly looking to God for leadership
[53:20] of the Holy Spirit
[53:22] like I'm just going to share I'll just
[53:24] share this story without naming the
[53:25] names this one I want to share earlier I
[53:26] didn't get to it somebody called me up
[53:28] yesterday and they're like brother Jesse
[53:30] do you want to move to a certain place
[53:32] and we can start a business together and
[53:34] uh tell the kids about it
[53:38] I'm like me are you talking are you
[53:40] talking to me
[53:41] I said I really like my house here I
[53:44] kind of I'm starting to like it now by
[53:46] God's grace
[53:47] uh I kind of like where I live you know
[53:50] but this person just introduces this
[53:52] thought I'm the leader of the home and
[53:54] like why don't you sell your home
[53:56] use that money and then buy this home
[53:59] for 378 thousand dollars
[54:02] which I don't have that kind of money
[54:05] and then we can start a business
[54:06] together and do all these things
[54:10] and I'm like I only had two I only had
[54:12] three words
[54:14] four words I'll pray about it
[54:16] I'm the dad right everybody's looking to
[54:19] me what are you guys do what are you
[54:20] gonna do
[54:21] I'll pray about it what else can I do
[54:24] oh they're giving me these ideas your
[54:26] children can start this business and the
[54:27] concern your children can do this
[54:29] business you can start a farm and all
[54:30] these things and
[54:32] I like the idea of living healthy but
[54:34] I'm not quite sure if I'm ready for that
[54:35] right now
[54:37] not sure if I want to trade in my tie
[54:39] for overalls and a straw hat
[54:43] I have straw in my mouth I'm not sure if
[54:44] I'm going to go from Pastor Jesse to
[54:46] Farmer Jesse
[54:49] I'm not sure if I want to do that yet
[54:55] but that's just an example of someone
[54:56] introduces the thought now is the
[54:58] thought introduced into my mind
[55:00] you're the leader of the home
[55:03] well what what do I say well I got to go
[55:05] to my master I got to go talk to my
[55:06] master
[55:07] because he's the one that gave me that
[55:09] house
[55:10] and I know he's the one that fixed my
[55:12] kitchen I told you the testimony about
[55:14] that I know he's the one that did that
[55:17] nobody can do that like that
[55:22] the church it always gives us a little
[55:23] spot it always gives us a reminder we
[55:25] need to be humble and realize we got
[55:27] somebody that's we're supposed to be in
[55:28] subjection to praise God we've got a
[55:31] master that we've got to answer to now
[55:32] think about that church I got to answer
[55:34] someday for my family but not only that
[55:35] but how I treated this church
[55:38] I got to answer how I treated each one
[55:40] of you
[55:42] and I'll be judged more harshly than you
[55:44] will
[55:47] boy I'm certainly shaking my shoes here
[55:50] it's not because it's cold
[55:52] that's the fear of the Lord we should
[55:54] have we should always have the fear of
[55:55] the Lord
[55:56] yeah fear the lord
[55:58] remember we have a master we have always
[56:00] have somebody higher than us who's who
[56:02] we have to answer to
[56:06] uh let me end with let's see
[56:10] verse two
[56:11] Colossians 4 verse two I want to bring
[56:13] this out you know even tonight as we
[56:14] were praying I was thinking about this
[56:15] verse the Bible said continue in prayer
[56:19] and watch in the same with Thanksgiving
[56:23] so prayer involves watching giving
[56:25] strict attention to
[56:28] so you don't have a destructive Calamity
[56:31] suddenly overtaking isn't that something
[56:33] the Bible says if we don't pray
[56:35] something is going to overwhelm us if we
[56:38] don't pray
[56:39] we're not going to be able to be
[56:41] prepared for calamities that might come
[56:44] think about that
[56:46] prayer we have to continue in prayer so
[56:49] we're not
[56:51] basically Our Lives Spirit we're not
[56:53] left hopeless because of things that
[56:54] sometimes happen in life
[56:59] I really and then think about it what
[57:01] got what gets us through our hardest
[57:02] times prayer
[57:04] what prepares us for the hardest times
[57:06] prayer
[57:08] why did why do we blow up sometimes when
[57:10] things happen because we didn't pray
[57:11] right we missed that missed that time
[57:14] talking to Daddy
[57:18] I missed that time with my heavenly
[57:19] father
[57:22] so Paul's last words in this last
[57:23] chapter
[57:25] he talks to the Masters and says Don't
[57:26] Stop praying
[57:29] watch
[57:30] and also watching the same with
[57:32] Thanksgiving
[57:33] so constantly give thanks in your
[57:35] prayers thank you Lord for this thank
[57:36] you for this blessing thank you for the
[57:38] church thank you for your love thank you
[57:40] for this job thank you for everything
[57:41] you've given me thank you for answering
[57:42] my prayers amen
[57:44] continue in this don't stop continue
[57:47] praying
[57:49] it means to be instant
[57:51] to adhere to it means to be devoted to
[57:54] oh my
[57:57] Hallelujah Paul
[57:59] be devoted to prayer
[58:01] that's why I like to pray every every
[58:02] every time before surface keeps me
[58:05] devoted to prayer
[58:08] and then watching the same with
[58:10] Thanksgiving
[58:12] again think about this church here's the
[58:15] prophet messenger of the age this is the
[58:17] only letter he'd ever write you think
[58:18] about that remember all those brother-in
[58:20] books out there
[58:21] that moment you I'm gonna use yours real
[58:23] quick
[58:24] think about this what if this was the
[58:26] only message book you had
[58:29] well you better hope you get this one if
[58:30] it's only one you got it
[58:32] as all the major doctrines right in here
[58:37] but Paul had one letter to write to
[58:39] these people how's he going to end it
[58:43] what would he put in it if this is his
[58:45] only letter now I don't know if he knew
[58:47] it or not he remember he wrote two to
[58:48] Timothy wrote two to Corinthians you
[58:51] know
[58:52] what would you put in it he tells them
[58:54] to pray and pray with Thanksgiving
[58:58] pray with Thanksgiving that's why I like
[59:00] that when I felt like the Lord thank you
[59:02] I call her hun now because she lives
[59:03] with us you know she's like she's like
[59:05] mine
[59:06] uh tied for my oldest daughter how about
[59:08] that
[59:09] my twin daughters my twin my twin old is
[59:12] ours how about that
[59:13] hey
[59:17] you know but Paul tells him
[59:20] stay in prayer stay in prayer
[59:23] and watch and be thankful in prayer
[59:28] this is the only time the prophet would
[59:30] write them a letter
[59:33] verse 3.
[59:35] with all praying for us that God would
[59:37] open
[59:39] and with all means together so at the
[59:42] same time so praying at the same time
[59:43] also for us that God would open unto us
[59:46] a door of utterance to speak the mystery
[59:48] of Christ for which also I am in bonds
[59:51] now this verse means a lot to me lately
[59:53] because God opened a door to me in the
[59:55] Amish community
[59:58] and now I get to preach to people that
[1:00:00] actually want to hear the message they
[1:00:02] actually want to hear it
[1:00:04] you know
[1:00:05] along with you but I'm talking about
[1:00:07] like times I appreciate you know other
[1:00:08] churches remember when you just preach
[1:00:10] at the the Hmong youth meetings you
[1:00:12] remember that bang invited me or whoever
[1:00:14] was the president maybe it was
[1:00:16] was it coup I don't know somebody
[1:00:19] is either cooler van was when it must
[1:00:21] have been Coop because bang was already
[1:00:22] in our church
[1:00:24] yeah
[1:00:25] and somehow cool worked it out where
[1:00:27] brother Jesse could come preach them and
[1:00:28] I knew a couple people receiving them
[1:00:30] but I knew most of them weren't hearing
[1:00:32] it you know and that's okay they've got
[1:00:34] they've got their church and they've got
[1:00:35] their beliefs
[1:00:36] but here God has opened a door of
[1:00:38] utterance to the people that want to
[1:00:40] hear the mystery of Christ
[1:00:42] they want to hear it
[1:00:45] church I love when the word of God Comes
[1:00:47] Alive like this
[1:00:50] somebody was praying for me that a door
[1:00:51] I know I was praying for myself too but
[1:00:54] maybe all of you were praying for me or
[1:00:55] something
[1:00:56] but a door of utterance is now open
[1:00:58] where I get to utter the mystery of
[1:01:00] Christ and 17 Souls got baptized praise
[1:01:02] God
[1:01:03] I believe there's more on the way I do I
[1:01:05] believe that by God's grace I'm hoping
[1:01:06] trust him
[1:01:09] so Paul says Don't Stop praying and be
[1:01:11] thankful
[1:01:12] and pray for open doors for the ministry
[1:01:17] so the ministry can get into places it's
[1:01:19] never gotten to before
[1:01:22] Hallelujah
[1:01:23] you know I believe even those meetings
[1:01:25] at brother cams was an Open Door
[1:01:27] because we haven't had meetings like
[1:01:28] that for years
[1:01:29] and Simon just left me a message day he
[1:01:31] said that was such a tremendous time he
[1:01:33] said I still thank God for seeing those
[1:01:36] little kids dancing and singing and
[1:01:38] praising God he said I just he said that
[1:01:40] just overflows the joy of my heart
[1:01:44] Hallelujah it's a it's an Open Door
[1:01:48] and Jesus said if I open the door no man
[1:01:50] can close it
[1:01:51] if I close the door no man can open it
[1:01:54] praise God
[1:01:55] Sea church that's why we've got to keep
[1:01:57] praying got to keep praying God open
[1:01:58] more doors open more doors
[1:02:01] and why should we have open doors so we
[1:02:03] can speak the mystery of Christ
[1:02:07] I just love that word
[1:02:09] put a book on it or something
[1:02:11] the secret
[1:02:13] in other words Paul wanted open doors to
[1:02:15] share the secret of Christ
[1:02:18] all these secrets that are in the Bible
[1:02:20] I want to share God's secret don't touch
[1:02:22] if you like that don't you feel like you
[1:02:23] walk around all the time and you've got
[1:02:24] all these secrets you just wish people
[1:02:25] would ask you about
[1:02:27] I feel like that all the time like just
[1:02:28] somebody asked me about Jesus you know
[1:02:30] somebody just
[1:02:32] I got all these things hiding and I got
[1:02:33] all this all this Revelation don't you
[1:02:35] be like that sometimes you know I got
[1:02:36] all this Revelation I just wish somebody
[1:02:38] could listen to it praise God
[1:02:41] then when somebody does you feel bad
[1:02:43] it's like you offend them and they never
[1:02:44] want to talk to you again you know you
[1:02:45] believe that what happened in the Garden
[1:02:47] of Eden or
[1:02:49] you're not a trinitarian
[1:02:55] s and Paul was you know Paul was praying
[1:02:57] pray for us he was he's I tell you pray
[1:03:00] for us that we'll have an open door
[1:03:02] that we can speak the secret of Christ
[1:03:05] that I may make it manifest now is that
[1:03:08] something your own life
[1:03:10] can manifest the mystery The Secret of
[1:03:13] Christ
[1:03:15] right you can live such a Christian Life
[1:03:17] in front of people that they'll say
[1:03:18] Jesus Christ lives in that person isn't
[1:03:20] that the mystery Christ in you the hope
[1:03:22] of glory how we know that's the mystery
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:24] what's the mystery that's been hidden
[1:03:26] down for the ages it's Jesus Christ
[1:03:27] Living in you praise God
[1:03:30] that should be our prayer Lord
[1:03:33] help me give me doors of utterance where
[1:03:36] I can speak the word of Christ and
[1:03:38] people can see me manifesting your
[1:03:41] spirit to them as I ought to
[1:03:46] now we can all be honest and say we
[1:03:48] don't always speak like we ought to
[1:03:50] we don't always testify like we ought to
[1:03:53] but we can pray God open doors so I can
[1:03:57] do it like I ought to
[1:03:59] let's say I know our feet musicians
[1:04:00] could come I'll stop right there we're
[1:04:02] already getting kind of late
[1:04:09] so we'll pick up there Lord willing and
