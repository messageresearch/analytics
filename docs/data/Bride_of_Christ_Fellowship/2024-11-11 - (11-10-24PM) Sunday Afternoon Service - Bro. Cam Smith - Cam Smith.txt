TRANSCRIPT
========================================
am uh very much so looking forward to seeing what God is going to do here amen uh we're in a process right now where Satan is fighting harder than ever before but all that really tells us is it's going to the wind's even going to be sweeter uh the victory is uh it's getting sweeter all the time isn't it uh when you see especially you know you see people that have left this message they' they've moved on they've gone other routes and and uh yet you sit you sit right here and you're like I still believe this I still can't find nothing myself I can't find nothing wrong with this is like perfect Hallelujah so uh we Rejoice uh that the Lord has given us that Revelation amen uh so once again uh we love every one of you you're you're precious and uh let's stand for the reading of the word now I'm just going to preach another simple message uh I've I've pre been preaching some uh different serieses I've been preaching the the last message uh that Jesus gave to his disciples at home I've had quite a blast doing that I'm seeing the relevance of it I'm seeing how powerful it is to us I'm so glad that when we look at that you know what uh he's the vine we're the branches that's for sure amen uh and then I've been working also with what happened in 1963 that has been a fun fun time for me I was actually praying and uh the the Lord just came to me and said Put it on a chart and I did and uh it's it's helped me tremendously even and the church uh so we're appreciative of all those things from the Lord uh tonight we're just going to take just a little thought and uh once again I don't come in as a pastor I'm coming in as an evangelist so uh I hope that's all right and uh I'm not even going to do a PowerPoint tonight we're just going to go with it uh Hebrews 11:1 if you have your Bibles Hebrews 11:1 and after that uh we are going to 1 John 53 after that we're just going to preach a very simple little message tonight where is the victory okay uh where is the victory is between this in the open and sealed evidence so I I think Victory is pretty important right now Hallelujah uh Hebrews 11:1 it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen uh for by it the elders obtained a good report uh through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so how is God doing all this through faith we understand that the worlds ref framed by the word of God yes so when you place faith on the word of God what does it do materializes Hallelujah remember the quotes our Prophet gave us it's going to come to a time where you'll speak it and it will materialize right in front of you I believe that Hallelujah and he says so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear okay 1 John 53 so notice he made something out of nothing didn't he yes hallelujah hallelujah a lot of us look at that I I was just a big nothing I still feel like a nothing but he done made something of us right showed you you're the Bride of Jesus Christ what what more could you want you don't have to be like David try to be a David was satisfied just let me be a doorkeeper in the house of my God but God actually called you to sit on the throne with him Hallelujah uh 1 John 53 it says for this is the love of God uh that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith Hallelujah you're going to be a Victor you're going to be an overcomer how you going to do it by faith Hallelujah let's bow our heads for a word of prayer thank you Lord our precious Lord Jesus Christ um we just taking this little thought as we we just feel the pole to go that way Lord and we're asking oh God that you just add your blessings to it Lord we we know that uh these days are long oh God and yet uh we want to make every moment count Lord so here it is we're bringing our all to the house of God again this evening uh once again inviting you Lord uh we understand by the prophet Lord that you never turn down one invitation so we invite you to be here oh God we we invite you to change our lives we we also God we we want to see you manif ested in our midst oh God uh it's really our heart's desire is to the way we read everything in the Bible we believe that we're still in the Bible days so we're asking oh God that you just be merciful unto us tonight and uh knowing that you're still at the throne you still ain't left there that that really gives us confidence oh God that you're here to minister the word of God unto us so Lord we're just asking uh uh raise us up oh God give energy to those that might be tired uh give strength oh God uh in mind that we might be able to receive the word uh for this moment oh God so we're just believing that you do it uh give us a move of your spirit we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we say Amen you may be seated I did not get to greet brother Vang I I kind of grabbed him two or three times and sister CA were so happy the lord gave them a baby there uh that's awesome Amen and uh two boys and two girls amen and uh with with parents like that you know they're just going to be a big bunch of sweethearts aren't they so uh I was writing brother van their day when we were doing these things and we've known each other for 20 years I'm like wow said the only thing I regret is just same with my brother Jesse I wish we could all been together this whole time uh but God has had different routes for us amen uh so we're happy with whatever the Lord wants and yet we know that there's a time that we'll be gathered together unto him Hallelujah uh there'll be the Gathering of the outcast amen you realize that's the scripture causes right causes the outcast brother brandom uh called Jesus an outcast it's just somebody nobody wants nothing to do with amen uh but yet those outcasts what were they actually called Victors so tonight we just want to work this little thought uh where is the Victory and uh we showed you uh where the victory is here it's in your faith uh but we'll just uh try to go through this as best as we can um in if we Define that word Victory uh it means Conquest the defeat of an enemy in battle uh or of an antagonist in contest as a gaining of the superiority in war or combat uh Victory supposes uh the power of an enemy or an antagonist to prove inferior to that of the Victor amen uh Victory however depends not always on Superior skill or Valor uh it is often gained by the fought or mistake of the vanquished my there's a lot going on there with the Victor right there's a lot going on there with victory free amen uh but yet uh we're so glad because you see uh this world was not created uh that Victory would be something that we feel like we have uh from playing a sport or uh or maybe by uh um gaining mass mass amounts of money or or just being uh Superior intellectually or whatever that is but uh we understand that God made this world and this world was actually brought forth to bring forth the elect seed amen uh that's the whole purpose of all this right now uh you think about it the very purpose that this world is still going on is because God still is in the business of pro of what promoting or uh growing his elect seeds so that they can bring forth the perfect victory that God caused them to have amen hallelujah you see we can go in the scripture we could talk about this all night long but uh you see in the Old Testament uh the scripture says he did not call them to be the tail he called them to be the head amen he didn't make them to run from 10,000 he made five to chase 10,000 amen it was always God's will that as his church is gathered together unto him that they would be able to drive back the enemy amen uh Hallelujah a lot of times brother sister uh we get in the mindset that we're we live on the defense Hallelujah we know the book of Ephesians tells us about the whole armor of God and and uh wow uh boy I've got to have everything covered right but we understand that when you look at that armor there's absolutely nothing on the backside amen you are not made to run from the enemy Hallelujah you are not made to to shy back in into some sort of complacent defeated condition but you are actually called to what engage the battle amen alls you needed for one is a weapon and that was the sword right the sword of the spirit to put the enemy to flight amen and remember it's the Wilds or the tricks of the devil that you need the shield of Faith amen you have as a soldier in the army of Jesus Christ the ability to stop all the attacks that brings to you if we had time to go through it you could find out that uh uh when you look at Psalms 111 our Prophet talked about the tree that would not wither Hallelujah you can go into second Peter 1 with the stature of a perfect man and what if you do these things you shall never fall right God has ordained us to pack this Revelation right now amen hallelujah but there's only one way that you're going to be able to do that and that is to actually Express what you are amenah this is a failure this is a loser right you think about it some of the greatest victories you'll have in this life is actually overcoming this Hallelujah let's look what a prophet said how can I overcome in 63 he says see as I said at the beginning you are born defeated that's a good start right and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated and you're in a defeated World amongst defeated people amongst defeated Creed s defeated denominations sir you've got to come to Victory some way Hallelujah brother sister I'm just going to be bold so so excuse me for my boldness but people are the vast majority of this message is living in a defeated State Hallelujah and there's many reasons why Hallelujah they they've been brought under for for the most part they've been brought in Creeds and dogmas they've been brought into denominationalism Hallelujah I remember 20 years ago I never would have guessed coming into this message that I would see the same things that I seen in the Assembly of God but I'm watching it I'm watching Vacation Bible schools we're watching the youth separated brother Jesse and sister Chris we at the church last year doing that right when I was ministering that but but what we find that it was always God God's desire that the word would be enough amen the word would be all you would need for victory amen hallelujah hallelujah so if VBS ain't in here for our children do I need it for my children but if you actually look at the underlying effects of it what it actually does is it teaches your child that you can blend entertainment in with the word well what's more fun is it the entertainment M ment or the word hallelujah these these these these young Victors up here what's going to be their victory in this world when they can see that they were made to live this word out and that they can watch no matter what they see around the message world the actual World itself but that they have the ability if they just submit fully to this they will produce this amen Hallelujah you see there's got to be some way to overcome you've got to be able to get to Victory somehow now Luke 188 it says uh it's working of course with a parable of the of the just and the unjust judge right but uh we see in the eth verse says I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on Earth amen amen so when he was actually when Christ comes hardly anyone will have faith any faith think about it when brother Brandon preached a Seal's message he said there only be so many he said and the rest won't even want to come that's right they don't even want to be in a Rapture they don't even care about about what beating the Devil up amen you were called to drive the devil mad amen you were called to watch through Christ be a foe that the devil don't even know what to do with you let me ask you does the devil know what to do with you remember brother brandom I believe was in the contest he said that he studies you out he studied you out your whole life he knows what little weaknesses get you to fall get you to do things you're ought not do right but you see just because he has been that wise in his attempt to destroy you does not mean that your weapon of the word of God is Not stronger to destroy him amen notice that's why he has to pervert the word because if you get a revelation of the true word you yourself will become an invincible Army before God hallelujah so we understand in Hebrews 11:6 it says but without faith very simple okay but without faith it is impossible to please him Hallelujah for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him think about this for you that came up for prayer this morning this afternoon you literally were exercising Faith okay did you feel it what if you didn't feel it see what are you basing your faith off Faith doesn't look at what you feel Faith takes what you believe Hallelujah remember when it came down to John Ryan what did John Ryan do he came up three times in the prayer line blind because brother Bram said Do you believe he said yes I believe you're I'm Healed and he walks off he goes back to his seat can't see comes back up he says brother Bram I I need you to pray for me again I or or I don't know what's going on here you you said I was healed and brother Bram said I thought you said you believed and that's how it ended but something had to transform in John Ryan's heart so that he was no longer looking at what he couldn't see think about it that is a challenge that many of us have never even entered into that's right he had almost one of the ultimate challenges because frankly he couldn't see but yet he had to say he was healed Hallelujah so what did he do that's what I'm saying it doesn't matter what you felt this morning afternoon it doesn't matter what you feel right now we invited him he will not turn down the invitation Hallelujah so what did John Ryan do he he was passing out or selling papers he'd be out there blind he said extra extra Read All About It praise the Lord I'm healed amen what you don't see or maybe we should see is that was actually a Victor who is in expression by faith he caught the Revelation that he was going to be healed in a circumstance where there was no justification for it that's right Hallelujah yes Hallelujah so days and days go on praise the Lord read all about it I'm healing I can see he had to be willing to act on what he said he believed yes sir yes sir he was willing Hallelujah brother and sister I don't care if you got unsaved family members Hallelujah this message goes into it amen and tells us that what just like Rahab we can believe we can claim them for the Lord I'm coming after them but you can't do that on a carnal level it's got to be faith that sets inside of you and says you know what they're mine hallelujah what is that that is the expression of Faith no they're not coming they're not coming maybe he's right maybe brother Cam's right it shows you never believed it right when you question the what you perceive is the will of God faith is the substance of things hoped for you can't please God without it so you might as well live by it Hallelujah but we see that what John Ryan finally got into the position of persecution where he was in the he was in the barber shop right getting his haircut and they wanted to Snicker and pick on them a little bit they said John Ryan I thought you said you were healed by that that healer like that and what right he said I and when he confessed yes I am healed amen then his eyes opened up and he could finally see amen but when did John Ryan get the victory was it at the end this is one thing I love brother sister because tie in with the scriptures Jesus I'm reading through the The Book of John Jes Jesus had already got to a spot with a crucifixion he's like yeah it's already done he wasn't say oh I wonder if he knew he was going to live out what the word said he was to do so if you tie in John 14:12 The Works that I do shall ye do Hallelujah cuz he goes into the fire father and greater work shall you do amen you are only identifying yourself in the word hallelujah hallelujah now watch faith is our Victory 58 he says was not it Lazarus who was laying dead in the ground and had already corruption set in and Jesus said to Martha where have ye buried him and if you won't doubt you shall see the glory of God did not I tell you not to doubt he said to gyrus that night or that day if you only believe you can see the glory of God God can't change his essence or nature just like our Prophet said God would be much happier he would be he'd be when he starts seeing the Eagles start flapping their wings whether they fly or not CU what by Nature that eagle will fly there's nothing that can stop that eagle from flying there's nothing that is going to be able well what if he don't fly remember the prophet said that what that Mama Eagle will be right there to catch them Hallelujah but what God wants to see that you believe it you can't hide away from it all the time because remember faith is is the victory hallelujah hallelujah watch what he says so he he's talking here he said did not I tell you not to doubt he said to gyus that night or or that day if you only believe you can see the glory of God he said then Faith overcomes death faith is the victory over death faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is a victory over worry faith is the victory over frustrations faith is the victory over the world Hallelujah so how many are going to make a Rapture here yes sir you believe that remember I Prophet said everything that you need to make a Rapture is already inside of you I just I just I was going to preach a different message and brother in that message brother BR said do you really realize that your glorified body is sitting here right now maybe we can explain that Hallelujah another quote brother Bram said he said he said God will give you power he said in every Dimension that it's meant to be lived out in you every Dimension do you believe that he believed that he watched that right Hal Hallelujah remember the one time the uh the the people's baby died and brother Bram said let me pray about it and when he went back to the people he said leave them there leave your son there I found him there Hallelujah take your hand off it it's the hand of the Lord sir well what was he doing he actually was entering into a different dimension in exercising in ability to overcome in that Dimension so that's why you see even in the realm of demonology you have the ability to overwhelm the devil even in the Unseen Hallelujah you see that's what this message did which is almost power more powerful it's just tremendous but when brother brandom was sitting there catching the spirits he would watch this demon go try to help someone else with the same demon we know how Satan works but we even know with that being exposed that if that individual just stayed there and believed it didn't matter how many demons came over the faith that laid in that predestinated seed was Unstoppable amen why because the faith that he placed inside of you can make take a Rapture hallelujah it's so strong your Prophet said that if if the laws provided it you could create a world and go live on it all right any partakers Hallelujah but the issue we even find it in Hebrews 4 it says that what they did not mix Faith with the word that's right this morning's message ain't going to do you if if if Faith doesn't reveal it to you Hallelujah I want God to let that Revelation sit there that there he is thinking about me there he is he knows my thoughts he's wanting me to entertain him with my love for him he's wanting him he's wanting me to not give up by falling into a temporal State and losing track of who I am yes sir how is he going to produce invincibility in you how's he going to do it well invincibility is proven by battle sir it's proven by battle you look at a lot of these countries the battles they're going through they don't even know if they're going to be living tomorrow don't think you're going to get out of it easy but I'll tell you what that's why this word was sown that's what God is trying to build in you because why if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ brother cam why' you say if exactly there's something I say I am the Bride of Jesus Christ but if I'm I do it again I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ you're for the Bride of Jesus Christ then how if we truly believe that can what can we not exercise the rights that's given to us by election Hallelujah yes sir yes sir he literally redeemed you to bring you to the Revelation that you're saved but it wasn't supposed to stop at saved Hallelujah when you link the scriptures together salvation and healing go hand in hand the god that saved us and the god that healed us hallelujah they work hand in hand but they'll only come by your faith amen that's why I mean if we would be serious in the moment many times we don't see Divine Healing when you know why because we really don't believe we're saved and get quiet on that got real quiet on that ding ding ding ding ding ding you may now move to point B but what is that the revelation of Salvation if you can have faith for salvation that same faith exercises healing just as simple Hallelujah and you see no wonder the Bible is going to tell us to gird up our mind because the devil's constantly coming and trying to tell you that you're something you're not his whole motive is to show that you just came here by chance his whole desire is to show you that you can't live this and you know what he's 100% right you can't live it remember that's why you had to bypass your theophany your word body you had to bypass that in order to stand Temptation well wait a minute so when this Earth is is over when when this bride is raptured you'll get your glorified body you'll get your theophany all of it right our Prophet told us about this who is this MDC right and we found that what the dead will have to get their bodies we'll have to get our theophanies so we all got something in common we're trying to come into completion the way God made it to be in the order of deity big question then how are you going to overcome without a theophany that's how simple this is it really is how simple this is he made it so that his wife could only live in the joining and uniting with himself that's the danger of being a false anointed ones because they want a form of God godliness Hallelujah but they want to express it Matthew 7 according to their own will but this mind that Christ wants to place in you it takes on the form of no reputation Hallelujah that's how brother brandham had the victory yes he literally thought he was nothing yes Hallelujah he said forget any everything about William Brandon when I go that's right yes sir he realized he said there's no sound thing in me at all Hallelujah well why was that not because he was an elected seed but in the flesh level in the spirit realm he was still in a fallen temporal condition he did not want you to lean upon his in abilities right right that's why he could only point you to the word hallelujah so you can only look at the word and what join with the word in order to express the victory of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hope I haven't lost you that's just we're just preaching just having a good time up here preaching yeah I get a little sweaty I can't help it so he says Psalms 98:1 he said a Psalm he said oh sing unto the Lord a new song for Heath done marvelous things his right hand his holy arm ha gotten him the victory he went and got the victory are all things under his feet they are in in the spiritual realm yes but you see the victory God wants to give you is not a high-paying job necessarily it's it's not the it's not the typical American 101 dream and vision married one dog two children nice car nice job great retirement that is not the victory that God is worried about getting you that's right brother now we think on those lines Hallelujah hey brother and sister one of the greatest things I ever did was I reached up the faith and I believe I prayed the right prayer I was just as young as some of these brothers here I I believe I was 19 or 20 I was in a deadend job making 8 an hour 1990 99 somewhere in there and literally I was making eight bucks an hour I had a truck payment I was still living at home and I was watching my bank account go down I'm like $8 an hour I just wanted to be a tool and die maker that's all I wanted to be and I just became a Christian and I'm like this ain't working I was still in denomination somebody's a God nothing was working for me and I remember I just had this I went to church that day Assembly of God and this thought comes to me pray about it I'm like all right I remember getting down at my knees on that seat just like this watching the same thing right now pretty blessed and I got down on my knees and I said Lord Jesus I said this financial situation is not working out for me I said Lord this is all I'm asking I'm not asking to be a rich man and I'm not asking to be a poor man I said Lord could you give me a job that will support a family which I did not know was going to be this big and I got up and it just seemed like a just an inspired moment and I went back and I'm like amen all right three months later I have a guy come up to me he said and he just came up to me he said he said hey how you doing I Saidi doing good I graduated with his daughter' and he said he said did you ever think about getting a local 501 first thing's out of his mouth I'm like no he said I'm I'm going to give you all the information so he gives me all the information he says go down there and I went down there and I got the job and right now I'm not a rich man I'm not a poor man but I have enough to support a family and I've had it for all these years now Hallelujah it was just simply asking God with the right State of Mind the right motive the right objective Hallelujah you think that God I'll tell you what how many rich people are going to make it not many I have an needle right came going have an needle right a many if I would have said Lord Make Me a Millionaire you know I wouldn't be here right now don't you I wouldn't have been honestly I would have never done it but God put you in those moments of inspiration to see what you'll do about it Hallelujah sometimes he's just laying on you to see what kind of cry you have and to see if you'll be more aligning with the word than aligning with personal motive hallelujah hallelujah and if you can place faith on that you'll find that God will give you the answer hallelujah hallelujah now think about this so then I get that job brother Simon was was not in a good job either within a year he fills out the application for the same Union I'm in gets in a few laters years later then brother Dustin gets in Hallelujah but it just went from one to the next to the next and it work can you believe that you do believe that don't you that's a victory just think of God cares about your financial needs how much more does he care about your spiritual needs how much more does he care about your family members right a soul is worth 10,000 worlds right we hear it we believe it and God gives you the same ability to place faith on the temporal and it works that he wants to do in the spiritual realm amen you realize when you make a claim on your family member if you stay right there and say God I know you gave him to me Faith is a substance of things hoped for you hope for it well I haven't seen it sometimes God will make you put a claim on the most evil person that you know and sometimes that's your family member Hallelujah but what is it he puts that little hope in your heart and then you pounce it amen I believe that you'll give it to me God how you going to get victory over that the only way that you're going to get Victory is to realize realiz that that thought came from God and it's to exercise through God brother sister we've all watched it way too much watch a little issue get on somebody we might even be guilty of it ourselves you say my asthma my diabetes my my migraines you done claimed every single thing you got right my sore ankle yes sir yes sir remember when brother brandom said he said and when you get healed you're get you're actually hearing from your glorified body hallelujah what I'm trying to show you is Jesus Christ already purchased your Victory thank you Lord if Christ got the victory then what did he give you when he took your place that's what you have to realize he took your place all he asked you to do is to take up your cross which is what to surrender your life to him hallelujah hallelujah what the other day I just preached on how can I overcome and I was absolutely shocked by looking at it but when brother Bram says how can we overcome you know how you have to surrender to his will that's it yes I have to surrender to his will well what's his will his word the O we're sitting here like non and we're like man give me somebody to destroy give me a great feet let me climb a mountain and God's way is actually really simple you're going to have to yield to these dirty Waters of Jordan yes sir how many times did he dip seven times which one made the difference the seventh so when Jesus Christ through our Prophet brought back the revelation of water baptism this was a revelation for those who would be turned back to a young man the scripture said he had flesh as a child right Hallelujah this revelation of water baptism is so powerful but yet we don't even Place faith on it hallelujah what what does it mean to us you see all God's doing is revealing to you who you are I see it it's in the name of Jesus Christ I see it father son holy ghost that is Lord Jesus Christ I see it Hallelujah so what are you actually doing you're getting baptized in the power of that name the power of that name brings results Hallelujah let's continue Isaiah 59 15th verse it says ye truth faileth and he that departeth from Evil maketh himself a prey and the Lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment did you get that Watch What Happens here I want you to see this what happens when truth fails Hallelujah heard a little the the little discourse about politics and so forth out there dare we begin to preach on geocentricity I'm so looking forward to this how about a flat Earth let's go farther let's go all the way go big or go home I'm gonna be going home anyway good luck brother Jesse truth is failing you don't know you don't know who to trust there's really actually only one thing you can trust TR now there really is only one now why did God make it that way you can't trust a politician you can't you almost can't trust the abilities of of of a preacher or a pastor your brother sister hey has anybody here failed anyone else here anybody well brother Jesse and sister Christen are the only ones okay oh and Haven you I you got to tell the truth Sith tell the truth oh truth faileth but we fail people all the time I fail people all the time I don't even mean to it's just natural I don't have to try it just happens yay truth faileth and he that departeth from Evil maketh himself a prey people that try to apart from Evil make themselves a prey that is it stand for Christ getting any easier no you're literally watching this what's truth where's truth who's truth is anything I've got taught truth I'm going to try to depart from Evil oh boy here it comes Hallelujah and the Lord sought the Lord sees this type of a condition and it displeased him that there was no judgment he did not like to see this type of situation for his children so what'd he do and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor 16th verse right he wondered there's no intercessor for them so why was an intercessor sent to show you truth and to what to bring the word in such a way that those that are departing from Evil they would not just sit as a prey look at Paul we know Paul came to it but do you realize how many times he avoided death look at his resume if you want to feel ashamed of yourself Hallelujah so he says therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him he seen the lack so he bridged the Gap amen for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and as a a helmet of salvation upon his head he put on the the garments of Vengeance for clothing and clad was clad with Zeal as a cloak Hallelujah let's jump down 20th verse it says and the Redeemer shall come to Zion which is always the bride our Prophet said and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob saith the Lord Christ came to bring you Victory amen don't you see the whole purpose of inter is to bring you Victory that's what it is if you have an intercessor you have a Pathway to Victory [Music] Hallelujah I'm GNA try to skip around let's go to Faith is our Victory again 58 he said now Faith paragraph 23 faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes Faith overcomes it takes the challenges on and it overcomes them all right faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do so what is this faith that overcomes the world what does it do what is Faith what is the Conqueror conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prisons that's what conquer means we've been made more than conquerors throw in jail throw into the prison override beat down when's the last time you beat the devil down see we live underprivileged and a prophet said we live under privileged because we don't know who we are Hallelujah it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now yes hallelujah it's one most astonishing things brother brandom says he says do you have to sin he said no how you doing great I'm overcoming Hallelujah he says it means that you have overcome he said you've whipped it you're greater than it is oh I feel religious right now which was first first a sinner or a savior Hallelujah a savior for a savior is more powerful than a sin which was first the Healer or a sickness he said it couldn't be a Healer unless it was over the sickness the Healer right it says it is a Healer it could conquer the winess and faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil faith is the victory hallelujah hallelujah every single curse of the devil you realize I know this personally said people can place curses on you and all of a sudden if you're not careful if you're not spiritually minded you'll watch yourself doing things you're like why in the world am I doing this because if you are not active to conquer the curse that's placed on you it can get you oh we're quiet not again this second round of quietness that's how it goes your parents could have put curses on you you're your your person at the job can say stuff to you just think about it if the power of the spoken word is how we are to overcome that is that is is the Pinnacle of where we're going do you see how powerful your words are when you speak Evil all you got to do is say one time you're having a bad day you say when it rains it pours and you will be repenting I can't say it no more because I found out if I say that it just gets worse it gets worse it gets worse and then all of a sudden I'm just like that was stupid then you got to repent but I found the best way to deal with it is don't even say it to begin with don't accept you feel something rolling on your body it's nothing I don't have to accept that because the devil can try to curse you Hallelujah don't accept things that you don't have to take you don't have to accept the box of rattlesnakes you see part of the victory is realizing you don't even have to accept it yesall Hallelujah when Satan tried to give me diabetes you know what I did I got down I know it was now I know it was I know it was the voice of the devil that came to me and it said you have diabetes just like your family does and I remember I was so awkward at the moment because I'm so dizzy and I'm like oh this is like some sugar thing or something and it said that to me and all of a sudden something just raised up and I said no no no no no no no I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I don't have diabetes anybody heard me tell this Hallelujah so I went I went and and wiggled my way to bed I laid down in my bed next day I was just fine but when I said that to the Lord after I rebuked it I said Lord if you heal me Lord if you take this away I will testify of it so a month later you know good old smart guy me I forgot all about it it never came to me and then all of a sudden I was up there and I was just I was cranking Away In Living Waters Hallelujah I letting the water roll and the Holy Ghost came to me and said I healed you you said that you would testify so I started testifying that God God delivered me of that diabetes that was trying to take my body guess what happened that night I got home and all of a sudden I'm like it tried coming back on me I'm like okay this is too obvious now I said Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I don't have to accept this it went away after that I went to albian and preach and it came on me to preach again guess what happened after that it that demon of diabetes tried to jump on me again I rebuked it and I went on and here I am what 8 10 years wife know better than me 8 10 years later I've got the victory I don't know if you know it's I'm in perfect health to the glory of God hallelujah not to my vitamins and supplements but to the glory of God but what is it faith is the victim three it's just simple and it's laying remember brother Bram said that faith will lay dormant it'll lay dormant inside of you it that means it won't do anything you've got to activate it that's why brother BR said he said where faith is preached the people live I'm here to activate your faith sister Lena Hallelujah I'm here to what I'm here to preach to you that the god that's with you amen will help you what conquer the enemy conquer beat him down throw him in prison that's brother bram's definition I'm just telling you what he said yes think about it he became so experienced with it that it was just natural like all right let's Devil's gonna go the more he had experience in his communion and his walk with God the more that Victory lived was he immune well no he still had that squirrel every seven years I he had all sorts of stuff he had to deal with but but what was it for that measure of the spirit of God of what it was doing for other people he was able to be in the zone with the Lord living that life of Victory think about it why do people want to glorify brother Brandon he's a sinner saved by grace just like us but because he was able to happened to the holy spirit in such a way that his life was Victorious do you think the devil wants another person like that to deal with uh-uh but I'm sorry to tell him he's got something to deal with nowadays Hallelujah because we're here to exercise thatu Hallelujah we got five people that got cancer whatever you know what God gave us the ability like a Roman Centurion right Lord I know you'll do it Hallelujah we got to get serious about it too got get serious Hallelujah I thought to myself the other day we had 30 straight days at the church we went a whole month every single day at the church praying uh doing something we tried to really up our prayer with it though and we found the Lord really blessed it but but you know what I just came to the idea I'm like man we've tried everything but giving God more you know what happens when you give God more he gives you moreall it's true Hallelujah you you want to see a more Victorious Life pray more you want to see more you want to see more power in your life move by Faith remember John 4 or no excuse me was it James 4 said you have not cuz you ask not when you ask you ask a Miss they're asking to be a millionaire don't ask for that ask like what you want what God wants for you but remember God still he wants to give you what you desire that's right it's one thing I noticed about about John 13 to John 17 he said ask for what you will ask for what you desire and you shall have it that that's one of the whole things it says it like five six times in those several chapters he just keeps on reiterating this ask that your Joys might be full ask it I'll give it to you whatever you ask the the the father in my name you'll have it anybody don't want to be there we want to be there amen but he had to tell them ask Hallelujah hey we're just glad we got an an easy day here in that but brother and sister God called us for more than just easy days amen he called us to fight in the realm of the Demonic of the Demonic uh uh fourth dimension and to overcome what the devil's doing amenu hallelujah hallelujah let's read just a little bit more I got to close guess are just easy to preach to Hallelujah he said faith in what he said faith is the Victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it is the victory say my arms still crippled but faith is the victory I still feel sick but faith is the victory oh it over comes the world when you can climb into into God by prayer until you've seen the thing conquered under you remember was it restoration of the Bride tree brother brother Jesse correct me but brother Bram said he said you can pray in such a way that the devil has to give in you can take God's agent the Holy Spirit and enforce a claim on the devil right Hallelujah I might just dance around the room I'm feeling pretty good right now hallelujah hallelujah hey we invited him I'm feeling good Hallelujah so what he says there is nothing that can hurt you then you've overcome so when you climb up in prayer and it becomes a revelation it's mine right there nothing can hurt you then watch what he says you got 50 miles of Elbow Room you're sailing free then you who've been a drunkard and a slave to Whiskey you'll be a master over him then that Old Devil of alcohol that made you drink he's your master now but when you get Faith I don't mean Make Believe real Faith he's your servant then hallelujah you who can't lay down tobacco you men and women when it comes to a place to where you get to that spot to where you have overcome it by faith you'll Master it then no matter what issue it is climb up by prayer believing that God will set you free amen that God will set your family member free he'll set your church member free he'll bring the unity in this place Hallelujah remember what your Prophet said no Unity no power that's what he said Hallelujah Living Waters we have the same issues same issues I'm sure you're dealing with too and it's even harder now why because remember when when Jesus went through that last message in John 6 he had to run he had to run the multitudes Away by the word of God you realize that he said except you drink my flesh and or eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me they're like okay this is a hard saying we're out of here do you realize he had to get that to a place it was in John 13 where he dismissed Judas so there was nothing but elect seed left and our Prophet said he had to do that because he had to give them strong Doctrine oh my Hallelujah are you the Alexine you can handle that word and you can what you can handle uh allowing the Holy Spirit to what by faith bring the unity that produces God's power in this place hallelujah oh Hallelujah I'm almost done I got to stop 1 Corinthians 1557 here he goes 55 says oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory the The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is a law but thanks be to God which giveth us us the victory through our lord Jesus christall death where's your sting grave where your Victory what are we worried about Hallelujah hey we we call potato potata out there I don't care if you get a Democrat or Republic it's all going the same why because this is not our kingdom sir God's going to change this thing over with a son of David I'm looking forward to it aren't you Hallelujah but he still gives us the victory one more quote we'll quit Victory Day 63 421 he says notice Joshua had a vday at the river too Joshua had a vday at Jericho he certainly did there where he had crossed he had a vday first at the ri River V vday Victory Day there he is in the month of April probably a mile across Jordan was C on up on in top of the mountains up there there snows mountain and all over the plains the river was spread he said no doubt the enemy would have said now God is quite a general isn't he lead his army right up up here to the time of spring when the river is the worst which a the worst to C time to cross and then lead his army up there and lead them to cross no God lets disappointments happen to show Victory you ever think that's why God lets disappointments come your way good if you have faith that's what God showed it to us forall oh if we could only see that see you only see that these things that seems to be buring you so buring you and upsetting you they are trials they are things to stand still Focus your glasses on the word of God and speak the word and then just walk forward that's all there is to it we get to a time we say God I don't know what to do I'm up against it speak the word Lord I believe and just start walking forward God does the opening up of the sea you just keep walking let's stand let's stand Hallelujah very simple brother sister I hope you're blessed but what it really really pushes us to do is we have to constantly walk before the Lord be conscious that we're walking before the Lord and be conscious that God is in control of all of our battles Hallelujah remember when it came to the Wilderness God sent his Angel before them to set everything up for their Victory are you the bride of Christ we said that yeah I'm the bride of Christ then what are these mountains before me what are these disappointments what are these frustrations anybody ever get tired of yourself all the time all the time you know God lets that disappointment sit there why because you got a victory coming but it's a revelation now I might be crazy in saying this but when brother Bram said you don't have to sin I believe there's coming a time and probably I don't know if it' be right for the coming Lord or where it's at but we are going to become such a Mastery over this by the spirit of God is pouring out that Satan is literally going to be like what what can I do now think about it he'll prove your invincibility he's going to send things that look like they can destroy you in America absolutely just think about what's going on in Israel right now you realize for the last year Israel's absolutely just dealt with blow after blow after blow after blow blow after blow but what what did God let it come to God let it come to the spot enough is enough time to going on the offensive and they're absolutely tearing them up that's natural Israel but what about spiritual Israel I don't know if your battles have been hard the last year or too seems like wow he just gets another shot here we go but God is letting all these things come Hallelujah showing that they can't take you out showing that they can't slow you down and even if they are if you feel like they're slowing you down you're still in the race but why is God doing it because the season is getting ready for a turnaround Hallelujah it could be tonight amen but what we're looking and saying the Victory Is Ours why because he already purchased it see God wants us to be more acquainted with the victory than with the defeat remember who's defeated Satan's defeated we don't sympathize being with the devil in his defeat remember every single thing you go through it's there to build character it's there to prove you out I think we're doing all right don't you depends what you're looking at are you looking at the word or are you looking at yourself because remember this thing is such a failure God's going to have to change it but he gave you the ability to conquer this little serpent flesh is this Fallen you ain't taking this with you your other body might look like that but that's this is not the real you I hate this thing it's the greatest battle fall but we can overcome it we can be victorious we can put it under our feet why because Christ paid for it with his blood can we be more acquainted with the blood with intercession than this temporal world that's the question as we close just take a minute and think to yourself what if you been affiliating with have you been more affiliated with defeat depression oppression bodily issues what or have you been in tune with battle and victory God wants to Astound you with how much of a victory he wants to give you that's why he brought it brother sister I appreciate I appreciate your hearts being attentive to the word of God how many want to live in the Overflow Hallelujah that song ain't a joke you can live in the Overflow remember the scripture he'll pour you out a blessing there won't be room to receive that's what he wants to do I'm just a tail I'm Just a Nobody I'm just you're just listening to the wrong person we are more than Overcomers than Christ Jesus hallelujah how many want to be more more affectioned with this Victorious Christ he did this see intercession is Victory he's bringing you Victory aren't you glad he paid for that yes so think about it even now as we get ready to pray think about an era in your life and you you might feel like you're getting trampled you might feel like you're getting defeated it might be something that's that's really it's become a real taint to your faith how many would like to give that to the intercessor tonight how many like to say you know what I'm going to put that in the hands of the Lord but not just put that in the hands of the Lord but say I'm going to put it there cuz he's going to bring my victory and I am not going to remove one iota from that Victory remember brother brandom said if you want that you have to stay on his hands until he gives it to you Charles finny talked about in the revivals of religion he said he said the issue with Christians he says is they're praying for too many things at once he said and they can never focus on one thing they're so sporadic in mind that they can't even exercise Faith because they're trying to exercise it on everything and never getting even the answer for one thing it was quite a profound statement because a lot of times that what we do oh Lord thank you for healing me or and we just move on we never even think about it there's there's obviously some truth to some of these things but when we're praying for healing a cancer we got to pray for these things are serious we got to get busy because our God wants to do it do you believe he wants to do it do you believe he wants to do it in you Hallelujah God sees your hearts especially towards that statement so when the son of man comes shall he find Faith what should be your answer right now yes he will me you sister you sister you brother he'll find Faith here yes shall he find it yep amen I'm one of them Hallelujah that's right let's bow our heads for a word of prayer those things that we just talked about maybe there's something that's been a great pressure in your life but today you want you realize that you're maybe like Joshua right at the river seems like it's no way to go through it especially with such a a mass of people or whatever but he decided that they would send the ark first how many would like to put those challenges and just say Lord I'm going to put it on the word even now I'm gonna believe oh God tonight I'm I'm asking oh God that you'd you'd awaken this dormant Faith you'd make it active oh God that Lord when the word comes I can mix Faith with it oh God I'm believing in some of the frustrations disappointments I'm believing that these are victories coming and I'm going to stand right there with perfect Faith that's on your heart today would you just pray with me and let's bring before the Lord cuz God wants us to have a Victorious Life he wants us to experience his goodness his power his promise the very wealth of his existence let us pray Lord Jesus as we come to you right now Lord just a little simple message Lord but Lord how if time would allow us we could go through even everyone in this room oh God and talk about the marvels of what you've done for us and yet time just continues it can wear us down the battles and everything uh that the devil brings our ways but Lord we want to raise up tonight in strength we want to raise up tonight and defy the enemy of the Living [Music] God we put a claim on these victories even now we're not going to let a disappointment become so disappointing that we believe we failed we're going to put it right there in the intercessor who's right there to work out our cause we're asking oh God be an active God in our lives bring forth the victory raise our faith up may we not turn one iota from believing and may there be great testimony to come from the challenges that are in our lives may we be conscious when we leave this room may we be conscious that there's a living God going with us helping us overcome helping us become the solution to a Fallen World condition may it be so God I pray you just strengthen every heart every mind and as the days are getting dark May the light be getting greater in us we believe you'll do it now for the glory in Jesus Christ Christ's name we pray amen amen we've been made more conquerors invite your pastor be happy to pray for anybody oh we've been made more than [Music] coner Overcomers in this BL Hallelujah [Music]
