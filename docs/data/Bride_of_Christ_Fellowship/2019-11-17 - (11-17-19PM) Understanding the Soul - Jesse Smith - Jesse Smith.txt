worse [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's go to first Peter chapter 1 here I can look at this all again we looked at soul first I'd like to look at same topic but no different thoughts understanding the soul okay I just got a text from brother bang so James is sick so they'll be live streaming awesome will read our text little paper bang verse 18 we looked at the soul a couple weeks ago I've been studying more into it starting to finally open up a little bit starting to feel a bit under better understanding you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot I want you to just catch that thought like redemption really never happened until the blood of Christ was shed so that means if you you know every sit every person member was kept in the prison house of Hell near it you know near it although it was called Abraham's bosom we know that but it was near hell because Satan had a ransom over them the Bible said the handwriting of the wall was against them so Satan had rights to them because he tricked Adam the Bible said of whom a man is overcome the same he's in bondage to yes so the soul of man under the Old Testament was not fully redeemed and so he had rights over those souls and that's why that which could call up the souls now they came up in theophany form you know but that's still part of the soul you know that theophany is the image of the soul and then that's that's really fresh to me now verse 20 who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for youth who by him to believe in God that raised up him from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God not in the church not in me not in brother branham in God our faith is in God seeing now here's the beautiful part where he breaks it down to the soul seeing yet ye have purified your soul see there's now we're getting to the free more agency like remember the Bible said remember Paul and Barnabas said save yourselves from this untoward generation remember that in other words there we can't save ourselves but what they're saying is use your free more agency and choose to repent and get saved so now it's saying you say you purified your souls well you didn't do it but you chose to allow God to do it see seeing you purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren that's sincere love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently I just wanted to catch that again see this is something I haven't got to yet but our souls are purified through the blood of Christ so that means church without without the baptism the Holy Ghost a soul is not truly pure yet see because they can still choose unbelief right it can still just a human element it doesn't have a divine element but once the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes down the Bible makes the Bible says your soul is now redeemed and it's pure because of the pure Holy Spirit's there but how do you get there through obedience obedience choosing obey choosing God's way God's will verse 23 here's being born again that means born of above being born from above not of corruptible seed see I have my dad seated me right but it's corruptible some day I'm gonna die I was born with corrupt seed but we're not born we're born again we're born from above of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever Oh glory there's a part of you and I that would live forever amen for all flesh is as grass see the Smith flesh the Li flesh janne flesh it's all all weathers away all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man is a glory of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you we get to hear it multiple times a week praise God that's that word of Prayer Heavenly Father we love you Lord God we'd give our last breath Lord for you and by proving it Lord we give our Sunday nights to you Lord we give our Wednesday nights we give all of our time to You Lord God because we love you and we thank you Lord for all you've done dear God we just ask that your Holy Spirit would be with us you're here lord help us to hear your voice dear God we love you Lord keep us humble in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen god bless you being seated praise God I do have a few slides there occasion I tried to switch over I think I used my iPhone so the first picture his brother Jason to Mars slide it's a little blurry cuz his file size was small I just kind of want to review it real quick he did a good job that's it's probably the best drawing I've ever seen of the soul and everything because you know your outer courts you know your flesh is out here oh I think I cut it down to I think he had the flesh as well and then he had the five like these five gates you know they're kind of like Gates or inlets okay and so the flesh had five of those as well was really nice to see that that that's how your flesh is contacted through the five senses but the spirit now is contacted through imagination it's contacted through memory reason conscience and then affection which is your emotions and your love whether strong love or strong hate and now the soul for a Christian it's only has one channel faith or unbelief you have to make that choice and that's what we looked at here tonight in our text and one not a beautiful text seemed like the Holy Spirit just directed me to that text right there about the soul now it's a little series we I don't know how many parts it'll be but I want to call this understanding the soul because it's helping me to understand it a little bit better by the grace of the Lord and I don't think I'll be an hour maybe if it maybe less so let's look to the word here now when we read our text beautiful text now I just caught that while I was I I need to go back and listen this to when I do when I write more on the chapter because the text said we were redeemed now that redemption that buying back there it is right there right see that's why brother Branham preached first and then he wrote the book next but see I'm trying to write the book and then priest I need to I need to go back and listen this big there it is right there redeem has bought back those souls had to be bought back and they're bought with the blood of Christ because he said I have to give my life as a ransom a payment for the sin debt of the world so there it is right there my thank the Lord so before that that's why the souls were held captive they were property of the devil because he tricked mankind or deceived Eve but then you know he deceit way he got Adam to disobey but really Adam was doing it as act of redemption but either way he forfeited the rights of obedience he forfeit it by disobedience and Satan had him bondage he was bondage to sin and death and all those things so we were never redeemed until the blood of Jesus Christ did away with all sin now what's interesting though church this something I've studied on but member Nathan told David after his sin with adults remember what Nathan said he said but God has put your sins from you he said God has put your sins away right so see God put him away but he never did away with them the Bible says we'll get to a little bit but the Bible said the blood of bulls and goats could never do away with sin okay so it's like a covering so it's like God had sinned he just put a blanket over and at least it was covered but it wasn't washed away it wasn't done away with because the sacrifice wasn't powerful enough i'ma show you the sacrifice of bulls and goats was powerful to some degrees right like we talked about with you know I can't pray son Enoch could be raptured through the the blood of bulls and goats Moses could park the Red Sea with the blood of bulls and goats amen that's powerful so there is power in that we know that but there was more power and that was the power to purify the soul praise God and that's what we should be seeking after now I just put a little picture up here I'll add more to it a little bit so this is all I've learned see so see before before this series this is all I thought this this was not there all I thought this all was just faith through I believe I even thought it was sinful and going to hell or saved that's all I thought and I thought it's either divine faith or not divine but I realized later now there's actually a human element there's actually a human part of your soul so it's a human spirit right just like your spirit and it's in the in the soul is the human freemore agency and program calls it it's your will your soul is your will or your desire to choose so the choice is here now I'll be bringing out this scripture later I don't have it right now but the Bible said that we must not do will worship I don't know I don't remember that from the New Testament but Paul said we must not do will worship and so si will worship would be worshipping according to your own will instead of God's will the brother Brahim said that's what Cain was worshipping under will worship he said I'm gonna worship I'm gonna do my I'm new I'm gonna worship how I want to worship nobody's gonna tell me how to worship God I'm gonna worship Him according to my will see it was will worship is my I'm bringing I'm bringing it although in my labor this is what I work for instead of doing God's will which was blood right he brought fruits vegetables beautiful beautiful sacrifice but it was his will not God's will so will worship means soul worship soul of disbelief or so of dis rejecting disbelieving God's Word okay so that's all new to me now let me explain this here this is my direction for this sermon I want to begin with first Peter 1 chapter 1 and I want to show God's imagery for the born-again soul is a ground and his word is the seed so I always looked at Jesus parable as just the human spirit you know Jesus talks about the four so or I'm sorry the sower that went so did he stood on four grounds right I've always looked at the ground as just the human spirit but now I see it as the spirit and the soul because the soul is just part of the spirit right it's not something totally different it's just the nature or the will of the human spirit it's a part of it okay so now I see that the Jesus or preachers could be preachers to throwing God's seed on every soul and the word see must fall upon every soul like Jesus parable either it begins to grow or snatched away right that's kind of what the parable is but here's what I want to show just as the seed can lay dormant for thousands of years right and even sinners recognize that so can faith lay in the soul without being quickened without fruit for years this explains a soul condition of the Old Testament Saints by faith they believed God their souls had chosen the word a lot soul was called righteous and rightly so Sodom sins vexed his soul or his will like it wasn't his will to see those guys surrounding his house right he's like why are you doing this wicked thing remember that I just read this that read that this week I'm starting Genesis 1 and I think I'm in chapter 21 now it wasn't his will like his that that fought against his soul those deeds just burned in his soul like why he got a honey gots around men like that why he got to do these things like that it was against his righteous soul but here's what I want to say it's kind of like the Old Testament Souls Church were like wintertime it's kind of like the seeds were just there but it's wintertime because they can never be quickened praise God amen you feel me I should say you feel peace you understand what I'm saying that's why I used to say to my friends you feel me I'm a little tired Zach still not up to my hundred percent so it's that I mean I don't have a scripture for that but I'm gonna look for a scripture on that I mean I think I do I forget in a little bit but it's kind of like in the Old Testament they could receive the seed of God but it couldn't grow yet because it the conditions weren't right amen the soul conditions weren't right and so I did you know I did some research here oops sorry I think click over so I did some research and you know Church how many what are the three conditions a seed needs it's got to have water light and soil right that's anybody knows that well so I compared it to what a sea needs what is a and so a natural sea needs water to grow well the Holy Ghost wasn't given in its power to the day of Pentecost right it didn't have the light and light represents knowledge according to Paul they didn't have the knowledge of the cross they're wondering what's the name of member they asked in proverbs 31 they said what's God's name and what's his son's name Amen they didn't have the knowledge they didn't know it was Jesus right they didn't know they knew there was a messiah coming but they didn't the knowledge of what he was gonna do right and the Bible said neither did saying cuz if he knew it he were not a crucified the Lord of glory I leave the light is not yet shine Amen oh my this is inspired and the soil was a good repent and good honest heart so see they had soil there it is right there they had soil they just didn't have light or water it wasn't the right conditions yet care I see that I'm giving Malachi good work out he's got to change the cameras when I walk up when I walk off the pipe he gets a good work out there now does that help that really help me Old Testament Saints could have the water on their soul since it came the day of Pentecost now of course he could fall on their their flesh and their human spirit but not their soul Jesus brought and Paul says this the light of knowledge of the true salvation through the cross amen it was through the cross that the Bible says the glorious light of the gospel the gospel is good news the good news is that God is going to take away all your sin through one sacrifice amen the blood of Jesus Christ is gonna undo all sin praise God that's the good news and the light had not yet shown so the seed couldn't bring forth he lay dormant so that's why I believe I believe Abraham's soul could receive the seed of God but it wasn't yet born again right as he received faith but it wasn't it couldn't be quickened yet and did you know God preached to Abraham did you know that did you know that all right go to Galatians you know that the Bible said God preached the gospel to Abraham I'll look it up here that was fresh to me yeah Galatians not it's a beautiful and that's why Jesus did you know God preached it to Abraham and then Jesus preached to Abraham's seed amen Jesus was God in flesh amen now look at this and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed amen hallelujah when Abraham got the visions from God God was preaching the gospel to him the good news all nations are gonna be best because of you your faith is gonna ultimately lead to the Messiah amen oh man how about that God preaching to us amen well he's the only real preacher anyway so who preacher this morning it was God Amen God who preached tonight the Lord Jesus amen if it's God's Word God's preaching amen I thought I'd share that that's beautiful now were weed free and stony free hearts are honest and good hearts according to Luke 8:15 that's glorious all right now now here here we are before here it is before the blood of Jesus the conditions for a new birth were unattainable see cuz those three conditions could not be met because of the weakness of animal blood animal will gut this is good watch this actually was good to me I hope it's good to you the animal blood could purify the flesh I mean though the Bible says that the animal blood can actually purify your flesh that's what the Bible says but not the conscience which is part of the human spirit so see let's go outside in animal blood can compare farther outside but not the inside so it could it could clean the outward part the third of it but it couldn't purify the last two-thirds every with me but the Bible said it couldn't purge the conscience from dead works thus the human spirit and soul can be purged by animal blood oh my let's read that if you got your Bible Hebrews 9 let's go to Hebrews 9 just so you can see it Church this is mad at my eyes I just study these it just it's really been opening up it's real been a blessing Hebrews 9 13 for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God amen praise God we'll get to some more scriptures stay there in Hebrews please here's the next one notice Church the conscious as is part I'm sorry not as part is part of the human spirit this proves the second part of zekiel threefold prophecy new heart new spirit my spirit could only happen through the blood of Christ that's why izq had to bring this out I'm going to give you a new heart a new spirit and my spirit because the blood couldn't even give you a new spirit because they kept remembering it their conscience was never purged from that amen but that means we brother anybody can walk away from our sinful life we can know we're forgiven praise God we can feel pure sister Wendy up here in our minds but they couldn't knew that in the Old Testament those still lingered on there because there wasn't power to do it but now we got power to purge our human spirit amen and our soul but see they didn't have that and I'll prove it to you by the scripture I'll prove it by the Word of God this could only happen through the blood and this means Old Testament States could not fully be sanctified enough to be filled with the Holy Ghost because the blood of bulls and goats could not purge them their conscience they always had this haunting guilt right they always had this guilt like I'm guilty I'm guilty and I can't believe I like Moses I killed that man you know I buried him in the sand you know they always had this guilt hanging around them I'll show it to your church even job was guilty all the time Joe even God caught him perfect but Joe still felt guilty aim ahead because God caught him perfect because I knew he'd met all the requirements but Joe felt it and Joe felt like I just I'm not close enough to God I'll prove it to you in a minute here because the blood of bulls and goats couldn't get him close enough amen but how much closer we should we be amen oh thank you Jesus if we just stay in the word now look at this now I will go back to see if your hopefully in Hebrews nine Hebrews nine nine which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience the conscience so the conscious is your moral compass and it's one of the five parts of the human spirit remember conscious memory reason affects your imagination so these scriptures say animal blood could purify the flesh but not the conscience it couldn't purify the human spirit let me read that read 1314 already yeah I think I did yeah I did now it seems I put it seems because that's as far as I am I'm not fully a hundred percent but it seems true it seems Old Testament sayings like job and David could never quite feel purged due to the weaknesses of animal sacrifices let's read it let's go to job nine now now we could read this whole thing it's beautiful but we won't just for times sake but if you want to read it go ahead I was reading it earlier this week job 9 verse 1 oh this is beautiful my hair right here praise the Lord oh my rich Lewis verse 1 job answered then job answered and said I know it is so of a truth but how should man be just with God now look God was saying he's perfect and job's like how can I be just with God hug the blood of bulls and goats couldn't make him feel forgiven verse 2 I'm sorry I read - I read one and - okay now I said for time sake skip down to 33 actually let me go to 32 for he is not a man speaking of God as I have that I should answer him and we should come together in judgment neither is there any days men be Twix us that might lay his hand upon both of us let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify me then would I speak and not fear him but it is not so with me oh did you catch it Jove is saying oh did you catch it Jove is saying how can I be right with God God is so holy he why is there some days Minh in between that can put his hand on God and put his hand on man and purge me and justify me and brother man said he was praying he was crying out for a mediator and that mediator is Jesus Christ amen because we have one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus amen and he's the one who comes between the gap praise God he comes between the breech and he puts his he stands between a holy spirit right and he stands between an unholy man and he becomes the sacrifice for man and brings peace peace between man and God amen oh that's glorious hallelujah but see is he's like wait I don't have a dais Minh I don't have a mediator and he did it that's true so see as perfect as many sacrifice as he offered church and never purified his mind because animal blood can't do that it can't purge your conscience all the way only the butter only the Holy Spirit can do that through the blood of Christ of course amen so 1st Timothy 2:5 there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus oh are you catching it tonight you enjoy this Oh hallelujah did i okay now building upon these words let's read David's words these are beautiful Psalms 133 song of degrees I don't think he's talking about PhDs I do you he's not singing about going to college and getting a degree verse 3 if thou Lord should have smart Knik WA T's Oh Lord who shall stand you think David knew about this but there's forgiveness with thee that thou mayst be feared now go to Psalms 143 verse 2 see he knew who is going to be able to stand God it has a mark of all these iniquities right verse 2 43 verse 2 and enter not into judgment with thy servant now this is David for in thy sight shall no man living be justified now look at this they're offering sacrifice member can't breach it every six steps 1 2 3 4 5 a kid he make it to 6 every six steps had to stop and kill a sacrifice to make sure the ark would could be brought back and they could have revival and yet still he says that he says who shall be justified before God 9 so see that they knew God was blessing them and they could feel clean their flesh but in their minds they never quite got the victory see because that anointing would come and go like just like it does ours right sometimes our minds are on fire for the Lord so now if you love thinking about meditate on the Lord sometimes we don't so these are the moments we catch the moments when their minds aren't always anointed see that please don't enter the judgment says for in your sight no man living should be justified because he realized I can't really be purged in my spirit my conscience nor my soul Wow now Romans 3:20 this beautiful 9 this some of these they're just I don't know how say it but just highlight scriptures of the New Testament they're just so beautiful they kind of summarize the beauty of the good news of the gospel Romans 3:20 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight now look at that man as much as they obey the law they could not be justified so much as a sacrifice as much as they obeyed they couldn't be justified for by the law is the knowledge of sin see the deeds of the law now these scriptures explain the lack of rest right Old Testament Saints were working doing the deeds of the law which could not justify the flesh so see their human their soul was not quickened so they received the seed the seed fell on their soul they believed but it wasn't quickened yet so the holy spirit wasn't actively his will wasn't active actively causing them to keep the word can I say like that because that's what zekiel said the Holy Spirit will cause you to keep my word amen God's will did it have wasn't active it wasn't quickened yet it wasn't active so the Bible said the soul then must witness the human soul was still working the still human soul was still doing the deeds of the law the deeds of the flesh now our law was a schoolmaster or a teacher to bring us to Christ the grace of Christ according to Galatians 3 so this was all to teach us to learn to rest to learn to trust in Christ to have our minds purged that's what our blood of Christ is all about he can he can undo all your past amen he can put it for under the blood he can do it he can give you a good conscience he can clean out your conscience so that you know you're right with God and he can he can quicken your soul he can birth your soul and make it alive amen hallelujah now also i read romans 326 since were there to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier him which believeth in Jesus see remember David said who should be justified and now Paul says we are justified by the blood of Christ amen because I believe that Jesus Christ is God's Son amen he died in the cross rose again I believe that and so God says you're justified now day man and I'll justify you I'll sanctify you now through the Holy Spirit and I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost amen now Hebrews 10 1 says this I'll just go cuz it's important to read that it's a important part of the lesson here okay now for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect it can never do it but yet God had him do it for 2,000 years right almost 2,000 years because Noah flood was 2,000 years then there's 2,000 years of the cross right so almost 2,000 years I think is 1500 years Moses got the law they tried to keep her they tried to keep her they tried but it never made them perfect because it couldn't make them perfect the blood wasn't pure blood right wasn't God's blood right we'd say now Hebrews 10:10 by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sin ah huh I'm so glad Church that I don't have to come to churches be like well I'm really not going to help the people today my ministry's not gonna help the people today but I can govern the New Testament say my ministry God can use my ministry to take the sins away praise God amen the blood of Christ or the blood of bulls and goats couldn't do that all their ministry could never produce this people all sins forgiven but today in the New Testament under the Melchizedek Priesthood we can preach and church we can leave here perfect amen Oh through the blood of God's own son Amen hallelujah oh thank God well the blessing is to know our labor is not in vain in the Lord Amen you can come in here feeling guilty you can walk out purged you can walk out clean you can walk off with a clear conscience Amen free from dead works and guilt and shame that's what the power of this bread does amen week after week month after month year after year amen see sins were covered but never taken away verse 11 and 12 yeah first of all but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God now verse 14 for by one offering you have perfected forever them that are sanctified hallelujah so see sins were covered but never taken away praise God they can never take sins away alright next and now the Bible says Colossians 2:13 and you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses amen this blood does away with all of it the blood of bulls and goats can never take it away but now it's taken all out of the way see Satan doesn't like that right Satan doesn't like for you to hear that all your sins are taken away they're not covered they're taken away praise God amen it's kind of the trash right you put your trash in your container right you everybody have a trash container at their house you got to push it out to the road or your trash is in there all week and if you open the lid oh man close it well at least at least that's how mine is how much curse maybe you got clean trash or something but our trash lays there covered all not but thank goodness for the trash man hallelujah thank goodness for Friday morning when he takes away all my trash amen that's what Christ did Christ came and then all this trash under the Old Testament all this trash it was just covered over its stank it was awful but the blood of Jesus Christ was our trash pick her up her and he took all the trash and carried it all the way praise God now we're clean now we feel clean and now we don't feel clean because there's no more evidence of any trash amen oh thank you Jesus there's no more evidence it's done take it away Oh hallelujah now it just says I'm not gonna go through this again but I just want to show again or just reiterate it's just it's your you know your sin your so is your will or desire or free more agency that chooses one or the other and I want to show the quotes but I don't actually don't have them ready right now so I have to show those later now I want to get to that this little thought again about soul rest so with soul rest it must be true that the Old Testament Saints could not truly have rest for their souls or else Jesus would not a preacher to rest in Matthew 11 right jesus said come unto me all that we're heavy laden I'll give you what rest to your souls okay so under the Old Testament souls could not rest they were seen so that now they just it was just their human will was just wanting to do something hit their human will it was their will their will their will yet they had faith but Jesus said I'm gonna give you rest they still labored spiritually in their souls somehow this thought connects to zekiel 36:27 states God's Spirit will cause you to keep my commands so see in the Old Testament they couldn't rest but now you can rest because now if in the New Testament God's spirits in your soul working through you praise God it's not it's not me it's God working through me praise God that's what that's what Ezekiel said and that's what they needed that's what Joel 1 that's what David 1 I want someone to come and put his hand on God and hand on me and give us unity and harmony in other words I want God to come work for me praise God amen and that's what the Bible said in Ezekiel my spirit will cause you to keep my commands you can rest I'll work my will will be done not your will done you have to try to work your way to heaven I'll get you to heaven that's right because that's where Jesus said it come unto me all that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls now here's the beautiful this ties it all together right here and it's beautiful why would Jesus say your soul needs rest cuz it says right here for if Jesus does Joshua had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken him another rest day another day there remaineth therefore arrests of the People of God so in the Old Testament they their rest was getting in the Canaan's land but the Bible said they remained the rest for he that has entered into his rest he have also cease from his own works as God did from his see when the soul gets born again the New Testament is no longer the sole doing its own will oh I want to do this I want to try to do this for God I want you that forgot no when the Holy Ghost comes in you let God do what he wants to do brings God amen jesus said I always do that which pleases who me know the father what should your life be what's your testimony be I don't do it pleases me I do what pleases the father that's soul rest they couldn't have that in the Old Testament they could obey and keep God's word to a great degree but they can never have it like the New Testament praise God that's right it has to be that way because that's what it says right here Jesus that I'm coming to give rest to your souls so you will stop trying to do it yourself all right and then think of the times I just read it this morning was it I was trying to get the second time Abraham lied I think he'd already had Isaac no yeah I didn't have Isaac yet okay he didn't have it yet but God had just visited him and changed his name and God visit him at the tent and he interceded then Abraham goes off and lies to his second king he lied to the Egyptian king and and the king of Emma's like why did you do this to me this was a dirty trick and God said still you're a dead man if you don't pray cuz he's my prophet now I can't wrap my mind around that but that's just God's favor right there Abraham was wrong he was deadly wrong but the Bible said God struck Abimelech house with disease so the women can have babies all because the man he took Sarah and was it and he didn't even know but God said I kept you from sinning from me but Abraham see he was doing his works right there's a good example he's doing his works well I'll try to spare my life now see that proves his soul wasn't born again he's he's already talked to God so many times right chapter 12 you look at it chapter 12 14 16 7 he's talked to God face to lip to ear and yet he can still go after talking to God he laughed at God one of the times remember that God said you have a sudden my Sarah and he literally laughed at God Amen you've had some dreams about Jesus Ryan and brother branham can you imagine laughing at Jesus in one of those dreams I can't but yet Abraham did he laughed at God in the dream and said am I gonna have a son from Sarah right after God said it to him and then God keeps talking to him and then he has all this and God said I'm gonna visit you next year and then he goes okay alright and then he goes down to Bimala and then he lies again he lies again after God tells him you're gonna be through Sarah and he let Sarah go with another man see because he wasn't born again he was still doing his own works and a Bimala Kassadin why did you do this he said we because I made this agreement with my wife that whenever we come around Kings that she's got to say she's my brother and I'm I'm her that I'm I'm her brother and she's she's my sister so he just stayed in his old ways doing his own works but the Bible said you and I got the labor to enter into that rest we need to enter in the Holy Spirit rest where God causes us to keep the commands amen in other words God causes us to do his will amen now stay like this sister Wendy I believe this God do whatever you have to do drive me to do your will our gods will more than I want my will amen that's the real soul of a Christian no matter what it costs let me do God's will not my will I don't want to work it for my own desires I don't want to try to work my own deeds and my own thoughts I want to yield to God that God's Spirit causes me to keep the word that's what the Holy Ghost is does that help by God's grace it's helping me it's gonna open up clear up more as we as we go down the road here Lord willing if the Lord tarries so Courtney Hebrews 4:10 the soul was doing its own works meaning its own will that's why David Church he can have I think he hadn't I can't members here seven eight or nine wives before Bathsheba I forget maybe it was less than that but then he had concubines and things like that but that's why he could commit adultery because he wasn't born again the soul the Bible said he despised the will of God so in his soul or in his eyes he looked out at the woman lusted after her and he didn't have that anchor in his soul to say no right cuz as a man he could have stopped the thoughts from coming right he could cast him down but he couldn't start to stop him from starting right but he didn't have that anchor to cause him to do God's will say no I'm not gonna go get her he didn't have that anchor he was still doing his works what he needed was the Holy Ghost but it wasn't available yet so God had mercy on him amen glory hallelujah but now in the New Testament now no matter what we see or feel whatever in our minds when it comes down to making the decision God is going to cause us to say no we're gonna keep God's word amen we won't commit adultery we won't do those evil things we won't murder we won't do these things why because we have God in our souls to cause us to keep his will and that's what we want hey man I want God to cause me to keep his way men that's the beauty of the soul in the New Testament does that help grace I hope soldiers I hope you're being blessed this is like this is fresh manna to me praise God I'd like one of those Eagles you know gather around the carcass just feasting on the the meat what do they call it when the Sharks all eat fast what's that called I feel like it's a feeding frenzy here tonight they use all jump in and everybody eat as quick as you can it's fresh to me it's fresh because I'm starting to see this is what it means now the next one I'm gonna close with this one so I'm gonna keep this screen up here till I close so if you hope it's a hope you like it hope it's a blessing I think I got one more after that yeah I got one more okay now have you noticed this church the Bible gives all these different descriptions of what happens in your soul your soul gets filled your soul gets sealed Jesus says you're gonna be in do with power or closed your soul gets closed your soul gets circumcised are you mature your soul gets born again and that's not even all of them that's the only ones that time to prepare there's other ones all right the other ones are like quicken and all these things like that so let's go through each one of these risks briefly how can your soul get filled it gets filled with God's nature because before it's just human but they meant it's just a human nature what is your human nature do lie get angry think evil thoughts right unbelief right but when you're born again now it's filled with God's will God's nature before it's just a human nature but God tries to give us a picture so it's like a vessel that needs to fill with water and that's the imagery God gives us now it's filled with God's God's nature not our nature our nature just yields to that nature right we take upon his nature his will that's the first imagery so when they got filled with the Holy Ghost what were they getting full with they were getting filled with God's nature God's desires and now that's what I put in the book that's what proves because the Bible says after the day of Pentecost I remember this but the Bible said they are one and one song Oh hallelujah see that how could they have one soul they had one desire churches if we all got the Holy Ghost that's what art is our be two to do the will of God it'll be with the Saints whether they do they stay in fellowship with the Apostles they broke bread their prayers together they fasted they did all these things that's the same thing we'll do if we've got the born-again experience so when people don't follow through with the word of God it shows they're not born again because when they got the Holy Ghost they were of one soul one desire one will amen second the Bible said your soul gets sealed oh my I'm sorry before that one let me go back did you know the Bible said that we are partakers of the divine nature and it was in the statute vervet man Peter so this is perfect brother Ram says your soldier nature and the Holy Spirit is God's nature and see by the Baptist only Ghost we partake of the divine nature Oh mats it's rock solid amen this this doctrine is rock solid nothing's gonna break this amen because it's God's Word that's second Peter 1 says we're partakers of the divine nature and Paul says we're like a vessel we must be filled with the spirit sanctified ready and meet for the Masters use he's the imagery of a vessel I'm gonna fill you with God's nature God's will now you do my will all right that's the first imagery second imagery is sealed or marked as God's eternal property now this is good because remember if you remember the mark of the beast remember the Ark of the Beast Cain had the mark of the beast everybody on teaches the mark of the beast is for all generations so see the mark of the beast is when the person crosses over and they keep rejecting God till God knows they'll never do it again and so God gives them over to a reprobate and now they accept the human they said I'm only doing my will which really is Satan's will yes Lucy they're marked because that word seal means a mark it means a stamp or an imprint and so every unbeliever down through the age has been stamped with that when they take the reprobate mind it's like a point of no return that sinners but see when Abraham received faith it he didn't take Satan's mark he received faith he was he was saved his soul received the seed of God's Word so he had faith but it wasn't quicken yet hey amen that's right and I hope that I hope that's a blessing as well yeah if Romans 1 you know it the Bible talks about homosexuals and the Bible said they because they did not retain the knowledge of God God gave them over to reprobate mind so God is working so hard saying just surrender your will to me just receive this seed but then they keep letting Satan come down like a bird and snatch it up right but God says finally okay if okay keep sending seeds but if you don't want it then fine I'm not gonna I'm not gonna force you so I'll give you over you can have Satan's mark and God says fine I'm not gonna try anymore all right that's the point of no return it also talks about in 2nd Thessalonians 2 9 through 14 the Bible said because they were they received not the love of the truth there should be damned by believing in unrighteousness and God gave them over to a reprobate mind okay so the seal is a mark it's your price God's your mark the Holy Spirit is a sealants you are God's property and I'll say like this it's also it also means to close up so a seal means to mark and close up and it's like close up like an envelope praise God so God takes the Holy Spirit and he seals up his will inside of you or will praise God that's the way I put it in the book there I think that's the best way to put that he seals it up and you're sealed to the day of redemption and as you and I will soon see in the scripture I like this unbelief or your will is sealed out when you get the Holy Ghost and God's wheel will is sealed in amen so it's marked and then sealed up unbelief is out Satan's lies are out Satan's stamp is out God seals it and it's sealed forever praise God unto the day of your Redemption Amen see because all the way since Cain either Satan's mark or God's mark Satan's mark God's mark see in the soul either Satan's with or God's will Satan's will of God but now the New Testament God said I'm sealing it it's a finished work this Satan's field only goes he's mine for all eternity amen amen his will is now my will oh thank you Lord amen Oh makes me want to shout take man thank you lord next the soul needs clothes with divine power so in other words we are naked or powerless without the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the Bible says Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee so before that he was naked with a power we'd say or he say absent of power he was lacking divine power Paul calls this the powerless old man Paul calls of the old man and then Paul says in Colossians 3 - 7 - 10 he said you must put off the old man whose works are anger wrath malice blasphemy and he said put on the new man which is created in Christ Jesus a man so you got to put off the old clothing right your will and you got to put on the new clothing God's will and his power God's will is power because God's Spirit is his or God's will is his spirit okay so some of these have some overlap but you see we have to use all the images Jesus uses Jesus uses filling a cup Jesus uses stamping and stamping and sealing an envelope Jesus uses taking off old clothes putting on new clothes and it all lines up with the will and then I like this one Paul says put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof in that beautiful the soul can put on the Lord Jesus Christ amen his spirit his will is your clothing it's your soul's clothing oh my thank the Lord almost done here thank you for your attention I appreciate it the next one is the soul needs circumsized and this means the unbelief option needs cut off and permanently removed on a new you so see we're born and we have ours as human will trying to work is trying to do its own will but that human element of it has to be cut off just like a circumcision we got to cut off that excess flesh you got to cut that off and then once it's cut off it's cut off forever praise God Paul said he that as a Christian as a spiritual Jew having the circumcision of the heart in the spirit see in the spirit which has to be the soul because it's in the spirit amen and the soul is the nature of the Spirit they couldn't have this in the Old Testament and the Old Testament had to pin you down and circumcise the natural male naturally but now Paul says now it's spiritual circumcision amen God's going to cut off your will your human desires because you don't want them anymore and then you're circumcised and you're a part of God's holy Covenant amen well thank the Lord Costin three three I'm sorry Philippians 3:3 in Colossians 2:11 say this we are the which worship God in the spirit and we have we have the circumcision of Christ my doctors not gonna circumcise us Abraham's not gonna the dad's not gonna but Jesus Christ is gonna circumcise our souls he is going to cut all your self will out of you amen because remember church the soul has to be in a place where it cannot sin anymore it has to rest from its own will it cannot do its own will anymore it's only gonna do God's will amen because if that soul sins it shall die the soul that sinneth it shall die but when Christ circumcised is off the will of man he circumcised off your will and now there's a that's left is God to LA man oh thank you Jesus and now the soul doesn't believe this believe the soul believes the soul cannot sin anymore oh that's beautiful praise the Lord alright boy that's the preaching along and I thought okay all right sorry now the next one and this would be the last one here the soul needs born from above now the word again in when Jesus said you must be born again in John 3 that word doesn't mean twice it means from above Jesus said you must you didn't say you might want to consider it said you might want to you might want to consider going the holiest of holies sometimes you might want to consider no he's saying you must go in there the veil is gonna be torn you must go into God's presence amen see a birth is a bringing forth a start of a new life your first birth from your mom's womb is your natural birth but Christ promised and required a heavenly birth for your soul saying you must be born again in the Greek again means from above your body birth on earth was your first birth through your father's corruptible seed but your soul's birth from heaven is another birth experience amen glory it's another coming form it another bringing forth through your heavenly father seed oh thank the Lord amen in first Peter 3 it plainly states being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth them by forever your body will die in perish but your soul live eternally because it is God's own life or his own seed and first John 3:9 this is beautiful says this and it's undeniable it says your soul cannot sin because it's seed life is from God a man who suffers born of God does not commit sin it cannot disbelieve because it's a seed of faith in the head it's a living see it's a living attribute of God's own spirit it's a seed of eternal life amen it cannot disbelieve anymore it only believes praise God glory for his seed remaineth in him for he cannot sin because he is born of God amen the Apostle Paul taught is flesh and mind sin but not himself his soul Romans 717 now then it is no more I that do it the seed of God but sin that dwelleth in me so see that's how we can say this this we're the soul that sinneth shall die well Christians don't sin in their soul and I'll go on record as saying this if you and I wait long enough on every question our lives God will give us the right way if we'll just wait on it he'll speak it to our soul because that's what the soul is there for the soul is there to choose the right or wrong way it's your own for your more agency but when you get born again it cuts off your will because circumcised is your desires and now you've only got God's desires and if you and I get on our knees like our brother saying and saying about and prayed about if we get our knees and shut the door you know God's gonna give us the answer because we that's all we can accept we can't he the Spirit will cause us to do God's will that's the beauty of the New Testament that we can choose to let God come in and God will cause us to keep his commands because God said long ago God said I just don't want to be in the temple he said I want to be in them I want to walk in them I want to talk in them before they speak I'll answer amen that's what he wants a man possession hallelujah he wants oneness with his children praise God hey bad mother he'd be wondering what he'd be it's amazing he want to be one with a person like me like a person like you but yet he does because you don't want to do your will you don't want to do Satan's will you want to do his will praise God he born again born from above so it can be born again a second time because it's a spiritual birth the first birth is natural the second birth is spiritual but in context Jesus said that this birth was not of the earth this birth is from heaven Oh glory and I love this church and then you come in like boat around said you come in with the baptism of all he goes shouting speaking slobberin speaking in tongues praising God crying screaming praise the Lord because the Bible says when God sent forth the spirit of his son in your hearts you started crying daddy daddy father father where we see it was God's God birthed you into the kingdom of God amen hallelujah thank the Lord that's why we're been said we got to be born again he said we've got to be born the old-fashioned way like the day of Pentecost amen when the spirit came in the sea it cut off it cut off them with the desires of the flesh and now God's desires and their nice act daddy I want your will I'm willing to pray for you I would do it you were all the time ah the gods my spirits crying for daddy I love you show me your ways let me walk in your way Oh daddy praise God let's say in our feet praise the Lord and because let's keep that up there just a moment of this your new birth you you become a new creature because just like when you're born it's like when we saw I saw my babies come out there are new creatures now Maya we have a new creature out here Lydia's crying Malachi his crying screaming I got a new creature right here well then Paul says when you're born from heaven he said therefore if any man be in Christ he's a new creature and you come out crying and snot and praise the Lord because your soul has had a new your real soul has been brought forth you're real you're your real will your real desires have been manifested in Breaux of course now old things are passed away behold all things are become thank you Lord that I could be born from heaven and that now I don't want to do Jesse Smith's will I want to pray and wait and I say father where do you want me to do about it well I make mistakes sometimes sure indeed we all do we all make mistakes from the mind or from the flesh but ultimately when it comes down and God's gonna show us what we should have done and the whole time it was accessible to us if we just would have waited upon it and listened to God in the still small voice of our soul you believe that the Bible says we are born again not of the will of blood not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God born again of the will of God God foreknew you'd love him praise God so he made a way you could be born again alright let's have our brothers and sisters come here to the the music here I hope that was a blessing was that okay oh my that was a refreshing to your heart that was to me that's fresh meat praise God I've I've never preached so deep on this I was telling brother Steven after service there I said I just I just rejoice in the Word of God that message thirst 1965 I was I'm about an hour through it just going slowly real through that has just changed my whole thinking on the soul to think whole time and is almost twenty years and the message of that one servant right there contains secrets that would help me understand the soul when before I just thought well it's only either either diviner or diviner lost if I'm lost but now we see free mower agencies their desires their wills their and that soul must have rest that soul must be circumcised must be filled must be born from above oh my what a blessing praise God how do I say Lord purify my soul maybe tonight race maybe it says Lord purged my conscience from Mike from any sin I've done raised God because that couldn't happen under the Old Testament they could kill and kill and kill they could pour the blood out they could sprinkle the blood everywhere and it only purified their flesh the church members can never walk out feeling pure but you and I can walk out pure you believe that because it's under a greater blood praise God it's under God's old blood let's pray whatever your need is our Father Abba Father can handle it for us your Lord we thank you again for tonight lord thank you for your word what a refreshing that Lord is my just opening here please Lord remind me to go back and listen this so I can write it correctly Lord that other people might understand these things Lord God your Bible tells us to grow in knowledge to grow in understanding your Bible says the spirit searches the deep things aim the Holy Spirit doesn't stay on the surface it goes down deep into the word yay the deep things of God the Lord of proves that we're not we're going to be complacent staying on the surface surface level understanding we're gonna press deeper and the things of God they take our roots deeper make us stronger make us live more holy so father I pray in Jesus Christ's name every listener today if they've sinned Lord they could confess it in their mind and perched and they could be perfect leaving this place in the name of Jesus I pray by the blood of Jesus Christ any person that needs our pray they'll receive a dear God and they can know that the Holy Spirit will come and take that trash away praise God it will just be covered over in the garage but he'll be taken away never to return what a beautiful time I'll never look at trash collection the same amen hallelujah not in Jesus Christ often the way that the trash collector could take all our sins away dear God and now we are perfect we are justified it's as if we never did it in the first place is there no evidence of in your gun it's been taken away hallelujah so Lord purged the consciousness of your people tonight forgive them Lord may they feel forgiven as they confess their sins Lord as I confess mine Lord God all those who have a need of it becoming this fountain Dillon blood and me arson purge and cleanse night Lord purify every soul through the obedience of the Holy Spirit if the souls are not circumcised if they're not sealed if they're not filled I pray you'd circumcise them fill them clothed them their gods seal them do what you must do Lord not be they surrender to you and over every soul be made ready for your coming you're gonna that's my prayer granite Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise God praise God let's sing a song [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank You hallelujah ready hallelujah let's shop thank you Jesus thank you Jesus let's shop Lord you're worthy no you were the Amen Thank You Don what a reality church all right David and Jobe couldn't understand how I ever be justified with God how can a man stand Unforgiven before God they couldn't understand that but we can understand that praise God and he just takes it away let us remember that in the saw the soul cannot sin cannot sin the thing to do is get Christ in the soul get his spear there it will cause you to do God's will that's why those Matthew 7 workers of iniquity he said you're lost because you didn't do the will of my father there it is right there they couldn't do the will because their soul was not surrendered to God's will praise God could we see that they did miracles but God's Will was more than that it was to live a life of purity holiness godliness walking the holy spirit battling to stay in the spirit [Music] I just preached all night let's keep singing here by God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] I was hopeless I knew I was loved death the darkness without always I need someone to come rescue me [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]
