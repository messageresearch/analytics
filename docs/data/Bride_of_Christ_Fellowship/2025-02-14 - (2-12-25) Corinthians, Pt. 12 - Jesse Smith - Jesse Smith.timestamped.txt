[24:06] of my children reads the the Bible
[24:08] verses we want to go to 1 Corinthians
[24:09] chapter
[24:10] 8 this is part 12 on the book of
[24:13] Corinthians series
[24:16] here so 1 Corinthians
[24:19] 8 verse one I hope to get through
[24:22] chapter 8 and N know that might seem
[24:24] like a a large Endeavor but chapter 8 is
[24:26] kind of short and it's a lot of
[24:29] review uh as far as our preaching
[24:32] because it's very similar to Romans 14
[24:33] if you remember the Romans 14 uh
[24:36] chapters on Christian Liberties so here
[24:39] in the in the letter to Corinth uh
[24:42] Paul's getting into Christian Liberties
[24:43] here in chapter 8 1 Corinthians chapter
[24:46] 8 verse
[24:53] 1 and of course you know I'm not going
[24:55] to have everybody uh stand tonight here
[24:57] by God's grace of course we can honor
[24:59] the word by sitting you know in these
[25:01] type of uh special setting here by God's
[25:03] grace special
[25:05] circumstances but if we can let's just
[25:07] read verse one and then we'll have just
[25:08] another brief word of
[25:10] prayer 1 Corinthians 8 verse one is
[25:13] everybody there everybody here okay
[25:14] thank you thank you children okay let's
[25:17] begin on three one two three now as
[25:19] touching things offered unto Idols we
[25:23] know that we all have knowledge
[25:25] knowledge puffeth up but charity
[25:28] edifieth so let's have a word of prayer
[25:30] here father God we thank you for today
[25:32] thank you for these songs Lord thank you
[25:33] for the efforts of the people to do the
[25:35] live stream and my my children here
[25:37] thank you for their efforts Lord God and
[25:39] my wife upstairs helping Haven and so
[25:42] forth Lord God we're thankful for all
[25:43] the efforts Lord thank you for
[25:45] technology that we could be uh together
[25:48] uh in this format Lord God so we thank
[25:50] you Lord may your word strengthen the
[25:52] people here tonight as we uh get through
[25:54] this book lord God just guide and direct
[25:56] our thoughts Lord God
[25:58] Lord we know every word in here is thus
[26:00] sayi the Lord for uh it's good for uh
[26:03] edifying Lord God for strength Lord God
[26:06] for correction rebuke as second Timothy
[26:09] says Lord every word of God is inspired
[26:11] God breathed so Lord just minister to us
[26:13] here Lord through the uh this reading of
[26:16] Thy word the preaching of Thy word Lord
[26:17] God thank you God for uh speaking
[26:20] through us through the fivefold ministry
[26:21] God help me to be faithful here tonight
[26:23] Lord at my post of Duty and Lord May the
[26:25] Saints be edified by the word of God by
[26:27] the love of God through the word of God
[26:29] in Jesus Christ's name everybody said
[26:32] amen amen hallelujah okay so uh I
[26:35] probably have my children help me
[26:36] reading you know keeps them uh focused
[26:39] here on the word of God uh at home you
[26:41] know you can follow along here if you
[26:43] have your Bible stay right there in 1
[26:45] Corinthians chapter 8 like I said we'll
[26:47] try to get through 8 and N 8 is a very
[26:49] short chapter just 13 verses
[26:53] here uh by God's grace I am going to set
[26:56] a timer here so I'll set a timer for
[26:58] about an hour we'll kind of see if we go
[27:01] that
[27:02] long last time we looked at marriage and
[27:04] divorce chapter 7 so it's really
[27:06] interesting and neat to see how Paul
[27:08] goes from one topic to the other you
[27:09] know through this book uh we've already
[27:11] seen how he started off with a Believer
[27:13] standing in Grace and then you looked at
[27:15] the divided carnal condition that's
[27:17] something our church has been going
[27:18] through recently with uh um divisions uh
[27:21] caused by
[27:22] carnality um and so forth but by God's
[27:25] grace we'll overcome this we'll get
[27:27] through this and we'll keep praying for
[27:28] those all those involved um as it was
[27:32] foretold to us a spirit of tail bearing
[27:35] a spirit of re resentment okay and so of
[27:39] course that was probably what was going
[27:41] on in Corinth you know the the people
[27:43] around Peter they followed Peter they
[27:44] thought they were better uh than uh you
[27:47] know those following Apollos or or Paul
[27:50] or and then some said we're more
[27:52] spiritual we just follow Christ we don't
[27:53] need the
[27:54] preachers um but there was anyways
[27:57] divisions caused by pride and so forth
[27:59] so um we can see how some of these uh
[28:02] Bible uh conditions here from the book
[28:04] of Acts Church remain today uh evil
[28:06] spirits don't die right they just go
[28:08] from um uh an open vessel or willing
[28:11] vessel from one to another but let's be
[28:14] only open uh to the Holy Ghost by the
[28:16] grace of God we ask that here uh that
[28:19] God might be
[28:21] glorified I'm just seeing now there's
[28:23] comments I hope the comments are all
[28:24] positive I forgot to turn off the
[28:25] comments uh before I started so hope the
[28:28] comments are uh very kind and loving
[28:30] brotherly kindness in the comments by
[28:32] God's grace I try they kind of surprised
[28:34] me
[28:35] there okay so then we saw how Paul had
[28:38] to deal with sexual
[28:40] immorality um dealt with that and put
[28:43] the man out from under the blood and it
[28:45] seems like he repented it seems like it
[28:46] but we're not quite for sure but it
[28:49] seems like it through uh different uh
[28:51] historians and brother brandom even
[28:52] mentioning that too then he dealt with
[28:55] the sanctity of the body and marriage
[28:57] and now we're into this fifth part with
[28:59] Christian Liberties and it also ties in
[29:01] the warnings that go along with
[29:02] Christian
[29:03] Liberties um we'll see that mainly in
[29:06] chapter 10 but there are a few warnings
[29:08] here in chapter 8 as well by God's grace
[29:12] then when we get through chapter 10 11
[29:13] is on uh chapter 11 is on headship and
[29:17] the Lord's supper and then uh get to the
[29:19] spiritual gifts charity and then ends
[29:22] with resurrections the certainty of the
[29:24] resurrections and closing instruction
[29:26] and greetings
[29:28] so chapter 8 uh I'm going to have Al
[29:30] maybe I'll just start right here with
[29:31] Malachi and I kind of go down here so
[29:33] Malachi you want to read verse
[29:34] one now it's touching things offered
[29:37] under Idols we know that we H all have
[29:39] knowledge knowledge puffeth up but
[29:41] charity edify all right uh case you want
[29:44] read two and then we'll go with the
[29:45] Caris three and if any man think that he
[29:48] knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet
[29:50] as he ought to
[29:52] know but if any man love God the same is
[29:56] n of him all right so I want to look at
[29:58] a few thoughts on these F vers or first
[30:01] few verses by God's grace pardon
[30:03] me um here we see um a statement in
[30:06] verse one about we have all knowledge
[30:08] now he's relating to Idols so Christians
[30:11] have all the knowledge about Idols right
[30:13] Idols um are fake Idols have no real
[30:16] life Idols have no power but remember
[30:19] the Corinthians were a superstitious
[30:20] people uh so they were some of them a
[30:22] lot of them were coming out of this
[30:24] superstitious lifestyle you know even
[30:26] our our Mong friends in our church you
[30:27] know they talk aled about how there were
[30:28] superstitions in their country and some
[30:30] people still hold to those and no doubt
[30:32] there's even superstitions among um
[30:35] Americans you know even for example you
[30:37] know I told a friend yesterday oh we
[30:38] haven't had any uh sickness all winter
[30:40] they say oh you better knock on wood or
[30:42] you better make sure how you say that
[30:44] that's just ridiculous there's no such
[30:45] thing as
[30:46] superstitions um you know that uh the
[30:49] only truth is in the word of God right
[30:51] so we know there's truce but there's no
[30:53] such thing as these uh madeup
[30:56] superstitions but now Paul's talking
[30:58] about the knowledge we have of idols and
[31:00] some people in the church had knowledge
[31:01] that puffed up um and so you know as
[31:05] Christians we have knowledge we have to
[31:06] make sure we don't get a prideful
[31:08] attitude because of the knowledge that
[31:09] we have so that's what was happening in
[31:11] the Corinthian Church they had knowledge
[31:13] about idols and idolatrous temples and
[31:15] we're going to look at three of the
[31:16] temples in Corinth at least from the
[31:18] historical references that I was um
[31:22] looking up and there was some awful
[31:24] things going on in these temples but
[31:26] they had all the knowledge of of those
[31:29] temples um but some people would some of
[31:32] these Believers were still going to the
[31:33] temples just to eat meat or just to have
[31:36] a meal they were invited to these uh
[31:39] these worship Services we'd say uh and
[31:41] they would go eat it there and uh
[31:43] anyways they had knowledge and they knew
[31:45] okay these Gods aren't real so they
[31:47] thought well I can still go eat the meat
[31:48] it's a free meal you know it's a nice
[31:50] meal I I I could go for a free meal but
[31:53] that was Pride uh pride in them because
[31:55] they weren't aware of how the younger
[31:57] Believers around them uh would stumble
[32:00] at them going to these temples and again
[32:03] these temples were some of the most
[32:04] awful temples um you'd want to go to in
[32:08] those days kind of like a lot of the
[32:10] adult establishments today uh nightclubs
[32:13] and so forth like that as we'll get to
[32:16] so Paul says their knowledge was puffing
[32:18] them up U and it was different from
[32:20] charity so if they had charity with the
[32:22] knowledge it would try to edify other
[32:24] people build other people up strengthen
[32:26] other people
[32:28] so Paul says in verse Two If any man
[32:30] knows anything he uh these prideful
[32:33] people then they really don't know like
[32:34] if they're so prideful I know all things
[32:36] and I can do whatever I want and I can
[32:38] go wherever I want and eat the whatever
[32:39] meat I want I can go in any Temple I
[32:41] want doesn't hurt me you know Paul says
[32:43] then you don't know anything yet you
[32:44] know if if you're not thinking about how
[32:46] others are looking at your actions then
[32:48] you don't know anything you really don't
[32:50] have any knowledge right you haven't uh
[32:53] you don't have the character of the the
[32:54] Christ uh the Christ given knowledge you
[32:57] don't have character with that knowledge
[32:59] but love verse uh uh three If any man
[33:02] love God the same is known of him so if
[33:05] anyone has a love of God they're trying
[33:06] to edify other people they're always
[33:08] trying to strengthen other people you
[33:10] know uh uh you talk about people that
[33:14] you know some people around the message
[33:16] and all they do is they criticize others
[33:17] and say well you don't have the Holy
[33:19] Ghost so you don't know and that's not
[33:20] an edifying thing to say you know we
[33:22] shouldn't even if we say we have the
[33:23] Holy Ghost we shouldn't exalt ourselves
[33:25] above uh new Believers you know we
[33:27] should we should try to encourage them
[33:29] and say oh if you don't have the Holy
[33:30] Ghost well that's okay keep pressing in
[33:32] you know is there anything I can pray
[33:32] for you for you know you want to come
[33:34] down to the altar let's pray you know um
[33:36] we ought not to look down upon people
[33:38] well they just came in and you know uh
[33:40] but if you love God you're always trying
[33:42] to build people up right so that that's
[33:44] an a real attribute here of a person who
[33:47] is born again you're not trying to make
[33:49] others feel bad or or something like
[33:51] that or exalt yourself if you love God
[33:54] you're trying to edify others with the
[33:56] knowledge that you have and it's also
[33:58] good to keep in mind you know later on
[34:00] as we preached on chapter 13 earlier in
[34:02] this series Paul said though I have all
[34:04] knowledge without charity I'm nothing so
[34:07] again we get this idea you know
[34:08] Christians have much knowledge about you
[34:10] know uh the the godhead right uh
[34:14] remember that we preach that sermon the
[34:15] complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[34:16] because we have the Holy Ghost and the
[34:18] message of the hour we have the complete
[34:20] known revelation of Jesus Christ known
[34:22] through the scriptures and also
[34:24] prophecies and thus say the Lord
[34:26] statements from God's Prophet brother
[34:27] brandom
[34:28] um but we got to have charity to go
[34:30] along with that or else it's not going
[34:31] to profit us anything it's not going to
[34:33] help us edify other people build other
[34:35] people up help them on their Christian
[34:37] Journey right and we want to help people
[34:38] Along on their Christian Journey we
[34:39] don't want to um put a stumbling block
[34:42] in anybody's way that's what that chap
[34:43] that's what this chapter is about here
[34:45] by God's grace so I don't know how far
[34:47] I'm going to get now as I talk so much
[34:48] on these verses here so let's go to
[34:50] Victoria you want to do um well I'm
[34:54] sorry um I think I covered that uh yeah
[34:56] let me make it just a statement this
[34:58] week I watched um a testimony from Orman
[35:00] Neville's daughter her name is Linda so
[35:02] if you want to link to that let me know
[35:05] and uh Linda's like you know I don't
[35:07] understand everything about Doctrine she
[35:08] said but one thing I knew she was she
[35:09] knew brother brand brother Bram gave her
[35:11] the Christmas gifts the the oranges and
[35:13] the apples and the bags and called her
[35:14] little kitties and patted it uh you know
[35:17] patted her on the head and talked about
[35:18] how cute her uh her braids were you know
[35:21] brother brother Neville's daughter right
[35:24] um but she says I I may not know
[35:26] everything about Doctrine she she said
[35:28] or Mysteries and all these things but I
[35:30] knew the way brother brandham acted and
[35:32] the the humility that he had and how he
[35:35] was always loving people and uh edifying
[35:38] people he said there she said but
[35:39] there's so many preachers I I hear today
[35:41] that they try to strike fear in people
[35:43] and if you don't follow me you missed it
[35:45] and if you don't go to our church you
[35:46] missed it and she said I can tell just
[35:48] by a preacher's Spirit whether they're
[35:50] loving or not whether they are a real
[35:52] man of God or not and she said that's
[35:54] what brother brandom showed me and
[35:56] that's what my dad tried to learn from
[35:58] Brother brandom as well and so we we can
[36:01] always uh get a lot of wisdom from that
[36:03] you know the false preacher is always
[36:04] trying to put fear even brother B says
[36:06] that in the church age book you know a
[36:07] false preacher they're always trying to
[36:08] put fear if you don't follow me if you
[36:10] don't listen to what I say if you don't
[36:12] join my church if you don't send me your
[36:14] money you know they're always trying to
[36:15] put this sinful fear on people and
[36:17] intimidate people uh there's a
[36:19] difference between intimidation and
[36:21] being bold right we must be bold as as
[36:22] Ministers of the Gospel but um I just
[36:25] appreciate that I want to put that in
[36:26] there you know edify brother Ram was
[36:28] trying to edify the children brother Ram
[36:30] was trying to edify the adults brother
[36:32] Neville followed that example and so
[36:34] just that example of trying to lovingly
[36:36] edify other people will speak louder
[36:39] than your sermon will if you're a
[36:40] preacher or speak louder than anything
[36:42] you can testify if you're a sister or a
[36:44] brother uh your actions your loving
[36:46] actions speak louder uh than anything
[36:48] else right it's our actions that speak
[36:50] so
[36:52] loud remember Godly knowledge is a good
[36:54] thing if you look up that word knowledge
[36:55] knowledge is the third step in the
[36:57] statute per man you got to have that
[36:58] anointing so knowledge itself doesn't
[37:01] puff up but it's a prideful attitude
[37:02] that comes along with uh with getting
[37:05] God's knowledge if you don't have
[37:06] humility with God's knowledge then yes
[37:08] your knowledge will puff you up you'll
[37:10] think you're better than somebody when
[37:12] you're not right we're not better than
[37:14] anybody as far as our own human uh
[37:16] sinful condition something like that
[37:18] we're trying to overcome we can over
[37:19] over we can only overcome by the blood
[37:21] of Jesus Christ but we ourselves uh we
[37:23] did not earn our Salvation we have
[37:25] nothing to boast on we're only boasting
[37:27] on Jesus Jus Christ
[37:29] Hallelujah so uh we'll have uh Victoria
[37:32] you want to read verse
[37:33] four as concerning therefore and eating
[37:37] of those things that are offered in sa
[37:41] sacrifice unto Idols we know that an
[37:44] idol is nothing in the world and that
[37:48] there is none other but one very good so
[37:51] here's the knowledge that he was talking
[37:52] about in verse one Christians have all
[37:53] knowledge about Idols right the
[37:55] knowledge is an Idols nothing if you
[37:57] pray to a wood statue or if you you pray
[38:00] to your bank account or worship your
[38:01] bank account there there's no uh there's
[38:04] no virtue right there's no power in
[38:06] idols and we know all know there's only
[38:09] one God there's not two Gods three Gods
[38:11] there's only one God that's the
[38:13] knowledge that we have we have all that
[38:15] knowledge and we know there's only one
[38:18] God L do you want to read verse
[38:21] five for though there be that are called
[38:24] Gods whether in heaven or in earth as
[38:26] there be Gods many many read six un two
[38:29] but us there is one but one God the
[38:32] father of whom are all things and we in
[38:34] him and the one Lord Jesus Christ by
[38:36] whom are all things and we by him gra
[38:39] this clarifies it even more there's
[38:40] people that have gods in heaven gods in
[38:42] Earth Gods under the Earth they have all
[38:44] they have Lords here Lords there but but
[38:46] we know there's only one God that's
[38:48] father God right and then he became
[38:50] manifest in his son Jesus Christ God was
[38:53] manifest In the Flesh 1 Timothy
[38:55] 3:16 and notice just for our Trinity
[38:57] Aran friends that maybe try to criticize
[38:59] us bless you uh Paul notice Paul never
[39:01] mentions the Holy Ghost well that does
[39:03] that mean Paul's a two-person um uh
[39:06] believer uh in two two gods of course
[39:09] not um he's not bistic or anything like
[39:13] that uh he's he's monotheistic there's
[39:15] only one God right there's only one
[39:16] person in the godhead so he doesn't
[39:19] mention a third person in verse six it's
[39:22] because he was a monotheistic Jew and he
[39:25] knew the law could not change God would
[39:26] not change anything thing he said behold
[39:28] in Deuteronomy 6 Behold our Lord is one
[39:31] Lord hallelujah Jesus quotes that there
[39:33] in the gospels as well so Jesus affirms
[39:35] the monotheistic teaching from
[39:37] Deuteronomy chapter 6 about
[39:39] God and so we we see here that uh from
[39:44] the father are all things who of whom
[39:46] are all things so all things come from
[39:49] the father but they come from the father
[39:52] through Jesus to us right so we see that
[39:55] um by whom are all things and we by him
[40:00] so it started with the invisible spirit
[40:02] and then uh the word came forth out of
[40:04] the invisible Spirit the logos and then
[40:07] we came out of Christ right we were
[40:08] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[40:10] of the world as it says there in
[40:13] Ephesians 1: 4 and 5 and this reminds us
[40:16] of Ephesians 3:9 God created All Things
[40:18] by Jesus Christ the word of God we get
[40:21] that same idea here uh everything comes
[40:23] from the father but it's through Jesus
[40:26] right God created everything through
[40:28] Jesus so we see that uh we see that
[40:30] agreement there the harmony of Paul's
[40:33] letters one Revelation about one
[40:36] God okay verse seven I think we're at
[40:38] Malachi right Mali read seven M how be
[40:41] it there is not in every man that
[40:42] knowledge for some with conscience of
[40:45] the idol unto this hour eat it as a
[40:47] thing offered unto an idol and their
[40:49] conscience being weak is defiled all
[40:51] right very good so Paul Paul said not
[40:53] every Christian now remember he's
[40:54] dealing with a lot of Believers in
[40:56] Corinth now not everybody had that
[40:58] knowledge in the church okay and uh
[41:02] their
[41:03] conscience was uh
[41:05] defiled here so this is a very similar
[41:07] thought here to uh Romans
[41:10] 14:23 where it says he that douth is
[41:12] damned if he eat because he eateth not
[41:15] of faith for whatsoever is not of faith
[41:19] is sin so Paul is laboring on we don't
[41:21] want a conscience that's defiled as
[41:24] Believers we don't want to feel dirty
[41:25] right we don't want to feel condemned we
[41:27] don't to feel ashamed those are the
[41:29] worst days that we have is when we're
[41:30] ashamed we feel defiled and dirty and
[41:32] not right with God we don't like going
[41:35] through those type of days those are the
[41:36] worst days we have and so Paul's saying
[41:38] related to Idols uh if if some of the
[41:42] older Believers would eat meat in the
[41:44] temple it would cause the weak
[41:46] Christians their conscience to be
[41:48] defiled and remember what a conscience
[41:50] is the conscience is the morally uh
[41:53] right or wrong decisions that we make so
[41:56] our conscience tells us that's morally
[41:57] right or that's morally wrong so when a
[42:00] more mature believer would walk into one
[42:02] of those temples the young believer
[42:04] their conscience would wonder well is
[42:06] that right is that wrong and Paul said
[42:08] that's an awful thing to do to put
[42:09] somebody's conscience in a uncertain
[42:12] condition that then he'll say later
[42:14] you're actually sinning against Christ
[42:15] when you do that in other words we want
[42:17] to just be as as clear as possible to
[42:18] try to make things as as as black and
[42:21] white as they can be right uh this is
[42:23] good this is evil right this is true
[42:25] this is false and we want to try do that
[42:27] um and again while doing that we want to
[42:29] build people up by doing that okay we
[42:32] don't want to live in doubt or
[42:33] uncertainty we don't want to be
[42:35] double-minded uh tossed to and fro we
[42:38] don't want to live in condemnation we
[42:39] want to live in Freedom Hallelujah uh
[42:41] the truth will set us free right so the
[42:42] truth sets us free to do what's right
[42:44] and we won't Wonder all throughout the
[42:46] day well did I was that right was that
[42:47] wrong do I need to repent of that again
[42:49] should I be repenting every day over and
[42:50] over again it shouldn't be that way
[42:52] right we should just repent we know
[42:54] what's right know what's wrong Lord
[42:55] forgive me and then move on walk in the
[42:57] freedom right keep an eye out keep
[42:59] vigilant for the enemy he's going to try
[43:00] to come around with uh seven more demons
[43:03] this time so we got to be prepared to
[43:04] overcome him by the grace of
[43:06] God okay so we see that uh we don't want
[43:09] to make anyone's conscience weak and
[43:12] make them question is this right is this
[43:14] wrong okay we'll get to some more
[43:15] examples here uh soon by the grace of
[43:17] God now in Romans 14 uh Paul actually
[43:21] went through three areas you know
[43:22] vegetarian versus meat eaters he went
[43:24] through that in Romans 14 then he went
[43:26] through holy days whether you consider
[43:29] this day holy or not and then he went uh
[43:31] over meat as well and that's what this
[43:33] chapter is about but not just
[43:34] necessarily meat but it's actually meat
[43:36] eaten in a temple of a of a demonic God
[43:40] we'd say so with a bunch of demon
[43:43] worshippers we'd say so let's try to
[43:46] understand what these people were these
[43:47] Christians were doing in Corinth and
[43:49] remember these are some of the same
[43:50] people that were trying to sue people
[43:52] right in the church the same people that
[43:54] are trying to uh sleep around or getting
[43:56] drunk at the Lord's table well if
[43:58] they're getting drunk at the Lord's
[43:59] table no doubt they wouldn't as long as
[44:01] well they wouldn't feel bad going into
[44:03] the temple to eat some meat in a temple
[44:04] for a demonic God uh as we'll as as
[44:07] we'll see like Aphrodite or Poseidon or
[44:10] Apollo we'll get to those three temples
[44:12] here in a little bit by God's
[44:15] grace now verse eight UHA want read that
[44:18] but meat condemneth us not to God for
[44:21] neither if we eat we are the better
[44:24] neither if we eat not we are the worse
[44:26] thank you so eating meat doesn't give us
[44:29] favor with God or uh refraining from
[44:32] eating meat doesn't take away favor with
[44:35] God doesn't bring it favor with God I
[44:36] use this verse in my 2019 book about uh
[44:38] restoring Christian modesty I use this
[44:40] one to give me a definition of a
[44:42] Christian Liberty so Christian Liberty
[44:44] is something you do if I do it I'm no
[44:46] better off spiritually if I don't do it
[44:48] I'm no better off spiritually it's just
[44:49] it's one of those in between things
[44:51] where you God gives you some Liberty God
[44:53] gives you some options doesn't make any
[44:55] better doesn't make any worse whether
[44:57] you eat meat or not consider this day
[44:59] holy or that day holy doesn't make it
[45:02] any better you're no closer to God
[45:04] whether you do it or don't do it that
[45:05] ought to encourage us with the holy days
[45:07] right with uh especially the Christmas
[45:09] debate and so forth like that um or you
[45:12] know Easter whatever you know uh
[45:14] Resurrection Day you know um we have to
[45:17] remember there are Liberties as
[45:19] Christians and one of them is Holy Days
[45:22] okay now verse nine uh Caris you want to
[45:24] read that one but take he with by any
[45:27] means this Liberty of yours become a
[45:29] stumbling stumbling book to them that
[45:32] are weak very good so uh Paul says even
[45:37] though you have Liberty with meats and
[45:39] uh you understand eat meat eating is is
[45:42] not sinful uh take heed or that word
[45:45] means carefully examine in the Greek so
[45:48] just carefully examine your life as a
[45:49] Christian and make sure you're not
[45:50] causing anybody to
[45:52] stumble uh that would cause them to
[45:54] stumble into sin now we'll see why in a
[45:56] little bit as we look these temples what
[45:58] these younger Christians would have
[45:59] maybe stumbled into if they thought well
[46:02] that that message believer can go in
[46:04] there well if I go well surely then I
[46:06] guess I can go in there too but but they
[46:09] didn't realize what else was in there or
[46:11] maybe they realized it but they didn't
[46:12] realize that Satan was kind of drawing
[46:13] them in uh to give them an inch you s if
[46:16] they give Satan an inch then Satan would
[46:18] take a mile right and one of the best
[46:20] examples is wine as we've T preached on
[46:22] earlier you know you take a couple of
[46:23] drinks well pretty soon you're getting
[46:25] drunk and uh but it just started with
[46:27] one drink well one drink's okay well
[46:29] then I could have two and uh that
[46:32] Liberty becomes a stumbling
[46:34] block okay verse nine I'm sorry verse
[46:38] 10 uh where we at uh
[46:41] Victoria for any man see thee which has
[46:47] knowledge sit at me and the Idol's
[46:52] Temple shall
[46:55] not conscience
[46:57] conscience of him which is weak be
[47:02] emboldened emboldened to eat those which
[47:07] those things which are offered to Idols
[47:11] very good now this is this is maybe uh
[47:13] hard for us to understand but I think we
[47:15] can get some parallels here John Gil was
[47:18] a 18th century Baptist preacher and he
[47:21] he said it seems from what he read by
[47:23] history that uh in the Pagan temples
[47:25] they would sacrifice animals right once
[47:29] the sacrifice was over a feast was made
[47:31] of what was left so they would invite
[47:32] friends and invite people to come and
[47:34] partake of it and then some of such
[47:37] there were in this church would show
[47:39] their Christian Liberty and their
[47:40] knowledge of it and they'd go and sit
[47:42] down at the feast publicly so it seems
[47:44] like you know the Christians wouldn't go
[47:45] during the actual sacrifice of that
[47:47] animal in the Pagan Temple but they knew
[47:49] oh there's going to be a party and so
[47:51] they maybe they would wait around
[47:52] outside until they knew all the all the
[47:54] ceremony and rituals were over to the
[47:55] demons and then they would just go and
[47:57] get some meat right and sit down
[47:58] actually sit amongst these people um so
[48:01] that's that seems to be like one of the
[48:03] uh the clearest uh examples of that you
[48:05] know they wouldn't actually just be in
[48:07] there during the the sacrifice but they
[48:09] might come later and actually sit down
[48:12] on yeah yeah my friend invited me it's
[48:14] free food it's an honor to be invited
[48:17] but not to the house of the Devils right
[48:19] um but these are young Christians again
[48:21] these are the same people getting drunk
[48:22] these are same people suing might be
[48:24] sleeping around so these are very
[48:26] immature very
[48:27] immature uh carnal Christians that's
[48:29] what Paul even calls them babes they're
[48:31] babes in
[48:33] Christ okay and remember what kind of
[48:36] church this was a very immature church
[48:38] with many serious sins so think about
[48:40] that some of them were sitting in a
[48:42] demonic Temple so the equivalent I think
[48:45] it would be today would be like a bar
[48:47] these uh message Believers or they were
[48:49] they were so young or worldly they would
[48:51] actually go eat in a bar right cuz we
[48:54] know most bars in America the idols
[48:56] Sports right the Super Bowl or the
[48:58] basketball game that's the idols there
[49:00] or it could be they have you know uh
[49:02] filthy rock and roll up there or music
[49:04] videos going on who movies you know
[49:06] those are all Idols right those are
[49:08] those are just modern day Idols today
[49:10] whatever they go there to enjoy or it
[49:12] might be like a pool tournament right uh
[49:15] competition the idol of competition or
[49:16] something I don't know I'm just giving
[49:18] some examples I think a better example
[49:20] though might be an adult entertainment
[49:22] esta but I think that'd be like the best
[49:24] equivalent that I could think of uh
[49:27] because of the level of sin that was
[49:29] happening at these Corinthian temples to
[49:32] Idols as we'll see here in just a little
[49:35] bit so think about that they they claim
[49:37] to believe the message but they're going
[49:39] to the bar they're going to the adult
[49:40] entertainment uh nightclub or something
[49:43] like that they're basically going to a
[49:44] demonic Temple to eat and it's causing
[49:46] these younger Christians to stumble and
[49:49] say is this right what's right what is
[49:50] wrong what what is right and wrong and
[49:53] that was sinning against Christ and
[49:54] sinning against the younger believers
[49:58] okay they had all this uh uh sin going
[50:00] on uh in the church we've gone over that
[50:02] numerous times let's go to verse 11 is
[50:04] it
[50:06] Lydia and through thy knowledge shall
[50:08] the weak brother perish for whom Christ
[50:10] died okay now here I I put I read some
[50:13] different
[50:14] commentaries and so how could a brother
[50:16] perish from eating meat well it this is
[50:19] this could be some hyperbole Paul often
[50:21] use hyperbole just to make a point so
[50:22] did Jesus right he
[50:25] said he said if uh if your eye offend
[50:28] you pluck it out if your hand uh offends
[50:30] you cut it off it' be better to enter
[50:32] the next life missing limbs right than
[50:36] um than to go to Hellfire so this could
[50:39] be Paul giving
[50:40] hyperbole uh and maybe he's not
[50:42] referring to the brother losing his
[50:43] salvation or even dying in the in the
[50:45] natural but what he's trying to do he's
[50:47] trying to emphasize the damage that be
[50:50] can be done to a person's conscience
[50:53] right because the conscience determines
[50:55] good and bad
[50:57] so yeah so uh uh an older believer's
[51:01] compromise could uh cause the conscience
[51:04] of young believer to perish it's just
[51:05] totally destroyed right everything that
[51:07] was built up any any uh early teaching
[51:10] that was gained has now been all lost
[51:12] it's all perished because Paul still
[51:14] calls him a brother right he doesn't say
[51:16] he's going to lose his salvation he just
[51:17] calls him a brother um and he would
[51:20] perish so maybe die physically um uh but
[51:24] or maybe just hyperbole Okay so so uh I
[51:27] want to just make sure I say that here
[51:29] and then remember uh remember we must to
[51:31] remember Christ died to save
[51:33] us right we shouldn't uh we shouldn't
[51:36] cause somebody to stumble because Christ
[51:37] died for them uh not only did Christ die
[51:41] to save us he also died to show us right
[51:43] from wrong right he also died to bring
[51:45] us to maturity as Ezekiel said give us a
[51:47] new heart a new spirit God's spirit the
[51:50] three works of Grace justification
[51:51] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:53] I think we would all agree these Pro
[51:54] these people are just hardly Justified
[51:57] there's no way they're even partially
[51:59] Sanctified if they're still going into
[52:00] these houses of of demons to eat and as
[52:05] we'll see just think about all that's
[52:06] going on think about all these people
[52:08] just think about all the people you'd
[52:09] see in a nightclub think about all the
[52:10] people you'd see in adult entertainment
[52:12] you know just Place uh this all that was
[52:16] going on all that was there in the uh in
[52:19] the the Corinth
[52:21] temples so we want to make sure we're
[52:23] helping others to know what's right not
[52:25] to wound their we weak conscience but to
[52:27] help them know what's
[52:29] right okay and so knowledge with a
[52:32] prideful attitude it hurts your brothers
[52:34] and
[52:35] sisters um and prideful acting prideful
[52:38] like oh I can handle this and I can
[52:40] handle this Liberty and I've got all
[52:42] this Liberty to do that and I'll just go
[52:43] there anyway and who cares what the
[52:45] young what happens to the young
[52:46] believers um that that'd be a sinful
[52:48] thing to do uh we should always uh like
[52:51] like Paul said examine ourselves make
[52:52] sure we're not causing other people to
[52:55] stumble so remember the Bible lists
[52:57] these H these Liberties holy days food
[53:00] and wine now in my book 2019 book I also
[53:02] added I believe jewelries on an area of
[53:05] Liberty because in the Old Testament you
[53:07] have Believers wearing jewelry and then
[53:09] by the New Testament Paul's like don't
[53:10] buy expensive jewelry right so we have
[53:12] this area of Liberty okay and also as we
[53:15] pre as we preached the last few weeks
[53:17] there's Liberties in the local Sovereign
[53:19] church not every church has the same uh
[53:21] details for trustees deacons song
[53:23] Services song leaders right there's of
[53:26] Liberty uh in all these uh situations
[53:30] now I think the one that's most
[53:31] important is the wine for us um of
[53:34] course I never drink wine in public I
[53:36] never drink wine except it's at uh
[53:37] communion and just one sip right or
[53:39] maybe two if I have to finish the very
[53:41] bottom of the cup I try to even share
[53:43] the extra with the brothers there in the
[53:46] church now I think wine is the most
[53:48] dangerous as I mentioned earlier because
[53:49] a potential drunkenness and then any
[53:52] immorality that might result because of
[53:54] that drunkenness just with the words but
[53:57] also with the body like adultery or
[54:00] fornication um and that would be
[54:03] something today that would be on the
[54:05] same level as these Corinthian temples
[54:07] as we'll see here uh by God's grace so
[54:10] here's three temples let me just I've
[54:11] never preached this before this was kind
[54:12] of fresh so I was excited to preach this
[54:14] here tonight uh the Corinth had many
[54:16] temples right uh many a lot big
[54:20] population um but one of the temples was
[54:22] the Temple of
[54:24] Aphrodite uh it was on the hill
[54:26] overlooking the city so when you looked
[54:27] up that's what was the highest thing
[54:29] there in the city was this Temple to
[54:30] Aphrodite she was the goddess of love
[54:33] fertility and Beauty so you can imagine
[54:35] what went on there in that uh Pagan
[54:38] Temple okay so they had they had ritual
[54:41] prostitutions they would do the rituals
[54:43] they'd kill the animals right all these
[54:44] things and then these individuals would
[54:46] would do acts with prostitutes okay so
[54:49] that's why I said the the equivalent to
[54:50] this day would be like an adult
[54:52] nightclub or something like
[54:54] that okay so about that I'm not saying
[54:57] it was but it could have been where some
[54:59] of the Corinthians after all the rituals
[55:01] were done then they would go into the
[55:03] Temple of Aphrodite and eat meat and
[55:06] these young believers would be like do
[55:07] they what I mean think of the evil
[55:10] things that they knew was going on in
[55:11] they could hear they could uh they could
[55:14] probably knew about it remember I think
[55:17] the history was there was over 5,000
[55:18] prostitutes in the city of Corinth you
[55:20] know it was just a very lucrative
[55:22] business um and so imagine a a message
[55:26] believer going into the Temple of a
[55:28] Aphrodite uh it would just it would it
[55:30] would be an awful thing right and that's
[55:32] why maybe Paul says you're causing
[55:33] people's Faith to
[55:36] perish another one was the Temple of
[55:38] Apollo it was uh the major religious
[55:41] Center in Corinth and he's the God of
[55:44] Prophecy now here's where we're getting
[55:45] into something interesting music and
[55:47] healing so these people would Pump Up
[55:48] the
[55:49] Music uh and then they would give uh I
[55:52] just say like this like palm readings
[55:54] right false prophecies divination
[55:57] okay so here is the connection with
[55:59] false prophets Pump Up the Music they
[56:01] would try to get people healed through
[56:03] psychos symatic I can't even say that
[56:06] word but uh just Mind Over Matter type
[56:08] of things and not real healing because
[56:10] Satan can't cast out Satan right um and
[56:13] according to history they had did
[56:15] divination and they had non-binary
[56:17] relationships or homosexual
[56:18] relationships in that Temple that
[56:21] homosexual was prominent in the temple
[56:24] of Apollo now imagine new message
[56:26] Believers going in there to eat some
[56:27] meat after all that went
[56:30] on uh that would be an awful thing right
[56:32] that would be so incredibly sinful and
[56:35] Paul's telling them you know yeah you
[56:37] might have knowledge that yeah I know I
[56:39] know there's no such thing as Aphrodite
[56:41] I know there's no such thing as Apollo
[56:43] what what's wrong with eating the meat
[56:44] then you know I I get a meal out of it
[56:47] Paul's saying you should not go in there
[56:49] you're causing people to stumble because
[56:51] they know what else is in there and how
[56:54] can that be right to go in there what is
[56:55] right what is wrong uh causing people to
[56:58] stumble so it be like somebody a message
[56:59] believer saying oh I can go to the bar I
[57:01] can go down to the adult uh
[57:04] establishment just have a meal or I can
[57:06] just have a drink with with my friends
[57:08] there at the bar or something like
[57:10] that of course we know it'd be an awful
[57:13] you're going on the Devil's Ground right
[57:14] it'd be an awful thing to do getting far
[57:16] from God doing those type of things a
[57:19] third one was the Temple of uh posidon
[57:21] I'm trying to say that right he was the
[57:24] god of the sea earthquakes and hor es
[57:26] and again uh this Temple was known for
[57:29] much prostitution as well um and sailors
[57:33] and Merchants would visit this Temple to
[57:35] seek blessings for safe travel and trade
[57:36] so they would offer animals and they
[57:39] would go through ritual prostitution
[57:40] again to try to ensure they're going to
[57:41] have safe travel and no
[57:44] earthquakes um and all these things and
[57:46] then imagine a message believer going
[57:47] into the Temple of Poseidon and trying
[57:49] to have a meal sit down right next to
[57:51] some of these prostitutes or sit down
[57:53] right next to their friends and maybe
[57:54] the prostitutes are are next to to their
[57:56] friends or something like that uh if you
[57:59] have a friend like that that's not your
[58:01] friend don't hang around people like
[58:03] that that a real friend wouldn't ask a
[58:05] Christian to come in right that's not a
[58:07] real friend that's the devil anointing
[58:08] your associate trying to get you to
[58:11] compromise on the word of God right so
[58:13] any spirit that would draw you into you
[58:15] know worldly atmosphere whether there's
[58:17] worldly Idols or American Idols American
[58:20] Idols uh uh and all these Who's Got
[58:24] Talent and everything like that anything
[58:26] that's exalting the world and magnifying
[58:28] it you know the devil's just trying to
[58:29] get you to give an inch and then he'll
[58:31] take a mile he'll take you further than
[58:32] you want to
[58:34] go so here now we can see the context of
[58:36] some of these Corinthian temples and
[58:39] Paul's saying yeah we we know we know
[58:41] there's no such thing as posiden uh
[58:43] Apollos
[58:45] Aphrodite but when you go
[58:47] there uh you're actually associating
[58:49] yourself with them and you're making
[58:52] people question what's right or wrong so
[58:54] he says so he tells us his final
[58:56] conclusion of this chapter here by God's
[58:58] grace uh verse 12 uh Cas was that you
[59:02] H 12 but when you sin so against the
[59:05] Brethren and wound their weight
[59:07] conscience you sin against Christ all
[59:09] right so we get a good lesson here when
[59:12] you sin against another believer you're
[59:13] actually sinning against Christ well the
[59:15] opposite is true too when you do good to
[59:17] others you do good to Christ so we got
[59:19] to see that everything we do is really
[59:22] how we treat Christ right so how you
[59:24] treat your pastors how you treat Christ
[59:26] if he was your pastor right how you
[59:28] treat the song leader and how you treat
[59:29] the musicians or how you treat your
[59:31] sister you know that's how you treat
[59:35] Christ so we see our our our actions to
[59:38] everyone especially Believers is
[59:41] extremely important that's how we would
[59:42] treat Christ uh how we're treating other
[59:45] people we see that in Matthew 25:31
[59:48] where we have the parable uh Jesus said
[59:51] when you visited uh the prison you
[59:53] visited me when you gave food to the
[59:54] hungry you gave it to me
[59:56] um when you let a stranger in your house
[59:59] you let me in when you did to the least
[1:00:00] of these my brethren you've done it unto
[1:00:02] me so we see how Christ is manifested
[1:00:04] through his body of
[1:00:07] Believers okay uh Casa you want to read
[1:00:10] 13 wherefor if me make my brother to
[1:00:14] offend I will eat no flesh while the
[1:00:16] world standeth lest I make my brother to
[1:00:18] offend okay what a great conclusion what
[1:00:21] a great conclusion now this statement
[1:00:22] makes a lot more sense now that we know
[1:00:24] about aphrodites Temple Apollo's Temple
[1:00:26] Poseidon's Temple right Paul said if
[1:00:29] going there to one of these temples and
[1:00:32] I sit down there if that causes my
[1:00:34] brother to
[1:00:35] offend I won't eat any meat I won't go
[1:00:37] to any Temple while the world's standing
[1:00:39] so in other words for the rest of
[1:00:41] History the rest of my life I'll never
[1:00:44] do that because I don't want to cause an
[1:00:46] offense to my brother I don't want to
[1:00:48] wound his conscience I I don't want to
[1:00:50] make him weaker I want to make him
[1:00:53] stronger okay so we should take that in
[1:00:55] consider consideration every action we
[1:00:57] do especially related to Wine you know
[1:01:00] um and then the restaurants we visit
[1:01:02] that's kind of fresh to me there too be
[1:01:04] very careful which restaurant you go
[1:01:07] to sometimes people uh I I maybe not I
[1:01:10] better not go there I better pray about
[1:01:13] that by God's grace
[1:01:15] um so we got to be very careful uh
[1:01:18] modern uh entertainments you know
[1:01:20] anything uh with TVs movies and music
[1:01:23] got to be very careful uh where we go is
[1:01:26] Christians right because it could cause
[1:01:28] somebody to
[1:01:30] stumble all right chapter nine I'm 20 I
[1:01:33] got 25 minutes left here so we'll see if
[1:01:34] we can get through chapter nine here uh
[1:01:36] scoffield outlines this chapter in three
[1:01:39] sections verses 1- six Paul vindicates
[1:01:41] his apostleship so Paul gives them he he
[1:01:44] gives them their his advice about meat
[1:01:46] and and Idol temples and then he says
[1:01:49] well listen I'm an apostle you need to
[1:01:52] I'm your Apostle I was sent to you so he
[1:01:54] has to vindicate his apost apostleship
[1:01:56] to
[1:01:57] them and then he has to teach on
[1:02:00] uh why uh he doesn't take food or money
[1:02:04] from the people it's his way of a
[1:02:07] self-sacrifice to keep his sincerity
[1:02:09] with Christ and then verse 19 through 27
[1:02:12] the method and reward of the true
[1:02:14] Ministry Paul's true Ministry he's
[1:02:16] trying to vindicate to them now remember
[1:02:18] because remember Paul's against all
[1:02:19] these other remember he said you have
[1:02:21] 10,000 instructors but you don't have
[1:02:22] many fathers so Paul is standing in
[1:02:25] contrast to all these other teachers
[1:02:26] instructors that are allowing them to do
[1:02:28] that they're allowing them to get drunk
[1:02:30] they're allowing them to have divisions
[1:02:31] they're allowing them to go to the
[1:02:32] temple and eat meat so he's he's trying
[1:02:34] to say you got to listen to me I was
[1:02:36] sent as a as a apostle a missionary to
[1:02:41] you and then he says uh why he are the
[1:02:44] things he's doing in order to gain a
[1:02:46] Heavenly reward okay so we'll see that
[1:02:48] here by God's grace now I'm going to
[1:02:50] just I'm going to do a little more
[1:02:51] reading here verse one am I not an
[1:02:54] apostle am I not free have I not seen
[1:02:55] seen Jesus Christ Our Lord are not ye my
[1:02:59] work in the Lord so he gives them his
[1:03:01] opinion about not opinion he gives him
[1:03:03] the truth about Christian Liberties says
[1:03:05] I'm while the world's standing I won't
[1:03:07] go to that bar I won't go to that adult
[1:03:11] entertainment place I won't cause
[1:03:12] somebody to stumble they says aren't I
[1:03:14] an apostle isn't haven't I seen Jesus
[1:03:17] and all these other men in the church
[1:03:18] the preachers hadn't hadn't see that
[1:03:20] right they hadn't seen
[1:03:23] Jesus okay so Paul's asked them four
[1:03:26] simple questions Paul's author Paul's
[1:03:28] saying consider my authority I've seen
[1:03:30] the Lord Jesus Christ Paul wasn't
[1:03:32] allowing them Paul didn't want them to
[1:03:34] Paul wasn't giving them a license to sin
[1:03:36] Paul was telling them to live holy you
[1:03:38] have Liberties but make sure you're
[1:03:40] always edifying people and strengthening
[1:03:42] their faith and not causing their faith
[1:03:44] to be discouraged or uh
[1:03:49] defiled remember Paul started their
[1:03:51] Church by the will of Jesus Christ
[1:03:52] remember Paul was going to leave he said
[1:03:54] don't fear no man's going to touch you
[1:03:55] he said I have much people in this city
[1:03:57] and he was there a year and a half so
[1:04:00] Paul had to be persuaded by the Lord
[1:04:02] Jesus Christ to start this
[1:04:05] church now verse two if I be not an
[1:04:08] apostle unto others yet doubtless I am
[1:04:10] to you so Paul says other people might
[1:04:11] not think I'm an apostle but I surely am
[1:04:13] an apostle to the Corinthians for you
[1:04:16] are the Seal of my apostleship in the
[1:04:18] Lord right you're the very reason uh I
[1:04:21] am an apostle and uh you're the ones
[1:04:24] that I preached to and believed and God
[1:04:25] got saved Now isn't that interesting he
[1:04:27] could be there a year and a half and yet
[1:04:29] he'd leave and then look what would
[1:04:31] happen after he left they'd Sue each
[1:04:33] other they'd get drunk they' have sexual
[1:04:35] immorality they get puffed up about it
[1:04:36] they've had divisions they'd eaten the
[1:04:38] idols temples you think you would think
[1:04:40] a year and a half would have been enough
[1:04:42] but um maybe they had an influx of new
[1:04:45] Believers in there um don't don't really
[1:04:48] know about the early teachings Paul gave
[1:04:50] to the Corinthians but it seemed like
[1:04:52] they fell away because of those false
[1:04:54] teachers and false Apostles that came in
[1:04:56] there and spoke evil against Paul maybe
[1:04:58] they were persuaded by evil spirits
[1:05:00] right maybe of resentment or spirits of
[1:05:01] bitterness or uh spirits of
[1:05:04] jealousy something like that now verse
[1:05:07] three my answer to them that do examine
[1:05:10] me is this and I love this Paul says um
[1:05:12] I've got to answer for my uh accusers
[1:05:15] right
[1:05:16] uh now why didn't Paul say I don't have
[1:05:19] time to answer questions I don't have
[1:05:20] time for people that examine me nobody
[1:05:22] can judge me why I could care less what
[1:05:24] people think right cared because these
[1:05:26] were his these were his sheep right
[1:05:28] these were his these were the jewels in
[1:05:29] his crown so he cared he said I'm going
[1:05:31] to make time to give an answer on the
[1:05:33] people that criticize me and so from
[1:05:36] time to time I'll do that other
[1:05:37] preachers will do that now we don't want
[1:05:38] to spend all of our time preaching
[1:05:40] against the people that criticize us we
[1:05:41] got to move on and get back to Christ
[1:05:43] but Paul takes his
[1:05:45] time and he he he sets his time aside in
[1:05:48] this letter uh to clearly State why he's
[1:05:51] an apostle from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:53] and why they should listen to Paul so so
[1:05:55] he does have to uh defend his ministry
[1:05:58] his experience we know he talks about
[1:06:00] later in second Corinthians about being
[1:06:01] whipped uh uh five times being stoned
[1:06:04] numerous times Shipwrecked robbed all
[1:06:06] the time and fasting in prayers often uh
[1:06:09] so we see Paul does have to tell them
[1:06:11] his qualifications and his experiences
[1:06:13] to try to remind them why he's a genuine
[1:06:16] Apostle or
[1:06:17] missionary okay verse four have we not
[1:06:20] power to to eat and to drink have we not
[1:06:22] power to lead about a sister a wife as
[1:06:24] well as other Apostles and as the
[1:06:26] Brethren of our Lord and sephus or I
[1:06:30] only and Barnabas have we not power to
[1:06:32] forbear working so Paul's basically
[1:06:34] saying Apostles have the right to be
[1:06:36] married now the Catholic Church they
[1:06:38] must be uh they must be blind or
[1:06:40] something like that how can they not see
[1:06:41] this the Bible says Peter had a
[1:06:44] mother-in-law so Apostles have the right
[1:06:47] to be married they have the right to be
[1:06:48] served food because remember Jesus even
[1:06:50] told the apostles in Matthew 10 he said
[1:06:53] don't take a script right don't take a
[1:06:54] bag of food he said whatever they lay
[1:06:56] before you that's what you eat right so
[1:06:59] Paul said a
[1:07:00] preacher preacher can just go preach a
[1:07:02] missionary can go preach and and uh if
[1:07:05] they're a true servant the people will
[1:07:06] just feed them if if the whoever
[1:07:08] receives them will feed
[1:07:11] them um and then uh preachers have the
[1:07:14] right they don't have to work they can
[1:07:15] just give their time to fully to
[1:07:17] preaching teaching praying fasting study
[1:07:19] of the word like Paul said give yourself
[1:07:21] holy um they have all those rights those
[1:07:25] are are the rights of uh missionaries
[1:07:27] those are the rights of
[1:07:29] Apostles okay but Paul said I'm not
[1:07:31] going to use those okay verse
[1:07:34] 7 he keeps going he says who goeth a
[1:07:36] Warfare any time at his own charges
[1:07:39] which Soldier paid to join the Army none
[1:07:43] right they get paid to join the Army
[1:07:44] right who who pays to go die in a war
[1:07:47] nobody pays to go die in a war they get
[1:07:49] paid to go die or
[1:07:51] fight no Vineyard owner paid for the
[1:07:54] right to toil in the for the grapes like
[1:07:56] and not take any grapes right right
[1:07:59] that's what he says who plants a
[1:08:00] Vineyard and eats not the fruit
[1:08:02] thereof you don't pay money to go work
[1:08:04] out in the vineyard and then don't enjoy
[1:08:05] your grapes you you squash The Grapes
[1:08:08] you smash the grapes you get some grape
[1:08:09] juice and uh for communion you get wine
[1:08:13] right U they did it to get fruits and no
[1:08:16] Shepherd is pays money just to watch
[1:08:19] Sheep No a Shepherd get paid they get
[1:08:21] paid through the milk and the meat or
[1:08:23] whatever it would be Jesus said the
[1:08:24] labor is worthy of his higher so Paul's
[1:08:28] laying out the rights of Apostles right
[1:08:29] he's laying out all these rights why
[1:08:31] he's an apostle all the things he could
[1:08:33] do but again he's going to use this to
[1:08:35] show I'm sacrificing everything to show
[1:08:38] my sincerity and to keep myself pure and
[1:08:42] to show you that I'm a sincere
[1:08:44] missionary because remember they were
[1:08:45] doubting whether uh Paul was uh
[1:08:48] missionary they're losing confidence in
[1:08:50] him and he's trying to remind them right
[1:08:53] right the Bible say stir up your mind by
[1:08:54] way of remembrance is's trying to remind
[1:08:56] them of the truths uh of true
[1:08:58] missionaries in the apostolic age verse
[1:09:02] 8 say I these things as a man or saith
[1:09:06] not the law the same also so Paul's
[1:09:08] saying the Old Testament and New
[1:09:09] Testament agree on this this is a
[1:09:11] subject uh that uh had Flows In Harmony
[1:09:15] goes in Harmony from the old to the new
[1:09:17] just like the Ten Commandments I was
[1:09:19] teaching that at middle school this week
[1:09:20] and showing the the kids and you know
[1:09:21] all these Ten Commandments they're in
[1:09:23] the New Testament too like in Revelation
[1:09:25] 9 God or Jesus destroys lot the Nations
[1:09:27] for their Idols right God still against
[1:09:28] graven images and Idols verse 9 for it
[1:09:33] is written the law Moses Thou shalt not
[1:09:34] muzzle the mouth of the ox that tread
[1:09:36] out the corn doth God take care for
[1:09:41] oxen okay so U payment for preachers is
[1:09:45] God's care for them feeding preachers is
[1:09:47] you caring for God's servants who are
[1:09:49] laboring preaching singing teaching all
[1:09:52] that they're doing just like payment for
[1:09:54] soldiers if they're go fight for you you
[1:09:56] got to pay them just like grapes for the
[1:09:58] vineyard owner just like milk for the
[1:10:00] shepherd they're laboring so they
[1:10:03] deserve a payment right they're worthy
[1:10:04] of the payment Old Testament and New
[1:10:07] Testament agrees with it verse 10 or
[1:10:10] sath he it all together for our sakes
[1:10:11] for our sakes no doubt this is
[1:10:13] written that he that plowe should plow
[1:10:16] in Hope and he that threshthesky
[1:10:25] number right the four directions and all
[1:10:27] the fours that relate to the Earth um so
[1:10:29] he gives a fourth example a farmer right
[1:10:32] very similar to a a Vineyard owner uh
[1:10:36] There's Hope for the farmer if he plants
[1:10:38] uh wheat seeds then uh he'll get wheat
[1:10:41] back right um so there is hopeful reward
[1:10:45] for Laborers all laborers should have a
[1:10:49] reward verse 11 if we have swn unto you
[1:10:52] spiritual things is it a great thing if
[1:10:53] we shall reap your carnal things so Paul
[1:10:56] says it's not a great thing to be paid
[1:10:58] natural things for spiritual
[1:11:00] blessings that's not like some great
[1:11:03] thing oh we get we get we get love
[1:11:05] offerings if we preach or as a pastor
[1:11:07] gets tithes and that's not a great thing
[1:11:09] that's a that's a that's a normal thing
[1:11:12] that's a us that's an expected thing
[1:11:13] you're preaching you're laboring you're
[1:11:14] giving your life for other people to to
[1:11:17] preach God's word to them so surely you
[1:11:18] should be rewarded for that Paul says
[1:11:21] it's not some great
[1:11:22] thing it's not some unusual thing in
[1:11:25] every other area of life if you labor
[1:11:27] you expect and you have hope for some
[1:11:29] reward verse 12 if others be partakers
[1:11:32] of this power over you are not we the
[1:11:34] rathers know you let these false
[1:11:35] teachers and these 10,000 instructors
[1:11:38] you pay them right Paul says why not the
[1:11:40] real ministers right the real
[1:11:42] Apostles Paul says nevertheless he and
[1:11:44] Barnabas have not used this power
[1:11:47] instead they suffer all things lest they
[1:11:50] should hinder the gospel of Christ so
[1:11:52] for them it would have hindered their
[1:11:55] walk with the Lord it would hinder the
[1:11:56] gospel of Christ so Paul was trying to
[1:11:58] show him he he and Barnabas we're
[1:12:00] different from all these 10,000
[1:12:01] instructors we're not going to take uh
[1:12:04] the offerings we're not going to take
[1:12:05] the tithes or anything like that if Paul
[1:12:07] was the pastor right we're going to be
[1:12:09] different we're we don't want to hinder
[1:12:10] the gospel like these teachers are
[1:12:12] hindering the
[1:12:14] gospel verse 13 do you not know that
[1:12:18] they which minister about the Holy
[1:12:19] things live of the things of the temple
[1:12:21] so Paul's quoting the Old Testament
[1:12:23] verses right uh the Liv priesthood there
[1:12:26] the aonic priesthood they lived off the
[1:12:28] tithing of the
[1:12:30] people he said they which wait at the
[1:12:32] altar are partakers with the altar now
[1:12:35] remember there's five Old Testament
[1:12:36] offerings if I'm not mistaken um only
[1:12:39] one of them the burnt offering that was
[1:12:41] the most extravagant that was given holy
[1:12:43] to God but I think the other four the
[1:12:45] worshipper and the priest could both
[1:12:47] partake of it if it was a meat offering
[1:12:49] a drink offering uh the priest would get
[1:12:52] a part of that too remember that's what
[1:12:53] Levi's Sons they were taking the fat of
[1:12:55] it the fat was supposed to go to God um
[1:12:58] so we see some connection there too that
[1:13:00] the ministers the servants the priests
[1:13:02] in the Old Testament they lived off uh
[1:13:06] the the the labors of the people because
[1:13:08] they were doing spiritual work and so
[1:13:10] they they benefited from the natural
[1:13:12] blessings of the people the
[1:13:15] sacrifices so I love this here here's
[1:13:17] the verse I use friends uh family anyone
[1:13:20] that accuses me of ties is wrong here's
[1:13:22] the verse you go to 13 and 14
[1:13:25] Paul quotes Old Testament you can even
[1:13:27] use course 12 and 11 too Paul says don't
[1:13:30] you know the Old Testament lived off the
[1:13:33] things of of the the temple Paul said
[1:13:37] verse 14 even so the Lord so Jesus even
[1:13:40] Jesus ordains which means arranges
[1:13:42] appoints gives orders commands that they
[1:13:46] which preach the gospel should live of
[1:13:48] the Gospel so Paul says it's set up the
[1:13:50] same in the Old Testament New Testament
[1:13:51] so we know tithes and
[1:13:53] offerings um and remember those Old
[1:13:55] Testament they could they could they
[1:13:56] could convert an animal into money right
[1:13:58] because it's such a long distance they
[1:14:00] could do that there scriptures on that
[1:14:02] so today if we don't have if we're not
[1:14:04] Agricultural Society well surely we can
[1:14:06] convert you know we can give just money
[1:14:08] right that's a of course that's just how
[1:14:10] our uh society's ordained and set up
[1:14:12] like that but I want you to see Jesus
[1:14:15] Christ ordained ties and offerings here
[1:14:18] ties for the Ministers of course the
[1:14:21] pastors and anyone yeah even
[1:14:23] missionaries you know it wouldn't be the
[1:14:24] ti then uh it would be just offerings
[1:14:27] then to feed the missionaries feed the
[1:14:29] evangelists right um and do all
[1:14:32] that verse 15 but I have used none of
[1:14:35] these things so Paul said I'm going to
[1:14:37] I'm different than these other uh
[1:14:39] preachers all the even true preachers
[1:14:41] have the right to do this but I've not
[1:14:44] neither have I written these things that
[1:14:45] it should be done so unto me I'm not
[1:14:47] writing this so I can get money I'm not
[1:14:48] writing this so I can get more love
[1:14:50] offerings or something like that for if
[1:14:53] it were better for me to die that than
[1:14:55] that any man should make my gloring void
[1:14:57] so Paul says to me I'd rather die than
[1:15:00] be like these other false preachers I
[1:15:02] don't want to be like them at all uh I
[1:15:05] don't want to I don't want to put a
[1:15:06] burden on the people I don't I don't
[1:15:08] want my testimony to look anything like
[1:15:11] them so uh Paul and Paul says this is my
[1:15:14] glory so Paul says I I feel led to live
[1:15:17] this way so I'll get a reward in heaven
[1:15:20] right that's what he's saying my glor he
[1:15:21] was gloring in this he was rejoicing in
[1:15:23] this that yes God's G me enough strength
[1:15:25] I can go into a city I can just work
[1:15:26] work work work work I don't have to take
[1:15:28] anybody's money I don't have to take
[1:15:29] anybody's food Paul said this is this is
[1:15:33] this is what I want to live for I'd
[1:15:35] rather die uh than have to take money
[1:15:38] from the people and act like these other
[1:15:41] uh instructors or these false
[1:15:44] Apostles verse 16 for though I preach
[1:15:46] the gospel I have nothing to Glory of
[1:15:48] see because he was called to the gospel
[1:15:50] he was called remember Jesus said uh
[1:15:53] Jesus said you must suffer many things
[1:15:55] you must go to the Gentiles you'll be a
[1:15:57] light to the
[1:15:59] Gentiles and then and notice he says
[1:16:01] right here for necessity is laid upon me
[1:16:03] Jesus put the necessity of this on him
[1:16:05] he says woe unto me if I don't preach
[1:16:07] the gospel because Jesus ordained it
[1:16:10] right uh so he says in one way I don't
[1:16:13] have I don't have Glory over the fact
[1:16:14] that I'm
[1:16:15] called I Paul didn't ask to be a apostle
[1:16:19] Jesus ordained Jesus set it up that's
[1:16:22] what Paul's saying here if I don't woe
[1:16:24] is me I'm going to suffer I'm going to
[1:16:26] go through awful times if I neglect the
[1:16:28] calling and I have nothing to glory in
[1:16:30] this I didn't I didn't ask to be a
[1:16:32] preacher I didn't ask to be an apostle
[1:16:34] right and so that's kind of that's how
[1:16:35] every preacher should be that they
[1:16:36] didn't ask to to be a preacher they were
[1:16:39] called to it by the leadership of the
[1:16:40] Holy Spirit then God will vindicate
[1:16:42] right as we said a gift will make room
[1:16:44] for somebody who's really
[1:16:46] called verse
[1:16:51] 17 Paul says verse 17 for if I do this
[1:16:54] thing willly willingly I have a reward
[1:16:55] now that's referring to like what Jesus
[1:16:57] said about a unic remember Jesus said a
[1:16:58] unic some are called from their womb
[1:17:00] mother's womb others are made Unix you
[1:17:02] know and so Paul's saying if I just did
[1:17:04] this without Jesus's call as far as like
[1:17:08] a vision and all these things then I'd
[1:17:09] have a reward for that he said but if
[1:17:12] against my will a dispensation of the
[1:17:14] gospel's been committed to me in other
[1:17:15] words Paul's saying I didn't ask for
[1:17:17] this Jesus gave me this Jesus committed
[1:17:21] the gospel to the Gentiles to me right
[1:17:25] uh he just didn't saywell I kind of feel
[1:17:27] led to preach no he had Jesus visit him
[1:17:30] we'd say uh face to face or theophany to
[1:17:33] face right or Vision to face right um
[1:17:37] and so Paul's laying this out here you
[1:17:38] know so he's saying this is one thing I
[1:17:40] can glory in I can glory in the fact
[1:17:42] that I can be different I can sacrifice
[1:17:44] I can be a servant rather than um rather
[1:17:47] than act like these instructors these
[1:17:49] 10,000 instructors in the Corinthian
[1:17:51] Church that were leading them astray he
[1:17:54] said but I I can't glory in the fact
[1:17:56] that Jesus called me and woe unto me if
[1:17:58] I don't follow through with Jesus's
[1:18:00] calling for my
[1:18:01] life Verse 18 we're almost done I think
[1:18:04] well yeah we got eight minutes left on
[1:18:05] the hour so I think we'll get done here
[1:18:07] what is my reward then okay so Paul lays
[1:18:10] all this out he said what's my reward
[1:18:12] then his reward was that he would preach
[1:18:14] the gospel and make it without charge so
[1:18:17] he's totally different from these other
[1:18:19] Corinthian preachers that I abuse not my
[1:18:21] power in the gospel so what does this
[1:18:23] tell us the preachers in Corinth were
[1:18:25] abusing their power in the gospel right
[1:18:27] like think of the sons of Eli I mean
[1:18:29] what think of what these preachers were
[1:18:31] allowing these people to do right Paul
[1:18:33] had to rebuke them Paul had to come like
[1:18:34] a father and children call them foolish
[1:18:37] children carnal baby or just babies what
[1:18:39] were these preachers allowing them to do
[1:18:42] so clearly they were abusing their power
[1:18:44] in the
[1:18:46] gospel uh so they were taking money
[1:18:48] taking all these benefits which are okay
[1:18:50] but they then they were teaching the
[1:18:51] wrong thing uh they're allowing all this
[1:18:54] dis order in the church no wonder but
[1:18:56] called it the Corinthians book of
[1:18:58] Correction they were so uh they needed
[1:19:01] so much correction it seems like all
[1:19:02] they needed was correction because they
[1:19:04] were so worldly so carnal so
[1:19:07] immature verse 19 for though I be free
[1:19:10] from all men yet have I made myself
[1:19:12] servant unto all so all these other
[1:19:14] preachers were remember Paul says it I
[1:19:17] think he said it earlier they're they're
[1:19:18] exalting themselves like they're kings
[1:19:19] they're acting like kings Paul said I
[1:19:21] got to be different from them I got to
[1:19:22] be a servant I can't be exalted myself
[1:19:25] like some king or ruler over them he
[1:19:27] said that I might gain more so Paul
[1:19:29] realized I'm not going to or I'm only
[1:19:31] going to win souls and with a real
[1:19:33] experience if I humble myself and make
[1:19:36] myself a servant uh to this people
[1:19:39] rather than make myself a king or a lord
[1:19:41] or some great big somebody some famous
[1:19:42] preacher right I got the only way I win
[1:19:45] souls is to show The Real Love Of Christ
[1:19:47] the real servant attitude and lifestyle
[1:19:50] of a real Christian
[1:19:53] preacher okay
[1:19:56] um so his reward was being different uh
[1:20:00] from these other instructors in the
[1:20:01] church that were no doubt off the word
[1:20:03] of God and he knew he'd get rewarded for
[1:20:06] that okay and then uh verse 20 here
[1:20:09] we're getting to this idea here where
[1:20:11] Paul uh he would he'd really take into
[1:20:13] consideration a person's background
[1:20:15] before he tried to minister them so if
[1:20:18] someone's a Jew he'd go he he' probably
[1:20:20] you know he probably used all the
[1:20:21] Prophecies of Jesus right from the Old
[1:20:22] Testament bring it that way if they're G
[1:20:24] how they don't know nothing about the
[1:20:25] Old Testament so they he'd bring the
[1:20:28] gospel the different way right if
[1:20:30] somebody's weak and uh you know they
[1:20:32] don't have a lot of faith already then
[1:20:33] he would just try to build them up
[1:20:36] right so depending on how each person
[1:20:39] was in the condition Paul met them
[1:20:40] that's how he would Minister them that's
[1:20:42] how he would try to win them to Christ
[1:20:45] okay so verse 20 and unto the Jews I
[1:20:46] became as a Jew that I might gain the
[1:20:49] Jews look at the book of Hebrews that's
[1:20:50] a great example how Paul became like a
[1:20:52] Jew also in the book of Acts he shaved
[1:20:54] his head he kept kept his vows he tried
[1:20:55] to get to Jerusalem for the feast uh he
[1:20:58] was trying to be like a Jew to win the
[1:21:02] Jews okay and to them that are under the
[1:21:05] law as under the law that I might gain
[1:21:06] them them that are under the law and a
[1:21:08] good example is where Paul went and
[1:21:09] circumcised Timothy in order to try to
[1:21:12] win some of the
[1:21:14] Jews okay because a Jew would not
[1:21:17] receive a a a gentile preacher because
[1:21:20] he wasn't circumcised he he had
[1:21:22] disobeyed the abrahamic Covenant or
[1:21:23] neglected the ab a covenant and yet
[1:21:27] Timothy and Paul knew you know
[1:21:29] circumcision is nothing circumcision
[1:21:31] again now is the area of Liberty but to
[1:21:33] them it was so important so Paul's like
[1:21:35] what would it hurt Timothy to be
[1:21:36] circumcised it wouldn't hurt anything
[1:21:38] right it's just a surgery and you got to
[1:21:39] recover but if that opens a door where
[1:21:41] you can win souls to Christ then it's
[1:21:43] worth that
[1:21:45] sacrifice okay verse 21 to them that are
[1:21:47] without the law as without the law now I
[1:21:49] love this um so some people say well my
[1:21:52] sinner friends I'm going to go out to
[1:21:53] the bar to win to Christ or I'm going to
[1:21:55] go out to the adult uh establishment try
[1:21:58] to win them to Christ but look at the
[1:21:59] next words being not without law to God
[1:22:03] so I'm aware of the law of God but under
[1:22:05] the law to Christ so I'm still going to
[1:22:07] keep Christ's word uh but I'm trying to
[1:22:10] relate to a gentile or a sinner who
[1:22:12] doesn't know the law I'm trying to
[1:22:13] relate to them uh but I'm going to O
[1:22:16] always obey the word of God I'm not
[1:22:18] going to try to bring them Jewish uh
[1:22:20] Traditions or maybe Jewish prophecies
[1:22:22] now maybe prophecy would help a gentile
[1:22:23] if they respect
[1:22:25] uh history or
[1:22:27] prophecy Paul's saying whichever
[1:22:30] whichever background they're in that's
[1:22:31] the way I've got to humble myself I got
[1:22:33] to I got to kind of remember their
[1:22:34] Traditions I got to remember things that
[1:22:36] they uh maybe things that they uh have
[1:22:40] been taught their whole life and I got
[1:22:41] to I got to bring the gospel in a
[1:22:43] certain uh Direction by the grace of
[1:22:47] God okay that I might gain them that are
[1:22:49] without the law okay verse uh 22 to the
[1:22:53] weak became I as with oh yeah I just
[1:22:54] thought of a good example there uh with
[1:22:56] in in the city of Athens in Acts 17 what
[1:22:58] did Paul do he started there and he
[1:23:00] started talking about their poems he
[1:23:02] started talking about their discussions
[1:23:03] he enters right into their discussion
[1:23:05] right and he uses some of their own
[1:23:07] poets or your poets have said we're The
[1:23:08] Offspring of God so there's a good
[1:23:10] example good amen hallelujah they were
[1:23:13] they were not Jews right but he was able
[1:23:14] to enter into their conversation bring
[1:23:16] something from a poet they knew but say
[1:23:18] the reality of that is in Jesus Christ
[1:23:21] and you got to repent of all your sins
[1:23:22] right and then some believe some didn't
[1:23:23] so there's a good example I was kind of
[1:23:24] meditating on that Lord give me a good
[1:23:26] example so I thank the Lord for that
[1:23:28] acts
[1:23:30] 17 verse 22 to the weak uh became eyes
[1:23:33] weak now here's where he's getting back
[1:23:34] to the eating the meat right from the
[1:23:36] previous chapter I've got to remember
[1:23:38] these people are weak so I even though I
[1:23:40] got the Liberty I got the knowledge that
[1:23:42] there's no such thing as these Idols
[1:23:43] there's no such thing as Apollo I got to
[1:23:46] remember I got to I got to minister to
[1:23:48] them I have to remember their conscience
[1:23:51] they're weak they can't handle that so
[1:23:53] I'm going to I'm not going to do
[1:23:54] anything that would cause them to
[1:23:55] stumble right they're weak I got to
[1:23:58] remember what do weak Christians
[1:23:59] struggle with and I I won't use my
[1:24:01] Christian Liberties uh if they're going
[1:24:03] to see me do it I won't do it I'm not
[1:24:05] going to cause them to stumble and
[1:24:07] that's how you gain the
[1:24:09] weak and I made all things to all men
[1:24:12] that I might by all means save some so a
[1:24:15] good example for us is uh it's just like
[1:24:17] how I came in the message right I went
[1:24:19] to Brother Craig and brother Brooks and
[1:24:20] they didn't say brother Ram said brother
[1:24:21] Ram said brother Ram said brother bam
[1:24:23] said you know so to someone outside the
[1:24:26] message like me I was outside the
[1:24:27] message they minister to someone as
[1:24:30] outside the message right but if someone
[1:24:32] like you now my children you all know
[1:24:34] brother Ram said brother Ram said
[1:24:35] brother Ram said so you know I might
[1:24:38] bring the gospel in a certain way like I
[1:24:39] might uh so quote from brother Brandon
[1:24:41] might help my children you know may
[1:24:42] might relate to them a little more or
[1:24:44] people out people that were raised in
[1:24:46] the message but someone not raising the
[1:24:48] message you know I was taught the Bible
[1:24:50] says this there's no Trinity and there's
[1:24:52] no eternal hell and I was like oh yeah
[1:24:53] that's right oh my goodness there's no
[1:24:55] women preachers really you know they
[1:24:57] didn't say brother Ram said there's no
[1:24:58] women preachers they said the Bible says
[1:25:00] okay well that made that spoke to me and
[1:25:02] then later where'd you get that oh God
[1:25:04] sent a prophet named William
[1:25:06] bradam so they became all things to all
[1:25:09] men
[1:25:11] right that they might win some verse 23
[1:25:15] and this I do for the gospel's sake that
[1:25:17] I might be partaker thereof with
[1:25:20] you okay so Paul wanted to partake in
[1:25:23] getting people Sav saved he want to
[1:25:24] partake in preaching the gospel uh
[1:25:27] winning people to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:29] he does all this for the gospel's sake
[1:25:30] he could minister to a Jew Gentile to a
[1:25:33] weak person to a strong person he can
[1:25:35] minister to all them all right almost
[1:25:37] done
[1:25:38] here I got one minute for an hour okay
[1:25:41] uh verse 24 know ye not that they which
[1:25:43] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[1:25:45] the prize so run that you may obtain now
[1:25:47] the Olympics were in Athens not in
[1:25:49] Corinth but Corinth had similar sports
[1:25:51] games just like every community in
[1:25:53] America's Got footb football basketball
[1:25:55] baseball track whatever um so they'd be
[1:25:57] familiar with this now Paul's bringing
[1:25:59] it down here a way they can relate you
[1:26:02] know all these athletes they run and
[1:26:06] they want to get a prize and they want
[1:26:08] to be the they want to be the best right
[1:26:11] so Paul says Paul says run that you may
[1:26:14] obtain like run that you're going to be
[1:26:17] uh the Christian who will be so close so
[1:26:19] in love with God so much like Christ
[1:26:22] right and this is why brother R said if
[1:26:24] there's going to be one person make it
[1:26:25] out of brandom Tabernacle the golden of
[1:26:26] rapture I want it to be me right brother
[1:26:29] said your faith isn't good enough your
[1:26:31] faith isn't strong enough if you don't
[1:26:32] feel that same way like I'm going to be
[1:26:34] that one or I'm going to be one of those
[1:26:36] if 500 people get raptured I'm going to
[1:26:38] be one of them right because you should
[1:26:40] have that attitude that's where he gets
[1:26:41] this I believe that's where he gets this
[1:26:43] from 1 Corinthians 9:24 run the race
[1:26:47] like you're going to be the one that
[1:26:48] receives the
[1:26:50] prize right like I would think as a
[1:26:52] Christian at least I could at least
[1:26:54] least I could get would be a bronze
[1:26:55] right at least I would get some type of
[1:26:57] a crown some type of a reward right you
[1:27:00] should have that attitude I'm going to
[1:27:01] get there's going to be at all those
[1:27:03] seats at the marriage supper there's got
[1:27:05] to be one seat with my name on it I
[1:27:06] won't be right in the middle I won't be
[1:27:08] the right by Jesus on the right and the
[1:27:10] left hand but I'll be at one of them by
[1:27:11] God's grace right and I'm going to run
[1:27:13] that I'm going live my life that way I'm
[1:27:16] going to uh try to be all things to all
[1:27:18] men uh keep the law of Christ in my
[1:27:20] heart and the law of the Holy Spirit and
[1:27:21] try not to cause anybody to stumble
[1:27:23] verse 25 and every man that striveth for
[1:27:25] the Mastery is tempered in all things
[1:27:26] Mal kind are talking about the gym and
[1:27:28] he's watching his calories you know and
[1:27:30] we got to watch what we don't eat too
[1:27:32] much sugar right because that will hurt
[1:27:35] your muscle growth right it hurts that
[1:27:37] so Paul's bringing this idea and look at
[1:27:39] all these athletes they're very careful
[1:27:40] they have much self-control in what they
[1:27:43] do in everything their sleep their eat
[1:27:45] their diet uh even their body how they
[1:27:47] treat their
[1:27:48] body and if they're willing to do that
[1:27:51] to obtain a corruptible garland that
[1:27:53] will wither away how much more should we
[1:27:56] be trying to be temper in all things to
[1:27:58] obtain an Incorruptible Crown eternal
[1:28:01] life Hallelujah we should also be
[1:28:04] temperate in all things that's why you
[1:28:05] should fast that's why you should pray
[1:28:07] that's why you should read your Bible uh
[1:28:10] that's why you should go to church
[1:28:11] physically that's why you should visit
[1:28:12] the sick pray for the sick uh help the
[1:28:15] poor right all these things keep your
[1:28:17] body under the control of the Holy
[1:28:20] Spirit keep it uh keep the anointing of
[1:28:23] temperance on you that temp the
[1:28:24] anointing of self-control over your
[1:28:26] bodily
[1:28:28] passions verse 26 I therefore so run not
[1:28:31] as UNC
[1:28:33] certainly so Paul had a Paul knew where
[1:28:35] he was running Church we're running to
[1:28:37] Heaven hallelujah we're running to the
[1:28:38] Rapture we're running to be the Bride of
[1:28:40] Jesus Christ the wise virgin that's what
[1:28:42] we're running for to be that wise virgin
[1:28:44] the wife of Jesus Christ so fight I not
[1:28:47] as one that Beth era we know why we're
[1:28:49] fighting we're fighting the devil we're
[1:28:51] fighting the good fight of Faith right
[1:28:52] and we and it's feels good to hit the
[1:28:55] devil right it feels good to overcome
[1:28:56] Temptation it feels good to break
[1:28:58] through addictions right it feels good
[1:28:59] when people are delivered from demonic
[1:29:01] powers and they're they're healed and we
[1:29:03] get testimonies of healings oh my it
[1:29:05] feels so good right we're not beating
[1:29:06] the air we know what we're fighting for
[1:29:09] verse 27 but I keep under my body so I
[1:29:11] beat my body I I chasen my body and
[1:29:15] bring it under subjection I make my body
[1:29:17] obey the word of God lest that by any
[1:29:19] means when I preach to others I myself
[1:29:21] should be a Cast Away
[1:29:24] so we've got to learn to be more
[1:29:26] self-disciplined uh Paul and Paul's
[1:29:28] using this again to say I'm a real
[1:29:30] preacher I'm not going to take your
[1:29:31] money I'm not going to stay in your
[1:29:33] house all these things and take all the
[1:29:34] benefits of your house I'm going to beat
[1:29:36] my body bring it under subjection I'm
[1:29:38] going to live a more difficult life
[1:29:40] because that will help me to know that
[1:29:43] I'm going to win the race I'm not going
[1:29:45] to be uh distracted by bodily passions
[1:29:47] I'm not to to be distracted by money and
[1:29:49] temptations of money or women or
[1:29:50] popularity I'm not going to be
[1:29:53] distracted by any of that and be totally
[1:29:55] sold out to the
[1:29:57] gospel all right so self uh discipline
[1:30:00] of the bodily passions is critical to
[1:30:01] being a witness to others Paul says that
[1:30:03] in other words we must be different from
[1:30:05] other
[1:30:07] preachers I mean I've had numerous
[1:30:09] people tell me you're remember that
[1:30:11] brother that visit with Austin he's like
[1:30:12] you're not like any other Pastor I said
[1:30:14] Amen to that I don't want to be like the
[1:30:16] other denominational pastors I want to
[1:30:17] be a totally different man who loves the
[1:30:19] Lord Jesus Christ is approachable can
[1:30:21] talk to them even some of the Saints in
[1:30:23] our church from other countries they say
[1:30:24] well you're not like all the Pastors in
[1:30:26] the other country I I take that as a
[1:30:28] compliment I don't want to be like
[1:30:29] everybody else I want to be what God
[1:30:31] called me to do and call me to be by the
[1:30:33] grace of
[1:30:34] God um even you know we had we even had
[1:30:37] one person leave their church and uh
[1:30:39] we've had two people leave church from a
[1:30:42] different from hours away some people
[1:30:44] even move in because they knew this was
[1:30:46] a church of discipline my wife knows who
[1:30:48] we're talking about um but then the
[1:30:51] person didn't choose to be disciplined
[1:30:52] right uh or they missed their family and
[1:30:54] move away or something like that you
[1:30:55] know so we have a reputation we want to
[1:30:58] keep that reputation being disciplined
[1:30:59] to the word of God we want to keep our
[1:31:02] body we want to bring our bodies in
[1:31:03] subjection to the word of God well other
[1:31:05] churches say oh it's okay for me to wear
[1:31:07] high heels it's okay for me to wear sexy
[1:31:09] clothes or it's okay for me to wear a
[1:31:10] little makeup or cut my hair a little
[1:31:11] bit trim my hair a little bit no we
[1:31:13] we're going to bring our bodies in full
[1:31:15] subjection to the word of God we're not
[1:31:17] going to compromise on anything by the
[1:31:19] grace of God we're going to pray fast
[1:31:22] give arms keep uh do a little bodily
[1:31:24] exercise because it profits you uh
[1:31:26] because your body is a temple of the
[1:31:27] Holy Ghost you're going to be careful
[1:31:29] where you go right and careful what you
[1:31:32] do when you go
[1:31:34] there because remember in the context
[1:31:36] these people were eating in uh eating
[1:31:38] meat in prostitution houses right so in
[1:31:41] other words they were going to the bars
[1:31:42] where there was prostitutes they were
[1:31:44] going to these adult nightclubs where
[1:31:45] there was prostitutes and actually
[1:31:46] eating meat uh around that type of
[1:31:50] environment so I'm closing with this
[1:31:52] Malachi can come here to the piano here
[1:31:57] I'm just going to close with this quote
[1:31:58] from brother brandom he said uh this is
[1:32:00] Corinthians book of Correction I was
[1:32:01] listening this today again to get my
[1:32:02] thoughts back on brother brandom's
[1:32:04] emphasis on the book of
[1:32:06] Corinthians um brother Bram said your
[1:32:08] virtue is what you're counted by you
[1:32:11] don't say oh Hallelujah I know I got the
[1:32:13] Holy Ghost because I did this Hallelujah
[1:32:15] and brother BR said you say that and you
[1:32:17] have enough temper to fight a buz
[1:32:19] saw right so brother I'm saying look at
[1:32:21] your Christian virtue are you kind are
[1:32:24] you just kind to people right or do you
[1:32:26] got a temper that just gets so mad at
[1:32:28] people right and uh or people can get so
[1:32:30] bitter or so lustful or so prideful you
[1:32:34] know no matter how much you shout
[1:32:35] hallelujah and that's what he's going to
[1:32:36] say dance or speak in tongues if you
[1:32:38] don't have the real character of Christ
[1:32:40] then you haven't really accomplished
[1:32:42] anything right like Paul says without
[1:32:44] charity it doesn't doesn't do anything
[1:32:47] brother said let me tell you brother it
[1:32:48] takes virtue that Christ respects though
[1:32:50] I speak with tongues of men and angels
[1:32:52] though I pour forth blood out of both my
[1:32:54] hands though I shout and dance in the
[1:32:56] spirit though I eat the word of God and
[1:32:57] I love it though I drink from the same
[1:32:59] spiritual rock that the rest of them
[1:33:01] does though I clap my hands just as loud
[1:33:02] as the rest I can clap pretty loud
[1:33:05] though I could cry crocodile tears no
[1:33:07] doubt we've seen people cry cry cry cry
[1:33:09] cry brother though I could do all this
[1:33:11] some people might be able to cry longer
[1:33:12] and louder than
[1:33:14] others but if that real genuine real
[1:33:17] Christian virtue isn't there to Christ
[1:33:21] you become as a sounding brass and a
[1:33:24] tinkling symbol so M no matter how
[1:33:26] emotional no matter how the
[1:33:27] circumstances or experiences I felt an
[1:33:29] angel I felt this touch and I I heard
[1:33:31] that voice and I no matter what you got
[1:33:34] to have the character of
[1:33:36] Christ brother said Paul was warning the
[1:33:39] Corinthian Church of this which it was
[1:33:42] all mixed up in all kinds of Fanatics or
[1:33:45] Fantastics right all the gifts they had
[1:33:48] everything operating but yet they had
[1:33:49] all this sin operating too I'm brother
[1:33:52] said I'm warning you for friends he says
[1:33:54] remember I will have to answer for you
[1:33:56] at the day of judgment and so will I
[1:33:57] answer for bride of Christ Fellowship at
[1:33:59] the day of judgment we saw it in Romans
[1:34:01] 137 and 8 Romans
[1:34:04] 13:17 brother says your blood won't be
[1:34:07] upon me he says no matter how loyal you
[1:34:09] are to anything else be loyal to Christ
[1:34:12] remember that as we pray so let's have a
[1:34:15] word of prayer here just playay I love
[1:34:18] him I love him because he first loved me
[1:34:20] let's pray friends here our family let's
[1:34:22] pray that we have the real Christian who
[1:34:23] wants the real Christian virtues right
[1:34:26] yeah we want experiences we want

[1:34:28] supernatural but we also want to keep
