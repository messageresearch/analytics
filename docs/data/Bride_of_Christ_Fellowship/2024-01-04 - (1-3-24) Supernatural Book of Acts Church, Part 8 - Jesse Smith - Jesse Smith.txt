[Music] you praise God Amen we'll just sing that one song here and by God's grace we'll stand for the reading of the word I was trying to practice ear this earlier so become a problem here I wouldn't drop anything let's go to our bibles if you have your Bibles let's go to Acts chapter 8 by God's grace we're going to um preach on um chapter I'm sorry chapter 8 it's part 8 also of the supernatural U book of Acts Series so Acts chapter 8 and go to verse 5 Acts chapter 8 verse 5 we'll read 5 six 7 and 8 of course you're welcome to read along with me if you'd like by God's grace acts 8 vers 5 6 7 and 8 verse 5 says then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with paes and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that City let's have one more word of prayer Heavenly Father we just ask God uh now that we've come back to the Heart of Worship Lord God that you would use this part of worship the preaching of your word to strengthen our faith Lord God and Lord just guide me uh to preach your word I want to be instant in season and out of season whether I'm preaching in the church outside in the parking lot Lord or here in my own home Lord we I want to be yielded to you Lord so may each person on the live stream be yielded to the Holy Ghost we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats if you'd like we're looking at Acts chapter 8 I have uh my notes up here on the screen so I'll be referencing these uh part 8 of the supernatural book of Acts church I'll set a little timer here just to kind of give me an idea how long I've gone here just want to say again we really enjoyed the fellowship on Sunday and um the wonderful food all the sisters and brother Vang made there U by God's grace in the time of a communion uh a little announcement there I did put the next um communion time uh on the schedule uh I think I can look at that uh yeah look at that now so we have Dennis McBride on January 21st Lord willing Saints that's the Sunday I might be down in Junction City January 21st I did text brother Dennis about that brother Irvin in Junction City asked me to come preach so um I definitely want to help them out and it would just work out I wouldn't have to invite another guest preacher um I could just go down and preach on January 21st and then brother Dennis could preach for the Saints here in akan so uh that's the January guest Ministry brother digs I'm sorry brother Ben Nado will be here on February 18th Lord willing then brother Diggs March 24th and the new one I put on there was the Lord's Supper March 31st uh we'll do the 3 pm uh communion service there by the grace of God um you know we were talking with some of the Saints today on in text and perhaps you know some of the germs got spread during uh communion on Sunday night or maybe during the meal you know on uh Sunday so we'll have to uh just uh keep a reminder you know that uh next time we have communion if anyone is sick or just coming off of sickness perhaps we'll do the separate cups we could easily do that for communion brother brandham did that of course just because of the size of brandham Tabernacle but um just in the effort not to spread germs um that could be a good option as well and then also you know I was also mentioning this you know um if someone's sick or just recovering from sickness um you know if you're still battling the sickness it probably be the best idea to stay at home um in order to stop the spread you know of sickness over these 17 years of Pastor you know our family and I'm sure numerous families have gotten sick um when uh people that are sick are just overcoming sickness you know come to church unless of course you know the person believes are going to get uh immediately healed during the service because we know the church is a hospital and that's true um but there's also a balance to that um as as as we've seen you know over these 17 years and Cam's church has gone through it you every Pastor I talk to you know they go through I heard brother Brooks say it um if if you're not sure you have faith to be instantly healed in the service then it's probably a good idea to stay home especially with you know colds and flu and perhaps Co or something like that so just something to keep in mind there U by the grace of the Lord and uh to seek the leading of the Holy Ghost uh with that then also April 27th Lord willing we'll have a singing concert with brother Brooks and brother Brooks will preach for us on April 28th so I believe that's most of the announcements there uh by God's grace okay so let's take a a a moment here we'll preach on uh Acts chapter 8 I have my notes up here on the screen my Bible here in front of me I'm going to turn that little screen off that was playing the uh Heart of Worship okay so just briefly reviewing part seven we looked at how uh uh the first three verses of Acts chapter 8 um Paul was the chief persecutor of uh the church at the beginning uh but God's grace was rich upon Paul and uh God was very gracious to Paul and then you know we saw how uh the persecution scattered the early church and some people might have thought that was a bad thing but actually God used it for his glory god was able to start more churches in other cities and of course that we learn a great principle there God uses trials um persecution in order to spread the word of God and we just saw how you know God spread all the six or seven preachers that used to be at bible Believers en Lin when brother Brooks was pastor and now we're all spread out all separate except Cam and Simon are together there by God's grace so here let's look at um the next verse you know we went down to verse uh four and then we'll pick up here with verse five uh by God's grace so verse 5 says then Philip went down to the S city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them now the first thought we get here is Samaria remember Samaria uh was a city that was despised by the Jews in Jerusalem and many of the other areas in Israel because Samaria had a lot of inhabitants that were half Jew and half Gentile and so we see that in John chapter 4 um Jesus went to the woman at the well in Samaria he had a need to go to her um and remember her worship she you know her worship with the Samaritans was different than we say the Pharisees there in uh Jerusalem and so Samaritans of course were despised the Good Samaritan Parable gives us that insight as well but I love this the Holy Ghost fell in Chapter 2 on Jews only and now the Holy Ghost begins spreading next to Samaritans and of course this is the great teaching brother Brown brought us where Peter was given the keys to the kingdom uh by Jesus he first took that spiritual key and the key was faith in Jesus Christ and the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh and that baptism brother Ram says unlocks uh Salvation in heaven right there's power in the name of Jesus Christ so faith in the name of Jesus Christ that Faith unlocks uh the door of Salvation Allelujah the Bible calls it Jesus also called it the key of knowledge in the gospels I don't know that scripture memorized but I know Jesus said it um the key of knowledge so the knowledge of the name of Jesus Christ unlocks that blessing of Salvation and deliverance um and then of course you know in Acts chapter 10 Peter would open uh well here we see Peter opening the door here to the baptism of the Holy Ghost we'll get to that here in Acts chapter 8 Philip does the baptizing here but then Peter has the baptism the key to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then Peter again has the key to the baptism of the Holy Ghost there in Acts chapter 10 at the house of Cornelius okay so this uh section here is uh Philip ministering in Samaria all right and then verse five I want to bring out a few thoughts out of here again and notice he preached Christ unto them and I was as I was studying you know the thought came Philip preached Christ Philip didn't preach Peter Philip didn't preach John and so the same is true today you know we don't preach brother brandham uh brother bram's not God but yet he was God's Prophet right um nor do we preach any other man We Don't Preach Martin Luther or uh John Wesley or uh William Seymour although we believe they were men of God we don't preach them the authority is not in the man the authority is in the god the God man the Lord Jesus Christ so this gives us the idea as as wonderful as a man Peter and John were later God's going to use them in this chapter the emphasis of the preaching was Christ Christ means the anointed so as preachers we must emphasize the anointing of the Holy Ghost we must look for the anointing of the Holy Ghost in our lives in our homes in our churches that's what we need now we need the anointing of the Holy Ghost uh to heal the sicknesses in our homes by the grace of God God is faithful Hallelujah and friends you know we get this idea he preached Christ so he preached the power of Jesus Christ uh and demons are not subject to any man but Jesus Christ because he because uh Philip comes into a demon infested area we'd say a area of high demonic activity territorial demons and we know this cu the scripture tells that you know that Simon the sword s were tormented them for a long time so this was a this was a demon stronghold but I love how God sends one man in there Hallelujah one man goes in there as begins tearing down the demon strongholds so uh demons are not subject to any name but Jesus Christ but remember demons do know the name of true men of God that use the name of Jesus Christ remember acts 19:5 the sons of ska tried to cast out demons in the name of Paul Paul and Jesus and the demons said we know Paul and Jesus but we don't know you um so we get the idea there that demons know the real men of God who use the name of Jesus Christ to drive them out and so we want to live a life so close to to Christ that demons have to recognize our prayers and the times we speak the word of God how we need God's grace for that every hour we want to live true to God we want to live faithful to God so then God can move in our service Services God can move outside the services in our homes and so we want to have such faith and such a Pure Life uh like Paul did where demons would know our names demons would know we serve the Lord Jesus Christ the Living God hallelujah I want to read a few quotes from Brother brandom the power of God 1955 brother Bram said have faith in God notice he didn't say have faith in me he said have faith in God oh my how the devil has to recognize the supreme authority of Jesus Christ not me so again what a great reminder for all of us just like Philip was preaching Christ not Peter not John he was preaching Christ so brother Ram said the devil doesn't have to recognize me he has to recognize the supreme authority of Jesus Christ he said not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind who I represent he has to mind who sent me here hallelujah so we must keep that in mind uh we we often feel unworthy and of course we we are we are we're not worthy the only way we're Worthy is our souls are are uh are anointed with the Holy Ghost we're forgiven right and Christ makes us worthy Hallelujah the soul never sin in the first place but our flesh and mind sin daily so our flesh and mind not worthy but the soul is worthy by the grace of God because the soul cannot sin the scripture says 1 John 3:9 I like what brother Ram says here Satan has to mind the believer when he is using the authority that Jesus G gave to the church remember he gave the authority to all the Believers in Mark chapter 16 lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so tonight uh if someone's sick in your home lay hands on the sick they shall recover by the grace of God and remember that Satan has to recognize the authority of Jesus Christ not our Authority so we come against Satan in the name of Jesus Christ here's another quote from 1964 the identified Christ of all ages uh June 17th brother R's praying he said now Satan you cannot hold these sick people any longer they are subjects of the word of God come out of them the sickness that's in their body torment them no more let them go free from tonight on we as a Servants of God that has been identified to confirm the word adjure thee in the name of the Living God Jesus Christ so we have the power to adjure Satan in the name of Jesus Christ he's the word made flesh Among Us come out of the sick people and let them go for the kingdom of God's sake and the Commandment given us by Jesus Christ the son of God Amen so friends we have that Authority we confess our sins and then we have the authority to adure Satan for the kingdom of God's sake for the glory of God so let's remember that tonight by the grace of God because we have the Commandment from the Son of God now also on this idea of preaching Christ I want to just say a few things about that wonderful quote Simon used uh from brother brandom he ended the service with it trying to do God a service from 1965 um brother brandom said so say I in the name of Jesus Christ don't you add one thing don't take put your own ideas to it you just say what is said on those tapes you just do exactly what the Lord has commanded to do don't add to it okay so um it's a beautiful quote again this shows the authority brother Ram had as a prophet he's saying some of the same words Moses said in Deuteronomy chapter 4 and we'll read that in just a moment um but the point I want to make to our church is um I use this quote in a video I did three or four years ago called not every word on brother Ram's tapes is thus sayth the Lord um and that's because um the brandom Tabernacle currently and some M message churches message preachers famous ones use this quote and both both groups groups say the tape Church movement and this uh the prideful message ministers movement both um both use this quote to say that the tapes are are the absolute okay so the tape players and then the preach some of the preachers say the tapes are the absolute and they go as far as saying every opinion of brother brandom is a Vindicated opinion because he's a Vindicated Prophet well that's wrong he's a Vindicated Prophet for sure but he said if my opinions aren't with the word of God then take the word of God not my opinions and then with his opinions he said I could be wrong so we see a prideful spirit that would say every opinion of brother brandham is uh a Vindicated opinion that's not true but um I want to just read a few points here about this uh quote so this this quote is spoken in the name of Jesus Christ so it's a very serious author authoritative statement but it's not but it doesn't mean what these two groups are saying uh it doesn't mean we can only be parrots and only say what the tapes say uh that's a form of idolatry that's exalting brother brandom equal to God or Christ and so we will not take that Spirit of idolatry we rebuke that Spirit In Jesus Christ's name Hallelujah um so we don't want to misunderstand this quote uh second uh brother random is just repeating what Moses said in Deuteronomy 4 1-4 and then 25 and 26 the charge was not to add or to diminish God's word God's word that Moses commanded them not every word Moses said and Moses was right when he said this God's people should never add or take away from God's commands and that's of course according to Proverbs 30:5 and 6 and for the New Testament Believers revelation 22 18- 19 so I want to read that Deuteronomy 4 here I'm going to keep my spot if you have your Bibles you can go there Deuter om 4:1 and now that I'm thinking about this would be a good uh scripture to highlight and make notes in my new Bible there um to remember brother Ram repeated what the prophet Moses said here and there was a quote brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord he said the spirit of Moses will be in this brandom Tabernacle within a certain number of days so I do believe that prophetic anointing uh was on brother brandham for a certain time period no doubt cuz here he's using he's actually using the same words and the same warning as Moses of course brother Bram had two signs just like Moses had two signs okay so Deuteronomy 4 1-4 now therefore hearken o Israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you you shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall you diminish from it that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God see so Moses was saying you got to keep the Commandments of the Lord that he gave to them uh which I command you verse three your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of B peor for all the men that fou Bor the Lord thy God ha destroyed them from among you but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive everyone of you this day we'll go down to verse 25 when thou sht beget children and children's children and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a grave in image or the likeness of anything and shall do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God to provoke him to anger I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land where Uno you go over Jordan to possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but you shall utterly be destroyed so brother Ram uses this to warn uh this generation ation now we're three generations since brother brandham you you had brother bram's children their children and now their grandchildren so for example brother Ram's son Joseph has grandchildren so we're three generations and so brother Ram using this uh this scripture where they utterly perish it's either a spiritual application uh which is spiritual death through the Antichrist the pale horse rider or or to application of uh death writing the payor writer writing during the Great Tribulation period or could be both could be a mixture of both but again brother R uses the same warning and remember it's the word which the Lord thy God commanded okay so and understood correctly this so say I in the name of Jesus Christ quote means we do all the bible-based commands brother brandom gave us that originated from the Bible and we don't add to the Bible's commands uh this statement cannot mean Christians should only say the exact words recorded on the audio tapes of brother brother brandham brother Bram was trying to say what Moses said in charging the people to obey God's word Moses did not mean for Israel to only say his every single word uttered from his mouth he only meant for Israel to keep all the commands of God okay so hope that was a blessing and then you know I I just made a list the other day I reminded myself a list of all the proofs brother Brandon was a prophet um there's six verses that uh prophesied of his ministry to restore all things that were lost during the church ages second he revealed the 12 New Testament Mysteries with six thus say the Lord's statements third uh eight doctrines he gave us with thus sayith the Lord uh fourth he gave us six fulfilled thus sayith the Lord prophecies that can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt some healings some prophetic Visions uh they were all prophesied foretold beforehand on tape and then proven to be true afterwards I have a video on that uh fifth there's 14 Pauline doctrines that brother brandham restored that most churches reject today proving those who receive those 14 Pauline doctrines and keep all the other ones are the true bride of Christ which by God's grace We Believe were a part of that brother M's accusers like believe the sign John Collins um all these other ones they deny these Pauline doctrines most of them uh six and finally of course there's other reasons too but brother had many Supernatural healings and Supernatural discernments verified we're reading the book Generations and there's 38 people testify of repeated Visions brother Ram had that were thus say the Lord foretold um these people knew brother R was a prophet his his visions and prophecies never failed in their lives and that's what we believe too his prophecies and Visions never failed of course we don't understand all of them uh but we know they did not fail okay so again there certainly so much proof out there I've dedicated my life to it proving brother Ram was a genuine prophet of God and of course we see the main thing Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever all right now getting back to acts 86 in my Bible here verse six says and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did so what I want to bring out in this place is that notice we have the same phrase hearing and seeing which is the same phrase in Acts 233 see and hear the Holy Ghost fell in Acts chapter 2 and you could see and hear it this is why brother Ram said wherever the Jesus is there's a lot of noise right wherever the Holy Ghost is there's a lot of noise now of course there's a balance you know be still and know that I'm God in the Psalms David said that um the still small voice but remember as brother Jim showed us you know when God showed up God caused the earthquake Wind and Fire but God's voice was in the Stillness and the quietness of speaking into Elijah's heart or maybe his Spirit we'd say but again they they took Heed These these Samaritans could not deny what they were seeing and hearing and those of us who are believers can all testify to that when we've seen God move when we've heard God move that that that moves us to pay attention to the message to pay attention to the Bible revelations God gave to brother brandham right and the ministry in akan and the ministry in Napoleon and the ministry in um field and albian and Iowa uh the the real saints of God we've seen and heard God move uh God moves unmistakably he gives us many testimonies uh proving that he's alive and well so we see that in the scripture God gives us Miracles and testimonies that people can see and hear like brother Ram said uh nobody can tell me I wasn't born again because I was there when it happened praise God each one of us uh saw it and heard it uh we've seen and heard the change that each one of us have gone through as we've grown in Christ and we had as we've had experiences in the Holy Ghost something you see in here like AAA said she wanted a Pentecostal experience well we got it Hallelujah she got it we saw it and heard it by God's grace along with many of the little ones as well by God's grace or younger ones I guess I shouldn't say little ones anymore now verse seven for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed so here uh the Samaritans saw these demon-possessed people screaming uh de when demons came out and then they were healed praise God beautiful testimony I've seen that as I said in Guyana Trinidad once in Pennsylvania uh I've seen that I think I saw in Iowa last time when I was out there the brother was screaming and crying and uh claimed to be free by the grace of God now PA is an interesting word I looked it up there in the Greek you know just to let you know it's someone who's weakened a relaxing of the nerves weak of the limb so when a a limb is weak a arm or leg or is weak it's a tottering it's feeble knees so um Phillip healed those that were having nerve problems limb problems feeble problems feeble knees feeble legs feeble arms Hallelujah and we've seen that on two occasions where women that are prayed for two women that couldn't move their arms and then one was I'm sorry one was instantly healed while I was preaching up there in Pennsylvania the other one um the sister went home and she was healed the healing struck her later that night by God's grace now notice many were healed not all so that's one thing to keep in mind you know the Bible said in Nazareth Jesus could not do many mighty works because their unbelief um so we see in this samarit uh Samaritan group there was it was a mixed crowd not everybody was healed but many were healed now remember Saints in some cases there was Believers and everybody was healed in the whole entire uh we'd say campaign right or the whole entire uh Revival meeting that's in and we already preached on this in Acts 5 15 and 16 um they brought the sick into the streets they laid beds on the couches this is right after the Holy Ghost fell some of them laid in the shadow of Peter uh and multitude came out unto Jerusalem they brought six F sick folks people vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone so God sometimes will pour out such a powerful move of the Holy Ghost that anyone that comes gets healed and this was so different remember even from the days of Jesus uh remember that man uh uh I can't think of the water now the pool salom right uh the man and he Jesus said do you have anybody there that can take you down to the pool and he said no I don't have anybody to take me down there everybody passes Me by when the angel stirs the waters right so in that that case only one was healed right but God ordained that an angel Would S the water one person was healed but in this case it's such a powerful outpouring everyone was healed so may God grant that everyone in our church be healed soon for the glory of God we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Let each person be healed for the glory of God uh now verse eight and there was great joy in that city um and brother Ram told us the gifts of the Holy Ghost bring joy brother Ram said in Queen of Sheba 1960 he was talking about U the Queen of Sheba seeing Solomon's gift of discernment and wisdom and knowledge operate he said there's nobody can ever see God's gifts operate but what it Thrills them if they've got anything about God at all in them Hallelujah so that's the truth when Supernatural gifts are moving uh it it Thrills the believer whether you know we could start at the beginning with wisdom uh with knowledge uh with uh uh Faith Miracles uh tongues interpretation discernment uh prophecy that's eight of them I always forget one of them uh but anytime those operate we are thrilled right uh and the Bible calls it great joy so brother R could use the word Joy whenever we see God's gifts operate it brings Joy great joy and so remember the Jo joy of the Lord is our strength so that's why we should always pray for the minors God give us the major of Salvation the baptism GH but give us minors as well because these minors also bring joy and the freedom in the Holy Ghost brings Joy the gifts bring joy I want to bring a a a thought here about we must keep this Joy right um we need to we need to make sure the joy lasts and then if we lose the joy the Bible said restore the joy of thy salvation in Psalm 51 so we must make sure if we lose this joy we got to get this Joy back through repentance by the grace of God because we're going to have to endure seasons of Joy but also seasons of loss remember Ecclesiastes 3 uh 1-8 has 14 different times and Seasons uh time to be born die plant pluck up kill heal so healing so healing there's Supernatural healing but the opposite of that is something that kills right something that torments we have to endure both seasons uh there's time to uh break down a time to build up so your health gets broken down but God will bring you Joy back and build you back up there's a time to weep time to laugh time to mourn time to dance Hallelujah time to Cast Away Stones a time to gather the stones a time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing a time to get time to lose a time to keep a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace um so this thought just came to my heart you know um these Miracles brought Joy but no doubt uh Samaria was going to have to go through Seasons again uh Seasons where there wasn't Joy or Joy wasn't easy to come by and notice even Jesus tells us uh the trials will come to test your joy Jesus gives us joy but then he gives us uh he allows us to go through tests and trials to prove us and make our faith stronger right uh that's in Luke 88:13 let me see if I got that scripture handy Luke 88:13 I thought I put it on here okay I don't see it so I will go turn to it so this is the rocky heart remember there's four grounds in the parable of the swer it's in Matthew 13 but also Luke chapter 8 so I'll read Luke 8:13 remember the rocky ground was the second kind the first kind was the unbeliever uh this is the make believer this is the Judas es scariot who no doubt he had Joy at some time but eventually he sold out Christ let's read uh Luke 8:13 they on the Rock are they which when they hear the word receive the word with joy and these have no root for which for a while believe in a time of Temptation Fall Away now this is going to be very similar to what we're getting to uh I'm just realizing it now wow Simon the Sorcerer is like Judas of scarit as at least uh what we see in the scripture we don't know if he ended up repenting and being saved we don't know um but in other words he's like a person where the word of God fell on his soul he was H joyful for a while but then it got uh it's a time of testing came and of course Peter says he's in the gall of bitterness so we'll get to that here shortly but um Jesus says when the word comes it's receive with joy but then a Temptation comes okay and in the Greek a temptation is an experiment right we got to go through the experiment right like job God let job go through the experiment of trying his faith uh it's a trial it's a Proving Grounds temptation is a trial the trial of man's Integrity virtue constancy see Satan wants a test and see uh how virtuous are we how constant are we uh he wants to enti I us to sin or a Temptation whether we will rise whether we will obey the desires uh sinful desires it's an internal temptation to sin um it's sent it's allowed by God to serve to test or prove one's character Faith or Holiness so that's that's how every believer must must go through that experience if you receive the word of God if you ever receive God's word you'll be joyful but then the Temptation comes the test comes and we'll see that here uh with Simon the Sorcerer okay now verse 9 but there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery and beitch the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one interesting look at verse n here um notice this witch now he's a male witch sorcerer but he's calling it he's calling himself the great one and Friends remember you know uh those witches from that Florida message church I was telling you about that were taped only people uh they were witches um they were making uh brother Ram's youngest son the great one they were making brother brandham the great one like every word of his tapes was thus sayith the Lord right which is idolatry right so we see this idea um that demons exalt someone as the great one other than than Christ right they they they want the worship off of Christ onto something else so Simon the Sorcerer had called himself the great one and now we see that same Spirit working today uh calling people the great one that are in our ranks or around our message we'd say the revelation of the Bible for this day calling someone other than Jesus the great one but there's only one great one that's the Lord Jesus Christ okay so we see these people that call themselves The Great one or uh call others the great one uh they're just lying right they're they're deceivers and friends you know I also thought of this um you know brother man was being humble a couple times and he said if I'm not the one to come to bring this Revelation uh for the end times there'll be a great one come after me of course but we know he was talking about himself right I made a video about this uh last year um and some some great ones that call themselves the great one to come after brother brandom um blasted me um they called themselves they actually said they're the great one to Rise um after brother brandham and what they did Saints they they created themselves they called themselves they're the great one they're the judge over the entire message and I've there's a man in Ohio who actually does that of course it's a lie and he says I'm the one to judge the entire fful Ministry and some of these great ones they call themselves great ones they don't even go to church they don't even have a pastor uh one of them is divorced they speak in tongues during their preaching and they never have any interpretation uh they don't follow Matthew 18:15 when someone sins against them or they feel like they're offended they don't go to that person individually they just blast them over the pulpit they just blast them over the uh the Youtube or rumble or whichever when they're on Instagram or Facebook so they don't follow the word of God in many other s Sins Of course that they uh they do um but remember Jesus said his true disciples would not make themselves Lords over God's Heritage but they would be examples under the people remember again a disciple is a learner so the preacher should be the the ones learning uh learning really humbly uh they should be leading and learning learning more about the word more about the message of the hour the preaching of brother more about his sermons they should be the ones leading in that by the grace of God and then remember they're also called ministers they should be the ones serving the most right not just with preaching but in other areas as well so we want to Humble ourselves as ministers we never want to Lord over people we want to Serve the People by God's grace okay now down to verse uh 10 but there was a certain okay okay verse 10 to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God so Simon the Sorcerer he deceived the people and notice they actually thought this was the power of God but it was actually Satan right in Simon the sorcerer's life and I thought this tied in well with what brother random said you know brother randam said some people believe Satan could heal but nine times brother Ram said Satan cannot heal right so Simon the Sorcerer was calling him said he was had that he had the power of God but it wasn't the power of God it was the power of Satan and of course no one was being healed uh that's what the scripture plainly says he Bewitched them which means let me look up the word bewitch which just astonish them okay I want to bring this out again you know brother R talked about how uh some people said uh you know sat or which doctors could heal remember there's three reasons uh why brother R may have said this remember we didn't get all the details from Brother braham's story some people thought um you know certain people got healed by going to wit doctor well there's three things I want to say remember uh Witch Doctors might have given out herbs that bring Divine Healing to people where they're healed over time of course that would uh the credit of healing would go to God right not to the witch doctor but the witch doctor just might have been an herbalist and known about herbs and been able to give them out a second thing is that the Devils uh might have made the people act like they were being healed when in reality they weren't and I've seen this in Guyana and Pennsylvania where the Devils made people made women pass out and made it look like they were anointed by the Holy Ghost but when I lean down to pray for them they kicked and fought and uh were very violent towards me and I learned to keep praying and lay hands on them to cast the demons out a third reason uh these people might have thought uh people got healed by going to Witch Doctors maybe the the witch doctor might have been like balum and had a genuine healing in Jesus name so maybe that witch doctor for a while stopped doing necromancy or um you know any other uh enchantments like balum did he he sought enchantments sometimes but then he sought the Living God sometimes well maybe the Witch Doctor that brother Brown was talking about that certain people saw maybe he or she stopped doing um you know uh demonic worship and maybe they humble themselves and approached God the right way and maybe God heard their prayers maybe the witch doctor prayed in the name of Jesus because he had a gift of Divine Healing like bam had a gift to prophesy we don't know but I just thought I'd bring that in there for verse 10 uh that you can see that that Simon the Sorcerer said his power was from God he didn't say it was from Satan he said it was from God um verse 11 and to him they had regard because that of a long time he had be bewitch them with sorceries so he bewitch them or astonish them so he could do de demonic Powers astonish people right I was just talking to brother uh was it brother Brooks or another brother that they'd seen demons rais people off beds I know brother uh Maxwell Le from Guyana has seen that and he rebuked the spirit in the name of Jesus and then the the body came back down to the ground and it was some other brother I was talking to this week as well had seen that but demons can do astonishing things but remember they only have as much power as God gives them and they all have to under the authority of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have to remember to breathe that holy name in prayer like when my wife just breathed Jesus Jesus when I couldn't breathe the other night Hallelujah and the name of Jesus Set Me Free Hallelujah brought back my breathing and notice it was a long season of demonic activity or oppression so they've been under this astonishment this torment for a long time so no wonder there was great joy when these demons were being cast out no wonder they were so joyful um this is likely what brother Brian remember our evangelist friend brother Brian this is exactly what he felt when he gave his testimony when he overcame the IGI board and Witchcraft books that he was dealing with remember he was uh he had great joy and that's exactly what they experienced here in Samaria they were had the Great Joy being we're free from uh guilt we're free from demonic uh possession and oppression we're free from all these things Hallelujah the Great Joy verse 12 but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women so here's another example of baptism both men and women were baptized and notice they were about the kingdom of God kingdom means ruler or Dominion the rulership of God and the name of Jesus Christ of course the kingdom of God is within you it comes in the name of Jesus Christ um they were baptized in verse 13 uh then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philli and wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done so notice real Holy Ghost Miracles will make witches Wonder they'll be they'll be astonished so the witches were astonishing the the tormented but then when the real Holy Ghost comes the real Holy Ghost makes the witches astonished wow God can set God can heal the py God can heal the lame God can heal the blind all these Mighty Miracles that the Lord Jesus Christ does remember Satan is not a Creator that's why these witches are astonished at the real power of God remember Satan's a Tormentor he brings fear not Faith Satan doesn't bring Faith he doesn't bring freedom he doesn't bring real Joy he doesn't bring real Victory and we can sense it right we have the we have the discernment of the Holy Ghost people can sense when there's real uh real Victory like I was talking to brother Irvin and he's been amongst other message churches and he said brother Jesse when I go there I don't feel the same thing I felt when I come to your church or when you come to preach I feel uh demonic activity I feel Spirits working and I said you're right brother I said there's very few message people that are actually born again because by their fruits they are known Jesus said so even he's now starting to see that there's torment in some of these message churches because the preachers compromise they're tormented with demons and so when they preach uh this torment comes upon the congregations a little Le leavens the whole lump so God help me God help each one of us to keep the leaven of sin out of our Lives continually confess our sins ask the blood of Jesus to forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness for the glory of God and friends as we see here this is the power and evangelist remember Philip is an evangelist this is the power this is not a pastor right this is not a an apostle this is not a teacher um this is an evangelist with the power of God this is not a prophet this is just an evangelist with the commission of God to preach the word of God with Supernatural signs and wonders following all right and then verse 14 and I think I remember now too yeah remember in Acts chapter 4 they went and after they got arrested the first time they went and prayed that signs wonders and miracles would be done well here's the answer to their prayer I believe this just one year later you know God is answering prayers let's keep lifting up the prayers May signs wonders uh and mighty Works be done in the name of Jesus Christ in our midst let's keep lifting up the prayers and we'll trust the same God who answered their prayers in the book of Acts to answer our prayers because we're the current book of Acts Church by the grace of God hallelujah now ver 14 um now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John okay so Peter and John come and then verse 15 who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost so here we have a very interesting scripture uh kind of goes with what brother Adam said Peter James and John were Jesus's Inner Circle um but all that means you remember Jesus love them all to the end John Chapter 13 said we preached that a couple years ago when Austin came back and Lena Jesus loved all of them the same but Jesus could use Peter James and John in a certain ministry right because they represented faith hope and charity that was that was their Ministry Peter had all this Faith but he didn't have as much love right especially when it come down to the um when it come down to the Gentiles in Galatians Chapter 2 he didn't have as much love right U but he had a lot of faith and so here's what we see we need people that have gifts of faith and and John was the disciple of love so John had all this love Peter had all this Faith so faith and love were gifts that God could use for people to be born again of the Holy Ghost notice this wasn't pH Philip's Ministry look at this it's really powerful this wasn't Philip's Ministry for them to get the Holy Ghost this was uh John and Peter's Ministry to get the Holy Ghost so Philip's Ministry was to do signs Miracles and wonders cast The Devils out get them saved baptized Sanctified and then it was uh John and Peter's Ministry to pray for them to get the Holy Ghost and even brother brandom said this remember the sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity Albuquerque New Mexico brother random prays and I've gone through this numerous times but I'll probably go over it again for people seeking the Holy Ghost brother uh he kind of guides people to receive the Holy Ghost and he said four people reive the Holy Ghost during that shower he said praise the Lord he said I may not be a good instructor in this my Ministry is praying for the sick where is there a Pentecostal preacher or somebody a Pentecostal preacher raise up your hand what about this fell prayed for the sick went over here come here here's a man he said I was born out of season in the Pentecostal rank so he wasn't born in 1906 you know he wasn't there in 1906 remember the Revival lasted about 7even years um FF Bosworth was there he said uh I was born out of season but here I want this man here to pray for you I'm going to stand by his side God bless you brother okay then brother Brandon backs up this man's prayer he speaks in tongues he said if you let the Holy Ghost come upon you raise your hands then they go to praying brother B says be reverent now he's gone down to lay hands on people just be real reverent don't look around keep looking up looking up we'll keep praying keep praying brother BR said you take my place brother here you can explain it to them you know more about it than I do and look how humble brother Brandon was he said just come give it out they prayed for it and come to the altar now that's right he said now he said sir God bless you now you know how to do this better than me I'm going to stand here and pray you can give them more instructions so he look at this brother R's a prophet of God and it kind of fits this text perfectly but Ram says other people may have this ministry better than me for praying for people to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like Phillip called for Peter and John for people to come down and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost now Church let's apply this to our church right may God help each one of us to find our Ministries wouldn't it be great if we have people that are seeking the baptism of holy ghost at the altar and we can say brother so and so sister so and so come up here pray with this person so they can get the Holy Ghost you know we feel led to pray for the Holy Ghost now we've had that a few times at our church by God's grace remember brother Simon with brother amen and then I was there with brother amen and haua and Lydia um and different other ones you know over there in aoan so we want to get to the spot where we can recognize callings in people's lives um and you kind of see in your own life you know when you're sick or when you're hurting who do you reach out to who do you have confidence confidence in their prayers and so perhaps that's a person that God has used their gift numerous times that God's heard your prayer I know Jose often talks about my prayers and our prayers and um we want to remember that as well by God's grace but um it don't have to come the same person every time uh as we read those testimonies of brother brandom in the generation book each person was just like call Brother brandom come anytime there was a problem call brother brandom and almost it seemed like many of the times God heard brother rand's prayer so brother Ram was that Prophet uh where you could go to him with problems you go to him if you're sick and God healed so many of those people through brother Ram's prayers but brother Ram's gone the but the Holy Ghost is not gone we need the Holy Ghost and this is my prayer too as I said with Joshua you know God Vindicated Joshua in the eyes of the people and that's my prayer for everyone in our church may God vindicate you and your gift so we can have an idea or we can be led by by the Holy Spirit well this brother or this sister can pray for this or minister with that maybe you need a Word of Wisdom a word of knowledge maybe need prayer for Divine Healing or a miracle uh may God use us may we be so surrendered to God like a glove that Jesus's hand can get into where we can be used by God to help other people that are hurting especially during this time when we're sick and afflicted by God's grace all right uh verse 16 for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ This is a powerful verse you have two um two Mysteries revealed here the mystery of the godhead with the water baptism is here because they weren't baptized in the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost they were baptized in the one name of the father Son and Holy Ghost which is the Lord Jesus Christ so we have two Mysteries um that have a great Revelation right here in this verse they weren't baptized in titles it's the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then the second one is the bapt AP ISM of the Holy Ghost and the three works of Grace there actually might be three mysteries in here um so here we see men and women and even a former sorcerer can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ be repentant and saved but not born again the Holy Ghost has not yet fallen on them has not fallen on their soul now let's look at the Greek here with fallen so the Holy Ghost wants to fall upon your soul Hallelujah which means to rush on he wants to rush in your soul Hallelujah he wants to press upon your soul that's what the word means in the Greek he wants to lie upon he wants to come rest there it is he wants to rest the Holy Ghost is rest brother said the whole Christian Life is rest um he wants to uh embrace you fall back upon he wants to seize you he wants to take possession of you that's another definition I love all these definitions um he wants to cast upon you so these are all uh metaphors these are all uh symbolism of what the Holy Ghost wants to do he wants to rush upon your soul isn't that true he just comes upon you quickly praise God just like a rushy Mighty Wind Hallelujah there it is so the Holy Ghost had not rushed upon their souls but the Holy Ghost had convicted them to repent of their uh sorcery and fear of sorcerers and get baptized their sins forgiven heal some of their bodies I'm sorry many the Holy Ghost healed many of their bodies um but had not come upon Souls yet and they knew it he was not in my soul he's not inside of me U so this is an excellent proof again of the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the three works of grace and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul may God take possession of each one of our souls brother Bram said it will be a life if if Christ is in your soul it'll be a life uh that goes back to the word of God it appoints you to the word of God in every situation Hallelujah and I'm getting close here to the end uh let's see maybe 15 more minutes I'm down to about uh 8 minutes left on my hour uh and we should be able to get done here uh in the8 minutes we'll see okay verse 17 I think we're going to pick up at then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost so here we see um now brother brandom calls this the the the Jewish way to receive the Holy Ghost I'm not sure this is an official Doctrine okay because in our ranks brother Aman got the Holy Ghost with a hand laid on him right uh if I'm not I don't know if brother Aman was holding who his hand when she got the holy ghost or not I I don't remember that um but there's other people um the brother in uh the the piano player in Iowa when he got the Holy Ghost and he talks about that whenever I see him I laid my hands on him right but he's not a Jew okay so I don't know necessarily if this is an actual Bible Doctrine um but the point is brother Ram brother Ram makes a point and he says the he says the G Gentile way to receive the Holy Ghost is just to believe the word right but those of us who had hands laid on us we're Gentiles so just it's just an interesting thought brother he's trying to he's trying to find a pattern in the book of Acts right and in the uh also in the gospels as well but Ram said the Gentile way to receive the Holy Ghost is just believe the word but Ram said the Jewish way is to lay hands on someone all right um I know my wife and I when we got the Holy Ghost no one laid hand on us uh by God's grace now brother R gave two examples the Roman Centurion told Jesus just speak the word of God right and my servant will be made well Jesus didn't have to lay hands and he just had faith in the word and then the second example is the house of cornelus while Peter was preaching the Holy Ghost fell there it is seized and possessed on their souls rushed into their souls while the word of God was being preached H Allelujah um so Church the main thing you know let's not let let's not for those that are seeking the holy ghost or wondering whether we got it or not let's not get caught up well someone's got to lay hands or I just got to believe it when the word of God is being preach just press into it praise God just say it's for me just believe just serve God with all your heart soul mind and strength and if it's anything like when I got the Holy Ghost I wasn't expecting it Jesus said when the wind blows no one knows when it's coming right so we just grow in justification sanctification and when the wind blows it'll surely rush into our souls hallelujah amen amen all right uh now verses uh 18 now here's where we get to this character that's a lot like judas's scarit or the second ground the Stony ground but we don't I don't know the end of him I I didn't look in the histories and I know there's nothing else about him in the Bible verse 18 when Simon saw that through the laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money so Simon must have laid his hands on people and imparted uh spells on them or demons and church that's what I believe is happening in bethl and many of these other churches uh this Kundalini evil spirit cu the people are in literal pain uh when they're shaking and they're laying hands on them and of course these people become women preachers they false prophets they lie you every year they they predict things that happen before the year and they're always wrong um so I believe that's an evil spirit amongst churches today now of course we don't fellowship with those churches but just uh just so you know so what what I what I was bringing out about that is that the the these Jezebel churches aren't saying now you got to speak in tongues because anybody can speak in tongues now they want to have like a actual shaking experience or a passing out experience or some type of physical experience other than speaking in tongues and so they're imparting demonic anointings on people through the laying on of hands and how do we know because they deny the word of God they deny the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they deny brother brandham uh on the serpent seed on the godhead all these scriptures all these doctrines that are thus sayith the Lord thus sayi the Bible they deny those so by their fruits they are known of course they believe in the Prosperity Gospel and all kinds of other lies um they have more leaven that that their Doctrine is totally leavened we'd say and it's undeniable they deny so many Pauline doctrines okay where we at here now verse uh yes verse 19 yeah give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands that he may receive the Holy Ghost verse 20 but Peter said to him thy money perish with thee because thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money I thought he was just saved and was baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and now Peter saying you're going to perish so look how fast uh that seed can fall on a heart that's Stony and Satan can come by and uh you know he can tempt that person uh and it won't have any real root in it it won't have a real solid experience it can be joyful at first he was excited to see the Miracles and people really set free remember he looked wow look at these this is more power than I have but then Satan comes around and uh he's got that Stony ground he doesn't have a real solid understanding of the Gospel right and Satan takes that Joy away so he says thy money perish with thee now here I just want to bring this out again this is a excellent example of how someone can be saved and start getting anointed by the Holy Ghost but then lose their anointings on the stature of perfect man remember Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity they can start getting some of these anointings like Faith uh it looks like Simon the Sorcerer didn't even get the virtue he didn't have a a public testimony that he could serve God right because soon soon as he sees the Holy Ghost uh can be given by laying on of hands he offers them money tries to buy a gift of God isn't it interesting that's money's very connected to him just like it was the balum balum money is what took balum to Hell basically uh the wages of unrighteousness second Peter 2 says very very similar very similar interesting here and of course Judas sold out for money my goodness um again to show let's not be greedy for money let's be thankful for what God gives us but let's also be quick Qui to be generous quick to share by the grace of God um a lot of churches say you can't lose salvation you can't lose the anointing of course you can uh Jesus said that of course in Revelation chapter 3 that he'd blot their names off The Book of Life if they didn't overcome the wicked one or the Antichrist Spirit which remember went through uh Deeds of nicadan doctrines of nicadan doctrine of balam and then the Jezebel spirit so this Jezebel spirit had already anointing had already got on to uh Simon the Sorcerer right after he got saved he lost an anointing and the uh the Devil Comes upon him he loses this battle this temptation to want power from God without uh really uh getting Sanctified we'd say remember it's true uh people can lose their salvation in the first two steps of Grace if they forsake Grace the Bible said or they fail the grace of God or they sell out the grace of God or they are Cast Away uh from the grace of God remember I think I preached 13 metaphors of losing Salvation cast away fail Grace all there there's so there's 11 more I can't remember them now um so uh Simon the Sorcerer at least had the anointing of faith on the statute of perfect man which also is called the sprinkling of the Holy Ghost according to 1 Peter 1:2 sprinkl Under The Obedience that represents being joined to the Covenant right but then you can forsake that Covenant just like the parable of so the word of God can be sewn in your heart but then the birds of the air can come by and snatch it out of your heart you can lose that and the Bible said you can believe for a while Jesus said they believe for a while but they didn't continue believing remember Peter said he was filled with bitterness now this bitterness in the Greek can mean a Bitter Root extreme wickedness so he went from extreme joy to extreme wickedness this extreme greed how can I I can pay money now where' you get that money from putting spells on people so that wasn't money that was even earned honestly so he went from extreme joy to extreme wickedness in a short amount of time this also means poison in the Greek or Venom think of a uh poisonous snake uh po venomous spider you know all these all these uh black widows all these things we don't want to come into contact with this is what happened he got he got free but then he uh lost he lost his anointing he he forsook this anointing in order um in order to try to get the power of God through money try to get the kingdom of God through purchasing it uh through an extremely Wicked way he thought he could buy it with money and you cannot buy God's blessing you cannot buy God's gifts with money either which is what they do at Bethal like I think we're were talking about this they have a school of prophets where you can pay money to become a prophet it's a bunch of Lies um you're born a prophet you either born a prophet or not born a prophet of course Mo most of these people aren't born to be prophets but same idea they're paying money just like Simon the Sorcerer they're paying money to try to become a prophet it's a lie from hell okay and then remember brother brandom said this too he said there's so many preachers that that are in the the trash Heap uh along the sides of the ladder of the Statue of perfect man we're on a we're on we're on Jacob's Ladder praise God Jacob's Ladder must be uh must have eight rungs on it right for each one for the stature the ver eight virtues in the stature perfect man brother said there's so many that fall off off they're climbing up the ladder and they fall off um we've seen so many ministers around the message are just Believers of the message fall off on the stature of perfect man like I said if they go into sexual sin that proves they never had Temperance or maybe they sold out their Temperance um if they uh let the women cut their hair that shows they never had the knowledge the understanding to know that this represents headship and this represents the word of God that I'm under God Christ and my husband and I've got to stay in my position I can't I can't exercise authority over my husband um it shows those women never had the knowledge or if they had it uh they rejected it they failed the knowledge of God they despised the word of God and the knowledge of God brother Ram says it in Statue of man he says uh he said but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us now there's the trouble we find those things happening you know it I know it we see these stumbles along the road think of Judah think of Simon the Sorcerer we think of Anan and Safa we find the scrap heap of Ministers of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go at it right okay so they they started climbing up the ladder then they stopped right they they didn't go all the way into Christ and that's how most of these people were that left the message you know all these websites and podcasts these people they never they never really love the Bible I I hear it on their testimonies they never fell in love with the Bible they just fell in love with brother brandham and then when the evil spirit comes around makes them doubt brother brandom they get mad at brother brandham so all the love that they had turns into hatred right just like with uh Tamar and amnon right this lustful spirit all it is is the evil spirit gets on people and they never fall in love with Jesus Christ the word we must love Jesus Christ the word with all of our heart soul mind and strength Hallelujah give everything we have for the Lord Jesus Christ and of course if we do that then we'll love brother Brandon we'll love the people of God we'll love our enemies we'll love the people that left the message message we love them and beg them to come back and come back to the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet brother Brandon and just that's the same thing Paul said right Paul said many antichrists had already come out into the world and this was just maybe 20 or 30 years after Pentecost so that's the same thing we have today many Antichrist still going out uh slandering brother Ram slandering the message making uh uh disingenuous lies and presumptions about brother brandham uh and that the Bible says they're liars and and their Folly will be exposed Hallelujah now that was verse um the bitterness he said you're in the gall of bitterness yeah verse 21 thou has neither part nor lot in this manner for thy heart is not right in the sight of God he said repent therefore sorry I lost my spot here uh yeah they heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee and remember brother Ram said our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words on Earth but of course that's that's when we let our our thoughts come into words right we all have mind battles but we got to keep those mind battles uh we got to cast them out of our minds and not let not let those evil thoughts come out of our of our mouth or four out of our actions right we're all going to be tempted all the birds are going to fly by and try to roost in our mind but we got to we got to break the nest right we got to shoe the nest out and don't let those evil thoughts continue and say forgive me those thoughts Lord and then of course you know then God doesn't see our evil thoughts in heaven right they're forgiven by the blood of Christ and every believer's battled this down Through the Ages it's the greatest battle ever fought Hallelujah we get Victory by the spirit of Christ so Peter charges him to repent of the wickedness verse 23 for for I perceive that thou are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity so he went from being joyful free and joyful to coming back into bondage back into iniquity so he knew this was wrong he knew this was the wrong thing to do iniquity of course is uh lawlessness it's it's thinking well I don't have to obey God's word uh it's doing what you know is wrong you know you shouldn't do it but you do it anyway so he went so fast for being free to being back in bondage and I like what verse 24 says then answered Simon and said pray ye to the Lord for me that none of these things which you have spoken should come upon me isn't this interesting I thought as I was finishing up here Simon the Sorcerer wanted a man of God a prophet Peter to pray for him doesn't this remind you of uh the Philistine King aimc wanted Abraham to pray for him in order for his house to be healed the curse would come off his house and yet that one was Abraham's fault he didn't tell the truth right of course Peter did nothing wrong in this case but again we still see these uh these uh men and women the these uh men and women that are not uh as obedient as the real Servants of God like Peter and Abraham they're not as obedient although they have some level of respect for God but they got to go to the believer I'll say like this the wise virgin or the make believer have to go to the I'm sorry the foolish virgin or the make believer have to go to the wise Virgin uh and ask for prayer because they've got oil they've got a contact with God they've got the Holy Ghost so that's the thought I wanted to bring out here Abraham of course typed the wise virgin lot typed the foolish virgin so here we see uh Sinners and make Believers or foolish virgin they know who's really in contact with God they know who to go to for prayer remember job's three friends miserable comforters had have job pray for him and friends even when David numbered the people the thousand the people died but David did didn't die when David committed adultery and murder David didn't die should have of course he suffered for that but again God is rich in Mercy to the Saints who are really after the heart of God David really most of the time was a man after the heart of God and then he really repented when he did awful sins he really was sorry he really showed his sincerity and that's what we should do as Christians right and of course David was the type of the foolish virgin Saul was the type of the I'm sorry David was the type of the wise virgin sorry I'm just getting some these words mixed up here and Saul was a type of the foolish David was wise virgin type Saul was foolish virgin type and Friends it just boils down to this then God knows who is his God knows who's the wise virgin God knows who's the foolish virgin we're going to get to that of course in Romans 9 uh when when uh Paul takes us through the sovereignty of God God makes a vessel a certain way one vessel but he makes another vessel another way and God forn knows what they're going to choose um remember so these prophets uh in this case uh Peter Abraham job and David these were God's beloved these were his special ones remember in the Beloved in Greek means uh esteemed these are his dear ones these are his favorite these are his worthy of love and so we just again use the Bible words we don't call ourselves the favorites uh but we call ourselves those who have received the High Calling of God every Church knows it some people want the high calling of God they want to believe all the word of God they want to try to obey all the word of God and then there's others that just want to be saved they just want to live a comfortable life and uh they want to keep you know they want they want to keep uh at his comfortable life and not really uh selling out everything and and getting the oil like the wise virgin okay so this is the group that is the Beloved the favorite uh I'll call it like this maybe the best word is elected or chosen these are the chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world verse 25 and they when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord returned to Jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans so I love that um God does a great Revival in Samaria and then he goes to all the other Villages and then the Saints you know Peter and John of course Philip probably go back you know uh but go back to Jerusalem but notice the Revival continues on say that's what I've said there are six kind of revivals right um there's of course personal individual Revival there's National Revival uh there's the church age Revival um and three other oh there's a Brides Revival and two others well we have the leoan church age Revival of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right we have that Revival um by God's grace and it spread it spread from Lima to akan by God's grace and now we've got to keep it alive and look church now it's spreading to Junction City I've just seen it right there Hallelujah the Revival the Revival just spread right uh the brother called me to come down there and preach you know and then uh 17 got baptized you know so the Revival is spreading and we got to watch how the holy spirit's leading and uh follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit to help this revival spread by God's grace so in closing I just want to say this you know I want um we want to learn from Simon the Sorcerer here we want to learn from James and John and Phillip we want to be Believers no matter what Temptations come right cuz we've all had joy and we're all going to be tested and tried to see if we'll keep that Joy uh no we want to be real Believers no matter what Temptations come we want to have good fruit we want to have - tested Faith a memorial of the work of Grace in our hearts and lives I'm sure you want that as well if
