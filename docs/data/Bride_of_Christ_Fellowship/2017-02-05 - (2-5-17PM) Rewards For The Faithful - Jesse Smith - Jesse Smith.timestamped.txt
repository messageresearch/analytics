[9:48] God's grace. I lost my debit card last
[9:51] Sunday. Saturday at a gas station is not
[9:54] the first time I misplaced it. So, all I
[9:56] did was call the bank and froze the
[9:58] card. I turned the house uh and my car
[10:01] upside down, but knowing God would give
[10:03] me back my card, I kept waiting. Friday,
[10:06] I was going to give in but forgot to
[10:07] call the bank for new card. Saturday, I
[10:09] drove past the same gas station to get
[10:11] gas again. Something said go and check.
[10:14] They had my card ready for me. Praise
[10:16] God for restoring it. Amen. Praise God.
[10:20] Oh, there's more. There's more. I'm
[10:22] sorry. I only been to the gas station
[10:24] two, three times per year. So, for me to
[10:26] stop there again was letter of the Lord.
[10:27] Jesus Christ is faithful and mindful,
[10:29] even the little things. Praise the Lord.
[10:31] Let's give the Lord a round of applause.
[10:32] Amen. Beautiful. Beautiful.
[10:35] That uncction of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[10:37] He knows how to guide us and restore all
[10:39] things. Praise God. Wonderful. Does
[10:41] anybody else have a testimony or

[10:44] Brother Kevin, you have testimony. Come
[10:46] up here, bro. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[10:48] [Music]
[10:51] Thank you.
[10:53] [Music]
[10:55] I just want to uh thank Jesse in front
[10:57] of the church for helping me this past
[11:00] week picking up um some scriptures
[11:03] for a funeral
[11:06] and uh it went really well. They were
[11:08] perfect and uh like to give the credit
[11:13] goes to you for picking them out and it
[11:15] helped the family and uh Marie and I
[11:20] went to the funeral twice this week so
[11:22] it's pretty busy week
[11:25] and uh if you'd pray for me there's a uh
[11:30] a priest
[11:32] in our comm this was in West Virginia
[11:34] over home community where I grew up in
[11:38] and uh this is the third or fourth time
[11:42] that
[11:43] I've done something with the priest. I
[11:46] prayed over a wedding, a Catholic
[11:48] wedding that he did and uh
[11:53] two funerals, maybe three.
[11:57] I crossed this brother's path path a few
[12:00] times and I had a dream about him, too.
[12:05] And uh I'm waiting for the door to open
[12:08] to
[12:11] speak to him. And uh
[12:16] the
[12:18] what uh pray for me about is
[12:21] I I'm going to have I avoid I want to
[12:24] owe I owe him an apology
[12:27] because I formally didn't introduce
[12:29] myself to him and because I have a
[12:32] problem with something
[12:35] and I don't know how to I want I want to
[12:37] meet with him and discuss it with him. I
[12:41] have a tr I have a problem calling him
[12:43] father.
[12:46] I'm sorry, but I'm not ready to. Right.
[12:49] Right. Whether it's right or wrong, I
[12:51] don't I just have a problem with that
[12:54] right now. Yes, sir. And the man has a
[12:56] really good spirit. He's from Kenya,
[12:58] Africa, I believe.
[13:01] And uh and and I thought something was
[13:04] going to happen this week because I saw
[13:06] him three days in a row and I thought,
[13:10] man, I I just waited for an opening, but
[13:13] nothing uh he he knows who I am now. And
[13:17] uh
[13:19] so I just pray about that. Maybe he and
[13:22] I could have lunch or I would like to
[13:25] friend the gentleman. He's got a good
[13:27] spirit about him. Marie even noticed it,
[13:29] too. has a really nice spirit, does a
[13:32] really nice job. Uh the people in that
[13:34] community over home, West Virginia, they
[13:36] really like them. The Catholic people
[13:38] do. And uh so just remember that. And
[13:44] oh uh
[13:48] sometime this week, remember us in
[13:50] prayer. We have to visit a family.
[13:53] There's a girl that I grew up with
[13:57] over home. Her son
[14:00] committed suicide a week ago,
[14:03] two weeks ago
[14:05] and uh
[14:07] her husband's not doing very well. There
[14:10] were some issues there. I think maybe
[14:11] the husband what we've gathered the
[14:14] husband maybe blame
[14:18] and uh a mutual friend that I grew up
[14:21] with has contacted us and asked us to
[14:25] meet with them and speak to him.
[14:28] remember this. Uh
[14:32] when our son passed away, we had I
[14:36] didn't want to go anywhere for a while.
[14:38] I didn't like being in public for a
[14:40] while and people started to worry about
[14:43] us and I noticed a lot of people came to
[14:46] us wanted us to get out and do things.
[14:50] I was fine. I was I just didn't
[14:53] remember this. I wasn't ready to go out.
[14:55] A lot of people, a lot of family members
[14:57] want to get that person out and try to
[15:00] help, but there's a this I know what's
[15:05] going on. This other mutual friend wants
[15:07] us to get down there and I'm going to go
[15:10] see him, but I'm not going to I'm just
[15:12] going to visit. I don't want to discuss
[15:13] any I
[15:16] uh I'm just going to visit and discuss
[15:18] or not discuss anything. Just be there
[15:20] as a friend. Uh because I can remember
[15:23] back when our son passed away, I had a
[15:27] friend come by and he he didn't say
[15:29] anything and that was the best
[15:33] that was the best thing for me
[15:37] and uh
[15:41] I hope everybody could understand what
[15:42] I'm trying to if so if you ever come
[15:45] across that something I don't wish that
[15:48] on anybody if you ever come across that
[15:52] uh another friend of mine's son passed
[15:54] away and I can remember him telling me
[15:58] took him about he said it's going to
[16:00] take you two years.
[16:03] I'm like wow and it was that was true
[16:07] for me. It was about two years
[16:11] for me. Everybody's different but Yes,
[16:13] sir. Uh
[16:16] I think that's all I can't remember now.
[16:18] I didn't mean to talk that much. I'm
[16:19] sorry, but uh I thought I could help
[16:23] with that. That's all right. Thank you.
[16:26] Appreciate that. We'll lift those up in
[16:28] prayer. Thank you, sir. Thank you for
[16:30] sharing that, brother. We appreciate

[16:57] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[16:59] Hallelujah. Thank God for God's love and
[17:03] mercy. You know, that's kind of what
[17:05] scripture we'll look at today is that
[17:06] we're supposed to u go boldly before the
[17:09] throne of grace to find uh grace to help
[17:12] in the time of need. pure religion and
[17:14] undefiled religion before God is to
[17:16] visit the fatherless and the widows and
[17:18] anyone that's hurting. You know, that's
[17:19] that's real Christianity when you can
[17:21] visit people right when they're going
[17:23] through it, brother. So, we appreciate
[17:25] you sharing that. Uh may God guide you
[17:28] there. Any other requests on the hearts
[17:30] of the people? Any other testimonies or
[17:31] anything, sister Marie?

[17:54] of those as well.
[17:56] Dad, Sunny's mom.
[18:00] Yeah. I haven't heard anything as well
[18:01] by God's grace. I'll make sure I text
[18:03] him afterwards.
[18:07] And I also pray for Lisa again. niece is
[18:09] having the surgery Thursday morning at
[18:10] 9:00 a.m. So, I put that on my prayer
[18:12] list for Thursday morning to take her
[18:14] before the Lord and ask God to give her
[18:17] a good surgery and we'll meet the new
[18:19] grandbaby sometime soon. Praise God. If
[18:22] we can, let's just bow our heads in word
[18:23] of prayer. Ask God to minister to these
[18:25] needs.
[18:26] He ever liveth to minister to these
[18:28] needs here. Heavenly Father, we bow our
[18:31] heads, Lord, in a reverence to you, Lord
[18:34] God. Godliness is what we have, Lord
[18:37] God, because of your grace. Reverence
[18:39] for you, Lord. And Father, we come
[18:42] confessing our sins. Forgive me. Forgive
[18:44] us of our sins and transgressions, any
[18:46] evil thoughts, evil words, evil actions.
[18:49] God, please cleanse us, Lord, from all
[18:52] unrighteousness.
[18:54] May these prayers, Lord, be received in
[18:56] heaven. Dear God, we come boldly to find
[18:58] help for each one of these needs. We
[19:00] first thank you, though, for the
[19:01] testimonies of Sister Wendy and Brother
[19:03] Kevin. Thank you for providing both
[19:06] needs, Lord God. You are so mindful.
[19:08] Thank you for the uncction of the Holy
[19:10] Spirit, Lord God, and uh just knowing
[19:13] that you're with us, Lord. What a
[19:15] blessing. What a what a wonderful
[19:17] encouragement, Lord. It's great to see
[19:19] your presence, Father. We pray for these
[19:21] needs, Lord. God, uh we pray for Megan's
[19:24] dad and Sunny's mom as they recover,
[19:26] Lord. Or perhaps they're still battling.
[19:28] I know Megan's dad's recovering. Father,
[19:31] we just pray, God, you be merciful. will
[19:33] be near to them. Give the family such a
[19:35] spirit of love to support them and pray
[19:37] for them. And we pray, Lord, also for
[19:39] her. May these requests go up before you
[19:41] as incense, Lord God, and see the
[19:43] burning desire in our hearts to see our
[19:45] sister Kathy come back again to visit
[19:47] us, Lord. How we'd love to see that,
[19:49] dear God. I pray you'd raise her up,
[19:52] Jesus. We pray. Father, be with this
[19:56] this week, Lord, with Sister Lisa's
[19:57] surgery. Father, may the baby uh be
[20:01] delivered in a healthy manner and
[20:03] protect Sister Lisa, Lord, as she goes
[20:05] through another surgery, another
[20:06] C-section. Strengthen her, Lord God, by
[20:08] the power of the Holy Spirit. Give her
[20:10] swift healing, dear God. And pray the
[20:12] baby, Lord, wouldn't have any blood
[20:14] problems, dear God. Uh we just pray,
[20:17] Lord, that you'd make a way, Lord, that
[20:18] this little child could uh could be
[20:21] healthy, Lord, and and uh and have no
[20:24] troubles, dear Lord Jesus. And father,
[20:27] we also pray this week for brother
[20:28] Kevin. Lord, you give him a chance,
[20:29] Lord, to minister this Catholic priest,
[20:32] Lord, probably ignorant of the things
[20:34] they're doing, Lord. Perhaps may you
[20:37] give Brother Kevin such a a spirit of
[20:39] wisdom and discernment, Lord, to speak
[20:41] things he'd be so salty, Lord, he could
[20:43] have a lunch with them or some type of
[20:45] meeting, Lord God.
[20:48] You see, desire of his heart, Lord God.
[20:49] I pray you minister that need. Be with
[20:51] the Galdo family, Lord. can't imagine
[20:54] the pain, Lord. But, Father, may somehow
[20:57] you comfort them, Lord, in the midst of
[20:59] their pain. You said you'd send the
[21:00] comforter to comfort, dear God. I pray
[21:03] you minister to them, dear Jesus.
[21:05] Father, be with that the father as well
[21:07] that he'd not blame himself, Lord. If
[21:09] he's if he's got something he's he's
[21:12] burdened, may he repent, Lord, if he's
[21:13] got a burden or if he's done wrong. But
[21:16] Father, I just pray God you'd uh give
[21:19] him peace, Lord, and able to walk on,
[21:21] Lord, in time.
[21:25] Father, bless any tithes and offerings
[21:26] we're about to receive, anything at all.
[21:28] And Father, I pray you be with us
[21:29] tonight. Prepare our hearts for this
[21:30] communion, dear God. We're so grateful
[21:32] to be here, Lord God. So glad to renew

[23:45] Lord's side. I stomp by stomp by stomp
[23:48] by stomp. I'm stomping on the Lord.
[23:52] Jumping on. Whose side are you jumping
[23:55] on? I'm jumping on the Lord side. Who
[24:00] side are you jumping on? I'm jumping on
[24:04] the Lord's side. I jump, I jump, I jump,
[24:08] I jump. I'm jumping on the Lord's side.
[24:12] I jump, I jump, I jump, I jump, I'm
[24:16] jumping on. Let's do a wave. And whose
[24:20] side are you waving on? I'm waving on
[24:24] the Lord's side. And who side are you
[24:28] waving on? I'm waving on the Lord's
[24:32] side. I wave, I wave, I wave, I wave.
[24:36] I'm waving on the Lord side. I wave, I
[24:40] wave, I wave, I wave, I'm waving on the
[24:44] Lord's side. Amen. Praise God.
[24:48] Just got to get that starchiness out of
[24:50] me. Praise the Lord.
[24:52] Amen. Thank God for that. Hallelujah.
[24:55] Let's sing one more song. Uh,
[24:58] let's sing uh I know it was the blood.
[25:00] Let's sing that before we get into the
[25:01] word of God. Let's like these pick it up
[25:04] tonight by God's grace. Amen. I know it
[25:07] was the blood. I know it was the blood.
[25:12] I know it was the blood for me.
[25:18] One day when I was lost, Jesus died upon
[25:22] that cross. I know it was the blood for
[25:27] me. I know he's coming back. Well, I
[25:30] know he's coming back. I know he's
[25:34] coming back. I know he's coming back for
[25:39] me.
[25:41] One day when I was lost, Jesus died upon
[25:46] that cross. I know it coming back for
[25:50] me. Thank God for the blood. Well, I
[25:53] thank God for the blood. I thank God for
[25:57] the blood. I thank God for the blood for
[26:02] me.
[26:04] [Music]
[26:05] One day when I was lost, Jesus died upon
[26:09] that cross. I thank God for the blood
[26:13] for me.
[26:16] Oh the blood and oh the blood of Jesus.
[26:23] Oh preious blood of Jesus.
[26:29] And all the blood of Jesus.
[26:34] It washes white as snow. I'm so glad.
[26:41] And I'm so glad that he found me. Yes,
[26:47] I'm so glad that he found me. Yes, I
[26:54] glory that he found me and wash me white
[27:01] as snow.
[27:04] And all the blood of Jesus.
[27:11] Precious blood of Jesus.
[27:16] And know the blood of Jesus.
[27:22] It wash me white as snow. Hallelujah.
[27:28] Praise God. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[27:31] Glory. Let's stand to our feet. Let's
[27:33] take our Bibles here. I got a testimony
[27:36] as you're turning here. I just got a
[27:38] text from Brother Austin.
[27:40] He said, "Brother Jesse, you'll never
[27:42] believe it." This just came in about 5
[27:43] minutes ago.
[27:45] After I sent a text at 9:14 a.m., I
[27:48] tossed and turned for a little bit,
[27:49] struggled to fall asleep because I was
[27:50] very nauseous. My head was pounding, but
[27:52] eventually I fell asleep and I just woke
[27:54] up and I feel fine now. That almost
[27:56] never happens to me. That's
[27:59] supernatural. I thank you so much for
[28:00] praying for me, brothers and sisters at
[28:02] church.
[28:03] God and you guys are great. I'm so happy
[28:05] for that. So, let's give the Lord a
[28:06] round. We know what he means. Only God's
[28:09] great. Bless his heart. I hope he's live
[28:11] streaming by God's grace. Yeah, he gets
[28:13] really bad headaches. Um uh every now
[28:16] and then. So, thank God for his mercy
[28:17] and his love. He believes it's
[28:19] supernatural. I believe that, too. If
[28:20] that's his confession, I believe that.
[28:23] Praise God. Let's open up to Romans 14.
[28:25] I want to, like I said, I want to look
[28:26] at this thought here tonight on rewards
[28:28] for the faithful. That's gonna be my
[28:29] title. Rewards for the faithful.
[28:33] And uh I kind of want to review a little
[28:34] bit. I'm kind of going to put a couple
[28:36] sermons together here, Lord willing, and
[28:38] hopefully keep it about an hour by God's
[28:40] grace. Some things I preached in the
[28:42] past, but uh I think it'll be a blessing
[28:44] to you. Romans 14:7. Romans 14:7.
[28:50] How many love the Lord today? So
[28:52] thankful for God's mercy. You know, and
[28:54] I got kind of inspired on this thought.
[28:55] I was um last night I was texting that
[28:58] the guy who visited I prayed for Jacob.
[29:01] He's like, he sent me some texts. I
[29:02] started sending him text. He's like,
[29:03] brother, that's led of the Holy Spirit.
[29:05] He said, ' That's so deep. And he
[29:06] started, he kept sending me some other
[29:08] things. I kept sending him scriptures
[29:09] and he's like, I've been praying about
[29:10] rewards and crowns and all these things.
[29:13] And uh the thing just kept coming. So, I
[29:15] kind of felt led to go back and look at
[29:17] this and I've been looking at different
[29:18] quotes about well done, good and
[29:20] faithful servants. So, I want to preach
[29:21] on some of those tonight. I just want to
[29:23] be a servant for Christ. Amen. How many
[29:25] want that? We just want to examine our
[29:26] lives, you know, again, as we uh uh
[29:28] just, you know, take communion. We want
[29:30] to make sure we're serving the Lord and
[29:32] and doing all we can for God's glory.
[29:35] Romans 14:7-9.
[29:38] [Music]
[29:42] Romans 14:7. If you're there, say,
[29:44] "Amen." Amen. For none of us liveth to
[29:47] himself, and no man dieth to himself.
[29:50] For whether we live, we live unto the
[29:52] Lord. Whether we die, we die unto the
[29:55] Lord. Whether we live, therefore, or
[29:57] die, we are the Lord. Isn't that
[29:59] comforting? Amen. We are the Lords. For
[30:01] to this end, Christ both died and rose
[30:04] and revived that he might be Lord both
[30:07] of the dead and the living. Wow. That's
[30:10] what the power of the cross
[30:11] accomplished, that he would be Lord of
[30:13] living and dead.
[30:15] But why dust thou judge thy brother? Or
[30:17] why dust thou said it not thy brother?
[30:19] For we shall all stand before the
[30:22] judgment seat of Christ.
[30:25] For it is written, as I live, sayeth the
[30:27] Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and
[30:29] every tongue shall confess to God. Now,
[30:31] let's read verse 12 on three. 1 2 3. So
[30:33] then, every one of us shall give an
[30:36] account of himself to God. Let's bow our
[30:38] heads in a word of prayer. Uh rewards
[30:40] for the faithful. Let's just ask God to
[30:43] help us here tonight. Heavenly Father,
[30:45] Lord, we love you. We we've read your
[30:47] word. I just pray God you speak to us
[30:49] now through this thy word Lord and uh
[30:51] encourage us Lord. Strengthen us here.
[30:54] We just want to be fa faithful Lord God.
[30:56] Really we don't care what the reward is
[30:58] as long as it's you and eternal life
[31:00] Lord. We don't really care what our life
[31:02] reward is. We just want to be faithful.
[31:04] We want to be true to you, Lord. And
[31:06] communion time is such a great time,
[31:08] Lord, as we even look this morning at
[31:10] ourselves deeper. It's such a wonderful
[31:12] time to look at these scriptures again
[31:13] and re refresh them to our hearts and
[31:16] minds. Lord, help us to be faithful and
[31:18] Lord, help us to uh fall more in love
[31:20] with you. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[31:22] name. And everybody said, "Amen." God
[31:24] bless you to be seated. Praise God.
[31:27] That was a very nice text from our
[31:28] brother. Praise the Lord. Nice
[31:29] encouragement right before we preach.
[31:33] Haven't heard from brother. Amen. So, I
[31:35] have to pray for him when we get done
[31:36] here. By God's grace.
[31:41] So, I'd like to um look at these uh
[31:44] tonight. Uh, by God's grace, I want to
[31:46] look at rewards for the faithful. I'm
[31:47] going to start with some of the reward
[31:49] scriptures. On Wednesday, I mentioned a
[31:50] few of them. I think I put a few up
[31:51] there on Wednesday, a few slides and,
[31:54] uh, kind of want to go over this again.
[31:55] Uh, by God's grace, and then I want to
[31:58] look at a few more scriptures on the
[31:59] throne in heaven because I never really
[32:02] finished that thought. I preached two
[32:03] sermons on it, but then I preached
[32:05] another one. Wendy was there. I preached
[32:06] that at brother Cam's uh, two weeks ago.
[32:08] Had a really good time in the Lord
[32:10] there, and I kind of preached it there,
[32:12] but I never finished it here. So, I want
[32:13] to lay a few scriptures in and then I
[32:16] want to close with uh the parable of the
[32:17] talents. I want to close with that one.
[32:19] Uh the Lord willing by God's grace. How
[32:22] many want to better understand the word
[32:23] of God? Amen. Amen. Never want to be
[32:25] satisfied. Never want to be uh
[32:27] complacent. Always want to be hungry for
[32:29] more. Amen. Praise God. That that's
[32:31] really our desire, my true desire. And I
[32:33] prayed that sincerely yesterday. I
[32:35] prayed that this morning. And just
[32:37] feeling really good serving the Lord
[32:39] Jesus. Amen. So, let's look at a few
[32:41] scriptures here. Uh Malachi, I guess we
[32:43] can switch over and we'll put up some
[32:44] scriptures here uh to remind us about
[32:47] the rewards and uh hope it' be a
[32:50] blessing to you.
[32:53] Praise God. We start in Romans 7 uh 14
[32:56] rather 7 through the end.
[33:00] These are different, you know, fonts.
[33:02] These are old powerpoints. I kind of
[33:03] pulled I think I preached this in 2008
[33:04] if I'm not mistaken. I want to pull some
[33:07] of these thoughts and look at some of
[33:08] these tonight. Here was our text, you
[33:09] know, where we are the Lord's and
[33:11] everyone gives an account unto Christ uh
[33:14] of himself.
[33:17] And so we want to be faithful obviously
[33:20] and we we're going to have to give an
[33:21] account. We're going have to tell
[33:22] exactly why we did th this why we chose
[33:24] to do that. And don't you want to just
[33:26] stand there and say, "I did it because I
[33:28] felt led to do it by your Holy Spirit. I
[33:31] prayed. I waited. I didn't try to jump
[33:33] or hastily make a decision and I just
[33:35] waited upon your leading, Lord. That's
[33:37] why I did it." And uh that's we want to
[33:39] we want to be able to answer all that uh
[33:41] in that type of manner because we're we
[33:42] are all going to stand before the
[33:43] judgment seat of Christ. Remember in
[33:45] brother Ram's vision in the fifth seal
[33:47] about going beyond the curtain of time.
[33:48] Of course he told it back in 1961. Um
[33:52] but remember he said the the voice said
[33:54] you'll be judged first before you go to
[33:56] your people. Judged. You'll be judged
[33:58] first. Judged. Uh you have to give an
[34:01] account and it'll be judged. And thank
[34:03] God Jesus told us what the words will
[34:05] be. It'll be well done, good and
[34:07] faithful servant. Amen. Those are the
[34:08] words. When he judges and looks at our
[34:10] lives, he'll say, "Well done, good and
[34:12] faithful servant." So, we know uh what
[34:15] the judgment uh entails uh being
[34:17] faithful. And then we're given it's
[34:19] given a a a consolation of it was done
[34:22] well. Hallelujah. So, we want to do
[34:24] that. Now, worthy to escape and stand
[34:27] Jesus tells us this. Now, this scripture
[34:29] is for our day. Brother Ram talked about
[34:31] this scripture. and take heed to
[34:33] themselves, lest at any time your hearts
[34:35] be overcharged with surfeting and
[34:38] drunkenness and cares of this life, so
[34:40] that that day come upon you unawares.
[34:42] That's why we're watching and praying.
[34:43] Amen. Don't let the physical natural
[34:45] things distract you from the day that's
[34:47] coming. For as a snare shall come upon
[34:49] all them that dwell upon the face of the
[34:50] earth. Watch ye therefore and pray
[34:52] always that you may be accounted worthy
[34:55] to escape all these things that shall
[34:57] come to pass and stand before the Son of
[35:00] Man. So, we must be worthy to escape and
[35:03] worthy to stand before him. Now, this is
[35:06] speaking of at the judgment seat of
[35:07] Christ, right? For rewards. And we'll
[35:09] get to that in just a moment. By God's
[35:11] grace.
[35:13] Now, every man shall receive his own
[35:15] reward. The Bible said in 1 Corinthians
[35:17] 3. Now, he that planteth and he that
[35:18] wareth her one. Now, this is actually
[35:19] speaking of preachers in this case, but
[35:21] we know it's every every man, every
[35:24] work, every man has a work, rather,
[35:25] every woman has a work. And every man
[35:27] shall receive his own reward according
[35:29] to his own labor.
[35:31] All right. So we have a work to do. And
[35:33] it must be a labor of what? Love. Not
[35:35] legalism. A labor. Labor of love. We
[35:37] must love to do it. We must get back in
[35:39] our minds. Transform our minds that we
[35:41] love doing our job for the Lord.
[35:43] Whatever job he's called you, whether
[35:44] music or preaching or family life or
[35:46] whatever individual serving others, like
[35:48] we said, it's all service. Whatever,
[35:50] wherever your area of service is. For we
[35:53] are laborers together with God. You are
[35:54] God's husbandry. You are God's building
[35:57] according to the grace of God which is
[35:58] given unto me as a wise master builder.
[36:01] I have laid the foundation. See the
[36:03] first church age. Amen. And another
[36:05] buildth thereon. But let every man take
[36:06] heed how he buildth thereon.
[36:10] For other foundation can no man lay than
[36:12] that which is I'm sorry than that than
[36:14] that is laid which is Jesus Christ. Now
[36:17] if any man build upon foundation gold,
[36:19] silver, precious stones, wood, haste,
[36:21] stubble, every man's work shall be made
[36:23] manifest. for the day shall declare it
[36:25] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[36:29] the fire shall try every man's work of
[36:31] what sort it is. So I was uh I was
[36:35] texting that Jacob guy. I love him. He's
[36:37] just a good he's like brother Kevin said
[36:39] he's just got a good spirit. You know he
[36:40] always backs me up. You know everything
[36:42] I preach at the Bible club and
[36:43] everything everything I preach here he
[36:45] backs it up. But uh as I was texting him
[36:48] the thought came to me of Lot in Sodom.
[36:51] The fire that fell tried his work.
[36:53] Right. It tried him. The fire tried it
[36:57] and it saw how many did people to get
[36:59] saved? He got two saved.
[37:01] His wife wasn't other family members
[37:03] wasn't. He got two saved. That fire
[37:07] tried his work. Does everybody see that?
[37:08] By God's grace, it was revealed by fire.
[37:11] It also revealed Abraham's power of
[37:13] prayer.
[37:14] Glory. Amen. Remember, he prayed for her
[37:16] Lot and the Bible said God remembered
[37:18] Abraham's prayer. So see all the fires,
[37:21] all the judgments, all these trials will
[37:24] reveal what works you did. Got to
[37:27] remember your prayers, church. When the
[37:28] hard times come, got to remember your
[37:30] prayers. Hallelujah. The thing to do is
[37:32] stay in communion. Stay in prayer with
[37:34] the Lord Jesus.
[37:35] Pray for those foolish virgin or pray
[37:37] for the priests or pray pray that they
[37:39] won't be foolish virgin or whatever
[37:41] more. Just pray. Intercede. God
[37:43] remembers our prayers and fire will try
[37:46] every man's work. What sword it is.
[37:49] Hallelujah.
[37:52] Now finishing the verse. If any man's
[37:55] work abide which he hath built
[37:56] thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
[37:59] If any man's work shall be burned, he
[38:02] shall suffer loss. Didn't lot lose his
[38:03] wife lost. But he himself shall be
[38:06] saved. Yet so as by fire.
[38:09] See what I thought my what? That was
[38:11] just felt inspired. That wasn't me. I
[38:13] felt that was the Holy Spirit because he
[38:15] brings everything to your remembrance.
[38:17] So see if if it doesn't uh go through
[38:19] the fire like we sang about he'll take
[38:22] you through the fire again. Uh if it
[38:24] doesn't make it through the fire, it
[38:26] suffers loss. Think about the three
[38:28] Hebrew children. Their own lives were
[38:30] brought through the fire. Amen. They
[38:31] didn't suffer loss. They suffer gain.
[38:33] Amen. Hallelujah. They said even if I
[38:36] don't make it through the fire, we won't
[38:37] serve sinners. Amen. We won't serve the
[38:40] beast 666 like it was 600 by 60 and six
[38:44] all that. We won't serve the mark of the
[38:46] beast. Amen. We won't bow to the pope.
[38:48] Hallelujah. Or the world ecumenical
[38:51] system. Amen. Ain't that beautiful? By
[38:54] God's grace. The fire will prove
[38:55] everything. The the fires of God. Like
[38:58] brother Bam said, the uh the rapture
[38:59] will prove who is the the wise virgin
[39:01] and who is the foolish. The fire of the
[39:04] rapture. Amen.
[39:06] And brother Bam like and remember this
[39:07] this is just a quote and I believe we
[39:09] can find the scripture too. Let's go to
[39:11] Revelation 8. I think that's the
[39:12] scripture. Revelation 8. But the Ram
[39:14] about in the rat. No, I'm not sure. I'm
[39:16] not at this point. I'm not quite sure
[39:18] which sermon it was. Um, he talked about
[39:21] the fire falling. I don't remember which
[39:23] one that was. Uh, I forget where it was,
[39:26] but he talked about the rapture. He
[39:27] likened the rapture unto the fire
[39:30] falling. And he talked about when he and
[39:31] his family went out to see this site and
[39:33] they said, "Get ready. The fire is ready
[39:34] to fall." I don't remember the quote.
[39:36] Brother Jose, do you remember that
[39:37] quote?
[39:41] Park. Yeah. Euseimony Park. Yeah. I
[39:43] don't remember. Brother Lord, do you
[39:44] remember which sermon? Okay, I don't
[39:45] remember. I could look it up, but it
[39:46] would take a little bit. Okay, it might
[39:49] Yeah, it might be in the rapture
[39:50] message. I I thought it was. But he
[39:51] likened the fire falling to the rapture.
[39:54] Now, look at Revelation 8:1. And when
[39:56] he'd opened the seventh seal, there was
[39:57] silence in heaven about the space of
[39:59] half an hour. And I saw the seven angels
[40:02] which stood before God. And to them were
[40:04] given seven trumpets. And another angel
[40:06] came and stood at the altar having a
[40:08] golden sensor. And there was given unto
[40:09] him much incense that he should offer it
[40:11] upon the prayers of all the saints upon
[40:13] the golden altar which was before the
[40:15] throne. And the smoke of the incense
[40:17] which come came with the prayers of the
[40:20] saints ascended up before God out of the
[40:23] angel's hand. The angel took the sensor
[40:25] and filled it with fire off the altar
[40:27] and cast into the earth and there were
[40:28] lightnings or thunderings and lightnings
[40:30] and earthquakes. So I just thought this
[40:32] was interesting. Brother man talked
[40:33] about the rapture talked about fire
[40:34] falling. Here we have fire falling right
[40:37] after the opening of the seventh seal.
[40:38] We know the seventh seal was the day or
[40:40] hour. Brother Bam tells us that. So I
[40:41] just thought I'd lay that in there.
[40:42] That's a little interesting. All right.
[40:44] But both are connected with the falling
[40:46] of fire. Remember God always vindicated
[40:48] his sacrifice by sending fire. Amen.
[40:51] With Elijah, with Solomon, with Moses.
[40:53] Hallelujah. Always fire falling. With of
[40:55] courseh Abel as well. Now here's some
[40:59] more scriptures on rewards.
[41:01] Now, I think I think what I'll do if I
[41:03] remember right, I think I'll just skip
[41:04] past and hit the highlights because uh I
[41:06] think I sum these up uh on a few slides
[41:09] here. Yeah. Here's the and I showed
[41:11] these on Wednesday, too. You and I when
[41:14] we labor, here's what we get rewards
[41:16] for. How many How many like this? By
[41:17] God's grace, you get reward for
[41:20] withstanding persecution, just standing
[41:21] any trial, standing any making fun, and
[41:24] during temptation, Jesus said you get a
[41:26] reward for that. Giving a cup of water
[41:28] in the name of Jesus or disciple, get a
[41:30] reward for that. Receiving a prophet or
[41:33] righteous man, there's a reward for
[41:34] that. Hallelujah. Praying in secret.
[41:37] Giving alms in secret. Planting and
[41:39] watering the gospel. We just read that.
[41:41] Leaving family members, possessions for
[41:43] the sake of the Lord. There's a reward
[41:44] for that. Fighting a good fight. Keeping
[41:48] the faith. Making a dinner for those who
[41:49] cannot repay you. Pure and undefiled
[41:52] religion. Visiting the fatherless and
[41:53] widows in their affliction. That's pure
[41:55] religion.
[41:56] loving enemies, lending with hope of no
[41:59] repaying,
[42:01] being kind to the unthankful and evil,
[42:04] serving God willingly, hardly service to
[42:07] the Lord in anything, and diligent
[42:09] seeking of God brings you rewards. I I
[42:12] got those because I went through all the
[42:13] New Testament on the word reward. Now,
[42:15] let's look at these quotes. I want to
[42:17] These are the ones I hadn't read to you.
[42:18] I read through the scriptures, but
[42:20] hadn't read these. Okay. Yeah, let's
[42:22] read these two.
[42:25] Right here. Yeah. No, right here.
[42:28] Second John 1 8 and9. This is beautiful.
[42:31] This is what the brother was saying on
[42:32] the text. He's like, "Brother, that's
[42:34] deep." I said, "Well, just the Holy
[42:35] Spirit. Just the word of God. Watch
[42:37] yourselves so that you may not lose what
[42:39] we have worked for, but may win a full
[42:42] reward." What are you working for? To
[42:44] win souls. Hallelujah. Uh to uh keep the
[42:48] kingdom of God going, right? Shining,
[42:51] manifesting Christ. This is what you're
[42:53] working for. I thought that was
[42:55] beautiful. A full reward. Now, think
[42:57] about this. We're going to get to the
[42:58] talents. Remember the full reward. You
[43:01] got a full reward if you were faithful
[43:02] with what God gave you. A full reward
[43:05] was doubling what Christ gave you. All
[43:07] right? So, think about that. A full
[43:09] reward.
[43:11] Whosoever transgressth and abideth not
[43:13] the doctrine of Christ hath not God. He
[43:16] that abideth in the doctrine of Christ,
[43:18] he hath both the father and the son.
[43:19] Now, that reminds me this morning.
[43:20] Remember that scripture about doctrine?
[43:22] You got to stay in the doctrine. And if
[43:24] you do that, full reward. Amen.
[43:26] Hallelujah.
[43:28] Behold, I come quickly. Hold that fast
[43:30] which thou hast that no man take thy
[43:34] crown. This is what came to me when I
[43:36] was texting him. Um when I was texting
[43:39] the brother, Judas was given a ministry,
[43:43] but he forsook the ministry and God
[43:45] raised up Matias. Now, brother Brandham
[43:46] said he never did nothing. Uh, that
[43:48] might be true, but I went and read
[43:50] history and it just said that he did a
[43:51] lot of preaching and winning souls. So,
[43:53] I I don't know. I'm just saying we know
[43:55] ultimately, right, Matias, if he wasn't
[43:57] it, Paul was put in there with the 12,
[43:59] right? Paul was put in there. And look,
[44:02] here's Judas spot. He could have been a
[44:04] he could have been a messenger to the
[44:05] Gentiles, right? Or he could have had
[44:06] some great position. He forsook that.
[44:09] And what did God do? God filled in
[44:10] Matias. And then obviously God filled in
[44:12] St. Paul. Amen.
[44:15] And somebody takes his ministry.
[44:17] somebody takes his position because he
[44:20] forsook his calling in life. I wonder
[44:22] how many when we see preachers walk
[44:23] away. I wonder if they didn't have a
[44:25] real calling of God, but then they they
[44:28] left it for whatever reason. Money,
[44:29] popularity, women, like we said, for
[44:31] whatever reason, they might have a
[44:33] genuine call of God because Judas had a
[44:35] genuine call. Jesus prayed all night
[44:37] before he called Judas. He had a genuine
[44:40] call. He said, "Come follow me. I'll
[44:42] make you fisher of men." He said that to
[44:43] all of them. But he turned it and
[44:45] another man takes his crown. Now think
[44:48] about what's God calling you to do.
[44:50] Let's be faithful to what God called us
[44:51] to do. Now look at this quote. It's
[44:53] beautiful. Father, the hour has come.
[44:55] 1956. The time has come that God will
[44:58] gather his church together through the
[45:00] through under one great big banner of
[45:02] the Lord Jesus Christ and pour out his
[45:04] powers among them and great signs and
[45:06] wonders will take place. The time has
[45:07] come. The time has come for the
[45:09] Pentecostal church to make a stand. The
[45:11] time has come to circumcise the church
[45:13] and call out this foolishness.
[45:16] The time has come to go back to the old
[45:17] landmark. The time has come for the
[45:19] outpouring. The time has come for the
[45:20] gathering of the people. The time has
[45:22] come for Jesus to come. The time will be
[45:26] here soon to give out the rewards. Amen.
[45:30] Brother, be careful that your crown
[45:32] isn't set on someone else's head. The
[45:35] time has come. I never forget when I got
[45:37] an invitation to preach some uh Labor
[45:39] Day meetings and one preacher turned it
[45:42] down and eventually fell the message and
[45:44] I took it and God won some save some
[45:46] souls there that just did a wonderful
[45:47] work. I forget all the testimonies. I
[45:48] don't want to start saying things
[45:49] because I might forget I might mix up
[45:51] sermons. I thought it was so interesting
[45:53] and he gave it up to go watch a football
[45:55] game.
[45:57] Yeah, that's exactly what I talked to
[45:59] him later. He gave up preaching Memorial
[46:01] Day services or Labor Day to watch a
[46:03] football game and uh then fell away the
[46:06] message. And I recently saw I'm friends
[46:08] with him on Facebook. I saw him dancing
[46:10] to Guns and Roses uh drunk at a wedding
[46:13] reception.
[46:14] Be careful. What the Bible say? Be
[46:17] careful of what you've already got. That
[46:19] no man take your crown. I'm not saying I
[46:21] took his crown. I'm just saying that's
[46:22] one example where I can see God had
[46:24] invited God invited him to minister.
[46:27] Right? The pastor's heart was for that
[46:29] brother to come. He turned it down. I
[46:31] stepped in and I don't know just look
[46:32] just look what happens. I'm just saying
[46:34] that's one simple example where I can
[46:36] clearly see
[46:38] where an opportunity was given to
[46:40] someone and they turned it down. God
[46:42] help us never to turn down the call of
[46:43] God. Amen. But see, it had to manifest
[46:46] that way to show what was in the
[46:48] person's heart.
[46:50] The time has come. We're at the end
[46:52] time. If we're ever going to do
[46:53] anything, brethren, we're going to do it
[46:54] now. The time is at hand. The time has
[46:56] come when God's shaking every
[46:58] denomination under the sun. I'm glad he
[46:59] shook my denomination because now I'm
[47:01] out of that denomination. Amen. Glory.
[47:04] See, be careful that your crown isn't
[47:07] set on someone else's. Can you imagine
[47:08] Paul getting the crown and it should
[47:10] have been could have been Judas. Could
[47:12] have been could have been Judas's. That
[47:14] was his apostilhip, the Bible says, but
[47:17] he forsook it. And so God found somebody
[47:20] else to take his place. My now I'm
[47:22] sorry. These are so tiny. God forgive
[47:24] me. I don't mean to hurt your eyes. Just
[47:26] believe that. I tried to raise the font
[47:28] size, too. But this is a PowerPoint
[47:30] file. It wouldn't work because it
[47:32] doesn't mesh well with Keynote. So,
[47:33] forgive me. I'll just read that first
[47:35] paragraph. Now, he can provide himself a
[47:37] church. He don't have to have me. Look
[47:38] at Look how humble the man was. He don't
[47:40] have to use me. See, that's why I said
[47:41] God don't have to use me to be a pastor
[47:43] here. He don't have to have you. You
[47:45] know, he don't He don't have to have He
[47:47] can provide. Somebody else can take your
[47:49] place. Be careful some don't take your
[47:51] crown. He don't have to have us, but we
[47:54] have to have him. Isn't that powerful?
[47:57] You don't I mean that see we love Christ
[47:59] and we know he loves us but we don't
[48:00] want to ever take it for granted because
[48:03] then it might show something's wrong in
[48:04] our heart, right? Like Judas something
[48:06] showed obviously something's wrong
[48:07] there. You forsake your apostilhip, God
[48:09] will raise up somebody else. My
[48:13] and then he said he gives oh it gives a
[48:15] good example of Jesus. He said, "If you
[48:17] ever lived, you've got to have him
[48:19] because he's the only one." As Peter
[48:21] said,
[48:22] "Will you all?" Jesus said to Peter,
[48:24] "Will you all go away?" It's like Jesus
[48:26] saying, "If you want to go." Now, think
[48:28] about that. My I just thought about
[48:29] that. 70 preachers left, but after
[48:31] Pentecost, look at all the thousands
[48:32] that came in. I imagine God raised up
[48:34] hundreds of preachers, thousands of
[48:35] preachers. Those 70 left, fine. If you
[48:37] want to go, I'll raise up somebody that
[48:39] will believe it. Amen. I'll raise up
[48:41] somebody that will rejoice, not over
[48:43] just miracles, but having their names
[48:45] written in heaven. Hallelujah. On the
[48:47] lamb's book of life. Amen.
[48:49] Beautiful.
[48:52] Look at this. Wisdom versus faith. Now,
[48:55] if you have eternal life today, you are
[48:56] in God. By God's being in you, you are
[49:00] God's expressed thought. Woo. Then don't
[49:02] listen to any reasonings lest your crown
[49:04] be taken and give to another.
[49:07] Don't take any reasonings at all. Just
[49:09] believe what God says is truth and stay
[49:11] with it. What' that preacher fall away
[49:12] from? The believe the sign stuff. Oh,
[49:14] there's no cloud. Oh, brother Brandham's
[49:16] not a prophet. All this other stuff. And
[49:19] really, I and I was emailing back and
[49:21] forth with people around that move. I
[49:22] said, "Really? Can you prove the cloud
[49:24] wasn't from God?" And they can't. You're
[49:26] taking both of us are taking somebody's
[49:28] word. They're either taking the NASA's
[49:31] word or whoever it is out there in
[49:32] California, whatever. Or we're taking a
[49:34] vindicated prophet of God's word. Uh, I
[49:38] don't take very long to to decide who
[49:39] I'm going to trust on that one. I'm
[49:41] gonna trust God's prophet who preached
[49:43] salvation through Jesus Christ preached
[49:45] the revealed word of the Bible said thus
[49:47] sayith the Lord 4,000 times. I'm gonna
[49:49] trust that man. Amen. Hallelujah.
[49:51] Because ultimately you're going to trust
[49:53] somebody that NASA wasn't there to see
[49:55] it. Brother Brandon was there to see it.
[49:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Who you going to
[49:59] trust? Uh California government or or a
[50:02] man sent from God? I'm going to trust a
[50:04] man sent from God every time. Amen.
[50:06] Don't take reasonings. See, and the
[50:09] reason he liked that because he didn't
[50:11] like marriage and divorce. And then he
[50:12] wrote we wrote this email back and
[50:13] forth. I tried to persuade him to come
[50:15] back and he didn't like marriage and
[50:16] divorce and didn't like different things
[50:18] brother said about women and all these
[50:20] things and
[50:22] every for every qu question he had, I
[50:24] gave a good Bible answer
[50:26] and didn't like that. Never responded to
[50:28] any of it. But uh I tried by God's
[50:30] grace. Now this is beautiful
[50:34] in the scripture in Revelation 3 in the
[50:36] church age.
[50:41] He tells us to hold fast fast till he
[50:43] comes. Okay. Oh yeah. Here it is. That
[50:45] no this is actually scripture. Behold I
[50:47] come quickly. Hold fast what thou hast.
[50:50] Let no man take thy crown. Look at that.
[50:52] That's actual words of Christ.
[50:55] Brother Kevin, you got a crown there
[50:56] waiting for you. Brother Adam Jose,
[50:58] brother Bang Loris, we have crowns. All
[51:01] the sisters, you got crowns waiting
[51:02] there for. Don't let anybody take your
[51:04] crown. He's got a place for somebody in
[51:06] Akran, Ohio that'll serve him. And he's
[51:09] got a crown waiting for somebody. Now,
[51:10] you decide if you want your crown or you
[51:12] want to give it to somebody else. Is
[51:14] that right? That's exactly right. But
[51:16] Ram said, "It is in the midst of a time
[51:18] of great trouble that Jesus comes. And
[51:20] with his coming, there's a resurrection.
[51:22] Many are going to come forth out of the
[51:23] dust and rise with those who are alive,
[51:25] but waiting for his return. And these
[51:27] will be given crowns." Why? Because they
[51:29] are sons of God. They are kings with
[51:32] him. Oh, glory. They're reigning with
[51:34] him. That is what the crown signifies.
[51:37] Reigning and ruling with the great king
[51:39] himself. Oh my. That is the promise to
[51:42] all those who suffer with him here on
[51:44] earth. All those who endured patiently
[51:46] knowing that God, the just judge would
[51:49] reward them. Amen.
[51:51] They who gave up all for him. Glory. And
[51:54] commit it all to him will sit down in
[51:56] his throne and share in his glorious
[51:58] kingdom. Amen.
[52:00] Hallelujah. Look what he says next. Oh,
[52:03] we have a word for us all at this time.
[52:05] You want to know the word? Just hold
[52:06] fast. Persevere.
[52:09] Hold fast. Keep going. Keep uh
[52:11] persevering. Don't give up. He said put
[52:13] on the whole armor of God, which Abraham
[52:15] said, you have to have the Holy Ghost to
[52:16] have the whole armor of God on. Got to
[52:18] be born again. He said Peter tried to.
[52:20] He couldn't even argue against the maid
[52:22] before the crucifixion. He said because
[52:23] he didn't have the full armor of God. He
[52:25] went to Pentecost, got the full armor of
[52:27] God, and fought so much and fought so
[52:29] hard he was even be privileged to be
[52:31] crucified upside down. Amen.
[52:36] Use every weapon he's given to us. Got a
[52:38] lot of good weapons in here. Praise God.
[52:40] Amen. Use every gift at our disposal and
[52:44] look ahead with joy. Mal, I need to
[52:45] switch this over. Did I forget to switch
[52:47] it over?
[52:48] It's okay. All right. Thank you, sir.
[52:50] Sorry. Use every gift at our disposal
[52:53] and look ahead with joy because we're
[52:55] going to be crowned by him who is King
[52:57] of Kings and Lord of Lords. Isn't that
[53:01] beautiful? You like that? Don't let
[53:03] anybody take your position. Anybody take
[53:05] your crown. Now look, church, you get a
[53:06] crown just for being a faithful church
[53:08] member. Amen. Serving God. You got a
[53:10] position. You got a crown here. You got
[53:12] to fulfill your post of duty. Praise the
[53:14] Lord. Now, now we did the rewards here.
[53:18] Let me scroll down. I had a few things I
[53:20] wanted to share on this.
[53:25] Yeah. Some are given now or some are
[53:26] later. Remember the rewards. Like Jesus
[53:28] said, they asked Jesus, "Oh, we've left
[53:30] all. We followed you."
[53:33] And he said, "Uh, you've left the go
[53:35] everything for gospel sake." In verse
[53:37] 30, but he shall receive a hundfold now
[53:39] in this time
[53:41] houses and brethren and sisters and
[53:43] mothers and children lands with
[53:45] persecutions and the worlds to come
[53:48] eternal life.
[53:50] So all you do for God, there's rewards
[53:52] now and there's rewards later. Praise
[53:54] God. He's not going to let you go
[53:56] through life and not be rewarded. Amen.
[53:58] If you leave everything, he'll give you
[53:59] everything. Amen. Just think about Kevin
[54:01] and Marie. They could drive to Bluffton
[54:04] and every house in the church would be
[54:05] open for them probably, right? Because
[54:07] you've inherited new family members. I
[54:10] could go back home and and if my mom
[54:11] wouldn't let me in, I all those members,
[54:13] all the saints there, if I go to Lima,
[54:15] all those saints would gladly open their
[54:17] home for me. Why? Because we have a new
[54:19] family. Praise the Lord. I was telling
[54:22] brother Austin uh yesterday we were
[54:24] fellowshipping. I said, "Bro," he's
[54:26] like, he's like, "Brother, all the we we
[54:27] were talking about, you know, different
[54:28] things we go through." I was like,
[54:30] "Brother, there are so many believers
[54:32] your age that serve the Lord." He's
[54:34] like, "Really?"
[54:36] I said, 'We need to take you to the
[54:37] winter Youth retreat or we need to take
[54:39] you to some conventions. He's like,
[54:42] "Yeah, I just want to talk to somebody
[54:43] who's my age." 20. He's 20 that uh
[54:47] because everybody here is all married or
[54:48] or you know, or older or something like
[54:50] that or male or female, you know, you
[54:51] can't you can't really fellowship like
[54:53] that, you know. Uh I said, "I'm" and so
[54:56] I contacted Brother Samuel Browning.
[54:57] He's going to let us come to the uh they
[54:59] have little uh youth meetings at his
[55:01] house twice a month. So, he's going to
[55:02] let us come there. I'm going to get them
[55:04] hopefully take brother Austin there if
[55:05] he's not sick or something like that and
[55:07] get some fellowship
[55:09] because he's left on he's got no friends
[55:11] left. I thought that's exactly what God
[55:13] wants him to do. Get away from all his
[55:15] friends who can give him a hundfold now.
[55:18] Amen. They got to be somewhere. Amen.
[55:20] I'm not saying they're all Sheffield.
[55:21] They're all all around. But just got to
[55:23] meet them by God's grace. Amen.
[55:26] Amen. So, see rewards now and rewards to
[55:30] come.
[55:31] Now,
[55:33] let me uh I think that was the main one
[55:34] I want to get out of there cuz I was
[55:35] looking here.
[55:38] All right. Now, I want to reread this
[55:40] here.
[55:42] The dream about the crowns being given
[55:44] out. Yeah, here it is. Brother's dream.
[55:45] I read this, like I said, back in
[55:46] August. It was on a Wednesday night. I
[55:48] don't know. Did anybody remember that?
[55:50] Okay, there's no hands up. Okay, so you
[55:51] don't remember. Okay. So, you need it
[55:53] again because I was encouraged when I
[55:54] read this. I thought, my this is
[55:56] beautiful. Praise the Lord.
[55:59] He said, "Coming down there, that
[56:00] glorious palace yonder, that kingdom of
[56:02] God there, where all the old will be
[56:05] young, where the white robes, he said,
[56:08] are already on them." Amen. Not like the
[56:10] Jews. The Jews don't have the white
[56:12] robes. Remember, under the throne in the
[56:13] martyr's altar, they don't have any
[56:15] robes. But he said the robes are already
[56:16] on them there. Hallelujah. Amen. And the
[56:20] men and women has changed in the beauty,
[56:22] the very art of a handsome man, a lovely
[56:24] woman standing there and all the beauty
[56:26] and statue of a young woman and a young
[56:27] man standing there and can never get
[56:29] old, never can be sinful, never give me
[56:31] any jealousy, hatred, anything.
[56:32] Hallelujah. Amen. I want to be there.
[56:34] Hallelujah.
[56:36] I think the tapes is off now. I just got
[56:38] about three or four minutes. I want to
[56:39] talk to you. Is that all right? He said,
[56:41] "Now, this is just personal. I like when
[56:42] prophets are personal." Tell me your
[56:44] personal thoughts. That's what I want to
[56:47] know.
[56:48] All right,
[56:51] I just got about three. Okay. Yeah. Now,
[56:54] that's going to be so tremendous. He
[56:56] said, I think I just better say it now.
[56:59] I was uh you know, I got a little wife
[57:01] that I love. That's Mida. And I would
[57:03] not have even married her because of my
[57:05] love for my first wife. And yet, as much
[57:07] as I care for her, I wouldn't have
[57:08] married her if it hadn't been God told
[57:09] me to do it.
[57:11] Now, I'm going to skip ahead till we get
[57:13] to the story here.
[57:15] He said, "I want to tell you a little
[57:16] something happened. This was a dream. I
[57:18] was asleep and now I've never told this
[57:20] publicly before. I told to a couple
[57:21] people but never publicly before as I
[57:23] know of. I dreamed about a month after
[57:25] that that I was standing one day and I
[57:27] was watching the great time. Not the
[57:28] judgment. Now,
[57:31] this ain't the judgment. This ain't the
[57:32] white throne judgment. He said, "I don't
[57:35] believe the church ever comes. I mean,
[57:36] the bride goes to a judgment, but I was
[57:38] there when the crowns was being given
[57:40] out." That's 1 Corinthians 13. I'm
[57:44] sorry. 1 Corinthians 3 where every man
[57:46] must stand before the judgment seat of
[57:48] Christ. That's the crowns for the
[57:51] believer, the bride, the Holy Ghost
[57:53] filled. Praise God. Every man has to
[57:55] give an account at that at that seat.
[57:58] So, see what brother's saying. The dream
[58:00] was of the crowns being given out. So,
[58:02] this is sometime after the rapture. Now,
[58:04] you might know the order better than me.
[58:05] I don't I don't know exactly know the
[58:07] order, but I know we're going to meet
[58:08] him in the air and we're going to the
[58:10] wedding supper. But, I don't know if the
[58:11] supper's before the crowns. I don't know
[58:13] if the crowns are before the supper. I
[58:15] don't know that. But I do know there's
[58:18] going to be crowns given out. Amen. And
[58:20] the great big throne set up there and
[58:22] Jesus and the recording angel. Can you
[58:23] imagine that? A recording angel. And
[58:25] he's recording tonight. Hallelujah. He's
[58:27] watching us tonight. Get ready for
[58:29] communion. Amen. And all standing there
[58:31] and there was a stair steps coming down
[58:33] this way of white ivory. Picture that. A
[58:36] white ivory stair step. He said run down
[58:39] a circle and made a panoramic. Can you
[58:42] see a white circle stairs? You know,
[58:43] beautiful ivory white my
[58:47] And so that all this great host standing
[58:48] out there could see what was happening.
[58:50] So huge stairs so everybody in the
[58:52] audience could see everybody walk up to
[58:54] Christ's throne. And I was standing back
[58:57] over way back on one side. I was just
[58:58] standing there. I never had an idea I
[59:01] had to walk them steps myself. I was
[59:04] standing there. I'd seen a recording
[59:05] angel would call a certain name. And I
[59:07] know I recognize that name. And I look
[59:08] way back out. Here come the brother
[59:10] walking. And the recorded angel standing
[59:12] there by the side of Christ just a dream
[59:13] now and was watching and their names was
[59:16] on there. It was found in the book of
[59:17] life. He looked over at them and say it
[59:20] was well done my good and faithful
[59:21] servant. Now enter in. So to me this
[59:24] might be before the wedding supper. I
[59:26] don't know.
[59:27] I look back where they was all going and
[59:29] there was a new world in the joys. Enter
[59:32] in the the joys the Lord has been uh for
[59:35] yours since the foundation of the world.
[59:39] Now, I'm sorry, this one is so small.
[59:40] Please, I mean, maybe just close your
[59:42] eyes. I didn't mean to do this. And I
[59:44] thought, oh, they go through there and
[59:46] meet one another and just rejoicing and
[59:48] going over mountains and great big
[59:50] places. Can you imagine that? There's a
[59:51] gate. There's Christ there on the
[59:53] stairs. And then behind that, Brother
[59:54] Ram can see mountains and places. And he
[59:57] watches them go in and they're just
[59:58] they're they're walking up by the
[1:00:00] mountains, you know? They're just in
[1:00:01] this beautiful place. Amen.
[1:00:04] And I say, "Glory, hallelujah." Just
[1:00:06] he's jumping up and down. Weren't we
[1:00:07] jumping tonight? And there he is at the
[1:00:10] judgment seat of Christ jumping up and
[1:00:11] down saying, "Brother Neville got in."
[1:00:14] Hallelujah. You'll be jumping. Brother
[1:00:16] Jesse got in. Brother so and so. Sister
[1:00:18] so and so got in. Why? Because it's the
[1:00:21] greatest moment of our lives. Amen.
[1:00:24] So have Christ say, "Well done, sister
[1:00:26] so and so. Well done, brother so and
[1:00:27] so."
[1:00:29] He said, "I hear another name called and
[1:00:31] oh, I know him. I know him. There he
[1:00:33] goes there. Watch him right up. Enter in
[1:00:35] the joys of the Lord, my good and
[1:00:36] faithful. Oh, praise God. Praise God.
[1:00:38] Just think, they would say, Orman
[1:00:40] Neville. I'd say, that's old brother
[1:00:41] Neville. There he is. And here he comes
[1:00:43] out of the crowd, goes up. I hear him
[1:00:45] say, "Enter in the joys that's been
[1:00:46] prepared for you since the foundation of
[1:00:48] the world. Enter in." And old brother
[1:00:50] Neville changed. And just start back in
[1:00:52] there just screaming and hollering.
[1:00:55] Oh my. Can you imagine? And we're
[1:00:58] maniacs here. Think about the maniacs
[1:00:59] will be there. Amen. Screaming and
[1:01:02] shouting. Brother's jumping. Brother
[1:01:04] Neville got in. Hallelujah. Walking up
[1:01:07] the thrones before. Now, is anybody
[1:01:09] worthy? No. But it's the blood of Jesus.
[1:01:11] Amen. It's the indwelling of the Holy
[1:01:13] Spirit that changed our lives and made
[1:01:16] us worthy.
[1:01:18] Hallelujah.
[1:01:21] And boy, I just shout and say, "Glory to
[1:01:23] God, standing over here by myself having
[1:01:26] a wonderful time watching my brethren go
[1:01:27] in." And a recording angel stood and
[1:01:30] said, "William Brandham."
[1:01:33] And I never thought I'd have to walk
[1:01:35] that stairst step. So then I was scared.
[1:01:38] I thought, "Oh my, would I have to do
[1:01:40] that?" So you can tell it's a dream,
[1:01:41] right? Because there's fear. It wasn't
[1:01:43] actual translation. It was a dream,
[1:01:45] right? And everybody pat Now look. So I
[1:01:48] went down there and everybody pat me on
[1:01:49] the back saying, "Hi, brother Bam. God
[1:01:50] bless you, brother Bam. Pat me as I go
[1:01:52] along through a big crowd of people. All
[1:01:54] them reaching over, God bless you,
[1:01:55] brother. God bless you." It's like a
[1:01:56] It's like a big awards ceremony.
[1:01:59] You see that, you know, they did it last
[1:02:01] night for the football. while they gave
[1:02:02] out all their awards and everybody's
[1:02:03] clapping and standing. That is just a
[1:02:05] perversion of what's going to happen at
[1:02:07] the great white I'm sorry at the
[1:02:08] judgment seat of Christ. Amen. Just a a
[1:02:11] perversion where they all say, "God
[1:02:13] bless you, sister and so and so. You
[1:02:14] made it, brother so and so. God bless
[1:02:16] you." Say, "Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:02:18] you. Oh my." And I was going I was
[1:02:21] saying, "Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:02:22] you." Like coming out of a meeting or
[1:02:24] something, you know, and I was going to
[1:02:26] have to walk some of these great big
[1:02:28] ivory steps.
[1:02:30] And I started walking up through there
[1:02:32] and just as I made it through the first
[1:02:33] step, I thought and I looked at his
[1:02:35] face, Christ face. I thought, I want to
[1:02:37] get get a good look at him this way. And
[1:02:39] I stopped and I had my hands like this.
[1:02:42] I felt something slipping my arm there.
[1:02:44] It was somebody else's arm. I looked
[1:02:45] around and there stood hope. Those big
[1:02:47] black eyes and that dark hair hanging
[1:02:49] down her back, white robe on looking up
[1:02:51] at me like that.
[1:02:54] And I said, "Hope." I felt something hit
[1:02:57] this arm. Looked around and there was
[1:02:59] me. the dark eyes looking up and the
[1:03:01] black hair hanging down and a white robe
[1:03:02] on. I said, "Mita." And they looked at
[1:03:04] me and they looked at one another, you
[1:03:06] know, and I got them in my arms and here
[1:03:08] we went. Home. Home. Is that your home,
[1:03:11] church? Where the mountains and the
[1:03:13] hills and the gates of heaven, that's my
[1:03:15] home. Hallelujah. This ain't my home.
[1:03:17] I'm going home. Hallelujah. And then our
[1:03:19] home will come down to be a part of this
[1:03:21] home. Hallelujah. And I woke up and I
[1:03:24] got up and I sat down a chair and cried.
[1:03:25] You know, I thought, "Oh, God, I hope
[1:03:27] that comes like that." Both associated
[1:03:30] with me in life and bringing up
[1:03:32] children, things like that. And here we
[1:03:33] are walking into the new world. Oh my,
[1:03:35] where perfection everything.
[1:03:37] Why? It's going to be a wonderful thing.
[1:03:38] Don't miss it. Don't miss it. By the
[1:03:40] grace of God, do all you can do and then
[1:03:42] it'll be up to God to take care of the
[1:03:44] rest. Look at that wisdom. Do all you
[1:03:46] can do. Work with all your love for
[1:03:48] Jesus and God will take care of the
[1:03:50] rest. Oh, glory. Let's go to Revelation
[1:03:52] 7 since you were already there last
[1:03:53] time. Revelation 7 verse 9.
[1:03:59] This is a picture of the gentile um
[1:04:02] church before the throne of God. And I
[1:04:05] want you to see what I don't know if
[1:04:06] we're going to do this before we enter
[1:04:08] in, probably after.
[1:04:10] But at some point, we're going to be
[1:04:12] doing this or perhaps this is going on
[1:04:13] now. I'm not sure. But one thing I know
[1:04:16] in verse 7, I'm sorry, in verse 15, go
[1:04:20] to Revelation 7:15. I don't have the
[1:04:23] slides for this one, so sorry. I'm just
[1:04:24] going to leave that up there because I
[1:04:25] like that quote.
[1:04:26] I like that. Therefore, now here's the
[1:04:29] Gentile people. Therefore, are they
[1:04:31] before the throne of God and serve him
[1:04:34] day and night in his temple, and he that
[1:04:38] siteth among them, I'm sorry, on the
[1:04:40] throne shall dwell among them.
[1:04:43] Now, let's go back to verse 9. So, let's
[1:04:45] see. So, let me place this here. We can
[1:04:47] know when this takes place. This is not
[1:04:49] the future home because in the future
[1:04:50] home there's no day or night anymore.
[1:04:53] Are you with me church? Hallelujah. So
[1:04:55] we're either getting a picture of the
[1:04:58] sixth dimension with this or this is
[1:05:00] right after some time in the marriage
[1:05:01] supper of the lamb. Oh glory. But this
[1:05:04] is not the future home. This is not when
[1:05:06] the see when the city comes down because
[1:05:08] there's no day or night in there because
[1:05:10] there's no more sun. Christ is the light
[1:05:12] thereof. Amen. He's the light. Look at
[1:05:15] verse nine.
[1:05:17] And this is after the sealing of the
[1:05:18] 144,000. So I imagine this would be
[1:05:20] during the marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:05:22] And after this I beheld low a great
[1:05:23] multitude which no man could number of
[1:05:25] all nations. That can't be Jews. That
[1:05:27] has to be Gentiles
[1:05:29] and kindreds and peoples and tongues.
[1:05:31] And stood before the throne.
[1:05:34] Oh. Before the lamb clothed with white
[1:05:36] robes and palms in their hands. So see
[1:05:38] all those palms that were there when
[1:05:39] Jesus uh came into Jerusalem. We've got
[1:05:42] perfected palms up in heaven. Amen.
[1:05:44] We're still praising that glorious lamb
[1:05:46] with palms. And now look, what else did
[1:05:49] these Gentiles do? Verse 10, they cried
[1:05:51] with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation to
[1:05:54] our God, which siteth upon the throne
[1:05:56] and unto the Lamb."
[1:05:59] And all the angels stood round about the
[1:06:00] throne, and about the elders, and the
[1:06:02] four beasts, and fell before the throne
[1:06:04] on their faces, and worship God. What a
[1:06:08] picture. Amen. They the God is so holy.
[1:06:10] Jesus is so wonderful. They can't even
[1:06:12] face him. They got to fall down on their
[1:06:14] faces and worship God, saying, "Amen.
[1:06:18] Blessing and glory and wisdom and
[1:06:19] thanksgiving and honor and power and
[1:06:21] might be unto our God forever and ever.
[1:06:24] Amen."
[1:06:26] And one of the elders answered, saying
[1:06:27] unto me, "What are these that are raided
[1:06:29] in white robes? And whence came they?"
[1:06:30] And I said unto him, "Sir, thou
[1:06:32] knowest?" And he said to me, "These are
[1:06:35] they which came out of great
[1:06:36] tribulation, and have washed their
[1:06:38] robes, and made them white in the blood
[1:06:40] of the lamb." Now, this is not the the
[1:06:42] great tribulation. This is just the
[1:06:44] tribulation that saints go through.
[1:06:46] Every nation, there's every nation,
[1:06:47] there Gentiles in every nation, and
[1:06:49] every every believer goes through great
[1:06:51] persecution. Can you say amen to that?
[1:06:53] Your persecution might not be physical
[1:06:55] yet, but you do go through persecution.
[1:06:58] Absolutely. Praise God. Demons try to
[1:07:00] discourage you, family members, uh
[1:07:02] workers, everybody around you trying to
[1:07:04] persecute you to, uh discourage you. And
[1:07:06] you got to stand there like the Rock of
[1:07:08] Ages. You got to be faithful. Amen.
[1:07:10] persevere.
[1:07:12] And then ver verse 15, they stand before
[1:07:15] his throne, serve him day and night in
[1:07:17] his temple. And he that sitth on the
[1:07:19] throne shall dwell among them.
[1:07:21] They shall hunger no more, neither
[1:07:22] thirst anymore, neither shall this the
[1:07:24] sun light on them, nor any heat. For the
[1:07:26] lamb which is in the midst of the throne
[1:07:28] shall feed them, and he shall lead them
[1:07:30] unto living fountains of waters, and God
[1:07:32] shall wipe away all tears from their
[1:07:34] eyes. How many like that? By God's
[1:07:36] grace. Hallelujah. Now,
[1:07:42] this is what we just saw. The gentile
[1:07:44] ministry before the heavenly throne.
[1:07:46] Now, like I said, I don't know if that's
[1:07:48] happening right now. Uh I don't know if
[1:07:50] it's happening after the marriage supper
[1:07:52] of the or in the marriage supper of the
[1:07:53] lamb. It seems like marriage supper of
[1:07:54] the lamb because it says after this
[1:07:55] after the 144,000 are sealed. It seems
[1:07:57] like that's something going on uh after
[1:08:00] the or sometime during the marriage
[1:08:01] supper of the lamb. Now,
[1:08:04] I want you to see this. What happens at
[1:08:06] God's throne is different than what we
[1:08:07] think. Let's go to Revelation 19.
[1:08:10] I kind of preached on this, you know,
[1:08:11] back in Napoleon, but I'm using a
[1:08:13] different text for this one. Look at
[1:08:14] Revelation 19
[1:08:16] verse one. And this is quite sobering,
[1:08:19] but I want you to try to understand this
[1:08:20] here that God's throne, everything at
[1:08:23] God's throne is just perfect. They don't
[1:08:25] have human feelings. They have divine
[1:08:27] feelings.
[1:08:29] But look at this thought. Verse one. And
[1:08:31] after these things, I heard a great
[1:08:33] voice to much people in heaven, saying,
[1:08:35] Allelujah, salvation and glory, and
[1:08:37] honor and power unto the Lord our God.
[1:08:41] For true and righteous are his
[1:08:42] judgments. For he hath judged the great
[1:08:44] which did corrupt the earth with
[1:08:46] her fornication, and hath avenged the
[1:08:48] blood of his servants at her hand. Did
[1:08:51] you catch that? I want to just kind of
[1:08:53] sober us up and get us to understand
[1:08:55] this.
[1:08:56] when Russia drops the bomb on Vatican
[1:08:58] which brother Babam said was thus sayith
[1:09:00] the Lord right the is judged and
[1:09:04] in heaven at that time can you ma on
[1:09:05] earth can you imagine the screaming
[1:09:07] going on and all the all the people
[1:09:09] wailing and all the awful things
[1:09:11] happening there at the very time that's
[1:09:13] happening heaven is saying hallelujah
[1:09:16] praise our God can you look at can you
[1:09:18] imagine think about that that world is
[1:09:21] so far beyond our feelings and our
[1:09:23] thoughts are you with
[1:09:26] And the Bible said that that they all
[1:09:28] shout this. They all say this.
[1:09:29] Allelujah. And look at verse three. And
[1:09:31] again they said allelujah. And her smoke
[1:09:33] rose up forever and ever. Heaven is
[1:09:36] saying praise our God. Praise our God.
[1:09:38] Praise our God. And on the earth the
[1:09:40] tribulation, all this awful things are
[1:09:42] happening. So it shows us that we need
[1:09:44] to have the mind of God. Amen. We must
[1:09:47] have the mind of God. We must be mindful
[1:09:49] of what's going on in heaven even right
[1:09:50] now. If things look awful down here,
[1:09:53] that don't mean heaven's not having
[1:09:54] revival. Amen. If people are getting
[1:09:56] saved, angels are rejoicing. Amen. If
[1:09:58] people are getting filled with the Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost, angels are playing harps.
[1:10:01] Remember that. That's in the scripture.
[1:10:03] When people get the Holy Ghost, angels
[1:10:05] play harps. Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] Hallelujah. So, even though a world
[1:10:09] might look like it's in chaos, all chaos
[1:10:11] is broken loose, if people are getting
[1:10:13] saved or anywhere around the world,
[1:10:15] heaven is having a worship ceremony.
[1:10:16] Amen. And then sometimes we get
[1:10:19] discouraged and get down and don't even
[1:10:20] realize heaven's rejoicing. Oh God, help
[1:10:23] us to have the mindset of heaven. Are
[1:10:25] you with me? Let's go there. Revelation
[1:10:28] uh 14, I believe it is.
[1:10:33] Yeah. Revelation 14.
[1:10:35] Yes, sir.
[1:10:38] This is what I ended the sermon on in
[1:10:40] the point. I was just jumping around. I
[1:10:41] was ah this this thought is a beautiful
[1:10:43] thought. Oh, now here's 144,000 getting
[1:10:46] sealed. I love this word. And I looked
[1:10:48] and lo, a lamb stood on the Mount Zion.
[1:10:50] So I'm taking you to the after the
[1:10:51] tribulation period. Christ is standing
[1:10:53] on Mount Zion in Jerusalem with 144,000
[1:10:56] around him
[1:10:59] and with him 144,000 having his father's
[1:11:01] name written in their foreheads. What's
[1:11:02] that? The baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:05] Right there. That's in Revelation
[1:11:06] chapter 7. They're all baptized with the
[1:11:08] Holy Ghost. Christ is standing with his
[1:11:10] church born that the Bible said there'd
[1:11:12] be a nation born in a day. Oh,
[1:11:14] hallelujah. And there he is standing
[1:11:16] with this new nation. They're all filled
[1:11:18] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:20] And I heard a voice from heaven as a
[1:11:23] sound of many waters. So it's a loud
[1:11:24] noise. Right after they get the Holy
[1:11:26] Ghost, there's a loud noise in heaven.
[1:11:28] Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] As a voice of a great thunder. So John's
[1:11:32] hearing what's going on in heaven while
[1:11:34] they're rejoicing and praising the lamb
[1:11:35] on earth. And it's like thunder,
[1:11:37] brother. It's like loud voices, church.
[1:11:40] It's like waters in heaven. All the
[1:11:42] rejoicing, all the worship service going
[1:11:44] on in heaven. And amen.
[1:11:46] Oh, hallelujah. Verse two. And I heard a
[1:11:48] voice from heaven as a voice of many
[1:11:50] waters.
[1:11:51] And the I read that verse Yeah.
[1:11:53] finishing verse two. And I heard the
[1:11:55] voice of harpers harping with their
[1:11:57] harps.
[1:11:59] Remember this is after the tribulation
[1:12:01] period. This is after the seven vows.
[1:12:03] This is after the seven trumpets. This
[1:12:05] is after all these judgments have gone
[1:12:07] forth. The 144,000 are sealed. And man,
[1:12:10] you most of the world's, you know, sad
[1:12:12] and all the destruction, all these
[1:12:13] things like that. And yet 144,000 just
[1:12:16] got the Holy Ghost and heaven breaks out
[1:12:19] the instruments and it's time to worship
[1:12:20] God. It's time to give God glory.
[1:12:23] 144,000 people were sealed with the Holy
[1:12:25] Ghost. Love this.
[1:12:28] And they sung as it were a new song
[1:12:30] before the throne and before the four
[1:12:32] beasts and the elders. And no man could
[1:12:34] learn that song but the 144,000
[1:12:37] and which were redeemed from the earth.
[1:12:38] Now look at verse four. is beautiful.
[1:12:40] Now, I'm sorry. Go to verse five. And
[1:12:42] their mouth was found no guile, for they
[1:12:44] are without fault before the throne of
[1:12:46] God. That to me was the most important
[1:12:49] scripture. Yes, heaven's having a
[1:12:51] worship service. Yes, the angels are
[1:12:53] rejoicing. Yes, the harps are harping up
[1:12:55] in heaven, destruction on earth, but
[1:12:57] there's one little revival going on on
[1:12:59] Mount Zion. And all heaven's breaking
[1:13:01] out the instruments, praising the Lord.
[1:13:04] And because they got the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:05] brother and sister, they have no fault
[1:13:07] before the throne of God. How many want
[1:13:10] to be filled with the Holy Ghost or
[1:13:11] believe they're filled with the Holy
[1:13:12] Ghost? If you are, if you have that, or
[1:13:14] if you're going to get it, you have no
[1:13:16] faults before the throne of God. Amen.
[1:13:19] No one, no demon can lay any fault to
[1:13:21] anybody who's got the mark of the Father
[1:13:23] in their foreheads, the baptism of the
[1:13:25] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Like that by
[1:13:27] God's grace. Oh my, that's striking to
[1:13:30] me.
[1:13:32] See, this is how heaven's throne reacts
[1:13:35] to the judgment of the great And
[1:13:36] then that was in 19, now 14. That's how
[1:13:38] heaven reacts. When the people get the
[1:13:40] Holy Ghost, the harpers start harping.
[1:13:42] Angels start rejoicing. We start, we
[1:13:44] rejoicing. And it's all God's children
[1:13:46] coming back to the redeemed condition.
[1:13:49] Oh my. That's exactly right. Hallelujah.
[1:13:53] Now, let's look at this here. I want to
[1:13:54] bring this down to close. I want to do
[1:13:56] two things.
[1:13:58] two thoughts here and then I want to
[1:14:00] close with a talent thought.
[1:14:02] Christ remains in ministry serving even
[1:14:05] now
[1:14:06] because I'm going to close with how
[1:14:07] you're faithful servant.
[1:14:10] How many know brother was a servant? How
[1:14:12] many know he left his family to be a
[1:14:14] servant? Sometimes I got to leave my
[1:14:15] family. Last night I had to leave my
[1:14:16] family to go serve and it's hard. It's
[1:14:19] hard on my wife sometimes. Brother,
[1:14:20] brother brother Bram would leave for
[1:14:22] weeks, months
[1:14:25] and uh in 60 in the question answer 64
[1:14:27] you can hear brother it caused a little
[1:14:29] tension in the family. Brother Brandham
[1:14:30] said he tried to sit down and talk with
[1:14:31] his wife and say I love you and she said
[1:14:32] no you don't
[1:14:35] see we're all human aren't we because
[1:14:38] he's gone so long and brother Bam said
[1:14:39] he'd come back and uh he said then he
[1:14:42] want to go out and get away from her.
[1:14:43] That's exactly that's what you can
[1:14:44] listen to that on the tapes.
[1:14:46] He says I love you ma'am. She said no
[1:14:48] you don't. See, she's going through some
[1:14:49] some trials.
[1:14:51] Any ministry for God will call you to
[1:14:53] sacrifice. Sometimes if it's a real
[1:14:55] ministry for God, you have to sacrifice.
[1:14:59] But see, in our service, we must always
[1:15:02] remember that Christ is serving us at
[1:15:04] the same time. We're not the only one
[1:15:06] servant. He's serving us. Now, the Bible
[1:15:10] said this in Hebrews 12:2, "Looking unto
[1:15:12] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[1:15:13] faith, who for the joy that was set
[1:15:14] before him, endured the cross, despising
[1:15:17] the shame, and is sat down at the right
[1:15:19] hand of the throne of God." Here's his
[1:15:22] heavenly ministry.
[1:15:25] And notice right now, he's on the
[1:15:26] father's throne. When he gets on earth,
[1:15:28] he's on his throne. Praise God. To him
[1:15:32] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:15:34] me in my throne. That's speaking of
[1:15:35] either the millennium or the future
[1:15:38] home. Even also as I overcame and am set
[1:15:41] down with my father in his throne.
[1:15:44] Heaven is the father's throne. Earth is
[1:15:46] the son's throne. It's exactly right.
[1:15:51] Now look what the Bible said. Did you
[1:15:52] know Hannah said this? Look what Hannah
[1:15:54] said. Hannah said, "The Lord maketh poor
[1:15:55] and maketh rich. He bringeth low and
[1:15:58] liftth up. He raised up the poor of the
[1:16:00] dust and lifted up the beggar from the
[1:16:02] dung hill to set them among princes and
[1:16:05] to make them inherit the throne of
[1:16:08] glory.
[1:16:10] Glory. He takes the lowest of the low.
[1:16:13] They sat on dung hills. What kind of
[1:16:14] hills did you sit on? He takes the
[1:16:17] lowest of the lows and raise them up.
[1:16:19] And they get to sit on the throne of
[1:16:20] glory. They get to sit with Christ in
[1:16:22] his throne. That's a God I want to
[1:16:24] serve. Amen. Who can take the lowest of
[1:16:26] the low and raise him to the highest of
[1:16:28] the high. Amen.
[1:16:30] For the pillars of the earth are the
[1:16:31] lords, and he has set the world upon
[1:16:32] them. He will keep the feet of his
[1:16:34] saints,
[1:16:36] and the wicked shall be silent in
[1:16:37] darkness. For by strength shall no man
[1:16:40] prevail. See their own human strength.
[1:16:42] Not by might, not by power, but by my
[1:16:44] spirit, sayeth the Lord. That's how we
[1:16:46] overcome every time.
[1:16:49] So Jesus is sitting on the father's
[1:16:51] throne right now. And the Bible said
[1:16:54] this, we have such a high priest who's
[1:16:57] on the right hand of the throne.
[1:16:58] Majesty, a minister of the sanctuary. So
[1:17:01] right now, Christ is in a sanctuary
[1:17:03] where he's ministering.
[1:17:05] That means he's serving. Doesn't doesn't
[1:17:07] minister mean servant? He's serving in
[1:17:09] the sanctuary of heaven and of the true
[1:17:11] tabernacle which the Lord pitched and
[1:17:14] not man.
[1:17:16] Oh, hallelujah. Remember, he's we we're
[1:17:18] supposed to serve, but remember, he's
[1:17:20] really the one serving us. You like
[1:17:21] that?
[1:17:23] the minister of the true tabernacle, the
[1:17:26] true sanctuary.
[1:17:28] Hallelujah. This I'll tell you, church,
[1:17:30] this just encourages me because I come
[1:17:32] and I try to serve and I try to serve
[1:17:34] every week and things like that, but
[1:17:35] really he's the one serving me.
[1:17:38] I just got a little small little talent.
[1:17:42] I got one little talent, which is
[1:17:43] $52,000 if you if you want to know that.
[1:17:45] We'll get to that a little bit. That's
[1:17:47] all it is. I just got one talent and
[1:17:50] I've just got to be faithful and invest
[1:17:52] in that talent and I've got to double it
[1:17:54] to receive a full reward.
[1:17:56] I got to give everything I can to this
[1:17:58] investment that he gave me. I got to put
[1:18:00] all my time, all my focus, all my energy
[1:18:02] into and bring forth one more talent.
[1:18:06] I get a full reward. Amen.
[1:18:09] Hebrews 8, go down to verse six. But now
[1:18:13] hath he obtained a more excellent
[1:18:14] ministry. This is a be better than
[1:18:16] ministry of Aaron.
[1:18:19] by how much also he is the mediator. So
[1:18:23] he's in the ministry of mediation.
[1:18:26] He's in the ministry of going between
[1:18:28] two groups or two individuals, the
[1:18:30] father and us. Amen. He ministers
[1:18:34] between both of us
[1:18:36] of a better covenant which established
[1:18:38] upon better promises. Hallelujah.
[1:18:43] Hebrews 7. But this man, because he
[1:18:45] continuth ever, hath an unchangeable
[1:18:47] priesthood. Wherefore he is able to save
[1:18:49] them to the uttermost that come unto God
[1:18:52] by him, by Christ, seeing he ever liveth
[1:18:55] to maketh intercession for them.
[1:18:58] Hallelujah. He lives to make
[1:19:01] intercession for your prayers, for my
[1:19:03] prayers. He lives. That's what he's
[1:19:05] doing. He's ministering in uh mediation.
[1:19:08] Hallelujah. He's a servant of a
[1:19:10] mediation.
[1:19:12] We pray. The Bible said we pray to the
[1:19:14] high priest and the Bible said he makes
[1:19:16] intercession to the eternal spirit for
[1:19:17] us. Hallelujah. Is this the will of the
[1:19:20] father? Father, is this your will?
[1:19:22] Father, is it your will to heal brother
[1:19:23] Adam or is it your will to heal brother
[1:19:25] Jesse or save who so and so? Is it your
[1:19:27] will? He lives to make intercession for
[1:19:30] our prayers. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:35] So I want to just establish that. And
[1:19:37] then we have a ministry to the heavenly
[1:19:39] throne.
[1:19:42] Now the we know the scripture the word
[1:19:44] of God is quick powerful but look at
[1:19:46] verse 13. All things are naked and open
[1:19:49] under the eyes of him with whom we have
[1:19:50] to do. So from heaven's throne he sees
[1:19:53] everything as it really is. There's
[1:19:55] really no pretenders when God's looking
[1:19:57] down. People can pretend to come to
[1:19:59] church or pretend whatever, but the word
[1:20:01] of God cuts through and it leaves
[1:20:03] everything exposed to what it actually
[1:20:05] is.
[1:20:06] Seeing then that we have a great high
[1:20:08] priest that has passed into the heavens.
[1:20:10] Jesus the son of God. Let us hold fast
[1:20:12] our profession. Keep quoting the word.
[1:20:15] Keep standing on the promise. For we
[1:20:17] have not a high priest which cannot be
[1:20:20] touched
[1:20:21] with the feeling of our infirmities but
[1:20:23] was all points tempted like as we are
[1:20:25] yet without sin.
[1:20:28] So see he was made to be touched. He's
[1:20:31] there to be touched. Our ministry is
[1:20:33] touching the high priest. Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] And you touch him through prayer. You
[1:20:38] touch him through faith. We must touch
[1:20:39] him all the time. Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] Let us therefore come boldly, not meek
[1:20:45] or or not weakly or not doubt doubtedly
[1:20:48] but boldly unto the throne of grace that
[1:20:51] we may obtain mercy and find grace to
[1:20:53] help in the time of need. Don't you love
[1:20:55] that? By God's grace. So our ministry is
[1:20:58] to come boldly before that throne where
[1:21:01] he lives to serve us and to touch his
[1:21:04] heart, to touch his will, to touch him.
[1:21:06] Hallelujah. That's what we're supposed
[1:21:08] to do. Hallelujah. Is touch the grace of
[1:21:10] God. Touch the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:21:15] Look what the Bible said. He said,
[1:21:17] "Don't be carried away with diverse and
[1:21:18] strange doctrines. For it's a good thing
[1:21:20] that the heart be established with
[1:21:22] grace, not with meats." Speaking of
[1:21:23] Aaron and the Jews, which have not
[1:21:25] profited them that have been occupied
[1:21:27] therein. We have an altar, don't we? We
[1:21:31] have an altar. That's why there's got to
[1:21:33] be a lamb there. Wherefore, they have no
[1:21:35] right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
[1:21:38] for the see you see they don't have a
[1:21:39] right the Jews don't have a right to go
[1:21:41] there because they don't believe in the
[1:21:42] sacrifice but we have a right to go
[1:21:45] there we can go to the tabernacle the
[1:21:47] true tabernacle we can approach the true
[1:21:49] high priest amen and we can touch him
[1:21:52] with our prayers
[1:21:54] oh glory
[1:21:56] look at verse uh but I'll skip past that
[1:21:59] I just want to bring out that we have an
[1:22:00] altar the Jews have no right to approach
[1:22:02] to this altar but we have a right to go
[1:22:04] there because we believe in the blood of
[1:22:07] Jesus Christ.
[1:22:09] All right.
[1:22:11] Now,
[1:22:15] here's what the Bible said. By him,
[1:22:16] therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of
[1:22:18] praise to God continually. That is the
[1:22:20] fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his
[1:22:22] name. So, all heaven, uh, Jesus is up
[1:22:24] there waiting for us to give thanks.
[1:22:26] He's waiting for us to profess the right
[1:22:28] profession. He's waiting for us to say
[1:22:31] the right thing. How many want to say
[1:22:32] the right thing? That's how you touch
[1:22:33] him. We saw that with Jacob this
[1:22:35] morning. He kept quoting God's promise.
[1:22:36] I'm not worthy, but deliver me. He was
[1:22:38] touching heaven and heaven touched him.
[1:22:41] There it is. Glory. If you touch heaven,
[1:22:43] heaven will touch you, too. Amen. Oh,
[1:22:46] thank you, Jesus. Now,
[1:22:49] let me see how many I got left on here.
[1:22:52] I had a few more. Okay. And I already
[1:22:54] read over those. Okay. My plan was to
[1:22:56] get to those. Okay. Malachi, you can
[1:22:58] switch it off. I'm gonna turn it back to
[1:23:00] the I'm gonna
[1:23:03] Is that Switch back?
[1:23:08] I'm going to um pull up some other
[1:23:10] quotes. I'm going to finish with this.
[1:23:11] Let's go to Matthew 25.
[1:23:15] Yeah, there's my another notes. I didn't
[1:23:16] have time to put those on slides.
[1:23:18] There's only so many hours in the day. I
[1:23:19] try to labor and I come here every
[1:23:21] morning on Saturday and pray and fast
[1:23:23] and try to get in the spirit. There just
[1:23:24] ain't enough time in the day. I got one
[1:23:27] good one though, but by God's grace.
[1:23:29] Matthew 25:14. Let's go there. We'll
[1:23:31] close with this one. Rewards for the
[1:23:33] faithful. Rewards for the faithful.
[1:23:39] 25:14.
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:56] Now, I just want to bring a thought out
[1:23:57] of this that uh I believe I had by God's
[1:24:00] grace. Believe it's from the Lord.
[1:24:02] Matthew 25:14.
[1:24:04] For the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[1:24:06] traveling into a far country who hath
[1:24:08] called his own servants and delivered
[1:24:09] unto them his goods. This is of course
[1:24:11] like of Christ going to heaven traveling
[1:24:13] away physically. And unto one he gave
[1:24:16] five talents to another two and to
[1:24:17] another one. To every man according to
[1:24:19] his several ability and straightway took
[1:24:22] his journey. So God gave everybody
[1:24:25] exactly what he knew they could do. What
[1:24:27] they could handle. Praise God.
[1:24:31] God's not going to give you something
[1:24:32] you can't handle.
[1:24:34] Now, let me show this here. I went on
[1:24:37] and I went to an inflation calculator,
[1:24:38] okay, for England. Um, I was reading
[1:24:40] Matthew Henry the commentary trying to
[1:24:42] figure out how much money would this be.
[1:24:45] Now, Matthew Henry was in the 1700s and
[1:24:47] he said
[1:24:49] he read uh did some calculations and
[1:24:52] said that one talent of silver for the
[1:24:55] Jews was equal to 353 pounds and 11
[1:24:58] shillings.
[1:25:01] Uh, and now the earliest calculation or
[1:25:05] in uh uh the earliest calculation I
[1:25:08] could do was 1901.
[1:25:10] So there might have been some more
[1:25:11] inflation from 1700 to 1900. But the
[1:25:14] closest I could get to doing the
[1:25:16] inflation uh 353 pounds for the the
[1:25:20] people in England because Matthew Henry
[1:25:21] is from England was would be equal
[1:25:25] to 53,173
[1:25:27] thou or $173. So about $55,000.
[1:25:31] So this is the illustration Jesus gives.
[1:25:34] The first person has about $53,000
[1:25:38] and you go invest that $53,000 and
[1:25:40] double it. Right now he knows what he
[1:25:43] does. We know what he does. He goes into
[1:25:44] the earth and he's scared. Well, I won't
[1:25:46] be able to bring a profit. I won't be
[1:25:47] able to do anything with this. I'm
[1:25:48] scared I'm going to I'm scared I'm going
[1:25:50] to fail. We can't be scared of failing.
[1:25:52] We have to know if God gave me something
[1:25:54] and he gave me the ability to uh invest
[1:25:56] it the right way. Don't bury your gift
[1:25:59] in the church, don't bury your love for
[1:26:00] God or your desire to win souls. Don't
[1:26:02] bury that in the earth. Invest in it.
[1:26:05] Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] Invest in it. Don't bury it. Don't bury
[1:26:08] it in the flesh. Right? Don't let that
[1:26:09] desire be buried in your flesh. bring it
[1:26:12] out and use it. Hallelujah. Be a
[1:26:14] businessman or woman. Christian
[1:26:15] businessman or woman.
[1:26:19] So if that person would have been
[1:26:21] faithful with the one talent, that's why
[1:26:23] I believe I'm a one town preacher. I
[1:26:24] like I think that's good for me because
[1:26:26] if anybody was five talent, it'd be
[1:26:28] brother Brandham. And the church said
[1:26:31] the highest calling in the Bible is
[1:26:33] what? A missionary, an apostle. So the
[1:26:36] highest reward would be for the five
[1:26:38] talent person.
[1:26:41] two talents was equal to about $100,000,
[1:26:44] right? Because 53 plus 53, you know,
[1:26:46] 106. I just leveled it off to 100,000.
[1:26:49] So God Christ expected the one who had
[1:26:51] 100,000 to give him $200,000 when he got
[1:26:54] back.
[1:26:56] Five talents is $266,000.
[1:27:00] And if you double that, you got half a
[1:27:02] million. 532,000.
[1:27:05] Does that give you a picture there? So
[1:27:06] Jesus gives us a picture of what the
[1:27:08] kingdom of heaven is like. It's like
[1:27:09] 53,000 for me.
[1:27:12] It's like for other people it might be
[1:27:14] 100,000 or quarter of a million.
[1:27:18] And Jesus said, "Go invest that. Be
[1:27:21] faithful with that. Don't bury it in the
[1:27:24] earth. Don't be scared about his
[1:27:27] judgments.
[1:27:29] Take God at his word. Invest in your
[1:27:32] gift. Give pour everything you can into
[1:27:35] that and Christ will bless you."
[1:27:38] We don't want to be the unprofitable
[1:27:39] servant because what? He lost all his
[1:27:41] reward. Praise God. What we say? The
[1:27:44] Bible said, "Be careful you don't lose
[1:27:46] your reward. Be careful you don't lose
[1:27:48] your crown." And what kept him back?
[1:27:50] Fear kept him back.
[1:27:53] Fear kept him back. He was scared about
[1:27:55] the judge and oh, I know he's an auster
[1:27:57] man. I know he's really strict with his
[1:27:58] money and everything. Of course, every
[1:28:01] really every every wise man is. Every
[1:28:03] every rich man is. He's got to be
[1:28:05] diligent with his finances. He's got to
[1:28:07] be diligent with his kingdom.
[1:28:09] And he wants you to do something with
[1:28:12] the talents that he gave you.
[1:28:16] So I look at example of this like
[1:28:18] brother Brandham. Brother Brandham had
[1:28:20] five talents.
[1:28:22] He had so many gifts. He could he could
[1:28:25] do all the five-fold ministry, right?
[1:28:27] That's a good one right there. Five
[1:28:28] tales, fivefold ministry. He had all
[1:28:30] five gifts. That's a good thought. I
[1:28:31] never thought about that.
[1:28:34] Wow.
[1:28:35] And he went and used that and went
[1:28:36] around the world seven times and he
[1:28:38] said, "I've already got a million souls
[1:28:39] of Christ. I want to give a million
[1:28:40] more." Amen.
[1:28:43] Praise God. I thought that's a beautiful
[1:28:45] thought.
[1:28:47] So the apostle would have to be the five
[1:28:49] talent because they make new converts.
[1:28:51] They spread the faith. They go after the
[1:28:52] lost sheep. They leave their homes and
[1:28:55] families in order to win souls for
[1:28:56] Christ. That would have to be the
[1:28:58] greatest talent you could have, the
[1:29:00] greatest ability you could have to go
[1:29:02] win souls for the kingdom of God. Amen.
[1:29:05] What What And remember what what did
[1:29:07] Danny Henry say? Remember that? Let's
[1:29:10] read that.
[1:29:14] Danny Henry, remember there was three uh
[1:29:16] people that that interpreted the the the
[1:29:18] the tongues of Danny Henry, the unknown
[1:29:20] tongues. One was a French interpreter,
[1:29:22] one was a UN uh different things like
[1:29:25] that, and one was just a woman that
[1:29:27] spoke French. And here's what it said.
[1:29:29] Thou has walked of thy own choosing,
[1:29:31] thou has picked the correct and precise
[1:29:34] decision, and this is my way with a
[1:29:36] capital M. This is God's way. Because of
[1:29:39] this momentous decision, a huge portion
[1:29:43] of heaven awaits thee. Now, which one of
[1:29:44] these is a huge portion? My it has to be
[1:29:48] the five talent, right?
[1:29:51] He said, "Because thou has chosen the
[1:29:53] narrow path, the harder way, thou has
[1:29:56] not walked according to God's choosing."
[1:29:58] How many could raise your hand and say,
[1:29:59] "I've chosen the harder way. I could
[1:30:00] have had an easier life. I could have
[1:30:02] had an easier thing, but I've chosen
[1:30:04] God's way. It's harder."
[1:30:06] I've chose the harder path. Well, guess
[1:30:08] what? He'll say, "Well done." Brother
[1:30:10] Brandon failed. Even though he chose the
[1:30:12] harder way, he failed every now and
[1:30:13] then. God would forgive him. But he kept
[1:30:15] persevering. He stayed faithful to the
[1:30:17] calling in his life.
[1:30:21] What a glorious decision thou hast made.
[1:30:24] This in in that this is that which will
[1:30:27] give and make come to pass the
[1:30:29] tremendous victory in the love divine.
[1:30:32] What victory was that? That was the
[1:30:34] victory of every Holy Ghostfilled saint
[1:30:36] that was one of his converts up there in
[1:30:38] the sixth dimension that came running to
[1:30:40] him saying, "My precious brother, my
[1:30:41] precious brother." He said, "Are all
[1:30:42] these Brandhams?" No, they're your
[1:30:44] converts to Christ. Amen. Glory. The
[1:30:48] tremendous victory because he preached
[1:30:50] the love of Christ. They received the
[1:30:51] love of Christ and that brought victory
[1:30:53] over sin. That brought victory over the
[1:30:55] world, Satan, and hell and temptation.
[1:30:57] And it was a tremendous victory in
[1:30:59] divine love. Amen.
[1:31:01] Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] I love that.
[1:31:09] I thought of another person who lost
[1:31:10] their reward. Two others. King Saul lost
[1:31:12] his reward. Remember in 1 Samuel, Samuel
[1:31:16] said, "Because you've done this," he
[1:31:17] said, "you've lost all the kingdom." He
[1:31:19] said, 'If you'd have been faithful, the
[1:31:21] kingdom of Israel would have been yours
[1:31:22] forever.
[1:31:24] He lost his reward. But was he saved? He
[1:31:26] was absolutely saved. The fires of the
[1:31:29] test of his life made manifest his
[1:31:31] reward and it was very, very small. It
[1:31:34] was so small in fact that after he died,
[1:31:36] remember they had famine for three years
[1:31:37] because of all his sins. The people
[1:31:40] suffered for three years because of
[1:31:42] Saul's sins. See the fire, the trials
[1:31:45] will manifest what kind of work the
[1:31:47] person did. Help us to come through the
[1:31:49] trials with uh with with shining colors.
[1:31:51] Amen. Glory to come through each trial.
[1:31:55] Keep praising God. Keep the high the the
[1:31:57] profession of the high of the most high.
[1:31:59] Amen. Remember God told Jerobam after uh
[1:32:03] let's read that. Let's go to let's go
[1:32:05] let's go there. Uh, first Kings 11.
[1:32:16] Yeah.
[1:32:19] First Kings 11.
[1:32:29] Go to verse 31. 1 Kings 11:31. Hope
[1:32:32] you're enjoying the word of God tonight.
[1:32:33] Praise the Lord. Verse 31. And he said
[1:32:34] to Jerham, "Take thee 10 pieces, for
[1:32:36] thus sayith the Lord, the God of Israel,
[1:32:38] behold, I'll rent the kingdom out of the
[1:32:39] hand of Solomon, and will give 10 tribes
[1:32:42] to thee." Because Solomon built all
[1:32:44] those idols to his strange wives of
[1:32:46] their gods. God rips the kingdom out of
[1:32:48] his hand. So Solomon lost part of I
[1:32:50] don't know how much of his reward he
[1:32:51] lost, but he lost that kingdom. He lost
[1:32:53] 10 tribes. Of course, he, you know, he
[1:32:56] kept them until he died. But you see, it
[1:32:58] would have went to his uh his heritage
[1:32:59] after him. But God takes the kingdom
[1:33:01] from Solomon.
[1:33:04] Now look, let's go down to verse another
[1:33:06] verse here.
[1:33:09] Verse 37. And I will take thee, and thou
[1:33:11] shalt reign according to all that thy
[1:33:13] soul desires, and shall be king over
[1:33:15] Israel. And it shall be if thou wil
[1:33:17] hearken unto all that I command thee,
[1:33:19] and will walk in my ways, and do that
[1:33:20] which is right in my sight, and to keep
[1:33:22] my statutes and my commandments, as
[1:33:23] David my servant did, that I will be
[1:33:25] with thee, and build thee a sure house,
[1:33:29] as I built for David, and will give
[1:33:30] Israel unto thee. And I will for this
[1:33:33] afflict the seed of David, but not
[1:33:35] forever.
[1:33:37] Solomon sought therefore to kill
[1:33:39] Jerobom. Look at that. Solomon, the
[1:33:40] wisest man that ever was, now he's got a
[1:33:42] murdering spirit on him. Can you see
[1:33:43] that? Look what sin will do. It will
[1:33:46] cause somebody who had the greatest
[1:33:47] wisdom now to have a murderous spirit on
[1:33:49] them, seeking to kill Jerobom because
[1:33:51] God gave Jerobom the kingdoms. He ran
[1:33:53] him out of Solomon's hand, came to him.
[1:33:57] And Jerobom arose and fled into Egypt.
[1:34:00] and Shashak, king of Egypt, and was in
[1:34:02] Egypt until the death of Solomon.
[1:34:07] All right, that's the other one. Okay,
[1:34:10] let me close with a few quotes here.
[1:34:13] Let's take a deep breath. Can we
[1:34:17] give you just a little bit a little bit
[1:34:18] more time here? Let me finish with this
[1:34:20] here.
[1:34:21] 1951 testimony, Los Angeles.
[1:34:27] Brother Bram's telling them how sad he
[1:34:28] is to leave them. He said, 'I dread
[1:34:30] leaving these people.' He's out in Los
[1:34:31] Angeles.
[1:34:38] He's praying. He said, "And Lord, you
[1:34:40] said I drink I will drink more the fruit
[1:34:42] of the vine till I eat and drink a new
[1:34:44] with you in my father's kingdom." When
[1:34:45] we come there to that great wedding
[1:34:47] supper and we look across the table one
[1:34:49] another, oh God, just a slip, a little
[1:34:51] handshake over there while the tears of
[1:34:54] joy rolls down our cheeks. She said, "We
[1:34:56] were reaching across the table, shaking
[1:34:58] hands at the marriage supper and tears
[1:35:01] of joy. The king will come out in his
[1:35:03] beauty and wipe all the tears from our
[1:35:05] eyes and say, "Don't cry. It's all over
[1:35:07] now. There'll be no more healing
[1:35:09] campaigns up there. No more tired,
[1:35:11] restless nights. No more wheelchairs,
[1:35:14] grave, sickness. Oh, for that great
[1:35:16] day." And then you'll say, "Enter into
[1:35:18] the joys of the Lord. Oh, how I long to
[1:35:21] hear that at that day, Father." And now,
[1:35:25] while we're here together and all of us
[1:35:26] longing the same thing, make us true
[1:35:28] stewards,
[1:35:30] may we shape our lives by self-control,
[1:35:33] which is temperance,
[1:35:35] that we'll know by the help of the Holy
[1:35:38] Spirit. Listen, to have full confidence
[1:35:42] that Jesus will say, "Well done, my good
[1:35:45] and faithful servant at that day."
[1:35:49] That was powerful. I'm going to read
[1:35:50] that again.
[1:35:53] May we shape our lives by self-control.
[1:35:56] So not giving into our fleshly lust,
[1:35:59] right? Crucifying the lust of the flesh.
[1:36:01] If we shape our lives by crucifying our
[1:36:03] flesh,
[1:36:05] he said we'll know
[1:36:07] by the help of the Holy Spirit to have
[1:36:09] full confidence that Jesus will say,
[1:36:12] "Well done, my good and faithful
[1:36:14] servant." How many want confidence in
[1:36:16] that? Let's stand to our feet.
[1:36:20] Brother Bam says, "If we live our lives
[1:36:22] by self-control, continually crucifying
[1:36:25] our flesh, we can have a full confidence
[1:36:27] by the Holy Spirit, knowing that when we
[1:36:30] go to that place and my there's a and
[1:36:32] there's that white staircase and the
[1:36:34] throne and there's a gate and there's
[1:36:35] mountains behind, we can have full
[1:36:37] confidence
[1:36:39] and know that he'll say, "Well done, thy
[1:36:42] good and faithful servant."
[1:36:45] And notice what did he say? He said,
[1:36:47] "We're servants.
[1:36:50] We will be servants." Brother Brham
[1:36:52] said, "It's hard to always be a
[1:36:53] servant." How many can say amen to that?
[1:36:54] Amen. I'm not saying this life's going
[1:36:56] to be easy. You chose the harder way.
[1:37:00] And the church age book, Brother Brham,
[1:37:01] says exactly that. He said, "It is hard
[1:37:04] to always be a servant." Amen.
[1:37:08] It's not easy.
[1:37:12] It's hard to be a servant.
[1:37:15] But those who spend and are spent for
[1:37:18] others will one day be seated with him
[1:37:20] in his throne. It's not easy to serve
[1:37:22] all the time. Brother Austin looked at
[1:37:24] me last night. He said, he said, I keep
[1:37:25] bringing up these stories. He said,
[1:37:27] "Brother Jesse," he said, "It must be
[1:37:29] nice to know you got the Holy Ghost." I
[1:37:30] said, "Brother, I can't prove it to
[1:37:31] anybody. I just believe it with all my
[1:37:33] heart." Brother said, "I can't he can't
[1:37:34] prove it to anybody." I said, "I look at
[1:37:36] my life now. Look at that." You know,
[1:37:38] see, we're always got we God always lets
[1:37:41] us battle. He never gets a gets to this
[1:37:43] place where we can be complacent. If you
[1:37:45] could prove to someone you had the Holy
[1:37:46] Ghost, you might get complacent, right?
[1:37:50] That's why he keeps you fighting against
[1:37:52] Jesse Smith or keeps you fighting
[1:37:53] against Adam Rigo and Jose Lopez. He
[1:37:55] keeps you fighting against your worst
[1:37:56] enemy, which is yourself to keep you
[1:37:59] humble. Amen. I said, I can't prove
[1:38:01] that. Brother Bam can't prove that.
[1:38:03] Nobody can prove that in the rapture.
[1:38:05] Your life will prove it. Amen.
[1:38:08] Hallelujah.
[1:38:10] But see how our brother's grown and how
[1:38:11] he wants to be filled with the Holy
[1:38:12] Ghost so basically I want to be filled
[1:38:13] with the Holy Ghost so bad my that's
[1:38:16] what we should desire church each one of
[1:38:18] us to live in such a way and that made
[1:38:20] me humble myself I thought my help me
[1:38:22] Jesus to live closer to you that that if
[1:38:25] I'm not you know cuz I can't prove that
[1:38:26] if I'm not let me get filled if I am let
[1:38:28] me be humble with it praise God and keep
[1:38:31] serving faithfully that he could say
[1:38:33] these words that my life
[1:38:36] would be a life of self-control that I
[1:38:39] can I have full confidence that I know
[1:38:40] Christ will say, "Well done. You took
[1:38:43] that one talent that I gave you. You
[1:38:45] took that one talent and it doubled."
[1:38:49] And he and he said, "Well done, good and
[1:38:52] faithful servant." If we're not serving
[1:38:54] others, God, help us to start tonight by
[1:38:56] God's grace. Our life is a life of
[1:39:00] service, and it's a hard life. We serve
[1:39:02] others. We should not be serving
[1:39:03] ourselves.
[1:39:06] Brother Bam said, "If a man fears he
[1:39:08] might not please God,
[1:39:11] then let him fulfill the word." Amen.
[1:39:16] If you're fearing, well, I don't know if
[1:39:17] God's going to say well done or not. I
[1:39:18] don't know what he's going to say. If
[1:39:19] you're fearing, he said, "Let a man
[1:39:21] fulfill the word of God."
[1:39:24] Let in other words, look at the word of
[1:39:25] God and if you're not obeying something,
[1:39:27] make sure you obey it.
[1:39:30] If a man wonders if he will hear those
[1:39:32] words, well done, good and faithful
[1:39:34] servant, let him fulfill the word of God
[1:39:36] in his life. And assuredly, he will hear
[1:39:39] those words of praise. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:39:44] If you're not, if you're fearful, I
[1:39:45] don't know if he's going to accept me. I
[1:39:46] don't know if I'm going to be faithful
[1:39:47] with my gift or I don't I don't know if
[1:39:48] I'm going to be faithful with my talent,
[1:39:50] then just fulfill God's word with all
[1:39:52] your heart and soul. And he said, "Most
[1:39:54] assuredly, he'll tell you, well done,
[1:39:58] thou good and faithful servant."
[1:40:01] It's hard to be a servant, but if he's
[1:40:03] if he's a servant, we can be servants,
[1:40:05] too, with his help. Let's bow our heads
[1:40:08] here. I'm going to ask Wendy and Malachi
[1:40:09] and Lydia, can you go fill the tubs
[1:40:11] there with the hot water? And not too
[1:40:12] hot, but I just thought I would ask
[1:40:14] them. I said, "Lord, send me somebody to
[1:40:15] fill the tubs." And then Wendy walked
[1:40:17] right in right there. I said, "Thank
[1:40:18] you, Lord. He's so faithful,
[1:40:21] so mindful.
[1:40:24] How many love the Lord tonight? Amen.
[1:40:26] How many want to be a good and faithful
[1:40:27] servant?
[1:40:29] Let me pray for you, church. You pray.
[1:40:30] Pray for me.
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:40] What a what a thought here tonight.
[1:40:43] Rewards for the faithful. The faithful
[1:40:45] servants.
[1:40:50] Heavenly Father, we're gathered here
[1:40:53] tonight. Lord, we're examining our
[1:40:54] lives.
[1:40:57] Lord, we can all agree that Brother
[1:40:58] Brandham had a huge portion of heaven,
[1:41:02] the campaigns and the visions and the
[1:41:05] seven seals and the teaching and the
[1:41:06] truth and the revelations
[1:41:09] still going around the world today. We
[1:41:11] could all agree
[1:41:14] he's a five- talent minister.
[1:41:19] Father, you said you'd give everyone
[1:41:21] according to their ability.
[1:41:23] He had the ability to do that because
[1:41:25] you gave him the gift, Lord. But you've
[1:41:27] given all of us at least one gift,
[1:41:31] at least one ministry.
[1:41:34] And Lord, I pray you look upon the
[1:41:36] people's hand hearts tonight. Lord, I
[1:41:37] don't know if their hands are up, but if
[1:41:38] their hearts are up, if their hearts are
[1:41:40] open, Father, won't you help your
[1:41:43] people, Lord God, to be faithful?
[1:41:48] Faithful to their talent that you gave
[1:41:50] them.
[1:41:51] May we not fear and say, "Well, I'm I
[1:41:53] can't do this or cuz I'm scared. I can't
[1:41:55] do that because any other excuse. It
[1:41:57] don't have to be fear. It could be any
[1:41:59] excuse. Lord God, help me, Lord. Lord,
[1:42:02] help each one of us, Lord God, to look
[1:42:04] at the talent that Christ gave us, and
[1:42:07] to put it to you, dear God,
[1:42:11] as your prophet told the doctor, he was,
[1:42:14] Brother Ram said, there's a special
[1:42:15] place in heaven for doctors that
[1:42:17] faithfully served as doctors. Brother
[1:42:19] Ram said, "There's a faithful place for
[1:42:20] farmers who faithfully serve Christ as a
[1:42:22] farmer." Hallelujah. A place for
[1:42:25] faithful mothers who faithfully serve
[1:42:27] and raise their children to know the
[1:42:28] Lord. There's a place for them.
[1:42:32] Dear Jesus,
[1:42:35] Lord,
[1:42:37] may we tonight, Lord God,
[1:42:40] be more faithful servants. Dear God, as
[1:42:43] your prophet send the dream, let us do
[1:42:45] all we can do with love to labor for
[1:42:47] you. And Lord, you'll take care of the
[1:42:49] rest.
[1:42:51] Thank you for these words we've heard
[1:42:52] tonight. Thank you for the promises of
[1:42:53] the scripture. Lord, may no man take my
[1:42:56] crown in Akran. Lord God, may not let
[1:42:58] any man, the Bible said, Jesus said,
[1:43:00] "Take heed and no man take thy crown.
[1:43:02] Let me faithfully serve through the good
[1:43:04] times, the hard times. Let me faithfully
[1:43:07] serve my family and the community copy
[1:43:09] that I teach in. Let me be a faithful
[1:43:11] servant that I can have that crown
[1:43:13] because there'll be there'll be a crown
[1:43:15] given out for a faithful pastor in
[1:43:17] Akran, a faithful minister there, Lord,
[1:43:19] in CPPley. And Lord, I want that. I want
[1:43:21] to be faithful to what you've given to
[1:43:22] me.
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:25] Help me, Jesus, as we come, Lord, before
[1:43:27] these symbols, dear God, I pray you'd
[1:43:30] help us, Lord God, to see what they
[1:43:32] mean, Lord, and take renewed faith here
[1:43:34] tonight, Lord God. Bless us as we
[1:43:37] approach this in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:43:39] And everybody said, "Amen." Praise God.
[1:43:43] Let's see. Have own way as they're
[1:43:45] preparing there. And then once they get
[1:43:47] back in here, we'll call everybody up
[1:43:48] here by God's grace.
[1:43:52] Have thine own way,
[1:43:56] Lord.
[1:43:59] Have thine own way.
[1:44:06] Thou art the potter.
[1:44:13] I am the clay.
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:20] Hold me and make
[1:44:25] me
[1:44:28] after thy will.
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:34] Let them wait.
[1:44:41] Yed
[1:44:43] and still.
[1:44:46] Let's sing. Pleasing. Pleasing.
[1:44:48] pleasing.
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:54] Let me be pleasing
[1:44:59] to you.
[1:45:02] Let everything
[1:45:05] I do,
[1:45:07] Lord, be pleasing
[1:45:11] to you.
[1:45:15] Praying
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:20] that everything
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] I pursue
[1:45:27] be pleasing,
[1:45:30] oh Lord,
[1:45:32] unto you.
[1:45:38] One more time. Oh, please.
[1:45:44] Let's just worship now.
[1:45:46] Keep pleasing
[1:45:49] to you.
[1:45:52] Let everything I do,
[1:45:57] Lord, be pleasing
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:01] to you.
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:05] Pray
[1:46:10] that everything
[1:46:13] I pursue
[1:46:17] be pleasing
[1:46:20] Lord.
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:25] You know I forgot to read that scripture
[1:46:28] in Matthew 25 after the parable of
[1:46:30] talents. He said,
[1:46:33] he said, "Take the talent from him which
[1:46:35] had the one and give it unto him which
[1:46:37] hath 10 talents."
[1:46:40] Look, think about that. The man with the
[1:46:43] one talent lost his crown. And that
[1:46:45] crown or ministry was given to another
[1:46:48] man who had even more business. He was
[1:46:50] even busier. A man who wasn't as busy
[1:46:53] with his ministry, but wasn't faithful
[1:46:54] to it, God took it from him and gave it
[1:46:57] to somebody who was even busier with
[1:46:59] that money. And then they'd invest it.
[1:47:02] My he said, "For unto everyone that hath
[1:47:05] shall be given, and he shall have
[1:47:07] abundance, but from him that hath not
[1:47:09] shall be taken away even that which he
[1:47:10] hath."
[1:47:14] Church, we don't we all say these words,
[1:47:15] "Oh, I'm so busy." Anybody guilty of
[1:47:17] saying those words?
[1:47:20] But we're not too busy to do the work of
[1:47:22] the Lord.
[1:47:25] That's why I admire people when when
[1:47:26] some ministries fail, others will pick
[1:47:28] up and help along. Or if a pastor leaves
[1:47:30] a church, some other pastors will come
[1:47:32] in to help. Don't you appreciate people
[1:47:34] that do that by God's grace? They see a
[1:47:36] crown, they see something waiting there
[1:47:38] and they even though they're busy, even
[1:47:40] though they've got a full schedule, a
[1:47:41] full ministry, they are able to pour
[1:47:43] themselves in and help out. God, help us
[1:47:45] to find a way we can help out. Amen.
[1:47:47] Let's come up here for our our prayer
[1:47:49] here and our our bread and wine by God's
[1:47:52] grace. If you come up here, let's come
[1:47:53] up all to the front row. I believe we
[1:47:54] can all fit up here by the grace of the
[1:47:56] Lord.
[1:47:58] And I'm going to read a different text
[1:48:00] here tonight out of Luke.
[1:48:04] I just found this text. You know, it's a
[1:48:05] familiar text to us, but it's a little
[1:48:07] shorter version, but I like it. I like
[1:48:08] to uh read that there by God's grace.
[1:48:14] Let's sing that. We should play that
[1:48:16] little song. Heal me, O Lord, and I will
[1:48:17] be healed. You know, the Bible said that
[1:48:19] communion brings healing. How many know
[1:48:20] that it brings healing? It's a type of
[1:48:23] the Passover lamb. Hallelujah. which
[1:48:25] sustained them for 40 years in the
[1:48:27] wilderness. My
[1:48:29] brought out by the power of the lamb.
[1:48:31] Amen. Let's pray first for the symbols
[1:48:34] here. Heavenly Father,
[1:48:36] Lord, we're about to partake of this
[1:48:38] supper.
[1:48:41] Lord, the very first one, you were with
[1:48:43] the disciples and you said you longed
[1:48:45] with desire. You desired to eat with
[1:48:47] them. That was the first one. And now my
[1:48:51] thoughts go, what about to the marriage
[1:48:52] supper in heaven? If you desire this
[1:48:54] earthly one, the last one until the
[1:48:56] great supper, how much more do you
[1:48:58] desire to sit down with us, Lord God?
[1:49:01] I imagine after like brother Ram's
[1:49:03] dream, all of us enter in there up the
[1:49:05] stairs, Lord God. Those of us who serve
[1:49:07] you faithfully,
[1:49:09] maybe we'll shake hands for a little
[1:49:10] while and then
[1:49:13] there'll be some heavenly sound that
[1:49:14] says, "Please be seated." We'll shake
[1:49:17] each other's hand. We'll reach across
[1:49:19] the table. I'll shake Brother Vang's
[1:49:20] hand. It's a pleasure to serve with you
[1:49:22] in life, Brother Vang.
[1:49:24] Brother John, each one of us, brother
[1:49:27] Kevin, all the brothers, it's been a
[1:49:28] pleasure. It is a pleasure to serve the
[1:49:30] Lord with you on earth.
[1:49:34] And then he'll come out. There'll be a
[1:49:37] great announcement and the Lord Jesus
[1:49:39] will walk into the supper
[1:49:42] and he'll say with desire, I've desired
[1:49:43] to eat this with you. I haven't had
[1:49:47] communion since I left my disciples
[1:49:50] on the earth.
[1:49:52] And Lord, we're at that moment, Lord,
[1:49:53] you'll wipe away all the tears from our
[1:49:55] eyes, Lord, of all the hardships and all
[1:49:56] the trials, the spiritual persecutions
[1:49:59] we go through, Lord. The tests,
[1:50:04] the trials.
[1:50:06] [Music]
[1:50:08] That's where my thoughts are tonight,
[1:50:09] Lord God.
[1:50:13] You've already told us well done. And
[1:50:14] there we are at the supper
[1:50:19] and you come forth and feed us bread and
[1:50:21] wine.
[1:50:24] Bless these symbols, Lord God.
[1:50:27] May we think of that. In fact, your
[1:50:29] prophet said, "May we think to the end
[1:50:31] of our life, what is our life going to
[1:50:33] be at the end? What are we preparing to
[1:50:36] be our testimony at the end of our life
[1:50:38] right now?
[1:50:41] Lord, I'm preparing right now by
[1:50:44] preaching the word, obeying the word,
[1:50:46] loving the word, worshiping you. At the
[1:50:49] end of life, I'll be a faithful servant,
[1:50:50] Lord God,
[1:50:54] that my investments will bring forth
[1:50:57] double.
[1:51:00] Grant it, Jesus, for each and every
[1:51:01] person. Grant that, Lord, that they'll
[1:51:03] get double what they invest in the
[1:51:05] kingdom of God.
[1:51:10] in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:51:13] You are the one
[1:51:17] I praise. Let's sing that. Heal me, oh
[1:51:20] Lord.
[1:51:22] Heal me, oh Lord,
[1:51:26] and I will be healed.
[1:51:31] Save me and I will be saved.
[1:51:40] Heal me, oh Lord.
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:55] Thank you Lord.
[1:52:02] [Music]
[1:52:06] How many need a little healing touch
[1:52:07] tonight? Does anybody need a healing
[1:52:08] touch? Praise the Lord. Then we can have
[1:52:11] full confidence. Let our profession be
[1:52:13] this communion will bring healing to my
[1:52:16] situation. Whether it's spiritual,
[1:52:19] financial, physical, this will bring
[1:52:21] healing. Hallelujah.
[1:52:23] Amen. Luke 22:19. And he took the bread
[1:52:26] and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave
[1:52:28] unto them, saying, "This is my body
[1:52:29] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:52:31] remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup
[1:52:34] after supper. This cup is the new
[1:52:35] testament in my blood which is shed for
[1:52:38] you." Let's sing that one more time, and
[1:52:40] I'll pass out the symbols. Just please
[1:52:41] hold the bread until we've all been
[1:52:43] served. Praise God.
[1:52:45] Heal me, O Lord,
[1:52:49] and I will be healed.
[1:52:54] Stay.
[1:52:57] I will be saved.
[1:53:03] Heal me, oh Lord,
[1:53:07] and I will be.
[1:53:12] You are the one
[1:53:16] I praise.
[1:53:22] You are
[1:53:25] my
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:31] heal me, oh Lord,
[1:53:35] that I
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:40] save me and I will be
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:57] You are the one
[1:54:01] I praise.
[1:54:06] You are the one
[1:54:10] I praise.
[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:14] There was just enough pieces. I ripped
[1:54:15] it perfectly and I just thought that's
[1:54:17] perfect. He has a perfect portion for
[1:54:19] each one of us. His word. And he took
[1:54:23] the bread and gave thanks and break it
[1:54:24] and gave unto them saying, "This is my
[1:54:26] body which is given for you. This do in
[1:54:28] remembrance of me. Let us partake
[1:54:29] together.

[1:55:26] supper, saying, "This cup is a new
[1:55:28] testament in my blood which is shed for
[1:55:30] you. This do in remembrance of me." I'll
[1:55:34] bring this around. Let's partake
[1:55:35] together here.
[1:55:37] He's
[1:55:42] gone.
[1:55:44] Just
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:56:08] portion
[1:56:11] of my transgressions.
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:25] He was bruised for my

[1:56:36] Surely
[1:56:40] our sorrows
[1:56:45] and
[1:56:48] Christ
[1:56:52] were healing.
[1:56:54] fight for he
[1:56:57] was paid
[1:56:59] as those true stripes were made
[1:57:05] by the trust.

[1:57:30] He was

[1:57:36] for our
[1:57:38] transgressions.
[1:57:43] He was bruised
[1:57:45] our ending.
[1:57:47] [Music]
[1:58:00] Jesus
[1:58:02] by
[1:58:04] his stripes we are healed.
[1:58:10] He has healed my sick soul. He has
[1:58:12] healed my sick soul.
[1:58:17] and every will
[1:58:21] and he'll do
[1:58:24] the same
[1:58:26] for you. He's the same yesterday.
[1:58:31] He's the same as yesterday
[1:58:35] and today and for

[1:59:06] Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:09] Surely
[1:59:11] he bore
[1:59:13] our sorrows.
[1:59:18] And by
[1:59:20] his stripes,

[1:59:24] crucified.
[1:59:27] On the cross, crucif
[1:59:30] In great sorrow, he died. In great
[1:59:32] sorrow,
[1:59:34] the giver of life was he. The giver
[1:59:39] of life
[1:59:41] was he. Yet my Lord was despised and
[1:59:44] rejected. Yet my Lord was despised
[1:59:50] and rejected.
[1:59:53] This Jesus of Calvary. This Jesus
[1:59:58] of Calvary. Calary.
[2:00:02] Hallelujah.
[2:00:04] He was wounded
[2:00:07] for all
[2:00:09] transgressions.
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:14] He was brought
[2:00:17] [Music]
[2:00:28] sorrow.
[2:00:29] [Music]
[2:00:39] Heavenly Father, one more prayer Lord
[2:00:41] before we wash our feet. Lord of one
[2:00:43] another.
[2:00:45] Dear God, let us
[2:00:49] remember our place of service. Let us
[2:00:53] see the talent you've given to us. Let
[2:00:56] us see our post of duty. And let us hold
[2:00:59] fast on that crown. And let no man take
[2:01:02] our crown.
[2:01:05] You've called each and every one of us
[2:01:06] to do something here. Lord, it's so
[2:01:09] wonderful, Lord, to see what God has
[2:01:11] calls each person to do. I think of how
[2:01:13] wonderful to be as you show me and show
[2:01:15] us all what my children or different
[2:01:17] children as they grow. It's so amazing
[2:01:19] to see what you've called them to do.
[2:01:23] I think back when I was a child and
[2:01:26] I never would have known I'd be a
[2:01:28] pastor, a preacher, and Cam and Simon
[2:01:30] and different ones. Lord, to see the
[2:01:32] crown that we can we can gain, we can
[2:01:35] lay a hold of it if we'll just be
[2:01:37] faithful.
[2:01:39] Lord, show each one every one of us our
[2:01:41] crown,
[2:01:44] our purpose on this earth, dear God,
[2:01:46] that we can run with perseverance the
[2:01:49] race that is set before us, laying aside
[2:01:52] every sin that doth easily beset us,
[2:01:54] Lord God.
[2:01:58] That one day you'll say, "Well done,
[2:01:59] brother so and so, sister so and so.
[2:02:02] Enter into the joys of the Lord prepared
[2:02:05] for you from the foundation of the
[2:02:07] world. Amen. Help us to be humble now as
[2:02:10] we wash one another's feet. Let's not
[2:02:12] let this become common. Lord, let it be
[2:02:14] sincere that if I'm washing a brother's
[2:02:17] feet, I want to serve him. I want to
[2:02:18] help him. Anytime he asks me if I can do
[2:02:21] it, I help him.
[2:02:23] Our sisters, as they wash feet, if I can
[2:02:25] help this sister, God, help me to be
[2:02:27] able to serve her. How can I serve that
[2:02:29] my sister? I pray that Lord, show us
[2:02:32] sisters how they can serve each other.
[2:02:34] Show the brothers how they can serve
[2:02:36] each other.
[2:02:38] that we can be servants to one another
[2:02:43] as we faithfully serve you Lord God
[2:02:47] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[2:02:50] bless you church. We have the sisters in
[2:02:51] here and what make sure we turn up the
[2:02:53] live stream. Mel, did you turn it off
[2:02:54] already? Thank you, sir. Appreciate
[2:02:56] that.
