[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I'm sorry about that thank you sir praise God it's gonna be the house of Lord today praise God let's remember a couple announcements here first one is yesterday I did a podcast with a brother from Idaho it's about an hour and a half and it's on face on YouTube if you like to listen to it he's the brother that's trying to get us to debate the believe the sign and so if you like that I can share that link that was a nice update there just wanted not update you on that also a real good testimony a couple years ago we prayed for a girl who's in my class who was battling cancer and her name was Kylie she went back to the doctor on Wednesday for another six months checkup and she was clear no cancer by God for that one member we I think it was in that when we were in that sanctuary we prayed and fasted for that one we had prayer at our school for that one and so God is so faithful I'm just so encouraged by that you know she gives a lot of her time that little fifth-grade girl she gives a lot of her time and her ministry is going into the hospitals and giving sick kids you know bags of markers and you know just stuffed animals like that she's she does that too like two hundred at a time and that's her and she's the one who's seen angel she saw an angel and she said I know mr. Smith is close to God she knows that too and so you know God has done great things there and so we're just thankful I just thought that encourage you you know she went back to the doctor and they couldn't find any cancer so thank the Lord for that so just a nice little noun sment another announcement just remember we're trying to stay with 10 here so banging his daughter Lily might come that would make 10 I told by the Amen like if there's a couple people that want to come extra we could have located for me to have 10 or 11 or 12 verse 13 or whatever the main thing to do is keep the six to six feet of distance away because the government can't stop anyone from gathering they can give guidelines and things like that but they can't break you know the First Amendment rights to free speech and gathering they can't they can't outlaw that but I do want to try to respect you know the laws as much as possible but just so you know if we do have a couple over that doesn't bother me or but we should you know try to use wisdom because there at the there's a Lima church that now has some of the Saints in Lima that believe the message some of them have coronavirus there's a couple that got it so they're quarantine and everything like that so it's just a reminder that it doesn't matter what church should go to you know this is just a virus this is just a sorrow and just like the flu except a little worse and we got to overcome that by God's grace so just keep that in mind let's use God's wisdom and we'll try our best to abide by you know the wishes of the government but you know God's Word is first in everything and I just saw to the number Americans that have lost their lives was about eighty eight hundred it's about eight thousand eight hundred so far in America but remember that's awful but that's that's nothing compared to abortion that's nothing compared to drug overdose so while that's awful Crona virus is so sad it's so devastating it is but there's more evils going on that people can overcome and we just got to pray that people can overcome those as well I'm gonna pray for everyone right Bob says pray for all men and all women so we we do that so let's remember sister Karen Rolfe she woke up and she was planning on coming with Sarah today but she woke up sick and coughing so I'm glad she stayed home Lord bless you sister will pray for your recovery but it's always wise if you're sick at all just stay at home it just wise to do that so god bless her let's remember brother amen had an unspoken request so we'll remember that brother and as a little boy from the town I grew up in his name's Kaden and he's battling cancer let's pray for him by God's grace God can heal through miracle or medicine however God chooses to heal he's the only healer and let's pray God get all the glory any other requests praise God let's pray for those in tithes and offerings I mean it has those by God's grace and that's the Lord to minister to day here have any father Lord we love you today we thank you great is your faithfulness great is your love to us or not we want to take Lourdes warning by your Holy Spirit and eternal perspective on these things we're in the midst of something in our life that we've never seen Lord and with your perspective we can see it's sorrow it's people ready for your coming shaking this country it is so we thank you or Tom said you'd shake everything but there's one kingdom that can't be shaded that's the key so we thank you know that we are a part by birth I spiritual Earth and my spiritual blood blood of Christ were part of the family of God part of a kingdom that can never be shaken so with that confidence we come rapidly in your name Lord asking you to minister today forgive our sins Lord God the cleanse us from unrighteous this morning we pray as priests unto God we pray for these requests in Jesus they bring healing the sister Carol in Christ's name Lord I let her be made well for your glory we pray for the saints that have the coronavirus and Lima in Jesus maybe they believe your promises may you bring them the medicines and Lord bring healing in their body by the touch of the Holy Spirit and Lord this boy named Caden in Christ naming overcome cancer just like Kylene order you can do it again but we ask for your will to be done give he and his family strength dear God may he sense your presence as Kylie did she sets the angels in her hospital room nor may he sense your presence Lord for your glory and father me with the unspoken needs agents hates Lord a minister I pray in Jesus Christ to those made smart for each and every one of us for my hands raised I have needs morning hour to see my family say what I want to see the great things for God and here amongst us Lord

[Music] wonderful songs there praise God he's the Lord of hosts that means he's the Lord of armies praise God Angel armies thank the Lord and he said the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear the Lord so we're grateful we have an army around us and so many times God protects us all throughout the day every day 24 hours seven days a week there's times he allows us to be tested but even in the test he said I'll never leave you no forsake you so we thank the Lord for His amazing grace as you're turning there Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 just ruined I want to renounce this - I forgot to say this brother Amen reminded me about this coming week as Easter I just forgot about it you know next Sunday so we'll have a Friday night service if you can't attend that I'll have another Saturday night service so I'll send out a text cuz I want everybody to have communion I want Beatrice Lord willing if she like to come we'll divide up you know half the church can come on Friday half on Saturday so everybody can have communion with the Lord and with each other so I forgot I wanted to announce that let's do that Friday and Saturday I'm on spring break this week so I have no work it's not free time brother so I can study up and be prepared and let's have a Friday night service for Good Friday and then I'll preach again Saturday whatever time you know you're available so by God's grace and then we'll have one Sunday Easter service at our regular time as long as the law and everything as long as the government says that's okay so fees in Chapter six and I'll text everybody about that just to remind you because I kind of forgot about announcing that - he's in chapter 6 verse 10 like to finish Lord willing maybe we'll finish the book of Ephesians and then I think I want to go Galatians Ephesians I want to go right into Colossians kalash is very similar to Ephesians it seems as if Paul wrote it right around the same time and he echoed he may have wrote both at the same time and put a lot of the same thoughts into both books but there are some special things he said of course in Colossians that we need to emphasize I'm sorry Philippians is after Ephesians but Ephesians 6:10 so Lord willing we'll go to Philippians next if God is willing and that's all inspired by brother Branham said the millions shouted out were resting on Paul's gospel and so if there's a gospel we need to know it's Paul's gospel praise God you're resting on that he said to take one word away or the change it was to take a curse upon you so we must really know Paul's gospel right from the scripture praise God so Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 and then we'll do our memory verses so you know we sent me some verses there so we'll do our that reverses right out of a Philippians 4 so let's just read verse 10 together and then we'll go to Philippians four seven and eight so it's read Ephesians 6:10 let's begin on three one two three finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might let's go to Philippians four seven and eight just a couple books their visions four seven and eight this be our memory verses we read it that just asked the Lord to write it upon our hearts praise God verses seven eight let's read seven eight together one two three and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things what beautiful promises let's have a word of Prayer if you have anything on your heart let's just make to God here Lord you see the hands that are raised you see the hearts that are raised father we love you and we realize this is the time to be gathered together to receive from you we've given our sacrifice of praise Lord and we offer that freely to you from sincere hearts and we've worshiped you we've watered Lord to seed in our heart Lord and now we just pray Lord that your spirit will come and quicken the seed and cause it to grow in our lives dear God and minister to the needs that we have Lord God I'm just a man I can do nothing Lord God but you Lord come through the the channel of yielded vessels Lord God so coming your great power of your word and Lord speak to us today meet every need upon your people's hearts they're your sheep you're the great Shepherd I'm a sheep Lord guide us great Bishop of our souls lead us to green pastures Lord lead us to still waters Lord God restore our souls in the midst of this virus Lord and this this distress upon the nations Lord and guide us Lord has the great faithful Shepherd Lord God you are our Shepherd Lord and we we shall not want we shall not lack of any good thing in this hour and we give you the praise in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless she's been seated praise God praise the Lord so we like to look at this thought again Lydia I do have quotes up there you can have a few quotes and things to reference you know I appreciate you know Easter and Palm you know days Palm Sunday a lot of churches today they can't gather but you know they would they would just bring palms and wave palms and there's nothing wrong with that I think that's a fine thing but I think it's I think it's a sign that a lot of churches are not right when the only palms they can raise our natural palms we should be able to raise our palms our hands in the turn true worship of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm glad and you know Church I'm not being critical but they call this Holy Week every week is Holy Week to us and the way you know is you look at you know look at Mardi Gras when they I'm a lot of friends I have a lot of friends on Facebook you know and a lot of them are dime and I'm not criticizing them but Mardi Gras they'll drink beer they'll though indulge in all the the fleshly less and then come you know the ashes of the next what is it Monday 3rd or Monday Thursday I can't remember Ash Wednesday they call it they'll put ashes on their head like to kind of represent now they're gonna be real sincere we need to be sincere every week praise God hallelujah every Wednesday's Ash Wednesday in other words we're not natural ashes but we repent in in spiritual ashes right we repent we humble ourselves we humble ourselves every Wednesday every Sunday and so I just want to just reiterate that again like brother Branham he majored on that I'm sure I didn't major but he made a major statement on that and he said how the church does Lent where they give up something in brother brand again he says it every well he says that all the time on the tape he says we do an everlasting lent every season is lent season to us in other words we're constantly giving up something you know they give up chocolate or they give up Facebook or or they give up YouTube or or they give up cussing you know but a Christian is always Underland they're always sacrificing and giving up something for God's glory praise God amen and so we we have to do that we have to constantly give up things for the kingdom of God and we're happy to do it praise God so this is part 24 just a few things to show by God's grace I want to get my notes together here and we're looking at I want to just look at the full armor of God here because I preached it a couple years ago but as I wrote the chapter about the rapture it became clear to me and it was a fresh revelation to me that when Paul is dealing with the rapture he tells us the only way to be ready is to be fully armored as a Christian soldier so I want to just reiterate that and back to Ephesians sit I'm sorry 1st Thessalonians 5 I want to go back to that by God's grace and look at that just for a moment you know the chapter 4 is the rapture chapter first Thessalonians 4 and then chapter 5 as we looked at on Wednesday is the season of the rapture he says we'll know the times and seasons and will know it because we are not drunken and we are not sleeping and I believe - I believe this is scriptural the foolish virgin isn't sleeping either because remember she heard the shout she in the parable the ten virgins the foolish virgin woke up and she hears the shout in other words she hears the message of the hour and she's getting she's trying to get ready but she realizes she's not born again and I heard brother Donny Reagan said I was a sin to his sermon last week and he says he's heard reports about churches around the world or even through even through their live services are getting lots of extra clicks and people are contacting the pastor saying we're getting saved we're getting saved and that's good many people will get saved during this time listen every time there's a shaking number 911 911 cause Simon to go to Craig's Bible study so he could hear the message praise God glory so every time there's this natural worldwide or national disaster it's always done to shake up people so they'll get their check they'll check their lives with God's Word praise God and then in doing that when they get shaken up if they're drawn to Christ if they really love God and they really sell out they'll go deeper in the things of God but what we know today a lot of people will get saved at this time nor the coronavirus which they will but they've got to go all the way and they've got to get the oil available that the oil is available right now praise God anybody can be borned again they just got to obey the Word of God amen they got to keep hungry and thirsting for more righteousness and Jesus will fill them with the Holy Ghost it's very simple he said he said if you hunger and thirst for righteousness you shall be filled praise God and so it's available to anyone who's hungry and thirsty for it praise God but there'll be many people that just become a foolish virgins at this time and they'll live true to God they'll say oh my this has never happened we've never had runs at the grocery store we've never been lacking chicken before or toilet paper like our grocery store here that's what it lacks it they got everything except no toilet paper and chicken they got it some weeks they don't have it next weeks you know last week they had it this week they don't have it so there's all these runs on it I think people fear the Lord and and get closer to God which is a good thing but if we're really hungry we'll want to see Jesus Christ in every part of our life praise God and that's where the wise virgins she's more wise she takes more time to prepare extra oil he's God that's the difference between the wise and the foolish the wise prepared she oh my god this might be a long journey praise God I need more oil I need all the oil I can get praise God amen and I want to go out to meet the bridegroom praise God I want to be ready then he moment to go meet the bridegroom so it's all about preparedness and wisdom the wise version prepares and wisdom for the foolish she recognizes she's not sleeping but the world is sleeping there in a drunken stupor they don't even know what's going on but thank God we know what's going on praise God and that's that's what I'm saying thank the Lord that we know the Word of God amen thank God it's a thing to rejoice in now 1st Thessalonians 5 here I want to get back to this because it speaks of the armor of God now look at verse 7 let's go to 1st Thessalonians 5 7 for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day now isn't it striking there's darkness and light at the same time right so a person who's not confessed their sins and not saved they are they're living in a dark spiritual state so right now currently it is a spiritual dark time for sinners but it's a spiritual light time for us praise God amen there's actually two spiritual conditions you're either living under you're either living under darkness spiritual drunkenness you know drunken with the things of the world or you're living under spiritual light and Paul says we are of the day and so he says we are sober which means of course not drunk we're in our right mind we're alert we're putting on the breastplate of faith and love and foreign helmet the hope of salvation I love that he's saying we're putting it on right now amen praise God in his day but they meant in his day they were putting it on he's God see that's what our lives are a lot our lives are just filled with putting the armor on all the time praise God making sure we got everything ready to go our lives are we are in the process of putting it on and keeping ourselves armored because it's a war praise God we are in the midst of the law praise the Lord remember of even's for Ephesians 5 you know we just moved from chapter 5 to 6 in Ephesians 5 he said submit yourselves one to another he says wives submit to your husband's husbands love your wives children submit to your parents slaves submit to your masters and then he breaks into how you're a soldier amen so it's so a husband is armored to be armored with armor of God a wife is to be armored with the armor of God the children are to be armored with the armor of God praise God slaves slaves to the economic system of America are to be armored with the armor of God amen this is what he's building upon he says and if you're armored then you're gonna act the way Christ would act praise God and you'll act in love you're acting submission you'll humble yourself yes you you can humble yourself as a soldier every police officer I know humbles themselves how many times have I I say it like this but man couple times I've locked my keys into my car and I've had cops come and help me out I've gotten three accidents and every time it was my fault I've hit three people when the first time was the worst time where the girl just got out screaming and cried after that I just barely bump people like a little scratch and every time that officer humbles himself he submits himself to my problem right he's got all the armor on sister Deo he's got a gun he's got mace he's got a he humbly but yet he's fully armored and he comes to Humble himself to this little person who makes their mistake oh praise God that's to be us we're to be fully armored but yet submit and help out other people when they accidentally make a mistake right like I accidentally locked my keys now it's been a number of years thank God for that we you know we do silly things that we make foolish mistakes or say like that but those who are armored are cut we seen all the time you know a firefighters they're armed right with axes and they got everything that they're armed but they humble themselves and they serve other people that's really what Paul's saying a Christian is fully armored but yet we were able to humble ourselves to those who make mistakes and help them out and serve them we're to be public servants as well praise God amen and the later newer too is in our homes that's where Paul he ends this beautiful letter by saying if you are a servant he said serve those that are closest to you in your home because if you can't live it in your home you're not gonna live it anywhere else praise God hallelujah so I think it's so beautiful he ends it by saying look at your home live look at your job like he talks to slaves right in their masters look at those your closest around love them serve them and have on the armor of God because what is Satan gonna try new he's gonna try to divide the homes right he's gonna try to put he's trying to inject little lies and and and pride in and lusts and arrogance and all these things he's gonna try to inject that amongst us but we must stand up for each other and serve one another praise God amen in the midst of Satan's of the darts that he's firing at us we must put up the shield of faith so let me just say like this yesterday on that interview at an interview you know on the podcast there's a couple chances I could have really spoke evil about the believe the sign people or the jeffersonville people there was opportunities where Satan could have tempt me to do that but what I try to do brother bang is put up the shield of faith praise God and and instead of attacking them just in a lovely way in a loving way say I disagree but I'm sure they're real sincere people I'm sure they're there are nice people right there kind people so when we knew that church we're standing up and we're putting our shield to protect those that we disagree with praise God and that's what we should do if someone's trying to attack you or just protect them praise God like brother Anderson make make the circle bigger praise God I got to stand up for brother Tim Humes who's he's under a lot attack right now but I called him a good godly man and a wonderful pastor you know the enemy could have tried me to get me to say evil against people and this like they could say evil against me but we should use the shield of faith to protect others praise God the police officers are trying to protect us right and so with more powerful weapons than that because we've got God's Word amen because remember Jesus said you've got keys aim don't worry you've got keys than the kingdom of God amen and just remember Jesus prayed for them on the cross in the moment he could have cursed him he said Father forgive them they know not what they do hey man here's the keys Jesus said whatever you bind on earth it'll be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven amen praise God we've got the keys like they caught the police officer we got this the sword of it like a real soldier and we have the ability to be merciful to other people let's be careful who we curse let's be careful trying to curse anybody praise I just try to curse the devil pray Scott I really try not to curse anybody uh I want everyone to be saved mercy by God's grace now should we warn people absolutely we should warn people but we should also extend grace at the same time remember I just read it yesterday the Apostle Paul before he was saved Saints he was going around dragging Christians of prison and Bible said he was trying to get them to blaspheme so he would he would be pulling them around saying I'm gonna put you in prison unless you say Jesus was of Beelzebub he was doing the most evil things you could think of and we wouldn't want to give up on him right and member Jesus said he said when he knocked him down he said why are you kicking against the pricks what does that mean that means ox and ox they had goats here like which were little spikes and and and and if you're hurting yourself so the whole time Paul was dragging them to prison it was stealing his joy it was stealing his happiness it was stealing any piece he had he was hurting himself but Jesus came Jesus came to set him free praise God amen a church when we hurt others when we when we say evil things about others were just really hurting ourselves amen we're hurting ourselves that we can't do that and Paul was trying to say just blasting just say he's of Beelzebub and they're like no we can't do that he's real to us how do you know because he's in my heart praise God hey man how do you know Jesus as we are I didn't see him die I don't know but his spirits in my life amen praise God and I felt forgiven I felt the power of God I felt his love and I have a love inside of me I can't explain I just know it's a divine holy love praise God amen and so people mind a curse Paul but look what he turned into the greatest missionary there ever was now by you know bragging on Paul but bragging on the Holy Ghost in Paul praise so putting it on verse 8 unless two pieces of the armor the breastplate and the helmet the hope of salvation verse 9 I love it for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ hey man so Paul's picture is we are we are spiritual soldiers and we can see everything but sinners are drunken they're sleeping they're not fighting for God at all they're not doing anything for God but we should be awake and ready and we know the lights the sun's up the lights are on and darts are gonna fly too at us from everywhere darts are going to be shooting at and Paul says be armored with the armor of God because you know there's going to be attacks and you'll be ready and you're able to overcome praise God your you are armored with it praise God you're not you're not defenseless you have defenses praise God we have five defenses and I want to look at those here the whole armour of God now I showed this a slide last week I believe we have five defensive pieces and one offensive let me get to my notes here yeah here we go so our only hope church is to put on the full armor of God and we have six pieces like a six is the number of man praise God six pieces you have five defensive grace and one offensive praise God hallelujah and they're all put on my prayer because the Bible says that in Ephesians 6:18 now let's go over these a little bit by God's grace we put these on that we may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand praise God in other words we're not a laying down police officer we're not a sleeping soldier we are an active soldier praise God we are there we're not just sitting on the sidelines we are in service praise God we're not resting we're not on vacation we're working for God amen he said stand and all that you do he said stand praise God now let me go back I just want to show the pictures here we looked at this last week if you didn't see the picture it's a really good picture Paul after all the the love your family he says but you're a soldier and he got that from Jesus Christ Isaiah wrote about Jesus Christ and how he had the helmet of salvation and the breastplate of righteousness speaking of the Messiah so our picture though our picture of a soldier is actually taken from Isaiah's writing about Christ Christ was fully armored because he lived by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God praise God and that was our picture we read that last Sunday now I want to just show our pictures again here I preached this a couple years ago but let's get right to it here just I want to show these again I'm just gonna go quickly through these now uh let me go around the wrong page here okay I must have skipped something here bear with me here looking for oh yeah there - sorry orders I'm out of order here pardon me boys of truth now girded loins met a man or woman could tuck in their long flowing robe into their belt enabling them to travel run or work so in the same way a Christians mind is gird up or tucked into the Bible truth see sometimes jerks are it happened to me this week I slept in I forgot to set my alarm and I instantly went to youtube and I started watching the coronavirus update and I did the wrong thing I got my mind in the news first instead of my mind into God's Word and I could tell from that moment like oh Lord I got to get back I got to get my back in my routine because you got a you got a he said gird up the loins of your mind is the first thing and that's why people struggle many times the first thing they start feeding their mind upon is trouble right it's a trouble or or a bad news or something like that but just like you tuck in that lone robe so you got to tuck your mind into the truth and that means you're calmly prepared because he said be sober right sober is calmness when your minds in the Word of God you're calm because you know God's promises can never fail you're not disturbed you're all calm about it because I know I know God God's will will be done praise God and no matter what no matter whatever God allows in my life just like job I can say the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord and job said no he slay me yet I'll trust him amen see because you're so calm your mind is so set on God's Word so when your mind is tucked into the truth you're prepared to be victorious in spiritual mind battles and successful in your ministry's work so you're free now you're ready to work because your mind is ready oh I know I got a battle today right so that's how your mind is the belt of truth now brother Adam says it like this he says I try to put a quote up there for every one of them yeah the belt holds the rest of it together how many could say men your mind holds the rest of your life together the belt holds everything together you know that you don't got that on you can't move you can't new you get work you can't run can't run the race with patience right you first got to have the mindset in order praise God now there's a whole lot I'm not gonna stay too long on this okay just because it's a whole nother sermon let me go to the next part yeah so the first thing God Jesus says through pause get your mind right every morning tuck it into the truth get it tucked in it's secure I'm calm I'm ready to labor I'm ready to fight now because my mind is tucked into the truth praise God now he says the next he said put on the breastplate of righteousness here's where I got a little out of order here so pardon me not sure why I did that with the order what's really coming together I finished the chapter yesterday so I'm 57% done I finished the chapter on Israel's blindness I've I just feel so good after these things I'm like huh I'm getting there by God's grace I'm getting there cuz I mean everybody deserves a chance to know the finished mystery of God I'm doing that that's why I'm doing it because I believe that and I believe I have a partner playing it I'm already sending my modesty book all around the world I'm emailing it to people it goes all around Australia and New Zealand wanted to be a place where I sent all my books and then they would distribute it but I said I can't afford that I don't know how to do that I don't know how to mail things overseas but I've had people tell me that like we want to be a hub and you can send us your books and distributor I said well I said I said just order them for Amazon I don't know I don't have time to do all that you imagine sending 200 bucks over to New Zealand I can't do that right now I don't know how to do that but but see all of us have a part and and all of us can do a part praise God and why as you pay your tithes and offerings you're doing your part to spread this message amen hallelujah that's exactly right if you can't go send somebody praise God and we're sending right now we said Craig and Simon and Jason de maras we've given them money to brother Ben arrived the last time he went we gave him a little offering there to go on his trip to Trinidad and so we just do our little part by God's grace now the breastplate he said put on the breastplate of faith and righteousness now a physical breastplate what does it protect your heart and your most important organs right because you can live without a leg you can live without an arm and ear but you cannot live without a heart to praise God so Paul said put on a breastplate to protect your vital organs from your chest down to your waist and so what does that mean just as you protect your most vital organs you must your righteous obedient Christian life of integrity protects your heart from Satan's attack on our character so in other words when you live righteously the righteousness of Christ protects your life praise God it's a breastplate of righteousness Christ's righteousness protects my life amen why because all my sin was put on him and all his righteousness is put on me praise God amen hallelujah so what's protecting my very life the righteousness of Christ sacrifice and we've got to put that on every day I've got to remember every day brother bang that Jesus died for my sins because I can get really depressed I can get really discouraged about what Jesse Smith does because I fall short of the glory of God many times but I must put on the breastplate of Christ's righteousness and knowing that Christ's righteousness protects my life they meant hallelujah so first my mind is ready it's ready to fight it's ready to go and now my my heart my life is protected by Christ's righteousness not mine praise God where's brother man saying yeah he said when he's the breastplate of righteousness right do what's right so righteousness is doing what's right he said I got the Word of God in you doing what's right thanks God to see Christ's righteousness is upon you you can do the right thing because his anointings upon you praise God and to protect Satan from attacking your life oh you don't live you don't live high enough or you don't live close enough to God don't ever say you're not a good Christian don't ever say you're weak in faith because boban said that's he said power of life and death is in the tongue praise God don't ever admit little things like that things that will that you criticize don't criticize yourself because what you're doing Church is you're taking off your armor we should say I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God my mind is is is ready to fight praise God Christ's righteousness protects my life amen see you and I our righteousness will always fail because we have none praise God how do you but its Christ's righteousness is what it protects us and we must remember and confess that that it's his righteousness which defends my life amen see Saint likes to try to shoot a little dart in between and get to our heart but Jesus Christ's righteousness protects us praise God if I said the devil says oh you're not righteous well that's true I'm not it's it's not my armor I'm putting on it's Christ he's God amen it's Jesus Christ armor that I'm putting on his righteousness if I was righteous I wouldn't need his righteousness but I need his righteousness because I know I'm not that's why I put on his righteousness every morning praise God maybe on Friday night I like to a part of The Passion of Christ where we can see Jesus you know that just always we see him you know flogged and beaten and it might be too you know for the children it might be little too intense even for some of our other ones but maybe I'd like to do that sometime and just see him crucified because it gives us such a picture if he had to go through all that and he did he did it willingly he didn't have to but he willingly went through it then we should have a great assurance that his sacrifice was accepted to God that all of our sin was placed upon him that means all of his righteousness is upon us amen praise God it's just a reminder that every time he was whipped every time he was stuck with the spear every time he was mocked or slapped it was our punishment being poured out on him praise God he took them the brunt of all of our sin he paid the price so we don't have to pay it praise God Berryman so he says put on the breastplate of righteousness right be righteous just like Jesus Christ the helmet of salvation a physical helmet protects the head which is the command center right and it's the most complex organ in the human body is the brain right so just like it protects the most complex organ or your command center so does the hope of salvation which is the assurance that were saved and forgiven by Jesus sacrifice that protects us from Satan's attempts to make us doubt our salvation praise God amen he gives us the hope of salvation to protect the Millar command center praise God see cuz if you start saying oh I don't even know if I'm saved you'll start the command center will start allowing you to do certain things you shouldn't do right the command center is where the mind it sends the signals right lift your arm then the brain sends out first and and if we're not protecting our command center we'll send the wrong commands praise God we must remember I'm I didn't say myself but I know I'm saved and I have assurance because it's the hope of salvation praise God Jesus gives us the defense of the helmet of salvation to protect us from something hitting our command center and making us do the wrong commands for his God amen thank the Lord the hope of salvation praise God it protects our command center so that the commands are the right ones that are listed out praise God but a man says see the mind in the air the head covers the head so all the commands from our natural mind right so now we can command ourselves to move and to do actions right and to obey the Holy Spirit all our commands are protected by the hope of salvation praise God in other words no matter what I choose I know I'm saved even if I make the wrong choice God will correct me and he'll bring me back to the perfect will of God I know I'm not lost praise God amen I know I'm protected no matter what I decide I know I'm protected by his salvation praise God I know I'm not lost praise the Lord that's what I was just I listened to a sermon to my prayer closet there's more that's what I was listen to I thank God I'm safe it's called no shame on me there's a great song out called no shame on me and says thank God I'm saying by the blood of the Lamb I know I'm saying why cuz I got on the helmet of salvation praise God amen it's protecting my mind amen and then through that the protection I'm able to send out the right commands live this way talk this way act this way worship this way live this way praise God because I'm saved amen thank the Lord he knows oh brother Ram even applies it to your healing I've got the the helmet on he said the helmet of salvation I know this my healing comes from God hey my salvation comes from God my experience matches his word not the church's idea the word so any thought of command can I be healed well I'm protected the word I'm saying I can be healed any command is protected by God's hope of salvation praise God hey man feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace soldiers feet are lower legs were protected by sandals or they're called Greaves and these protections protected soldiers when they traveled or when they were in war in the same way just like their travels were protected the Christians daily travels and decisions are protected after prayerful preparation praise God's Amen see because it's the gospel of preparation of peace so when I'm preparing to take a March I got to put on my feet protection because I know I'm going to do it that represents prayer right I'm gonna put on all this protection in other words I'm not gonna walk a step until I got on God's armor praise God I'm not gonna walk into this relationship until I prayed about it today amen I'm not gonna walk in this job until I prayed about it praise God I'm not gonna walk in this church until I prayed about it praise God all your steps all your travels in your life are made by putting on the defenses God gave us praise God amen in other words we know God directs all of our steps the footsteps of the righteous are our order of the Lord praise God and how do we put it on with prayer preparation praise the Lord Amen thank the Lord superb Ramson seat he says it's go anywhere any place any time you can go anywhere that the voice of God is leading you to go because your feet are shod with the gospel of the preparation of peace you you you and I can hear the Holy Spirit not just to call that person or reach out to that one or help out that one we can go any time or any place because we feel the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God getting our timing right a lot of times you and I will probably see it and text our emails but I got to email a couple weeks ago that said my that was right on time I just I forget what it was I think I shared the testimony I was with uh I was with my brother or something like that yeah yeah yeah when his when his son were in the hospital I hadn't contacted him for weeks all of a sudden brother bang I just felt lead I need to reach out and talk to my brother he said when I when I did he was in the ICU his son was choking on a seed what was that pistachio seed and he was it was it was just slowly draining and going down so he hadn't he didn't tell anybody he said he said burners right on time and I prayed for him over the phone and I prayed for his son the next morning the doctors when they took out this pistachio seed and he said it was right on time he needed a prayer he needed faith you need to you need to be up you need his faith to be risen and that's what it is we had we have to pray and start our day in the Word of God right being led by the Holy Spirit and then you know church when God's putting somebody on your heart you should know if I'm if I'm living right and if I'm living pure you should know the reason God put somebody on your heart is so you can reach out and pray for them praise God reach out and talk to them reach out and text them and that was a great lesson for me a nice renewal of that if I'm walking the Holy Spirit and I've got on the full armor of God and somebody is on my heart by the Holy Spirit I should reach out to them praise God you know in the past there was a couple people from our church that I would I would check in on them every time and they would say wow that was just the right time to check on because there are certain battles they were going through and that's a great example of that where we can have our feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace there's a friend I saw on I saw a reminder come up on Facebook a few years ago there's a friend from my hometown he was out of a job and he had no food and he said he sent me a Texas had pray for me his name's Scott he said pray for me so I prayed I said God in Jesus name will you help him to get some food give him a job or something he said the next hour somebody came by his door and said are you hungry do you need food an hour after I prayed for him his name's Scott Marr he wasn't from high school we were high school buddies you know things that's a couple years ago but it's a great reminder that I just dropped everything I did I just prayed for them and plead I just what I do is I normally push back my keyboard I just lift my hands and I say God please Jesus help that person and that time our feet was prepped was prepared praise God and God sent somebody across the state to give him food that he needed praise God so see just being prepared at any time go anywhere do anything just stop what you're doing and pray right there praise God always being ready your daily travels and your daily decisions are made in prayer and then you're ready to do what God has called you to do hey man uh I just I got the joy the Lord Church that's all I laugh like that I don't laugh like that because the gospel is funny I left like that cuz I'm happy praise God that's how I show my happiness hey I know it's like to be a sinner and I'm a saint now praise God these things make me happy these things make me rejoice and the Bible said rejoice always and again I say rejoice hey how do you praise God people think I laugh because it's funny it's not funny it's not rejoicing praise God I'm trying to contain it how they know yeah thank the Lord shield this is why I said earlier you and I can protect other people through our faith I saw brother Samuel preached on the shoot of faith recently and he showed her a historical thing where the shields of the Roman soldiers were acted as tall as they were so that way they could stand behind it but also they could lean down and it would protect all of them the shields were so large that they weren't just protecting themselves they were protecting people behind them as well so there's some of their not all their shields but many of their shields were so big but remember the Bible says that God is your shield praise God amen but Paul says your shield it represents God's anointing for true or I'm sorry faith shield of faith so it's God is our faith right God is our revelation God's Word is what we know it's our revelation praise God amen glory so just as a soldier shield protects all their other pieces I look at that it protects all the other ones your revelation protects every other part right I've got a revelation that Jesus died for me that does protect your your helmet - it does protect your it does protect your belt and and your and your agrees right your breastplate that's why it's so important to have a revelation about God's Word praise God that's why it's so important have a revelation of God's prophet because then when all these other attacks come you're protected because you've got a revelation praise God you can stand behind that and it won't hurt the rest of your life praise God because you can just say I know what thus saith the LORD is so when they shoot at me for they a man with trinitarian darts I can just stand there and I got the revelation that God's one person praise God that don't affect me it doesn't it doesn't bother me or does it there's a stumble meter because I got the revelation of thus saith the LORD just as a protects all the other pieces of armor so faith in Christ protects all the rest of your armor it extinguishes and stifles every falsehood Satan shoots from the bow of his lying tongue right because the Bible does say in Jeremiah that Satan has a bow and he shoots right and then says it in Revelation 60 with the white horse rider he's got a bow but no arrows cuz he he shot his lie but the church overcame it praise God amen I do yeah the church overcame the lies thank the Lord so church any with any attack think of any attack you might have that's why brother man said you got to pray for revelation more than anything whatever you're struggling with whether it's you know money or lust or greed or fear say God give me a revelation so I don't lust after that anymore give me a revelation so I'm not scared anymore about the finances of economics of this nation give me some revelation amen hallelujah and God will give it praise the Lord open up the Bible read the Bible and God will give us a revelation that we can hide behind and they'll protect us and it wipes away all the mind battles amen say God give me a revelation of that help me to hold up the shield many times surface we already know it well you're just not quoting it right many times you hear people saying well I'm so scared I might lose my job and if we don't cast that dart down we start thinking I'm going to lose my job or I'm gonna lose my car I'm gonna lose my house or you know what I mean my kids are gonna get sick Oh your cuz you know Satan knows and starts shooting and we don't even realize that dart is shot at us and we got to remember just the that's fine if they want to believe that I'll pray for you right I'll pray for you and I'll pray for my family while we while we do it see just little lies and and and pressure right now that Satan shoots at us like the media is full of it all they do is just shoot all these darts of fear about the coronavirus that's just full of it everything's an emergency everything is this huge awful thing the world the economy's going on everybody's going down but really it's not that way they just want to get you you know scared it usually shoot you and discourage you and try to get people to commit suicide or or make decisions from the control tower he wants people to take off their helmet maybe I'm not saved and take off their Hamlet salvation take down all their defences so he can start destroying them he wants to lie kill steal and destroy but Jesus has given us life and power and revelation the Spirit of God love power and a sound mind praise God he's given us a sound belt of truth praise God we should tuck our thoughts into the Word of God the truth of God and get a revelation for this that's what happened Church when I preach that coronavirus sermon that's what it did it gave me a revelation about where that came from it's from the third and fourth seal and since I preached that but Jose I haven't had any trouble with that I was a little nervous beforehand cuz I'm like where's that in the scripture I was looking where is it and then the Holy Spirit showed to me that Sunday morning ah is from the seals praise God oh it's just a sorrow it may be one of the last sorrows but it's just a sorrow praise God and will overcome it just like the early church overcame the bubonic plague right just like the overcame Spanish flu will overcome this praise God we just must have on the full armor of God don't take it off keep God's righteousness on your heart to the revelation of what's going on the hour were living in and hide behind Christ amen hide behind your faith in Revelation in God's Word amen that's what I'm doing I'm hiding paul says amen my life is hidden christ amen i'm in behind the holy spirit my life is hid and no one can touch me because i'm in christ amen hallelujah my life is hid in christ Aransas see to show that that one that knocks off the darts my brother anymore he said it's like water off a duck's back that's what your shield of faith is when you got a revelation like when you got a revelation you know God had me marry this person God had me had these children when you got a revelation on that all the lies they just flow right off you god gave me a revelation on my home church it just rose all these attacks just roll right off you all you shouldn't pay your tithes and offering you can't afford it those just kind of roll off me because I got a revelation of it praise God I know what God says or you should criticize that person you should you should badmouth them or you should get revenge on them that just flows right off because I have a revelation praise God that's right it just knocks off all the darts praise God now the last one the sword of the Spirit a soldier sword is their main offensive and lethal weapon just like that the Word of God spoken through a Christians mouth will resist the devil the Bible says will wound the devil and the Bible says will bruise the devil amen hallelujah eventually putting that demon to flight that's what about Jesus had to resist him three times so you struck woods let him he said it's written again struck twice he said it's written also and then finally he left but he had to keep fighting with the word here's what the Bible says here's the Bible says my God is Jehovah Jireh and that's shouting but you got to confess it out of your mouth the Bible says the word is nigh thee even in your mouth praise God the trouble I see in my life I'm sure your life too is we just get a spot we stop speaking God's word then we wonder where is the power and there's power of life in the tongue I think I'm gonna preach on that this week Kings I've been really enjoying that thought lately there's power of life and death in the tongue I am a forgiving child of God I believe I'm born again and the more the longer I live sister Naomi the more I believe I'm born again because I look at so many people's lives that say they're born again and they're not living the way Christ said to live in simple things I'm not talking to eat mysteries or things yeah I'm just talking simple things right with like for example like on Facebook laughing at cussing on Facebook when they put cuz it means I have custody people laugh at that and enjoy that just simple things like that or watching TV or bring your Netflix in your house and watching dirty shows you shouldn't be watching it's just simple things the Bible said avoid all appearance of evil praise God that's the revelation of the shield I got I'm not going to let that in because I've got a revelation I understand from all of Satan's darts praise God but if you keep speaking when I keep speaking God's Word we resist wound bruised and eventually put him to flight and then we can have a vacation time Jesus enjoy Satan left him for a season praise God they'll be harder seasons than others right but everything works together for God's good he makes everything beautiful in his own time hallelujah there will be seasons when your battles are less how many ever been through those thank the Lord for those praise God and remember the great pictures that Armageddon Jesus Christ all them all that listen all the men are gathered against him and what comes out of his mouth a sword of all the things that we could see a sword comes out of his mouth and the sword goes down and burns them all up don't forget this search these rich men that think they're so great now the Bible said brother bang they're gonna go hide in the caves and say rocks fall on us they might not be afraid of Christ now but they'll be afraid of Christ later I don't care how much money they got I think there's even videos on YouTube where they make their own caves on the ground that's probably part of it anything they can hide away but the cording to God's Word they'll be crying in there to say oh I want to die I don't want to face him the church what a blessing we have we want to see his face amen we want to live and we don't want the things of the world we don't want the pleasures of this life we want the pleasures of eternity praise God we want to see is that I want to see Jesus why because I served them my life and I wasn't worshiping I want to deal with them forever praise God hallelujah but these same rich man I think they're so rich they got everything they all figured out they're gonna live forever they're not gonna live forever they're gonna mention be hiding away from Christ but I don't want to hide from him I wanna hide in him you'll do one of the other church we're doing one of the other we're gonna hide away from him we're gonna hide with him praise God I want to hide in Christ that's right and every time you quote the word you're doing that every time you obey God's Word you are hiding in the protection of God's Word same thing for my life same thing for your life we're hiding in God's power and protection now let me finish this chapter let's almost done here but man said wave it in your hand wave that sword in your hand just wave it at the devil devil you better stop right there you better leave me it's written I'm a child of God there's no condemnation to me I'm in Christ Jesus I'm not living by my righteousness I'm living by Christ's righteousness right hallelujah I've got it I got the spirit of power love and a sound mind amen just quote it to him now let's finish up here this is that good to rehearse those things I think it's so important because we always grow in revelation and understanding of God and look at this as we close here Paul has just said you but you need to be a soldier and now he starts he's writing his letter this is the last time he's gonna contact these Ephesians this is the last letter to the Ephesians he's in prison he's gonna die in a few short years I believe this was written in 54 he died in 56 within 2 years he'll be dead and off the scene the last thing he says are recorded here at the end of this chapter after he says make sure you put on the whole armor of God so let's read let's go to Ephesians let's look at would what would be a profits last words I think it's so beautiful and what are his desires knowing the Holy Spirit said you've got to go to Jerusalem you've got to give your life you're going to die what are some of his last wishes as a Christian prophet now before we get there verse 18 here's what I said earlier to put on our all the armor of God he said pray always so Saints as long as we're meditating in prayer we will have on the armor of God verse 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints now look now do you catch that all prayers whether amen sometime you can say a long 30-minute prayer other times bang I can just say a 1-minute prayer and I've had got to answer those other times I can pray while I'm singing and worshiping and it's a different kind of a prayer but you pray with all prayers at all time all the time you pray throughout the day and when you do that you have you're putting the armor of God on you're hiding behind God's word this is the shield of faith you see that so it's through prayers through communing with God talking with God praising his name not praising the devil but praising God see where I'd be careful oh the devil he's so strong oh the devil he's so sly let's not praise him right we know he slide we know he's slick but we know Christ is greater than Satan praise God he created him praise God well let's praise the Lord he said pray for All Saints praise God see watching as a soldier you're watching I pray for a brother cam praise God I'm gonna pray for brother Simon I'm gonna pray for brother William I talked to William this week on whatsapp so we're praying for you brother I said pray for them I pray for brother Jim in new Pennsylvania we're just watching him praying all the time praying for these people in New York God heal them from coronavirus you know just pray all the time just watching and keeping your sword ready to fight the devil verse 19 let's finish 19 to 24 what are this prophets last wishes if you could write somebody one last letter what would the last words you write be this beautiful 18 to 20 I'm sorry 19 to 20 and for me so you see he said pray for all the things we said don't forget to pray for me I like that phrase gun he's in prison we said pray for everybody pray for me to that what do you pray for for do you pray for riches do you pray for a longer life here's what he prayed for by the bank that utterance may be given unto me hallelujah that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds so see that's what he's saying right now I'm in Chains right now I'm in prison right now that there and I might speak boldly as I ought to speak Church what a picture what if can you picture Paul he's sitting out of chair he's got chains on and he's riding this they said you are armed you were fully other soldiers of God stand strong in Ephesus and pray for me that I can be more bold in prison you know could you just go about prison life you know you sit up you stand up I'm really sore now you gotta sit down you're sore ah and he would lose his boldness there's times you know he interact with the soldiers and he wouldn't be as bold and Paul said just pray for me not that I can live a longer life or have a bigger house or things like this he said but pray for me that I can be more bold with the gospel praise God he's gonna be dying in a couple of years yeah what would your prayer be now I'd say brother bang pray for me I'd get out of jail please pray for me but see Paul had he had prophecy to that he had to go to Rome he had prophecy I know I've got to give my life he says that Christ might be magnified in my death praise God because remember Jesus said I've got to show Paul how much he must suffer for my name sake praise God because he persecuted the Church of God so Jesus said you're gonna have to suffer you're going to be persecuted and then Jesus said then Paul then you'll know me in the power of my resurrection and the Fellowship of my sufferings oh god he's all chained up he said just pray for me sister Lydia just pray for me that one thing I'll be bold and I won't be so shy with the gospel what a prayer what a prayer help me to be bold because that's the reason I am chained up is because I've been preaching the gospel and the Jews hate me and they got they put me in jail pray for me that I can speak the mystery of the gospel of Christ now just to remind you there's 12 mysteries and Paul wrote about 9 of them he was so full of revelation yet he was imprisoned look at this he had he had most of the mysteries he wrote up he's the one that wrote them Jesus showed in the mysteries in Arabia like Simon said he digged out and then he wrote all the mysteries to Romans and Corinthians and he wrote all these ministries and so he's a man with all this revelation of mysteries and on his only prayers I just want to share what you've revealed to me just pray for me Saints that I can just share I can be more bold with the mystery of Christ that he's already revealed to me all he wanted was for a chance to share it with one person how many can say amen to that that's all it's my greatest desire sister Naomi when I go to work her you know I don't go to work now but when I used to God just sent me someone I can share the message with that is the greatest desire of my heart someone who actually wants to listen and once they hear what can God still heal is God this God is the same yesterday today in forever what does the Bible mean with the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is which way is the right way to be baptized my heart jumps every time somebody asked me that like wow huh what I can be bold now because you've asked me that's what Paul says pray for me that I'll be bold that I can speak the mystery of God with boldness that was his prayer as he getting ready to die within a couple years he'd be off the scene a member of the twelve mysteries Israel's blindness that means Israel can be saved even if they're blind they can still be saved because they'll go under the altar in heaven as long as they're faithful blinded Jews God will give them eternal life praise God because he had to blind them to save the Gentiles praise God Paul want to share this yeah I must go I gotta go through faster this is goes too slow I didn't have at least I got these illustrations or these things the rapture was a revelation a mystery like we've been preaching on the Jews and Gentiles are one body now Church it's about opposite for us today this is the chapter I started yesterday riding on this one the mystery was how could God let sinful Gentiles they're so evil and unholy they eat pigs and all these how could God let them into our church and that's what God was saying God was saying it's not about your holiness it's about my holiness praise God and God is like God is bringing how could the Gentiles come in but now we're like the opposite mm like how can the Jews get into this oh nice it's so interesting it's almost opposite now but the revelation is still the same and it allows Christians that have Liberty right some Christians can celebrate you know the Feast of the trumpets and they can celebrate the feast of weeks and the feasts of Passover that don't stumble anybody like if a Holy Ghost feel Christian once they go and eat Passover on this Thursday night or whatever let them do it you know if they want to go have you know and dance the Jewish music that's fine because the the Holy Ghost gives us Liberty within our Christian lives to do those things you say prove it absolutely Paul kept vows remember Paul kept Jewish busts and he said I'm going down to Jerusalem so I can pay my vow and he was the messenger of the gospel he said I want to go down and I want to observe Passover in Jerusalem that was one of Paul's goals before he got arrested which he was able to do boss that means Paul let his hair grow for a while they say I'm gonna keep my my vow and I'm gonna pay my vow there Jerusalem Paul said some people consider this day a holy day and this day's holder than that day Paul said that's fine just have your Liberty he said just don't condemn people that's right so God is so great the mysteries God can bring people from different backgrounds and cultures amen different skin colors and cultures and bring them all together give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they can exist peacefully and lovingly within their convictions and God sees laws one great sweet happy family praise God hey man I know it's a ministry you just wanted to share it with somebody just make me bold so I can share with one of these prison guards or somebody can visit me in prisons I can share with them the New Testament church as the Bride of Christ the Godhead amen godliness restored demands that your perfect man iniquity the Antichrist and the spirit of the Antichrist the seven stars in the hand the seven preachers write to the seven churches oh my Babylon Mystery Babylon Roman Catholic Church the will of God the kingdom of heaven and Christ in you the hope of glory praise God Paul all chained up he said all I want just pray for me that I can share I have all these mysteries you ever feel like that I feel like you're to blame I'm like I'm gonna explode sometimes like I feel like when I'm talking to people just ask me what I believe ask me just ask me he just didn't want to be wimpy with it is that how you feel that's how I feel I just don't want to be a wimp each like a shy Christian I want to be more bold but see I can't do it unless it's God's word for the mystery of God glory verse 21 that ye may also know my affairs and how I do ticki is a beloved brother and faithful minister and the Lord shall make known to you all things so these Ephesians they want to know how does Paul run the affairs of his life how does Paul do his finances how does Paul a witness how does Paul do church they want to know his affairs how's his trial going so Paul said I'm gonna let tickets know he's a faithful preacher I'm let him know my affairs and he's gonna share him with you right Paul wanted the Saints to know his affairs this means his practices undertaking what is Paul trying to do how is he grown closer to the Lord what's his behavior like in jail yes as we said his lawsuits you know he's he's on trial they want to know what was Paul's practice like how did he behave every day and that's what this message did for us pray I'm gonna Jose that's like God that loud ready to start taking those tapes in 1947 Ray's God amen so we can know how does the Prophet act like amen what is a practice of a prophet amen what is his life like Hansie handles affairs he hung with himself to the IRS right he paid that $40,000 now it's through a millionaire that God sent him brother Dow a millionaire see God provides for all of our needs praise God Satan sent a trap I'm gonna get you on those taxes and so God said imma send a millionaire in a church to pay the bill for him hey man any battle church for two or three years on that till God sent that millionaire in there so you'd go to be the scourge he was doing the right thing - he was in the right thing given all the money to the ministry he had a struggle for years he lied to the IRS he he fell short Lord out but God had all ordained it to give him a way out in the hour of temptation praise God God gave him a way out I'll send an old 90 year old man there I'll heal him I'll give him a thus saith the Lord and then his money still to this day is paying for that school in Lima it's called Bible believers school his money his investments of that brother Dow is continuing the Bride of Christ today that's how God wants to use money right it's not the big build big buildings it's not a big building very small but they keep investing it every year and they live off the interest and it keeps those children in a safe spot where they're out from the public school though there are some good public schools out there right sister Naomi we know I got a good school we can worship Jesus there but there's some evil ones and so God raise up that brother to have all those funds to help his prophet get off the IRS but also to train the next generations oh god is so wise Church God is so wise hallelujah this is why brother Branham had all these tapes recorded so we could know how does the Prophet act when he's in pressure how does the Prophet act when he's outnumbered with ministers how does a prophet prophet act when he's surrounded by a deadly bull or kill Hermes they praise God amen how does he act when he neat when he's a lot of pressure how does he act he goes out and spends time with the Lord he says honey I'm going the prayer closet so I can pray to the Lord how is he accurate his family's out of control I'll go over and wash dishes see he shows us his practices makes known their affairs and that gives us a lot of wisdom on how we should do our affairs remember these Ephesians knew Paul better than anybody else cuz he was there at least three years because he said I've warned you with tears for three years that wolves are gonna come in not sparing the flock so nobody knew Paul better and Paul said pray for me that I can be bold and I can share this message really boldly he said I'm sending tickets to show you how I live my life that you'll know how to conduct your life it sounds like the Christians neither the same help we need we need comfort look at ya the Cayennes it here's his last words before he dies now this is to the Ephesians not him he had other books like second Timothy was actually his last letter but this is these are the last words he'd say to the Ephesians whom I've set unto you for the same purpose that you might know my affairs and that he might comfort your hearts so you know you you know it would comfort them church to hear God's prophet is in jail but he's keeping the faith praise God he hasn't given up he hasn't cursed he's not defeated God's prophet is in jail but he wants your prayer so he can witness in the jail oh what a comfort amen to know that the ever abiding presence of Jesus Christ is so powerful that it he'll be with you in your house but be with you at the church he'll be with you in your darkest hour even if you're in a jail Jesus Christ spirit will be with you praise God hey man what a comfort he's not losing his hope because he's got God's Spirit he's sealed by the Holy Ghost down in a soul praise God see tickets will comfort your hearts and then verse 23 peace be to the Brethren what's the last thing you say may God fill you with his peace and love may God fill you with peace comfort love and faith are those things Paul could buy for them no these things have to come through Jesus Christ that all prayer all prayer and supplication you mentioned earlier all these things peace comfort love faith they all come from praying so what does Paul basically saying stay close to God through prayer right there yeah stay close to God the last thing I wish you is comfort peace love and faith if you'll pray God will give that to you from God the there and the Lord Jesus Christ from the invisible god the father to the visible son the image of the invisible God the Lord Jesus Christ I say into our feet grace be with all them that love and musicians can come that love our Lord Jesus Christ in all sincerity he said the last thing he says may you have sincerity that means purity Church so what's the last thing Paul says God give them peace love comfort faith and let them be sincere but then be pure from in corruption what would your last words be won't be the last words you would say if you were going off the scene these are the ones Paul cried with he said brothers come around here let's pray I know wolves are gonna come in let's pray for three years I've cried with you O God protect them from the wolves what would your last words be God give them peace God give them comfort give them faith and love and may the Grace and love of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you and may you be sincere how many want to be sincere today let's pray for that God just and sincerity means purity help us to be innocent right that also that means just confess our sins acknowledge we did wrong and say God help me to overcome that temptation next time the last words from a genuine vindicated prophet of god let's pray the same for us today by God's grace if you have need a special prayer I'll give you a chance to come up after this prayer but that's of our heads forward a prayer here Heavenly Father we've combed this scripture Lord God like your prophet said we preach scripture by scripture we can see the mind of the Holy Spirit hide behind the shield of faith amen hide in Christ and watch and pray for other people that you can protect them hallelujah and pray for me that I'll be bold even as a locked up prisoner the Lord we see the heart of a prophet the things he wants for the Ephesians are peace comfort love and faith and sincerity Lord that's what I want I know that's what brother Branham wanted for us Peter wonder that for us unfeigned faith Peter said amen genuine faith nor the things I want for this church are things that I cannot buy we don't need a bigger church we don't need more money we need peace love faith comfort sincerity thank you Lord Father in Jesus Christ's name I pray these things for to give us boldness Lord open my mouth and boldness Lord o wherever I am dear God that I may speak the truth and love your Lord I might make know the revelation of this mystery contained in your Bible [Music] nor let your people piece-by-piece put on your armor Lord God and they can stand and fight against the wiles of the devil and knock off all the darts and pray always with all prayer Nessus with these promises I know you'll do it Lord God because your word is alive yeah it's active it's more powerful than a double-edged sword the word has life so all we receive that life today in Jesus Christ's name the church said anyone needs prayer more than welcome to come up I guess there's that six feet of distance thing but I can still anoint you and pray for you I just won't pray right in your face anyone eats prayer praise God nothing Lord today oh I love the Lord don't you I love just to dig in these scriptures and see the heart of a man of God the real true the last words a man would say to somebody before he's taken off the scene may God give you peace brother Jose may he give you comfort may God give you faith may God give you love God fill my heart with your comfort give me boldness Lord Jesus these are the things he pray for then if we have those be the happiest people in the world break out we're the most thankful people in the world whether we're chained up to a chair and table like Paul or whether were chained up to our homes through a quarantine sometimes I feel chained up I'd like to get out more often to myself no matter what we're chained up to we could have the peace of God in our hearts we can raise our attic we just raise our hands there's a problem son they can just raise our hands let's see that song I will pray some I will praise them praise the lamb for sinners slain we've seen that by God's grace and it just raised our palms as they did 2000 years ago

okay I you know was talking to by the Amen last night on the phone just briefly about Psalm 27 Psalm 27 is the rapture scripture 27 one to five so just read that I'm not gonna preach on it yet maybe I preach on a Wednesday I just want to read it is it's such a comfort to me so I'm 27 one the Lord is my light and salvation whom shall I fear if you got light who will you be afraid of and one's gonna get you the dark you got light nobody's gonna sneak up on you the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid all of our strength comes to the Lord when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell so David saw all these enemies coming and they would stumble and fall before they could get to go in host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise up against me in this will I be confident even if a war comes against me what did Trump call this a war this is invisible war were fighting the war come against me so I won't be afraid verse four why because one thing I've desired of the Lord and that will I seek after he wasn't gonna seek after all the battles and he's gonna seek out for one thing that I might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple so the midst of all this trouble where'd he want to be in the house of God he want to be in God's presence enjoying the beauty of God's Word the beauty of God's promises verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
