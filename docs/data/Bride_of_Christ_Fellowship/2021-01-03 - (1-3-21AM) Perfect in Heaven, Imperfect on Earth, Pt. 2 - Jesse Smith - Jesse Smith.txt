me thy servant anoint all of us to hear in jesus christ the church said amen god bless you let's stand here we'll take our bibles here praise god let's go to the book of job chapter one i'm going to start as you probably saw in the text i'm going to start back up with the memory verses so i gave everybody a month so any time before that month just let me know the the scripture you'd like to memorize for that month and we'll keep doing that by the grace of the lord i gave uh some of the individuals like i gave hua an individual month uh my wife an individual month and malachi and lydia just so we got all 12 months filled right because we ended up i think we stopped doing it in october or something like that and i just kind of finished up and then kind of forgot about it so this will give everybody a month here to just you know share scripture that blesses their heart and that we could memorize together and have the holy spirit write it upon our hearts i don't see vang yet so maybe we'll read our text and maybe he'll walk in hopefully in a few minutes by god's grace job chapter 1. and then we'll read uh another verse in job and then we'll do our the memory verse i'm choosing is from david so we'll read that in just a moment but job chapter one let's read verse 8. this is such a beautiful scripture we looked at it on friday how god places job as perfect i think it's beautiful don't you if god was going to judge you or judge me by a standard and declare us perfect how would he do it he'd have to do it the same way because he's the same yesterday today and forever let's read verse 8 together ready one two three and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and a skeweth evil now i want to read another one job go to job 38. now notice job just told the devil job's perfect but when job cut when god comes to job he says who is this right he doesn't say hey job you're a perfect man thank you mr perfect for being a witness thanks for being a message believer mr perfect is that how god addresses job on the earth no he addresses him as a father with a son that needs help and correction now i'll read verse one and two then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge so in heaven god's like job's perfect he's perfect but on earth he's like who are you job see how god deals with us differently he deals with the devil in a certain way regarding us they're perfect they're forgiven but with us father to son he speaks to humble us that we don't get too exalted and think we're so much like him that we don't need him anymore how many need the lord today now my choice for memory verse is first samuel 17 47 just a real short verse this is right before david slays goliath first samuel 17 47. and i hope it's prophetic i believe it will you know because i'm i'm sure it'll be prophetic in many ways because we'll all have battles this year right and some of us will share our battles in the prayer requests but this assembly will know that god saves us by his power amen not by our power but by his power amen and of course he showed that he's he showed us this year after year after year but i just i the scripture came to my mind this morning after prayer and uh i thought i really like this verse so let's let's read this together may this be our memory verse may god help us remember this during january first samuel 17 47 let's read it on three one two three and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands he's speaking to goliath right that enemy will be given into our hands amen we'll overcome the enemy may god add the blessings the reading of his word you may be seated praise god i'm going to send a quick text of ang i usually don't uh text from the pulpit right but let me send a quick text and see if he's coming if not uh i still want to recognize our uh helpers here say are you uh coming to morning service say god bless you are you coming to morning service let's see if he comes here if i get a text from him in the next few minutes it's a true uh pleasure to serve the lord uh let's hear i got some slides here oh there's bang right there but i just sent you a text praise god all right amen thank the lord god's got a good sense of humor praise god so you can switch over to some slides maokai here this subject is just a beautiful i hope it's encouraging you it really encouraged me um as i've been studying the last week or so so i'm sorry bang but can you come up here real quick brother i just want to recognize uh bang as an officer he's been officer all 14 years brother we're coming to our 15th year in june by god's grace he's been an officer now his his workload differs from year to year but he'll constantly come to the church and do work and help out and we couldn't have all the blessings of the uh the technology without brother bang he's run all these wires i think he's gotta put he had to put all these wires through the ceiling and everything and every time i need brother bang he's right there uh he drove dennis back to the uh airport that monday after so i didn't have to so i could study and so i could study now i like dennis and i love our fellowship but i would at that moment i'd rather would have studied because i got to get studied up for the next service so bang that means the world to me brother we love you so much i hope this can be a little blessing to your family let's give another bang round of applause thank you sir god bless you buddy thank you for your faithful service all these years thank you buddy i love you god bless you thanks james uh i like maokai and amen to come up here would you guys come up here please and just stand together here um they're not officers we'd say as far as like officially voted upon but without them and i have a little gift for lydia too i without them you know we wouldn't have the great worship services that we have um i'm especially thankful because my voice gets to save a little bit i don't have to lead songs so i am especially grateful and to see all the people come in here every guest minister comes in here says how much they enjoy our worship remember uh brother uh uh isaiah brooks did it when he was here i mean just each one of them dennis mcbride i mean they all come out and say well you guys have a great worship service and that's because of brother amen's dedication and malachi so we want to thank them and i hope that's just a little uh expression of our love and our gratitude for the songs let's give them round applause god bless you amen love you buddy it's just a little token of our love buddy thank you so much appreciate you thank you hallelujah appreciate you love you buddy thank you for your dedication keep being dedicated once a year you know if we just give them a little a love i think that's a good thing to do i got two more so i want to thank uh hua and acacia can you come up here can you just stand up here is that okay i just want to do something real small just tell you show you where's acacia haven go get a case you talk just bring genevieve up here she's going to cry anyway so you know how two-year-olds are you know they can't help it but you know every time so when my family isn't here who will step up like this morning and she'll just do the songs and then anytime brother amen has a new song many times who will type it in there for us but amen does it too we really appreciate that uh but every time i've asked sister who you know can you go back into the songs many times i don't have to ask her because she already she's aware of it like that and then uh other nights like wednesday nights occasions always on the computer so come up here okay just bring up genevieve i just want to thank them for just being there every service you know just faithful every service that they can be just a small token of my appreciation also the saints here so let's give them a round of applause god bless you sisterhood thank you for your dedication god bless you we love you my lord god bless you honda your dedication we appreciate it thank you jeffy praise the lord so i'm so thankful you know uh for everybody's efforts and all the saints um you know each year i just like to take a little time and thank every you know all those that are officially helping out in those certain areas we appreciate it uh we're thankful to the lord for all his blessings um and like i don't know if naomi was here when i uh yeah i think she was out in ghana when i said this but you know with sister wendy leaving we lost a little chunk of our income so i'll be probably having less guest ministers um it's either that or i give them less money so i don't know i don't know it's kind of like a mind battle you know what i mean like uh because we love having this place and i love i was just driving in today i said thank you lord for this place i love this place i love having a house of god where we can worship the lord but i'm going to try to limit the guest preachers like i said try and so that means more preaching on my part but i don't mind that i certainly love to preach i've been it's my call of god so uh just uh be let's all be thankful and uh rejoice in what god has done for us and uh we'll see you know what the lord allows here in 2021. uh like i told you i have new numerous visions for this year i wrote my seven goals out for this year one of them is to maybe start that outreach ministry i talked about so i need cam's help with that and i'll need maybe amen and vang's help on that maybe jose and steven whoever feels led to do it but i just have a great burden to go out to churches and just to tell them who i am and who we are and what we believe so like paul paul went to the synagogues two by two you know him and barnabas and i just feel led to do something i got to do something more by god's grace so i don't know how that'll work out but that's my that's one of my desires for 2021. all right so let me just start preaching here i'll probably just talk all day and tell you how much i love everybody and i certainly do love everybody so great to have naomi back in the girls and uh beatrice how's it been at home has it been better at home hey we were joking one time and she she was saying uh can't wait to get all the the noise back in the house right that's how you know i got my eight kids there's a lot of annoyers you know so i'm sure that's a blessing to have all that noise back amen amen praise god thank god for his grace and mercy they grow up so fast you know lydia's 16 she don't make as much noise anymore you know so uh but we're so thankful for god's amazing grace i just hope this you know these i'll maybe preach one or two more sermons on this but i just hope this thought is a blessing to know that in heaven god sees you as perfect so between demons god exalts you as perfect because remember the bible says whoever god whoever humbles themselves god will exalt so in heaven god exalts you and i to such a spot where the satan can't even get anything on us because he humbles i'm sorry he exalts the humble praise god and the prideful he abases so remember the bible said we're seated in heavenly places so one application of that not just being in the mind of god here but one application of that as well is that god is a witness for us up in heaven we're we're we're exalted up in heaven as to being perfect before the throne of god what a privilege church amen that god can take us up in heavenly places and stand for us and say to the devil and all his accusers that my child is perfect have you considered him or her praise god have you seen such a witness have you seen such a love for me and we can stand there uh and we can stand on earth and be confident that god is pleading our case in heaven amen now just reviewing part one remember all the blessings from part one i hope uh the heavenly council remember there's a heavenly council going on and god stands for us but as god's standing for us remember we must be sober and vigilant because it's like we're being hunted down on earth satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour so we must keep on the armor of god church amen but god sees us and i love how god how god stands up for job how does god vindicate that job is perfect to the devil because he fears god and he hates evil and he's upright when he makes a mistake he says i'm sorry lord forgive me before he makes a decision he consults god because he wants to fear god he wants to respect god first before making decisions and when evil is presented when satan brings evil directly to him he turns it down praise god that's how god vindicates you as perfect as well when satan brings you a chance to enjoy sin turn it down amen you make a mistake you're upright you say you're sorry and you get back to your right standing with god amen that's how god determines who's perfect to the devil amen all right thank god for that remember heaven says you're loved in heaven right you're loved in heaven now uh i'm just skipping through these here uh these previous slides from the the earlier service on friday thank god we have jesus christ as an advocate in heaven praise god he's standing for us he's pleading our case against all the devils that are bringing accusations against us amen and nobody could argue a case like jesus amen we know he'll win because he already defeated satan on earth satan brought his best arguments and jesus said it's written praise god so we know if he won that debate there on earth he's going to win every debate in heaven praise god so our desire church is to just live upright confess our sins praise god now remember job was such a godly man now let's go over this real quick job made widows shout for joy because he helped him out he made the fatherless shout for joy he loved his enemies he didn't trust in his money and he helped strangers he also refused to lust after pretty women right because he overcame the mind battles what a man of god amen so this is how we fear god right this is how we escape evil so in our personal lives and in our pride in our public lives and our personal lives we always try to rid ourselves from evil but brother bam did say he did have a great battle with fear right the bible says he had a great battle with fear and because of fear this test seems like it came upon him because he feared he would lose everything but then we saw how god was gracious and god was merciful god brought him through the trial praise god and we saw that job was perfect in heaven by the blood just as we are perfect in heaven by the blood of jesus amen glory now starting today let's look at some of job's harshest words you want to see him i was listening to it reading through it this morning job had some pretty harsh words here now get your bibles to go to job 9 22 and 23 please actually just do job 9 17. let's start there job 9 17. now church remember we are not downgrading job or anything like that and let me say this again john the baptist no jesus said the greatest in the new testament is greater than anyone in the old testament now i believe that but i never want to exalt myself above them so i always say i always say old testament saints have more faith than me because i'm trying to humble myself does everybody understand but somehow in some way are they amen jesus says those least in the kingdom of heaven are greater than john the baptist now i'll let god do i'll let god say that i'm not going to say that about myself because i've never suffered like this man i've never lost 10 children i've never had boils for months where i can't sleep i've never had that so i'm not going to say we're greater i'm not going to say i'm greater than job i'll let god say whatever he wants that's up to god does everybody understand amen i'm not contradicting the scripture i'm trying to humble myself right we're trying to humble ourselves we're not trying to see how prideful we can be we're trying to see how humble we can be praise god okay so hopefully everybody understands job 9 17. now before we read this remember he started off strong he went right to the house of god i'm sorry he got right on his knees and said the lord gives the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord amen but as the trial went on his faith got weaker his spirit mind got weaker and it was harder to fight the battles so that's why i really got to pray for brother jose as weeks may go on he may start having more mind battles about his eyes we don't know but if you go through a trial you may start strong but you'll need the prayers of the saints to bring you through just like peter needed jesus prayer he said don't fear don't fear peter i pray for you that your faith doesn't fail hallelujah praise god so your prayers are so important for jose now for each one of us church when we go through the trials they're so crucial job 9 17. now look at this he break for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds here it is here's the sin of job without cause god is allowing me to be afflicted without cause in other words he's saying i'm perfect i've done nothing wrong but the bible says he feared he had great fear i'm going to show you later the bible says he had iniquity church i'm going to show it to you from the scripture so see why we we know job is perfect in heaven he was still a man you know as much as we want to think we're perfect on earth we're not and church this has really helped me to understand brother branham because job was a prophet too and you're going to see some of these scriptures job had some he had some faults he had some he had some weaknesses but god didn't see it in heaven amen brother adam had some weaknesses he said some things he maybe shouldn't have said right he had some human faults and failures but according to the blood the blood forgives him and god sees him as a perfect prophet amen hallelujah amen so he says i'm getting all this and there's no cause no there's always a cause because god god can't tempt you the bible said god can't tempt you right so in other words any trial comes it's a consequence of something we've done right because the bible said god will not tempt any man so see god could not allow uh job to be tempted without there a cause for it i hope that makes sense i hope i'm saying it right i'll just say like graham said let if i can't get out in my english let the holy spirit reveal it to you praise god amen if i can't get the words and i can't order them the right way may the holy spirit help you understand anyway amen so what i'm saying is joe what i'm saying is job and you and i deserve every test that we go through every spanking we get from god we deserve it that's what i'm trying to say okay so job is getting spanked here because the bible said every every son that comes to god must be chastened and that means beat with the rod i showed you that a few months ago hebrews 12 that means it hit with the rod so job needed i said like this job needed this you and i need our trials right we need god to correct us we need god to take out our bad parts okay so he says god's done this with no cause oh no there was a cause there was we're gonna see it in the scripture here go to verse 22. oh no wait uh yeah this is one thing therefore i say it he destroyeth the perfect with the wicked look at this verse 23 if the scourge slays suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the innocent now look at this church job says god is going to laugh when the innocent die quickly is that what the scripture says let me read again if this if the scourge slays suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the innocent a scourging right god is gonna laugh at innocent people getting uh spanked right or suffering does that sound right is that right the bible said god is very compassionate he's slow to anger the bible said god pities his children as a father pity of his children so job says two things wrong here oh there's i don't deserve this well yeah you do praise god thank god yeah we do deserve our tests and trials we do we do deserve spanking sometimes and then job said god laughs or makes fun of people that go when they're innocent being s and they're suffering well first of all how do you just say how do you say they're innocent on earth we're never truly innocent uh perfect on earth right because eventually we'll sin well now we're not innocent anymore we might go for a few hours we might go for the part of the day we don't sin but pretty soon church sometime in the day we're going to think or say the wrong thing we're going to get selfish we're going to wish bad on somebody right we're going to get jealous of somebody pretty soon we're gonna just fall short of god's glory so i hope that helps you now go to job three since we're here i mentioned this earlier in job one and two job is praising god he's saying the lord gives the lord takes away he's overcoming but in chapter 3 verse 1 i like how amen saying on this this morning after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day and job spake and said let the day perish wherein i was born and the night in which it was said this there's a a man child conceived let let that day be dark and let not god regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it so he curses the very day he was born right because before he's saying bless the lord bless the lord but now he starts saying i wish i was never born a church i think we can all relate to this sometimes we're really giving god praise we're really getting the victory and sometimes we're losing the battle praise god sometimes we're winning tonight it's glorious and we're confessing and then we have tests and trials and we embarrass ourselves remember verse 25 for the thing which i greatly fear just come upon me he had a great fear all the time he sacrificed and even praising god sometimes he'd cycle back you know we go through cycles oh we're on the mountaintop then we're in the valley mountain top valley mountain in one of those cycles in the valley he said i'm going to lose everything i'm scared i'm going to lose everything and the trial church brought this to the forefront because then he says god laughs at people when they're punished god laughs at the innocent and this is happening without cause i don't deserve this well yeah the bible says you break one law you're guilty of the whole the bible said there's none that seeketh after god the bible said all we like sheep ran from jesus right that's what isaiah 53 says so i hope we're starting to see this i hope you and i can better understand some of job's harsh words now go we read 17 23 now go to job now i i got some up here i didn't write down but go to job 16 verse 9. i put this one in my notes and i didn't put it i didn't have time for the powerpoint you know i tried to get up at 5am this morning i guess i was so tired i slept until 6 50. so almost lost two hours of study time i guess my body needed it but i'd like to get up early at 5 00 a.m just i can study and get all these quotes so you can see them you know sorry i slept in this morning so 16 9 9. no my oh my look at this first mercy jesus god help us god help us verse 9 he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me and yet church god was up there saying he's perfect devil he hates evil so god is saying good things about job and now god and job's not saying good things about god that's just like jesus john the baptist remember that jose john's like disciples don't see him he's the one that's he's a watershed we look for another ah and then when they come to jesus jesus said hang around and see the glory of god amen he said if i tell you john is a great man he said he's a prophet i said he's more than a prophet he's the voice of one that cries in the wilderness in other words god is always saying good things about you and i even when we say bad things about him because we're human he said he hates me and yet god is up there saying god's telling the devil i've got to hedge about him because i love him so much thank god amen i love him so much i'm protecting him with fences glory with walls i'm protecting job nothing can get through that wall i'm protecting him because i love him i may let you know the devil come in through the head sometimes and i may remove the hedge for a while but i love job but job after months and months of not sleeping and months and months the bible said his skin was black with bruises right or rotting skin rotting flesh right like a man's shirt his skin was like black like that rotting off he said i haven't slept in months and he says god hates me and then later we're going to find out god has to correct this man god doesn't hate him god's testing him god is refining him god is taking out his impurities and making him more pure praise god god help us amen may god bring this to our remembrance when we suffer trials this year i could have used this when i had coronavirus that day and a half i laid on the bed but i was i was saying like bang i was saying like bang i was saying this is lying man he's lying man he's in between my moaning in between my cry lying man and he's lying vanities and i didn't really feel anything other than the pain of being sick isn't that amazing god hates me no god loves you god died for you amen he gnasheth upon me with his teeth so you like he takes a big bite of you that's what job says he's biting me he's gnashing on me with his teeth mine enemy sharpened his eyes upon me so he's letting my enemies just hunt me down that's what he says actually look at verse uh verse look at verse seven but now he hath made me weary thou has made desolate all my company so he's blaming god for making me weak right oh sometimes we say well i'm so weak i'm so weak spiritually and it's god's fault that's what he's saying it's god's fault i'm not stronger spiritually no no no no it's our fault praise god it's our fault because we're the ones who let down the guard we're the ones who instead of praising god start doubting god we're the ones instead of seeking god we seek other things of the world i hope this is helping somebody praise god yeah amen so we did 16. uh i guess job 27 has a lot let's go to job 27 verse 2. [Music] 27 verse 1 and 2. moreover joe continued his parable and said is god liveth now look at that he's almost like speaking speaking for god as god liveth if there's a god in heaven as just as there's a god in heaven he says he's taken away my judgment in other words god's not dealing justly with job god's misjudging the situation with job now can you imagine that in other words there's a court list there's a court in heaven and god judged the wrong thing he judged me wrong my lawyer god he argued my case the wrong case and i lost the case because god it was his fault praise god church i'm just reading you the bible same bible we've been preaching these last 14 years right oh job didn't deserve it oh no no he did he did he had great fear he was a man if brother branham sinned thousands of times a year with the holy ghost baptism in the soul what do you think job did there's a reason church he was offering all those lambs right there's a reason he's offering all those bullocks he's a man but we make it look like oh he never sinned he's only perfect by the blood he's only perfect by the forgiveness of god's grace amen that was the only way he was perfect in other words he keeps coming back to jesus hey amen oh god help us amen you see you keep coming back to church that's what i'm saying [Music] and receive god's blessings amen amen good verse now look look at verse six my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go look how prideful he was and later god's gonna say god says how prideful he was i didn't do anything wrong and i'm not gonna budge look how stubborn we can be sometimes i know it's god's father i know something's wrong with other people it's their fault not mine see pointing and everybody else he's got all those fingers pointing back at him right i'm not i'm not budget i'm so stubborn i'm not going to budge i've done anything wrong well your words tell what you've done wrong from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh god hates me trials i don't deserve any of these trials that's not true god loves you yeah and there should there's consequences to every action right just like blessings and cursing like i was telling my dad every time you say something negative about yourself that spirit hangs around well i'll never be any good i'll never do this i'm a worthless person that devil hangs around you're going to suffer the consequences of that but say you're sorry and confess the right thing resist satan and he's got to flee amen glory don't live under those curses don't live under those lies let the tree set you free amen look at verse 8 for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained when god taketh away his soul will god hear verse 9 hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him will he delight himself in the almighty will he always call upon god i will teach you by the hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal so now he's talking like he's got all this he's got all this wisdom church we should be wise but we shouldn't brag about it because then it becomes pride and we lost our wisdom see there's so much to learn from the book of job and i've just this just even this morning it's opened up in a way i've never seen it before um we'll get to more so let's i did my list okay now let's look at this beautiful type here uh go to uh job uh let me see go to job 32 yeah job chapter 32. brother braham said elijah is a perfect type of christ oh man this is beautiful i can't wait to preach this here i'm gonna i was anxious to preach it all morning all right job32 now we're gonna we're now i'm gonna show you a few things i hope this is a blessing joe or eli who perfectly types jesus christ all right here's what brother brahm said then when his church members came and could not console him accuse him of being a secret sinner said he'd sin before god job knew he not sinned and he knew he was all right now that's generally speaking right because we know he had some of these fears inside of him so every time in other words every time he sacrificed he was forgiven but he still had mind battles can you say amen we still got complexes can anybody say amen to that yeah right like there are certain ones i'm thinking of right now and i'm not gonna feed those i'm not gonna say him out loud because i don't i don't want to worry about him but i pray in my home my children will hear me i'll pray in my home about two or three certain things god please don't let this happen please don't let this happen and i don't want to speak it out loud because i don't want to create any complexes in you or my children but there are certain things i just i'm worried about year after year right and so i just pray blessings jesus bless and protect my family and children in jesus christ's day just keep blessing praise god keep blessing because we all have inner we have all have inner fears we might lose something we really love but then god sent a young man down by the name of elihu come down to meet job perfect type of christ again oh hallelujah amen look at job 32 verse 1. so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes in the church he has made himself more righteous than god that's what that's what job is accused of by elijah the perfect type of christ he's accused that he has made himself smarter and wiser and a better judge than god verse 2 then was kind of the wrath of elijah the son of bearer rachel the bazi of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindled because why he justified himself rather than god and church that happens every time every time people reject god's way for their own way they just justified themselves more than god like this here's an easy example well i don't need to go to church and hear the preaching anymore i don't get anything out of it right there you've justified yourself more than god because god says if you come here you'll be perfected you'll be equipped every blessing will not be withholding from you in the house of god amen amen right because that's what the bible says the five-fold ministry produces those five blessings remember exact knowledge unity all these blessings that's what the so when someone says i don't got to go to church see what happens they're justifying themselves instead of what god's word says that's just a simple example there ah god's word isn't true that's not really true i don't really need that see how people can do it so easily they don't even realize what they're doing anytime they say my way is better than god's way they're justifying themselves more than god i don't need to repent to that person ah i don't need to pay my tithes i have to follow that scripture what are they doing they're exalting themselves i'm a better judge than god i know how to run my life better than god no you don't praise god god gave us these books this instruction that we can be free happy joyful praise god we can be blessed we can get through the trials amen and we can learn to love god and love his people who gets all fired up brother man he gets off uh you're gonna see why this is good brother amen you're gonna like this here you're gonna see why it's the wine building up church yeah here's the scripture amen the wine is built up it's maturing in him praise god this fire is building up in elijah because he hears all these things that are not right with the word he's sitting there listening he's like i'll wait my turn he likes these three older men go he lets joe go and all that time that wine is getting stronger and it's growing inside of him growing growing he calls it a fire in this scripture the wrath is like a fire burning up and he's just got to say something you ever had that church where you just got gotta say something to somebody and you let it stew and you let it stew and you know it's not you you know it's god with my dad this week i've had that student on my heart and mind for a few weeks there that's when cam said i could come i i went up for prayer after i preached and fasted all day on that wednesday night i went up for prayer i said can't pray for me that i'll say exactly what god wants me to say because it was burned by the bank it was burning and building it was building up praise god i just had to say it and then you wait for the right time and then you just let it flow by the grace of god one of the happiest days of my life i'll say it like that i've had a lot of happy days now don't get me wrong that was a great happy day to be able to tell my dad exactly here's where you've sinned here's where people tried to curse you and here's how you get rid of it the blood of jesus christ amen forgiveness and love overcomes hatred amen church if you want to witness to your parents or you want to witness to somebody just keep praying about it say god give me some wine and mature give me the words to say give me the opportunity to say it praise god his brother bang i told my sister betsy about wanting to write a letter to my mom and dad probably a decade ago i remember sitting in their old home and i almost had to let her finish then 10 years pass i forget about it and then look at this in the last two months god has given me grace to address them both by god's grace because there's a time and season for everything praise god and god has given me the desires of my heart praise god and i'm just going to worship and rejoice that god's going to save him amen i'm going to say thank you jesus amen because if he's allowed me to express the truth when i always want to express i'm trusting him to finish the rest of it amen thank the lord amen a perfect type of christ look at this church job cried for a kinsman and then god heard his prayer he's in the midst church of switching back from faith to unbelief faith you know doing good doing bad and in the midst of there he says god send send me a dazeman that i could have someone come between god and me all right so let me get that scripture on the days here let me pull it up here i got it later on but i think i'll just get to it uh so then you can see it right now if you've got your bible go to job19 we'll read that while we're here yeah go to job19 25. remember job doesn't stop talking until the end of job chapter 31. so in job 19 he has this great experience but he's still not done complaining and that's a word he actually uses i'm not making that up job actually says i'm giving complaints before god i'm complaining about god okay so i'm letting you know that's job's words you know and you know why i can say it so plainly because i complain sometimes too and i'm guilty of it and i sin and i fall short of god's glory but i want god to renew my strength like the eagle praise god just like you did job amen when i fall short i want god to raise me up and give me strength and i can rise up above that next time and i can overcome the trial praise god job 19 this is this is one of the highlight scriptures of the entire book right remember this is chapter 19 in 27 he said god hates me see how we can go from shouting on sunday to complaining on tuesday are you gonna be sure are you gonna think we can go from seeing visions with amen or we see something spiritual or god touched me and then a few days later god hates me you know why because we're human and you know what god wants us to teach us to be real servants of god and sometimes we learn the best is when we're humbled and embarrassed job 19 25 i praise god ah i feel the holy spirit this morning look at verse 23 oh that my words are written oh that they were printed in a book that they were graven and look they were being written in a book that they were graving with the iron pen and lead in the rock forever now look just this is how much he thinks he's right god has been wrong god judged it wrong i judge it right he said let my words be written in steel and rock because i'm right i don't know i don't know about you church but that sounds pretty confident praise god oh let's make a monument out there and it will inscribe my quotes in there because i'm right verse 25 for now here now here he starts getting into the spirit right here verse 25. for i know okay i'm sorry yeah this is the right this these are the right things he wants to say forgive me these are the right things he wants to say so this is good this is what we do want written in steel here sorry verse 25 for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth who's he speaking of cries amen hallelujah so this is in the middle of his struggle he has this revelation i know a redeemer and i see him i see him he's a man and he's standing on the earth praise god amen and he says and those after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i'll see god in other words by the way he saw his own body resurrected amen so he saw his body die in the vision he sees jesus break out walk on the earth right at the rapture praise god amen or maybe it was jerusalem after the resurrection he saw himself go to the ground he says he sees worms eating up his body and then he sees jesus christ raising from the dead and then he sees that body resurrected and he sees himself standing with jesus christ amen hallelujah this is in the middle of the trial it's not even the end we would think oh after i got a revelation it's all over not not not every time oh god touch me at church and i feel forgiven and i feel blessed it's the end of my trial it may not be just hang on though try to hang on to the victory as long as you can church verse 26 though after my skin warms destroy this body yet in my flesh i shall see god whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and none other though my reigns be consumed within me now let me show you uh job 9 33 you got your bibles there let me show you where he asks this is beautiful in the midst of his complaining and then rejoicing complaining rejoicing sounds like our week sounds like last week right complaining rejoicing on fire discouraged huh thinking that many amen is on that but i don't know heaven saying that right happy down excited frustrated hopeful hopeless so in the midst of all these back and forth job says i just wish i had a mediator someone that could talk between god and me verse 32 for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we should come together in judgment neither is there any days men between us that's a kinsmen redeemer that might lay his hand upon us both so see he's having this argument this this frustration with god he said i wish we could have somebody between us that could stand there and help us to talk it over praise god amen so he prays for this and then god gives him a revelation of this in chapter 19. and then god sends a partial revelation of this through eli who praise god amen hallelujah since t-shirts even the midst of our trials make your requests unto god the ones that have a sincere attempt will be answered amen your prayers that you set the right sphere with they'll be answered praise god see that he was up and down up just like our months right in our weeks up and down up and down but in the midst of those hard times he'll make some good requests and god hears those two because thank you for the bad words right but he'll answer your honest requests he asked for a daze man right and even the promise even promised the days been in a receipt for a redeemer in a vision see god knows we need multiple experiences reminders encouragements signs how many times did god have to visit abraham before he finally got isaac over and over and over how many signs of gideon needed at least three signs before he would go out and fight the midianites which was a multitude of armies none of us have ever did that right see that's that's the loving god god teaches you over time to love him and trust him more you struggle he'll give you another sign you struggle he gives you another victory you struggle he'll give you a dream you struggle he'll give you a healing just keep shrugging just keep fighting against the devil and keep on the fire lines hey man here's where he asked for yeah i just i should have seen that see there's no there's no days between there's no one here between god and i there's no one as a mediator but the bible says there's there's one god and one meteor between god and man the man christ jesus amen so joe recognized i i need someone that could that can feel what i feel there it is right there amen i feel like god you just can't understand i need somebody that can kind of stand between both of us and god knew it that was his son jesus amen because he suffered and was tempted in all points like we are tempted again and the bible said he could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen now we got somebody that can stand between us it's not a second person either right someone that can stand between us and understand both sides oh hallelujah praise god so i'm going to go through some of the best words of elihu to read boy it hasn't seemed like it's just been five minutes here so i just got something to read to you church here just just let's read here so a lot elijah comes out and he's like i'm fired up i got the fire of god against job remember proverbs is a perfect type of christ as many as i love i rebuke oh brother jesse appreciate a real rebuking sermon today hopefully it wasn't me church it could be me but hopefully it was christ behind me amen and that would be his love to you if it was the right spirit not his anger his love because as many as i love our you can chase him also against his three friends was his wrath kindly because they found no answer and yet they condemned job so here's the danger of judging something before you get a vindication that god told you it was right see job's three friends jesus looked at everything and they just told job you did this to this you're a sinner but they never got a vindication from god so god sent elijah to rebuke them and then may remember later then they had to sacrifice at the end of the story and repent to god and job because they they tried to figure out the situation without a vindication for god what am i saying i'm saying before you judge somebody's situation pray about it because they didn't pray about it the bible says if you answer a matter before hearing it it's folly and shame unto him so see they really didn't seek god to know they just said well job's had this for months sinner liar and god god stirred up elijah and said these guys are wrong too they're all four of them are wrong right now this is beautiful you know what this reminded me of job reminds me of you and i living in laodicea because we are we not rich and increased with goods but sometimes we're not really hungry for spiritual things and the church said job was rich had all the goods he could wanted and god says you need to be gold you need some gold he said you need some right clothes uh you're naked and then i love this he says your eyes need anointed that you can see your true spiritual condition okay get your bible let's read it let's read job 42 5. get your bible there this is perp this was the great this is one of the great revelations that came this morning job is was like a laodicean he's living in laodicea just like we are job church needed his eyes open he was rich and increased with goods but he needed his eyes open to see his real spiritual condition in other words he could be more of a faithful servant to god look at verse five now remember this is after god rebukes job with 60 plus questions that job cannot answer one of them he's like god has judged me wrong god has judged me wrong and god's like let me ask you 60 questions and can you answer any of them job's like i can't answer anything i'm so smart i wouldn't judge this right uh god laughs at the innocent god said answer me one of these questions job said i can't look at verse five i have heard of thee says he heard about god he knew how to you know fear god brother bang he knew how to he heard about you know making sacrifices i've heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine i see he saw the whirlwind brother amen in other words he saw he saw god come down to the theophany god came down there in the body in the theophany and showed himself and job said i was rich in increase with goods he said but now my eyes are anointed with eyes out now i can see praise god is that beautiful praise god as many as i love everybody said god hates me and god said i love you i'm giving you real eyesight that's my prayer god give me help me to see things the right way in 2021 praise god i know 2020 is like the the the high subscription right our eye prescription right you want 20 20 vision right but my prayer has got to continue to open my eyes i'll say it like that help me to be always able to see clearly the real spiritual things that are happening in my life look at this he's rich increase with goods god brings correction to him and now he says wow now i can see now i've got eye salve on my eyes now i really understand my spiritual state does that help by god's grace i don't know about you but all i see in job is me all i see is the bride of jesus christ in job right we're doing good sometimes and then discouraging we hear all these quotes from brother braham how many of them are we living probably not as many as we'd like to right just speak the word speak the word speak the word well we don't always speak the word sometimes we speak our feelings sometimes we speak our lusts right sometimes we speak our doubts but thank god there's mercy for us church thank god there's mercy thank god there's a god who says come to me he said i'll give you ice out i'll make you see better i'll give you the right clothes i'll give you everything you need just come to me just come to me come to the word my what a beautiful story praise god allah who keeps going i said i will answer also my part i will show mine opinion so all these three men and jobs that all got to tell their opinions now notice god hasn't talked one time in this story since chapter two when god told satan look at job you can you can test him but don't take his life and god still said job's a perfect man well now we go since from chapter 3 all the way to 32 god hasn't said anything god just lets these four men spout out all their ideas some of them are good some of them are bad and eli who says now let me tell you my opinion a perfect type of christ for i am full of the matter the spirit within me constrains me the church there sometimes you're going to get so full of the holy spirit you can't help but say something amen praise god he said behold this one's i'll say my amen behold my belly is as fun remember he preached on a new one god see sometimes you just got righteous in your nation brother man you know exactly what god wants you to say that it don't happen all the time right like i know what happened with my dad this time i know it because god benedict with cam and my dad because he gives every word about the two or three witnesses you see sometimes that spirit of god is just bubbling up in you he said my bellies as wine which have no bet it's ready to burst like new bottles oh my god thank god amen what is new wine it's a fresh it's a word of god amen it's a revelation church there's something you know it's right you've been waiting to say it he sat there and waited all these chapters chapters 4 3 chapter 4 chapter 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 and now finally ready at 32. yeah great job like that birthday song oh darn it are you one are you two are you five are you 40 yes i'm 40. but see all these checkers eli who's sitting there waiting and it's just bubbling up bubbling up like new wine praise god amen hallelujah new eye new revelation praise god just wait for church try not to let it out early because the vibes of the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets you say i'm not a prophet well part of you is the spirit of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy sometimes you'll say things and they'll come to pass some of you know with your dreams you'll see dreams they'll come to pass what is that that's prophecy there's a pro there's a there's an element to our experience that is prophetic right god will show us things to come amen some of these things i saw coming that's happened recently i'll tell you about it more later by god's grace just you know little things but i've seen it i see it coming see it coming so what is a fresh revelation it's like wine and you got gotta let it grow i say wait on it wait on it help me to release it lord at the right time remember church the bible said a gift will make room for itself when it's god's time for you to speak it will open up it'll be plain you'll be ready to say it amen if you're ready to go it'll be the right time because you waited on god and god will orchestrate everything i will speak that i may be refreshed so the wine that comes out of elijah just not only refreshes others it refreshes him praise god see when you speak god's word they get blessed but also you get blessed this is new wine but amen where there's new wine there's new power glory when you speak god's word you get refreshed it feels like everything's brand new again amen that's when it's god's wine not our wine we're not our whining can i say it like that not our wine but god's wine god's word god's revelation i guess i'm just so excited about this because i just saw it with my dad on thursday so and then with cam church on wednesday night where the holy spirit just pours out like that people people are just rejoicing and crying and being blessed so he says i've been waiting this wine has been growing in me and i'm going to get refreshed through this in other words the burden of the holy spirit is going to let be let off me because i've spoken what god wanted me to say i feel like that almost every week i got a burden to preach something and then when i preach i'm like oh thank god thank you jesus and then a couple days later i got another burden i gotta preach right let me not i pray you accept any man's person so he says see now look he's gonna be fair judge jesus is a fair judge jesus doesn't respect anyone above anyone else neither let me give flattering titles unto man oh mr joe great job sir holy father job because i ain't doing any of that stuff for i know not to give flattering titles and so doing my maker would soon take me away out of his presence right out of his blessings when we start exalting men or women above other men or women the bible said god takes you away from his presence right you go leave the holiness of god and you give a you go into a worldly life the spirit of god hath made me i'm sorry the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty has given me life that's jesus right the logos if thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me stand up so look he's even challenged a joke stand up if you can answer me in church if you know the story job never answers elihu so see he couldn't answer because he was wrong look at the holy spirit challenge if you can challenge it stand up and say something against it and job just sits there the whole time because this is christ right and christ is the judge aren't you glad he's the judge of your life and aren't you glad he's your advocate and you're a lawyer as well behold i am oh here it is i am according to thy wish in god's dead see this is where eli who is saying i'm the days man from uh chapter nine that you were looking for praise god she said i'm your answer to your prayer praise god amen see god will answer our prayers let's just hold on to god sometimes god will surprise us by answering a prayer we forget about because we're discouraged backstage but god is going to hear our prayers god will perfect everything that which concerneth you and i am not we're getting fed by the holy spirit this morning praise god i know it praise god with all my heart see i'm god i'm i'm this also foreign i'm this mediator between you and god christ what does eli who mean let me look it up real quick it's got eli that's a good thing that's why i like having this computer here he is my god [Laughter] the the mediators my god jesus christ is my god [Laughter] eli amen ah he is my god that's hebrew my god is my mediator my god is the savior my god is messiah praise god amen oh thank you jesus praise god thank god for that new wine coming for us i was feeling this morning i was telling my wife about that job was like late to see you i had to hold it in for a little bit longer ah thank you jesus now to go to chapter 33 now i want to read portions of these i'd probably preach on this tonight we'll see but i know i got to finish the music series i got to finish the philippians series i got to finish the mystery of israel's buying this series you know you know how that goes i'll get to it eventually by god's grace job 33. people ask me what i've been preaching i'm like well let me remember i got this this this all these different ideas but i hope it's a blessing to you by god's grace 33 verse 8. look what elijah god he is my god look what christ gives forth next verse 8 surely thou spoken in mind hearing and i've heard the voice of thy word saying i am clean without transgression i am innocent neither is there iniquity there it is right there neither is there iniquity in me eli who is he's rewording what job had basically said all those chapters beforehand he's like i'm going to repeat to you joe but you said you said you had no iniquity and eli who's like you do have iniquity not for me if god is for us who can be against us amen praise god we read that on friday night right romans 8 if god is for us who can be against us praise god no matter how small the church is no matter who comes or goes if god is for us who can be dead amen the joke about god's against me i don't have my health anymore god's against me no no sir no no god is for you praise god you're going through something he planned but he will bring you through it and you'll come out a better christian on the other end oh thank the lord amen oh thank you jesus i hope this one is being recorded because i might have to study this one out and write a book about this one later ah look what see this is all jobs got iniquity then right job's really unclean he says he's clean but really he's unclean i thought he was perfect well he is by the blood but his human spirit's not perfect that'll happen later when he gets that new body when he finally gets that new body when he stands with the redeemer on the earth his mind will be perfect once he gets that new body that theophany body and i'll say like this glorified body too amen once you get that glorified body where it can eat again but that theophany will house his human spirit and human soul and he'll no longer think any more evil thoughts oh thank you god i can't wait for that hallelujah thank you jesus when i think no more evil thoughts it's only pure thoughts praise god how i long for that let's read eight through 13. go down to verse 10 10 he says he's god's enemy no no no joke no no god's not against you god's for you verse 11 he put my feet in the stocks and he market all my past in other words god put me in prison god locked me up in prison verse 12 behold in this thou are not just so here now eli who's saying you're not just joke i will answer thee that god is greater than man so what was he saying the whole time i'm greater than god i'm greater he did something wrong see how we're starting to see how what kind of man joe was i do because i move him just like i am and if god still saw him perfect by the blood what is he going to say about you and i praise god amen he did all this brother bang and god still says we're more just than god is no see this is how much god loves you church even in the midst of all your mind battles and all the struggles he doesn't count that against you because he knows your desire is to serve him and he knows you're trusting in his righteousness and not your own job thought he was greater than god verse 13 why does thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matters so look job is fighting against god his words brother man we're fighting against the holy s who told him that jesus who's going to tell you and you're wrong jesus he's going to tell you the things the holy spirit will never be buttered up the holy spirit will always tell you this is what you did wrong that was wrong that was wrong look at verse 14 through 18. for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth a not now look what eli who's telling him this is the chapter about dreams brother god speaks to us many times in dreams and we just forget how many dreams have you forgot this last year i wake up and i always but here joe eli who's going to say god many times speaks twists and dreams with the same dream over and over just forget about it but it's god speaking to us in a dream and a vision of the night when the deep sleep falls upon men and slumbering upon the bed then he openeth the ears of men and sealed their instruction look at that he opens your ears so you can really get the instruction god is trying to get it to you in the end time god's in other words god is trying to help you understand praise god but we've got to be more spirit right at night time we can't be thinking about other things we have to think about god we wake up we can't be thinking about other things we got to be thinking about god he's trying to speak to us in the night that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride from man oh he's trying to get man away from his pride that's what he's doing oh he's trying to get help him to stop being so prideful he's trying to help us not to be so prideful oh why do i need to pray more why do i need to go to more services why do i need to read my bible more he's trying to get us away from pride praise god we want to see miracles we'll have you before right you want to see god saved say people when was the last time we praised somebody to be saved we got to stop being so prideful right you know because whatever you do the most that's what you really want right you spend more time in prayer and you know that shows you really want that that's where your treasures are right we spend more time wasting time i'm not talking about things we have to do i'm talking about things we don't have to do we spend more time wasting time that shows really what we're after yes now look at verse 18 god is keeping back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword so eli who says god is constantly doing this he's trying to protect us he's saving our life many times he's keeping us from dying and he's doing everything he can to try to get us to open up our hearts to receive his instruction amen is that through that verse eighteen okay now nineteen three two through thirty three let me uh i need to find a place to close yeah let's read this because this is prophetic here elijah prophesies to job right in the this beginning part of his speech verse 19 he's chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bones with strong pain so that his life abhorth bread and his soul dainty meat his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen his bones that were not seen stick out yea his soul draweth near into the grave and his life to the destroyers she's talking about men who get sick and get close to dying if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to show on demand his uprightness then now look here it is then god is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom think about how god save bang's life i'm sorry bang's dad's life from going down to the pit praise god this is what eli who's saying we don't even realize it's the god bringing us we do now right but sometimes we don't realize god has spared our lives so many times because he's merciful and the bible said he's gracious so he keeps us from dying he restores our strength like my brother paul he was sick for two weeks he had covet and pneumonia and he didn't he didn't leave off that bed except that you don't use the business he didn't leave off that couch for two whole weeks thought he was gonna die when he finally got up he went to the uh emergency room the game steroids really that's basically nothing i really can't do nothing for you and he has a greater appreciation for god now almost died amen pneumonia kills stop he's the one giving us more chances and more mercy amen and helping teach us to love him more and be more like him then he is gracious i look at verse 25 here's the prophecy here's thus saith the lord brother his flesh shall be fresher than a child right now job's flesh is black and red and purple it's rotting but eli who says god just man like that and then he's gracious and that's what job is going to get in just a chapter just praise god he shall return to the days of his youth did he not brother amen he got all 10 kids back he saw four generations his son's son son praise god we got twice the money back this is god's grace unto you praise god this is how god it's not like i know better than god no god is very gracious god is very kind very patient he wants man to get it he wants man to be victorious he wants man to trust in him so let us go so close to the grave so close to the pit but then raise us up and restore everything to us my dad told me when he had covered for two weeks he said he had to breathe like this in order to make it through the day he said if he did more than that he would choke so my dad laid there for two weeks like this i said dad god brought you up from the pit praise god i said because god is not done with you dad i said there's still people out here you can win to the lord there's still something you can do for jesus christ hey man imagine that sucking on air for two weeks and then now he's up and around i'm giving him hugs i'm lifting him up you know he's all fine now he's still smoking sick back to smoking cigarettes to me that's god's mercy not that he smokes but that god raised him up from the dead almost the dead to give him another chance to me that's amazing grace church and the same thing for your life and my life let me finish this chapter and then we'll be done i preached about an hour and a half today praise the lord feels like 10 minutes to me i preached for two hours on wednesday night and they said it felt like five minutes so see i'm about where i was on wednesday you know just i'm just start feeling good not ready to preach and i'll regret i'll be regretting tomorrow no verse 26 he shall pray unto god and he will be look at he'll be favorable and god will be favorable to the men he will stay with joy for he will render unto man's righteousness he look upon men and if any say i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it prophet me not he would deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light lo all these things work with god often times how much often often god will bring people close to death and then bring them back to give them another chance your dad has had another chance to know god i remember praying that for remember praise that for your dad that he'd have a fourth that maybe four thousand years ago verse 30 to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i will speak ah if thou has anything to say answer me speak for i desire to justify thee if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and i shall teach thee wisdom i stand to our feet praise god musicians if you'll come here there is so much more maybe lord willing we'll get to that tonight here eli who goes on for chapter 32 33 34 35 36 36 6 chapters six the number of man god became man god became flesh jesus christ job is opening up to me like it's never opened up before i used to think joe but the bank actually put joe way up here like
