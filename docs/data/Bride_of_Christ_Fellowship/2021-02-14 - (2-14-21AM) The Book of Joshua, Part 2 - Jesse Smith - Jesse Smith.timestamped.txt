[25:32] if we can serve one another here today
[25:35] and every day praise god so uh lord
[25:38] willing we'll go to uh
[25:39] joshua chapter one i just want to read
[25:42] that first verse
[25:45] and then we'll read the memory verse
[25:46] that my wife had for this month james
[25:49] chapter seven but i started joshua
[25:57] i'm just drawing a lot of strength from
[25:59] joshua i see
[26:01] uh of course the types we looked at last
[26:02] week we'll review them quickly again
[26:04] today but
[26:06] you see the types and i hope you see
[26:08] yourself as a joshua type of person
[26:10] praise god
[26:12] if you don't open by the end of the
[26:13] service you will
[26:15] because he was a warrior and uh today
[26:17] we're gonna look at lord willing unless
[26:19] the holy spirit would somehow direct me
[26:20] otherwise we're gonna look at his life
[26:23] before
[26:24] joshua chapter one so what does his life
[26:26] talk about what do we learn about him in
[26:27] exodus
[26:29] you know that's exodus leviticus numbers
[26:31] and deuteronomy what do we learn about
[26:32] this man
[26:33] in these previous books leading up to
[26:35] what we read in the book of joshua so i
[26:37] like to look at
[26:38] his life here leading up to
[26:41] the time that he took the promised land
[26:43] joshua 1
[26:45] verse 1 not so hard to just you know
[26:48] decide which ones to read
[26:51] let's read that together one two three
[26:54] now
[26:54] after the death of moses the servant of
[26:57] the lord
[26:58] it came to pass that the lord spake unto
[27:01] joshua
[27:02] the son of none moses's minister saying
[27:05] now you know now let's go to james
[27:07] chapter five we'll get to it by god's
[27:18] space
[27:20] 5 7-8 for god righteous upon the tables
[27:23] of our hearts here as we read it
[27:25] let's read it on three one two three be
[27:28] patient therefore
[27:30] brethren unto the coming of the lord
[27:32] behold the husband and waited for the
[27:35] precious fruit of the earth
[27:37] and have long patience for it until he
[27:39] received the early
[27:41] and latter rain be also patient
[27:44] establish your hearts with the coming of
[27:46] the lord
[27:48] amen god bless you may god has blessings
[28:07] look at part two here today by god's
[28:09] grace
[28:11] there's a couple of current events i'd
[28:12] like to share with you eventually i'm
[28:13] just trusting the holy spirit to help me
[28:16] the wind to say it
[28:17] it's got a few things i'm not sure how
[28:19] much you paid attention to
[28:21] for some weeks i pay better attention
[28:22] than others to the news cycle
[28:24] but a couple of things i want to just
[28:26] bring to your attention this week more
[28:27] in the spiritual realm
[28:29] not really politics but more in the
[28:30] spiritual realm
[28:32] just a few things that were really uh
[28:35] shocking this week or
[28:37] uh showing the conditions of the age
[28:41] okay so let's uh that's a picture again
[28:44] of uh
[28:45] the river jordan would have been
[28:47] overflowing like that really heavy
[28:48] waters when joshua took the land
[28:51] uh the holy spirit helped him divide the
[28:53] waters just like it did moses
[28:55] amen as i was with moses he was with
[28:58] joshua as well
[28:59] i hope i can say it like this as god was
[29:01] with brother branham
[29:02] i trust god is with us as well amen
[29:05] thank god
[29:06] i know his word is with us we know his
[29:07] powers with us praise god
[29:10] and i think it's a beautiful type we'll
[29:11] get to this maybe at the end but
[29:13] it's a beautiful type the bible ends the
[29:15] book of deuteronomy by saying
[29:18] moses was a great man and no one was
[29:20] going to reach his status
[29:22] so in other words however great joshua
[29:24] was he was never going to
[29:25] quite reach the attainment of moses
[29:28] would that sound familiar
[29:29] brother brahm had such an anointing he
[29:31] was a star in the hand of god
[29:33] and the bride will never quite reach his
[29:35] level of faith
[29:37] but the thing is we'll still have great
[29:39] escapades of faith praise god amen we'll
[29:41] set up great testimonies to share
[29:43] about the power of god but will never
[29:45] quite reach his revelation
[29:47] or his gifts or his power and so i find
[29:49] a lot of
[29:50] i find a lot of consolation in that fact
[29:53] we'll get to it eventually in
[29:54] deuteronomy 34
[29:55] where god had to tell joshua he said he
[29:58] said you're
[29:58] next he said but but moses my servant
[30:01] there's none like him
[30:03] amen let me say this there's been no
[30:05] preacher in our day like brother branham
[30:07] amen
[30:07] amen but by god's grace we have the same
[30:10] holy spirit with us
[30:11] and god still meets our needs he helps
[30:14] us he strengthens
[30:15] us and we're grateful for the living god
[30:17] among us
[30:18] amen thank god so let's look at part two
[30:21] here today
[30:22] uh by god's grace this is part three
[30:25] now this is part two i just got the
[30:26] wrong date on there that was yeah that
[30:27] was from wednesday i changed my
[30:29] i changed my what i was gonna preach i
[30:31] was gonna save it for this thing so
[30:33] i just want to just say this too i feel
[30:35] like our recent services
[30:36] were divine appointments we've had brian
[30:39] and then we had shang and different ones
[30:41] come and
[30:42] i just felt like they were divine
[30:43] appointments because in both
[30:45] cases i got to talk to each one
[30:47] individually
[30:49] about the word of the lord i don't know
[30:52] about you but i
[30:53] live for those moments well maybe i hope
[30:56] i understand what i'm talking about
[30:58] i live for the moments when i can look
[31:00] somebody in the eye
[31:01] and tell them thus saith the lord from
[31:03] the word of god
[31:05] so with uh with our brother brian or
[31:09] not brother yet our friend brian were
[31:12] able to give him
[31:12] i was able to speak to him exactly thus
[31:15] saith the word of god
[31:16] you need to repent and get right and all
[31:18] these things he said i'm not ready yet i
[31:19] said but
[31:20] i gave my card and said you called me
[31:22] when you're ready i'm still waiting for
[31:23] that call
[31:24] i don't know if it'll come but those are
[31:26] the moment church that we live for
[31:28] last week when shane was here who
[31:29] invited him to church god bless you
[31:31] sister
[31:32] isn't that awesome that you know just
[31:35] isn't it a joy to invite somebody to
[31:36] church
[31:37] i think it's just such a joy to do that
[31:38] don't you and it's such a greater joy
[31:40] when they come
[31:42] right because we invite people and say
[31:44] oh we like got a home church
[31:46] you know but it's very rare that they
[31:48] come nowadays
[31:49] and that's all right but i got to
[31:51] address him after the service after
[31:53] people were filing out i got to address
[31:54] him and tell him
[31:55] i got to tell him thus saith the lord
[31:58] denominations are going to take the mark
[32:00] of the beast and i said thus saith the
[32:02] lord
[32:03] i said you better pray your church leave
[32:04] that denomination or you better get out
[32:06] of that church
[32:08] the church i don't know about you but to
[32:09] me those are the most valuable
[32:11] moments in life where i get to take thus
[32:14] saint the lord from brother branham
[32:16] and i get to share with an individual
[32:18] and you should i don't know if you saw
[32:19] but you should have seen him hug me last
[32:21] sunday
[32:22] i felt like man i don't get too many
[32:23] hugs like this
[32:26] uh and i don't know you know since then
[32:27] what's i don't know i know some things
[32:29] have been said
[32:30] bang was telling me some things were
[32:31] said but uh
[32:33] those are divine appointments because
[32:35] you you know we don't get too many
[32:36] visitors here
[32:38] most churches don't anymore right most
[32:40] people are hiding out because of
[32:41] chronovirus and
[32:42] most people get set in their ways but i
[32:44] just want to tell you i thought it was
[32:46] such
[32:46] a divine appointment and the bible said
[32:48] the spirit and the bride say come that's
[32:50] all we can say has come
[32:52] right but the father told us he said
[32:55] all that the father gives to jesus will
[32:57] come
[32:58] amen we don't know who's going to come
[33:00] but i've got great consolation in my
[33:02] heart
[33:02] now all i've got to do is say come all i
[33:04] got to do
[33:05] is invite them i gave out to my books to
[33:07] one of the workers at our house this
[33:08] week
[33:09] so i'm really happy to be able to
[33:10] witness to him and try to share what god
[33:12] has done
[33:14] and uh so we're just thankful for god's
[33:16] grace and we just want to
[33:18] we want to recognize those divine
[33:20] appointments i did i have a failure in
[33:22] this week yeah i have one
[33:28] although i make a mistake god's not
[33:30] going to leave me amen
[33:31] right because how many mistakes did
[33:33] moses make well we could start counting
[33:34] right here
[33:36] right all these mistakes he made but did
[33:38] god ever leave that man
[33:39] go sir is god going to leave you no sir
[33:42] amen right he said as i was with moses
[33:46] so will i be with you and i said we'll
[33:48] get to eventually one of these sermons
[33:50] we're going to get to if you listen
[33:51] listen to it if you haven't lately
[33:52] from september 11th 1960 as i was with
[33:55] moses brother adam
[33:56] he goes in there and he explains in the
[33:58] message how he has failed god for for
[34:02] sorry for 12 years with his gift of
[34:05] discernment for 12 years he failed god
[34:09] but yet he said i'm ready to leave this
[34:11] desert i'm ready to go forth and take
[34:13] the land
[34:15] and the reason i'll just share with you
[34:17] a little bit before you go to set the
[34:18] reason he failed because because
[34:20] he would he would bring up the patients
[34:22] and let each one of them get a
[34:24] discernment
[34:25] rather than just for praying for all the
[34:27] people slowly he would just stand there
[34:29] he'd wait there
[34:30] until the gift operated and brother
[34:32] branham said how cruel that
[34:34] was when people out in the audience
[34:35] needed brother graham to pray for them
[34:37] as well
[34:39] he said he would pray for six or eight
[34:40] he would lose all of his energy
[34:42] and then he couldn't pray for the rest
[34:44] of him brother graham said that was so
[34:46] he said
[34:47] how cruel look it up if you got the app
[34:49] look up how cool
[34:50] program says i failed god he said but
[34:52] i'm ready to go forward
[34:54] so he said no matter how many come
[34:55] through he said i'll just pray for them
[34:57] briefly
[34:57] he said there'll still be some
[34:58] discernments but i'm not going to let
[35:00] them just stand there and pull
[35:02] the sermons out while everybody else
[35:03] doesn't get prayed for he was going to
[35:05] make sure he prayed for all the people
[35:07] amen now talk about that talk about
[35:10] admitting
[35:11] talking about being humble to admit that
[35:13] you failed god with your gift
[35:15] the church of god never left them after
[35:17] that if god so honored many of his
[35:19] prayers
[35:19] what about you and i god is still with
[35:21] us amen
[35:22] hallelujah this is that whatever you
[35:24] haven't done this week we've done it
[35:26] lately as i was with moses
[35:27] i was just i listened to it again this
[35:29] week over and over well what a great
[35:31] message that is
[35:32] wouldn't encourage me to know that
[35:33] though we fail though we make mistakes
[35:35] god will never leave us he'll never
[35:37] forsake us praise god
[35:39] amen now so let's briefly review these
[35:41] four applications i promise i'll go
[35:43] briefly here
[35:44] unless the holy spirit does something
[35:46] the first one is you and i
[35:48] crossing joy represents our new birth
[35:50] our third work of grace being
[35:52] born again for every individual that's
[35:55] why i was saying
[35:57] we should have some part of us that
[35:58] feels like wow i feel like joshua
[36:00] i feel like god has just parted
[36:02] everything out of my life
[36:04] and i'm able to go into the baptism of
[36:06] the holy ghost
[36:08] god has done this god has stood up every
[36:10] obstacle praise god god
[36:12] has made every obstacle stand up so i
[36:14] can possess
[36:15] my inheritance amen so we should have
[36:18] this
[36:19] this idea this feeling like wow we're
[36:22] like joshua's generation
[36:24] we're going into the land praise god and
[36:26] we're the ones possessing the land amen
[36:30] now the second and now oh yeah i want to
[36:31] add this in here too
[36:33] we read this last week but i kind of
[36:34] went over it quickly
[36:36] hebrews 4 8 says for jesus had given
[36:39] them
[36:40] rest then he would not afterward have
[36:42] spoken of another day
[36:44] in other words if joshua really gave
[36:47] israel rest
[36:48] then why did david speak of another rest
[36:51] right because david was about 500 years
[36:54] after
[36:55] after joshua if if finally god was going
[36:58] to give them rest through joshua
[37:00] and they're in the land and there they
[37:02] have a sabbath every saturday
[37:03] they don't work every saturday if that
[37:05] was the rest then why would david
[37:08] 500 years promise another rest amen
[37:12] he said there remained therefore a rest
[37:15] to the people of god
[37:17] so the other day was david speaking of
[37:20] rest
[37:21] that came as a result of jesus's
[37:24] resurrection
[37:25] amen because 500 years the holy spirit
[37:28] anointed david to say that therefore my
[37:30] heart is glad
[37:31] and my glory rejoices my flesh shall
[37:34] also rest
[37:36] in hope david david was born in the
[37:39] promised land amen
[37:41] he died in the promised land he lived
[37:42] every day of his life almost i don't
[37:44] know
[37:45] he spent most of his life in the
[37:47] promised land but he said
[37:48] i still know there's another rest amen
[37:52] he said my for thou will not leave my
[37:54] soul in hell
[37:55] neither will thou suffer thy holy one to
[37:57] see corruption
[37:58] now you bible readers know acts chapter
[38:01] 2
[38:01] peter quotes this and he's talking about
[38:05] jesus for david's feet concerning jesus
[38:08] right i foresaw the lord always before
[38:11] my face for he's on my right hand that i
[38:13] should not be moved
[38:14] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[38:16] tongue was glad moreover also my flesh
[38:19] shall rest in hope he said but because i
[38:22] will not
[38:23] leave my soul in hell neither will thou
[38:25] suffer thy holy one
[38:27] to see corruption amen amen
[38:30] so the hebrew writer recognizes that
[38:33] david was looking for rest
[38:35] 500 years after joshua supposedly gave
[38:38] them wrath
[38:38] amen so the rest he was talking about
[38:41] was the rest in your soul
[38:43] the rest from trying to earn salvation
[38:45] and working at yourself
[38:46] and the rest in knowing that god has
[38:48] given you salvation
[38:50] and god by the holy ghost in you is
[38:52] working in you amen amen it is not i
[38:55] that liveth
[38:56] but christ that liveth in me amen amen
[38:59] oh that's glorious there's another one
[39:01] too he says david says it on multiple
[39:03] occasions
[39:04] it said oh that i had wings like a dove
[39:06] for then i would fly away and be at rest
[39:08] why would david need to fly away and be
[39:10] at rest
[39:11] if the saturday sabbath was the rest or
[39:14] if living in canaan was the rest why
[39:16] would he
[39:16] seek to desire rest because there was a
[39:19] greater rest amen
[39:21] go low then when i wander off and remain
[39:24] in the wilderness
[39:24] sea loud so we know that david was
[39:28] speaking
[39:29] of another rest there's something
[39:30] greater that he was pressing toward amen
[39:33] it was greater than possessing a certain
[39:35] property it was greater
[39:37] uh than just passing through jordan it
[39:40] was greater than not working on saturday
[39:42] or sunday praise god
[39:45] it was the it was the blessing of never
[39:47] working again
[39:48] amen being at rest in god's promises
[39:51] amen
[39:52] amen in your soul praise god
[39:57] the second application was brother adam
[39:59] was entering his
[40:00] third poll because we know he was
[40:03] already born again
[40:06] the third application was brother adam
[40:08] was like joshua
[40:09] and we are like caleb seems like the
[40:11] third whole type i mentioned that last
[40:13] week with
[40:14] recent healing in the church
[40:17] healings rather like a third poll type
[40:20] of ministry moving into the spoken word
[40:23] praise god
[40:24] now i want to now here's where i'll do
[40:26] some more i will do some fresh quotes on
[40:27] this
[40:28] the fourth application was brother
[40:30] brandon was like moses
[40:33] and the holy ghost today is like
[40:37] i joshua i got these a little bit out of
[40:38] order here so forgive me let's redo this
[40:40] again you remember this
[40:41] uh the spiritual joshua takes what moses
[40:43] the prophet said acts on it
[40:45] joshua didn't sit around and quote moses
[40:47] all day and said he had his own
[40:49] relationship with god
[40:50] and fought as a warrior possessing the
[40:52] land through god's power
[40:54] amen now this is uh here's some new
[40:57] quotes now here's a new
[40:59] uh a new application well i should say
[41:01] it's a similar application that i
[41:02] preached last week
[41:04] i was listening to this message about
[41:05] three times this week
[41:07] the great warrior joshua now look at
[41:09] this type this is a beautiful type
[41:11] moses a type of the church organization
[41:16] who brought the law and so forth failed
[41:19] now why did he fail glorifying himself
[41:23] in the stead of god now look at this
[41:25] type what a beautiful type
[41:28] oh my it's so powerful did you ever see
[41:30] that jose
[41:33] brother said moses was like the
[41:36] church or the nominations of his day
[41:38] they
[41:39] they were they were powerful for a while
[41:41] but they ended up
[41:42] glorifying themselves so god had to
[41:44] raise up with joshua
[41:46] brother branham amen hallelujah praise
[41:50] god
[41:52] is that right he says he said so is the
[41:55] church today
[41:55] trying to see who can build the biggest
[41:57] church that's why we're not interested
[41:59] in anything in the natural churches
[42:01] praise god
[42:02] right we don't get interested in that
[42:04] that's a church or that's a man trying
[42:05] to glorify themselves
[42:07] who can get the best dressed select or
[42:09] crowd who can get the mayor of the city
[42:10] and all the celebrity in the church
[42:12] that's what the program is today as the
[42:13] baptist said a million more
[42:15] and 44. i don't care a million more of
[42:17] what that's it right there
[42:20] yeah when you get a bigger church what
[42:21] are you getting are you getting more
[42:23] uh denominational people are getting
[42:25] more people filled with the holy ghost
[42:27] we want souls that are born again amen
[42:30] except they're born again they'll stay
[42:31] on fire
[42:33] they might have a few a few hard seasons
[42:36] but they'll stay on fire
[42:37] because they're constantly guiding some
[42:39] more truth amen
[42:41] oh i'm tired of seeing people in and out
[42:43] and sometimes
[42:44] on fire sometimes not he want everybody
[42:47] on fire praise god
[42:49] amen hallelujah i've been on fire for
[42:53] all these years my goodness
[42:54] that's what we expect everybody if they
[42:56] say they're born again then stay on fire
[42:58] amen amen
[42:59] prove it by your life stay dedicated
[43:01] with god chop out every sin out of your
[43:03] life
[43:04] and say pure before god almighty amen
[43:06] amen
[43:07] i know there's a time too i was telling
[43:08] this is my wife sometimes i feel like
[43:11] the bible says hezekiah the bible said
[43:13] god left hezekiah for a season to test
[43:16] him
[43:17] so sometimes the anointing may not seem
[43:19] as as as strong on you
[43:21] how many can ever how many could say man
[43:22] that kind of relate to that there are
[43:24] some seasons where may the anointing you
[43:26] might do the same thing
[43:27] you might pray and read your bible as
[43:29] much or more
[43:31] but it doesn't seem like that anointing
[43:33] comes faster that's okay god's just
[43:35] pulling off his anointing
[43:36] to test you because he's got to do that
[43:39] to everybody
[43:40] he's got to test them to see uh if if
[43:43] they lose that feeling a little bit of
[43:44] that feeling
[43:45] they still stay devoted to me and it's a
[43:47] good thing god does that too
[43:50] because then you may just you just be
[43:52] addicted to feelings
[43:53] rather than the word damn
[43:56] i didn't hear you right god left him for
[43:59] a season
[44:00] god left hezekiah for a season and
[44:02] remember church he failed that one
[44:04] he failed right after god healed him of
[44:07] his death near death disease
[44:10] instead of getting stronger he got more
[44:12] loose hezekiah got more loose
[44:14] and he invited those ambassadors from
[44:16] bound lines you can look at all god's
[44:18] stretchers
[44:19] you can look at all these things but
[44:20] what the bible say don't cast your
[44:22] pearls before slime
[44:25] he got too loose with the treasures of
[44:27] god
[44:29] and we know what happened uh he just had
[44:31] an awful end to his life
[44:33] hezekiah so i just want to encourage you
[44:36] just stay stay devoted to god you're
[44:38] gonna learn that from joshua today
[44:40] just stay devoted let me say this stay
[44:42] on your knees
[44:43] stay in the word stay in church stay
[44:46] praising god
[44:47] keep god at the forefront of your life
[44:49] and god will reward you
[44:51] but it'll really prove if you're born
[44:53] again or not amen that's what it's for
[44:55] because that's what we see in our day
[44:57] many say they are he said you might have
[45:00] more see that's what
[45:01] it doesn't matter how many people are in
[45:03] the church our church or any church
[45:05] it doesn't matter how many are there it
[45:07] matters how many of them are born again
[45:10] oh that's encouraging amen i'd rather
[45:12] have one
[45:13] one filled with the holy ghost one of
[45:15] god's power
[45:16] than a thousand
[45:30] well we'll see what this time brother
[45:31] adam can represent joshua
[45:33] like he said in the pick up your pen and
[45:35] right experience
[45:37] denominations could not take the church
[45:39] into the promised land
[45:40] the baptism of the holy ghost that's
[45:43] proof because i can look at my
[45:45] my family i can look at the church i was
[45:46] raised in they never took us in the
[45:48] promised land
[45:49] it took god calling us out of the
[45:51] denomination so simon could get born
[45:53] again
[45:53] cam can get born again i could get born
[45:56] again betsy could get bored again
[45:58] god had to call us out of that
[45:59] denomination because the denomination is
[46:01] no longer
[46:02] the mouthpiece of god but we're blessed
[46:05] because god is speaking to
[46:06] us the spirit and the bride saying come
[46:09] amen
[46:10] hallelujah you won't find the the
[46:13] denominations as the mouthpiece of god
[46:15] but you'll find it here if we're
[46:17] obedient to the word of the lord
[46:20] amen
[46:23] i just didn't expect all this boldness
[46:24] here so bear with me here i didn't
[46:26] expect this
[46:27] it's not how many we can get to the
[46:29] church it's how many we can get in
[46:31] christ
[46:33] to believe and submit themselves find
[46:35] their position
[46:36] and stand like the rock of ages at their
[46:39] post of duty and ready ready for what
[46:41] the rapture praise god amen
[46:43] and ready for any gift any supernatural
[46:46] move
[46:46] just be ready there so god can use you
[46:50] well i hope god just settles everybody
[46:52] in here tonight
[46:53] and just you or let you know what to do
[46:55] the great crisis we're at cadence barney
[46:57] look at this he said we're at katy's
[46:58] barnett
[46:59] in 1955 the churches couldn't go over in
[47:02] the holy ghost so god had to send a
[47:04] prophet to take him over
[47:06] amen that old now that old ministry was
[47:08] effective right it was effective and
[47:10] it's day
[47:11] brother said god used to use seminaries
[47:14] in church i tell you if you haven't
[47:16] studied church history study it
[47:18] i forget was it martin no it was
[47:20] iranians
[47:21] iranians built schools and seminaries
[47:25] and he taught all these men and one of
[47:27] those men that came out was
[47:28] martin his nephew and martin cast out
[47:31] devils heal the sick and iron and that
[47:33] man was a
[47:34] mighty man of god amen so schools can be
[47:37] good
[47:38] for a while but then they became places
[47:40] of stagnation
[47:42] when they denominated they got the man's
[47:45] idea
[47:45] they became the bible said tables full
[47:48] of vomit
[47:48] and god had to move out of there praise
[47:50] god but for a while
[47:52] god used them but then god draw the
[47:54] people out of there
[47:55] because it was a dead system praise god
[47:59] now he says we're at cadence barnea
[48:02] and he says there's now this is skipping
[48:04] ahead now in
[48:05] five years later there's a lot of great
[48:07] types in here but we'll bypass some of
[48:09] them for instance
[48:10] moses was the church age that brought
[48:12] them to sinai
[48:14] to their theology of last night
[48:17] and for some reason they don't have they
[48:19] don't have september 10th message so
[48:21] they just have september
[48:22] 11th i went and looked so they must have
[48:24] lost that recording so now i don't know
[48:25] how that happened
[48:26] he said moses was not permitted to take
[48:28] the children of israel over the promised
[48:30] land
[48:30] because he had failed so this would mean
[48:32] that philadelphian age was the anti-type
[48:35] of moses
[48:36] which it was a great open door was it
[48:38] not that was the age of the open door
[48:41] where missionaries like william carey
[48:43] went to india and won millions of souls
[48:46] david livingston went uh all through
[48:48] africa preaching the gospel they just
[48:50] had all these open doors amen jesus said
[48:53] i've
[48:54] opened the door for you philadelphia
[48:56] brotherly love
[48:57] ah brotherly love drove them to the to
[49:00] be missionaries brotherly love will
[49:02] drive us to witness to our friends and
[49:04] our neighbors amen
[49:06] oh brother we'll do it praise god
[49:10] so philadelphia brotherhood typed moses
[49:14] but then god in the next age god had to
[49:17] send a messenger
[49:18] a prophet to take them in to the
[49:21] promised land amen
[49:23] oh thank the lord and the church
[49:26] organization's denomination has
[49:28] failed they'll not take the church over
[49:30] god will raise up a new system an
[49:32] inner denominational system by the power
[49:34] of god that'll take the church into the
[49:36] promised land
[49:37] organizations the denomination that's
[49:39] messing up
[49:40] each one after their own theology each
[49:42] one after their own way of thinking but
[49:44] god will take his holy spirit
[49:46] and will raise his joshua that will take
[49:48] the church to the promise
[49:49] with no denominational strings tied
[49:51] anywhere but will take
[49:53] his church over moses had failed
[49:56] he was the lawgiver joshua was called of
[50:00] grace
[50:01] and he took the church on
[50:04] praise god isn't that beautiful i just
[50:07] love that
[50:09] now here before i go on here let me this
[50:11] maybe this would be an appropriate time
[50:14] let me go through some news here real
[50:15] quick
[50:19] this week was just a a stirring week of
[50:22] a couple of events now
[50:24] i'm not going to say the man's name
[50:25] because you can see it on the screen but
[50:27] this man uh passed away last summer in
[50:30] the uh summer may 2020.
[50:33] i'm pretty sure if you ever heard of
[50:34] this preacher
[50:36] he was an apologist which means he was
[50:38] he would argue and
[50:40] uh so he would argue christian arguments
[50:42] about uh you know
[50:43] major questions like why do people
[50:45] suffer and everything like this
[50:47] i don't know if you saw it this week but
[50:48] this week or last week uh
[50:50] after the man passed away uh then his
[50:53] ministry investigated all his cell
[50:55] phones that he had
[50:57] and uh and they interviewed all the
[50:59] people around him and this man
[51:01] this ministry to this man who he was
[51:03] just an intellectual man
[51:04] right no miracles in his ministry just
[51:06] intellectual trying to argue and reason
[51:08] christianity from
[51:10] a human logical standpoint
[51:14] now well i'm missing a few of them and a
[51:16] few of them i thought that's pretty good
[51:18] and a few of them i'm not like i said i
[51:19] don't even know what this guy is saying
[51:21] and so intellectual i can't even
[51:22] understand what he's saying what came
[51:24] out this week after the investigations
[51:26] that went through
[51:27] that this man had so many uh immoral
[51:30] sexual relationships around the world
[51:33] 24 million dollars pouring in a year
[51:36] into his ministry
[51:37] when he died people called him uh
[51:40] like a next billy graham but this week
[51:43] it's coming out
[51:44] that that all this money corrupted his
[51:47] life
[51:48] he would uh he he owned massage
[51:52] uh what do they call massage
[51:55] spouse he owned numerous of them that's
[51:58] where he would go
[51:59] to do evil acts i'm just going to kind
[52:01] of leave it like that
[52:02] and everybody looked at him as this
[52:04] mighty intellectual person he was so
[52:06] snarted
[52:06] and so many people accredited him with
[52:09] you know helping them understand life's
[52:10] questions
[52:11] that may be true
[52:14] but as they've examined his life he
[52:17] chose to live in
[52:18] iniquity can i say like this his life
[52:21] looks like a judas iscariot life i'm not
[52:23] saying it was
[52:24] but it looks like it because years and
[52:27] years of records and phone calls
[52:30] and texts with numerous women and numero
[52:32] all around the world
[52:34] he would go to thailand and different
[52:36] places and go there to write a book but
[52:38] yet
[52:38] engage in all kinds of immorality
[52:42] church i'm thankful for one thing i'm
[52:44] thankful for the power of the holy
[52:45] spirit praise god amen
[52:47] amen the power that will drive a man
[52:50] to crucify the lust of the flesh and the
[52:53] affections thereof amen
[52:56] see if you just have an intellectual
[52:57] faith that's why these people are far
[52:59] away from the message
[53:00] because they never got genuine faith in
[53:02] their soul and if they did they never
[53:03] let it grow
[53:05] right and we've gotta let these
[53:09] uh we gotta let the word of god grow in
[53:10] our lives to the holiness pushes out
[53:14] all the worldliness praise god amen
[53:17] and the fruits of the spirit are
[53:19] contrary to the things of the flesh
[53:21] so we see that these preachers live many
[53:25] will live
[53:25] lives of luxuriousness with millions of
[53:28] dollars
[53:28] i said god keep me from that keep me
[53:31] humble praise god
[53:32] keep me living a life of integrity
[53:34] praise god
[53:36] so this came out this week he was
[53:39] married the whole time but yet had all
[53:40] he had two daughters and all these
[53:42] things but he had all these other women
[53:43] on all
[53:44] i think he had like eight cell phones
[53:46] now over the years
[53:48] so he can keep his his lives straight
[53:50] now church that to me looks like a
[53:52] worker iniquity
[53:53] now i don't know i don't know what jesus
[53:55] will say but it looks like he might say
[53:57] something like this
[53:58] you might have done great things
[53:59] supposedly but did i ever know you
[54:01] that's the question could someone really
[54:04] know jesus can jesus really know them
[54:06] if they're doing the will of flesh
[54:08] instead of the will of god amen
[54:11] supposedly help so many people
[54:14] but then hurt so many in the process
[54:18] so see this is an example of how the
[54:20] holy spirit i love bill branson's
[54:22] example praise god they would offer him
[54:24] millions and he turned it down
[54:27] i heard it on tape it's actually on that
[54:28] tape uh it's that as i was with moses
[54:30] brother rams said the latter rain
[54:32] movement that moved up to canada
[54:34] and now it had millions of dollars for
[54:36] years they came to brother graham and he
[54:38] said
[54:38] they tried they said that he said they
[54:40] said let's build a memorial for you
[54:43] and let's start a denomination and
[54:46] brother
[54:46] said i'm not looking for a memorial i'm
[54:49] looking for the coming of the lord amen
[54:54] and that move went up into evil things
[54:56] like abuse as well and all kinds of
[54:58] false prophecies
[55:00] look at that look at a man he's offered
[55:03] that these men try to offer we'll make a
[55:05] denomination just for your name
[55:08] we'll make it you know we'll make it
[55:09] right after you but god will give him
[55:12] the power of the holy spirit
[55:13] to turn that down and say i'm not
[55:15] looking for that
[55:16] i'm looking for jesus christ amen
[55:20] today praise god that we won't sell out
[55:23] for anything
[55:24] we'll just keep the humble simple gospel
[55:27] message
[55:27] we'll preach it and we'll live it praise
[55:29] god
[55:32] amazing
[55:37] now the second one i'll get to here i
[55:40] don't know if you saw it
[55:41] i used to be big into sports that's why
[55:42] i'm sharing this one i don't watch
[55:44] any sporting event i haven't watched a
[55:46] sporting event well other than my
[55:47] brother's football games
[55:48] live my brother's one brother
[55:51] my brother-in-law that was back in 2006
[55:55] i think
[55:57] on tv i haven't watched the game since
[55:59] uh 2002 the national championship when
[56:02] ohio state beat florida that was the
[56:04] last game i watched i felt condemned the
[56:06] whole time
[56:06] because i already knew the message at
[56:08] that point but all these people that can
[56:10] watch the games and
[56:11] think they're right with god i think
[56:12] they're bachelor that's my opinion
[56:14] anyways i don't know did you see this
[56:15] week they interviewed
[56:18] the quarterback that won the super bowl
[56:20] before he won the super bowl so i'm
[56:22] gonna try not to use that
[56:23] and they asked him how do you keep doing
[56:25] this and he said i've married a witch
[56:27] but she's a good witch did you see the
[56:30] pepperoni
[56:32] and i think about all the people the
[56:33] message i know numerous people the
[56:34] message in churches
[56:35] that watch the super bowl and it's
[56:39] already been proven
[56:40] every performer at halftime is a
[56:42] satanist
[56:44] it's already been proven i can show to
[56:45] you if you want i'll send you a link
[56:48] every one of those musicians from
[56:49] michael jackson all beyonce
[56:51] bruno mars and this one was some person
[56:54] called the weeknd
[56:55] they're all satanists you can prove it
[56:58] they say it their lyrics they say in
[57:00] their personal life all of them even
[57:02] katy perry they've all come out and said
[57:03] i've sold my soul to the devil see
[57:06] they're marked oh
[57:07] they got the mark of the beast but we
[57:09] got to seal the holy ghost praise god
[57:11] amen
[57:12] and yet churches that say we got the
[57:14] seal they go to that for pleasure now
[57:16] let me tell you they're facts
[57:18] they're not born again they'll go watch
[57:21] satan's now not just the musician well i
[57:23] don't watch the halftime show
[57:25] well now the winning quarterback is
[57:27] married to which and they he said where
[57:28] my wife's involved in witchcraft uh we
[57:31] didn't say which guy he said but my wife
[57:32] gives me these stones for healing
[57:34] and she has me set up an altar at my
[57:37] locker every time before the game
[57:39] and and uh says all these mantras before
[57:42] the games i just kind of want to shock
[57:43] you a little bit
[57:45] and i want to encourage you that we are
[57:47] in the right over here praise god
[57:49] we are in the right we're in the holy
[57:51] ghost shutting these things
[57:52] let us not be let's not compare
[57:54] ourselves to message churches
[57:56] let's be like the early church praise
[57:58] god
[57:59] that shunned evil and shunned all these
[58:01] things and lived
[58:02] separated unto god like he said separate
[58:05] me paul barnabas
[58:06] for the work that i've called them to do
[58:08] praise god amen
[58:10] that about blew my eyes out of my
[58:12] sockets this week
[58:14] nice to like that guy i used to like
[58:15] that team i used to be my team before he
[58:17] was there
[58:19] i used to like drew bleds i don't know
[58:20] if some of you know that but that used
[58:22] to be my favorite guy when i was in high
[58:23] school
[58:24] well then this new guy come and he
[58:26] married a witch
[58:27] and he admits it i can share the link if
[58:29] you want
[58:31] it was interesting too because they were
[58:33] trying to they were speculating these
[58:34] preachers were trying to speculate
[58:36] is that why all those guys got hurt on
[58:37] the other team because they put curses
[58:38] on them
[58:40] and that's how they won the game i don't
[58:41] know but one thing we know
[58:44] is that demons are behind them demons
[58:47] are taking more control
[58:48] demons are gathering their groups
[58:51] together politically
[58:52] athletically financially the demons are
[58:55] gathering the tares together
[58:57] but christ is bringing forth the wheat
[58:59] into his garner
[59:01] hallelujah he's matured
[59:08] thank god those are the two things i
[59:11] thought i'd share with you that with
[59:12] this movie
[59:13] striking to me this week
[59:17] i'm glad what i'm saying is i'm glad god
[59:19] called me out because i would have been
[59:20] all into that
[59:21] that was my bread and butter in life you
[59:24] know
[59:25] so i'm very thankful for god's grace
[59:27] blessings you know i used to like
[59:28] intellectual preaching a little bit you
[59:29] know before the message came to me
[59:31] so i can see how i can see church how
[59:33] god is protecting me from all these
[59:35] things
[59:37] i i uh i can tell how
[59:40] he's hiding me under the shadow of his
[59:42] wings
[59:44] hallelujah
[59:47] he said how often he would have gathered
[59:48] you and hovered you onto yourself
[59:50] see that's what they rejected it but
[59:52] we've received it
[59:54] we're gathered under jehovah's mighty
[59:56] wings and we're resting under the old
[59:58] and new testament praise god
[1:00:00] amen thank god all right let's look at
[1:00:02] joshua for a few minutes here
[1:00:08] verse one now after the death of moses
[1:00:10] the servant of the lord
[1:00:12] it came to pass that the lord spake unto
[1:00:13] joshua the son of none
[1:00:15] moses is minister saying so minister
[1:00:18] is a servant so this
[1:00:22] really struck out to me brother adam
[1:00:23] calls uh joshua the great
[1:00:25] warrior and he was amen but before he
[1:00:28] was a warrior
[1:00:29] he was a servant before you'll be a
[1:00:32] mighty prayer warrior
[1:00:34] before you'll be a a warrior in the
[1:00:36] prayer lines or
[1:00:37] whatever god's called you to be before
[1:00:39] that you and i
[1:00:41] have got to be servants first
[1:00:44] i just read it this week where jesus
[1:00:45] said i didn't come to be served
[1:00:48] i came to serve and to give my life
[1:00:51] as a ransom for many amen and he said
[1:00:54] the greatest among you
[1:00:56] will be the servants amen amen those
[1:00:59] that are serving other people
[1:01:01] those that want to help other people and
[1:01:03] just be a blessing to other people
[1:01:06] the servants are the greatest among us
[1:01:08] so god help us to be servants praise god
[1:01:11] it's a beautiful picture and i
[1:01:14] again i'm going to say this about
[1:01:16] brother abraham that they criticized
[1:01:17] brother
[1:01:18] they criticized brother graham he can't
[1:01:20] remember all the things about the seven
[1:01:21] major visions and maybe i'll preach this
[1:01:23] on wednesday i've been going through the
[1:01:24] seven major revisions it's my next
[1:01:25] youtube video they criticized brother
[1:01:29] you know he changed this and said this
[1:01:31] about the seven major visions
[1:01:32] and church i think i've said this before
[1:01:34] brother branham was not a pampered
[1:01:36] scholar
[1:01:37] a pampered uh computer technician like
[1:01:40] so many men are today
[1:01:42] program didn't have the luxury to sit
[1:01:44] behind a desk all day like people today
[1:01:46] and just click click click and that's
[1:01:47] their job he was out there praying for
[1:01:49] the city he was making sick calls
[1:01:51] he was out there resting and praying all
[1:01:53] day so he could preach to the
[1:01:54] congregations
[1:01:56] he was a man that was laboring he poured
[1:01:59] every ounce of his heart and soul to
[1:02:01] pray for the sick
[1:02:02] and these people criticized him for not
[1:02:04] being able to remember some details
[1:02:05] about
[1:02:06] things that took place 20 30 years ago
[1:02:09] yeah may god have mercy on these people
[1:02:13] he lived most of his life in visions
[1:02:17] let me ask you this what what's the oh
[1:02:19] what's the first dream you remember
[1:02:21] or what's the second dream you remember
[1:02:24] anybody tell me
[1:02:25] all right sorry i shouldn't say that out
[1:02:26] loud why don't you tell me out loud
[1:02:28] but do you think i'll just say like this
[1:02:30] rhetorical question
[1:02:31] do you think you can tell me more
[1:02:33] details about the dreams you had
[1:02:35] 20 30 years ago or less
[1:02:39] probably less right and they'll
[1:02:41] criticize brother well he said this
[1:02:42] about fdr
[1:02:43] and then he said this about stalin and
[1:02:46] he said this and
[1:02:47] it wasn't exactly the same and these men
[1:02:50] know nothing about prophecy they never
[1:02:53] said they never even prayed for a sick
[1:02:54] person brother johnny
[1:02:57] they never even seen a miracle in their
[1:02:58] lives really
[1:03:00] they never even really spoke with thus
[1:03:02] the lord many of them have never even
[1:03:04] preached one sermon or got behind the
[1:03:06] anointing
[1:03:06] or or who knows they've never hold week
[1:03:10] long services and revivals like he
[1:03:12] studied and fasted and prayed for eight
[1:03:13] days in a row for the seven seals
[1:03:15] they've never done that and they're
[1:03:17] criticizing god's spirit
[1:03:18] i i say let's encourage god's servants
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:25] what are they they're just spirits of
[1:03:27] criticism they're critical spirits
[1:03:29] praise god
[1:03:30] you think in those old honky tonk
[1:03:32] kentucky hills can i it's a honky tonk
[1:03:34] okay
[1:03:35] and those are maybe it's not a good word
[1:03:36] to say you think in those old kentucky
[1:03:38] hills
[1:03:39] they had scholars that were waiting in
[1:03:40] 1933 when brother around they had
[1:03:42] scholars waiting they're all educated
[1:03:44] brother man was a seventh grade educated
[1:03:46] man
[1:03:47] do you think he had scholars waiting
[1:03:48] there to record they didn't have
[1:03:50] recorders they could afford that
[1:03:53] and he's trying his best to remember
[1:03:56] by the holy spirit the bill graham said
[1:03:59] you think you sweat it out
[1:04:00] he said i swear it out way more than you
[1:04:02] swear to that
[1:04:03] god makes them wait for thus saith the
[1:04:05] lord god makes them wait for this
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:10] i'm standing with joshua praise god amen
[1:04:13] i'm saying with joshua hallelujah
[1:04:17] a minister a servant
[1:04:20] now who knows the first mention of
[1:04:22] joshua
[1:04:24] they just left egypt and they're out in
[1:04:27] the wilderness
[1:04:29] and all of a sudden these amalekites
[1:04:31] come up
[1:04:32] the first battle after the tokens
[1:04:35] applied
[1:04:39] they applied the yeah and they left
[1:04:41] egypt
[1:04:42] and the very first thing that comes up
[1:04:46] they all looked at moses most we got the
[1:04:48] amla kites on the way
[1:04:50] the first mention moses says joshua
[1:04:54] get ready you go choose some warriors
[1:04:58] we're going to battle tomorrow
[1:05:01] because now if somebody asked you to
[1:05:02] lead an army brother johnny how long
[1:05:04] would you want to prepare
[1:05:05] well even how long would you want to
[1:05:07] prepare to go find a battle today
[1:05:09] well we're going to go uh we're going to
[1:05:11] go up and we're going to invade canada
[1:05:13] how many days would you like how many
[1:05:15] years would you like to do this
[1:05:19] but moses says tomorrow joshua hit some
[1:05:21] men we're going to go
[1:05:22] we're going to go to defeat avalyn oh
[1:05:24] sure boss that sounds good yeah
[1:05:28] most of us church if we're honest we
[1:05:30] want to be ready to do that
[1:05:32] but the first mention we see is joshua
[1:05:36] he's asked to quickly assemble an army
[1:05:39] overnight
[1:05:40] i have a hard enough time assembling a
[1:05:42] sermon overnight
[1:05:44] let alone i guess it is a battle but
[1:05:47] not really like the same natural battle
[1:05:49] he said and lead him
[1:05:51] so he was a warrior strong confident in
[1:05:53] god so moses
[1:05:54] had already recognized in just a few
[1:05:56] weeks after
[1:05:57] maybe it was in egypt too maybe moses
[1:05:59] was watching joshua he's a mighty man
[1:06:01] i like he's a strong man he's a brave
[1:06:03] man he has the leading of the lord amen
[1:06:06] i can see the holy spirit that's all me
[1:06:08] it's cut on him too praise god
[1:06:09] and somehow after they leave these 2
[1:06:11] million people out and their first
[1:06:13] battle comes
[1:06:14] moses says i'm going to choose joshua
[1:06:19] jehovah is salvation good choice moses
[1:06:22] jehovah is our salvation having said
[1:06:25] he's still our salvation today praise
[1:06:27] god
[1:06:27] he's still your salvation today it will
[1:06:29] be your salvation this week
[1:06:31] he will deliver you joshua's with you
[1:06:33] praise god
[1:06:35] he's with you in the capture
[1:06:38] he was there the whole time sitting
[1:06:40] there in the camp and he's just waiting
[1:06:41] to be called on but he was a servant
[1:06:43] first
[1:06:44] a servant first and then god called him
[1:06:49] well now you become the leader of the
[1:06:52] army
[1:06:53] you were a servant now i'm raising you
[1:06:55] up to general
[1:06:57] well how can i do this moses notice he
[1:06:59] doesn't know look what the scripture
[1:07:00] says
[1:07:01] then came amalek and followed israel and
[1:07:04] refered him and moses said choose out
[1:07:06] amen and go out and fight with amla
[1:07:08] tomorrow i will stand on top of the hill
[1:07:10] with the rod of god in my hand
[1:07:14] i'm gonna stand up there you go fine i'm
[1:07:16] gonna stand up there on the hill
[1:07:17] and i'm gonna hold the ride of god oh i
[1:07:19] imagine joshua said amen moses
[1:07:22] hey i saw you stretch that rod across
[1:07:26] that land amen
[1:07:27] i saw that i heard about the round right
[1:07:29] you heard on wednesday
[1:07:30] i heard about the rod being thrown down
[1:07:33] before pharaoh
[1:07:34] i heard that rod's got power i've heard
[1:07:37] you've got faith in god i heard that
[1:07:39] rise is supernatural surely
[1:07:42] yes i'll go out and fight because i know
[1:07:44] god is with you
[1:07:45] he's given you signs miracles and
[1:07:47] wonders and god is with us amen
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:56] so joshua did as moses said unto him did
[1:07:58] he argue did he complain
[1:08:01] did he run away from the camp church
[1:08:04] no he went and did that which the
[1:08:07] prophet told him to do
[1:08:08] amen and fought with amulek and josh and
[1:08:11] moses
[1:08:12] aaron and her went up to the top of the
[1:08:13] hill i like that
[1:08:15] he's up on the hill and he's got his
[1:08:17] arms out like this so all josh had to do
[1:08:19] is look up and say
[1:08:20] ah the cross i see the cross and it's on
[1:08:23] the rock
[1:08:24] of revelation and as long as that
[1:08:26] crosses the arms rough
[1:08:28] they got their victory amen as long as
[1:08:30] the cross was proclaimed
[1:08:32] that's why the bible said the preaching
[1:08:33] of the cross is salvation to
[1:08:35] us we just had to look and as long as
[1:08:39] those brothers did their part
[1:08:41] as long as aaron and her held up moses's
[1:08:44] hands
[1:08:45] all that time then the people would get
[1:08:47] victorious oh
[1:08:48] and that's what brother said if you can
[1:08:50] just hold up your preachers in prayer
[1:08:52] and i'll say like this if you can just
[1:08:54] hold up your brothers and sisters in
[1:08:55] prayer
[1:08:56] we'll get the victory hold them up in
[1:08:59] prayer
[1:09:00] keep battling keep looking to the cross
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:03] keep looking to jesus look at the
[1:09:05] victory amen
[1:09:07] i get to defeat god's army because even
[1:09:10] you know that
[1:09:10] we can't nobody can stop us praise god
[1:09:13] nobody can defeat god's army
[1:09:15] because we've got the cross of jesus
[1:09:17] amen amen hallelujah
[1:09:21] as long as everybody holds themselves up
[1:09:23] in prayer
[1:09:24] as long as everybody's praying and
[1:09:26] believing
[1:09:28] and looking to the cross we'll get the
[1:09:30] victory
[1:09:32] amen now just interesting
[1:09:35] these amalekites were the descendants of
[1:09:37] esau jacob and esau two twins
[1:09:40] see that always that evil spirit that
[1:09:42] oil that that will always come back to
[1:09:44] fight you
[1:09:45] in other words that anti-christ spirit
[1:09:47] is always going to be there to battle
[1:09:49] you but don't worry
[1:09:50] we've got god's word on our side praise
[1:09:52] god we've got the round of god
[1:09:55] praise god the rest of the round of god
[1:09:57] was the name of jesus because it was the
[1:09:59] power of god
[1:10:00] amen don't worry
[1:10:03] that's where that spiritual twin is
[1:10:05] going to try to rise up and fight
[1:10:07] against us
[1:10:08] but we'll overcome him because we're on
[1:10:10] god's side
[1:10:14] and i like what he says next remind
[1:10:16] joshua
[1:10:17] so they got the victory and the bible
[1:10:19] said
[1:10:22] he said discomfort with the edge of the
[1:10:23] sword what's the sword the word of god
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:26] the joshua spoke the word he fought with
[1:10:28] the word
[1:10:29] and got a great victory and the lord
[1:10:32] said write
[1:10:33] for a memorial in a book rehearse it in
[1:10:35] the ears of joshua for i will utterly
[1:10:37] put out the remembrance of hamlet under
[1:10:39] heaven
[1:10:40] so god told josh to remember this
[1:10:42] because he had to pass it down to king
[1:10:44] saul
[1:10:45] and king hezekiah who would finish the
[1:10:47] work
[1:10:48] praise god i i know you're with me
[1:10:53] but church if we don't see the rapture
[1:10:54] in our time you better believe
[1:10:56] i'm going to pass down this thus saith
[1:10:58] the lord about the former latter reign
[1:11:00] i'm going to pass it down to the next
[1:11:02] generation praise god
[1:11:04] because that's how they're going to
[1:11:05] overcome that reign is rapturing faith
[1:11:08] praise god
[1:11:10] stay under the teaching ring like we saw
[1:11:12] on wednesday right
[1:11:13] said that teaching reign sarah was
[1:11:15] visited by two angels
[1:11:17] the former reign that discerned and then
[1:11:19] the latter rage
[1:11:21] that brought the body change amen did
[1:11:23] you see that on wednesday
[1:11:24] that was glorious i never seen him
[1:11:26] before
[1:11:28] genesis 18 the angel came
[1:11:31] and discerned like brother ran to serve
[1:11:33] that was the former reign the former
[1:11:34] visitation
[1:11:35] and then the lateran came in genesis 21
[1:11:38] when the lord visited sarah
[1:11:40] according to the times and seasons
[1:11:42] according to the time of rapturing life
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:46] oh that you got the body change oh thank
[1:11:52] god
[1:11:55] see that's our job church remember how
[1:11:58] we got the victory
[1:11:59] how did you get victory over the
[1:12:01] temptations in your life and you and i
[1:12:03] have to pass that to the next generation
[1:12:06] we may not see the rapture
[1:12:08] but we've got to pass it on to the next
[1:12:09] one because it's thus saith the lord
[1:12:11] somebody glory somebody is going to have
[1:12:15] death swallowed up in victory
[1:12:18] oh my i may not be the one that feels
[1:12:21] you know jeremiah felt it like fire in
[1:12:23] his
[1:12:23] bones right but we're gonna have more
[1:12:25] than that praise god
[1:12:26] we're gonna have like fire just engulf
[1:12:28] all of us and give us a brand new body
[1:12:32] in a moment i would tweak the light
[1:12:34] somebody is going to see death
[1:12:36] swallowed up in life hear me man
[1:12:39] but if it doesn't joshua you pass it
[1:12:41] down to the next generation
[1:12:42] brother sister you pass it down tell
[1:12:44] them somebody is going to conquer death
[1:12:48] somebody won't have to go to funeral
[1:12:50] service
[1:12:52] somebody will conquer and defeat them
[1:12:54] because death
[1:12:55] has lost its state amen amen
[1:13:00] hallelujah
[1:13:03] saul started it as a guy finished it
[1:13:07] destroyed that esau seed
[1:13:10] antichrist that twin antichrist seed
[1:13:16] the second mention shows his servant's
[1:13:19] heart again
[1:13:20] moses wanted the young general with him
[1:13:24] josh was closer to moses than the 70
[1:13:25] elders because he said the lord said
[1:13:27] come up to me in the mouth and i'll be
[1:13:29] there
[1:13:29] i'll give you the tables of stone. and
[1:13:32] joshua rose up in his
[1:13:34] servant i like that don't you
[1:13:39] he knew he wasn't the top man right
[1:13:42] he wasn't the major guy he wasn't the
[1:13:44] top god but he was going to do
[1:13:46] everything he could to support that
[1:13:48] servant of god
[1:13:50] oh thank you lord and moses went up in
[1:13:53] the mount of god i know the scriptures
[1:13:54] up here but you know
[1:13:55] the 70s stopped at a certain location
[1:13:57] but josh when moses
[1:13:59] went a little higher hey to get the
[1:14:02] revelation
[1:14:03] amen and the bible says we're seated in
[1:14:05] heavenly places we've gone higher
[1:14:08] than denominations can go praise god
[1:14:10] we've gone higher because we're the
[1:14:12] joshua praise god
[1:14:14] we go up higher and we get the
[1:14:15] revelation that other people don't know
[1:14:17] anything about
[1:14:21] i thought i'd get a couple amens out of
[1:14:22] that one
[1:14:26] glory we don't get the law in stone we
[1:14:28] get it written
[1:14:29] on the fleshly tables of our hearts
[1:14:33] hallelujah glory
[1:14:39] that's good the third mention shows that
[1:14:42] he could discern
[1:14:43] sin just by the sound of the people
[1:14:47] as soon as they come down they got the
[1:14:49] tables who's the first one that speaks
[1:14:51] up
[1:14:51] joshua this don't sound like the holy
[1:14:54] ghost
[1:14:56] this sounds like a whirling party
[1:14:59] who picked that up first joshua
[1:15:04] she said this is the noise of war in the
[1:15:06] camp
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:08] they said it's not the voice moses is
[1:15:10] not the voice of them that shout for
[1:15:11] mastery
[1:15:12] he's the voice of the net cry for being
[1:15:14] overcome but the noise of them
[1:15:16] that's seeing you out here so see joshua
[1:15:17] picked it up it wasn't a natural war it
[1:15:20] was a spiritual war
[1:15:22] they were worshiping that idol right so
[1:15:25] see that means true
[1:15:26] worship will always sound different than
[1:15:28] the false gods
[1:15:30] amen our churches are yes you've heard
[1:15:33] it
[1:15:34] how you hear it on youtube right when
[1:15:35] you listen to good stuff and the sound
[1:15:37] of the praising afterward doesn't really
[1:15:38] sound like praise
[1:15:40] it sounds like oh good good song that's
[1:15:43] not
[1:15:44] that's the wrong sound praise god amen
[1:15:47] we're not here to exalt man
[1:15:48] we're not here to exalt women we're here
[1:15:50] to praise jesus christ
[1:15:52] amen it has a different sound hallelujah
[1:15:55] listen to brothers prayer eyes sometimes
[1:15:57] you hear the real sound of worship amen
[1:16:00] you hear the noise in the camp of
[1:16:02] deliverance a praise
[1:16:04] a victory of thanksgiving of joy
[1:16:07] of peace there's a sound to it amen
[1:16:12] that's why i can do my shout in the
[1:16:13] church too i want to make sure it's the
[1:16:14] right sound praise god
[1:16:16] it's the sound of praise it's the sound
[1:16:18] of worship coming up before god
[1:16:21] that's what we need today amen joshua
[1:16:24] could pick that up right away
[1:16:25] doesn't sound like it doesn't sound like
[1:16:27] these people are really worshiping today
[1:16:31] oh my thank god amen thank god church if
[1:16:35] you're worshiping jesus
[1:16:36] in spirit and in truth
[1:16:40] i'm about at my hour here so let me see
[1:16:44] i've got a whole lot of preaching today
[1:16:47] fourth mentioned i love this one shows
[1:16:49] his desire
[1:16:50] to see god moses remember he got all the
[1:16:53] directions
[1:16:54] to build the the the tabernacle like in
[1:16:56] exodus 21 22-35
[1:16:59] but here they finally set it up in
[1:17:01] exodus 33
[1:17:02] and moses took it pitched it without the
[1:17:04] camp a far off from the camp and
[1:17:06] called it to the table that i'm trying
[1:17:08] to tabernacle the foundation
[1:17:09] and it came to pass when everyone would
[1:17:11] stop the lord went out of the tabernacle
[1:17:13] the congregation
[1:17:14] which was without the camp notice where
[1:17:16] he set it up did he set it right outside
[1:17:18] their tents
[1:17:19] no if they wanted to meet with god they
[1:17:22] had to leave
[1:17:23] their common everyday life and then to
[1:17:25] physically make a little
[1:17:26] journey to go out and worship god
[1:17:30] see because god likes to see who's gonna
[1:17:31] sacrifice
[1:17:33] who really wants to worship i like this
[1:17:35] god wants to see who really wants to see
[1:17:38] god that's what we got today anybody can
[1:17:41] come to any message church you can do
[1:17:42] that
[1:17:43] but the question is are you seeking god
[1:17:45] did you come to see
[1:17:46] god did you come to receive of god were
[1:17:49] you hungry for god
[1:17:50] joshua was out there constantly moses
[1:17:53] even left the tabernacle but joshua
[1:17:56] lived out there grace god
[1:17:58] joshua stayed out there seeking the lord
[1:18:00] that's what we've got to do
[1:18:02] continue to seek god all the time
[1:18:05] look what the bible says 11 lord
[1:18:08] speaking of moses face to face
[1:18:10] as a man speaking under his friend and
[1:18:12] he turned again into the camp
[1:18:15] so moses moses was going there brother
[1:18:17] amen he'd go right in the house of
[1:18:18] holies and he'd get face to face with
[1:18:20] god
[1:18:20] and he would leave out but joshua he
[1:18:23] couldn't go in the holy spirit
[1:18:24] but he would just stay there and seek
[1:18:26] god all the time
[1:18:28] he was just seeking after god's presence
[1:18:30] why he was a servant
[1:18:33] he was humble he wanted to make sure he
[1:18:36] knew
[1:18:37] the will of god he wanted to constantly
[1:18:39] seek the lord
[1:18:40] he departed not out of the tabernacle
[1:18:44] but he wasn't a priest so he couldn't go
[1:18:46] into the holiest i'm sure the holy place
[1:18:48] so he spent all that time in the outer
[1:18:51] court can you imagine that
[1:18:53] all that time out there in the outer
[1:18:55] court where there's sacrifices and
[1:18:57] pray that's what we do amen right
[1:19:00] we praise god we worship god he spent
[1:19:03] all this time he didn't like to leave
[1:19:05] he liked to stay in that atmosphere oh
[1:19:07] may god help us to stay in that
[1:19:08] atmosphere
[1:19:11] what did he learn from joshua warrior
[1:19:14] he's quit the battle he stayed in god's
[1:19:18] presence amen
[1:19:19] he loved to seek god
[1:19:23] this is what i found out about holy
[1:19:26] ghost real people all these things
[1:19:27] they're servants
[1:19:28] they want to stay in the in the presence
[1:19:30] of god they want to keep seeking god
[1:19:33] they want to know god better can i say
[1:19:35] it like that
[1:19:37] they want to know him better oh praise
[1:19:40] god
[1:19:42] the fifth mention he had zeal for moses
[1:19:45] but here he got corrected so see joshua
[1:19:47] was a perfect
[1:19:48] this is kind of like the moment where
[1:19:50] peter gets directed by jesus you know
[1:19:52] different places
[1:19:53] now joshua the son of none the servant
[1:19:55] of moses one of his young men answered
[1:19:56] and said
[1:19:57] my lord moses forbid them these were the
[1:19:59] men that were trying to help out moses
[1:20:02] remember moses has prayed and complained
[1:20:04] said god you
[1:20:05] what are you making me father over two
[1:20:06] million people remember he complained
[1:20:09] so what god do god said go down there to
[1:20:11] the tabernacle
[1:20:12] i'll take my spirit i'll divide it on 70
[1:20:15] others and joshua said no
[1:20:16] no but moses said unto him envious thou
[1:20:20] for my sake joshua
[1:20:23] he said would god that all the lord's
[1:20:25] people were prophets
[1:20:26] and that the lord would put his spirit
[1:20:28] upon them
[1:20:29] so this is one time joshua had to learn
[1:20:32] he was so zealous for moses
[1:20:35] he didn't understand that god wanted
[1:20:37] that blessing god
[1:20:38] god wants everybody to be a prophet in
[1:20:41] other words god wants
[1:20:42] all of us to have the holy ghost going
[1:20:44] through our lives amen right because bob
[1:20:46] said not all prophesied and i don't
[1:20:48] speak with tongues not all due healings
[1:20:50] but god wants his spirit flowing through
[1:20:52] all of our lives he wants everybody
[1:20:54] anointed
[1:20:55] amen so this is the one time we see
[1:20:59] joshua has to be corrected now and we
[1:21:00] know he made a mistake with the gibby
[1:21:02] knights as well right
[1:21:03] jimmy knights dressed up like they were
[1:21:06] all defeated and they tricked joshua
[1:21:07] joshua
[1:21:08] he paid for it we'll get to that
[1:21:11] he regretted that he couldn't take back
[1:21:13] his word of the lord that he spoke
[1:21:17] i want you to see that he was out so
[1:21:18] zealous for moses
[1:21:20] that he didn't understand the plan of
[1:21:22] god now there's a scripture there
[1:21:26] oh yeah mark 9 39 let me read that
[1:21:28] that's a good scripture this was uh
[1:21:30] jameson fawcett and brown
[1:21:31] and brother graham did use this
[1:21:32] commentary a little bit i have a few
[1:21:34] quotes on that
[1:21:36] mark 9 39.
[1:21:46] and this kind of goes back to what we
[1:21:48] said with these preachers falling away
[1:21:49] but look at verse
[1:21:50] 39. now remember they tried somebody who
[1:21:53] was casting out devils and wasn't
[1:21:54] following
[1:21:55] the disciples verse 39 but jesus said
[1:21:58] forbid him not for there is no man which
[1:22:00] shall do a miracle my name
[1:22:02] that can speak or lightly speak evil of
[1:22:04] me
[1:22:07] see that's what all these this is what
[1:22:08] all these uh the false anointed ones of
[1:22:10] the end times
[1:22:11] watch their words they never say
[1:22:13] anything evil against jesus
[1:22:16] but they got closet sins they got secret
[1:22:19] sins
[1:22:20] that they indulge in right and that's
[1:22:23] the danger here
[1:22:24] because most of all most of us we're not
[1:22:26] going to see any
[1:22:27] outward sins right like i told you the
[1:22:29] first one is usually people stop coming
[1:22:31] to terms
[1:22:31] that's usually the first indicator that
[1:22:34] they're really going to backslide
[1:22:36] the power says gather more she said they
[1:22:38] approaching well if you pull off and
[1:22:39] gather less
[1:22:40] that's a good sign you're not physically
[1:22:43] drawing hopes of god that's a good sign
[1:22:44] you're not spiritually drawing closer to
[1:22:46] god
[1:22:48] but here this is what they'll do they'll
[1:22:51] use the name of jesus always speak
[1:22:52] highly of that
[1:22:53] but then they will hide their sins
[1:22:57] and so we must see how this is why
[1:22:59] people can do it people can do miracles
[1:23:01] they can speak wonderful things of god
[1:23:02] have all kinds of uh acts that are great
[1:23:05] acts and
[1:23:06] help people but then they can forsake
[1:23:08] that anointing
[1:23:09] and they can go off to the evil spirit
[1:23:12] anointing as well
[1:23:14] thank god for the holy spirit because
[1:23:16] it's the spirit of truth
[1:23:19] truth what is the truth god help us
[1:23:22] always speak the truth
[1:23:25] admit the truth be honest praise god
[1:23:28] that's what we need to be in this day
[1:23:30] the spirit of truth because like that
[1:23:33] preacher i was saying
[1:23:34] they asked them new times are you doing
[1:23:35] this he flat out denied it and got angry
[1:23:38] so you watch when people get angry you
[1:23:40] watch many times it's a good sign they
[1:23:42] might not be right with god
[1:23:45] they get angry about you if you're
[1:23:46] trying to correct them about something
[1:23:48] and they get angry instead of humble
[1:23:50] watch that spirit watch that spirit i
[1:23:53] know don't get wrong jesus didn't flip
[1:23:55] over the money table
[1:23:56] the money changed he did it in anger we
[1:23:59] know he never said
[1:24:01] but watch humans right watch humanity
[1:24:04] today
[1:24:06] when they get mad that you're trying to
[1:24:09] ask them a little question or ask them
[1:24:11] uh about some integrity or
[1:24:13] things like that you see it all the time
[1:24:14] with children don't you
[1:24:18] yeah i see it all the time in school
[1:24:19] with children you try to correct them
[1:24:20] and they get mad or they get
[1:24:22] why are you getting mad if you're so
[1:24:24] innocent why are you getting mad about
[1:24:25] it
[1:24:28] i see that all the time that's usually
[1:24:31] how i know the ones that's upset
[1:24:33] the one that does sin
[1:24:36] the sixth mention shows joshua's faith
[1:24:39] in possessing the promised land
[1:24:42] he was one of the spies moses picked him
[1:24:45] him and caleb were two of the twelve and
[1:24:47] they went over
[1:24:49] and they saw the evidence of the land
[1:24:51] and they come back and this chapter
[1:24:52] opens but they're all upset they're all
[1:24:54] sad
[1:24:55] they're all screaming saying let's raise
[1:24:57] the captain up we don't want moses
[1:24:58] anymore let's face up a new prophet
[1:25:02] oh god is that what they got today
[1:25:05] but the bible said joshua and caleb
[1:25:08] search the land they rent their clothes
[1:25:10] they were so heartbroken
[1:25:12] look what god has done see joshua knew
[1:25:14] joshua knew god helped us defeat the
[1:25:16] amalekites
[1:25:17] we went through the red sea we we've got
[1:25:20] manna reigning down from heaven
[1:25:21] how can god be against us god is for us
[1:25:24] amen
[1:25:27] he read his clothes and say can't you
[1:25:29] see if god he says it like this he said
[1:25:31] if god
[1:25:32] delights in us god has blessed us he'll
[1:25:34] bring us into the land and give it to us
[1:25:36] a land was flowing with milk and honey
[1:25:43] church don't we know there's so many
[1:25:45] great blessings ahead of us can i say
[1:25:46] like that
[1:25:48] either way either way natural
[1:25:50] spiritually god's gonna protect us right
[1:25:52] but either way spiritually especially
[1:25:55] there are so many blessings ahead of us
[1:25:57] praise god
[1:25:59] if this crossing over represent the
[1:26:01] third floor
[1:26:02] there's so many more blessings waiting
[1:26:04] there praise god
[1:26:06] amen and if you're not born again
[1:26:08] there's so many blessings ahead of you
[1:26:10] oh there's so many victories ahead of
[1:26:12] you praise god
[1:26:14] oh it's not the time to quit it's not
[1:26:16] the time to be fearful
[1:26:17] it's not the time to give up it's time
[1:26:19] to go forward
[1:26:20] speak his word and go for it
[1:26:25] oh my thank you lord because god
[1:26:28] delighted you that's the question
[1:26:30] yes he does because he called me by
[1:26:33] grace saying that
[1:26:34] i didn't go looking for him he came
[1:26:36] looking for me
[1:26:38] he delights in me praise god he delights
[1:26:40] in you he delights in all his people
[1:26:43] praise god
[1:26:50] so there are the two voices he's one of
[1:26:51] the two voices that rises up
[1:26:53] the sixth mansion shows his faith in
[1:26:56] possessing the land he said only rebel
[1:26:58] not against the lord
[1:26:59] just don't transgress the word just keep
[1:27:02] the word
[1:27:03] neither fear the people that don't be
[1:27:05] afraid and keep the word amen
[1:27:08] for they are bred for us their defense
[1:27:11] is departed from them and the lord is
[1:27:12] with us
[1:27:13] hear them look hear them now look what
[1:27:14] he's saying we're just going to eat
[1:27:15] these guys up
[1:27:17] we're going to eat them up and spit them
[1:27:19] out look at the language god uses here
[1:27:22] they're just food to us we're just going
[1:27:24] to consume them church that's how we got
[1:27:26] to see all of our battles
[1:27:27] it's just going to be a victory we're
[1:27:29] going to devour it by the power of god
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:33] whether it's a family situation whether
[1:27:34] it's a personal situation
[1:27:36] these battles that are before force
[1:27:38] they're there so we'll overcome that
[1:27:44] praise god but the rest of the church
[1:27:47] wanted to stone them with stones
[1:27:50] right there's a few message believers in
[1:27:52] the church that believe it
[1:27:53] everybody else went to stone oh my
[1:27:57] and the glory lord appeared in the
[1:27:58] tabernacle of the congregation before
[1:28:00] all the children of israel thank god for
[1:28:02] his glory
[1:28:03] amen thank god his glory appears
[1:28:06] and answers our prayers amen
[1:28:13] he amen doubtless you shall not come
[1:28:15] into the land concerning which i swear
[1:28:17] to make you dwell therein
[1:28:18] save caleb the son of jeffer and joshua
[1:28:21] the son of nun
[1:28:21] but your little ones which he said
[1:28:23] should be afraid
[1:28:25] then will i bring in and they shall know
[1:28:27] the land
[1:28:28] which ye have despised now look at you
[1:28:30] need to catch that church
[1:28:33] the older generation was saying oh our
[1:28:35] children are just gonna
[1:28:36] they're just gonna be destroyed that's
[1:28:38] what people say today or our kids will
[1:28:39] never take the rapture
[1:28:40] our kids can never overcome cell phones
[1:28:42] or our kids can never overcome this
[1:28:44] god turns around and says the very ones
[1:28:46] you thought would be wimpy
[1:28:48] or weak they're the ones that's gonna
[1:28:49] take it praise god
[1:28:51] because the bigger the challenge the
[1:28:53] bigger the victory with joshua praise
[1:28:55] god
[1:28:56] amen these parents ought to be happy
[1:28:58] here today
[1:29:00] amen we should be happy and thankful
[1:29:04] that the god who brought us out is going
[1:29:06] to bring our children from canada praise
[1:29:08] god
[1:29:09] amen the greater the giant the greater
[1:29:12] the victory in god's eyes
[1:29:13] amen the bigger they are the harder they
[1:29:16] fall praise god
[1:29:18] that's right
[1:29:25] how about tell the story i'm not going
[1:29:26] to it's kind of
[1:29:28] it's kind of a cardinal story for my
[1:29:30] football games i think i'll pass them
[1:29:32] out
[1:29:33] it's very similar to get a much bigger
[1:29:35] opponent we meet them just kind of
[1:29:36] similar story like
[1:29:37] but he says they were scared for their
[1:29:40] children
[1:29:41] how the children are going to overcome
[1:29:43] oh god's still here
[1:29:44] see our god never checks out right
[1:29:48] the world their gods come and go their
[1:29:50] anointing comes and goes
[1:29:51] my anointing doesn't come and go my
[1:29:53] anointing is in the soul
[1:29:54] and it's in my soul to the day of
[1:29:56] redemption praise god
[1:29:58] i might not feel it out here but friends
[1:30:00] it never leaves when it's in here praise
[1:30:01] god
[1:30:03] pretty soon we'll come around to it
[1:30:04] right this this doesn't leave praise god
[1:30:07] our god is with us
[1:30:08] he said i'll be with you even in you to
[1:30:10] the end of the age
[1:30:15] but as for you oh generation lorem did
[1:30:18] call them intellectual giants like we
[1:30:20] just had an intellectual giant fall
[1:30:22] he said as for you they'll fall in the
[1:30:24] wilderness
[1:30:26] the seventh mention
[1:30:30] is joshua showing he and caleb are the
[1:30:32] only two left two out of two million or
[1:30:34] one out of a million how many believe
[1:30:37] you're one out of a million today
[1:30:39] i believe that the eighth mention is
[1:30:42] joshua asking moses
[1:30:44] i'm sorry moses is asking god to set
[1:30:45] joshua as a leader
[1:30:47] now look at here joshua had some of
[1:30:49] moses's honor but not all
[1:30:53] and he became like a shepherd to israel
[1:30:54] moses prayed and said god
[1:30:56] would you anoint joshua that he can be a
[1:30:58] shepherd he can go before the people
[1:31:01] come in because the people need a leader
[1:31:02] praise god amen
[1:31:05] he said will you do that now like i said
[1:31:07] some of the honor because nobody was
[1:31:09] going to touch moses
[1:31:11] that was god's servant he was the
[1:31:12] meekest man on earth
[1:31:14] that's right that's a big portion now
[1:31:16] that this also includes the part where
[1:31:18] moses sinned against god
[1:31:19] and moses like god will you give me a
[1:31:21] second chance to go over and god said
[1:31:22] don't talk to me about that anymore
[1:31:25] god was so upset that moses glorified
[1:31:27] himself that even when moses asked a
[1:31:30] second or third time god said don't talk
[1:31:31] to me about that
[1:31:32] church may god help us to always be
[1:31:34] humble right
[1:31:36] and not magnify ourselves not try to
[1:31:38] show off
[1:31:39] but just be humble and just do what the
[1:31:42] word says
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:47] now i think there's 15 mentions here
[1:31:52] okay i'm going to skip ahead i'm closing
[1:31:54] with this i'll just get past those
[1:31:56] that told y'all not to preach today okay
[1:31:59] so as i was with moses let's let's close
[1:32:01] with this
[1:32:02] verse five said there shall not any man
[1:32:04] be able to stick
[1:32:06] all the days of thy life
[1:32:10] once the servant once the faithful
[1:32:12] servant
[1:32:13] who constantly sought god
[1:32:16] brothers and sisters we need to
[1:32:18] constantly seek god
[1:32:20] once this faithful servant who all the
[1:32:22] time just stayed at the church
[1:32:25] he just said he just wanted to stay at
[1:32:26] the church and just be in god's presence
[1:32:28] just see god all the time study god's
[1:32:31] word pray
[1:32:32] ask for wisdom once that servant finally
[1:32:35] got there
[1:32:36] and got in place and got his position
[1:32:38] the holy spirit said
[1:32:40] no man will be able to defeat you all
[1:32:42] the days in your life
[1:32:44] now we know what happened right he had
[1:32:46] one mistake there with the gimme nights
[1:32:48] but every time he got back right with
[1:32:50] god
[1:32:52] nobody could stand before him
[1:32:55] right doesn't that apply to us as well
[1:32:59] praise god what man or what woman is
[1:33:02] going to defy or stand before
[1:33:04] and defy and overcome the bride of jesus
[1:33:07] there won't be a woman
[1:33:09] you believe that he said as long as you
[1:33:14] stay with the words as long as you
[1:33:15] meditate on the things of god and do it
[1:33:18] day and night
[1:33:19] no man or woman will be able to stand
[1:33:21] before you all the days of your life
[1:33:24] what a promise church in other words
[1:33:27] sounds like somebody's invincible praise
[1:33:29] god amen
[1:33:32] because with god all things will be
[1:33:34] possible
[1:33:36] you're only invincible because you're
[1:33:37] obedient to god right
[1:33:39] no man will be able to stand before you
[1:33:42] all the days
[1:33:43] of your life
[1:33:47] that's real to me right because last
[1:33:49] year billy paul joseph branham
[1:33:51] rod bergen and it wasn't me
[1:33:54] but it was the word i saw the word that
[1:33:57] no one
[1:33:58] could stand above and deny this word
[1:34:01] praise god
[1:34:03] nobody can overcome it nobody can bring
[1:34:06] something against the real revelation of
[1:34:07] jesus christ
[1:34:08] amen nobody can
[1:34:12] defeat that right because it is the
[1:34:16] it is the all-powerful it's the living
[1:34:18] sharp sword of god's word
[1:34:20] that discerns the thoughts and intents
[1:34:22] of the hearts praise god
[1:34:24] amen glory
[1:34:28] he said as i was with the prophet so
[1:34:30] would i be with you
[1:34:32] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:34:35] be strong we're going to go over this
[1:34:36] one of these sermons coming up morgan
[1:34:38] this
[1:34:39] is this phrase is said about 10 times in
[1:34:41] the bible
[1:34:43] moses tells joshua over and over be
[1:34:46] strong and be of good courage
[1:34:49] don't be weak and discouraged
[1:34:54] don't be weak i'm gonna have to keep
[1:34:56] repeating it to you too because i need
[1:34:58] it too
[1:34:59] moses says it like five times be strong
[1:35:02] and courageous because god is with you
[1:35:05] praise god
[1:35:06] don't be afraid there's nothing to fear
[1:35:10] joshua
[1:35:19] thank god
[1:35:22] he said you're gonna divide this people
[1:35:26] he said but just meditate on the word
[1:35:29] no one will be able to withstand you or
[1:35:32] stand before you all the days
[1:35:34] of your life that proved it to me i
[1:35:36] remember when i was so nervous writing
[1:35:37] joseph amelia i remember
[1:35:39] i remember shaking i remember shaking
[1:35:41] right here i shook right here before
[1:35:42] that debate
[1:35:44] i remember that and i've had some i've
[1:35:47] had some meetings with people that left
[1:35:48] the church where i was shaking and
[1:35:49] praying and fasting before too
[1:35:51] but in the presence of the holy spirit
[1:35:53] no man or woman has been able to stand
[1:35:56] in the presence of this revelation that
[1:35:59] god put in my heart
[1:36:00] i said like this i believe put in your
[1:36:02] heart as well
[1:36:03] amen hallelujah
[1:36:11] and like johnny and i were texting this
[1:36:13] week there's prophecies
[1:36:15] that they're prophesying on a
[1:36:17] jeffersonville and they're totally wrong
[1:36:20] they said they said their church in the
[1:36:22] name of the lord they're in the perfect
[1:36:23] will
[1:36:24] by just playing tapes well that goes
[1:36:27] against
[1:36:27] evan they said in the name of the lord
[1:36:30] now they're using god's name
[1:36:34] well how come the bible don't say that
[1:36:36] how come brother brandon never said that
[1:36:38] brother brown gave permission on two
[1:36:40] cases to play the tapes yeah
[1:36:43] and both of them were they didn't have a
[1:36:45] preacher
[1:36:46] but let me tell you there's a lot of
[1:36:48] good preachers around jeffersonville
[1:36:50] yeah i know cam knows him brother brooks
[1:36:52] knows them there's a lot of good
[1:36:54] preachers they can support there
[1:36:55] that really preach the word of god but
[1:36:58] they said in the name of the lord
[1:36:59] they're in the perfect will of god
[1:37:01] shutting down preachers and just push
[1:37:04] play
[1:37:06] now we'll see what happens now
[1:37:09] sometimes god sometimes god will quickly
[1:37:12] bring a correction
[1:37:13] sometimes god lets it wait out
[1:37:16] depending on his plan for that person's
[1:37:18] life let's be careful how we use the
[1:37:21] name of the lord
[1:37:24] because remember we know we already got
[1:37:26] thus saith the lord paul said you
[1:37:27] changed one word of this
[1:37:28] you're cursed you already know about
[1:37:30] satan
[1:37:32] it's not to be changed it's to be kept
[1:37:34] pure
[1:37:36] you believe that i want to close this
[1:37:39] quote i want to encourage you
[1:37:42] and you can you can stop the livestream
[1:37:43] god bless you i just want to share this
[1:37:44] i feel like i feel the
[1:37:47] can you lord that
