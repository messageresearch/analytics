========================================

praise the Lord hallelujah let's get right in the word of God here tonight let's go to a second I'm sorry first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 21. let's I want to like to look at this thought again of approve all things I'm going back to this series I haven't preached it since December so it's been about nine months or ten months but I want to not just preach one more sermon on this I want to call it prove all things part 18 the word test I want to look at the word test here tonight I'm going to show numerous scriptures and then lots of quotes from Brother Branham so bear with me I have lots of quotes we'll see how it goes by the grace of the Lord first Thessalonians 5 21. praise God let's read 21 and then I'll read 22 and 23 myself but let's read 21 together ready one two three prove all things hold fast that which is good now I'll read 22 and 23. abstain from all appearance of evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy so see Church we're always going to need more sanctification brother Brandon called it the Shaving down like that sheep illustration we gave on Sunday so you always need shaving down and I pray God your whole Spirit that's your mind and your soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ Now isn't this this doesn't this seem impossible how could I be blameless when I sin every day but yet the blood of Jesus Christ makes us blame us Paul wouldn't write it if it wasn't possible it is possible through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ aren't you glad he makes you blameless you just confess your sins he washes it wide as snow God bless you you may be seated by God's grace and then Keisha why don't you pull up Acts 17 11 and then after that I have some slides we'll show I'm going to try to set a timer here by the grace of the Lord just got to be wary of the be aware rather of the time acts 17 11 these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they receive the word of God with all Readiness of mine and search the scriptures daily whether those things were so and just leave that up there for a moment this is a very familiar scripture to us I feel like you know God has given me a Ministry to teach the word of God also preach you know the Bible said these things command and preach these things command and teach so we're preaching and teaching the word of God this is a beautiful scripture uh Paul had preached to the bereans as you'll see in verse 10 but just leave that up there and the Bible said those in Berea were more noble than those in thessalonica because everything the prophet said they took it back to the word of God they spent their days hearing the prophet and then they'd go check the scriptures to make sure the prophet was right now George I hope you know I know you've been with me a long time I know you love me I love you but I hope we get to this spot I I trust we're there where we'll hear the sermons but then we'll also go read our Bible on Monday and Tuesday praise God and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday make sure you check your pastor by the word of God because Church the way churches stumble is they get comfortable and they stop checking what's said by the word of God now many times maybe you don't feel like you have to check me because I give you a scripture and a quote that's what I want to do I hope that's that's always my practice I hope that's always my habit is to give you a scripture give you a quote praise God I hope that's always my practice and I believe it will be but also Church you know you should take the things that's preached and you should go search it in the scriptures praise God you should have a concert because the Bible calls it Noble how many believe you're a spiritual King a spiritual Queen if you are then the Bible says you'll search the scriptures every day you'll study you'll comb you'll take notes or you'll you'll you'll look deeper at the word of God and say what can God teach me today because we don't have it all figured out right we don't have every answer praise God we all need to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord and so as we look at this thought on the word test and notice they they gave the word test to the prophet of the hour Paul Paul was the first church age Messenger right of Ephesus and they didn't just take his word and say wow I've seen enough from Paul I don't have to I don't have to look at what uh the Bible says about what Paul's preaching no they didn't take that for granted they made sure every day they took what the prophet said and pointed it back to the word praise God now if you would uh would you switch over there acacia now church I am a living example of this and so are you in other words we listen to brother Branham and then we go see what what he said make sure it was in the word of God and so this week I put out two videos like this brother William as you know too as we listen to the program every day as we listen to them or very often we hear so much that's true but then we hear The Human Side okay and so this is a proof uh this video series I've been working on this is a proof that we I take what the prophet said and I take everything back to the word of God now 95 or whatever I say 90 99 whatever you want to say a 90 percentage of what he says is right but then there's the Human Side that's just like every other man on the Earth and George if God didn't hide Paul's sins or Peter sins or David sins if God didn't hide Moses's sins from us well then why would God hide brother and sins from us why would we why would he afraid of Brothers mistakes if we're not afraid of David's mistakes that's why people criticize us or criticize People Like Us message churches like us who believe you have to show brother's Human Side and the reason they do that is because they criticize us is because they've got a deity spirit they're worshiping the man more than Jesus Christ but that's why God put all that in there about all Moses's failures all of Peter's failures because it would point to the fact there's only one worthy to open the seals and loose the Seven Seals thereof that was the Lamb of Hallelujah Glory now right now I've got 67 or 68 just examples of how brother man made human mistakes or he grew in his Revelation or brother around has quotes on two on both sides of an issue and they can't be both thus saith the Lord okay now this week I was listening to another sermon the rapture and I found a couple more human mistakes like for example he said Enoch walked with God 500 years and I can take you to the Book of Genesis and the Bible said all the days of Enoch's life were 365 years now who are you going to believe church I mean what are you going to believe that they say every word is thus saith the Lord I mean but then I find so much truth about this shout voice Trump and the coming of the Lord I mean just beautiful Revelations but you can't help it as you're listening you've got to take everything a prophet says back to the word of God and this series is not any anybody that loves God would know this series is to show not every word on brother Brown's tapes as thou saith the Lord and it's absolute proof and so I made a blog post our 67 proofs enough to prove to these people that not every word is thus say the Lord if it isn't then they're clearly deceived and they're confused but God is not the author of confusion praise God and God loves an honest heart amen that's actually the good ground is the good and honest heart praise God that brings forth fruit Hallelujah fruit under Perfection and if somebody can't be honest enough of themselves to say brother man was human then they can't be honest enough to even know they're saved how can they be honest enough to be saved or know they have the Holy Ghost and they can't honestly look at the fact that there's human mistakes on a tape how can they be honest with God if they can't be honest with men you can't be that's that's the reality you can't be honest with God if you're not honest with your man your fellow man and woman I'm sorry fellow man and woman everybody got that by God's grace okay so now uh just a little introduction there now the first church age Jesus applauded the Ephesians for testing the false prophets see the church the angel of the Church of Ephesus he says I know your Works your labor your patience and how you cannot bear them which are evil the church that's how we are we can't bear people that spread evil lies no we don't we don't go anti-christian on him and wish they died we pray for their repentance but there's a part of us that loves the word and anybody that's against the word we know is Antichrist amen right when they're honestly against the word we can't stand them which are evil and look this is what they did they tried them in other words they gave them the word test they said they were apostles but they're not and we and the Believers found them to be Liars they were lying about being apostle in other words today they're lying about me a message believer they're not really a message believer they're lying about being a Bible believer not really a Bible believer but how do they know they had to test them by the word of God the Bible didn't say test them by signs wonders and miracles although that's that's good it's good to have that the Bible said you tested them by the word of God prove all things search the Scriptures Daily praise God see and the the Believers born them they had patience and for my sake has labored and it's not fainted so we see the Christian Life in the Ephesian Church age was to labor be patient try people that say that exalt themselves as something great try them if they say there's something great and you'll find out by giving them in the word test are they truly an apostle or not an apostle Hallelujah the Bible said he that spiritual judges all things yet he himself is Judge of no man see nobody can judge you when the holy spirit's revealed to you the truth like our our stance on music or our stance on the baptism the Holy Ghost without sensation or our stance on uh modesty you know nobody can nobody can really judge us in other words their evil words don't hurt my feelings they can't judge me because I know it's the word of God has already been judged amen the word of God judges me praise God now the word of God has given me a liberty I know the word of God has given me direction praise God see spiritual men and women judge all things right and then we find some things are in the scripture most things you know most things we preach of course in the scripture but there are some areas of Liberty and if something's not in the scripture that's called an area of Christian Liberty praise God and there's there's a list of women my first book from 2019 I have a whole little section on there in chapter two of areas of Christian Liberty right some some of them deal with you know jewelry how much jewelry you wear uh wine how much wine you drink and where you drink wine uh there's numerous areas of Christian Liberty some of them are not coming to me right now but see a spiritual person will judge all things in other words you're I'll say like this every day we're giving ourselves the word test or we ought to be right give ourselves the word test prove yourself the Bible says prove your own selves praise God make your calling election sure now you're familiar with this scripture for the time is when you ought to be teachers and you have need that one teacher again to be the first principles of the Oracles of God and or become such as have need a milk and not a strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe now we saw that a few months ago that deals with every denomination they never go into the deep things of God they just fail to go into it most of them right so then they're bringing forth milk instead of meat to the people they have a Milky sermon God loves you you're forgiven say a sinner's prayer you're going to heaven all these milky things but they don't get down into the depths of situations like the government or black lives matter or drug abuse or the leaders uh your daily life the music you listen to the apps that you're into they don't get down into the real depths of a Christian Life your everyday walk with the Lord praise God rarely do they and they won't say anything against certain things like homosexuality or they won't say they won't say nothing against that because it's all milk but the Bible says they're unskillful in the word of God in other words they should be higher in the things of God they should be able to understand more but they don't because they're still drinking milk they haven't moved on to Christian maturity but strong meat belongs to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil praise God so when you can look at your daily life and say this is good for me this is evil for me praise God like there's some websites you see if you see it pretty some pretty bad ads popping up you should have discernment to stop going to that website right that's just one example or if you like a certain uh podcast we talk about podcasts you like a certain YouTube channel or if you like a certain thing and you start hearing cuss words all the time we should have enough discernment to start turning that out praise God I had to do that over the years different people I liked or followed and I can't follow them anymore because it's not helping my Christian walk I can see the fruits of their decisions right you can see the fruits but I'm Discerning I'm judging good and evil in my life it's just pointing me to Christ or is this pointing me to other carnal things of the world you see the preaching of the word should do that it should point us to the truth and then the Holy Spirit should convict each one of us the next day when we go study our Bible and search the Scriptures Daily praise God as you're a noble Christian the Holy Spirit should convict you this is either discernment of good or this is evil Hallelujah and that's a mature Christian walk now we're eating some meat now we're not just sucking on a straw or getting milk or drinking milk now we're shooting into something that's got some meat it's got some texture it's got some spice to it it's got some flavor praise God Amen it got some variety it tastes good praise God amen what would you think if I told Malachi okay tonight Malachi for supper we're just having milk tonight what would he say he'd probably he'd probably pass out no he's growing he needs some meat he needs something to stick to those ribs or whatever they say that's what you need you can't come to church and get a milk sermon you've got to get a meanie sermon praise God something that'll stick to you something that will fill you up praise God Hallelujah and then you ought to go in the morning and make sure it was right praise God tomorrow morning Hallelujah search it every day that's the only way like my dad told me the greatest lesson I know my dad has many faults I love him but the greatest lesson ever taught to me was my dad when he said you've got to know Jesus Christ so well that no man can deceive you and all these men face to face and all these people on phone calls all these people come to the church try to deceive me or all these emails and things I get none of it can move me because I know Jesus Christ more than they do praise God and it ain't exalted me it's just when you seek God you know him praise God he said open the door and I'll come in and fellowship with you praise God and when I've had fellowship with Jesus that much then no man can deceive me how many could say Amen to that when you have fellowship with Jesus nobody can deceive you because you were there when he showed you the truth it was an experience he pointed you to the word of God hallelujah he fed you on the word of God he get church he doesn't give us dead bread he gives us living bread praise God in other words you'll be just reading along and all of a sudden something will pop out and ah it's alive that's what it is I know that's what I've been looking for praise God Hallelujah that's right it's living bread like we looked at uh the fresh bread in the Holy place a number of weeks ago right now let's look at some quotes here so you won't maybe need your Bibles here I won't be turning too much in Bibles there are 17 quotes and as I was thinking about the sermon for this week of this thought came to me a couple of times about the word test Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Matthew 15. or 16 rather what kind of rock was it our mother Catholic Church said it was upon Peter The Rock if that's right he backs it a few days later the Protestant said it was built upon Jesus The Rock but let me tell you my version of it who does man say I am one said you're Elias one said Moses one said this to the other but who do you say but who do you say it isn't what somebody else says it's what we think it's what you say where's you what's your opinion of it God asked that question to every man here tonight what's your opinion of this thing that's going on is it with the word test it with the word Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God in other words tonight God is asking every person here and all those live streaming is this right or not test this by the word if Jesus asked Peter and he had the Keys of the Kingdom praise God he's going to ask all of us is it right or not praise God now in spoken word original C brother random as or says the word tests four times so this is the main sermon where he kind of labored on the word test and this was a combined six hours of sermons he preached in the morning I think four hours and two hours in the evening it's a six hour sermon series in one day he preached in six hours see Church you don't have it so bad you know there's no reason to complain I know you don't complain hey look he said look what kind of revivals they're having great revivals have had looks good doesn't it you say brother Brown now you got us on the limb that's where I wanted you so see there's going to times the holy spirit's gonna put you out on the limb you're out there it seems a little unstable what is he going to preach what is he going to say next and you're out there on the limb to see what you say about it what do you think about it you need to make a stand Jesus said what do you say who do you say like he told the disciples you want to go away too like there's going to be a work test for each one of us praise God yes we're strong yes we're stable but yet he's he allows us to go through tests and he puts you out on the limb what you gonna do you're out there on the limb don't feel safe don't feel so secure as you always do it's a word test but don't don't fret church God made a way that you can pass the test amen can't say like this brother William he gave you two wings to fly amen when you're out there on the way on the limb praise God if you fall he'll give you two Wings an Old Testament New Testament Spear and truth hallelujah he'll give you that to fly and you'll overcome so there's nothing up here for a Christian how are you going to know what's right or wrong give it the word test so there's revivals going around the message I've told you I think they're genuine revivals but there's a mixture in there of We're the greatest of all time so I give the Revival a word test well it looks like it looks like good signs good wonders good Miracles lies being changed but there's this attitude we're the greatest of all time amongst the preachers so I give it the word test you know some of the testimonies look good but I've got a I've got a little concern about the things that are being preached some of the things not all the things but just some of them see that's the way to tell whether it's right or wrong just give it the word test see what it says about the word any Spirit see what it says about the word if it denies the word it's not of God no matter what it is if it denies the word it's not of God look give it the words ask see what happens now church I want you to know tonight I'm not asking people for perfection because I'm not perfect Hallelujah William Brother William knows this brother Adam died and the church lady book came out and he still had in there he believed it was going to end by 77. God let him die with a human thought that wasn't right in other words you don't have to be perfect you don't have to know every answer but one thing you got to have you got to be saved and you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen that's one thing that you want praise God you want to know you're saved and you want to know that Christ lives in you praise God he just doesn't anoint you at times which we thank God for but he actually lives inside of you you see God you see your life on an upward angle not downward angle praise God I know you're ascending into spiritual things a life a life of Greater sacrifice a life of Greater Service A Life That's directing others you're going up to heaven you're saying follow my example and if you follow me then I'll lead you I'll lead you to Christ I'm going to heaven who will come along and go with me to my father's house amen come and go with me to my father's house is that that's what I'm going to be saying Jesus is the way to my father's house where there's joy joy joy come and go with me tomorrow see your your life is leaving a trail and people are going to follow it praise God says you never know your influence you parents you know the children are going to follow you right I got a promise he doesn't even follow me not guaranteed but I gotta I got a uh what is it called uh again the other word now when I preach that series probability I've got a strong probability if I've trained them up if my wife has trained them up then they will not leave the faith when they get older I got a strong possibility praise God by God's law of reaping and sowing Hallelujah see let's leave a testimony unless everybody see our life as ascending up towards heaven where marching to Zion beautiful beautiful Zion praise God no matter what if it denies the word it's not of God look give it the word test see what happens you say brother man don't you believe that Holy Ghost speaks in tongues yes sir but give it the word test now he's talking about the initial evidence here Janice and Jammers work miracles that's right didn't he yes sir Janice Jammers when Moses went down to Egypt everything that Moses done in the way of a sign Janice the Jammers them two witches could produce the same thing two Devils now no it's not everything right it was just the first two things out of the ten so there's another one I could use I there's another one that's not everywhere that I say the Lord see they could only impersonate or do the first two the first two uh signs or plagues see two Devils Moses would say please they'd say fleas Moses said a stick on the ground they said a stick on the ground a serpent a serpent that's right they could work miracles but the thing of it is how he's talking now to the Roman Catholic Church how can then she be a harlot why give her the word test that's how you know try your own the word once and see what she says oh of course we're taught in the Seminary them days it used to be that way but the way back in those days of Apostles that was only for the apostles only you so-called Church of Christ speak where the Bible speaks in silent well I'd like to hear you do some speaking now uh-huh no he says no he says this word you you be quiet God's word shuts everything up brother no man can brag that's right all her daughters are harlots how by the same as their Mammy committing the spiritual fornications against the word so Barbara says take the denominations and give them the word test right take the Catholic Church any nomination see that's why you left Glory because you gave your church the word test praise God you know something's different about the message something's different about that kind of preaching that's preaching I've never heard before that's how I knew this message was right the first sermon I heard was Sovereign seed and I never heard a man preach like that praise God it was God it was the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking through the word of God I heard the voice of God the Revelation was clear and I knew it was truth it reached out into my soul it touched my soul praise God amen Hallelujah it was the word test Hallelujah it's the word test all it took of many of us the first time we heard it it just changed our lives now not all of us but many of us that was some of our first experiences where God just reached out into your heart revealed himself like the Bible said with Lydia God open your heart aren't you glad your heart wasn't closed but your heart opened to the things of God I receive it I want more of it see you passed the word test he give you a plus praise God you passed the test Hallelujah you received the word of God tonight Hallelujah now here's a good quote too now with thousands of signed workers in the last day they've created a generation of sign Seekers that knows no more nothing about the true move of God and his word in these last days isn't that the truth so many people just want Miracles but they don't know anything about the word of God give them blood and oil and fleshy demonstrations on the platform they'll support it whether it's God's word or not whether it's scripture or Not Jesus have warned us such things at the end time Matthew 24 2 spirits very close alike deceive the very elected impossible Church don't go to sleep on this don't go to sleep on this remember I did that series on false prophets last year they now invite the people up and they don't say you have to speak in tongues they just say you need some something to happen on you and evil spirits come on that's closer than what it was before before it was you got to speak in tongues you got to speak that became far away but the enemy got more deceptive he said well you need a refreshinger you need a refilling and who knows what could happen and they put these demon spirits on the people and they shake and they they scream in pain it's it's awful I don't know if I ever showed you that one I don't know but it's getting more deceptive church now that's a denomination we'll you know we'll we'll see or the charismatic Movement we know they're way out the word of God but what about when it comes close to the message praise God it's getting closer and closer all the time right like the like the tape Church movement is so close because we believe God sent a prophet we believe there's nothing on the tapes we believe all those things and that's so close to the truth but then when they say every word that is so wrong praise God and yet they've had people raised from the dead supposedly in their services we'll give them the word test do they say with the word of God not all the time so we stay away from those lies praise God but it's going to be so close it may deceive the very left everywhere possible it ain't possible though to deceive you and I that's one thing Lord that ain't possible praise God Satan might trick me and get me in a trap he might catch me to snare but by the grace of God I'm coming out of that praise God Amen because I cannot say deceived that long praise God I could not be in sin that long because there's a promise God's children cannot be enslaved praise God God's children are Overcomers amen that's what he said to he that overcomes amen that's what the rewards are for those people that overcome the devil praise God they can't be kept entrapped they're Eagles praise God they've got to fly they got their flying eels they've got to rise up in this hour they've got to come out of Earthly things they've got to be Heavenly Birds amen how can you tell them give them the word test how can you know it speak the word see church we have to argue we have to be anything like that just speak the word see what they say to speak the word see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they have no germ seed in them they are of the evil one and deceive you as the first bride was the seed and the second bride was deceived they're deceivers of the third bride by hybriding the word or trying to God never placed signs I love this quote God never plays signs above the word and the church said I saw the film like ma where's this quote been praise God I feel like I hadn't read it in a while oh that's beautiful amen God never does that praise God God never placed signs ahead of his word that's a scorcher God never play signs that is the word they were added for proof of the word but the word is first Jesus said if you can't believe my words believe me because of the works right so we see that too his work spoke but Jesus also said you know my doctrines from God because you'll do their will you'll do the will of God and then you'll know that it's God in other words I can tell Austin Lena as early Believers if you do this God will do this and they'll know my Doctrine is right or they'll know the preacher Doctrine is right because if they approach god with the same Faith the same promises they'll get the same results ah hallelujah praise God now it might not come at the right time and season or when we think it should but if you if you trust God if you believe God then God's word will back itself up praise God will back his word up Hallelujah and he the scripture for that where's the scripture for that brother Jesse it's in First Kings 17 or 18 if I'm not mistaken Elijah told the woman the widow woman bake me a cake first then watch the miracle happen come to the word first then watch the miracle the seed word itself is what the Holy Spirit energizes so you've got to receive the letter first can I say like that you got to receive the spoken word the word of God first and then the holy spirit will make this word live praise God but let me say let me say like this though when you hear him believe it that's the Living Word too praise God right your soul receives a Living Word the spiritual food but then God will also do Supernatural signs wonders and miracles to let you know this message is Right praise God and the message is the Bible verses like brothers said in the Rapture message uh December 5th 1965. brother Adam said you hear these Brethren talk about the mess what is the message it's the scriptures that God is scripturally vindicating right now it's the promised word the promised Bible verses of the hour amen that's the real definition of the message it's the Bible verses that God's fulfilling right now Hallelujah it's not every human thought a brother random or human thought of Billy Paul or Joseph Branham it's the Bible verses that God's fulfilling right now praise God Hallelujah I got about 50 quotes brother says the message is the message is that brother William you probably heard it the message is Hebrews 13 8. the message is Malachi 4 5 and 6. I mean there's like 50 of them there's and what is it those are all the scriptures that God's doing right now praise God that's what the message is praise God one place he said my message is justification sanctification baptism of the Holy that's the word of God Amen that's the word for this hour praise God but people say message and they'll think tapes or message of my opinions you know they think they they mix that in there and that's where they get off but see give it the word test and you'll see what's right give it the word test does God tell a lie does God have to apologize or anything does God ever get numbers mixed up no I don't have to apologize to anybody and yeah brother man will repeatedly apologize I'm sorry about this which was good that's a humble Christian thing to do but he wasn't Jesus was Jesus in him yes but Jesus and you too praise God he's a prophet we're no prophets but now if the prophet's gone then the Holy Spirit the move is on the broad amen Hallelujah brother Adam said the spirit the bride and the prophet will all say the same thing and everything they say will be already found in the word of God hallelujah hallelujah see a lot of these people are not saying what brother Brandon said or what the Bible says how do we know all right brother Austin because what we say is in the word of God hallelujah amen that makes us right but you got to give it the word test you've got to speak and just speak the word see what they say about the word now remember I'm not asking for Perfection but I'm asking for humility right we're asking for humility like I love I love Paul and Peter Peter Peter was you know uh discriminating and Paul goes right up and brother said he stuck his finger under his nose and says you're the guilty man and he humbled himself now Church which of us would humble himself now bear with me Malachi but what if I put my finger under his nose what if I put my finger under you guys knows what we I said you're wrong about would you say oh thanks brother Jess or would you say nobody talks to me like that don't get your finger out of my face now I'm not saying Paul actually did that but he went face to face and said you're wrong about this you're to be blamed and what if I went up to you and said you're to be blamed it's your fault do you still love me but that's what the Holy Spirit did in Paul through Peter he gave him the word test my church I'm not looking at you and your mistakes I'm not trying to point out anybody's mistakes here because we all have mistakes about making the point how many of us could receive correction how many of us would pass the word test if someone come brought us the word of God now hoping we would pass it by God's grace Hallelujah so remember signs are never placed ahead of God's word now brother man another place says uh there's a voice to the signs and so so sometimes God will do Miracles or signs but then you got to hang around you got to believe the sign but then listen to what the voice says afterwards that's what Moses Moses had two signs so he got Israel's attention he got Egypt's attention but you had to stay around and listen for the voice what did the message say let my people go well how many Saints would say would say Amen to that give it the word I believe that but it didn't happen right away you had to hang around think about that Moses day even though you saw these Miracles it got harder to be a believer they started complaining against Moses you're making life harder for us see the devil always give you something to complain about but let's choose not to complain Hallelujah life may get harder right but listen to the look at the signs and listen to the voice of God listen to the word of God because the word of God will ultimately set you free Hallelujah it's for a test it's fourth season how can you tell brother bam what's right or wrong give him the word test that'll tell whether they're right or wrong or not say right with the word see see what happens just throw the word down there and see where that I like that just I'm not going to throw this but just throw it down there see where they're at just throw it down there all you gotta do is lay out the word of God well the Bible says fathers it's an Holy Ghost but then Jesus said ten days or Peter said 10 days later Lord Jesus Christ you see where they're at just give him the word test oh every words thou saith the Lord well where's the Bible say uh Enoch lived for 500 years where the bible say that there's a quote in 1965 a month before brother died he said if people are going to die and go to an eternal hell I got to go brother I had to listen to it it's just a slip of the tongue what's up with the tongue right you're made of 80 percent water and petroleum if petroleum it's it's diesel fluid diesel fuel uh it can also make gasoline and kerosene if you get any of that in any living thing it dies always thus saith the Lord we'll give them the word test okay then you'll be the first one to drink this gallon of petroleum and I'll be ready to call 9-1-1 as soon as you take your first sip they're going to pump your stomach right see just lay just lay the word out there just lay it out there and they'll manifest what they're aren't you glad you're saying hallelujah the word of God takes away every Veil amen the word of God strips it all down all these masks all these uh confusion all this Darkness the word of God scatters all there and you see what's laying behind there praise God is that a Believer or not a Believer give him the word test oh then get right away then yeah just stay right with that word so if they give Makai the word test he proved out he was 100 with it had 400 prophets all saying ahab's going to go up Ahab is going to conquer he's going to come back and Makai is the only one that said you go up there and you're going to die who was right the 400 or the one the one who stayed with what Elijah said the dogs will lick his bones is that right lick his blood rather see who's right most the time it's not the majority we saw that in the 2020 election all those charismatics that Trump's going to get in he has two two consecutive terms the Lord showed me the Lord didn't show them nothing they were all wrong they had a 50 chance to get it and they had four years to guess it and they couldn't find the mind of God to get get it right with a 50 chance I didn't see anybody get it right another man so what good what good would do you anyway to guess the president what good would do you it's a 50 chance you're gonna get it right anyway that's nothing Supernatural when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost and say you got the Holy Ghost and then deny God's word say you believed and received the Holy Ghost then deny that the word is true then how can that be the Holy Ghost when he was the one that wrote the Bible the Holy Ghost deny his own words say I was wrong you're right no that ain't God no sir sharp sword Lord send us a great message that's what we're looking for then of course when he comes to fix those stones to cut them out to stand for the building what will happen many of them won't stand for the word test they'll love their organization better than they love the word although the word be Vindicated by that man he'll be a prophet that will come in the name of the Lord and he'll be the one that will come upon the earth I believe it oh everybody says it'll be a group of people I want somebody to show me the Bible where it'll be a group of people God would break his own word he can't do that no sir he promises it'll be one man now this is speaking of Revelation 10 7. there's one man there's one seventh angel that the mystery of God is finished through that was God's Prophet brother Brandon it's not going to be a group that's going to finish the mystery of God brother Brown finished the mystery of God you can't do that no sir it'll be one man and then there'll be others with him how many with him tonight that's you and I said you could say amen that's okay to say Amen I'm not trying to I'm not trying to put anybody on a limb now he says of course thousands the whole Church Believers will be with him everywhere even in Akron Ohio praise God they'll be with that one man that one Prophet who restores the word of God back to its original condition now Jesus come and brought the test oh do you know that Jesus brought the word test how many knew that by God's grace his word test was search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify me wow so the word test According To Jesus and Paul is will you search the scriptures to make sure it's right could they stand the test would those Pharisees look in the word and say oh yes Jesus was born in Bethlehem oh yes a star of David did rise the star of Star of David did rise star would rise out of Bethlehem did they really search that out though to the Pharisees inside you see search that out friends they didn't bother to search the scriptures now he's talking about a foundation it's cracked water broke it won't stand the test oh man then be sent to the scrap Heap God always has counted character Glory instead of numbers I didn't plan to put that there but that sure gets a hearty amen for me praise God hallelujah It Ain't So Much the numbers it's the character of the people those who can pass the word test now listen closely he says now when the word just came then went they went over and seen the opposition I was talking about Israel crossing over he said they seen that amalekites was 10 times their size now we look like grasshoppers they're fences they're cities so so uh so walled till they can run a chair race around at two chariots as hard as they can go around the wall see their cities why their Spears are way out they're alone and there are giants why we look like grasshoppers we can't do it and two men passed the word test Joshua and Caleb wait a minute he says two million people shut up just a minute we're more than able to do it see we're more than a match for them hallelujah how many believe we're more than a match for every demon coming out of hell today we're more than a match we don't have to fear nothing praise God with the fear nuclear war we have to fear the second round of covet 2.0 we don't got to Bear anything we've

coven most of us did right but you know but we got through it praise God it's nothing to fear we can pass the word test if we want to what was they basing on God said see what do you base what do you base your word test on I'm basing it on what God already promised what God promised me not my thoughts about what God promised me but what did God promise you and I I've given you the land it's yours

heaven all spiritual gifts about the Bible says all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus so we can claim those my there's 40 minutes okay let me see how close I am here and where they stood but the people had gotten married off amongst other things all kinds of Creeds and rituals among them just weak heat weaky wishy washy Wiki among them they've just he they didn't know which way to turn to do that's right there come the word test yeah he grants now look look how God is gracious yet he grants you permission to make permit your will a permissive will what's in your heart he knows it see God knew almost all the two million would not have enough courage to go over so God was gracious he said you can have your choice I'm not going to force anybody to take the land all those who believe and
