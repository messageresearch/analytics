[9:25] let's go ahead and get our bibles out if
[9:26] we can
[9:28] uh so glad to
[9:30] be here
[9:31] this is a home which god has called me
[9:34] uh to be actually have a part of the
[9:37] ministry
[9:39] um for those who didn't know uh you know
[9:41] brother jesse that's my brother
[9:43] uh in the flesh and uh
[9:46] lord let his gift just really come
[9:47] around right off the gate this is decay
[9:49] or what 17 15 some some odds some years
[9:53] ago
[9:54] he's been pastoring here but you know
[9:56] just just to bless you if you never
[9:58] heard it but uh anyway um
[10:00] god knows where you know we all kind of
[10:02] come out of lima area there and you know
[10:04] the lord actually used brother jesse to
[10:06] start a ministry here and uh you know by
[10:09] god's grace i stayed in lima you know
[10:12] being from that area
[10:14] and anyway what happened was
[10:17] a new pastor had set in there and and
[10:19] one day one day uh they wanted me to
[10:21] take a use pretty much almost like a
[10:23] youth pastor position in the church
[10:24] there
[10:25] and i was praying and uh something
[10:28] something struck me and it said
[10:31] you're not staying here you're going to
[10:32] brother jesse's church
[10:34] and this is just right off the you know
[10:36] right off the get with the new pastor
[10:38] i'm like okay i got i got this youth
[10:40] thing that you know it's been offered to
[10:41] me and god you want me to go to brother
[10:43] jesse's and brother jesse's church was
[10:45] two and a half hours away it still is
[10:47] [Laughter]
[10:49] and uh anyway um god told me that and so
[10:53] i'm like oh boy i gotta call this this
[10:55] brother and i gotta let them know that
[10:58] that i gotta leave the church i got to
[11:00] leave the church and anyway so what
[11:02] happened was i i called him that morning
[11:03] he said god bless your brother and
[11:05] uh i said uh i said yeah god bless you
[11:08] too and i said i said you know um the
[11:11] reason why i called you this morning he
[11:12] said yeah and uh said maybe about the
[11:15] youth position i said yeah yeah it's
[11:17] kind of about that and i i said uh you
[11:20] know i i was praying about it and the
[11:22] holy spirit come and told me to go to
[11:24] brother jesse's church and not to take
[11:26] your position i'm so you know i'm just
[11:28] really sorry about that and he said
[11:29] brother he said that's so strange and i
[11:31] said why is that
[11:33] he said this morning i woke up and i was
[11:35] i was at the table
[11:37] drinking coffee with my wife and he said
[11:39] brother cam he said it was a nothing
[11:41] preconceived he said i was just drinking
[11:43] my coffee i set my cup cup down and he's
[11:45] like something just rolled through my
[11:46] mouth and said brother cam needs to go
[11:49] to brother jesse's church
[11:54] and he said he said
[11:56] god is my witness he said it rolled
[11:58] right out of my mouth
[12:00] he said so i have no hesitancy about
[12:02] what you're doing
[12:04] he said go ahead and go brother
[12:06] and you know what uh by god's grace i
[12:08] sat under this ministry for two years i
[12:10] grew much
[12:12] i wish i could have grown closer to my
[12:14] brother's abilities and and so forth
[12:16] there he's just a mighty man of god i
[12:19] feel very blessed uh to have him as a
[12:21] natural brother
[12:23] but i tell you that because even part of
[12:24] the ministry i've been pastoring what 12
[12:26] 13 years almost however it is i can't
[12:28] remember that's how long it's been
[12:30] so my memory obviously cuts off right
[12:32] about 10 years somewhere right in there
[12:34] but anyway by god's grace um you know
[12:38] god spent i spent two of the finest
[12:41] years of my
[12:42] of my uh mentoring
[12:44] uh through uh the pastoring of your
[12:46] pastor so um it was phenomenal to me uh
[12:49] it's growth uh that i i can't uh take
[12:52] for granted so i love your your pastor
[12:55] here and my natural and spiritual
[12:57] brother and uh by god's grace i haven't
[13:00] done anything from that point but see a
[13:02] living god and and
[13:04] i don't know if i'll testify at some
[13:06] point in time but i have seen so much i
[13:08] know that this message is right
[13:10] i know that that there is a real devil
[13:13] and there's a real jesus christ
[13:16] and beyond a shadow of a doubt i'm i'm
[13:18] convinced that uh we're called to make
[13:20] this amen
[13:21] so uh by the grace of god if we could
[13:24] let's open up our bibles to joshua 3 10.
[13:28] i'm a little bit different of a preacher
[13:31] um
[13:32] perhaps i
[13:33] i'm kind of a teacher preacher and uh
[13:36] but uh i am i'm yielded to the
[13:38] inspiration of the holy ghost so
[13:39] whatever is on your heart just remember
[13:41] he's in this room amen and what is
[13:43] actually happening right now because of
[13:45] your worship you know the scripture says
[13:47] that that oh god thou that inhabits the
[13:49] praise of israel
[13:51] with the praise that you've brought i
[13:53] felt god when i when i was coming out of
[13:55] this room he is in this room
[13:57] so that means all things are possible
[14:00] tonight amen
[14:01] so whatever is on your heart now it's
[14:04] for you to realize that he is here and
[14:08] you want to make that known from your
[14:10] heart
[14:11] what you need amen so while the word is
[14:14] going forward it should be on your heart
[14:16] god i know you're here oh god meet the
[14:18] needs that i have amen and if you can
[14:21] get into that mindset amen if you can
[14:24] produce that type of an atmosphere then
[14:27] there won't be one person sick walk
[14:28] walking out of this room amen because
[14:30] that's the real message because the
[14:33] message is jesus christ amen
[14:36] amen
[14:37] so
[14:39] how we doing here
[14:40] joshua 3 10 then we're going to hebrews
[14:42] 12 after that
[14:45] there we go
[14:50] joshua 3 10
[14:53] it says here it says and joshua said
[14:56] hereby ye shall know that the living god
[14:59] is among you and that he will
[15:01] without
[15:03] fail drive out from before you the
[15:06] canaanites and the hittites and the
[15:08] hivites and the perizzites and the
[15:10] gurgashites and the amorites and the
[15:13] jebusites all right
[15:15] somehow that word jebusite got
[15:17] emboldened and underlined but we have a
[15:20] reason for that hebrews 12 18 next amen
[15:28] really excited today and lord he just
[15:30] kind of brought me around i uh with so
[15:32] much to preach and uh so little time to
[15:34] do it um
[15:36] we just try to find the mind of god and
[15:37] this is where we ended up and uh i'm so
[15:40] glad that uh you know even amongst our
[15:42] brother's family there that now he has
[15:44] his own little zion amen uh hebrews 12
[15:47] 18 it says but ye are come unto mount
[15:51] sion
[15:52] and unto the city of the living god the
[15:55] heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable
[15:58] company of angels
[16:00] to the general assembly and the chur and
[16:03] church of the firstborn which are
[16:05] written in heaven and to god the judge
[16:08] of all
[16:10] and the spirits of just men made perfect
[16:14] all right now we know that there in that
[16:17] passage i'm just reading it to bring to
[16:19] you mount zion obviously this right here
[16:21] is working with the spiritual tense of a
[16:24] spiritual zion that the church was
[16:25] moving into there he said you've already
[16:26] come unto it uh but yet we're gonna
[16:29] learn a little bit about these things or
[16:30] perhaps be refreshed by some thoughts uh
[16:32] let's bow our heads for a word of prayer
[16:34] and we'll get right to this thought the
[16:36] lord jesus christ oh god you who are in
[16:39] our midst
[16:40] the great god of all creation
[16:42] oh god it was you
[16:44] that
[16:45] by your hand all the heavens and the
[16:48] earth consist o god just one little move
[16:51] out of your hand o god and everything
[16:52] would be completely out of cater lord
[16:54] but lord you hold the moon the stars the
[16:57] earth everything in a perfect order and
[17:00] yet oh god
[17:01] we are yearning oh god for something
[17:04] else to come into order tonight god that
[17:06] is the house of the living god lord
[17:09] where it's so important that if one
[17:12] person were out of cater in that room
[17:14] god it could stop divine healing because
[17:16] stop deliverance it could stop the
[17:18] movement of the holy ghost but yet
[17:20] tonight god we're longing for your
[17:22] spirit which is in this room to put in
[17:25] order oh god put us in a heavenly
[17:28] atmosphere oh god set us in heavenly
[17:30] places and we're asking o god tonight
[17:34] that you just move on every heart in
[17:36] such a way oh god lord thou knowest
[17:39] where i
[17:40] have felt led to bring this o god by
[17:43] your spirit but yet lord your spirit can
[17:45] order it and put it right where it needs
[17:47] to be so i ask oh god i give you a heed
[17:50] o god and and put you at the helm of
[17:52] this service lord i don't want nothing
[17:54] here i don't want my mind i want your i
[17:56] want your mind to speak through o god to
[17:59] a group o god who have moved past their
[18:01] minds o god to allow you to be
[18:03] preeminent in this place god so we're
[18:06] asking o god that lord lord it's a
[18:08] saturday night but lord what better
[18:10] could we do on a saturday night then
[18:12] though god to hear your word to invite
[18:14] you here oh god to worship you what more
[18:16] could we want
[18:18] we just ask now lord that you just come
[18:20] and have your way
[18:22] take a hold o god and bring great
[18:24] blessings to your church here for the
[18:26] glory in jesus christ's name the church
[18:28] says together amen you may be seated
[18:36] a little thought the lord has brought to
[18:38] me uh this evening i i ministered
[18:40] several sermons on this tonight we just
[18:42] feel that to come this direction and uh
[18:44] i pray that you're you're in victory
[18:46] mode amen and uh
[18:49] if not we'll begin to go through some of
[18:51] these thoughts for you uh tonight we
[18:53] want to work with the showdown for
[18:55] stronghold zion all right the the
[18:58] showdown for stronghold zion and uh if
[19:02] we could we want to entitle this i
[19:05] haven't went this direction before uh
[19:07] defeating the last enemy all right
[19:10] uh the showdown for stronghold zion
[19:11] defeating the last enemy all right so we
[19:14] want to work in our bibles here and i'm
[19:16] going to try to go fast because uh uh i
[19:19] don't want to be too long here uh but uh
[19:21] psalms 132 13
[19:24] and uh just looking now into this zion
[19:27] you know the bible especially
[19:30] extensively in the old testament talks
[19:32] about zion all right and uh
[19:35] maybe while i say zion somebody back
[19:37] there look to me that little sweet face
[19:39] amen
[19:40] but uh we understand that uh god talks
[19:43] all about this zion but why this zion
[19:47] and uh what is the bible trying to tell
[19:50] us about his plan for zion all right now
[19:54] notice here in psalms 132 13 it says for
[19:58] the lord hath chosen zion all right
[20:03] god's choosing is zion now why didn't he
[20:06] say gilgal why didn't he say uh
[20:10] some of the other cities bethlehem or
[20:12] bethel or any of these but he actually
[20:14] says the lord chose zion
[20:17] there must be something very important
[20:20] about zion oh my it says he hath desired
[20:23] it for his habitation all right notice
[20:27] his habitation that means that he has
[20:29] inhabited it right so god wanted zion so
[20:33] that he could live there amen hallelujah
[20:37] oh in a natural sense david is bringing
[20:41] this out but not noticing that it will
[20:44] come forth in a spiritual manner upon a
[20:48] spiritual people oh my but seeing this
[20:51] he says this is my rest forever amen
[20:56] here will i dwell for i have desired it
[21:01] amen
[21:03] so
[21:03] the psalmist david coming under the
[21:06] inspiration of the holy ghost we unders
[21:10] that that were coming upon david as he
[21:12] was moved by the holy ghost writing his
[21:14] music amen i mean god still prophesies
[21:18] through his music amen we know in the
[21:20] bible that was that david he just didn't
[21:22] prophesy here but he could cast off
[21:25] demons off of saul through the worship
[21:28] amen hallelujah it's a way to look at
[21:32] worship brother sister as you are saying
[21:34] i will hasten amen he as you are
[21:37] hastening to him he himself will come he
[21:41] can drive a devil out of your life he
[21:43] can drive it out of your neighbor he can
[21:45] make an atmosphere so precious amen that
[21:48] he will move upon you to deliver you
[21:51] from your adversary amen you know those
[21:54] little devils how they try to sneak up
[21:56] on you they try to get that hold on you
[21:59] and once you got them there remember the
[22:01] revelation is that when the devil brings
[22:04] something your way
[22:06] what are you supposed to do
[22:08] your prophet said he's actually bringing
[22:10] you
[22:10] the devil's bling bringing you a box of
[22:13] rattlesnakes
[22:15] he's delivering you some rattlesnakes
[22:19] he said what do you do
[22:20] he said if somebody showed up at your
[22:22] house with a box of rattlesnakes you
[22:26] actually have the right when they knock
[22:28] on that door to give you the package
[22:31] you have the right to say i'm not
[22:34] wanting this i didn't order this it just
[22:37] come to me
[22:38] i'm going to return this to the sender
[22:41] amen
[22:43] hallelujah anytime the devil tries to
[22:46] put something off on you you rebuke him
[22:48] in the name of jesus christ
[22:51] hallelujah say no i don't have to do
[22:54] this amen i don't have to live with this
[22:58] hallelujah

[24:08] christ not in the name of cam smith not
[24:11] in your name not anybody's name not in
[24:13] the name of father son holy ghost in the
[24:15] name of jesus christ amen

[24:22] savior the anointed amen he's there to
[24:25] save you amen
[24:27] any time now brother sister when he gave
[24:30] that attribute

[24:33] jesus christ wanted to call himself by
[24:35] an attribute
[24:36] what do you call himself
[24:38] why didn't he call himself jehovah jireh
[24:43] he could have called himself we could
[24:45] have said what whatever you say because
[24:47] you know jesus means to have a savior
[24:50] i don't know what the interpretation in
[24:51] english would have been for jeopardy but
[24:53] what if he would have called to him that
[24:55] would mean that he was trying to express
[24:57] that he would always provide for you
[25:03] when he named himself jesus
[25:08] he is actually identifying that when you
[25:11] call on your name you're calling upon a
[25:14] savior amen
[25:15] [Music]
[25:17] hallelujah el shaddai the breasted god
[25:20] right he was wounded for your
[25:22] transgressions bruised for your
[25:24] iniquities and by his stripes you're
[25:26] healed amen
[25:28] you have the right to pull whatever
[25:31] spiritual need you have or what other
[25:33] physical need you have for him
[25:38] hallelujah that means right now amen you
[25:41] call on the name
[25:43] it's not a joke it's not a gimmick
[25:45] you're releasing jehovah's savior from
[25:48] your mouth
[25:51] oh i've been feeling sick
[25:53] jesus
[25:54] how many times you heard testimonies
[25:56] people they've cried out jesus
[25:59] and all of a sudden if someone's trying
[26:01] to hurt him
[26:02] something happens
[26:03] they're in a car and they're gonna die
[26:05] something happens
[26:08] hallelujah my grandpa 50 years ago he
[26:11] was he he had a lead foot he was driving
[26:14] up this hill or whatever and the semi's
[26:16] there he went to go past semi there was
[26:18] another vehicle coming straight at him

[26:23] hands up said jesus
[26:27] and i'm i'm here me and brother jess

[26:29] right he said when he did that
[26:32] he said all he remembers is raising his
[26:35] head up he was on the side of the road
[26:36] and the vehicle's past
[26:40] you see all your needs whatever it is if

[27:05] jesus amen
[27:07] and when you call on that name he is
[27:10] nigh to them that fear him

[27:16] but where we're going you'll find out
[27:18] when you call on the name of jesus
[27:21] you're not just calling on his attribute
[27:24] you're calling on your husband
[27:26] [Laughter]
[27:29] you know
[27:30] if my wife cries out for help
[27:36] i hate to say this but sister who you
[27:37] might not be as quick as
[27:39] her husband
[27:41] hallelujah
[27:43] right
[27:44] right sister lydia my she might be quick
[27:47] she probably ain't a big quiz husband
[27:49] because that's the way that relationship
[27:51] works
[27:52] hallelujah i looked out the door the
[27:54] other day at church or somewhere talking
[27:55] to my wife
[27:57] and i just seen her out there i didn't
[27:58] know who it was and i just ran to it
[28:02] i said what's going on i need to go
[28:04] that's my wife
[28:07] hallelujah before she called i was
[28:10] already on my way to help her amen
[28:14] sometimes god is on his way already he's
[28:18] waiting on you to call him on the scene
[28:21] amen
[28:24] hallelujah
[28:26] hallelujah
[28:27] this ain't built on big crowds this
[28:30] gospel ain't built
[28:32] on big giant strobe lights and smoke
[28:36] this gospel is the good news of jesus
[28:40] christ for god so loved the world that
[28:42] he gave his only begotten son that
[28:44] whosoever believeth on him shall not
[28:48] perish but have everlasting life
[28:53] now notice this
[28:55] so he's talking about this zion
[28:57] and he says i
[28:58] will abundantly
[29:00] bless her provision
[29:03] he's going to live with he's going to
[29:04] live there
[29:06] that's going to be his place of
[29:07] habitation and rest
[29:09] it was zion that he desired
[29:13] and he's always going to bless your
[29:15] provision
[29:17] it don't matter it doesn't matter if our
[29:19] government's coming
[29:20] cutting supplies off
[29:22] it doesn't matter who tries to cut it
[29:23] off
[29:24] they might cut it off from man but it
[29:27] can't cut it off from the bride amen
[29:30] because what your husband he want he
[29:33] owns the cattle of a thousand hill amen
[29:36] the bible said that what he never seen
[29:39] his seed forsaken nor his seed begging
[29:42] bread amen
[29:44] hallelujah that's a promise brother
[29:46] sister it don't matter how what the
[29:48] cupboards might get bear just cry out
[29:51] like that widow as hell fast amen
[29:54] hallelujah because the meal and the oil
[29:56] will not go dry
[30:00] notice even with the widow of zach what
[30:02] was it
[30:04] elijah was going to sustain her until
[30:07] the rain
[30:10] hallelujah god is going to pour the rain
[30:13] out amen it is thus saith the lord by
[30:16] the word of god
[30:19] it's a harvest ring but that widow
[30:21] needed what she needed provision before
[30:24] the rain
[30:28] don't you see what's going to happen
[30:30] as these things are getting worse and
[30:32] worse in this country around the world
[30:36] god is going to identify and vindicate
[30:39] a gentile widow of zarephath who is dead
[30:42] to her first husband the denomination
[30:46] amen
[30:47] the denominational spirit amen
[30:51] she was dead to the nicolaitan spirit
[30:54] she was so dead to the nicolaitan spirit
[30:58] that god could send a vindicated
[31:00] prophet's message to her
[31:02] and it would provide
[31:04] not the pr
[31:05] affair
[31:07] it's god himself amen
[31:12] hallelujah
[31:16] hallelujah back to my nephew
[31:23] hallelujah no i'm not gonna play the
[31:25] piano
[31:26] but i want to
[31:28] i feel like i could amen i feel like i
[31:31] can worship god in every language he's
[31:33] ever allowed to come forth and then god
[31:35] give me a heavenly language because
[31:37] that's not enough amen
[31:42] god wants this zion for his habitation
[31:45] zion is a in definition there's a few
[31:48] different ones because zion is a very
[31:50] mysterious word
[31:51] zion is a defense
[31:53] a fortress
[31:55] it literally means the fortified
[31:57] fortified place or stronghold
[32:02] so god was actually looking to a place
[32:05] that would be a stronghold
[32:09] it would be a place that what
[32:12] he would be able to be fortified there
[32:16] hallelujah takes you right back to
[32:18] revelations 5 where that lamb come and
[32:20] took the book and he was ordained with
[32:22] seven horns on his head
[32:26] those seven horns were watched seven
[32:29] church ages amen they were called horns
[32:32] because they were a defense to the
[32:34] animal amen
[32:35] that is the bride of jesus christ
[32:41] she amen the stronghold of god right now
[32:43] it's not based on how big your church is
[32:46] it's not based on how anointed your
[32:48] preacher is everybody in the church is
[32:50] anointed by this holy ghost
[32:53] hallelujah he wants you amen he's not
[32:56] interested in some sort of a nicolaitan
[32:59] move where it's just one anointed man
[33:01] the whole church needs to get yielded to
[33:04] the holy ghost
[33:06] get in position
[33:08] because that's what's slowing it down
[33:10] god wants you
[33:12] he wants you to get busy praying
[33:14] he wants you to get consecrated
[33:18] just reading quote where brother
[33:19] branstad he said why are these meetings
[33:21] happening like this
[33:22] i can't remember one brother's name he
[33:23] said he said that brother and gene goat
[33:25] he said they're praying and fasting days
[33:28] and days on end
[33:29] he said that's where it's coming
[33:33] they were actually doing the unmerited
[33:35] thing
[33:36] nobody knew about it
[33:38] but there they were staying consecrated
[33:40] before god god come out of bride of
[33:43] christ fellowship and acronym they were
[33:46] crying out that god would live in this
[33:49] place
[33:50] if a soul comes in
[33:52] let the holy ghost move like that amen
[33:58] hallelujah
[34:00] all right
[34:01] let's go for another one
[34:02] psalms 48.
[34:04] you know i'm gonna get moving a second
[34:05] here it says a psalm a song it in psalm
[34:08] for the sons of korah
[34:09] great is the lord and greatly to be
[34:13] praised in the city of our god
[34:16] in the mountain of his
[34:19] hallelujah
[34:22] it's a mountain of holiness
[34:28] so it's going to be a church that's on
[34:29] the highway of
[34:33] it's holiness to be our church that's
[34:34] living by the word
[34:38] now hallelujah that's why we've got to
[34:39] get in the book brother sister
[34:41] we've got to see what the bible says
[34:44] there's too many people that have cut
[34:46] too much out amen the bible is full and
[34:49] it what the truth will set you free when
[34:52] you give yourself to it amen
[34:58] so he says beautiful for situation
[35:03] the joy of the whole earth
[35:06] the joy of the whole earth
[35:08] i thought that was new york city
[35:13] nope
[35:14] some sweet people there
[35:18] is mount zion
[35:20] on the sides of the north remember that
[35:23] what does that stand for intimacy
[35:27] the city of the great king god is known
[35:30] in her palaces for a refuge
[35:34] amen
[35:35] so now another characteristic is coming
[35:38] forth
[35:39] that design is actually what
[35:42] god has known in her palaces
[35:46] i'm going somewhere with this yes
[35:48] because something something in our mind
[35:50] it would like to say that you know zion
[35:52] this dying that but i want to just set
[35:54] it forth in your mind what god's
[35:56] original idea was about this
[35:59] hallelujah now notice so it's palaces
[36:03] wait did it say temple
[36:08] it's analysis
[36:10] what's the difference between a temple
[36:12] and a palace
[36:18] and notice it's a palaces there's
[36:20] palaces for refuge
[36:24] ah just like in the old testament where
[36:26] there's what seven cities of refuge
[36:29] the sixth city in the last was christ
[36:31] right
[36:32] that's where the levites were that's
[36:34] where the word was amen and it didn't
[36:37] matter what come your way you could have
[36:39] accidentally murdered something wicked
[36:41] you could go to that city of refuge and
[36:44] find safety there
[36:46] now god is calling this zion a place of
[36:49] refuge
[36:51] but he identifies it as palaces
[36:55] all right
[36:58] all right now we know this i'm going to
[36:59] read this real quick because isaiah 4. i
[37:00] put that in parentheses not trying to
[37:02] ruin a quote it says in that day
[37:04] shall the branch of the lord be
[37:05] beautiful and glorious the fruit of the
[37:07] earth shall be excellent calmly them
[37:10] that escaped of israel
[37:12] how that you escaped all that damnation
[37:16] we're in a rapture our we're getting
[37:18] ready to leave damnation behind
[37:21] because the tribulation is when judgment
[37:23] is pouring out
[37:24] god is giving everyone a chance to wake
[37:27] up right now
[37:29] your fortification is not in a being a
[37:31] member of a church
[37:32] it's not in paying your tithes
[37:34] your refuge is in christ
[37:37] this message delivers you to the holy
[37:40] ghost
[37:41] hallelujah that's why it's three works
[37:43] of grace just forgive your sacrificial
[37:44] holy ghost
[37:46] hallelujah i was working with on on
[37:48] wednesday last wednesday at the home
[37:49] church there and i was showing them that
[37:51] there there are so many promises that
[37:53] are available to the holy ghost believer
[37:56] i was looking online
[37:58] and and they said there's 3 000 biblical
[38:01] promises in there
[38:04] see the devil wants you to have the
[38:06] entertainment and joys of of youtube or
[38:10] our television or a movie or something
[38:12] like that
[38:14] but to truly walk into christ you
[38:17] actually have so much of god available
[38:20] for you
[38:22] hallelujah 3 000
[38:25] i was thinking 300 when i looked it up
[38:30] 3 thousand that's why i was just writing
[38:32] i just told you a scripture where he
[38:33] inhabited his praise he promised he
[38:36] inhabits praise
[38:37] that's what he does that's his promise
[38:40] hallelujah now that he doesn't inhabit
[38:42] noise
[38:43] he doesn't inhabit uh something that
[38:45] sounds nice he inhabits praise amen he
[38:49] wants you to come to the house of god
[38:51] with a spirit of worship amen and he
[38:53] wants you to love on him amen he wants
[38:56] you to invite him
[38:58] come lord your bride is here and worship
[39:01] amen
[39:03] hallelujah
[39:06] so he says it shall come to pass that he
[39:08] that is left in zion he that it's a
[39:10] remnant in jerusalem shall let's see in
[39:12] jerusalem shall be called holy even
[39:14] every one that is written among the
[39:16] living in jerusalem see wherein the lord
[39:18] shall have washed away the filth of the
[39:21] daughter of zion notice what he says
[39:24] remember that's always the bride
[39:27] hallelujah
[39:28] so when we say zion
[39:30] spiritually in the old testament it's
[39:32] talking about the bride
[39:35] all right now we're going somewhere at
[39:36] this now hold on i know everybody's like
[39:37] i know that glory to god
[39:40] we're coming
[39:41] he said remember that's always the bride
[39:43] and shall have purified the blood of
[39:44] jerusalem that's the remnant of the jews
[39:46] plus bride in the midst thereof with the
[39:49] spirit of judgment and fire all right
[39:51] now
[39:52] let's go this little path now okay
[39:54] i want to show you something now
[39:56] all right we're going to remove these
[39:57] scriptures very quickly here so i want
[39:59] you to see this so
[40:01] we know according to scripture when the
[40:04] bible talks about zion and mount zion in
[40:07] the old testament he's talking about the
[40:08] bride all right
[40:11] that's factual
[40:13] but what is mount zion
[40:16] mount zion is actually a location
[40:20] within israel
[40:22] also synonymously called at times
[40:25] jerusalem
[40:27] there's a new heavens and a new earth
[40:30] coming forth amen there's also what a
[40:32] new city new jerusalem that will come
[40:36] down 1500 by 1500 miles by 1500 miles it
[40:40] will come down and set right at the spot
[40:43] of jerusalem
[40:45] hallelujah
[40:47] now watch this because in the old
[40:49] testament
[40:50] this all ties in really good and i'm
[40:51] going to take you somewhere i just trust
[40:52] you'll be blessed
[40:54] joshua 24 11 so remember
[40:57] god what he raises moses up and he says
[41:00] go take that land flowing with milk and
[41:02] honey
[41:04] moses takes them in the wilderness they
[41:06] spy out the land they have a bad rapport
[41:08] and what they can't go in so god has to
[41:10] raise up joshua
[41:12] joshua parallels ephesians of the new
[41:14] testament
[41:16] it is what ephesians is a grace move in
[41:19] the new testament
[41:20] it's not based on your law it's based on
[41:23] who you are amen god reveals to your
[41:26] predestination
[41:29] he reveals to you that watch that you're
[41:31] saved by grace not by message works
[41:34] you're saved by faith through grace in
[41:37] jesus christ amen
[41:40] hallelujah
[41:42] when you look what the prophet said he
[41:43] said and he talks about the people that
[41:44] missed the rapture he says they thought
[41:46] they were under the blood
[41:49] the foolish virgin thought they were
[41:51] under the blood of matthew 25.
[41:54] they thought they were there
[41:56] but they weren't
[41:59] hallelujah
[42:03] let's move into this now
[42:05] so someone could think that they're
[42:07] under the blood
[42:09] because they go to a message church
[42:11] because they heard the midnight cry
[42:18] but there's only one that can baptize
[42:20] you with the spirit
[42:21] it's not a church it's not a pastor it's
[42:23] not a messenger it is jesus christ
[42:26] himself
[42:27] coming on an individual level to you
[42:30] blessed are your eyes for they see
[42:32] blessed are your ears for they hear
[42:35] god is trying to call you to a place
[42:39] that you can be so in tune with him that
[42:42] you will be the saith the lord or sit
[42:45] still
[42:48] got quiet on that one
[42:50] glory
[42:51] as long as you can say amen
[42:55] hallelujah because that's what you're
[42:56] called for
[42:59] all right let's go
[43:01] so what so now
[43:03] joshua goes into the land god says as i
[43:05] was with moses so i'll be thee you're
[43:07] praying i know your pastor's been
[43:08] preaching on this
[43:10] they were invincibly conquering that
[43:12] land
[43:15] hallelujah
[43:16] joshua 24 11. and you went over jordan
[43:18] and came into jericho and the men of
[43:20] jericho fought against you the amorites
[43:22] parasites and canaanites and the
[43:23] hittites girgishites hivites and
[43:25] jebusites and i delivered them into your
[43:27] hand
[43:28] so god fought them for for them god
[43:31] fought him
[43:33] joshua 23 3 and you have seen remember
[43:35] there's seven in uh enemies i got oh i
[43:37] got ah yeah
[43:40] seven enemies in that land
[43:43] and god said i fought him for you i
[43:44] delivered you for you amen
[43:47] joshua 23 3
[43:50] and you have seen all that the lord your
[43:51] god have done unto all these nations
[43:53] because of you for the lord your god is
[43:55] he that fought for you
[43:59] do you see the difference between law
[44:01] and grace
[44:06] you see
[44:07] the law is dead right
[44:10] as far as advice it can't save you
[44:13] the bible says that if you've offended
[44:15] in one point you're guilty of the whole
[44:18] the only way to move in grace is to
[44:20] receive christ and have him move upon
[44:23] you
[44:25] now remember everything that you're
[44:27] going to be uh receiving as a christian
[44:29] you receive it by how
[44:31] about how pretty you look
[44:33] by how great you're going to live out
[44:34] holiness
[44:36] everything you receive is actually done
[44:39] because of your faith because you are
[44:41] abraham's face seat
[44:44] hallelujah
[44:46] when your prophet talked about it he
[44:48] said that what he says by your faith you
[44:51] accept that
[44:54] so we can say i have faith but faith
[44:57] accepts it
[44:59] how do you get the holy ghost
[45:01] oh i got to live cleaner no you're
[45:03] missing it
[45:06] you've got to die to self
[45:08] and stand there and say god you promised
[45:11] if i repented and got baptized in the
[45:13] name of jesus christ you'd give me the
[45:16] promise of the holy ghost
[45:18] notice the holy ghost is a promise
[45:21] it is not a marriage
[45:26] god unconditionally gave abraham the
[45:28] land
[45:32] and by faith he took it amen
[45:36] hallelujah i was working with on
[45:38] wednesday
[45:39] when when we talk about abraham in
[45:41] genesis 13 the scripture says that god
[45:44] told him to look north south east and
[45:45] west
[45:46] he said everything you see it's yours
[45:49] and then when he got done saying that he
[45:50] said arise and walk through that land
[45:55] so it wasn't just good enough that he'd
[45:56] seen it
[45:58] oh i see the promises of god oh i see
[46:00] the holy ghost oh i see somebody else
[46:02] the holy ghost in there
[46:03] all right brother
[46:06] by faith they had to see that god gave
[46:09] them all that amen he gave them all that
[46:12] land and then what you arise he said and
[46:14] go through that land and what take the
[46:17] length and the breath and look through
[46:19] the entire land
[46:22] this holy ghost got gifts for you he's
[46:24] got fruits for you hallelujah he's got
[46:27] power upon power for you and when god
[46:30] comes to you faith is the substance of
[46:33] things hoped for amen when god raises up
[46:35] something in you i need this i need that
[46:39] he will give it to you
[46:42] he didn't say whatsoever things you need
[46:46] if you can believe it i'll give it to
[46:47] you
[46:48] he said whatever things you desire
[46:52] you can have it
[46:54] but what your desire has to line up with
[46:56] the word
[46:58] you can't go in there carnally
[47:02] god has so much
[47:04] you see what i'm saying
[47:05] if you ain't got no joy you know what
[47:07] the issue is you ain't pulling you ain't
[47:08] you ain't walking through the land to
[47:09] see your joy
[47:10] your joy's walking through the land
[47:13] if you ain't walked into joy yet you
[47:15] gotta walk through it
[47:17] peace you gotta walk through it

[47:21] redemptive nature you walk through it

[47:26] he's your peace jehovah general walk
[47:29] through it
[47:30] these are things that god says are yours
[47:35] brother bram said he said i never
[47:37] understood christians he said
[47:39] he said he said they can't accept it
[47:43] he said god he's talking about abraham
[47:44] he said god gave him all that land he
[47:46] said he said what can't they do they
[47:48] can't accept it
[47:51] he said when i seen the bible he said i
[47:54] wanted to see everything in it
[47:57] he said he and then this is this this is
[47:59] the 60s he says he says it's just like
[48:01] an arcade
[48:02] he said if there's things on the shelf
[48:05] that i can't i can't see that's still
[48:08] mine
[48:09] he said so what i do i go get a ladder
[48:11] he said jacob's ladder and i fall on my
[48:14] knees and i start praying until i can
[48:17] climb up and see it
[48:20] hallelujah your faith grows with
[48:23] communion
[48:24] your faith grows as you commune so much
[48:27] with him his mind becomes your mind and
[48:30] what you can accept his faith through
[48:32] you
[48:34] hallelujah
[48:37] amen
[48:40] now
[48:42] so what'd he say
[48:43] it's god that fights for you
[48:45] he's the one that fought through you he
[48:47] said behold i've divided on you by a lot
[48:49] these nations reign to be inheritance
[48:51] for your tribes for jordan from jordan
[48:53] with all the nations cut off even unto
[48:54] the great sea westward
[48:56] and the lord your god he shall expel
[48:58] them from before you and drive them out
[49:00] of your sight and ye shall possess their
[49:02] land as the lord your god hath promised
[49:04] unto you
[49:05] god promised they were going to take
[49:07] that land
[49:08] right
[49:09] but joshua rebukes him and said you've
[49:11] been slack
[49:12] yes
[49:13] you've been slack you're not going to
[49:15] your inheritance
[49:16] now watch us watch us
[49:19] joshua 13 josh is old and stricken in
[49:21] years lord said unto him thou art old
[49:23] and stricken in years and they remaineth
[49:25] yet very much land to be possessed
[49:29] all right
[49:30] they were done fighting with joshua all
[49:32] these victories
[49:34] not anyone dying at all
[49:38] it was promised of god that they had
[49:40] inhabited the entire land of israel
[49:42] sir brother sister i believe that when
[49:45] abraham god told him to arise and walk
[49:47] through that land i believe the same
[49:49] land that israel ended up with
[49:51] is what abraham went and seen
[49:57] i don't believe that abraham took a
[49:58] one-day journey on a horse or a camel or
[50:01] whatever and he said yep looks like it's
[50:02] good and it's fine
[50:05] because god told him to go
[50:08] go look through all of it
[50:12] see the same god that gave him the
[50:13] revelation that he'd have a son
[50:16] gave him the revelation that wherever
[50:19] you go it's yours
[50:22] he's seen it and then israel possessed
[50:24] it amen
[50:28] why are you saying that no no i didn't
[50:30] say this because
[50:31] i might think everybody knows it but but
[50:33] the scripture says that why we know that
[50:35] the land was a type of the holy ghost
[50:39] so all that you can go out god promised
[50:41] you you can you have utmost limitless
[50:43] bounds
[50:45] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:47] you can see every single all three
[50:49] thousands are your sister naomi it's
[50:51] yours you don't need brother jesse's
[50:52] permission you know your parents
[50:55] it's not based on what someone can give
[50:57] you or what you can do
[50:59] it's based on how much you can die out
[51:02] to your husband christ
[51:05] i understand i'm staying
[51:07] all you're wanting him to do is be your
[51:08] husband because your husband is the
[51:10] owner of all of it
[51:13] he wants to give it to you
[51:15] that's why your prophet said the gifts
[51:17] have to be in the church
[51:20] the type is rebecca
[51:24] eliezer brought gifts to rebecca yes sir
[51:30] she took those gifts those gifts and put
[51:33] them on
[51:34] and wore them all the way back because
[51:36] they weren't eliezers gifts
[51:39] they were god sent from isaac to
[51:42] rebecca
[51:45] hallelujah
[51:47] they're your
[51:48] gifts before the bride of jesus christ
[51:52] amen
[51:54] you say brother cam you're excited yes
[51:56] i'm excited the anointing is here how
[51:59] can i not rejoice
[52:01] you see you're experiencing heaven right
[52:04] now
[52:07] ephesians is heavenly places
[52:11] we should be what that's your promise
[52:14] i don't believe brother sister that
[52:16] heavenly places is well we come to
[52:18] church
[52:20] are we coming we listen to the word
[52:21] we're all passing out
[52:23] it's your promise you know the brother
[52:25] brother branham said he said that when
[52:27] you fall asleep in church he says the
[52:28] devil it's making you do that
[52:31] so what do mature christians do
[52:34] hallelujah i wasn't preaching the day at
[52:35] home church i did what brother jesse i
[52:37] stood right up
[52:38] because because i felt i literally felt
[52:40] the atmosphere dive twice
[52:43] and after that first time i jumped up i
[52:46] go
[52:49] hallelujah
[52:51] because i felt the atmosphere
[52:53] and i felt it trying to cling on to me
[52:56] it wasn't my you know what after i got
[52:58] up i wasn't tired
[53:02] you don't have to get up either that's
[53:04] just what i did if god tells you and
[53:05] you're in your sin you're getting tired
[53:07] you say no devil i'm in heaven right now
[53:10] i'm where the word is coming forth my
[53:13] god is in this room amen
[53:17] i'm not making something up the bible
[53:19] says where two or more gathered in his
[53:21] name there am i in the midst
[53:25] another promise is yours
[53:31] hallelujah
[53:33] all it is is revelation
[53:37] laodicea tries to make us so flesh-bound
[53:39] you are zion hallelujah
[53:44] we got a reason to be excited we gotta
[53:46] reach in the shout amen because god is
[53:49] promised he is with us amen
[53:54] you know your promise in acts 10
[53:57] said well peter yet speak these words
[53:59] the holy ghost fell on him
[54:05] you know what that means
[54:07] brother cam
[54:08] you know peter's sermon was only 15
[54:09] minutes longer graham said
[54:12] you want to refilling you know it takes
[54:14] 15 minutes of preaching
[54:16] you want a healing you know it takes 15
[54:18] minutes
[54:22] but you see you're moving into an
[54:24] atmosphere you realize why you're there
[54:29] your promise that you should go from
[54:31] birth to birth to birth to birth
[54:35] he said every day of earth
[54:38] that's not fiction brother sister that's
[54:41] your promise
[54:44] acts 4 your prophet said was three days
[54:46] after the upper
[54:50] room oh
[54:53] and then he said
[54:54] he said there's too many people trying
[54:55] to trust an experience from 10 years ago
[54:59] oh hallelujah
[55:01] well i gave my heart to god way back
[55:03] here
[55:04] and there ain't nothing shown from it
[55:06] the problem is somebody didn't teach you
[55:09] someone didn't teach me
[55:11] we have to get in the word
[55:13] and see what our promises are
[55:18] i'm going somewhere this birth sister
[55:20] but i want you to see this they did not
[55:22] possess the land
[55:24] they didn't possess the holy ghost
[55:26] with joshua
[55:28] it just
[55:29] let's let's prove it i want you to see
[55:31] this joshua 15 63 as for the jebusites
[55:34] the inhabitants of jerusalem
[55:37] watch this
[55:38] the children of judah
[55:41] could not drive them out
[55:45] judah you know the lion of the tribe of
[55:47] judah
[55:50] god always sent them up first to battle
[55:52] yes
[55:54] they could not drive out the inhabitants
[55:56] of jerusalem
[56:00] but the gemsites dwell with the children
[56:02] of judah at jerusalem until this day
[56:04] they couldn't dry them out
[56:06] at the end of joshua they still couldn't
[56:07] drive them out
[56:10] all right judges 121
[56:14] and the children of benjamin did not
[56:15] drive out the jebusites that inhabited
[56:18] jerusalem
[56:19] judah couldn't do it
[56:20] benchmarks couldn't either
[56:24] who are these tributes
[56:28] dwell and what but the jebusites dwell
[56:31] with the children of benjamin and
[56:32] jerusalem until this day yes sir
[56:35] all through time we find out
[56:37] that there's this group that is stuck in
[56:39] jerusalem
[56:41] called the jebusites now i'm not going
[56:43] to read it for time's sake they did
[56:44] drive out some of the jebusites
[56:46] but they could not take
[56:49] jerusalem
[56:51] wait a minute
[56:53] why not
[56:57] now watch
[56:58] so it comes all the way
[57:03] to this right here in 2nd samuel 5 3.
[57:05] you mean it lasted all the way until 2nd
[57:07] samuel 5'3
[57:09] now watch this
[57:15] david
[57:16] david
[57:20] it's going to come down to david yes
[57:22] who's david
[57:26] david was a type of jesus christ
[57:29] [Music]
[57:32] notice with joshua there was no
[57:34] possession
[57:36] of jerusalem
[57:39] see types only run so far
[57:41] but when we look at the biblical story
[57:44] it comes saul didn't do it saul didn't
[57:46] even get the ark back in its spot
[57:49] but neither did david
[57:51] actually he brought it in but he didn't
[57:52] build the temple all right
[57:54] so notice
[57:56] watch us this is where you come in
[57:58] so all the elders of israel came to the
[58:01] king in hebron
[58:02] right so saul's dead now
[58:05] i want you to see what happens saul dies
[58:08] david was already ruling for seven years
[58:11] but now everybody now saul's dead his
[58:13] son's dead yes
[58:15] and now everybody comes
[58:18] to the king in hebrew
[58:20] and king david made a league with them
[58:23] in hebron before the lord
[58:25] so now notice what does he do
[58:27] he makes a league with them
[58:32] he brings a fresh uniting with david
[58:36] yeah
[58:37] that's rush
[58:40] and they anointed david king over israel
[58:43] david was 30 years old when he began to
[58:45] reign he reigned 40 years and in hebron
[58:48] he reigned over judah seven years and
[58:50] six months and in jerusalem he reigned
[58:51] thirty and three years over all israel
[58:53] and judah that's something 33 years just
[58:56] like christ
[58:58] hallelujah
[59:00] now watch
[59:01] so david now he unites all of his people
[59:06] of israel together
[59:08] remember
[59:09] now notice this
[59:13] your prophet said that it would take a
[59:15] press to get the church together
[59:18] numerous places
[59:20] i don't believe i i don't know i'm just
[59:22] presuming but i don't believe because
[59:24] your prophet said there'll be one in
[59:25] jefferson there'll be some over here be
[59:26] someone here they'll be about you know
[59:28] 20 or however many they'll be over in
[59:29] akron
[59:32] hallelujah
[59:33] i preached like this in my church i said
[59:35] i'm not believing three three three
[59:36] types of beliefs i'm believing an
[59:38] exception right here
[59:40] i believe god's gonna have thirty or
[59:42] forty how are many over and over in the
[59:43] point
[59:44] i believe that i'm not giving up on
[59:46] anybody
[59:48] i'm going to pray with compassion and
[59:50] love i don't care how bastard they look
[59:52] or religious or or or what they're
[59:55] showing i believe that something has
[59:57] drawn them to the word and no matter
[1:00:00] what devil it is my god is going to cast
[1:00:02] it out amen
[1:00:04] hallelujah how's he going to do it
[1:00:07] it doesn't matter but i'm putting love
[1:00:08] on it because love will drive the devil
[1:00:11] away
[1:00:12] that's why faith worketh by love
[1:00:17] so as the bride is coming to the
[1:00:19] capstone
[1:00:20] the agape love
[1:00:22] what happens
[1:00:24] there's a third pole for you brother
[1:00:25] sister
[1:00:26] you know within those five
[1:00:27] identifications
[1:00:28] there's the ability to speak salvation
[1:00:34] well if there's salvation that means you
[1:00:35] can speak a rapture too
[1:00:39] well that's for brother branham brother
[1:00:41] cam
[1:00:43] you can believe whatever you want to
[1:00:44] believe
[1:00:45] but when i look at it brother branham
[1:00:46] types the holy or the holy spirit with
[1:00:48] the third pole
[1:00:50] he says he when he talks about their in
[1:00:52] certain thoughts he says he
[1:00:56] third pole is another work
[1:00:59] remember
[1:01:00] even souls that are in prison now what'd
[1:01:02] he say he said all ministries have three
[1:01:05] polls
[1:01:08] you got a ministry
[1:01:10] wait a minute i thought brother graham
[1:01:11] said everybody has a ministry
[1:01:15] it's just how he lives it through them
[1:01:18] in position
[1:01:20] sisters are not called to the pulpit the
[1:01:22] bible says that right but you've got a
[1:01:24] ministry
[1:01:26] hallelujah
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] all brothers don't but what whatever
[1:01:32] their position is we've got to get that
[1:01:34] positional placement
[1:01:37] when we get in place then it lives
[1:01:44] and the king sixth verse and his man
[1:01:46] went to jerusalem
[1:01:48] unto the jebusites
[1:01:50] the inhabitants of the land
[1:01:53] come down to david
[1:01:54] which spake unto david saying
[1:01:57] except thou take away the blind and the
[1:02:01] lame
[1:02:02] thou shalt not come in hither thinking
[1:02:07] david
[1:02:08] cannot come hither i want to stop here
[1:02:12] so notice
[1:02:13] the inhabitants of the jebusites
[1:02:16] they went through hundreds of years
[1:02:20] where joshua they would go to jericho
[1:02:22] and walls come coming down
[1:02:26] they see the 30 had some kings they were
[1:02:29] killed and destroyed all the people
[1:02:30] drove out and hallelujah i was watching
[1:02:33] a video and they said that some of the
[1:02:35] giants that that joshua drove out
[1:02:37] actually ended up on some of these isles
[1:02:39] over by italy
[1:02:41] and by oral tradition they came from
[1:02:43] israel when joshua drove them out
[1:02:49] but look at this
[1:02:50] they could drive out giants
[1:02:54] but there was a specific time
[1:02:57] in a specific king that had to be there
[1:03:00] in order for them to take jerusalem
[1:03:04] but notice how haughty they become this
[1:03:06] is jfb commentary it says it was
[1:03:08] strongly fortified and deemed so
[1:03:11] impregnable that the blind and the lame
[1:03:13] were sent to man the battlements in
[1:03:16] derisive mockery of the hebrew king's
[1:03:18] attack
[1:03:21] and two shout david cannot come in
[1:03:24] hither
[1:03:25] to understand the full meaning and force
[1:03:28] of this insulting taunt it is necessary
[1:03:31] to bear in mind the depth and steepness
[1:03:34] of the valley of gehan
[1:03:36] and the lofty walls of the ancient
[1:03:38] canaanite fortress
[1:03:45] wait a minute
[1:03:47] so god
[1:03:49] allowed the jebusites to take jerusalem
[1:03:54] and it was so strongly fortified
[1:03:57] it was actually according to what you
[1:03:59] read it was one of the greatest
[1:04:00] accomplishments that david had
[1:04:06] and no israelite before could even touch
[1:04:10] it that's right right
[1:04:15] hallelujah
[1:04:16] now watch
[1:04:18] so what
[1:04:21] well think about it in a spiritual sense
[1:04:22] brother sister
[1:04:24] there's one thing
[1:04:26] that we're fighting for
[1:04:29] we're fighting to return to the original
[1:04:33] and there's one squatter
[1:04:36] that has been holding this rapture up
[1:04:38] the whole time
[1:04:43] but the rapture
[1:04:45] is not dependent on him
[1:04:49] the rapture is all
[1:04:51] dependent on david when it's time for
[1:04:55] david to take over
[1:04:57] [Music]
[1:05:00] and notice it's a unification time that
[1:05:03] when david remember the lineage had to
[1:05:06] come through david
[1:05:08] he was the first rightful king of israel
[1:05:13] he had the what he didn't have the
[1:05:15] height he had the heart
[1:05:21] and what even in david's time the
[1:05:23] scripture said
[1:05:25] and watched all the men that were
[1:05:27] discouraged that were tired of saul the
[1:05:29] nicolas in spirit they went to david
[1:05:35] they were tired of denomination they
[1:05:37] were tired of dead services they were
[1:05:40] tired of false anointings they wanted
[1:05:43] the real anointing amen
[1:05:45] and when they were looking for david
[1:05:47] they seen he was truly anointed to be
[1:05:50] the king of kings amen
[1:05:54] watch this
[1:05:58] so they what they think david
[1:06:01] is no different
[1:06:03] they said we've destroyed everyone else
[1:06:05] they couldn't take this area
[1:06:08] you know the devil's been sitting here
[1:06:09] for all these years
[1:06:11] right so many people thought it would
[1:06:13] happen they thought the rapture was
[1:06:15] going to happen in the 60s
[1:06:17] they thought it was going to be when
[1:06:18] brother branham was here it wasn't you
[1:06:20] know why because god won't share his
[1:06:22] glory with no one else
[1:06:26] hallelujah
[1:06:27] it don't matter what man it is on the
[1:06:29] scene right now it ain't mine it ain't
[1:06:31] no no these big churches nothing there's
[1:06:34] only one that you can glory in and that
[1:06:37] is the lovely lord jesus christ
[1:06:41] what's he waiting for he's waiting for
[1:06:44] his church to unite with him
[1:06:47] you gotta see he's king
[1:06:50] you gotta see he's anointed
[1:06:53] don't you see that when they joined with
[1:06:56] david they all seemed
[1:06:58] well they could never get away from it
[1:07:01] oh hallelujah i won't do it for time's
[1:07:03] sake but when you when you see this
[1:07:05] finished
[1:07:06] god goes on to to mark david
[1:07:09] and all of his mighty men
[1:07:13] to show that these people it didn't
[1:07:16] matter if there's 900 people there it
[1:07:18] was just one guy he'd go kill them all
[1:07:21] he didn't need david because he was
[1:07:23] joined in spirit
[1:07:24] now i'm typing that
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:27] he knew he was with david
[1:07:30] so he could go and take on anybody
[1:07:36] because it was god's desire to have
[1:07:38] david to be king
[1:07:40] and it was his mission to help get him
[1:07:42] there
[1:07:43] right back to those seven horns
[1:07:47] hallelujah look at the seals
[1:07:51] watch
[1:07:53] so notice they didn't say israel can't
[1:07:55] come have feather
[1:07:57] they called it david the type of christ
[1:08:00] jesus they called him the son of david
[1:08:03] now remember i i won't have time to do
[1:08:05] this
[1:08:07] why david
[1:08:08] what was david's purpose
[1:08:11] remember
[1:08:12] david was such a type of jesus christ
[1:08:15] that it said that he put all enemies
[1:08:16] under his feet
[1:08:20] the scripture said that he shed blood
[1:08:22] abundantly
[1:08:24] yes yes so he couldn't make the temple
[1:08:27] remember solomon's temple was a type of
[1:08:30] of the holy ghost uh outpouring uh uh in
[1:08:33] the upper room
[1:08:34] your prophet said that he said psalm is
[1:08:36] a type old testament type of ephesians
[1:08:38] church age
[1:08:40] so he says
[1:08:41] you know what i'm talking about
[1:08:42] i preach all about it it's there
[1:08:46] but what was david's job
[1:08:48] to shed blood
[1:08:51] what was jesus christ's job to shed
[1:08:54] blood
[1:08:57] what do we read about the new testament
[1:08:59] what was what was jesus's job to put all
[1:09:02] enemies under his feet
[1:09:06] what does scripture say that david put
[1:09:08] all his enemies under his feet
[1:09:13] david was a perfect bible type you won't
[1:09:16] find it in the niv you won't find it in
[1:09:18] the amplified you will find all these
[1:09:20] all these other different bibles with
[1:09:21] different different uh codexes and
[1:09:24] documents manuscripts you won't find it
[1:09:25] you'll find it right in the king james
[1:09:28] because the revelation is to the bride
[1:09:30] of jesus christ
[1:09:35] nevertheless seven verse
[1:09:38] david took the stronghold of zion
[1:09:41] now watch what he says
[1:09:43] the same is the city of david
[1:09:47] and david said on that day
[1:09:50] whosoever geteth up to
[1:09:53] the gutter
[1:09:57] and smiteth the jebusites and the lame
[1:10:00] and the blind
[1:10:05] that are hated of david's soul he shall
[1:10:08] be chief and captain wherefore they said
[1:10:10] the blind and the lame shall not come
[1:10:12] into the house
[1:10:14] so david dwell in the fort and called
[1:10:16] the city of david and david built round
[1:10:19] about from mello and inward and david
[1:10:22] went on and grew great and the lord god
[1:10:25] of hosts was with him
[1:10:27] yes
[1:10:29] the last land
[1:10:31] that david took
[1:10:34] was zion
[1:10:43] watch this
[1:10:45] but notice
[1:10:47] was it david that went up himself
[1:10:51] no
[1:10:54] but what did david have
[1:10:57] david actually what he had the
[1:11:00] revelation
[1:11:01] of how to take the city
[1:11:12] wait a minute
[1:11:13] how is he going to take the city
[1:11:15] whosoever geth up to the gutter remember
[1:11:17] it's on a mountain
[1:11:19] whosoever giveth up to the gutter and
[1:11:22] smite of them
[1:11:25] they will be chief and captain of that
[1:11:27] city
[1:11:29] so wait a minute god is now saying
[1:11:35] right through david
[1:11:37] he's going to tell you how to do it
[1:11:40] but you've got to go do it
[1:11:45] by how
[1:11:47] the revelation of david
[1:11:51] david had the revelation of how to take
[1:11:54] the city
[1:11:58] you might not be understand where i'm
[1:11:59] going you'll get in just a sec
[1:12:00] now watch watch this
[1:12:04] according to commentators
[1:12:06] this word gutter here it's only used in
[1:12:08] one other spot and it's actually talking
[1:12:10] about water spouts
[1:12:14] but the commentators say that that word
[1:12:16] gutter it's actually talking about a
[1:12:18] specific subterranean passage that was
[1:12:21] into
[1:12:22] mount zion
[1:12:25] there was a secret way into it
[1:12:31] and david knew about it
[1:12:35] and he told them
[1:12:37] where it was and how to get in
[1:12:41] wait a minute
[1:12:43] didn't your prophet say that right at
[1:12:45] the end time there'd be a short quick
[1:12:48] message sent to the church
[1:12:50] and the church would take it and go into
[1:12:52] the rapture
[1:12:54] [Laughter]
[1:12:57] glory
[1:13:01] the secret is with david
[1:13:05] oh my i'm still sitting in heavenly
[1:13:06] places brother sister i don't know about
[1:13:08] you but i'm sitting right there because
[1:13:10] i want you to see this jesus christ has
[1:13:12] your revelation to get this rapture
[1:13:15] but i want you to say this because
[1:13:18] the rapture that anointing is already in
[1:13:21] this room
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] the ability to make the rapture is what
[1:13:26] he who abides in you
[1:13:30] we've got to get closer
[1:13:32] we've got to get hungry
[1:13:37] scripture says in luke 16 16 the law and
[1:13:39] the prophets were until john since that
[1:13:42] time the kingdom of god is preached and
[1:13:44] every man presseth into it
[1:13:49] how are you going to get into it
[1:13:52] you got to press into it
[1:13:54] you've got to take zion
[1:14:00] how are you going to take zion
[1:14:05] wait a minute the dynamics
[1:14:07] is nothing
[1:14:09] more than a refilling of the holy ghost
[1:14:11] which god had worked in a small measure
[1:14:15] while the capstone was coming down
[1:14:17] so you're actually supposed to learn how
[1:14:20] to get what
[1:14:22] refillings of the holy ghost
[1:14:25] and that will bring you
[1:14:27] to the dynamics because you're already
[1:14:30] sealed when he brings it
[1:14:36] you've got to press into this zion
[1:14:40] what's zion that's the bride of jesus
[1:14:41] christ
[1:14:44] now notice this i want you to see this
[1:14:49] let me go back
[1:14:50] it is easier so notice how he ties us in
[1:14:53] and it is easier for heaven and earth to
[1:14:55] pass than the one tittle of the law to
[1:14:58] fail
[1:15:01] why does he join that together
[1:15:03] what's he doing
[1:15:08] if you go to luke 17
[1:15:10] uh uh
[1:15:12] four and five
[1:15:13] and the the disciples go to jesus and
[1:15:15] they say increase our faith
[1:15:18] remember that
[1:15:19] and jesus christ how do you answer them
[1:15:21] he said if ye say unto the sycamine tree
[1:15:25] be plucked up
[1:15:27] and cast in the sea and obey you
[1:15:33] how does that increase faith how does
[1:15:35] this increase faith
[1:15:39] don't you see it all you need is the
[1:15:41] word
[1:15:45] remember brother branham said if evil to
[1:15:47] just use the word she wouldn't have fell
[1:15:50] that's why when jesus fasted for 40 days
[1:15:54] all he needed was the word to combat the
[1:15:56] devil
[1:15:58] he wanted to show you that all you
[1:16:00] needed was this baptism of the holy
[1:16:02] ghost with the word of god amen you
[1:16:04] would slay every single devil in your
[1:16:06] way amen
[1:16:11] hallelujah how am i gonna press it by
[1:16:13] the word amen
[1:16:15] because i'm hungry for it i want it amen
[1:16:17] and jesus is the word my husband amen
[1:16:24] now watchers i want to show you this
[1:16:25] real quick
[1:16:26] i went through this before i just
[1:16:28] touched it
[1:16:30] second chronicles 3 2 1 2.
[1:16:33] so david takes
[1:16:35] he takes mount zion okay
[1:16:38] did you know
[1:16:39] that it was oh
[1:16:41] samuel 19
[1:16:45] when david actually takes mount moriah
[1:16:48] well what's the difference between mount
[1:16:49] zion mount moriah
[1:16:51] now solomon began to build the house of
[1:16:52] the lord at jerusalem on mount moriah
[1:16:56] where the lord had appeared to his
[1:16:58] father david at the place that david had
[1:17:01] prepared on the threshing floor of ornan
[1:17:03] the jebusite and he began to build on
[1:17:05] the second day of the second month in
[1:17:07] the fourth year of his reign
[1:17:09] look at this picture
[1:17:11] mount zion
[1:17:13] is here
[1:17:14] and mount moriah is here
[1:17:19] mount moriah is where the temple is
[1:17:22] built
[1:17:25] mount zion is what
[1:17:29] it's the castles
[1:17:32] wait a minute i'm still not getting it
[1:17:34] brother
[1:17:37] god always calls jerusalem mount zion
[1:17:41] yes why does he put emphasis on zion and
[1:17:45] not moriah
[1:17:52] moriah is the temple ministration
[1:17:56] but it's fulfillment is in mount zion
[1:18:01] why
[1:18:03] my moriah is what brings your what it
[1:18:06] brings your sacrifice it blings your
[1:18:08] blood
[1:18:09] but mount zion is actually the dwelling
[1:18:13] of husband and wife
[1:18:20] hallelujah
[1:18:22] so that's why he's always talking about
[1:18:24] he didn't say i want to inhabit mount
[1:18:26] moriah
[1:18:27] but he actually joins all jerusalem or
[1:18:30] the city of peace in mount zion
[1:18:37] hallelujah i hope you can see it amen
[1:18:42] see
[1:18:44] my mariah is not his portion
[1:18:47] zion is his portion
[1:18:49] you are his portion
[1:18:51] you know why it's a tribulation to come
[1:18:54] because god is still calling those names
[1:18:56] on the book
[1:18:59] there is still an accuser of the
[1:19:01] brethren that's trying to stop you
[1:19:03] he's trying to say david you can't have
[1:19:05] it
[1:19:06] you can't have zion
[1:19:13] yes i'm laughing but i'm laughing at the
[1:19:15] devil amen
[1:19:17] he thinks he can have you
[1:19:20] he thinks he can keep you bound in sin
[1:19:24] and shame but brother sister there is a
[1:19:26] revelation with this gospel that what
[1:19:29] god cannot impute sin upon you
[1:19:36] you can fail 10 times a day
[1:19:39] god can impuge it amen
[1:19:41] because you're under that blood amen
[1:19:47] that's why i think brother sister let
[1:19:49] all of them say that brother branham was
[1:19:51] a false prophet let him make all sorts
[1:19:52] of stuff up let him come up with the
[1:19:54] facts of how inconsistent he was
[1:19:57] let him come up with it
[1:19:58] because they don't understand the
[1:20:00] purpose
[1:20:03] i understand the purpose
[1:20:05] do you understand the purpose yes sir
[1:20:07] yes
[1:20:10] when i looked at brother branham
[1:20:14] and i seen that i said oh god what's
[1:20:15] going on here
[1:20:17] and god brought it to him and he said
[1:20:19] he said that's how far grace goes
[1:20:22] he could tell a story wrong in a sermon
[1:20:25] and then the angel of the lord without
[1:20:27] an apology
[1:20:28] without saying i think that's how it
[1:20:30] went well hopefully i tell this right he
[1:20:32] tell the story he tell it wrong
[1:20:39] hallelujah
[1:20:41] don't you get it
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:45] the holy ghost falling tonight is not
[1:20:47] based on what you're doing right now
[1:20:50] it's based on what you're believing and
[1:20:52] what you see yourself as
[1:20:54] justified means you never did it in the
[1:20:56] first place
[1:20:58] hallelujah
[1:21:02] he could tell a story wrong say
[1:21:04] something wrong and then the angel lord
[1:21:05] come right down and vindicate the gift
[1:21:08] you don't think you got a gift you don't
[1:21:10] think you need to be vindicated he has
[1:21:13] already promised it you are stepping
[1:21:16] into the revelation amen
[1:21:20] all things are possible
[1:21:26] see it
[1:21:27] it's all about you
[1:21:29] don't you get it
[1:21:30] that's why the jews they want to stick
[1:21:32] right at all these laws and so forth
[1:21:34] they're missing and they're putting on
[1:21:35] mariah
[1:21:36] they're putting it on a weeping wall
[1:21:39] but the proof
[1:21:40] is in zion
[1:21:42] watch this
[1:21:43] i know i'm probably a little bit long
[1:21:44] but i feel so good right now it's hard
[1:21:46] to stop
[1:21:49] if we can see this
[1:21:51] apply it to your life
[1:21:54] you know what do you need to say
[1:21:56] zion's mine
[1:21:57] i'm the bride of jesus christ i've taken
[1:21:59] the city amen
[1:22:01] notice you've got to get back to
[1:22:03] ephesians
[1:22:04] what was ephesians brother cam
[1:22:06] but ye are come now come unto a mount
[1:22:09] zion
[1:22:10] and he talks about the city of angels
[1:22:12] they had such a move of the holy ghost
[1:22:14] that the literal presence of heaven was
[1:22:16] down in this dimension
[1:22:20] now brother branham said he said you
[1:22:22] think that heaven some far-off place
[1:22:24] he said but they're going to find out
[1:22:26] that it's actually right here it's only
[1:22:28] moving a little faster
[1:22:32] do you get what that means
[1:22:36] you could literally touch the throne
[1:22:40] you could literally touch the seat of
[1:22:42] the elders
[1:22:46] what's the holdup we don't know who we
[1:22:49] are
[1:22:51] the bible shows us who we are brother
[1:22:53] came why mount zion
[1:22:57] pick up your pen and write
[1:22:59] yes specifically to the bride
[1:23:01] watch this carefully now to see it in
[1:23:02] the word
[1:23:03] john was the forerunner of malachi 3. he
[1:23:06] planted the former rain and was rejected
[1:23:07] by the organizations of that day
[1:23:09] organizations
[1:23:12] jesus came and had a mount
[1:23:14] transfiguration showdown
[1:23:16] the second forerunner of christ will sow
[1:23:18] for the latter rain who was the second
[1:23:20] forerunner brother brown
[1:23:23] jesus will be the showdown
[1:23:27] between denominations and creeds wait a
[1:23:30] minute why doesn't that say
[1:23:32] between the bride and her flesh
[1:23:37] why doesn't it say that it'll be the
[1:23:39] showdown between
[1:23:40] the message
[1:23:45] and the denominations right brother
[1:23:53] that's exactly what i'm saying brother
[1:23:55] brown said he said that is one of the
[1:23:56] secrets that was under the seals
[1:23:59] he said the secret was god didn't like
[1:24:02] those organizations
[1:24:05] be careful because it's right in the
[1:24:06] message brother sister god's been
[1:24:08] revealing this thing to me lately and
[1:24:09] i'm seeing it
[1:24:10] and it comes down
[1:24:12] i even found out that i was doing it
[1:24:16] for the cam how how are you doing it
[1:24:23] i go off on a whole other sermon right
[1:24:24] now i can't do it but i'll say this
[1:24:27] when brother branham tied in
[1:24:29] the organization his nominational
[1:24:30] spirits he said it was divine leadership
[1:24:33] plus human
[1:24:34] right right anytime you or me
[1:24:38] any of us take our own will and start
[1:24:41] making our own decisions
[1:24:43] we're showing that we're basing it on
[1:24:45] humanism and not divine leadership
[1:24:48] let me say it let me say this i'm going
[1:24:49] to say it's loud and proud
[1:24:51] and i don't say proud in a prideful way
[1:24:53] by saying i'm going to say this boldly
[1:24:55] before you forgive me for that word
[1:24:58] when we go and we say okay i need youth
[1:25:01] programs
[1:25:03] we got people in the message now we got
[1:25:05] vbs we got vacation bible schools
[1:25:09] we got
[1:25:10] we got we got all sorts of little
[1:25:12] programs i got to be careful because i
[1:25:13] don't want to throw brothers under the
[1:25:14] bus
[1:25:16] but it's very obvious right now well
[1:25:18] we're having a pizza party for the youth
[1:25:19] we're having this we're having this it's
[1:25:21] denominationalism
[1:25:24] so wait we have to
[1:25:29] go back to what denominations do in
[1:25:30] order to get people to be happy in our
[1:25:31] church we need a football night we need
[1:25:33] to we need a vibe
[1:25:35] i'm not saying that you can't do it but
[1:25:36] i'm saying this if you're not a
[1:25:38] nicolaitan as far as a pastor you need
[1:25:40] to go to god and see if god approves it
[1:25:43] because you know what i'm being honest
[1:25:45] in my failure i was making too many
[1:25:47] decisions
[1:25:48] because i was too busy
[1:25:50] i said god i don't know here we go
[1:25:52] and i've come to find out
[1:25:54] that cam smith was making too many
[1:25:56] decisions
[1:25:57] but now i know
[1:26:01] it was one of the secrets hid under the
[1:26:02] seals watches
[1:26:05] jesus is going to come
[1:26:06] and show who is denominational with
[1:26:08] creeds
[1:26:10] it doesn't matter doesn't matter if
[1:26:12] you're a message believer that don't
[1:26:13] matter
[1:26:15] are
[1:26:16] is the message church led by man or god
[1:26:20] that's the deciding point
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:24] brother sister you will sit dead in this
[1:26:26] church if you sit under nickelodeonism
[1:26:29] because you're expecting a preacher to
[1:26:31] be anointed you're anointed
[1:26:33] hallelujah
[1:26:35] you're expecting his prayer his
[1:26:37] anointing to go to god it's your prayer
[1:26:39] your anointing
[1:26:41] it's not your pastor's gift alone it's
[1:26:43] your gifts
[1:26:47] you've got to die to self and live amen
[1:26:51] brother cam that's rough you sure ain't
[1:26:53] kidding it is rough
[1:26:55] that's why i say god forgive me
[1:26:58] for he will come back to back up his
[1:27:00] word and take his bride and rapture the
[1:27:02] first showdown was mount carmel the
[1:27:04] second was mount transfiguration
[1:27:06] and the third would be mount zion
[1:27:09] there it is
[1:27:12] there it is brother cam why zion because
[1:27:15] the very showdown
[1:27:17] notice they couldn't take joab's word
[1:27:20] for it
[1:27:21] they couldn't take any of the mighty
[1:27:22] man's word for how to go
[1:27:25] it was purely jesus christ
[1:27:30] now remember jesus is we're going to
[1:27:32] meet him in the air
[1:27:33] so who's the showdown really between
[1:27:40] with david he said whosoever geth up to
[1:27:43] the gutter
[1:27:44] and taketh the city
[1:27:49] that's what pick up your pen and write
[1:27:50] is all about
[1:27:52] he said that the bride in christ will be
[1:27:55] so much alike that she will become in
[1:27:58] this very image
[1:28:03] right
[1:28:04] greater work shall ye do for i go unto
[1:28:06] the father
[1:28:08] the very
[1:28:09] word of christ will be so much in the
[1:28:11] bride that shall be an invincible army
[1:28:13] brother cam
[1:28:16] watch this
[1:28:17] i'm going to tie this in lord shows me
[1:28:19] right before service
[1:28:21] first chronicles 11 4 same same spot
[1:28:23] watch this real quick
[1:28:24] cam you've been long gorgon i'm still in
[1:28:25] heaven just give me a chance to maybe
[1:28:27] maybe i'll come out maybe i'll stay in i
[1:28:29] can't promise nothing
[1:28:31] but i can promise you this that jesus
[1:28:33] christ is still here amen
[1:28:37] hallelujah as long as somebody's holding
[1:28:39] in that atmosphere there is always the
[1:28:42] ability to stay in it amen
[1:28:45] i knew even if you felt like you left a
[1:28:47] little bit ago you can get right in
[1:28:49] today man you can still while the word
[1:28:51] is speaking you can get the holy oak
[1:28:53] street feeling right on you amen
[1:28:57] here it is you're parallel watch this
[1:28:59] real quick and david and all israel went
[1:29:01] to jerusalem which is jebus
[1:29:06] where the jebusites were
[1:29:07] the inhabitants of the land now we've
[1:29:09] got the same portion but watch this
[1:29:10] there's one little difference here watch
[1:29:12] us
[1:29:13] nevertheless david took the castle of
[1:29:15] zion
[1:29:17] he was interested in what
[1:29:20] the castle
[1:29:23] who lives in the castle
[1:29:25] the king and the queen
[1:29:27] [Applause]
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:30] hallelujah
[1:29:35] and lot
[1:29:36] in taking it he sent them in to fight
[1:29:38] and take it
[1:29:40] the zion showdown that the bride that
[1:29:43] you are will live out
[1:29:46] so then david dwelt in the castle
[1:29:48] therefore they called it the city of
[1:29:49] david
[1:29:53] he's giving you
[1:29:55] the revelation of this holy ghost he's
[1:29:57] giving you how to take
[1:29:59] what system or whatever you've been
[1:30:01] brought up under and to come to the
[1:30:03] place the holy ghost has to be in me
[1:30:05] i've got to get hungry for this i've got
[1:30:07] to cry out i need as much holy ghost as
[1:30:09] my pastor
[1:30:11] you know when brother brahm said that
[1:30:12] the church can live no higher than a
[1:30:13] pastor
[1:30:14] that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try
[1:30:18] don't even think about living higher
[1:30:20] just say god let me live on that level
[1:30:23] if we all get on the same level it'll
[1:30:25] happen
[1:30:28] i told my church i said if i study and
[1:30:31] pray six to ten hours for most sermons
[1:30:35] how much should the church do
[1:30:37] this is what's killing us brother sister
[1:30:39] if you've come for service you need to
[1:30:41] prepare for service just like your
[1:30:42] pastor does just like the minister does
[1:30:46] the frolic's got to go
[1:30:48] because how are you going to operate in
[1:30:50] a gift
[1:30:51] how are you going to operate bring the
[1:30:52] holy ghost down if you're not doing
[1:30:54] anything to bring god here
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:30:58] that's hard that's hard
[1:30:59] but it's so true i'm telling you
[1:31:02] i'm seeing this like i've never seen it
[1:31:04] before but it'll work if you get there
[1:31:07] you
[1:31:09] oh it's all over me i can't help this
[1:31:14] why did brother branham say that when
[1:31:16] the gifts of the spirit were truly in
[1:31:17] the church that they would meet one hour
[1:31:19] before the service
[1:31:21] and the gifts would would all operate
[1:31:23] and then they'd go into service
[1:31:26] see we've come under this thought that
[1:31:28] it has to be during the preaching of the
[1:31:30] word
[1:31:31] it'll have to be in the worship
[1:31:34] the church the laity is supposed to be
[1:31:36] so in love and gifted with christ
[1:31:39] that they can be just like elijah they
[1:31:41] can say just bring me a minstrel that's
[1:31:42] all i need
[1:31:45] you don't need a pastor to show up
[1:31:48] and he's got a gift he'll be here
[1:31:51] or if he wants to whatever he wants to
[1:31:52] do if he wants to be a shepherd that's
[1:31:53] what he's gonna do but there should be
[1:31:54] enough people in this room and there are
[1:31:56] enough people in this room that if you
[1:31:58] can get set aside to jesus
[1:32:01] lay down all laodicea got to live this
[1:32:03] right through him
[1:32:07] but what's he after
[1:32:10] this last showdown brother sister
[1:32:12] is all about you going to your husband
[1:32:15] his wife have made herself ready
[1:32:19] now watch us watch us one last thing
[1:32:22] maybe
[1:32:24] jebus in hebrew means a trodden place as
[1:32:28] a threshing floor
[1:32:30] what was the threshing floor
[1:32:33] it was where they separated the wheat in
[1:32:35] the chat
[1:32:40] hallelujah
[1:32:42] which is what the feast of pentecost
[1:32:46] the waving of the loaves
[1:32:50] and what did jesus all type that the
[1:32:52] gathering to the garner it's the feast
[1:32:54] of pentecost that ends
[1:32:56] with
[1:32:57] the reaping of the wheat
[1:33:04] namely the dry rock
[1:33:07] see it might seem like it's dry to some
[1:33:08] people but god is still separating real
[1:33:11] seed wheat
[1:33:12] hallelujah brother cam
[1:33:17] notice as we close we can stand we can
[1:33:18] stand let's stand let's stand amen i
[1:33:22] still feel the holy ghost
[1:33:24] amen
[1:33:27] revelations 10 8
[1:33:29] this is after receiving the the final
[1:33:31] the final voice
[1:33:34] the full mysteries and the voice which i
[1:33:37] heard from heaven spake on me and again
[1:33:38] and said go and take the little book
[1:33:40] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:33:41] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:33:42] earth who is that christ
[1:33:46] he said you go take it
[1:33:48] yes yes
[1:33:50] you go take it
[1:33:53] now how does he ask you to take it
[1:33:55] you go take the
[1:33:57] you tell your book is open
[1:33:59] and jesus says hey
[1:34:01] watch what he says and i went on the
[1:34:03] angel and said to him give me a little
[1:34:05] book
[1:34:06] and he said take it eat it up and it
[1:34:07] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:34:09] be in my mouth sweet as honey and i took
[1:34:11] the little book out of the angel's hand
[1:34:13] and ate it up and it was my mouth sweet
[1:34:15] as honey and as soon as i had eaten it
[1:34:17] my belly was bitter and he said to me
[1:34:18] he'd almost prophesy again before many
[1:34:20] people's nations multiple thoughts
[1:34:21] tongues and nations and kings
[1:34:25] what is it
[1:34:26] it's coming right back down to what this
[1:34:27] is

[1:34:30] revelation that you needed
[1:34:34] to go and do the final work of the bride

[1:34:53] ephesians you have to be a mature church
[1:34:56] you have to be in the mature world
[1:34:58] living it
[1:35:00] watching him in your life that way
[1:35:03] if he's not there
[1:35:04] it's time
[1:35:06] what do you say
