[0:00] I'm going to just try to quickly go
[0:02] through these three here tonight and
[0:03] then begin hopefully chapter 12 by God's
[0:15] grace. Let's read uh 26 11:26 please and
[0:18] then we'll just uh get right into the
[0:20] word of God. How you doing sir? Feel
[0:23] good by God's grace. Feel
[0:26] better. Thank God sir. Hallelujah.
[0:30] 11:26 there. 11:26. Praise
[0:36] God. So, as we looked at a few weeks
[0:38] ago, there's numerous things. There's
[0:40] examination in here. There's blessing
[0:43] and fellowship and so many things that
[0:45] are part of communion. I want to read 26
[0:47] because the first one we'll look at is
[0:49] the Passover lamb in Exodus 12. But
[0:52] let's read 1 Corinthians 11:26. There we
[0:55] can read that one together. Ready? One,
[0:57] two, three. For as often as ye eat this
[1:01] bread and drink this cup, ye do shu the
[1:04] Lord's death till he come. Let's have
[1:07] one more word of prayer if we can.
[1:08] Father God, thank you, God, that we're
[1:09] marching to Zion. And it's all because
[1:11] of the cross, Lord God. Through the
[1:13] cross, we've seen the light. Hallelujah.
[1:15] It's opened our eyes to the truth of the
[1:17] word. So grateful for that, Lord. And as
[1:20] that song said, Lord, nothing could
[1:22] repay the debt of love we owe. That's
[1:24] why it's going to take an eternity, Lord
[1:25] God, for us to express our love to you,
[1:27] Lord God. My mind can't comprehend
[1:29] eternity. But Lord, I can see how it's
[1:31] going to take eternity to express all of
[1:34] our love for such a great God as you
[1:36] are, Lord God. So, we love you, God. We
[1:38] worship you today. Stir our faith up
[1:40] here tonight, Lord. Strengthen us by
[1:41] your grace as we work through this book,
[1:44] Lord. We want to preach what Paul
[1:45] preached, Lord God. We know that's what
[1:47] the voices said beyond the curtain of
[1:49] time. Lord, when uh Brother Brandham
[1:52] went be behind the curtain, Lord God, uh
[1:55] Lord, we're they're resting on the fact
[1:56] that brother Brandham preached exactly
[1:58] what Paul preaches. So, we're thankful
[1:59] for a prophet who restored the word,
[2:01] point us back to the word of God today,
[2:03] we'd say. So, Lord, we seek to know that
[2:05] more, Lord. Apply it to our lives by
[2:07] your grace and mercy in Jesus Christ's
[2:09] name. The saints said, "Amen." God bless
[2:12] you as you're being seated there. Praise
[2:15] God. All right. So uh f let's uh start
[2:19] here. Let's go to Exodus 12 verse one.
[2:23] So we've gone through two uh
[2:26] foreshadowings. Good to see brother
[2:27] Mercy feeling better brother.
[2:29] Hallelujah. God bless. Well you and
[2:30] Austin are doing better. So is Jen. All
[2:31] three that were sicker now back here. So
[2:34] thank the Lord for that. I have a few
[2:35] slides here. Uh let's go to Exodus uh 12
[2:40] verse one. We'll just read the first 14
[2:42] verses here and just look at the types
[2:44] and the shadows you can see of the
[2:46] Lord's supper. Praise God. And I put on
[2:48] the calendar out there, we'll have the
[2:49] Lord's supper there the first weekend in
[2:51] June or July rather uh by God's grace.
[2:54] So we look forward to that. As we know
[2:56] every opportunity uh to go to the house
[2:58] of the Lord is a spiritual communion.
[3:00] Praise God. So Exodus 12. And did
[3:03] anybody see the uh the flood of cares of
[3:05] this life coming this week? And my my my
[3:08] job was really busy. You know, we
[3:09] preached on the flood, you know, on uh
[3:11] Sunday with the flood, the natural and
[3:12] the spiritual. The enemy comes in like a
[3:14] a flood, but I found this too. The
[3:16] spirit of God raised a standard against
[3:18] it. Praise God. So, we're thankful for
[3:20] that. Hallelujah. Exodus
[3:23] 12:1. So, here this is a foreshadowing
[3:25] of uh the communion. And the Lord spake
[3:28] unto Moses and Aaron in the land of
[3:30] Egypt, saying, "This month shall be unto
[3:32] you the beginning of months." This was
[3:33] either end of March, early April because
[3:36] it changes as the the patterns change of
[3:38] the moon and so forth and the time it
[3:41] takes for the sun to get around I'm
[3:43] sorry the earth to get around the sun.
[3:45] Here it says it shall be the first month
[3:47] of the year to you. So this started a
[3:49] new spiritual year uh by God's grace.
[3:52] And then we can see what does communion
[3:53] start for us? A new time to serve God.
[3:56] Hallelujah. Feel like everything's
[3:57] fresh, everything's forgiven. We feel
[3:59] like we have a new start with the Lord.
[4:01] That's why communion is so special.
[4:02] Praise God. Verse three, speak ye unto
[4:05] all the congregation of Israel, saying,
[4:06] In the 10th day of this month, they
[4:08] shall take to them every man a lamb,
[4:10] according to the house of their fathers,
[4:12] a lamb for an house. So, one lamb for
[4:16] the house. And if the household be too
[4:18] little for the lamb, let him and his
[4:20] neighbor next unto his house take it
[4:22] according to the number of the souls.
[4:24] Every man according to the eating shall
[4:26] make your count for the lamb. Your lamb
[4:29] shall be without blemish. We know Christ
[4:32] was without blemish. Hallelujah. A male
[4:34] of the first year, he shall ye shall
[4:37] take it out of the sheep or from the
[4:39] goats. And ye shall keep it up until the
[4:42] 14th day of the same month. And the
[4:44] whole assembly of the congregation of
[4:46] Israel shall kill it in the evening.
[4:48] Now, if you stop right there, it was
[4:51] killed on the 14th at the evening time.
[4:53] That's exactly the day Jesus died.
[4:56] Scholars say that uh as as Jesus was
[4:59] dying on the cross there in the temple,
[5:01] the priests were offering the
[5:03] sacrificial lamb for Passover at exactly
[5:05] the same time. So you had the ant you
[5:08] had the type uh in the temple, the type
[5:10] and then you have the anti-ype Jesus
[5:13] Christ dying for sins. Praise God. Isn't
[5:15] God perfect with his timing? Hallelujah.
[5:17] His types and shadows are just perfect.
[5:20] And yet most of them are blind. Most of
[5:21] most of them are shouting crucify him.
[5:23] Crucified him. But there it was. God's
[5:25] provided lamb. Amen. God's provided lamb
[5:27] right there in front of them. And they
[5:29] missed it. Thank God we haven't missed
[5:30] it. Hallelujah.
[5:32] Hallelujah. That's right.
[5:34] Now verse uh go down there. Verse seven.
[5:38] And they shall take of the blood and
[5:39] strike it upon the two sideposts and on
[5:41] the upper door of the houses wherein
[5:44] they shall eat it. So it's got to have
[5:46] at least three supposed to have right
[5:48] three stripes, right? Like
[5:49] justification, sanctification, the
[5:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost, right? And
[5:52] then the house is cleaned out.
[5:53] Hallelujah. The house will be protected.
[5:56] The death angel, spiritual death can't
[5:58] get to the house because of the blood.
[6:00] Hallelujah. The token, the token's been
[6:02] applied. It's a public display, right?
[6:04] It's a public display of the life of
[6:06] God. That's why brother Ram uses this
[6:07] text for the token. The baptism of the
[6:10] Holy Ghost. If you want to leave Egypt,
[6:12] you got to have the token. Hallelujah.
[6:15] If you want to leave this world in the
[6:16] rapture, got to have the token. Amen.
[6:18] Beautiful type here. Ain't it a
[6:19] beautiful type? Hallelujah. Bye.
[6:23] And then he says verse 8, now here's
[6:25] where we get to the the archetype. And
[6:27] they shall eat the flesh in that night,
[6:29] roast with fire un and unleaven bread
[6:32] and with bitter herbs they shall eat. So
[6:36] again, we see the bitterness of this as
[6:38] well. In other words, it's an
[6:39] examination time, right? Sometimes it's
[6:41] not so pleasant. If we're going through
[6:43] battles or struggles or difficult times
[6:44] of life, communion can be a bitter thing
[6:46] too because we we've gone through
[6:49] things. It's been difficult or maybe
[6:51] we're struggling with individual battles
[6:52] in our lives and it can seem like such a
[6:54] bitter thing. But it's also good to
[6:56] remember Jesus died a bitter death for
[6:58] us. Hallelujah. But here we have the
[7:01] first uh uh the first point about
[7:04] eating. So it's eating in this night,
[7:07] right? Roasting with fire. Unleaven
[7:09] bread speaks of course of the Lord Jesus
[7:11] who was unleavened. No sin on the Lord
[7:14] Jesus. But it also tells us we need to
[7:17] confess our sins, right? And the time of
[7:19] communion. So we get this. We get all
[7:22] these ideas tying together, right?
[7:24] Hallelujah. This is all pointing to the
[7:26] future communion. Hallelujah. And
[7:28] remember Moses was 1500 years before
[7:30] Christ. And then from Christ to us is
[7:32] 2,000. So 3,500 years ago, God is
[7:35] showing us what we need to be doing in
[7:38] this hour. Amen. Having communion.
[7:40] Hallelujah. Verse N. Eat not of it raw,
[7:44] nor soden at all with water, but roast
[7:46] with fire, his head with his legs, and
[7:48] with the pertinence thereof. And ye
[7:51] shall let none nothing of it remain
[7:53] until the morning. That's why when we
[7:55] have leftover communion, I share it with
[7:56] the
[7:57] brethren. And that which remainth of it
[7:59] until the morning, you shall burn with
[8:01] fire. And thus shall ye eat, I'm sorry,
[8:04] eat it with your loins girded, your
[8:06] shoes on your feet, and your staff in
[8:08] your hand, and you shall eat it in
[8:10] haste. It is the Lord's Passover.
[8:14] Hallelujah. So, look how you eat it. You
[8:15] look you you got to eat it with some
[8:17] haste. You got to eat it quickly, right?
[8:20] Because we're getting ready to leave.
[8:21] Hallelujah. You got to eat the word
[8:24] quickly because we're ready to go on a
[8:25] journey. We're leaving Egypt. Praise
[8:27] God. Right? In fact, we're leaving this
[8:29] night. So they had to have all the sin
[8:32] out and they got to be ready to move.
[8:33] Loins gerta means you're ready to move.
[8:35] You're ready to travel long distance.
[8:37] Praise God. And church, isn't that what
[8:38] we do? We have communion. We got to go
[8:40] right back out in the world. Keep
[8:41] traveling. Hallelujah. Right. Don't get
[8:43] tired. Don't stop. We're leaving this
[8:45] world one day or another. Praise God.
[8:48] One day or another, this will be our
[8:49] final communion that we have naturally,
[8:51] right? And then we'll move on to the
[8:53] next life. Hallelujah. So, we can see
[8:55] all these beautiful foreshadowings here.
[8:57] Verse 12. For I will pass through the
[8:58] land of Egypt this night, and will smite
[9:00] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
[9:02] both man the beast, and against all the
[9:04] gods of Egypt, I will execute judgment.
[9:06] I am the Lord. And the blood shall be to
[9:09] you for a token. That's right. Upon the
[9:12] houses where you are, and when I see the
[9:14] blood, I will pass over you. Oh, thank
[9:16] God. I Oh, may may God see the blood of
[9:19] Christ on my life today. Hallelujah.
[9:21] That's more that's what I want more than
[9:23] anything, right, Brother Claude and
[9:24] Patrick? I that's what I want. I want
[9:26] Jesus to see his blood on me.
[9:28] Hallelujah. How do I know it's on me?
[9:30] Because his words in my heart.
[9:32] Hallelujah. Amen.
[9:35] Yes. Now, uh, verse 14. And this shall
[9:38] be unto you for a memorial. See, again,
[9:40] this is a memorial. That's what this is.
[9:42] That's what communion is for us. It's a
[9:44] memorial. We're remembering what Jesus
[9:46] did. Hallelujah. And then Israel was
[9:49] going to remember what God did bringing
[9:50] them out of Egypt. Praise God.
[9:53] Hallelujah. And you shall keep it in a
[9:55] feast to the Lord throughout your
[9:56] generations. You shall keep it a feast
[10:00] by an ordinance forever. So who is this
[10:02] really for? This is to honor the Lord.
[10:05] This when we have communion, it's to
[10:07] make sure we're living lives that are
[10:09] worthy of the gospel. Unleaven lives.
[10:12] Hallelujah. We're eating on the word of
[10:14] God. All right. So now let's go to the
[10:16] fourth one. The covenant meal. Exodus
[10:18] 24:8.
[10:20] So we're still in
[10:24] Exodus. So remember the ten commandments
[10:26] were given in chapter 20 there on Mount
[10:28] Si. 21 we're given the law uh different
[10:32] laws here and
[10:34] 22 and 23 more laws. And here we get 24.
[10:38] This is the order of worship uh pending
[10:40] the building of the tabernacle. We're
[10:42] going to go to verses 8 through 11.
[10:46] And Moses took the blood and sprinkled
[10:48] it on the people and said, "Behold, the
[10:50] blood of the covenant which the Lord had
[10:52] made with you concerning all these
[10:54] words." So, did you catch that? When
[10:56] they were joined to the covenant, they
[10:58] had to be sprinkled with blood. The
[11:01] blood actually had to be on you. So,
[11:03] first it had to be on your house, then
[11:04] it's got to be on you. Amen. I like
[11:07] that. Amen. Let the word of God be on my
[11:09] house, and then let the blood be on me
[11:11] as well. Hallelujah. just let everything
[11:13] in my life be covered with the blood of
[11:15] Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen.
[11:19] And remember, I don't have I I think the
[11:21] verse is uh just hold your place there,
[11:23] but I think it's uh second Peter chapter
[11:25] 1 where the Bible said we're sprinkled.
[11:27] Now, it's just coming to me now because
[11:28] I preached the waters of separation
[11:30] where we're sprinkled with the blood of
[11:32] Jesus. Peter says, so Peter picked up
[11:34] this type here. So, let me see if I can
[11:36] get that. Second Peter, I think it's
[11:37] second Peter chapter 1, right at the
[11:39] beginning of the book if I'm not
[11:40] mistaken.
[11:49] No, maybe it's first
[11:52] Peter. Oh, yes. Thank you, hun. Great
[11:54] job. Thank you. Yeah, I was it right
[11:57] chapter, wrong book. Thank you. Awesome.
[12:01] Yes. Very good. Huh? Yep. Verse two.
[12:03] elect according to the fornowledge of
[12:05] God the Father through sanctification of
[12:08] the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling
[12:11] of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto
[12:13] you and peace be multiplied. Hallelujah.
[12:16] So the first time they were joined the
[12:18] covenant, they were sprinkled by the
[12:20] blood in the Old Testament. What does
[12:21] the Bible say? Peter says that's
[12:24] happened also in the New Testament.
[12:26] You're sprinkled with the blood of Jesus
[12:27] Christ. In other words, when you first
[12:28] become a Christian, God identifies you.
[12:31] He puts his spirit on you. Praise God.
[12:34] Remember we talked about that you you
[12:36] are led by the spirit. As soon as you're
[12:37] saved, as soon as you have faith, you're
[12:39] sprinkled, right? Sprinkled by the
[12:41] blood. You're his. You're joined to the
[12:42] covenant. But what does God do? Is God
[12:44] done with you? No. He's taking you to
[12:46] the promised land. Hallelujah. You're
[12:48] not going to stay at Mount Si. You're
[12:50] going to keep traveling and you're going
[12:51] to cross over Jordan. Hallelujah. And
[12:54] love is the charity or love is the
[12:56] crossing over into Jordan. Praise God.
[12:59] But see, there's a spiritual sprinkling,
[13:01] right? And we kind of get that idea of
[13:03] also the water with water baptism. So
[13:06] see how there's a connection there,
[13:07] sprinkle, but not with blood, physical
[13:08] blood, but with the Holy Spirit. Praise
[13:10] God. We also have the water connection
[13:12] with water baptism. All right. So we see
[13:15] the overlapping here. Verse 9. Then went
[13:17] up Moses and Aaron and Naab and Abaiu
[13:20] and the 70 of the elders of Israel, and
[13:23] they saw the God of Israel, and there
[13:24] was under his feet as it were a paved
[13:26] work for a sapphire stone. Oh, that same
[13:28] picture there in heaven in the book of
[13:30] Revelation and the book of Ezekiel.
[13:32] Hallelujah. And as it were the body of
[13:35] heaven in his
[13:37] clearness. And I'll go to 11. And upon
[13:39] the nobles of the children of Israel, he
[13:41] laid not his hand. Also they saw God and
[13:44] did eat and drink. So again, we get this
[13:48] idea here where uh the people are
[13:51] sprinkled, right? But then the leaders
[13:52] go up to God and they eat and drink with
[13:55] God. another opportunity of communion
[13:57] with God. Hallelujah. So, we have
[13:59] Abraham twice. Uh we had uh the Passover
[14:04] meal, all of Israel, and now here you
[14:06] have Moses, Aaron, and the leaders. They
[14:08] go up, they eat and drink to have
[14:11] communion with God. Like I told you a
[14:13] few weeks ago, if God would do anything
[14:14] with you, what do you want to do? He
[14:15] didn't want to eat with you. He want to
[14:18] share a meal with you and fellowship,
[14:20] right? Sit down and eat and fellowship.
[14:23] That's what God wants to do and that's
[14:24] what God does with us every day when we
[14:26] fellowship with God. Hallelujah. We get
[14:28] to talk talk to our Lord. Hallelujah.
[14:31] Now the fifth and final one was the
[14:32] bread of his face. So let's go to
[14:34] numbers 4:7. This is what I wrote my
[14:36] second book on. Um these numbers have to
[14:39] mean something. And then when I went and
[14:41] counted there was 12 12 uh doctrines
[14:44] that are called mysteries in the New
[14:45] Testament. There's 27 verses that say
[14:47] mystery in the New Testament. 12 of them
[14:49] are actual doctrines and
[14:51] teachings. So we can see it plainly here
[14:54] in the word. So numbers
[15:01] 4:7 and the Bible calls this the bread
[15:04] of his face in the Hebrew
[15:07] 47. And upon the table of shoebread they
[15:10] shall spread a cloth of blue and put
[15:11] thereon on the dishes and the spoons and
[15:13] the bowls and the covers to cover with
[15:16] all. and the continual bread shall be
[15:18] thereon. I'm not going to spend a whole
[15:20] lot of time on this, but I just want to
[15:21] show uh Oh, yeah. There's the verse
[15:23] right there. The picture again. I just
[15:25] pulled them up here. I had this ready
[15:26] for Rod because I don't know if how
[15:28] familiar he is with this, but there's
[15:29] the 12 loaves, six on one side, six on
[15:31] the other. I'm not going to read this,
[15:33] but Brother Brand talks about how his
[15:34] message is these fresh uh pieces of
[15:37] bread. And that's why I put all these
[15:39] quotes together. These have to be the
[15:40] mystery doctrines because that's what we
[15:42] feed on the word of God, right? So, I
[15:44] just put these all together. You can
[15:46] look at it. The unveiling of God. Yeah.
[15:47] 1964, June 14th, morning service. He
[15:50] just goes through it, lays it out. Then
[15:51] he ties in with Revelation 10, right?
[15:53] All the mysteries of God are finished.
[15:56] There's 12 mysteries. Praise God. I
[15:58] don't know how people don't see it, but
[15:59] anyway. And then that's what there's the
[16:02] simple definitions of each one. I preach
[16:03] those to you. But I just want to again
[16:06] show you it was right in there, right?
[16:07] And these three realms represent the
[16:09] three parts of man.
[16:11] Uh in the na in the natural you had the
[16:14] blood and water out here. Blood, water,
[16:16] you had candlesticks, which this shows
[16:18] the church, you're the light of the
[16:20] world, right? Light is knowledge. You
[16:22] have prayer. And then you have the bread
[16:24] or the uh the mysteries of God. In the
[16:26] holies of holies, you have the the law,
[16:28] the mana, and the rod. Okay? And I just
[16:32] did a bit bigger picture there to see
[16:33] those
[16:35] things. Okay? Now, I'm not going to go
[16:36] through that. We know how man's three
[16:38] parts. Uh I think I'm going to pull this
[16:41] up there. Yeah. So for Israel it was
[16:44] natural but for the believer we have the
[16:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost. We have
[16:48] sanctification the holy place by the
[16:50] knowledge, the word and prayer. Okay. So
[16:53] knowledge is the candlesticks and the
[16:56] word is the bread. And then the outer
[16:58] court you had justification which was
[16:59] water baptism. Praise God. And the
[17:01] sprinkling of the blood. Right.
[17:03] Hallelujah. That's right. So it's a
[17:05] beautiful picture here. And so every
[17:07] service I was showing this, you know,
[17:09] I've been a couple years since I
[17:10] preaches, but every service we remember
[17:11] Jesus' blood sacrifice, substitution,
[17:14] and death. We got to confess all sins
[17:15] out here with the waters of separation
[17:17] before you can even get in here. Confess
[17:19] all your sins before church, right? Then
[17:21] you can enjoy the blood. Then you can
[17:22] enjoy the the death of Christ and be
[17:24] thankful for it. Then when you get into
[17:26] the human spirit, you get the oil and
[17:28] light, the bread of mysteries, the
[17:30] incense of prayer, and then the
[17:32] communion with God, talking with God is
[17:35] right there in the soul. Praise God.
[17:37] Happens in the soul.
[17:39] Hallelujah. Thank God. Now, the last
[17:42] one, the fifth one is Psalm
[17:46] 41:9, church. This one's not uh very fun
[17:50] to talk about, but what we see is that
[17:52] sometimes at communion, we're betrayed
[17:54] at communion, which means people will
[17:56] take it, but their lives are still
[17:58] dirty. And we've just seen it recently
[18:00] in our church because people can take
[18:03] communion and be unrepentant of sin.
[18:07] Right? 41
[18:10] verse9. Yay. My own familiar friend in
[18:12] whom I trusted which did eat of my bread
[18:15] hath lifted up his heel against me. Now
[18:18] I'm not calling anybody Judas a scar,
[18:21] but I'm just saying this happens at the
[18:22] table. If people don't take into
[18:25] consideration the scripture, if they
[18:26] don't examine themselves, then they'll
[18:29] partake of communion with the wrong
[18:31] heart.
[18:33] Hallelujah. We got to have pure hearts
[18:36] when we partake of communion.
[18:38] Hallelujah. Right. And every tree is
[18:41] known by its fruit. Hallelujah. That's
[18:44] right. So, in other words, as time
[18:45] passes on, we all get to see the fruits
[18:48] of everybody's actions. Well, what
[18:49] happened since this happened? What
[18:51] happened since that happened? We all get
[18:53] to see who had the real fruit of the
[18:54] Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. Who took
[18:57] communion and has uh the right fruits of
[19:00] the spirit now that they've taken it.
[19:02] Hallelujah. So, we're thankful for that.
[19:04] Praise God. Now, those are the five uh
[19:06] and I did that last week. Okay. Now, I'm
[19:07] going to switch over here. Uh go to 1
[19:09] Corinthians
[19:10] 12:1. I just pulled up some old notes. I
[19:13] haven't preached this on for six years.
[19:14] I haven't preached on this on the gifts
[19:15] of the spirit. So, I want to preach I
[19:17] wanted to get to that today by God's
[19:18] grace. Awesome. We've been talking about
[19:19] the gifts. So, I thought I because of
[19:21] that, I thought this would be inspired.
[19:23] Hallelujah. Uh 1 Corinthians 12. And
[19:26] because you know what happened with my
[19:27] wife and the the C-section, I felt like
[19:30] one of the midwives had a word of wisdom
[19:32] for us. I felt like because I was
[19:33] praying those whole uh all those days I
[19:36] was praying the two days of the and just
[19:38] asking God for wisdom and understanding.
[19:40] And then my wife even testified it too.
[19:42] We felt like our the 80year-old midwife
[19:44] gave us a word of wisdom. It was really
[19:46] really wonderful. And how do you know?
[19:49] because you judge the fruits of it. What
[19:50] happened with that word? You look at it.
[19:53] Was it the good fruit or bad fruit?
[19:56] That's right. 1 Corinthians 12:1. All
[19:58] right. So, we finally got out of chapter
[20:00] 11.
[20:01] Hallelujah.
[20:03] Glory. Verse one. Now, concerning
[20:05] spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not
[20:07] have you ignorant. Now, it's really it's
[20:08] really important because uh we're going
[20:10] to see here in chapter 14. We see why
[20:12] it's so important not to be ignorant. If
[20:15] you're ignorant of spiritual things,
[20:17] then you put all the emphasis on unknown
[20:19] tongues. That's what they were doing.
[20:20] But Paul's got to say, "No, no, no, no.
[20:22] You have at least three, three at the
[20:24] most." And then they got to have
[20:26] interpretation. See, if you don't have
[20:29] uh if you're ignorant of it, you're just
[20:31] going to have a lot of
[20:32] confusion. Right? Now, our our church,
[20:35] of course, doesn't have a lot of those
[20:36] operating at this time, nor have we ever
[20:39] had a lot operating. But that's not
[20:41] what's uh part that that's not the
[20:43] requirement to be a Holy Ghost fil
[20:45] believer to have the gifts operating all
[20:46] the time.
[20:48] Right? We let them operate when God
[20:51] wants to operate them. Praise God.
[20:53] Right? Hallelujah. And we know tongues
[20:55] is the least of the gifts. Hallelujah.
[20:57] But when people think of gifts, they
[20:58] automatically think tongues, but it's
[20:59] actually the least of the gifts. And
[21:02] wisdom is needed first to judge all the
[21:04] other ones. Hallelujah.
[21:07] And then we know, of course, there's a
[21:08] time and season for all gifts.
[21:10] Hallelujah. And then we also know, I
[21:12] can't add one gift to my stature, nor
[21:14] can you. But what we can do is put
[21:16] ourselves in position of the Holy Spirit
[21:18] and then let God use us at the right
[21:20] time and season. Hallelujah. Amen. 12
[21:24] verse two. Ye know that ye were Gentiles
[21:26] carried away unto these dumb idols, even
[21:30] as ye were led. So don't be ignorant of
[21:33] gifts. used to be just led away with
[21:35] dumb idols. Verse three, wherefore I
[21:37] give you to understand that no man
[21:39] speaking by the spirit of God calleth
[21:41] Jesus a curse. So nobody can curse Jesus
[21:45] uh by the Holy Spirit. Okay? You can't
[21:48] say Jesus cursed by the Holy Spirit. The
[21:50] Holy Spirit won't say that. Hallelujah.
[21:52] And that no man can say that Jesus is
[21:55] the Lord but by the Holy Ghost.
[21:58] Okay. Now, with this one, Brother Bam
[22:00] says what that means is a Holy
[22:01] Ghostfilled person because anybody any
[22:04] any church member can say, "I believe
[22:06] Jesus is Lord." Right? But that doesn't
[22:08] mean they're born again. Brother Bam
[22:10] says, I read before the service, Brother
[22:12] Bam says, "This is speaking of someone
[22:13] who's born again."
[22:16] Hallelujah. Because even the devils,
[22:19] that's even the devils know Jesus as the
[22:21] holy one. Right? But here the Bible says
[22:24] man. Right? But then Jesus said many
[22:26] will say Lord, Lord, right? Right? And
[22:28] he'll say, "I never knew
[22:30] you." Okay? So, there's a balance here.
[22:32] What Paul's saying, he's talking about
[22:33] spiritual gifts.
[22:36] Hallelujah. Glory. Now, verse four. Now,
[22:39] here's what I put up here. I want to put
[22:40] the Greek definitions up here to kind of
[22:42] give an understanding, a little bit
[22:43] deeper understanding. Now, there are
[22:45] diversities of gifts, but the same
[22:46] spirit. So, diversities means
[22:48] differences. There's differences of
[22:50] gifts. So, there's nine different ones,
[22:52] right? That's what he's going to
[22:53] explain. Now, before the church, can you
[22:55] imagine before he wrote this, none of
[22:57] the churches knew how many gifts there
[22:58] were, right? Who knew? I didn't know. If
[23:02] you read the Old Testament, how many
[23:03] gifts could you come up with? I don't
[23:05] know. Probably nine. But you I mean,
[23:06] they're not laid out like this here.
[23:08] There Paul lays them out beautifully by
[23:10] the uncction of the Holy Spirit. So, for
[23:12] us, yeah, it's common knowledge. How
[23:13] many gifts? Nine. Oh, yeah. That's for
[23:15] us. That's not that that's easy because
[23:17] we've had the Bible for our whole lives.
[23:19] But now Paul's going to say there's not
[23:21] just one gift. There's actually nine
[23:23] gifts. Hallelujah. Now verse five, there
[23:27] are differences of
[23:29] administrations but the same Lord. Okay.
[23:33] So there's different administration
[23:34] means services. There's different kinds
[23:36] of services regarding these gifts. Okay.
[23:41] For example, uh which one serves the
[23:44] most people in the church? Prophecy.
[23:47] Remember that's what Paul said in
[23:48] chapter 14. Prophecy serves to benefit
[23:51] everybody because everybody hears it.
[23:53] Thus sayith the Lord, this is going to
[23:54] happen. It comes to pass. Oh my, God's
[23:56] among us. Hallelujah. That's a rare
[23:58] thing, but for us it's dreams, right? A
[24:00] lot of times for us was it's dreams.
[24:02] Hallelujah. Or even a word of faith like
[24:04] we have with sister Naomi, right? Told
[24:07] us what was going to happen before it
[24:09] happened. And there's a lot of things
[24:11] that could have happened that didn't
[24:13] happen. Hallelujah.
[24:16] See, and that benefits everybody to know
[24:18] that God's among us. Hallelujah.
[24:22] Now, but in a tongue that that would
[24:24] serve if it's just for one person, that
[24:26] will really edify that person, but that
[24:28] might not edify me if I didn't speak in
[24:30] the tongue. So, you see how it serves
[24:31] different purposes.
[24:33] More people are edified, fewer people
[24:35] are edified, but we need all the gifts.
[24:37] Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory.
[24:41] Verse six. Now there are diversities of
[24:44] operations or
[24:46] working but it's the same God which
[24:49] workketh all in all. Okay? So they work
[24:52] differently. Now brother Ram tells us
[24:54] this. He says a man like or Roberts
[24:56] would have bulldog faith and you if you
[24:58] ever go watch one of his videos he sits
[25:00] on a chair right at right at the right
[25:02] at the pulpit at the platform and he
[25:04] sits on a chair and these people come up
[25:05] one at a time and he takes their head
[25:06] like their forehead and he goes like
[25:08] this with bulldog brother said bulldog
[25:10] faith.
[25:12] Right? And they had great testimonies.
[25:13] He had a lot of wonderful testimonies.
[25:14] Brother said he had bulldog faith and
[25:16] he's yelling and and and rebuking Satan
[25:19] with a loud voice. And yet, brother Ram
[25:20] would go up and just lay hands on Satan.
[25:22] Satan, I rebuke you in the name of
[25:25] Jesus. Get your hands off of God's
[25:27] property. Satan, I adjure thee by the
[25:29] the blood of Jesus
[25:31] Christ. Both have good testimonies of
[25:33] healing, but it's a different way it
[25:36] works. The church said, "Hallelujah. How
[25:39] about the How about the the dots in the
[25:42] hand? Wasn't that different? That's a
[25:44] different kind of a
[25:45] work. Hallelujah. How about How about
[25:48] David playing his harp and then the evil
[25:50] spirits are cast out of
[25:52] Saul. So singing, right? Some of them
[25:55] work through singing. How about David?
[25:57] And not only that, David singing and
[25:59] then he says, "My God, my God, there's
[26:00] prophecy working through songs."
[26:03] Amen. Hallelujah.
[26:06] So see there's different services who it
[26:08] serves and there's different way it
[26:10] works.
[26:12] Hallelujah. Some people will get Yeah.
[26:14] Some people get the dream. Some people
[26:16] just get a like a a faith will drop on
[26:18] them and they'll just speak it. I know
[26:19] it's going to happen. How about speaking
[26:22] the word, right? Speaking to the
[26:24] mountain.
[26:26] It works a different way, doesn't it?
[26:30] For for the times it's happened in my
[26:31] life, I haven't thought about it. I've
[26:33] just spoken to it. But when I'm thinking
[26:35] about it, then I don't speak it because
[26:36] I know that's my thought, not God's
[26:38] thought.
[26:40] Hallelujah. That's one way I know. If
[26:42] I'm thinking about it and I and I'm
[26:44] wondering, Austin, do I say it or not?
[26:45] You know, Lord, do I? Then I don't.
[26:48] I want to get caught up in the spirit so
[26:50] that I'll just flow out. Praise God.
[26:53] Hallelujah. So, each person has to find
[26:57] uh which gift they have, right? which
[26:59] are the different ones, how many people
[27:01] it's going to serve and then how it's
[27:03] going to work as well.
[27:07] Okay, same God works in all. Isn't that
[27:10] awesome? God can work through oral
[27:11] Roberts, you know, not of course he he
[27:13] got off at the end of his life, but you
[27:15] know, he could just shake their
[27:16] foreheads and God would bring healing.
[27:18] Brother Ram could just pray in a nice
[27:19] gentle way and God would heal both.
[27:22] God's a God of variety. Hallelujah.
[27:25] Amen. Verse n verse seven. Now seven is
[27:28] good for uh the godhead. Okay. But the
[27:31] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[27:33] every man to profit with all. Now we say
[27:37] God is three manifestations. And here's
[27:39] the verse for
[27:41] it. The manifestation of the Holy
[27:45] Spirit. So Jesus is called a
[27:48] manifestation because it's God appearing
[27:49] in a flesh body. The Holy Spirit is a
[27:52] manifestation because it's God in each
[27:54] one of
[27:55] us.
[27:57] Hallelujah. But if you ask me, is the
[27:59] Holy Spirit a manifestation? I would
[28:00] say, well, well, in one way it is in our
[28:02] lives. But is the Holy Spirit a
[28:04] manifestation? Another way, no. The Holy
[28:05] Spirit is
[28:07] God. But in this context, it's a
[28:09] manifestation in our lives through the
[28:11] gifts of the Holy Spirit. Because what
[28:13] do we have? We have God above us,
[28:14] father, right? God above us, God with
[28:16] us, Jesus. But now God is what? in us.
[28:20] Father, Son, Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[28:24] Make sense? And that this is where this
[28:27] verse comes in so powerfully. Verse
[28:28] seven, because I know because I was
[28:30] debating that Trinitarian guy and he
[28:32] says, "You call them persons." I said,
[28:34] "The Bible calls them
[28:35] manifestations." So, what what can you
[28:37] do, Austin? You can just change the
[28:38] subject because he he has no answer. But
[28:42] the Bible gives us the right words.
[28:44] Hallelujah. The Bible gives us the right
[28:46] words, the right doctrine, and gives us
[28:48] the truth.
[28:50] Hallelujah.
[28:52] And uh and let's all say every man.
[28:54] Ready? Every man. See, every believer
[28:56] has a gift. Even the lost ones because
[28:57] Judas had gifts.
[29:00] Even our lost friends have gifts of the
[29:03] spirit. Right? If they'll just yield to
[29:05] them. If they would just yield to them,
[29:08] then God would use them. That's right.
[29:11] Look at Balam. He was lost. He went to
[29:13] hell. Did he have a gift? Yes. He was a
[29:15] prophet. Everybody thinking real deep
[29:17] now, huh?
[29:20] sinners. Sinners if they can even just
[29:22] get a temporary uh time where they're
[29:24] walking lightly before God, the spirit
[29:26] of God can come on them. Just like Baum,
[29:28] he knew how to sacrifice. He knew how to
[29:30] worship God, right? The spirit of God
[29:33] can come on them, use them for a gift,
[29:35] and then they could turn away from that
[29:37] spirit, and the evil devils will come
[29:38] right back on them. Yes. Hallelujah.
[29:43] every man. That's why the Bible said no
[29:45] man will be without
[29:46] excuse because God would I I believe
[29:49] this is just my thought here. This is my
[29:50] thought. I believe God would have
[29:52] manifested to every person that they had
[29:54] a gift. In other words, some amazing
[29:56] testimony uh some prophecy or something
[29:58] that happened in their lives, some some
[30:01] dream or something, right? God, the
[30:02] Bible said God works through dreams.
[30:04] Praise God in the book of Job to seal up
[30:06] their understanding. Praise God.
[30:09] showing people all these things who
[30:11] they're they're not going to be able to
[30:12] deny it. Hallelujah. He gives it to
[30:15] every man. But for us, it's going to
[30:18] profit us when the gifts of the spirit
[30:22] move. Okay. Verse eight. For to one is
[30:26] given by the spirit the word of
[30:28] wisdom, to another the word of knowledge
[30:31] by the same spirit. Okay. So wisdom,
[30:34] knowledge. To another faith by the same
[30:37] spirit. Yes. To another the gifts of
[30:39] healing. So gifts there again. You see
[30:41] there's many types of gifts of healing
[30:43] by the same spirit. To another the
[30:45] working of miracles, to another
[30:47] prophecy, to another discerning of
[30:50] spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[30:52] tongues, to another the interpretation
[30:55] of tongues. But all these workketh that
[30:58] one and the self-samed spirit, dividing
[31:00] to every man severally as he will.
[31:04] That's really important. That means I
[31:06] can't speak in tonesues unless God gave
[31:08] it to me. Amen. Right? That's why I
[31:11] don't feel bad if there's no tongues.
[31:12] And and Pentecostals say, "Well, when
[31:14] was the last time you spoke in
[31:15] tonesues?" It doesn't bother me because
[31:16] I can't give myself a gift. Amen. All I
[31:19] can do is lay myself before God, pray,
[31:22] repent, uh study the word, draw close to
[31:24] God, get under the spirit, and when God
[31:26] wants to move, God's going to move.
[31:28] Praise God. That's all we can do.
[31:31] Hallelujah. But see, they put pressure
[31:33] on and then they they basically a lot of
[31:35] them just make up fake tongues is what
[31:37] they do. And the reason, you know, is
[31:39] because their lives aren't cleaned out
[31:40] and there's no interpretation. And if
[31:42] you ask them, I bet a lot of them
[31:43] probably would tell you they're they're
[31:45] making it up because I had a friend tell
[31:47] me that in college. He he and he was
[31:48] crying. Remember I told you his name was
[31:50] Greg. And we were in the hotel room the
[31:52] night before the game out there in
[31:53] Eastern Michigan. And he was just crying
[31:55] like Jesse. The the preacher put the
[31:57] microphone right in front of my face and
[31:58] said, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit?"
[31:59] He said, "Yes." He said, "Then speak in
[32:01] tongues." And Greg's like, "I was
[32:03] nervous, so I just faked it." Yeah. And
[32:06] he cried. I said, "Well, God will
[32:08] forgive you because you repented of it."
[32:10] But I said, "Now, can't you see that
[32:12] tongues aren't the evidence?" He's like,
[32:13] "Yeah, that's right." And I got hurt
[32:15] after that. I never had another meeting
[32:16] with him again. He quit the team the
[32:18] next year. So, that was an ordained
[32:19] moment. Hopefully, he's walking with
[32:20] God. Hallelujah. I hurt my shoulder and
[32:23] that's the second time that that bone
[32:24] popped up and then I had to get a
[32:26] surgery and I I never ever spent time
[32:28] with him ever again. That was the last
[32:30] conversation we had was about the Holy
[32:31] Ghost. God knows what he's doing,
[32:33] church. Amen. God knows God's ordering
[32:35] our steps. Now, let's just uh for the
[32:38] remaining time we got here, a few
[32:39] minutes here, let's uh go through a few
[32:42] quotes here by God's grace. And I got
[32:43] one here I want to
[32:46] share. Now, remember, we're to follow
[32:48] charity and then
[32:50] desire the gifts. So, our full desire
[32:54] should be on the love of God. Are we
[32:56] loving our brothers? Are we loving our
[32:58] sisters? As parents, are we loving our
[33:00] children? Praise God.
[33:02] Love should be our greatest aim first.
[33:04] Make sure love is flowing out of every
[33:06] channel of our lives. Every relationship
[33:09] should have the love of God in it.
[33:12] Then desire the
[33:14] gifts. Hallelujah. The trouble is what
[33:16] are the churches? They go after gifts
[33:18] and they don't really have love for one
[33:19] another, right? Or even love for God,
[33:22] let alone love for others. They're just
[33:24] gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts. Now,
[33:26] there's a balance because I'm going to
[33:27] get to a quote in just a moment.
[33:29] There's, of course, a balance, but the
[33:30] Bible said, "Follow after charity and
[33:32] desire the spiritual gifts, but rather
[33:35] that ye may prophesy." So, that's one
[33:37] thing I need to put on the prayer list
[33:38] is
[33:39] prophecy.
[33:41] Right? Hopefully, somebody remind me if
[33:43] I don't, we need to put that up there.
[33:44] We need to pray for gifts. We need to
[33:45] pray more often for it. It's not to be
[33:47] our major prayer, but we're to pray for
[33:50] it. Brother Bam tells us to pray for the
[33:53] gifts. And that's one thing maybe uh you
[33:56] know I do pray for miracles of course
[33:57] often but just have more concentrated
[34:00] prayer would be a blessing. Hallelujah.
[34:03] So follow the Holy Ghost love then
[34:05] desire him to move through the gifts.
[34:08] Prayer expresses our desires to God. So
[34:10] we should pray more. Now remember the
[34:12] Bible said even covet them uh as we'll
[34:15] get to. Wherefore brethren covet to
[34:17] prophesy and forbid not to speak with
[34:20] tongues.
[34:21] Hallelujah. Okay. Okay. So that's one
[34:23] thing we got to real that means uh
[34:24] desire not in a sinful way but it means
[34:26] desire prophecy greatly that God would
[34:30] tell us something in the future. How
[34:32] many want to know a secret from God?
[34:33] Hallelujah. I do. My goodness. We want
[34:36] to know a secret and then God can make
[34:38] it known to us through prophecy and then
[34:40] we would be happy, right? We'd be
[34:42] rejoicing. God is with us. Praise God.
[34:45] Now we know God's with us as long as
[34:47] we're confessing our sins as well. But
[34:49] God does desire times to come down just
[34:51] like he did to Abraham, right? He drew
[34:52] near to Abraham and then he left from
[34:54] Abraham. Like we looked at last week,
[34:56] there's times God draws closer and uh
[34:59] then we'd say uh pulls off, we'd say by
[35:02] God's grace, but we're never forsaken.
[35:04] We're never left alone. Amen. That's
[35:07] right. Now, Brother Bam says this in 58.
[35:10] Now, another thing that we believe that
[35:11] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[35:13] to every man to profit with all. Now we
[35:15] believe that when these gifts and so
[35:17] forth are operating in the church which
[35:19] we covet and desire that the people who
[35:21] are gifted by the spirit come and
[35:24] worship with
[35:25] us. Hallelujah. I want people that speak
[35:28] in tongues interpret but I also want
[35:30] people that have wisdom and knowledge.
[35:33] Hallelujah.
[35:34] Yeah, we all want miracle workers, but
[35:36] who wants a discernment of spirit when
[35:38] you're the one who might not have the
[35:39] right spirit?
[35:41] Hallelujah. See, so we got to want all
[35:45] of them. So we got to I got to be
[35:47] careful not to look at this and say,
[35:48] "Oh, miracles or tongues or prophecy."
[35:50] We have to want all the gifts of the
[35:52] Holy Spirit. Okay? We want all them to
[35:55] come worship with us. Now, here's where
[35:57] he says it. Church, look, he says it
[35:58] plainly because the Bible says covet
[36:00] gifts. Brother Ram said, then that means
[36:02] pray for
[36:03] it. Then when you become in the body of
[36:06] Christ, then there's nine spiritual
[36:07] gifts that goes in every local body. And
[36:09] those are gifts that you're going to
[36:11] pray for to pray for the gift of
[36:13] speaking with tongues or the gift of
[36:15] interpretation of tongues or these other
[36:17] other gifts that goes in the church.
[36:18] Pray for the gifts of healing. In other
[36:20] words, when you you pray, right? You
[36:22] pray for miracles. You pray for healing.
[36:24] Pray for the gifts of miracles and so
[36:25] forth. That's the ones that you pray
[36:27] for. And the spirit comes on and works
[36:31] in each local assembly in perfecting the
[36:34] church. Hallelujah. So, this is
[36:37] something that we that's why I love
[36:39] going through these Bible books because
[36:40] it reminds us it brings us back to it.
[36:42] We've already we've all most of us have
[36:44] all read it, right? Jen just started
[36:46] reading the Bible, so she's in Genesis
[36:48] chapter 2. She hasn't read it yet, but
[36:49] she's going to get there. She's in
[36:51] Genesis chapter 2. Yeah, chapter three.
[36:53] Oh, chapter three. Amen. Good job.
[36:56] slowly working our way through the
[36:58] Bible. Hallelujah. But uh but for us,
[37:02] you know, we read all different places
[37:03] in the Bible, right? But it's nice to
[37:05] come back here and remind us we need to
[37:07] pray for the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
[37:12] Hallelujah. Now, uh invest in your gifts
[37:15] once. Okay. So, so now brother Ram is
[37:17] going to say God many times has to has
[37:19] to drive people to gifts. In other
[37:21] words, you don't really want to do it.
[37:22] And I'll give myself as example. I
[37:25] really I knew I always knew I was called
[37:26] to go to the pulpit, but it took me a
[37:28] lot to get up there. People had to
[37:29] really move me to get up there. Right
[37:32] now, it's like I just I can't get away
[37:33] from it. You know, it's always there.
[37:36] You know, it's always going to be. But
[37:37] to get there, God had to push me and
[37:39] drive me up there, you know, through
[37:40] Brother Tim and different ones like
[37:42] that, Brother Brooks and Brother Craig.
[37:44] They kind of had to push me up there.
[37:46] But I always felt like a pull. I told
[37:47] somebody recently, as soon as I came in
[37:49] the church in a message church, I felt a
[37:51] magnet to the pulpit. But I just waited.
[37:53] I never pushed myself up there. People
[37:55] invite me to pray. People invite me to
[37:57] sing song specials, but I just always
[37:59] felt this magnetic spiritual pull. And
[38:02] now what am I doing the last 19 years?
[38:04] 19 pastor in 19 years.
[38:07] Hallelujah. See, God God vindicates what
[38:10] he puts in your heart. Praise God. In
[38:12] other words, that that gift in your
[38:13] heart, God will lead you to use it.
[38:15] Praise God. That's right. And you got to
[38:18] invest in it once God drives you to it.
[38:21] Each one of us has a different ministry.
[38:22] Each one works different, right? Like we
[38:24] read, each one of you has a ministry, a
[38:26] separate ministry. All that comes into
[38:29] Christ has a ministry. That's right. Not
[38:31] only the preacher. Amen, brother
[38:33] Brandham. But you have a ministry to
[38:36] something. Something you can
[38:39] do. You've got something. Everybody's
[38:41] got something they can do. Our sisters
[38:42] especially. Don't feel discouraged. Our
[38:44] sisters have ministries.
[38:46] And your church, you have to look at
[38:48] that. You have to look at church that
[38:50] way. It's not just the song leaders and
[38:52] the preachers. It's everybody has a
[38:54] ministry.
[38:56] When you feel led to go pray for
[38:57] somebody or you feel led to share
[38:59] something, you got to follow that
[39:00] leading.
[39:02] Everybody has a ministry. Or like
[39:04] brother told uh sister Shakaren, maybe
[39:06] your ministry is in fasting, which would
[39:08] be for healing. He said because when you
[39:09] fast, people get healed,
[39:12] right? He said you were Oh, I'm sorry.
[39:14] No, that's right. It was It was somebody
[39:15] else. Somebody else was. He told Sister
[39:17] Saren, "You weren't born to fast."
[39:19] That's right. She wasn't born to fast.
[39:22] She was called to something else. Other
[39:25] people were called to fast. Okay. So,
[39:27] I'm sorry I got that one mixed up. She
[39:28] was the one. She was saying, "Brother B,
[39:29] I fast and pray. Nothing happens." He
[39:31] said, "That's because you weren't b born
[39:32] to fast and
[39:34] pray."
[39:36] Okay. He said, "Not only a preacher, but
[39:39] you have something you can do." And I
[39:41] hope this doesn't sound sacriiggious,
[39:42] but usually God has to drive you into
[39:44] your correct
[39:46] ministry. Right? Usually we see that
[39:49] with Moses, right? Moses ran away from
[39:50] it, right? God had to drive him into the
[39:53] pro being a prophet,
[39:55] right? Paul, right? Paul was uh Paul was
[39:59] chasing down the Christians. Jesus had
[40:01] to knock him down and drive him into it,
[40:03] right? And then blind him just to get
[40:04] him in the ministry,
[40:06] right? What did God have to do with
[40:08] brother Random? Let his wife die, right?
[40:10] Let his child die to get him to finally
[40:11] go out into evangelism. And the church
[40:13] said because of his own failure to do
[40:17] it. That's
[40:19] right. Let me let me pull this up. This
[40:21] might help you. I just I saw this one
[40:25] earlier. Anybody Anybody guess I'd
[40:27] preach on jellyfish
[40:29] tonight? Brother R says, "Sometimes I
[40:32] look at myself and think I've been such
[40:34] a jellyfish in my
[40:36] life."
[40:38] Huh? I would think lion, eagle, lamb.
[40:43] What would you say, brother? Uh,
[40:45] giraffe, something
[40:48] rhinoceros,
[40:50] jellyfish. Now, look, look how humble
[40:52] brother Am is. 19, it's it's 1956. The
[40:56] seals haven't even been broken yet. But
[40:58] look what he's going to say. I have
[41:00] waited many thousand souls into the
[41:03] kingdom. I think I know what he's
[41:05] talking about with some of those. South
[41:07] Africa. Remember when he disobeyed the
[41:09] itinerary of the Lord?
[41:11] the the Lord said, "I'm going to give
[41:13] I'll give you this whole nation." But he
[41:15] he lost out on that whole nation because
[41:17] he
[41:18] disobeyed. Now, that's just my guess. I
[41:20] don't know about that, but I just see a
[41:22] connection there. He missed out on a
[41:24] bigger ministry, at least in South
[41:27] Africa. I've waited and I said, "God,
[41:29] depending too much on a spiritual gift,"
[41:31] said, "Lord, if you'll just show me and
[41:32] you'll give me a vision what to do. And
[41:34] God, give me the vision, then I'll turn
[41:36] around, let somebody talk me into
[41:38] something else." And the church said,
[41:41] See church now church if this doesn't
[41:43] show you brother Ram's human nothing
[41:45] will he prays for a vision God gives it
[41:49] to him and then he doesn't follow
[41:50] through. Sound familiar.
[41:53] God give me a verse. God give me a
[41:55] sermon that's right for me. You get it
[41:57] but then you don't do what you're
[41:58] supposed to do.
[42:01] Amen. I can say amen to that because I'm
[42:04] not perfect. I still fall short of God's
[42:06] glory. But that's not going to stop me.
[42:08] I'm not going to have a worldly sorrow.
[42:10] Let's have a godly sorrow. Praise God.
[42:12] Let's do better the next time.
[42:15] But just remember your prophet called
[42:16] himself a jellyfish. I have a quote,
[42:18] brother Mercy. Brother Brham said he was
[42:20] a son of Kish. Who was a son of Kish?
[42:24] Saul. Brother Brandham humbled him so
[42:26] much himself so much. He said, "Forgive
[42:28] me, Lord. I'm like a son of Kish."
[42:32] Sometimes church, Brother Brand was a
[42:34] humble
[42:35] man. I don't know about you, but I would
[42:36] never call myself a
[42:38] Saul, right?
[42:40] knowing what I know, right? But brother
[42:43] was so humble that I guess maybe I
[42:45] could. If brother did it, maybe I could.
[42:48] When I make a mistake, I'd say, "Lord,
[42:50] forgive me. I feel like such a jellyfish
[42:51] today." What's a jellyfish? No. No. No.
[42:54] Uh vertebrae, right? Did I do I have the
[42:56] science term right? Children, you have
[42:58] vertebrate and invertebrate, right? I'm
[43:00] going back to eighth grade math or
[43:01] eighth grade science. But so no backbone
[43:04] is no stability, right? Just loosey
[43:06] goosey, right? We'd
[43:07] say God gives you something. God gives
[43:10] you a backbone, but you don't take it.
[43:12] God shows you what to do. You don't do
[43:15] it. And look, look at this. This is a
[43:17] gift. It's a vision. A
[43:20] gift. If you'll just give me a vision.
[43:22] If you just give me a prophecy, I'll do
[43:24] it. Would you? If God gave you a vision,
[43:28] if God gave you a tongue, would you
[43:29] speak it?
[43:31] God gave you a word of wisdom, would you
[43:33] go tell the person? Would you?
[43:37] Well, let me Well, let's be honest. You
[43:40] You would want to, but the devil's going
[43:42] to try to fight you to not do
[43:44] it.
[43:46] Hallelujah. So, I thought that that
[43:48] might help us all today. If we were
[43:50] jellyfish this week, let's just say,
[43:51] "Lord, I was a jellyfish. Forgive me.
[43:54] Now, give me a backbone for the kingdom
[43:55] of God." Hallelujah. This is a prophet
[43:59] of God.
[44:01] He says, "And oh, I have never come to
[44:03] the spot yet until I have it this time
[44:05] that I feel it's a faith that we must
[44:07] step out there because it's a
[44:10] promise." So, in other words, he was
[44:12] waiting for a vision. But then he
[44:13] realized, well, some of these are
[44:14] promises in the Bible. I don't need a
[44:16] vision if there's a promise. And the
[44:18] church said, like like the apostles,
[44:21] Jesus said, "Go you therefore, preach to
[44:23] every creature. Go to all nations."
[44:25] Well, that's for the apostle. That's not
[44:26] for the housewife.
[44:28] They'll say like this. That's That's not
[44:29] for the pastor either.
[44:32] If the pastor leaves a church, he's no
[44:34] longer a pastor.
[44:36] Hallelujah. So, it's already written to
[44:38] the apostles, go and preach to all
[44:40] nations.
[44:42] They need you don't you don't need a
[44:43] vision. You've already got thus sayith
[44:45] the word. Hallelujah. That's right. And
[44:48] that's what brother's saying here. He's
[44:49] he said he's realizing on some of these
[44:51] things, I've already got the Bible to
[44:53] tell me that. That's right. Hallelujah.
[44:56] If someone's sick, go lay hands on the
[44:58] sick. they shall recover. And most time
[45:00] they do, church, most of the time. Not
[45:01] every time, but a lot of times among our
[45:04] sick, what does God heals us?
[45:06] Hallelujah.
[45:09] Is that the same quote? Yeah. So, this
[45:11] is the same quote. And he said, "And the
[45:12] things that he's done and the healings
[45:14] that he's performed and the miracles,
[45:15] even so much as come down and have his
[45:17] picture taken by the side of us, the
[45:19] pillar fire 1950 Houston coliseum
[45:22] picture and so forth, which has never
[45:24] been known since the world began." And
[45:25] then stand around like a
[45:28] what? And it even makes me discouraged
[45:30] with myself. Anybody been there before?
[45:33] You get discouraged with your own self.
[45:36] Now, if you haven't, you're probably
[45:38] living in a lot of pride because you
[45:40] just get discouraged with other people.
[45:41] But if you're honest, you get
[45:43] discouraged with yourself.
[45:47] It's time to keep your eye on the
[45:49] promise. And that's why by God's grace,
[45:52] I'm sorry, that's what by God's grace I
[45:54] aim to do. And I realize that every
[45:56] devil of hell will shoot at it. See,
[45:59] once you get to answer your prayer, once
[46:01] you know what to do with a gift, you
[46:02] still got to carry it
[46:04] out,
[46:06] right? But by God's grace, I aim to keep
[46:09] my eye on the promise. What a what a
[46:12] what a testimony. Hallelujah. Lord,
[46:14] whatever you show me by supernatural,
[46:16] whatever you show me, help me just to
[46:18] keep my eyes on
[46:23] that. Now, I don't think I Let me see. I
[46:26] might have the quote.
[46:29] I might have it on
[46:32] here. Yeah. Glory. All right. Amen. So,
[46:36] here's the balance here.
[46:41] Um Yeah. Here's the balance,
[46:45] right? We can never make gifts uh the
[46:49] evidence of the Holy Ghost, right? Like
[46:51] that's what the Pentecostals do. They
[46:52] made tongues the evidence. Okay. Uh some
[46:56] people in the message make it shouting
[46:57] or screaming or dancing. You know, they
[46:59] think, "Okay, now you got the Holy
[47:00] Ghost." But your life's going to prove
[47:02] whether you got it or not.
[47:05] Right? We've seen we've seen people
[47:08] dance in our church and then leave.
[47:11] And not serve God. Some do. Praise God.
[47:15] Some don't. So, was the dancing the
[47:17] evidence? No. It was the evidence the
[47:20] spirit of God was on them and they were
[47:21] joyful. That's the evidence of that. But
[47:23] your life proves what you got.
[47:25] Hallelujah.
[47:26] Right now look, see that's what the
[47:28] matter with the church today. You done
[47:29] got away from that river. God away from
[47:31] the gifts of the spirit. So see this is
[47:32] a good reminder. We just got to stay
[47:34] praying for the gifts of the Holy
[47:35] Spirit. They're not the evidence, but it
[47:38] is evidence God is moving. Hallelujah.
[47:42] It's not evidence. Just because a gift
[47:44] operates doesn't mean it's evidence of
[47:46] someone saved or even born again. Uh,
[47:49] and so we can't make that the evidence
[47:51] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But we
[47:54] do want to pray for the gifts of the
[47:55] spirit to move as evidence he's in our
[47:58] midst. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[48:02] You see, we can't get away from that.
[48:04] See, we can't get away from everything
[48:05] is the same. Every service or every day
[48:07] is just the same. We got to draw nigh to
[48:09] God. And brother says that that happens
[48:12] when you get away from the spirit. They
[48:14] just got a church
[48:16] natural and they get away from the
[48:18] spiritual gifts and the spiritual things
[48:20] and they cast their fruit. What do they
[48:22] do? They're believers. Live with the
[48:24] world, act like the world, steal, cheat,
[48:26] lie, smoke, drink, gamble, have bunko
[48:28] parties in the church to pay the
[48:29] preacher and everything else. Soup,
[48:31] suppers, dances, see, they cast their
[48:32] fruit. It's just like the
[48:35] world. Okay? So, church, by God's grace,
[48:39] we don't have these things, right? But
[48:42] we might we might have some other sins,
[48:44] right? And we try to keep those cleaned
[48:47] out by the grace of
[48:48] God. But I just want to show this. We
[48:51] never want to get away from the gifts of
[48:53] the Holy Spirit. We want to pray for
[48:54] them. Amen. Because each one of you have
[48:58] them
[49:00] Hallelujah.
[49:03] Now, let me I'll close with this one.
[49:04] Let me close. I'm going to close here in
[49:05] the next uh how long have I been going
[49:06] on
[49:07] there? All right. Perfect. Oh, glory.
[49:10] That's good. Just less maybe less than
[49:12] an hour.
[49:15] Okay. Yeah. This is the one I I'm
[49:17] closing with this one. So maybe be less
[49:19] than an hour
[49:20] tonight. Who would have thought,
[49:22] brother? Who would have thought? Is that
[49:24] possible? I just want to share
[49:27] this. As you know, Brother Bam said when
[49:30] we get saved, I'm sorry, when you get
[49:32] saved, it's like you come into a room
[49:34] now. You're saved. Like it's the room of
[49:35] a Christian room. You know, you're
[49:37] amongst believers. And brother Ram said
[49:39] each piece of furniture is like a
[49:41] different gift, right? This is a
[49:44] different gift. That would be a
[49:45] different gift. The chair right here,
[49:47] everything in here is a different gift.
[49:48] And you you might go and be used in that
[49:51] area. Brother Ram said that's an example
[49:53] of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. So in
[49:55] other words, if when you come in a
[49:56] Christian, you got nine chairs
[50:00] and God might have you sit at the nine
[50:01] at all nine chairs or maybe just one
[50:03] chair,
[50:05] right? It's how God wants to use you.
[50:09] Right? So, like I've told I told you all
[50:11] about and I'll go through the examples
[50:12] Lord willing Sunday or next week. My
[50:15] wife and I have had prophetic prayers
[50:17] that came to pass,
[50:20] but I don't have them all the time. So,
[50:22] it's like God let me sit in that chair a
[50:24] couple times, brother Mercy. They said,
[50:26] "Okay, get up. You're going to come over
[50:28] here." And then like then Malachi, I'm
[50:31] just waiting for the next chair to sit
[50:32] on. Which one? I'll just keep praising
[50:33] God till he wants till he wants me to
[50:35] sit in a chair.
[50:37] Hallelujah. So like last summer, again,
[50:39] I'm using last summer, we went to Iowa
[50:41] and I preached there at both nights on
[50:44] porn, right? And grown men come up and
[50:46] told me I preached their entire life.
[50:48] What's that? Discernment.
[50:50] It judged their life.
[50:54] I And not just some of their life, their
[50:56] whole life.
[50:58] So what did God said, "Hey, Jesse, come
[51:00] down. in this gift, this chair of
[51:02] discernment. I'm like, "All right, glory
[51:03] to God." Malcolm probably sitting right
[51:05] next to
[51:06] me. Right. Okay. Now, okay. All right.
[51:08] Praise God. That was done. Glory to
[51:11] God. Right. And then we had the church
[51:13] order situation in our church. And what
[51:15] did God give us? A discernment through
[51:17] brother Dennis McBride for and maybe
[51:19] even prophetic foretold everything that
[51:21] would happen. That's right. Amen.
[51:24] So, it's like God called brother Dennis
[51:26] to come to the pulpit of prophecy. I'll
[51:28] say it like that. the furniture piece of
[51:32] prophecy.
[51:35] But when he come last time, he didn't
[51:36] preach on prophecy, right? Uh as far as
[51:38] wasn't prophetic, it was uh focus and
[51:41] satisfaction. And how many were blessed?
[51:44] Absolutely. How many how many would say
[51:45] how many would say you needed focus? My
[51:47] hands up. So that discerned my life,
[51:49] right? How many needed satisfaction? Me.
[51:53] That that discerned my life. That judged
[51:55] my life. Well, that's what the word is
[51:57] supposed to. The word is a discerner of
[51:59] the thoughts intents of the heart.
[52:04] Okay? So, it's important for you and I
[52:07] to know that we can be used of any of
[52:09] these at any
[52:11] time. All right? And I still have the
[52:13] date when sister Naomi spoke in tongues
[52:15] when I preached this back in 2017 in the
[52:18] other church, the other sanctuary over
[52:20] there. She spoke in an unknown tongue
[52:21] right after I preached on this on gifts
[52:23] of the Holy Spirit. Okay? And that was
[52:26] for her because remember her testimony
[52:28] when we did the podcast, her testimony
[52:30] was she prayed one day, "Lord, just let
[52:32] me speak in tonesues to know that I got
[52:33] the Holy Ghost." And she totally forgot
[52:35] about it. Didn't even think about it.
[52:37] Even after she spoke in tongues, she
[52:39] didn't remember till she talked to her
[52:40] dad on the
[52:42] phone. In other words, church, God's not
[52:45] going to forget your prayers.
[52:47] Hallelujah. Praise God. God hears them.
[52:49] Amen. And that day, brother Mercy, God
[52:52] let Sister Nomi to sit in the chair of
[52:54] tongues.
[52:56] This is a really nice chair. Can I say
[52:58] it's a real edifying chair? Because the
[53:01] Bible says it edifies you. It must be
[53:04] one of those ma massage chairs,
[53:06] right? It really edifies you. Brother
[53:09] Brooks had a massage chair back when we
[53:10] were in Iowa, right? Oh, yeah. You said
[53:12] it. That's really edifying. Really
[53:14] builds you up, right? Really makes you
[53:16] feel
[53:17] good. But has she spoken in tongues
[53:19] since then? I don't know. At least not
[53:21] in the service. At church, that's okay
[53:23] because it's God doing it. Is God the
[53:24] one asking us to sit in the different
[53:26] gifts
[53:28] or enjoy the different gifts of
[53:31] God? Now, if you'll notice, let's apply
[53:33] sensibly. Now, see that you'll under so
[53:35] that you understand that's the way I
[53:36] want to do this is because I realize I'm
[53:38] talking to intelligent men. So, in the
[53:40] scripture 1 Corinthians 12, it was said
[53:42] there's nine spiritual gifts. Well, then
[53:44] tongues was one of those gifts in the
[53:45] body of Christ. Say, let's show it for
[53:46] an illustration and make it simple. I
[53:48] know you catch it, but let's be sure
[53:50] that you get it. This room is the body
[53:51] of Christ. So see when you're saved you
[53:53] come in the room of Christ Christ's body
[53:55] and by one spirit we're baptized in this
[53:57] room and in this room is a gift of a
[54:00] chair to relax. There's a gift of light.
[54:02] Now look light chair. There's a gift of
[54:05] heat control out there, right? There's a
[54:08] gift of a rocker in the nursery. There's
[54:10] a gift of a lounge, a gift of a rug.
[54:12] There's a gift of a picture. See what I
[54:13] mean? There's all these
[54:15] gifts. There's gifts. But how do you get
[54:17] in that body? By one spirit. We're all
[54:19] baptized into one body and then subject
[54:22] to any of the
[54:24] gifts. See, so if speaking in tonesues
[54:27] then is evidence of the Holy Ghost, all
[54:28] these other things has to be evidence of
[54:29] the Holy Ghost, too. What a good
[54:30] argument that is, right? Because all
[54:33] tongues is just one of the nine
[54:35] furniture pieces in the
[54:37] room. If that's evidence, well, then all
[54:39] of them got to be evidences. Well, of
[54:41] course, we know a gift is not evidence
[54:42] of being born again, right?
[54:46] You have to do all these other things,
[54:48] these others, prophesy, interpret, have
[54:50] wisdom and knowledge. But then Paul goes
[54:52] on to fix that and says, "Do all speak
[54:54] with tongues?" No. Do all the gift of
[54:55] interpretation? But God has set in the
[54:57] church severally. See, he just fixed it
[55:00] up like
[55:02] that. Now, if you believers, how many
[55:05] believers is here? I could I could not
[55:07] do it. I cannot bring him. It takes all
[55:09] of us together to do it. I'm just a part
[55:11] of him, and you're a part of him. But if
[55:12] you're sick and needy, I'm your brother.
[55:14] And God sent the church. Now there's
[55:16] nine spiritual gifts goes in each local
[55:17] body which is tongues, interpretation of
[55:19] tongues, prophecies and so forth. But
[55:21] there's five predestinated offices of
[55:23] the church. Apostles, prophets,
[55:25] teachers, pastors and evangelists.
[55:26] That's what God sent in the church.
[55:28] That's an
[55:30] office. The Holy Spirit might fall on
[55:32] one tonight and speak with tongues and
[55:34] the other give the prophecy and so forth
[55:36] and next night it might be on somebody
[55:38] else and then somebody else like that.
[55:40] That's local gifts in the body to what?
[55:42] keep us
[55:44] straight. Hallelujah. So why did God
[55:46] send brother Dennis to give us that that
[55:49] uh discernment or prophecy to keep us
[55:52] straight on the word of God?
[55:55] Hallelujah.
[55:57] Glory. All right, let's stand to our
[55:59] feet, my guys. Was that an
[56:00] hour? 56 minutes. Glory to God.
[56:03] Musicians can come. I didn't know if it
[56:06] was possible. Hallelujah. But all things
[56:07] are possible. Hallelujah.
[56:09] I just want to get into that because
[56:11] there's so much more I want to uh preach
[56:13] on that, but I just thought for tonight,
[56:14] let's keep it uh simple. We'll start
[56:16] there and then maybe next week we'll
[56:18] look at some of these examples and I
[56:19] want you to think about uh them in your
[56:22] life. Like I even, you know, I thought
[56:23] it was uh timely. Sister Zur, I kept
[56:25] this up here and Zur had a couple
[56:26] healing testimonies, right? So that
[56:29] might be God sitting her in a chair.
[56:31] That might be a chair God uses her more.
[56:33] Or it could be the last time she sits in
[56:35] that chair. Sister Naomi had that gift
[56:38] of faith. Her brother literally she told
[56:41] us she told us there's going to be no
[56:43] the baby was uh
[56:45] breach and she said the doctor's not
[56:48] even going to have to adjust the baby.
[56:50] That's quite a thing to say because last
[56:52] time the doctor did have to
[56:53] adjust
[56:56] Zion. And she said, "I just believe I
[56:59] have faith it's going to happen." And
[57:02] church before we got there, Kristen had
[57:04] already fell. Oh, yeah. Christian had a
[57:06] friend come over and confirmed already
[57:08] the babies has moved and it came to
[57:11] pass. She said, "I just had faith it was
[57:12] going to happen." Hallelujah. My church,
[57:16] what does that tell me? God's among
[57:18] us. And that keeps us straight.
[57:21] Right? Now, the one I I didn't tell you
[57:23] was my wife was laboring over 24 hours
[57:26] and she's asking, she does she's really
[57:28] tired. You know, labor's super intense.
[57:30] She's really tired and she asks the
[57:32] 80-year-old midwife, "This woman is a
[57:35] holiness woman. Did you girls see her?
[57:37] She got this long dress on. She got this
[57:40] white hair tied up in Ramsa like a onion
[57:44] peel, right? She just she's so humble
[57:48] and she doesn't have high heels
[57:51] on praying, you know, talking about God.
[57:55] And my wife Kristen asked her, you know,
[57:56] well, should I go to the hospital or
[57:58] not? you know, I don't want to go too
[57:59] far with interventions. And she just
[58:02] kind of waited there for a moment and
[58:03] she said, "I think you better go because
[58:06] you've tried everything
[58:07] here. And if you go, go soon. Go now
[58:11] because you've already labored 24 hours.
[58:13] You don't want to stay here and get all
[58:15] worn out and then have to make a quick
[58:18] decision that might harm you. Go while
[58:20] you have good energy." And then just do
[58:22] one. And I'm kind of paraphrasing. My
[58:23] wife can correct me, honey, if I'm if
[58:25] I'm wrong on I'm going to be wrong on at
[58:27] least one detail in here, okay? So, just
[58:29] bear with me. But the point was she
[58:32] said, "Go now." Now, church, it's a good
[58:34] thing she
[58:35] did, right? Because she had that uh that
[58:38] that ring happen and the baby was not
[58:41] going to be born at home. There's no
[58:43] way. And what if the heartbeat of the
[58:45] baby had dropped at home and she just
[58:47] decided to stay
[58:49] home? You could have lost the baby.
[58:52] lost mom. What did she do? She gave us a
[58:55] word. Wisdom is not just what to do.
[58:57] It's when to do it. She said, "Go now."
[59:00] The church glad we
[59:02] went. Now, how do you judge wisdom? You
[59:04] look at the fruit of it. Look at the
[59:05] fruit of it. We got a fruit of the
[59:07] womb. Got a healthy baby, healthy mom.
[59:09] And the church said, "I didn't know what
[59:12] to do, Caris." Okay. I didn't know what
[59:14] to do. But something by the Holy Spirit,
[59:17] God spoke through that elderly holding
[59:20] his sister wearing the skirt with long
[59:22] hair said, "You need to go now." And
[59:25] Christian just knew something quickened
[59:26] it to my wife. It's time to
[59:28] go. Then we went we we went there and
[59:31] everything just one after another. We
[59:32] tried every little in every intervention
[59:35] and then finally uh the baby's heart
[59:38] rate went down and just within a matter
[59:39] of moments they got her ready for
[59:41] surgery and off we go to the the surgery
[59:43] room.
[59:46] See, wisdom is justified of its
[59:49] children. Well, there it is, children.
[59:50] Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm talking
[59:53] natural children, but really it's
[59:55] spiritual children. Wisdom is known by
[59:57] the results that it
[59:59] bears. And so, that's what I I realize
[1:00:02] now. That was a word of wisdom. Here's
[1:00:04] what you do. Do it now. Hallelujah.
[1:00:07] Thank God for his mercy and grace. Let's
[1:00:08] bow our hearts. How many want a ministry
[1:00:10] to serve the Lord? You got one. You just
[1:00:12] got to realize what it is. And then you
[1:00:14] also have to be flexible enough to know
[1:00:16] it might change the next
[1:00:17] service.
[1:00:19] Hallelujah. And you might have to wait
[1:00:21] weeks and months between different
[1:00:23] operations of the Holy Spirit, but it's
[1:00:25] going to operate. Praise God. It's going
[1:00:27] to operate. Let's bow our
[1:00:30] hearts. Father God, we thank you for
[1:00:32] today, Lord. And thank you for blessing
[1:00:33] this little gathering, Lord. Thank you
[1:00:35] for the people that came to hear your
[1:00:36] word. Bless them, Lord God. I thank you,
[1:00:38] God. As brother Dez told me, be happy
[1:00:40] for the people that keep coming back,
[1:00:42] Lord. Thank you for the saints who keep
[1:00:43] coming back, Lord God. We're so blessed
[1:00:45] to have Christian friends like this,
[1:00:47] dear God. Lord, I trust they were
[1:00:49] blessed. I trust something from this
[1:00:51] holy Bible spoke to them here tonight,
[1:00:52] Lord God. Thank you, Lord, that every
[1:00:55] person have a min has a ministry. The
[1:00:58] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:01:00] every member of Bride of Christ
[1:01:01] Fellowship to profit with
[1:01:03] all. We thank you for this testimonies
[1:01:06] here from Sister Zur and Sister Naomi's
[1:01:08] testimony, Lord. And this testimony
[1:01:11] of this wonderful midwife, Lord God.
[1:01:13] Karen's her name. Yes,
[1:01:15] Karen. Lord, for that word and it's in
[1:01:18] season. It was so needed in that season.
[1:01:21] Kristen needed direction. Lord, you let
[1:01:23] her speak
[1:01:24] that. And I believe, Lord, it's
[1:01:26] possible. Could have saved one life or
[1:01:28] even
[1:01:29] two. So Lord, what can we say but thank
[1:01:32] you, Lord God. What can we say but
[1:01:33] praise be to Almighty
[1:01:36] God. And Lord, you said the spirit of
[1:01:40] God bears witness with our spirit that
[1:01:43] we are the sons and daughters of God.
[1:01:45] And Lord, that spirit speaking through
[1:01:48] Karen, it was confirmed in my wife's
[1:01:51] heart. Lord, I believe that Lord God,
[1:01:54] wisdom is justified of her children and
[1:01:56] you gave us a child through it, Lord
[1:01:57] God. Thank you, God. You're so merciful,
[1:02:00] Lord Jesus.
[1:02:02] I give you praise. I give you worship,
[1:02:04] Lord
[1:02:05] God. I love you, Lord God. When we don't
[1:02:09] know what to do, I was praying that
[1:02:10] whole time, Lord, off and on. I was on
[1:02:12] my knees saying, "God, what's wrong?
[1:02:13] God, what's wrong? Have I sinned against
[1:02:15] you, Lord? Is anything wrong? God,
[1:02:16] what's wrong? Why isn't the baby come?"
[1:02:19] Then, Lord, you speak that through
[1:02:23] character. And Lord, the results bore
[1:02:25] witness that it was your spirit. Lord
[1:02:27] God, I was praying for guidance. I was
[1:02:30] praying for the right thing to do.
[1:02:31] Praying what's going to happen and you
[1:02:33] just worked everything out. You gave my
[1:02:35] wife
[1:02:37] peace and you blessed those doctors to
[1:02:39] give us a healthy mother, healthy wife
[1:02:43] and this beautiful little baby we get to
[1:02:45] hold. Lord God, thank you
[1:02:47] Jesus. Father God, I don't take these
[1:02:49] things lightly. I want to come back to
[1:02:51] the house of God and give you praise
[1:02:54] Lord. Lord, you saw the hands up, Lord.
[1:02:57] Everyone has a ministry. Lord, help them
[1:02:59] to be faithful to it. Lord, help me to
[1:03:02] be
[1:03:06] faithful. And Lord, help us to be able
[1:03:09] to sit down in the chairs or the gifts
[1:03:12] that you have in those moments when you
[1:03:15] want to use us,
[1:03:16] Lord. Lord, thank you that we're in this
[1:03:19] room, this body of Christ. Oh, Lord,
[1:03:21] it's the greatest room I can be in, Lord
[1:03:23] God. Hallelujah.
[1:03:28] I don't want to be in the body of the
[1:03:30] book of the uh idol worshippers at
[1:03:32] Madison Square Garden or Fenway Park or
[1:03:36] the local town tavern. I don't want to
[1:03:38] be in those bodies. I want to be in the
[1:03:40] body of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah. Thank you, God. Use me, Lord
[1:03:45] God. Use your people, Lord
[1:03:51] Jesus. Help us, Lord God, to be praying
[1:03:53] for these gifts. So, we want to pray for
[1:03:56] that now. Lord, with my Bible open,
[1:03:57] Lord, I've opened my eyes now, but Lord,
[1:03:59] I pray for wisdom in Jesus Christ's
[1:04:01] name. I pray for knowledge in Jesus
[1:04:04] Christ's
[1:04:05] name. I pray for the gift of faith in
[1:04:08] Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. I pray
[1:04:11] for gifts of healing in the name of the
[1:04:14] Lord Jesus
[1:04:15] Christ. I pray for the working of
[1:04:18] miracles in the name of Jesus Christ, my
[1:04:20] Lord. I pray for prophecy, likely
[1:04:24] dreams, however you would want to do it,
[1:04:27] Lord, in the name of Jesus
[1:04:29] Christ. I pray for discernment of
[1:04:32] spirits in Jesus Christ's name, Lord,
[1:04:34] for the glory of God, that you might be
[1:04:36] magnified, that the church might be kept
[1:04:38] clean, kept in order, Lord, as your
[1:04:41] prophet taught. And I pray for tongues
[1:04:43] in Jesus Christ's name. And I pray for
[1:04:46] interpretation of tongues in Jesus
[1:04:48] Christ's name. You told us though to
[1:04:50] covet mostly prophecy. So Lord give us
[1:04:52] prophecies. Foretell us the future.
[1:04:54] Foretell us secrets God that we can
[1:04:56] stand back and say God knows all things.
[1:04:59] God knows my heart. God knows my life.
[1:05:02] And if he knows my future, surely he
[1:05:04] knew my past. Surely he forgave my past.
[1:05:07] Hallelujah. Surely my future's with him.
[1:05:10] Lord God. Oh Lord, I can see now why
[1:05:13] prophecy is so
[1:05:14] important. It shows the mind of Christ.
[1:05:17] Hallelujah.
[1:05:19] For the spirit of prophecy is the spirit
[1:05:21] of Jesus Christ, our
[1:05:25] Lord. Lord, I thank you for tonight,
[1:05:27] Lord. Thank you for these promises.
[1:05:29] Thank you for the communion that I can
[1:05:30] have with you, that the saints can have
[1:05:32] with you tonight, Lord. Let us examine
[1:05:34] ourselves. Make sure we're in the faith,
[1:05:36] Lord
[1:05:37] God. Lord, it's a communion night. We'd
[1:05:39] say in a spiritual sense, Lord, we love
[1:05:41] you. We love your word, Lord God. We
[1:05:43] love to feast on your word, God.
[1:05:47] Make it real to us, Lord God. More real
[1:05:49] than ever before. I ask
[1:05:52] it. And I believe that God, you're so
[1:05:54] great. You can show the littlest one,
[1:05:56] even Zion, the littlest one here
[1:05:58] tonight. You can show him what gifts he
[1:06:00] has in his life. Lord God, I believe
[1:06:02] you're that great. Lord, I might be the
[1:06:05] oldest here. I'm 44.
[1:06:07] So Lord, from the youngest to the
[1:06:09] oldest, I believe you can show all of us
[1:06:11] our gifts, our
[1:06:15] ministries. You can ask us to sit down
[1:06:17] in this gift and then take a little
[1:06:20] break and then use us in that gift. Lord
[1:06:23] God, all things are
[1:06:25] possible. Lord, we just want to be used
[1:06:28] for your
[1:06:30] glory. I ask all these blessings in
[1:06:32] Jesus Christ's name. Say
