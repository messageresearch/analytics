waiting for Jesus his second coming praise the Lord let's go to Revelation chapter 3 I like to look at the Laodicean Church age this will be part 6 of the Laodicean Church age the last time I preached it was November 2015 so it's been a while went back and checked my notes and did my studies so Revelation chapter 3 we're looking at types of the Laodicean Church age this morning it's a thought I've never really had before I was driving the car with my family and the thought just struck me did you ever something along the lines of you need to study the types of the layers see in church age and so I did that there's 22 hits on that and we did that by God's grace so let's go to Revelation chapter 3 so thankful for God and God's grace good to see all the Saints this morning that could make it out to the house of Lord sister trying to make sure you tell the Saints we said hello hello and give our greetings to them as without by the grace the Lord revelation 3 let's go to verse 14 now before I read us remember Jesus gives no compliment to this church age this is kind of a rough church age but that's the hour that we're living in amen we've got to overcome all the temptations of the world we've got to live for Jesus Christ in this hour amen we're grateful to do it happy about it and we've got to do exactly what Jesus said in this hour so this is what Christ tells us to do in verse 14 these are red-letter words the words of Jesus Christ and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the create I'm sorry the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth most people don't know that Jesus talks about throwing up churches out of his mouth most people don't know that but that's in the Bible if a church will not speak the words of the Bible Jesus will not let them be his mouthpiece they'll not be part of the body of Christ verse 17 because they'll say US this is the attitude of the false churches because they say I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire the Jesus is telling them how oh I'll give you advice I'll counsel you if you'll come to me I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may s be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten if Jesus loves you he's gonna tell you where you're wrong in order to correct to you how many boo that these zealous therefore and repent that's what we find so rare in this hour people that are eager to repent because it's a prideful age let's be those that are eager to repent praise God verse twenty behold I stand at the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith of the churches let's bow our heads for word of Prayer they need on your heart just make it known unto God Heavenly Father we love you Lord today we give you praise honor thank you for the songs that we can sing we think about meeting you in the rapture morning dear God we're thinking of that now Lord we're watching and waiting Lord Jesus we worship your Majesty Lord God Oh hallelujah we want to hold your hand this morning I want to meet you in prayer right now Lord we know we are dear God we ask Heavenly Father you speak to us through this word Lord that you've given to us father may the Holy Spirit have preeminence make invicta ii heart that needs the repent may hearts that need to repent may they be zealous to repent eager to repent that they would be overcomers to sit with you on the throne dear God have your way this morning bless your people for coming out Lord we appreciate the sacrifices the many mouths have been driven Lord God and nor the time that's been taken to sacrifice may you bless them according to their their labors Lord God and we will give you all the praise and glory and honor and Jesus Christ Nate never said Amen god bless she's being seated praise the Lord this is part six of the latest in church age Malachi can switch over when you're learning okay thank you buddy he's on it thank you sir praise God mmm-hmm praise God no I think we'll just pick up right where we left off here I you say I haven't preached on this since November 22nd 2015 so I just felt a bird like I said I'm driving in the van and something just spoke to me and it said study the types of Laodicea I've never I never thought that in my life so I just wanted to see what the prophet of God said about Laodicea and it's types throughout the Bible and I found eight of them by the grace of Lord so we'll try to get through those today and show those to you by the grace of God there is an John and John and I were talking on this recently there is total application for everything we're preaching in other words everything we preach can be applied directly to your life and I'll just try to show that today by the grace of the Lord all these eight examples can be proved can be applied to your life and we just have to say is how does my life compared to Lots life or how does my life compared to Judas's or how does my life compared to Enochs hallelujah and if you do that if you apply every one of those then that's making the most of our time together and it's through the foolishness of preaching to save them that would believe Amen there's no greater power to change your life and through the preaching of the word how many know that's true there's no greater power it's to unite us as we saw last Sunday so unite us edify us and bring us in this full stature of the measure of Christ through the preaching of the word but and the prophet of God said if you want to get pepped up there's no other way to get pepped up if the preaching doesn't pep you up nothing will hey man let's get packed up this morning amen by the preaching of the word so we're in the Laodicean Church age it started in 1906 and we're not sure when it's gonna end we have no idea but we'll know the season Amen will feel the coming of the Lord because the bride makes herself ready as she approaches the going-away time as she approaches the wedding time she can feel it and she gets ready how many women been married in here what do you do you feel the pressure as you come up to your wedding day but isn't there - hopefully there's a time that comes when you can feel I'm ready maybe not for everybody but there should be there should be a feeling we made all the preparations we're ready for the wedding amen and I believe that's what the bride of Jesus Christ is experiencing now they're feeling the Holy Spirit help them get ready every day of their lives they've got on Sunday we feel it thank God we filled on Wednesday but I'm so more thankful I feel a-- on monday through sunday every day we should feel it being made ready every single day the messenger was Elijah because he was to restore the faith back to the father's according to Malachi 4 5 and 6 and of course we know that's William Branham he died in 1965 but had 56 years to leave a testimony for the name of Jesus Christ upon this earth and he did a fabulous job just as Eleazar did a perfect job to get a bride for Isaac so did our Eliezer Haman do the right job to get one for Jesus a bride for Jesus that's right now I just kind of changed my text here because I'm gonna add some visitors and maybe they never read revelation three so I changed my text you know just when we saw it we had visitors so they could see we wanted everybody to see what Jesus was saying to this church age it's not a very nice message because remember there's no compliments for Laodicea there's none and so we know that overall as a whole and that's because there's a very small group of faithful Christians in Laodicea this is the age when very few people will be saved most people would just be deceived by preachers the Bible says that deceivers will wax worse and worse most people have a preacher who deceives them into living in sin but there will be a small group who have the preachers of the Holy Spirit giving them inspiration to clean their lives to make them ready to get their lamps trimmed and get their fires burning for the coming of the Lord amen and they'll go out to meet Christ in the wedding procession amen they won't be saying oh I need a prayer life or I should have prayed more that's what the foolish virgin will be saying but the true Bride of Christ will have a prayer life should the fire of Christ their life everything will be made ready for the rapture amen hallelujah so I'm just gonna briefly review parts one through five and I do mean briefly I'm gonna try to go quickly here because I don't think any of us even I couldn't remember what I preached on the lay OC in church age so if I couldn't remember I don't know I didn't know how many of us could remember so we went over this a little bit but the world'll and the word Laodicea means justice of the people the literal city was a major financial and political power earthquakes destroyed the city the city perfectly types our church age with its riches and political pressures this age will also end with earthquakes as well the Bible clearly says that in the book of Revelation metha at the sounding of the trumpets when the earthquakes and the woes there's all these earthquakes at the end of the world and we know that's coming now our first verse we looked at and unto the Angel of the Church aleris ian's these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God don't you love how Jesus describes himself you and I could try to describe Jesus but it's best when we let Jesus describe himself amen because when he describes himself we get the capstone revelation of is this three-fold capstone revelation this is the last Church age this is the last time Jesus is going to describe himself to his Gentile bride before he marries her and he tells his wife I'm the Amen I'm the Soviet I'm the faithful and true witness in other words you can trust me bride I'm faithful amen I'm a true witness of the things of God and I am the beginning of the creation of God and in other words Jesus saying you're part of the new creation of God amen when you're born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are part of the new creation Jesus was the firstborn among many brethren and we are the next born among many brethren I'll say like this we're the last born among many brethren right until the 144,000 but were the last in the Gentile church age how many can say amen to that now remember Jesus says I know your works you're neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot Jesus would rather have you cold or hot than be lukewarm kind of wishy-washy in the middle of the road so Jesus gives no compliment to this age it's such a short age it's such a deceived age he cannot give a compliment to the age because the group of believers is so small yet God sees our works as our faith expressed it is better to be cold than lukewarm it's best to be hot amen how many want to be hot for Christ we must be hot for Christ that's the only hope of going in the rapture is to give everything to the Lord Jesus Christ I hope if any of the sermons I preached in the last few years have helped you I hope it's helped you in this way to help you decide I've got to cut everything out that doesn't glorify Christ and I want to serve Christ with a hot daily experience giving everything sacrificing everything for my Lord amen I hope that I hope your tent is clean this morning amen because if your tents clean this church will be clean hallelujah it's exactly right I said lukewarm now remember there's three conditions the word lukewarm means tepid lacking conviction when you come to church and read your Bible or you're listening to preach sermons you don't feel any conviction from those sermons that's a lukewarm experience that's what lukewarm means there's no fire there's you don't have you don't have a feeling for Jesus you come to church and you don't feel I mean you feel a little bit but not you don't feel real conviction we need to feel God's speaking to our hearts every service we need to feel God speaking to our hearts everyday amen and that the only way that's possible is through dying to ourselves and accepting the Word of God and saying God make it new again I want to fall another few again Jesus amen help me to fall in love with you and not the things of the world amen now remember a hot program tells us the hot experience is to know the truth and live it a cold chilly experience doesn't even care about God it's cold toward God doesn't care what the word says but yet those people can go to church as well right like Pharisees and so for like that they were twofold the children of hell than the people that witness to them or in proselyte of them to the Pharisee religion so they can even be Church members and be cold so what it boils down to is we must feel the conviction of the holy spirit we must have enthusiasm for God we must not neglect the things of God and we must live what we know hallelujah I notice he's gonna throw up Jesus is gonna vomit the false churches out of his mouth which means they will no longer be the mouthpiece of God most churches today are not speaking the Word of God they're preaching about all your best life can be now what an awful thing that is if you're if your best life is right now how awful you're not gonna enjoy heaven at all because you won't be there amen Church my best life is going to be in the New Jerusalem praise God and the Millennium that's where that my best life is going to be I want to live my best for Christ now yes but see our focus must be on on sacrificial love right now sacrificing for others and not caring about the external things but caring about the inward work that Christ is doing in our lives not so much dressing out the outside but having this the inside man dressed up for God's glory amen most churches are no longer mouthpieces of God how do you know when they let people sin and they keep letting them sin and don't preach against it and they don't rebuke sin they're no longer speaking for God because Jesus says you must be zealous and repent of your sins so any churches that allow people to get married two three times they're not the mouthpieces of God churches that are not homosexuality or transgender they're not the Churches of God they can say that they can call themselves churches but if they don't preach the Word of God and if they don't help the people to live according to Jesus he has thrown them up out of his mouth he has vomited them out because they won't say what he said we must say what Jesus is saying amen see the bride that's Jesus's wife the true church is the mouthpiece through the spirit they both say come to the word come to Christ come to the Word of God have your life changed by the revealed Word of God hey man I said yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her amen how many believe the voice of God's in you I believe it I believe it's the voice of God is in me how do you know because people say God speaks to them when I preach or when I talk to them God speaks them how do you know because of the witnesses that God has given us when we stop saying our words but start saying his words now we become the mouthpiece of God amen the Bible said the spirit and the bride say come once more the world were here direct from God as at Pentecost but of course the word bride will be disowned as in the first church age so will be a smaller more rejected church all the time more rejection more rejection all the time now I'm still in part this part one still or this part one and two I think the Prophet described the church ages of the Lansing church age he said Chile services will drive the true believer to the red-hot services Amen hallelujah glory a true child of God cannot hang around cold dead churches they got to go someplace where there's life they men marry services show enthusiasm once in a while will be the Laodicean Church age where they only get excited about music instead of the word the word should make you most excited the music should refresh you so that when the word comes you can shout hallelujah event you can say hot leg you Jesus I'm gonna live that word amen the latest in church has no warmth of the Holy Ghost they have no burden for lost souls I'm happy to say where there's people crying for lost souls at the altar this morning before service how do you know because I saw it later to see lives are loaded down with worldly events causing lukewarmness they're so weighed down and by heavy burdens of the world they don't feel free when they come to church don't feel happy when they come to church their lives are so heavily burdened with cares of the world they can't even be free and rejoice and love the Lord they're so cold on God uh-huh Jesus said because you say you're rich increased with Goods and have need of nothing notice now not without wretched miserable poor blind and naked the profits of the church to most people's a business everyone has to be complains or there or I'm sorry paid or they complain most churches not ours most churches people can they're more concerned about the size of the crowd and the preaching of the word that's why we just had a few people here at the start of service it don't bother me because I know Jesus is here I'm not concerned about the number my concern yes to get people here to be safe yes I'm concerned about that but the overall number doesn't move us because all that the father has given me will come to me praise God the people are more concerned about the physical condition of the church than the move of the Holy Ghost you know last night our family came and we did some cleaning here at the church but you know what's more important was the praying we did before service today that's more important we want to we want to clean shirts we want everything organized and neat and clean and swept and everything like that but we want our mind swept out by the Holy Ghost we want our hearts and our desires and our motives and object is to be cleaned out by Jesus Christ amen but mem said people are in a layer to see in church are afraid to say Amen during the service and don't like it when people act drunk in the spirit they don't but I like that amen we like that praise God we like people to be happy about Jesus worshipping Jesus free in the spirit we want to see people move by the Holy Spirit amen and they're afraid people later seen churches are afraid of the manifestations of the gifts in their lives well I can now never want to speak in tongues right I never want to shout or I never want to pray for somebody or I I never want to prophesy because of what other people will think of me the real Christian all they care about is what God thinks about them but that's what Laodicean church is all we could we can never act like that I could never clap my hands I could never get excited you ought to that's why your hands were made to clap and glorify Jesus that's why they were made part three all right I've already done through two of them he said I counsel you to be buying me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see I had a striking dream last night remind me not to forget I had a dream of our brother Brandon last night I've never had a dream about brother Branham till last night and I was in the prayer line I'm gonna tell you about that later so I don't forget it's striking I just remembered I forgot to tell my wife even I just I forgot til I was here at the altar praying and I believe it's uh it's godly wisdom for me going forward it was like I was in the prayer line and brother Graham discern my heart it was striking I've never had a dream like that in my life now the great burdens of this age are pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions that's what we must overcome the pressure to be rich soft living we must not make our lives too easy we've got up you know to pay insurance we got to these things but we can't make them too easy that we neglect the spiritual needs in our lives like if Jesus would call us to you know sacrifice to sell this for the sake of the church and we won't do it something's wrong with our lives if God's calling us overseas and we won't go overseas something's wrong with us right I don't feel that call yet but I feel like coming back amen nervous tensions we must not let ourselves get overcome by nervousness we must have peace that passes understanding amen remember there's Philippians 4 there's eight channels of thought things that are pure lovely holy godly good report there's eight different channels and choose any of those eight and think on those things don't think nervous you are think about how good god is amen think about the last trial you went through if God brought me through that one he's gonna bring me through this one amen he's faithful we must think on the right things and not be nervous don't let nervousness steal your joy or your victory remember gold the gold of God which is the christ-like character which we're gonna get to character then this sermon hopefully because my man said the rich young ruler had character and Jesus loved his character gold must character must be bought from Jesus alone you must go to Jesus and say Jesus I want to buy your character and it only comes through accepting the sufferings that he gives you that's the only way Jesus learned obedience through all the victories and miracles that he did does that sound right that gets the scripture no Jesus learned obedience through the things he suffered you and I will learn obedience through the things that we suffer that's the only way to get gold it's tried in the fire gold godly character is molded in the fires of affliction memorize am 55 said you can buy wine and milk from God without money with a price aren't you glad all of God's eternal blessings don't cost you one cent hey amen God asked you for 10 or 11 percent you know to help the church hopefully more if you can give more that helps the people of God helps the Ministry of God do things like video ministry and all these things that are blessing people around the world but outside of that if you want more character God doesn't ask you for anything he asks you for a spiritual transaction he asks you to sacrifice cares of the world and desires of the world he asked you to sacrifice that and by the sufferings and allow everything I'm sorry to allow everything in your life to mold you into a real Christian amen to accept sufferings knowing that if I suffer it'll teach me how to reign with Christ amen the Bible said we cannot rule and reign with Christ unless we suffer with him amen hallelujah she must be willing to suffer the sufferings of life in order to reign with Jesus this course is different for everybody remember the rich kind of gold is christ-like character tried to the fiery affliction of a furnace I'm sorry the fiery furnace of affliction Jesus character went through Gethsemane Calvary and death and we must go through a daily death dying out to ourselves let me just um let me just go back there let me just share that dream now so I don't forget okay I never my wife can tell you I never have spiritual dreams rarely I thought like two or three most of them are because I have dreams because I'm so worn out and stressed and that affects you know my dreams and I get all nervous and I'm running from things I'm trying to make sure things don't crash you know I think it's the type of my life I'm trying to make sure I balance everything in my life don't don't crash the church and don't crash my job and don't crash my family but I had a dream last night Church I had a dream last night and I was in the prayer line in brother Brown when he was a little younger man he wasn't as old as he was at 65 and I come up with the prayer line and I said brother branham I said something along these lines as a brother branham I went to church why isn't the church moving you know why isn't the church moving like I like to you know could just help me and brother branham looked at me and he said you need to seek God more and honestly my dream I left I left the prayer line thing I come to church every Saturday I fast and pray every Saturday and Sunday I tried to see God I try to pray every morning and every night and I was a little bit upset thinking I fast and pray I try to sacrifice I try to seek God ask my wife I try to pray study as much as I possibly can I have twenty eight thousand words I've written on the book I'm almost done with chapter six I just tried to give all my devotion to Christ and I go in the prayer line now I don't know if this is your I don't know I'm not saying as I say the Lord but it's interesting I've never had a dream before about brother Branham and I come in the prayer line and I leave a little bit confused like I thought I was seeking God so it encouraged me to let me know that there's more of God I can seek it encouraged me that way I don't know what that would do to you but it showed me there must be more I must see God because remember Jeremiah said when you see God with all your heart all your soul all your strength I'll be found of you now how many of us can honestly say every day you see God with all your heart all your mind all your strength in your home on your job on your lunch break how many of us can say we really seek God with all that we have it encouraged me because let me know I need to see God more I need to pray more I need to devote more of my life to Christ sorry I have made me happy and I forgot about that till I was here praying the only time I've ever had a dream about brother branham he said you need to see God more now if the pastor is to see God more then God will help the church to see God more too because the God raises it past their congregation pastor congregation and God knows I've never given more of my time for Christ than right now I'm a deacon treasurer son leader trustee pastor you name it whatever it is I am I'm oh that I felt like I've never given more but there must be room for more to be given day man if Jesus could sanctify himself before his crucifixion and more consecrate his life to God how much more you and I a man so be encouraged I didn't ever knew this before but I was in the prayer line with brother Branham I never knew that that's really nice to have Amen if it wasn't just a dream praise the Lord I'm very thankful for that dream I can't flee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou may'st be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayst see so a prophet describes this all things are naked before the Word of God God sees everything every motive every objective God saw why you came to church today amen God knows why you're here are you here just so people don't think your back slid are you here because you feel bad you don't want to go to hell are you here because you love Jesus Christ I hope it's the third one you're here because you love Jesus Christ because Christ is makes everything known and remember your actions manifest what's inside of you right your reaction to this sermon today will show what's inside of you just like every sermon your response to the singing your your attitude towards me your the word that we're preaching your attitude shows what's in your heart already the Word of God makes everything naked the Word of God makes everything plain to see this is where the person stands this is where they're at this is what they're struggling with this is where they're getting victory the Word of God discerns everything amen now the bride is clothed in white garments the righteousness of saints meaning the purity of life and correctness of acting feeling and thinking this is what the white garment represents eternal life she's pure she's a pure life she acts the right way she feels everything the right thing she thinks the right thing and righteousness comes through faith and the washing of the regeneration of the Spirit as he washed you this week I hope you've had times this week where you felt like Jesus washed here he should wash you every day church amen he should wash you every day that's what prayers are through our prayer so powerful it's like a constant bath it's like another bath it's like another shower you get as you pray you feel the presence of God you repent of your sins remember you found that the outline PRA why you praise him you repent you ask and you yield those are the four ingredients remember that the altar of incense had four ingredients in the incense right so prayer has four ingredients when you surly pray you feel you need to repent and then you could ask God anything Amen hallelujah well this is a longer review and I thought you all but it is a good church you enjoy the review okay I heard a few amens hallelujah you will only take your character with you either the softness of the character lists Laodicean people or the christ-like character tried through the fiery furnace of affliction nearly all people today are naked and not aware of it that's why we didn't preach it on clothes that you wear right when men take off their shirts and show off their muscles or when women wear those tight pants they're showing off their legs they're basically naked men do it - they wear short shorts like that its nakedness women shows off her cleavage she's putting nakedness before men is that right that's exactly right anytime a woman shows down from her shoulders down here it's naked anytime a man shows from his knees up or a woman shows her knees up any area from here to here is naked praise God its nakedness and you must cover and Jesus said you're naked he said come to me and get some clothes amen now you come to me and I'll give you some clothes if you don't have any clothes that covers your thighs I'll give you some clothes I'll buy you some but Jesus wants you to be closed naturally and he wants you to be closed spiritually amen spiritually where your acts are righteous your attitude is righteous amen your works are holy and the price to pay for these garments is you must separate from sin and sinners hallelujah you must be although there must there's got to be times if you're a Christian where you feel all alone but you're never alone because Christ is with you amen but you must feel alone from your family from your friends from your buddies from your friends and your girlfriends and your boyfriend's you must leave all those to serve Jesus Christ hallelujah that's the price to pay for these garments I constantly to buy of me gold tried the fire I thought makes me rich ok I'm into the underlined part and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may see I self allows one to see that hot oil of the Holy Ghost the grease Laodiceans are blind to what God has for them he could only have his word for them but they don't want that they don't want that the only way to know what God has for you is to let him wash your eyes or get a hot oil of your eyes so you can get all the matter out of your eyes so you can see clearly that's the only way to know and then you can read your Bible Church and now the Bible can speak to you now what was striking the reason I knew this was a sermon to preach this morning my daily devotion was Romans 2 and I read Romans 2 this morning he like I read Romans 1 yesterday and I go an open later sea and church age part 5 and I spent most of my time preaching on Romans - what are the chances of that church that was November 22nd of 2015 it's almost like the whole and I had a dream last night of brother Branham and all these latency in church age you know the world doesn't want to seek after God we must put more into seeking God we want to seek more of the word we must seek more of the message we must seek for more of Jesus amen because too many people are seeking for too many other worldly things soft living riches of the world they're nervous they're trying to break their nerves you know with things of the world there's only at one app that can help for that and that's the Bible app so read the Bible and then pray that's all right that's the only app that's going to help you for that churches today substitute the pot of the Holy Ghost for program and the word for Creed there's just everything's the same all the time there's nothing different that happens out of order nobody ever gets saved really you get saved or really repents and instead of preaching the word they preach traditions of Creed's right they're so blind they don't miss tongues and I hope you're missing spiritual gifts I hope you want to see more gifts in the church that's what I'm saying but man said they don't miss tongue speakers they don't miss prophesying or they don't like preaching they don't miss preaching that shucks you like a piece of corn it shucks you it rips down your hide it tears off your feelings it it takes no thought about how you're feeling Lanta see in churches don't miss that but we should want that we should want God to anoint me or whoever's preaching brother bricks or brother Craig or whoever's preaching to skinned our hides if we're wrong to skin our hides and help us to be pure before God hey man if not you're clearly Laodicean lukewarm and church you should here prank say God do a miracle this morning that right oh I don't miss those people used to cry and speak in tongues and shout and scream I don't miss any of that we shouldn't miss that we don't see it for a while we should miss and say God annoying brother Hosea anoint brother Adam or anoint Malachi annoyed somebody with the Holy Ghost amen and like me is what we should say most praise God anoint me we miss the move of the Holy Spirit anoint me to be your servant hallelujah and then Jesus standing outside trying to come in I'm DISA and he said program so he's trying to bring Pentecost back in he's trying to bring the Holy Ghost drunken experience back into the church amen he's saying can I bring the Holy Ghost in with me I love to bring it in with me motors to say don't even get there we'd rather have our Super Bowl we'd rather have our Olympics we'd rather celebrate that Jesus say well I'm gonna give you eternal life amen I'm gonna give you life and life more abundantly hallelujah amen I'm getting there bear with me as many as I love remember program describes us the focus is Jesus's love not ours necessarily and not what he's going back to predestination now in this statement as many as I love Jesus is showing we are saved based upon his choosing as many as I love we glory in his plan in his love elective love is Christ choosing to love us Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated elect according to the foreknowledge of God remember the Bible says that so this statement goes back to the election of God and then to as many as I love I rebuke to rebuke means to reprove and to expose with correction in mind it does not mean to publish I'm sorry punished sorry he chastens the Prophet says with nail-scarred hands so that hands that are correcting you you can see the nails you can know that the person who's correcting me suffered himself the person who's trying to correct me had to be corrected himself he had to be sanctified himself had to be guided himself had this submit to God's will himself he didn't want to die right he didn't want to go the cross three times he said don't let me go the cross and the father said you need to go to the cross that was the guest 70 conference do I have to go the cross and the Dove said yes you must go to the cross if you love them you must go to the cross amen remember he's the Potter we're the clay I never yet seen a good Potter beat up the clay have you honey no your art classes she didn't college you don't sit there and beat up the blue clay but you use gentle hands is that right I know it don't have to slam down the clay to kind of get to be one piece okay so maybe the first view the first view who touches you know it can be harsh but then when he takes the water of that word amen and begins applying the word to your life he shapes you with nail-scarred hands amen we must be zealous and repent the false church has the wrong zeal there's heels for big buildings and creeds like I said I've been to two denominational oneness churches in the last couple years and the biggest cheers I heard was when they're both building a brand they're both building a brand new church those were the biggest cheers of the services and I saw the one church they ran all the brothers ran around the church during the song service they were shouting and screaming clapping but the loudest cheers where we're getting a new church building what is our loudest cheer for it should be to praise Jesus it should be to thank him for all he's done for us amen not some building that's going to pass away but the fact that we're the building amen the believers are the building of Christ hallelujah I'm the temple of the Holy Ghost you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen that should get the biggest shots in the church amen hallelujah amen they're more zealous for their Creed's oh now homosexuals can preach in our church and the heavens saying they're weeping and crying saying no angels are weeping they rejoice when sinners come to repentance though with the cried to the Prophet said we NAMM an to challenge the churches like John the Baptist the best thing for the Laodicean church was a challenge that's why you should get used to me or any preacher giving you a challenge every service most people some people like challenges some people don't I challenge you to give this up I challenge you to repent I challenge you but the Prophet said this is what John the Baptist did this is what the spirit of Elijah does it challenges you to obey the word now for all the things that the Spirit is crying out against our true this age we need someone to come on the scene as John the Baptist did and challenge the church as never before what did I get last night a challenge to see God more my dream I thought I was seeking God brother Adam I thought I was but apparently there's more that I can give to God and I'm willing to accept that challenge it's a challenge God thought so much of it he came to me in a dream and he never does that rarely do I ever get a dream that spiritual like that got to seek God more hey hey man that's exactly what's coming to our age another John the Baptist has come in thank God he came and he will cry out exactly as did the first forerunner he will know we will know that because of what the next verse says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent and we know who he was brother William Branham this is the same message that John had as he cried out to the religious wilderness of pharisees sadducees and heathens repent there was no other course then there's no other course now there was no other way to get back to God then and there is no other way now it is repent change your mind turn around repent for why will you die there's only one way to be saved repent and change your mind never understand that that's the only way to go to heaven is repent of your sins stop thinking that way and change your life now we're almost there I'm preaching part 6 today it must be a fast message because I've spent a lot of time on the review as many as I love I rebuke and chasten the Prophet described of the we're judged by what our hearts did with the truth every one of us will be judged by what we did with the truth that which we heard that which was placed in our conscience the blind will also be judged because it was their choice to remain blind that's what the Bible says the god of this world blinded their eyes because they love darkness of their God of Laodicea more than light they chose to be blind they chose that and when people loved the world more than they loved Christ they're choosing to be blind and God will judge them because of that because they willingly saw the light but they turned down said I don't want to come to the light I'd rather love sin more never see that the only blind who can be saved or those who are grant eternal life at the white throne judgment because they must have had a glimmer of light hey man they must have had a little moment where they saw the light and they were good to a Christian other than that they're surprised what do you mean I get eternal life what do you mean I didn't do anything worthy of eternal life and Jesus said yes you did you must forgot you and you were good to the Brethren you were good to me goodness they gave clothes now this has to be natural this is not spiritual because a sinner cannot give the white righteousness of Christ to a saint that's why I'm glad all these churches are doing closed drives right food drives I'm grateful for that although they're not gonna get much of a reward I would say like that see they cared about people's clothes who didn't have clothes they gave food to the hungry they visited people in the hospital they visited the brethren of Christ Jesus gives them eternal life that's the only blind people they're gonna be saved the Prophet said hard I'm sorry no the Bible says hard unrepentant hearts store up the wrath of God against themselves for they obey not the truth every time they say no I'm not going to repair every service they come to said I will repent I'm gonna keep my bitterness I'm gonna keep my cares of the world I'm going to keep my lusts of the world all these things they're actually storing up for themselves heaps of wrath we're at the same time when we repent we're throwing up treasures in heaven oh yeah amen Romans 2 states that God has written the law upon every heart and our conscience is witness to this all men are without excuse in the day of judgment the Bible said those who have the law the Jews or will be judged by that law the Bible said those heathens who don't have any law already have the law in their hearts so every heathen every Aboriginal more they'll all be judged by the law that God placed in their hearts that's Hebrews after Romans chapter 2 the one I read this morning that's why I knew it was of God had two or three witnesses Jesus told the woman at the well of her sins including her adulteries Jesus then play around with people's sins John the Baptist told Herod all the evils he had done because that's what a true man of God will do he'll tell you all the evils you've done wrong one more John the Baptist did not want to harm Herod and Herodias by rebuking them he only wanted to save them from the wrath that was to come but men of God are always misunderstood and he paid for this preaching with his life preachers are always misunderstood when they're preaching by the Holy Ghost and it shucks you like a piece of corn and it tears apart all your worldly desires and all these things like that they're misunderstood they're thinking they're picking on me it's the Holy Ghost trying to say put the eye salve on your eyes put the white garments on take some of my gold amen have some gold tried in the fire be clothed with the righteousness of Christ amen they're always misunderstood and that's because the people are blind they love the world more than they love Christ now I can start part six was that a pretty good review I know well I knew nobody would remember all that so I thought it'd be good cuz I didn't remember it how many I only thought that was helpful by God's grace praise the Lord something told me in the car it spoke to my heart and it said types of Laodicea so I only looked up the types of layer to see the first one Jesus's blood is a type four layer to see I preached on this recently the Bible said Eleazar would took the blood of the red heifer for the waters of separation he would sprinkle at seven times glory and the Prophet said see oh if we just had time to linger here at the door a few minutes what those seven stripes of the door met seven ages the seven church a dispensation ever every age since Genesis to the end of Revelation it's been the blood through every age no Creed's no doctrines no nothing but the blood of the Lord Jesus amen so church there's a bread for us today amen it's a type now just so you know I looked up the the fires of the furnace where seven times hotter there's 22 hits on that and not one of them did he mention Laodicea now I know it might be a tight but I just used the ones brother Rams specifically said and I believe in taking Liberty Union you've heard me take Liberty I said I believe this is my revelation I believe in that but I just wanted this morning I just want to show you the eight that brother Brad have said himself that type out later to see ya number two Enoch and also an Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand and the Saints program said so Enoch the type of the church here he's also typed in the seven churches can you think of that the seven church age how many believers there's been honey breeze there's been seven messengers oh we all believe it if we believe the Bible if you don't believe the Bible of course you don't believe it but there has been and now we're living in the seven church age and when the Bible said that the seven church age when the messenger of the seven church age begins to sound his message the mysteries of all the things that's been twisted up down through the age would be revealed in that time go here we see it the son of man coming among people and doing just exactly confirming his message as he said he would here we find in this last age now that was Enoch the seventh which was translated and Noah being a type of the remnant of the Jews is to be carried over hallelujah and Church huh me know what sacrificed in Enoch have to make it in the rapture blood sacrifice the same sacrifice Abraham had the same sacrifice Noah had they all had the same sacrifice but somebody had a calling for the rapture the difference was Enoch had a predestinated call he had a predestinated invitation to go to the rapture and his sacrifice was sufficient to take him in the rapture a man and so is our sacrifice the bread of Jesus Christ sufficient to take you and I in the rapture Amen hallelujah amen thank you Jesus a common farmer a common nobody he just said I'm gonna walk with Jesus Christ all the days of my life and pretty soon he started taking a heavenly March pretty soon he started going higher in heavenly places and brother Aaron said the father looked over and said can I take a walk with you today I'd like you to take your home today and brother Ram said Enoch said can I say goodbye to my wife and children first he was willing to leave behind everybody so he could take a heavenly rock and church we got to be like that too willing to leave behind any sin any person that won't separate themselves and take the white robes we've got to walk away from them put on the white robes and walk up with Jesus Laurie thank you lord ah the third one Israel's three stages to the promised land by the RAM did you know this I didn't know this I forgot this Ram said the taking the promised land was the third stage after coming out of Egypt and brother Ram typed those three stages to the last three Church ages Luther Wesley Elijah Branham now have the scripture here where they came through the wilderness and I give it and they go into a land that flows with milk and honey the Prophet said everything in the Old Testament type the new now as Israel made our journey going to the promised land had three stage the journey coming out of Egypt Cadis Bernina the judgment crossing in the promised land and that's just exactly the three churches after the dark age of three churches then the next come to Philadelphia then the next layer to see us then she crosses over beautiful oh how that God in the old days when the pillar flower was hanging over the top a camp of Israel they watch that how many when we preached on Joshua last summer and I showed you by the grace of God the seven enemies you got a fight when you're in the land once we get victory over those seven enemies guess what then we have peace then we have millennium honey I Amen where we got to get victory over those seven nations hallelujah after we get in the promised land and God will do it by His amazing grace hallelujah Oh glory the days of Ahab Jezebel denied you were type he have saw Elijah said art he that troubleth Israel he said no sir I'm not troubled Israel but now that father's house because you've forsaken the commandments of the Lord to see they had Elijah that was rebuking the leaders for their day so have we had Elijah that's rebuked the governments of this day now this Jehoshaphat feeling kind of good because he was a great king of Israel said come visit me went down there they took an ox and sheep and done sacrifice all the time in a Habs heart down there he was a deceiver because he was not worshiping that or offering those sheep and things with a true heart because after all he leaned more on his wife's religion hey man I'll preponderating arms of Christ religion we must lead upon the blood of Jesus Christ not upon the churches and famous churches and denominations and mega churches we're not leaning on that we're leaning on the bloody bleeding word of the message of the hour amen hallelujah that's what we're leaning on today see a have liens on his previous church worldly idolatrous Jezebel religion or don't lean upon your denominations thoughts lean upon this thus saith the Lord message God has given to us amen that's what I'm leaning upon hallelujah and notice just as they have married just about during the time that great Dark Age visionary brought idolatry into Israel a very type of today see a type just in the Dark Age where we come out through the early apostles second round third round over to the Dark Age the fifteen hundred years just as a have married Jezebel idolatry in Israel so did the Holy Ghost Church marrying two isms and brought idolatry back and we must be careful we don't worship William Branham we must be careful we don't worship pastors in the message or evangelist and exalt them and think they're so holy remember that's the seed of Nicoli anism to separate the preachers from the people but see the thing is you've got to participate in worship amen if I was out with the anointing on me I've got to participate in worship and if you want the anointing on you you've got to be a participant in the service amen now just sit back and do nothing but when you've got the Holy Ghost on you you have a part in the service amen you are participating you're enjoying it you're feeling convicted you're rejoicing in it you're getting strength from it why because you're filled with the Holy Ghost amen you participate in what God's doing amen all right thank you Jesus see it's a form of Christianity just very dark and now it's moved on down each day each church age moved downs that same thing to the great climax till the lukewarm condition comes a lukewarm Laodicean Church age it's all moving down what a horrible hour that we're living in November it's the most glorious and the most awful time it's both it's glorious for the believer awful for the unbeliever number five I'm going to eight and I'm almost done now I preach less than an hour today well maybe I'll extend a little bit just to meet my hour John twelve why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor then he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put in the bag see when we need to care what the money spent on right but Judas didn't really care how the money was spent he wanted to have control the money so he could be benefited by the money praise God that's right look a brother who said Oh your identification could you be identified with the group that Judas was in he started to walk with Jesus he started out all right like the Pentecostals did years ago but the very thing they come out of the organization your mothers and fathers this young group has turned right back and made them one just like they come out of see what a type I'm sorry what type of group are you with now the Bible said the lancing Church a Judas you know carried he saw the possibilities are getting something great with what he had he was identified with Jesus so he thought with that he carried the bag he can make some extra money by selling him for thirty pieces of silver you know I can make money off this message I can make a few extra dollars off it and be disloyal to it I won't keep all the message I'll just keep most of it for three and a half years or hover I'll just keep it for a few years but when I can make some money off this message I'll make some money and go against the Word of God the Prophet said that's not somewhat not a little bit that's exactly what the layer of seeing church age did the Bible said so you are rich and increased you say I've increased I've got plenty of goods I have need of nothing and you don't know that you're wretched miserable blind naked and don't know it that's Pentecostal the last church age not Luthor not Wesley but Pentecostals that's the church hey does that help by God's grace all these churches that have been vomited out there on the level of Judas because they're so concerned about money but it's not money for the Gospels sake it's money for their sink like remember that quote I showed brother Graham brother Ram said if I had 100 million dollars what would he do would he build a church he said I would he said I would take campaigns around the world and get the bride ready for the rapture his idea of money was going out to have services just go have services with people that don't have services now nothing wrong if you Birdman also says nothing wrong with building a building after coming allured hito is but we gotta examine ourselves do we think money is going to save the world or do we think holy ghost preaching is gonna save the world well we know anyone that can be saved it's gonna be few but they're gonna be saved by Holy Ghost preaching money does not say the world coz Peter said silver and gold have I none such as I have give I unto you so we can't focus on money it's got to be power we got to focus on the power of Christ I'm almost done this is this is my text now we're very familiar with this likewise also as was in days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thou shalt be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed the prophet speaking of Abraham and lot and Abraham did not represent any of those he was not a city he was looking for a kingdom uh-huh and he had a group with him and there was one of the three that stayed behind and showed him a sign of who he was with his back turn of the tent and know what Sarah said in the tent our discernment of spirit Jesus plainly saying now remember there was not one more sign done until Sodom was burned the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fulness in his church just before the fire Falls remember a lot was the one the fire the fire fell from the sky not not back in the days of Noah the water came but Christ Express what type of ministry would be in the days of lot and now we see the holy spirit moving among his church in the same manner we find it in the lair sink addition just as it was there sorry Abraham lived in a Laodicean condition but he overcame by separating himself by training his entire house he trained them to be faithful to the mysteries of God amen and God said I'll reveal to him the secret said to come because no he'll train his family I know they'll train his children about the message of the hour and that's what all of us parents should be doing train them about the truths in the message of the hour that's what Abraham did show them the mystery of marriage in divorce show the mystery of rapture the mystery of the Gentile dispensation we must show them these mysteries because Abraham seed loves the mysteries lot didn't have those Laden understand him Loretta said he forgot about the promised son he forgot about the rapture he was so caught up in love in Sodom that all the riches and everything there he forgot about the rapture it just became like a thought used to have a former thought used to think about the wrath Abraham used to talk about the rapture Abraham lived in the Laodicean condition in that beautiful oh my that's glorious Dorne adore the church spiritual was not in there in the beginning Pentecostal type watch that messenger come back to the church the speaking of when God came in flesh to Abraham his tent he set and talked to Abraham he said where is your wife Sarah he said Abraham which his name was Abram where is your wife Sarah remember her name was SAR RA and now it's sa RA H she's in the tent behind you behind you he said I'm going to visit you according time of life he said why did Sarah laugh when I said that there he is why would it be we got to have a spirit like that visit the church a spirit of prophetic a spirit of discernment and when it comes in the people refuse it why it's a Laodicea we're so documented with Creed's and things till we can't accept it that's right see I stand at the door and knock any man hears my voice you see that Sarah didn't want to hear the voice at first but aren't you glad later she did the Bible said she received strength to conceive seed amen she lied to God's face she didn't believe it at first she rejected it in her later seeing condition but God woke that bride up a man and she received strength to bring forth the promised son oh god wake us up amen wake us up get us eyes that see ears that hear go give us white raiment help us to see in here and receive strength for the body change amen hallelujah he said all my faith don't accept those things he's then you got the wrong faith that faith though you know the real genuine faith will punctuate every promise of God with an amen a genuine Holy Spirit why because the Holy Spirit the Bible yes amen how could the Holy Spirit be in you and you deny the Word of God you can't do it it's impossible number seven this is what I was so struck me when I heard this yesterday I sent Simon and cam and brother Brian Hawkins a text saying have you ever heard this quote before I was shocked then jesus beholding him the rich young ruler loved him and sent him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatever thou hast and give it to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieve from church for he had great possessions the only way I want to leave Church grieved is I want to leave grieve for lost souls I don't wanna leave grieve because I'm not willing to do what Jesus asked me to do does that mean is that clear all the only one I want to be grieved I want say all I want to see so saved all these abominations and accra just grieve me all the abominations in Albion they just grieve me I want to see somebody fill with the Holy Ghost amen I want to see a sinner weep their way to the cross that's the only grieve and I want to leave with when I leave church but see the Richard rule he left grieve because he knew he couldn't keep the word oh I could not leave with that I could not live with that preacher said I think I'm just going to keep investing in my money I'll just keep investing in my business my Bramson he was a businessman and because that the church has turned down the Holy Spirit east days it's increased look at this the church has turned down Christ and actually got more popular and now you're going to ecumenical councils just exactly what the Bible said you would do now you're really later to see a rich and increasing Goods just exactly like the young man was he was a type of the church rejecting Paul was a type of the one receiving both of them had the opportunity as you have tonight as I have the rich young ruler increased in goods he got more rich so as the church the leaders in church age increasing goods I remember he got so great to become so popular to even the Monarchs the great people begin to come and he had a great banquet one time now here's the call that struck me this man was religious he was by no means an infidel he had been taught by his mother how to do right how to walk how to dress himself he'd been taught by his father a great businessman how to be a successful businessman and his business was successful and father mother raised him up in the church and pointed to be up to the priest and the priest and made him a real religious man there was a fine culture man he was a fine boy with good character and that's that's the word that struck me yesterday his character was outstanding people say well I want godly character well that's that's good that though that just being what that's just wanting to be like the rich young ruler though we've got to say God finish the character in me he started with good character but he didn't finish with the right character and he wasn't brother man he wasn't playing around either he really loved God he tried to serve God if Jesus Christ looked at him and loved him there must have been something about the boy that was real look he had a real love for God he said what must I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus and the brother man said he had love he was real Jesus looked at him and loved him he had real character it wasn't a put-on in other words he was saying I won't commit adultery against my wife I won't lie to my neighbor I will not bear false witness I will keep the commands of God and he had real character there must have been something real outstanding about this young man he was a good character and a good character rating if you could rate him he was one he was near the top he was a man that was raised right intellectual smart successful business religious man he had a lot of good characteristics that was outstanding think about that he never broke the Ten Commandments never we're talking about one who had character here we're talking about can I say like this we're talking about someone who had victory because character is a it's not a gift brother Adam he wasn't born with the gift brother John he wasn't born with the gift for character he he had the victories he knew what it was like to get a victory oh the the priest read the Torah today I got the victory and he would walk out for the Jose with the victory character comes by victories and even a try of Jesus Christ the Savior but when he was confronted being successful in all these other things and he was as religious as can be because Jesus and questioning here he said I've cut these Commandments observed them off from my youth and here's a little here's the one that shocked me so he'd been brought up right taught right but when he was confronted with the thought of eternal life now once you notice with all this character I heard that I thought what I was driving yesterday what I driving home from church from study I'm like oh this character that's the thing that we want because we're not taking our clothes with us we're not taking our Bibles with us we're only taking our what that's all we're taking with us and he had all this character but what he do the Bible said it all got burned up right he sacrificed all this character he had such godly habits can you imagine he was so golly he never committed adultery he never lied he never worshiped any false God he never took the name of the Lord he never cussed and he had all this victory and at the moment when Jesus said sell out everything so give all your money away and follow me he dumped all this character like it went it went to the trash can he dumped all this godly real character in the trash can he said I'm gonna just try to be rich then and he walked away from being a pasal of Jesus Christ for what money he traded all this character for this little sin of money but member that sin will grow up sin is like a seed - it'll grow up I'll take you further than you want to go and ultimately strangle your life like it'll choke your life and that's what it did it started as a he's had a little seed of of a greed for money and he gave up all this gold all this godly character he put in the trash can I said well fine I'll just try to I can't live with that preacher saying I'll just plant this little seed of greed in my heart and it grew up and strangled his life where he had no life for Christ then so what's the state of your current character your past character Church it might have been real oh my look at this sisters look all all these years she lived live godly character but you've got to keep that character going thank God for your past victories thank God for all the gold but you can sell out the gold of your character just like the rich young ruler just like Judas did you've got to keep the victory I don't know yeah you've got to receive the end of your faith that's why that's why it's so important here what is Christ asking you to do today I'm not asking you to look back and say oh thank God you obeyed him I'm glad you obeyed him back there what is he asking you to do today because that's that's that's where the rich young ruler fell he obeyed everything in the past he had victory over custody he had Vicky only said the name of Lord was hallow it's holy he never costs the name of God but when it came down to greed he poured all of his golden to the gold of God and the spiritual trash can and he went after money went after fame popularity a very perfect type of the Laodicean Church age today the message of the hour asked you to give up money ask you to give up a job for Christ asked you to give up financial blessings for Christ and sacrifice of her Christ are we listening with the Holy Spirit sang or not I don't care how much character you've had in the past you've got to keep that character and obey the Word of God look at that it's just struck me that's why Jesus was asking him to be an apostle because look at the character he had amen jeez don't ask anybody to have it be an apostle he asked people that are called to be an apostle he had such character and the potential to be a mighty apostle like Paul but he sold it out for money and greed so that's why it's so important what is Christ asking us to sell out I just had a dream last night I know I've got to seek him more for I got to see more of Christ I said brother branham what's what's wrong with the church I'll conquer the church how can the church improve and he said you've got to seek God more I don't want my character to stop today I want my character to improve I don't want less victories I don't want to get a relaxed life a soft living I want more victories in Christ I know what it says it's gonna require more sacrifice number eight let's stand our feet I'm gonna just finish with this one it's about less than an hour oh I'm sorry okay yeah less than an hour and a half that's what I'm thinking okay forgive me I always think it's an hour is actually a her and a half when I get the one o'clock and I'm still preaching the eighth and fight now this is what I found out if you find more quotes help me up I looked at I think there was 22 or actually plus the ten where there was 32 total cuz I looked up different words like representing Leo to see a type layer to SIA and this is the eighth and final one that I have for today have you been blessed today Church I hope you've had all this character but I hope you want more character and you have to hear what is Christ asking me to do today am I willing to sacrifice that more character today what's my ministry today that's why I've always had a burden for that everybody needs to have a ministry of some sort what is he asking you to give today the character of the past is powerful but we've got to build upon that character and not sell it out the eighth and final one was brother BAM said David was a fugitive in 2nd Samuel my through 23 he was a fugitive to his own City buh-bam said like Christ is a fugitive fugitive to his own church he was kicked out on the outside looking in and let me read this quote here this is the only one I'd didn't have time to really get up there well you know I'll just skipped I'll just read this what a type of today Christ effusion you say Christ is a fugitive according to the Bible God has gallantly taken us through these seven Church ages this latest see in church Christ was a fugitive outside of his church rejected trying to get back into the church see he's a fugitive to his own church and the reason he's a fugitive is because he was the word and they won't let the word in they've accepted Creed's instead and we find out that in this great struggle those gallant man around around David were Gentiles oh can we give the Lord a round of applause amen hallelujah oh my and you know the court probably program said and even why the least of Jesus's thoughts was a command to the Gentile people so it is today the least of Jesus's thoughts or how about his word should be a command to the Gentiles who love him how many love the Lord Jesus we've got to love him we've got to love Jesus Christ with all of our hearts if he's asking us to give up anything I believe he asked me last night to give up something I'm not even quite sure honestly at this point when I supposed to give up but I'm gonna seek him and I'm gonna pray it ask God Lord what must I give up to seek you more I didn't know how much more I could give up but I've got to seek Him to do that because I want to I want to see the church succeed don't you now remember Church we have your you have the choice everybody here's a choice you're gonna make this church go like this higher and higher and higher or it's gonna drop down every church every Church has that albian you know Sheffield Lorraine every Church it's the people's choice in my choice we're all choosing our church is either and they'll keep going up after struggles and struggle and struggles or it's gonna turn down Jesus and go down and down I've got a choice how many know that you have a choice - that's just bow our heads let me just ask you for a moment here I'm thankful for the character I see in the people of this church I tell my wife and I you know we talking I say thank God for the people that support the church with all they have I'm so thankful for the character it's such a blessing to me to know that God placed me here in Akron and there's people that supported a hundred percent I appreciate that I appreciate that very much and I thank God for the godly character of the Saints but I feel we've got to give more for Christ our character the past thank God for those victories but I believe Jesus wants to have a more victory today I mean would say amen to that I appreciate the character I appreciate the daily devotion and sacrifice for the gospel I wonder through that dream if the Lord doesn't ask in myself and the church maybe he's not asking you to seek him more I don't know I just don't see how that's biblical if he's not asking you to seek him more as me the pastor as well to seek him more how many wanna only raise your hands say Lord I want to find you more in my life I'm gonna bless those hands because memory said if you want to find me you got to seek me with all search let me pray for you please pray for me pray for one another let's just raise our hands because maybe some of us can raise our hands and lift up holy hands to God Heavenly Father our holy hands are lifted up thank you for the character of this church or not to tell my wife and I Lord I tell you thank you for the character the people who support this church we couldn't have it without them there would be no message Church in Akron sure could if it wasn't for the character of the people Lord to support it with their ties offerings there I'm there amens their sacrifice on the roads how they staying clean now they stay in new things Lord we appreciate the character hallelujah yet with all that character we've had our prayers that you help us to have more character help us not to quit elbows not to turn and walk away help us not to grieve the Holy Spirit in whatever ministry whatever you're asking us to do Lord I know you're asking me to seek you more Lord Jesus thank you for that visitation Lord last night I just believe it was I don't see how the devil would ever say seek Christ more you're not seeking Christ in them I believe that was the Holy Spirit but I've always wanted to live in the days of brother Branham Lord God and just be around his ministry and I felt like in that little dream Lord you give me an opportunity to feel what it was like in order you were trying to correct me and show me that there's more I can give and that reminds me now of the message to the Thyatira church age your last works were more than your first help my life help me as leader my family a leader of this church help me Jesus to seek you more dear God I want to be more interested in my ministry more interested in the role of a pastor and a father I want to be more interested I want to hear your voice Lord God and I want to stay in your presence I don't want to walk away like the rich young ruler I want to be like the Gentile army that was around David said Jesus whatever your least thing you want to happen to church I'll do it if nobody else we're doing Jesus I'll do it because the very least of your desires is my command let me just say thank you Jesus I love you Lord Jesus let me just praise you with my lips thank you for amazing grace thank you for calling me out of the world thank you for calling me out of the Judas Jezebel church's lujah Oh hallelujah thank you lord thank you it's a privilege Lord to be in this message Lord God to walk in the truth of the scripture where we're not built upon foundation of sand but on the rock of Revelation amen thank you Jesus it's absolute privilege Lord to serve you Lord let my life be a sacrifice Lord let it be a living sacrifice you saw the hands that were raised Lord God hallelujah with all that character Lord grant us more character than a sufferer through the fiery afflictions Lord to produce more christ-like gold in our lives more
