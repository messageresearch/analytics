[0:00] Perhaps they're sick or perhaps uh you
[0:02] know the cares of life have come in.
[0:03] We've been preaching on the cares of
[0:04] life, you know, anxieties or cares of
[0:07] riches and so forth like that. Let's
[0:08] pray for everybody as well by God's
[0:10] grace. Let's read verse 12.
[0:14] Let's read that on three. 1 2 3. For we
[0:17] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[0:20] against principalities, against powers,
[0:23] against the rulers of the darkness of
[0:26] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[0:28] in high places. Let's have one more word
[0:30] of prayer. Father God, we thank you for
[0:32] tonight. Lord, thank you for the saints
[0:33] who press their way out to the house of
[0:34] God. Bless your people, Lord. Feed them,
[0:36] Lord. They're your sheep. They're the
[0:38] sheep of your pasture, Lord God. And I'm
[0:40] just here as a earthly shepherd trying
[0:42] to get the mind of the spiritual great
[0:44] shepherd and feed your people tonight,
[0:46] Lord God. So just bless us with thy
[0:48] word. Thank you again for all the
[0:49] efforts that have been made to be here,
[0:51] especially our mothers and those that
[0:52] have worked all day, took days off, Lord
[0:54] God. We're so grateful for all these
[0:56] efforts. May the time be used uh uh in a
[0:59] wise way, Lord, in a a successful way. I
[1:02] ask it in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[1:04] saints said, "Amen." God bless you as
[1:06] you're being seated. Praise God.
[1:10] So, we look at part four here tonight.
[1:12] Now, I do have one slide in case you I
[1:13] was going to put this one up here. Um, I
[1:16] want to start with the quote
[1:19] that I ended with on uh Sunday morning.
[1:25] As I read this, hopefully you remember
[1:26] it. By God's grace, this is a beautiful
[1:28] quote. This is in the section where
[1:30] brother Ram talks about uh Jesus
[1:32] overcame and because he overcame, we can
[1:35] all overcome.
[1:37] So, how many understand you're in a
[1:38] wrestling match? Praise God.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Satan would even
[1:41] attack and wrestle our sisters. Isn't
[1:43] that something? What a what a awful
[1:45] adversary. He'd even wrestle women. What
[1:47] a wicked man he is. What a wicked evil
[1:49] man spirit he is. But this is what we
[1:52] ended with. And u brother Ran told us
[1:55] that Jesus got the victory because he
[1:57] always obeyed the word of God. So it
[1:59] doesn't matter what we're tempted with.
[2:01] It matters are we going to use the word
[2:03] of God or not.
[2:04] So no matter what you fought this week,
[2:06] it doesn't matter. The word gives you
[2:08] the victory.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the last paragraph, I
[2:13] believe, in the quote, if I'm not
[2:14] mistaken, before he goes on to the next
[2:16] section in chapter nine. But let's just
[2:18] briefly, I just want to briefly review
[2:20] this real quick. Uh, there will not be
[2:21] one person who will sit in the throne of
[2:23] the Lord Jesus unless he has been living
[2:24] that word. Now, let me stop right there.
[2:26] Is David going to sit there?
[2:29] Yeah, David's going to sit there for
[2:31] sure. Uh, it did. Uh, but did David
[2:34] murder and did David commit adultery?
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Moses was a murderer. Is he gonna sit
[2:38] there?
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, what I want you to see is that
[2:42] there's a spot for you at the throne,
[2:46] &gt;&gt; right? Despite our mistakes, there's a
[2:49] there's a there's a throne. There's a
[2:51] seat for you at the throne.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus has the main throne, but around
[2:54] him are the saints who will judge the
[2:57] earth.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; The saints will judge angels. The saints
[3:02] will judge the whole earth.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So just be be assured
[3:06] there's a seat for you. If you can
[3:07] overcome, there's a seat for you.
[3:09] Hallelujah.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, your prayers, your fastings,
[3:14] your repentances. Now, these three I'm
[3:15] going to look at just again a little
[3:16] briefly. No matter what you present to
[3:18] God, none of that will gain you the
[3:20] privilege of sitting on that throne. But
[3:21] again, will David be there? Moses, all
[3:24] these people, Samson who made it to the
[3:26] Hall of Fame of faith
[3:29] &gt;&gt; despite uh uh giving in to immoral women
[3:34] uh despite all the the the disgrace he
[3:38] brought upon the nation of Israel and
[3:39] his family, we'd say, yet he's still in
[3:42] the Hall of Fame of faith
[3:44] &gt;&gt; because of repentance. Hallelujah. So
[3:45] other words, God received his
[3:47] repentance. But there are repentances
[3:49] God won't receive like Judas's because
[3:52] he didn't repent to the right person.
[3:54] But if you repent of Jesus, there's a
[3:56] seat for you.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It will be granted
[4:01] only to the word bride. And why are we
[4:03] here tonight, church? Because we all
[4:04] believe the same thing about the word.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; There's only one baptism in the name of
[4:08] the Lord Jesus Christ. Right? God's not
[4:10] three persons. God's one person.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Women should dress modest. So should
[4:14] men. Women should have long hair. Men
[4:16] should have short hair. We all agree on
[4:17] that. Hallelujah. We're the word bride.
[4:20] Those are just a few examples out of the
[4:21] hundreds. Amen. As the throne of the
[4:25] king is shared with the queen, because
[4:27] she's united to him, so only they who
[4:29] are of that word, even as he is of that
[4:32] word will share that throne.
[4:35] Now, let's go over those examples. I
[4:36] ended with prayers. Muslims pray five
[4:39] times a day, probably more than you,
[4:41] right? Unless we're praying throughout
[4:43] the day in our hearts, right? But will
[4:45] Muslims sit on the throne with Jesus?
[4:47] No. They do. Did you know they deny that
[4:49] Jesus was even crucified? They believe
[4:52] Jesus was a prophet, but they believe he
[4:54] was resurrected and didn't die. He just
[4:56] went straight to heaven. They believe
[4:57] Allah took him to heaven. That's what
[4:58] the videos I've seen of at least of
[5:00] Muslims what they say. So they deny the
[5:03] blood of Jesus Christ. So how are they
[5:05] going to be saved? They can't be saved
[5:06] if they deny the blood of Jesus Christ.
[5:08] So no matter how much they pray, those
[5:10] prayers will not gain them a seat by the
[5:13] throne of God.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what we're talking
[5:15] about. Now, another example I want to
[5:17] give you is a more recent example.
[5:19] There's a man named Mike Bickl, and he
[5:21] ran he ran You heard it, Brother Chris?
[5:24] Yes. In the 90s, he started a 247
[5:29] prayer and song service. It goes 24
[5:32] hours, seven days a week. And the
[5:35] leaders would, you know, they they
[5:36] they'd be like the song leaders. They
[5:38] would sing and pray for three-hour
[5:39] sessions. So, there's four groups and
[5:42] they would just rotate every day. And
[5:44] it's been going on for over 20, 30
[5:47] years. Okay? Now, think about that. Now,
[5:49] that that that's the foundation.
[5:52] They can pray now, church. They're
[5:54] praying uh they're praying 247 at that
[5:57] church. But it just came out Mike Bickl
[5:59] has been abusing women for over 20
[6:02] years.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Mike Winger. He tore him up. Boy,
[6:06] he sure I appreciate him. Yes, I like
[6:08] him. Most things he does, not everything
[6:10] because he's against brother Ram, but
[6:11] we're against him in that way.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; You're right. Yes. Yeah. It's a great
[6:22] sacrifice.
[6:23] Yes. But the point I want to bring out
[6:26] of that is that although they were
[6:28] sincere, they were sincerely praying
[6:29] 24/7,
[6:31] yet for 20 years he would lie to the
[6:32] women. He'd say, "Oh, now here's how he
[6:34] lied. He say, "The Lord gave me a
[6:36] vision. My wife's going to die, so
[6:37] you're going to be in my next wife, so
[6:39] we might as well have time together now,
[6:41] and I'm not going to go far on that."
[6:43] Look at these demon-possessed people.
[6:45] Yet, he would get up there and pray,
[6:46] church, for three, he'd pray for three
[6:48] hours straight. So, see, as much as you
[6:51] pray and do all these things, that's not
[6:53] going to gain you a seat by Jesus. It's
[6:55] only those who live the word of God.
[6:57] Hallelujah.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can pray five times a day. You
[7:00] can pray for three hours straight for
[7:01] for 30 years at a time. But if you don't
[7:04] live the word, there's no seat for you.
[7:06] Hallelujah.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Now, fastings, as I said, the Pharisees
[7:10] fasted twice a week. They didn't eat all
[7:13] day from sun up to sun down. Which of
[7:15] us, don't raise your hand. Which of us
[7:16] have done that?
[7:18] But there'll be no seat for them because
[7:19] they denied Jesus Christ as savior.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; So, see, just fasting twice a week isn't
[7:25] enough to get you by the throne of Jesus
[7:27] Christ. You got to fast with the right
[7:29] heart
[7:31] &gt;&gt; and the right intentions. Hallelujah.
[7:35] And then the third one was repentance.
[7:37] Esau repented. We just read it at our
[7:38] house. We go through the book of went
[7:40] through Revelation. Now we're going
[7:41] through Genesis. He cried and said,
[7:43] "Dad, don't you have any other blessings
[7:45] for me?" And so he God, his dad did
[7:47] bless him. He did get a blessing. But
[7:50] after that, he went and lived worldly
[7:52] anyway and live wickedly, right? So even
[7:55] that it depends. As we said, it depends
[7:58] how you repent. Judas said, "I'm sorry."
[7:59] He got rid of the money, but he didn't
[8:01] repent to Jesus. He repented to the
[8:03] people he took the money from. Church,
[8:05] if we just repent to Jesus, there will
[8:07] be a seat for us in heaven. Hallelujah.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we repent the right way, if we
[8:12] fast the right way, if we pray the right
[8:15] way, we will reign with Jesus Christ
[8:17] because we re we're reigning right now
[8:20] over sin.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. Overcomers by the
[8:24] grace of God overcoming Leodysia.
[8:28] Okay. Okay. So, now does that help a
[8:29] little bit? I wanted to balance that out
[8:31] because some people look at that and
[8:32] they're like they might even myself over
[8:34] the years I've got sometimes I got
[8:35] discouraged reading that like my well
[8:36] then how am I going to ever how am I
[8:38] ever going to reign.
[8:40] But this is in the same section where
[8:42] Jesus overcame by quoting the word of
[8:44] God. So if we get the context, the
[8:46] context is you overcome over the whole
[8:48] span of your life.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; And as long as you're repenting,
[8:52] praying, and fasting the right way,
[8:55] there will be a seed for you.
[8:56] Hallelujah.
[8:58] Okay. So, you can click off that now.
[8:59] Just get some scriptures ready, hun.
[9:02] All right. Now, does that make sense? I
[9:03] hope that's a blessing. I wanted to I
[9:06] felt I had to end it, you know, kind of
[9:07] quickly on Well, maybe maybe not
[9:09] quickly, but I just I didn't I didn't
[9:11] know if everybody caught that thought. I
[9:12] wanted to just get that thought. Malachi
[9:14] mentioned on Sunday night. I thought,
[9:15] well, let me just uh spend a little more
[9:17] time on that by God's grace. Church, as
[9:20] I said, David's going to be there. Moses
[9:22] is going to be there. Samson's going to
[9:24] be there. The Queen of the South is
[9:25] going to be there. the men of Nineveh
[9:27] are going to be there and God's going to
[9:30] raise up the men of Nineveh because they
[9:32] got in in dust and and sackcloth and
[9:35] ashes and apologized to God and God
[9:37] spared their city.
[9:41] So if they're if they'll be there, we
[9:43] should be there by God's grace as well.
[9:45] But Chris,
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Queen of the South, okay, that's in the
[9:49] book of uh first kings when Solomon was
[9:52] king. The queen of south crossed the
[9:54] desert in order to see Solomon. And the
[9:56] Bible said she came to prove him with
[9:58] hard questions.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; We're not given the name. She's just
[10:02] called the queen of the south. And
[10:04] brother, she was ready. Uh, you know,
[10:06] all she knew is idols, right? So, she
[10:08] was ready. She heard about his wisdom
[10:09] and she thought, well, if if God's with
[10:11] him, I'm going to bring all this gold to
[10:14] bless him if it's truly God. And brother
[10:16] Bam said, Brother Bam said, apply that
[10:18] to us. If God shows us he's God, then we
[10:20] should support God's ministry with
[10:22] everything we got. Amen. And this and
[10:25] God has proved to me that this Bible
[10:26] revelation from William Brandham is the
[10:28] truth of God.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; So that's why I support it with all I
[10:31] got. And so do you. And the church said,
[10:34] &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah. That's why I support it
[10:36] with all I got." Good question, brother.
[10:38] Um Jesus talks about it as well. And
[10:40] brother, the whole point of her life was
[10:42] to to make a sacrifice on traveling.
[10:45] because she made a sacrifice to hear the
[10:47] word of God. She'll judge all those
[10:49] Pharisees who wouldn't even uh travel
[10:51] across the city to hear Jesus preach.
[10:54] She crossed an entire desert. They won't
[10:56] even cross the city. So, she'll judge
[10:58] them and they'll go to hell because they
[11:00] wouldn't cross the city to hear Jesus
[11:02] preach.
[11:03] So, Brother Chris and all of us, we got
[11:05] to look at what is the challenge in our
[11:07] lives to to serve God in the message.
[11:09] That's what we must accomplish because
[11:11] that's what God will use to judge other
[11:13] people. I got a feeling, uh, Sister
[11:16] Kristen, that God's going to use us to
[11:18] judge people that wouldn't have a church
[11:19] because it was so small.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; I got a feeling God's going to raise up
[11:24] my wife and I. When people make excuses,
[11:26] well, I couldn't live the message
[11:28] because the church would have been too
[11:30] small. Well, we put up with it. We serve
[11:31] God with a small church. We're willing
[11:34] to sacrifice. Or what about the people
[11:36] that said, "Oh, uh, we had to go on
[11:38] birth control pills and and all these
[11:41] babies lost their lives because we just
[11:42] didn't know if we could handle it
[11:43] financially." Who's God going to raise
[11:46] up? My wife and I.
[11:48] We believed it. We trusted God. Although
[11:50] things weren't easy for us financially
[11:52] all the time. Oh, I didn't have a big
[11:54] enough a big enough house to have more
[11:56] children. Uh, so we went on birth
[11:58] control pills and and God will raise up
[11:59] my wife and I. We don't have an
[12:01] extremely large house. Hallelujah. So
[12:04] look, look at the trials of your life.
[12:07] What what are the biggest trials? If you
[12:09] succeed in that trial, in giving God
[12:12] praise in that trial, God's going to use
[12:14] you as a testimony on the day of
[12:16] judgment. Hallelujah.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; That you overcame. You didn't make
[12:19] excuses. Amen.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; You didn't make excuses about, well,
[12:22] this is why I lost the wrestling match
[12:24] to Satan. This is why I let Satan
[12:25] wrestle me down and choke me out and I
[12:27] didn't live the word of God. There'll be
[12:29] no excuses. Hallelujah. Amen.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; None. There are no excuses to why you
[12:36] can't overcome.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:48] I think uh because of time
[12:52] I will u
[12:55] I'll just get two more thoughts. Okay.
[12:57] Two more. Give me a short sermon
[12:59] tonight. Boy. People are sure going to
[13:02] share that on the they're going to share
[13:03] it on social media. Brother Jesse only
[13:05] preached 30 minutes. Oh my goodness,
[13:07] what's going on in his life? Come talk
[13:09] to me. I'll tell you.
[13:12] Uh I want to go to Psalm 51 verse one
[13:16] 1-2. Uh maybe I'll just get one thought.
[13:18] We'll see.
[13:20] Uh when Adam was here, he shared a few
[13:22] things that really struck me I want to
[13:24] bring out to the church regarding
[13:25] wrestling matches.
[13:27] So, if you haven't listen, if you want
[13:29] to listen to his full testimony, let me
[13:30] know. If you sisters haven't, I can
[13:32] share it with you. I shared it with a
[13:34] couple people. They really enjoyed it.
[13:36] Simon loved it. Simon's like, I shared
[13:37] it with numerous people. Simon really
[13:38] liked that testimony.
[13:41] Um, but the the this section, now in
[13:44] this section, I want to bring out this
[13:45] thought. Victory comes when we own our
[13:49] mistakes.
[13:51] In other words, you'll get the victory
[13:52] in wrestling if you just admit your
[13:55] mistakes.
[13:57] You know, some people say, "Well, I
[13:58] can't get the victory. I can't get the
[13:59] victory." And they blame everybody else.
[14:01] In other words, excuses. Okay, maybe
[14:03] that's the key word for tonight. Let's
[14:04] not make excuses. No excuses.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; If we lose a wrestling match, it's not
[14:09] somebody else's fault, it's our fault.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:14] So, in in Psalm 51, um this is the this
[14:18] is the song David wrote after he
[14:20] murdered and committed adultery and hid
[14:22] it from everybody.
[14:24] Not only did he murder and adultery, he
[14:26] hid it from everybody and God had to
[14:28] come and and send a prophet in order to
[14:30] make it known. In other words, he was
[14:33] comfortable living with hidden sin.
[14:36] Right? He was just planning, well, I'm
[14:38] just going to live the rest of my life.
[14:39] I'm not going to tell anybody about it.
[14:43] Right now, church, there's some things,
[14:44] right? There's some things we don't want
[14:45] to broadcast publicly, but we should
[14:47] admit them to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Okay? So what I'm saying is
[14:54] let's hope when we sin it's just between
[14:56] us and God and we don't have to deal
[14:58] with any public consequences.
[15:00] Okay?
[15:02] But there's nothing wrong with hiding
[15:03] your sin if you've already confessed it,
[15:06] right? Hide your sin if it was just
[15:07] between you and God. Hide it, but
[15:09] confess it to Jesus Christ.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then then the guilt goes
[15:14] away. Then the shame goes away. And the
[15:15] church said,
[15:16] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. Have mercy on upon me, oh God,
[15:19] according to thy loving kindness,
[15:21] according unto the multitude of thy
[15:24] tender mercies, blot out mine. Okay,
[15:25] leave it up there. Mine. Whose
[15:27] transgressions were they? Mine. So, Adam
[15:31] got victory when he realized, wow, this
[15:32] is these this trouble with drugs and any
[15:36] sexual sin. This is my fault.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Now, church, he could have been tempted
[15:41] to say, well, this is my dad's fault
[15:43] because I got divorced. my dad divorced
[15:44] my mom.
[15:46] We could have said, "Well, maybe I I
[15:48] just didn't get the love for my mom or
[15:50] the love for my dad."
[15:52] There's no excuses for our sin.
[15:54] Hallelujah.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Right. Verse two.
[15:59] Wash me thoroughly from whose iniquity
[16:01] was it?
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Mine.
[16:04] Hallelujah. And cleanse me from whose
[16:06] sin? My sin. Okay. So, see, he's taking
[16:10] ownership. This is my iniquity. This is
[16:13] my sin. It's not somebody else's. I'm
[16:15] not pointing any fingers. Oh, it's
[16:16] Bashibba's fault. She should not have
[16:18] been bathing or whatever she was doing.
[16:19] Who knows what she was doing, church? We
[16:21] don't even know. Somehow there's
[16:22] something with bathing out in public.
[16:24] And isn't that like men sometimes men
[16:26] just want to blame women, right? Because
[16:28] they're the weaker vessel. Shame on a
[16:31] man that would do that.
[16:34] You won't be blaming anybody on the day
[16:36] of judgment. Just yourself.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:40] Can't blame anybody else.
[16:42] You know, I need to find this verse. But
[16:44] in the Old Testament, in Jeremiah, it
[16:45] said God gave the people false teachers
[16:49] because of their own sin.
[16:52] In other words, a false teacher is a
[16:54] reward to a a congregation that doesn't
[16:57] love the word of God.
[16:59] So then what's a real preacher then?
[17:04] Well, I thought I'd get a more than one
[17:05] amen on that.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Then what's a faithful faithful
[17:09] preacher? And that's a reward because
[17:10] you love the word.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; That's better. I know it's Wednesday
[17:15] night.
[17:18] Hallelujah. Thank God. I want to be a
[17:20] faithful minister. I want you to be a
[17:21] faithful church. Hallelujah.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Let's wrestle against the Satan. Let's
[17:25] beat him. Hallelujah.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Let's choke him out, not him choke us
[17:28] out.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; And Adam kept saying these words,
[17:32] remember Chris, selfishness. It was my
[17:35] selfishness.
[17:38] And that's true for all of us. Genevie
[17:41] wrote me a letter and said, "Oh, Daddy,
[17:42] I just pray uh I just pray for you that
[17:45] you won't get choked out and I won't get
[17:46] choked out." I thought that meant a lot
[17:48] to me. Genevie, you keep praying for me,
[17:50] Genevie, that I don't get choked out.
[17:51] Hallelujah. And I keep wrestling against
[17:53] Satan and throw him down in Jesus name.
[17:55] Hallelujah.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, see, that's owning. When you
[18:00] own your sin, it's you say, "Yes, it's
[18:02] my sin. It was my selfishness. It was my
[18:04] pride. It was my lust. It was my
[18:07] arrogance. It was my fear. It was my
[18:09] unbelief. It was my distraction. Don't
[18:11] blame other people if it's your fault.
[18:13] Hallelujah.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; And so that's how Adam got the victory
[18:17] through his wrestling match. He had to
[18:20] own the sin.
[18:22] Okay. Now, the prodigal son, Luke 15:18.
[18:25] Chris and I were talking about this one
[18:26] after service on Sunday. And I want to
[18:28] say I appreciate everybody leaving here
[18:30] quietly because I said leave here
[18:31] quietly. There's people praying in here.
[18:33] I appreciate everybody doing. Thank you,
[18:34] children.
[18:35] There's tithes. Everybody's happy. No
[18:37] one's no one's at the altar. We can
[18:38] shake hands, say, "I sure love you,
[18:40] brother May." Okay. Brother Chris, I
[18:42] love you. I love you, Jose. But if
[18:44] somebody's praying, we need to get out
[18:45] of the sanctuary if we're not going to
[18:47] pray for them. Okay? Keep the anointing
[18:50] of the Holy Ghost in the building.
[18:51] Everybody understand by God's grace.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Most time we do a wonderful job of that.
[18:56] You can hear it on brother's tapes, too.
[18:57] Sometimes if it's a real sincerious
[18:59] service, he's like, "Exit right away."
[19:01] If not, he say he says, "Shake each one
[19:03] another's hand. Greet one another by the
[19:05] grace of God." Luke 15:18. Now, the
[19:08] prodigal is in the most abominable place
[19:10] he could be with pigs. Pigs were an
[19:13] abomination to Jews, right? In other
[19:15] words, he's in the dirtiest place he
[19:17] could be. How does he get the victory
[19:19] out of this wrestling match? He's
[19:20] getting whipped in his wrestling match.
[19:22] Satan has thrown him in abomination.
[19:24] It'd be like a woman today wearing
[19:26] pants, right, in in adultery or
[19:29] fornication or something like that. or a
[19:32] man uh in a bar or a man uh sleeping
[19:35] around with a bunch of women like a
[19:36] whoremonger. It'd be like that in
[19:39] abominable condition wearing shorts and
[19:41] watching porn and doing all kinds of
[19:43] wickedness like that. It'd be like that
[19:44] today. Something really wicked.
[19:47] And how does he get victory? How does he
[19:49] win the wrestling match? How does he get
[19:51] strength? He owns it.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; See that? He doesn't blame other people
[19:57] for his mistake. He recognized it's my
[19:59] mistake.
[20:02] I will arise and go to my father. And I
[20:04] was saying to my father, uh, it's all
[20:06] your fault. Did I read that right?
[20:08] &gt;&gt; No, he don't blame his daddy. He don't
[20:11] blame his mama. He blames himself.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; May God help us. If we sin, help us to
[20:17] blame ourselves.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how you get the
[20:21] victory in the wrestling match. Blame
[20:23] who's guilty. You're guilty. I'm guilty.
[20:26] When we sin, we're all guilty.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Appreciate That amen corner
[20:31] there, sisters. Hallelujah. That's a
[20:33] healthy amen right there. I have sinned
[20:36] against heaven and before thee. Notice,
[20:39] I've sinned against God and heaven.
[20:42] I sinned against the kingdom of God and
[20:44] I've sinned against God. I'm sorry, my
[20:47] father. Yes. I've sinned against heaven
[20:48] and I've sinned against my dad. Next
[20:51] verse.
[20:53] And am no more worthy to be called thy
[20:55] son. Make me as one of thy hired
[20:57] servants. Now look at this. I'm unw Look
[20:59] at that. I'm unworthy, church. So,
[21:01] brother Chris, this is how I was trying
[21:03] to teach you how to pray. We got to pray
[21:05] and say, "God, I'm unworthy." Sometimes
[21:06] I repeat that, "I'm unworthy. I'm
[21:08] unworthy. I'm nothing. I'm nothing. I'm
[21:10] nothing." And it brings humility to
[21:12] myself. Realize I am nothing.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; If God terries, I'm going to have a
[21:17] funeral, too, like everybody else.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; So, I want to realize I'm nothing, and I
[21:22] want to have faith in God. Hallelujah.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; I want to take the blame upon myself if
[21:27] it's my sin. I want to own the sin and I
[21:30] want to ask God to forgive me of my sin.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; See, I'm not worthy, but in other words,
[21:36] I'm not worthy, but take me in. Let me
[21:39] have whatever position I can have in the
[21:41] kingdom. Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Whether I'm whether I'm the last seat
[21:44] away from the throne. Even if I'm the
[21:46] last seat, let me sit beside you, Jesus.
[21:49] Amen.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy, but I want at least the
[21:53] least seat. Could I just have the least
[21:55] seat? I want to come home. I want to be
[21:58] forgiven. I need your love, God.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:03] So, that's how you do it. I've sinned
[22:05] against you. I've sinned against heaven.
[22:07] I'm not worthy of this, but I still want
[22:09] to be accepted somehow. I still want to
[22:11] make it in the rapture. There it is. I
[22:14] still want to make it to heaven. Amen.
[22:16] God, make a way. I recognize I own my
[22:18] sin, but receive me back if there's a
[22:20] way. Hallelujah.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; And church, there is a way because Jesus
[22:23] is the way.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Glory. Verse 20.
[22:28] And he arose and came to his father. But
[22:30] when he was yet a far way off, his
[22:32] father saw him and he had compassion,
[22:35] ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
[22:38] This is the God we serve. God has
[22:40] compassion on us. God can't wait for us
[22:43] to get the wrestling victory.
[22:44] Hallelujah.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is everybody hearing me?
[22:50] &gt;&gt; God cannot wait. He's waiting. I can't
[22:53] wait till brother gets a victory. I
[22:55] can't wait till sister finally takes the
[22:57] word of God and gets the victory.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; He can't wait.
[23:02] And I'll say like this. He can't wait
[23:03] whether you come up for prayer or he
[23:05] can't wait till you confess at your
[23:06] chair or he can't wait till you go and
[23:08] make that right with somebody. He can't
[23:10] wait. He He's looking for it. He
[23:12] believe. He knows it's going to happen.
[23:14] And then church, look what he does. He's
[23:15] going to do exceedingly abundantly for
[23:17] you more than you can ask or think. In
[23:20] other words, if you can just repent and
[23:22] take ownership of your sin, God's going
[23:24] to reward you in ways you can't imagine.
[23:26] Hallelujah.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[23:30] Verse 21.
[23:33] And the son said unto him, "Father, I've
[23:35] sinned against heaven, and in thy sight,
[23:37] am no more worthy be called thy son."
[23:38] Verse 22.
[23:41] But the father said to his servants,
[23:42] "Bring forth the best robe, and put it
[23:44] on him, and put a ring on his hand, and
[23:46] shoes on his feet." We'll stop right
[23:47] there. The church said,
[23:50] So David owned it. The prodigal owned
[23:52] it, right? And David got a great
[23:55] blessing, too. God gave the covenant.
[23:57] Your seed will always have a king that
[23:59] sits on the throne.
[24:01] Right? What's he get? He gets the robe.
[24:03] He gets the ring. He gets the authority.
[24:05] He gets a new clothes, which is the
[24:06] righteousness of Jesus Christ. As we saw
[24:08] on Sunday with the the armor of God, the
[24:11] breastplate is the righteousness. Uh and
[24:13] then the Bible said the white robe like
[24:14] robe like fine linen is the
[24:16] righteousness of Jesus Christ. So we see
[24:18] the spiritual connection. Oh yeah. And
[24:20] brother Kirsty talked about this in this
[24:22] story is the three works of grace.
[24:24] The first work is when he repented in
[24:26] the pig pen. He got a change of mind.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; The second work is walking back to
[24:31] daddy's house.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; The third work put a ring on him. Put a
[24:36] robe on him. Give him authority. He's a
[24:38] new man. Hallelujah.
[24:41] Three works of grace. Hallelujah. Amen.
[24:44] You remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,
[24:46] that came to me while we were talking,
[24:47] brother. Either you or Austin, I can't
[24:49] remember. I was like, that's right.
[24:50] There are three works in there. Pig pen,
[24:52] travel, re reception with his father.
[24:58] Now, I'll just have to close this going.
[25:00] I'm just going to close with this
[25:01] thought here in the next few minutes.
[25:04] Brother Adam said he had to own his sin.
[25:07] So Adam's he said it in that uh rehab
[25:10] place and he said that remember he said
[25:12] that man walked by him the preacher
[25:14] walked by him that day and the hair sit
[25:16] up on his his arms. I said Adam what was
[25:19] it about that service that blessed you?
[25:21] And he said that preacher preached you
[25:24] got to own your sin.
[25:27] And that preacher said, "All you men in
[25:30] here, your wives are going to be uh
[25:33] alone or with another man, and it's your
[25:36] fault." Now, that's a sermon right
[25:38] there.
[25:40] Yeah. He's saying, "You got to own it."
[25:42] And then he said, Adam, the thing that
[25:44] hit Adam, he said, "Uh, you've got to
[25:46] own it. Your children, if you got
[25:47] children out there, someone else is
[25:49] going to raise them and it's your
[25:50] fault."
[25:53] In other words, you've got to own it.
[25:56] And so he went up for prayer. Adam said
[25:58] he just laid hands on him and he said he
[26:00] felt like God pulled that addiction of
[26:02] crack and cocaine. Pulled it right out
[26:05] of him.
[26:07] Hallelujah. Absolutely.
[26:10] A demon was cast out and the church said
[26:13] &gt;&gt; and he said instantly he had didn't have
[26:15] that desire anymore.
[26:17] Right. But then the devil tries to
[26:18] attack him. You know we all get we all
[26:19] go through seasons of of temptation like
[26:21] that. But that was the sermon that
[26:24] brought it down where the rubber meets
[26:26] the road. It's my fault. Everything's my
[26:28] fault. It's not other people's fault.
[26:30] I'm gonna stop blaming the devil.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; The devil's going to be there no matter
[26:37] what.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[26:39] The devil can't make you do anything.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; The reality is when we sin, we give in
[26:45] to the devil,
[26:48] &gt;&gt; right? He can't make you do anything.
[26:52] You do it, you sin because you want to
[26:54] sin.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; And let me say it like this, church. You
[27:00] can't blame the government
[27:03] &gt;&gt; for why life is so hard. You cannot
[27:05] blame them.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Governments have been a lot worse than
[27:07] our government. Now, we got a good We
[27:10] got a good president now with a good
[27:11] cabinet. It's true. Much better. I mean,
[27:15] good in good is uh just a general word
[27:18] there, you know. It's better than what
[27:20] it was.
[27:21] Not wholly good, but better.
[27:24] But you can't blame you you can't blame
[27:26] the economy. Well, because I don't have
[27:28] money, I'm going to go do this sin and
[27:29] that sin and that sin. No, you can't
[27:30] blame the economy either.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; The devil can't make you do it. The
[27:35] economy, the government, you can't
[27:36] blame, well, that woman dressed that
[27:38] way, so I had to do it. Or that man was
[27:41] just so handsome. He had those beautiful
[27:42] blue eyes and whatever he had, I just
[27:44] had to go out on a date with him.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; No. No. You can't blame anybody else.
[27:49] You got to blame yourself. Amen.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz you're the only one
[27:52] wrestling.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; You're not wrestling that handsome guy.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; You're not wrestling that attractive
[28:00] woman.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; You're wrestling an evil spirit.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; And let me share this. I heard brother
[28:07] Ram say this today just in passing.
[28:10] Brother Ram said there's some spirits
[28:11] that look like a bat. Right? We saw that
[28:12] in Revelation.
[28:14] She said he said uh
[28:17] which one looks like a turtle? um ep
[28:20] epilepsy. He said epilepsy looks like a
[28:22] turtle.
[28:24] He said, "But oppression, listen, looks
[28:26] like a cloud of waves."
[28:30] So when a when a person is oppressed by
[28:32] the devil, it's like they're covered
[28:34] with a dark cloud
[28:36] and the cloud moves in like waves,
[28:38] right? So see, sometimes I'm happy,
[28:40] sometimes I'm down. It comes in and out,
[28:45] right?
[28:46] So if if we are oppressed, in other
[28:48] words, oppression is we're constantly
[28:50] losing the wrestling match. If we're
[28:52] oppressed, we got to say, "God, deliver
[28:54] me from this cloud over my life."
[28:57] &gt;&gt; And you've got to wrestle that cloud
[28:59] away.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do you wrestle with the
[29:02] word of God?
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm closing with this thought
[29:05] because I only got a couple minutes
[29:06] here. How much time on the live stream
[29:08] so far? 29 minutes. Oh my goodness. How
[29:12] is this possible?
[29:14] Hallelujah.
[29:18] I'm closing with this thought here.
[29:23] There will be no excuses
[29:26] for losing your wrestling match.
[29:29] Now, if you and I went to a wrestling
[29:31] match, there could be excuses somebody
[29:33] could lose. Like they got hurt, right?
[29:36] Let's see. They broke an ankle.
[29:39] That's why I lost.
[29:41] But church, in God's wrestling match,
[29:43] there's no excuses. Uh Romans 1 says
[29:46] there'll be no excuses, right? They are
[29:48] without excuse, the Bible says. So
[29:51] there'll be no excuses on the day of
[29:52] judgment. In other words, God doesn't
[29:55] send you out to wrestle injured.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; He sends you out to wrestle. You have
[30:00] perfect health and he gives you all six
[30:03] defenses and weapons that you need to do
[30:05] it.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; You just got to put them on.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:16] So let me share this here. This is the
[30:18] thought I want to bring.
[30:20] Beyond any shadow of doubt,
[30:24] you and I should win the wrestling match
[30:28] with evil spirits because we have been
[30:32] equipped to do so.
[30:36] And we are promised that we have greater
[30:38] power than any evil spirit that we will
[30:42] ever wrestle against.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:46] For time's sake. First John 4:4.
[30:53] Let's all read that. Ready? One, two,
[30:55] three. Ye are of God, little children,
[30:59] and have overcome them, because greater
[31:02] is he that is in you than he that's in
[31:06] the world. If if we're wrestling Satan
[31:09] today, none of us can say, "Well, God,
[31:11] you didn't make you didn't give me
[31:12] enough power to overcome." The Bible
[31:14] said, "Greater is he that's in you."
[31:17] Greater is the word that's within you
[31:19] than any other demon you could wrestle.
[31:21] Hallelujah.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:25] Hallelujah. Uh 1 Corinthians 10:13.
[31:32] 1 Corinthians 10:13. There is no
[31:34] temptation taken you, but with such is
[31:36] common to man. In other words, whatever
[31:38] you're wrestling with, someone's already
[31:39] wrestled it.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This ain't something new.
[31:45] Someone's already wrestled this.
[31:46] Someone's already overcame. So, you can
[31:48] overcome.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; And God is faithful. who will not suffer
[31:52] to be tempted above that you're able,
[31:54] but will with the temptation also make a
[31:56] way of escape that you may be able to
[31:58] bear it. In other words, God's never
[31:59] going to send an uh God's never going to
[32:02] let you wrestle an enemy you can't beat
[32:04] up.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; It'd be like Malachi. It'd be like
[32:07] Malachi taekwond do if they have like a
[32:09] little 10-year-old up against Malachi.
[32:10] Malachi's like 18 like
[32:14] But what would you say if Malachi got
[32:16] whipped by that little 10-year-old?
[32:19] You say you're an underachiever,
[32:22] right? How did this happen?
[32:25] Right? But we know Matt wouldn't happen
[32:27] to Malachi. He'd be like
[32:32] over.
[32:34] Oh, yeah. He'd go like this. Now, of
[32:35] course, he wouldn't do it to a child,
[32:36] but you understand the spiritual the
[32:38] spiritual symbol.
[32:41] So, other words, that that's what you
[32:42] and I when we wrestle the devil, that's
[32:44] what it's like. It's like Malachi
[32:47] against a little 10-year-old or
[32:48] something like that because greater is
[32:50] he that's in us. It's not us. It's God
[32:52] that's in us that's greater.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; God will not send you a wrestling match.
[32:56] You can't win. Hallelujah.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; And the only way that we lose is because
[33:03] we want to lose and we underachieved
[33:06] rather than achieving what we could have
[33:08] done. Hallelujah.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Everyone understand? Amen.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Uh John 10:28, this will encourage you.
[33:20] 28 and 29. John 10:28 29. This will
[33:22] bless you, I'm sure. And I give unto
[33:25] them, what does God give unto us?
[33:27] Eternal life. And they shall never
[33:29] perish, neither shall any man pluck them
[33:32] out of my hand. Is any is any wrestler
[33:36] ever going to be able to take you out of
[33:38] the the truth of God's word? No. It's
[33:40] impossible.
