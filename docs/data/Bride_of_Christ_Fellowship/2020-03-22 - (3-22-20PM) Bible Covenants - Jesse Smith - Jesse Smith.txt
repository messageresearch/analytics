[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but Stan will read our scripture here today we want to take the topic tonight of Bible covenant so we'll just do a little Bible study by the grace of the Lord now what I've done is for the Saints in our church that know I've been writing another book on the the 12 Bible mysteries and in the chapter two I'm looking at Israel and her blindness and so I'm showing how Israel's part of the Mosaic Covenant because she's rejected the New Covenant so that kind of got me studying on covenants and so we'll look at that here today by God's grace I think we'll start with the the seventh covenant so let's go to Jeremiah 31:31 we'll just start there for our text Jeremiah 31:31 since that's the covenant we're in right now I think I like to start there and then build up to that one by the grace of the Lord Jeremiah 31 verse 31 worried 31 to 34 by the grace of the Lord now I children run out we all read verse 30 31 and then I'll read the other ones but we'll just read one verse together so we're gonna read in verse 31 together then I'll just read 32 to 34 myself let's read verse 31 on three one two three behold the day's come saith the more that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah I'm going to keep reading myself not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my covenant they break although I was and husband unto them saith the Lord but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man and his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I'll remember their sin no more praise God let's have another word of Prayer here just briefly Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity Lord we can't or we don't feel led to gather tonight physically just just through this livestream Lord we're gathered in spirit we'd say so teach us from the Holy Spirit guide us lord help us today to understand our covenant more that we're under and the blessings and benefits of it dear God and we just thank you for all you've done or be magnified glorified protect your people Lord Jesus from this this awful sorrowful virus the coronavirus protect heal them and lord help us to come through Lord God with a great testimony of your love and your care your healing your provision your safety your protection and we give you all the glory tonight in Jesus Christ's name never said Amen god bless you is being seen in praise God so we're gonna start right there as far as our text but we'll go back and look at all the covenants I kind of want to just start with this Saints I'm writing this chapter I'm currently on this chapter the Israel's blindness chapter Paul calls it a mystery in Romans 11:25 I believe but to understand how God can how can God still save blinded Israel and so one of the aunt one of the reasons is because they're still under covenant blessings although they've turned down the New Covenant they they still are entitled to the of other Covenant blessings and so that's where this thought ID idea came from as far as studying the Bible covenants and so it's been a great study I've been working on it probably for a couple months now here just in the mornings for a few minutes each day Lord willing and we'd like to begin looking at this and I hope as I've done with the other chapters I hope as I preach it more inspiration or more clarification will come and it'll help Lord willing when the book is finished maybe another year so it could be just as solid as as possible to strengthen the people and to show them that the mysteries of God are finished by the grace of the Lord according to revelation 10 7 and that they're continuing to go around the world praise God so I like to preach off my notes I tried to print them off here I want to start with just some general statements on covenants Testaments and the Gentile dispensation so I want to start with those thoughts just to kind of lay a groundwork here for understanding the terminology of course terminology and understanding things is very important especially with the church ages and seven seals and now as you get into this with covenants it's very important as well to understand everything okay so understanding the covenants will help us understand how God particularly deals with Israel but then how God makes a gracious shift he goes from Israel just focusing on Israel to all mankind namely the Gentiles so it's wonderful to see God's love in the covenants and I believe church it is God's immutable power of his covenants which is his promises that allows even blinded Israelis to be safe think of that even those that are blinded by their own unbelief God can even save blinded Israelis and of course that's proven through the fifth seal Lord willing tonight I don't think I'll cover that too much but anyone that follows the message of William Branham will know that the fifth seal was all about Jews and how they're there right now the souls of faithful blinded Jews are under the altar in heaven and they're crying out oh Lord how long until our blood is Avenged on the earth and so they're crying out and the Lord will even answer them so we know blinded Jews do not go down to the grave as far as the heart of the earth or we'd say Hades why did Jews although blinded if they're faithful they are taken up to heaven by the grace of God so it's a it's a wonderful to see how God is so merciful and that's why I believe Church I can be wrong that's why I believe even foolish virgin I don't believe they'll go down to the heart of the earth I imagine if God has mercy on blinded Jews then God has mercy on foolish virgins who passed away and there there must be a place for them not gonna be wrong on that but that's just that's my opinion on the grace of God if God is gracious to blinded Jews I believe he would be gracious to foolish virgins because he is the god of all grace so I want to start with saying this the words covenant and Testaments are synonymous which means they mean the same thing and what they mean is a compact or a league so in the Old Testament the Old Testament only uses covenant in the King James a total of 256 times there's no uses of the word Testament in the Old Testament the first use is Matthew 26:28 and the New Testament uses both covenant and Testament 24 and 13 times respectively the same Greek word for covenant it's it's Daiya feekiee I think that's I say die of theek a which means a compact a covenant or Testament Testament is interpreted as both covenant and Testament repeatedly in the New Testament so the same Greek word in the New Testament can be used to say Testament or covenant and so that's why I believe covenant and Testament they're just inert interchangeable words so some people disagree they think they're different but from what I can see by studying the scripture and you know just their Greek origins it seems like they're one in the same here's a word that's often misunderstood I mentioned this a few weeks ago but the word dispensation I believe it's it's rarely understood because it's often confused with a covenant but I do not believe a dispensation is a covenant I believe in this sensation is a stewardship which in the Greek means I'm sorry that's what dispensation means in the Greek is a stewardship they can also mean an overseeing job so dispensation is a stewardship a job of overseeing a covenant is a compact or agreement so we can see some difference there okay the dispensation is a job but covenant is just an agreement so the Greek defines dispensation as a manager or overseer or stewardship so the Bible speaks of that we'll talk about that soon here the same word the same Greek word for dispensation is also used for stewardship in Jesus's parable of the unjust steward in Luke 16 1 to 13 so that's the parable well Jesus comes back and the steward or the steward was unjust and he quickly had to sell some things and try to save his own skin and that's where Jesus says the children of this world are wiser in their generation and the children of a faith of course that's just dealing with where Jesus saying you know Christians should make more investments in the things of God right we should make more investment we should take more time to invest in heavenly rewards that's basically what that means now you'll I've seen it on YouTube and you'll hear preachers preach it but some people say there's multiple dispensations throughout human history but I don't believe that idea is scriptural because I'm not I'm not defining a dispensation as a time period I'm defining dispensation as a stewardship the way the Greek defines it now the King James mentions the word dispensation four times and Paul is the only Bible writer from who uses it at all and will read those scriptures three of the verses point to one dispensation that belonged to Pau okay that's the dispensation of the gospel of Jesus Christ so why don't we read those so children can you read out loud would that be okay so Jeff your Bibles there okay so Lydia gave first Corinthians 9 17 that he's gonna read first Corinthians 9 17 Malachi Ephesians 1:10 that's okay you just have two readers so we have two readers in our house and then I'll tell you they go so we read all four scriptures that say dispensation in the King James so Lydia 1st Corinthians 9 17 okay so Paul says this stewardship or dispensation is committed specifically to him Lydia go to Colossians 1:25 while you're going there I'm gonna go to Melancon it okay so that was first Corinthians 9:7 now Malachi is gonna read Ephesians 1:10 so Malachi when you're in the fullness of times you might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him okay so this is the one time dispensation isn't used clearly just to refer to Paul it just says in the dispensation of the fullness of times and then maokai go to Ephesians 3 - can you read that bit fusions 3 - ÿà heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me even needs you work ok so again so Paul says in Ephesians 1:10 and I'm sorry I'm sorry feet yeah I'm sorry 1st Corinthians 9 17 and Ephesians 3 - that a dispensation of the gospel has been committed unto him then Lydia Colossians 1 25 wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the work to fill the Word of God alright so Paul says I have a dispensation to fulfill the Word of God so it seems like in those three verses there's one specific dispensation and that's given to Paul and it's the gospel that Jesus Christ committed to him now the one verse the dispensation of the fullness of times that word does seem to deal with when all time comes to an end we would say that would probably have to be at the New Jerusalem the future home when time comes to an end because there's time all the way up to that point so that's the difference now between covenants Testaments and dispensations that's the way it looks like the scripture teaches it covenant and Testament are agreements between God and man and then dispensation it seems like Paul had a dispensation of the gospel a stewardship committed to him that he had to be faithful in and we know he was faithful he said there's a crowd of life waiting for me praise God now let's go back to covenants now let's do a few scriptures here Paul literally uses the word covenants plural which means there's more than one so I'll read that Romans 9 for so if you have your Bibles you can turn there Romans 9 for and as you're turning there I want to say this my title for this is viable covenants now I want to say this I don't know if there are seven covenants or eight but to me it looks like eight but the reason it could be seven is because seven is a complete number and the rainbow rainbow rainbow represents a token of God's covenant and a rainbow has seven colors so it could be that there's seven covenants but I want to say the reason I think there's eight is because eight is the number of eternity brother branham use this in the future home and I'll go through some more examples as well the eighth day is the first day all over again so it points to the fact that life will just keep going time will just keep going on unending and the example he gives is brother Branham said God created the earth in six thousand years the seventh was interrupted by sin and so since God had 6,000 years God's given Satan 6,000 years to tempt the lie steal destroy kill but when Jesus returns and after the tribulation God gets his seventh day of rest the Millennium the 1,000 year millennium and then brother Ram says after the Millennium he said comes the eighth day or the future home or new Jerusalem so as I looked at the scripture and the quotes it seems to me there would be eight covenants because eight points to Eternity eight points to the future home by God's grace so but I could be wrong and I looked up quotes I couldn't find any quote where brother Branham says the exact number of covenants but I'll show you why I think there's eight of course through the scripture by God's grace I better set a timer I probably started it like four ten or something like that so just so that it's a little timer here all right so Romans nine four hopefully you're there by God's grace Romans nine four says who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises it was a great thing to be a Jew right look at all those blessings covenants lost service promises glory adoption what more could you ask for praise God there are so many great blessings I want you to again see Paul says there's more others plural there's multiple covenants go to Ephesians 2:12 if you have your Bibles that are Ephesians 2:12 now here Paul specifically calls them covenants of promise so that's why I think there's eight as well as you'll see every time God makes a promise or a league or a compact or agreement with man even beginning in Eden it seems it has to be classified as a covenant and so hopefully that will make sense by God's grace so Ephesians 2:12 okay every dance engine even then at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world know what a scripture what a beautiful scripture so really Paul says if you have no covenant with God you have no hope what an awful place to be in and Paul said that's where we were until the blood of Jesus Christ came amen thank God for the blood of Christ to come to us poor blinded aliens to the covenants Gentiles who were lost as brother Craig oi says Gentiles with clubs on our backs which brother branham said but always stinks in my mind because the being taught by Craig so how many covenants I think it's eight now here's why it seems God initiated eight covenants and granted them to mankind each covenant or compact established a new beginning for a group of people or a beginning and it's an expression of God's love grace and faithfulness because their promises right a promise of God would be a gracious thing it would be a faithful thing it would be a loving an act of love right because God doesn't have to make promises with us it is His grace and love now in the book when I did next is after that I showed biblical numerology and to show how a is a number that rep presents it can represent either new creation or a new beginning and I give a number of examples here let me just see one two three four five six seven eight I give nine examples okay so that's a lot of examples we're not gonna read them for times sake as far as in the Bible but you'll probably familiar with them if not then you know as you're listening this pause as you're listening to it later on the archive pause it and go back and read them but just write them down so if you're listening live just write down down if you want to go study them out and search them out I find though in this age I'm not sure how many people actually go study out everything they write down I know it's good that reason I say that's cuz it's a struggle for me now I study everyday but when I actually take specific notes on sermons I don't always find myself going back over those so I want to encourage you to do that by the grace of the Lord as you feel led by the Holy Spirit so let's look at these nine examples how eight represents either new creation or new beginning okay the first one is God saved eight souls by water during Noah's Flood and he gave humanity a new beginning that's Genesis 818 and first Peter 3:20 very familiar with that he saved eight so he starts all over humanity gets a second a second beginning with eight people number two every Hebrew male was circumcised on the eighth day which seems to represent males getting a beginning part of Abraham's covenant so if they weren't circumcised they'd be cut off from the people of Israel so they had to be had to be circumcised in order to have a beginning time in the Covenant and it came on the eighth day the third example is that God officially forgave in through sacrificial atonement and gave them a new beginning as the glory of the Lord fell on the eighth day of sacrificing okay so when God established his covenant it was on the eighth day that the glory fell so it seemed to give them a new beginning the people of God and they were declared as having the atonement at that point I was Leviticus 9 the whole chapter 1 to 24 live in against 9 1 to 24 now Leviticus 14 it kind of deals with this morning's message with the coronavirus a leper was declared clean at the door of the congregation on the eighth day of their recovery which was like beginning a new time of cleanliness right on the eighth days on the eighth day they're declared new here's a fifth example Israel held a holy convocation or sacred assembly assembly as an extra Sabbath the Sabbath day on the eighth day of the Feast of Trumpets to mark the beginning of the civil year okay and that's actually the example brother Branham uses in the future home to show how the eighth can be the number of eternity or a new beginning that's leviticus 23 verses 33 to 44 so there was an extra convocation an extra Sabbath day on the eighth day praise God marking the beginning of the civil year because the religious year you know there's there was two years there was religious year started in April usually April sometimes March with Passover and went all the way till Feast of the trumpets and then they had that they called it the civil year all right the next example is David was the youngest and eighth son he was chosen by God as a man after God's own heart to give Israel a new beginning after King Saul's failure so we see he was the eighth son God chose the eighth son of Jesse and that's First Samuel 1314 and the part ways after the heart of God is 16 chapter 16 10 and 11 alright next one in acts 933 the paralyzed Aeneas I think that's how you say it was healed by Peter in the eighth year of his infirmity as a new beginning of sound health so he got sound health in that eighth year in Philippians 4:8 Paulus eight things to meditate upon in order to renew your mind so yeah I don't know if you remember that one that was a real blessing there's eight things there to meditate the things that are holy things that are good of good report all those examples there 8 why list 8 because it renews your mind makes it new again and here's the ninth and final one now there was more of course but these were the these were the most clear ones I could show through Scripture and I wanted to put in in the text of the book okay so the next one is found in 2nd Peter chapter 1 the statue perfect man verses 5 to 7 second Peter 1:5 to 7 charity is the eighth and final attribute in the stature of a perfect man and that makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus praise God that's according to second Corinthians 5:17 any man that's in Christ is a new creature and so there starts with faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then eighth is charity so charity makes you brand new praise God of course as eternal life as well so that's another one for eternity praise God now I 1 give a reference here because there's been a lot of critics of brother Branham who said he didn't a reference where he got his works and you know sometimes he didn't but I don't think it was really necessary he wasn't trying to copyright anything and make money off anybody but I'm in a credit clearance Larkin at this point because I looked up covenants in his book and his book is called dispensational truce now of course I I see things a little differently he has seven covenants I believe there's eight just after looking at Scripture and what a covenant means as a compact agreement between God and man and some of these scriptures I got from Clarence Larkins work so I won eight and I give reference in the book to clarence Larkins work but I don't just like brother Branham I didn't agree with everything that he said so as we look at now we'll take a few minutes here as we look at these eight covenants we'll discover when they were initiated their individual commands and their conditions and when they end there's only one that doesn't end I'm sure you know which one it is it's the last one praise God the eternal covenant is what I call it the eternal covenant the new heavens and a new earth praise God so all the other ones are either end or get interrupted but that's the only one I believe that that we would say doesn't end now though as I think about that I start getting other thoughts so some of these things could be subject to change because I think about Abraham's covenant you know being blessed you know through Jesus Christ and so forth so I think of the day David covenant or Davidic I think they call it Davidic covenant how the son of David would sit on the throne without end so that could be an unending covenant as well so bear with me as I meditate on these and just seek the leadership of the Holy Spirit and then some of the covenants had unique signs as we'll see as well also called tokens praise God tokens so I think Lord willing I'll just you know kind of read through my notes here and maybe we'll stop from time to time too to read a few scriptures if my readers could help us out by God's grace okay so the first covenant I believe is the Eden covenant now there's another way to say it add Enoch I'm not sure if that's how you say identic I'm not sure how it's said but there's the covenant from the Garden of Eden and this of course was found in Genesis 1 verses 26 to 30 in Genesis chapter 2 verses 15 to 25 so any scriptures that deal with God giving promises and conditions and maybe signs all those scriptures have to be combined to be his commands for that specific covenant so God initiated this covenant from him down to Adam and Eve and this was before sin of course and her humanity these unclothed humans Adam and Eve lived in complete innocence and obedience and then God gave them these gracious commands he said be fruitful and multiply of course they hadn't yet right that's where Satan came in and injected his the seed of discrepancy into the human race but he they had the commands to reproduce fill the earth with people subdue the earth keep the garden and have dominion over fish birds and all living creatures and part of it man animal were limited to a veg vegetable diet or vegetarian diet that was part of it at the beginning now there was this covenant only had one condition children that's something there's just one condition God only asked him to do one thing of course if any of us would have been in that same situation we would have done it but God made this first covenant so simple just keep one command but we know God had to do it so he could manifest that he was a savior that he was a healer he had all these attributes of love and Savior Redeemer healer and he wanted to manifest all these attributes so he he and his foreknowledge knew they'd fall any of us would have fallen but it just shows humanity's nature their weakness they couldn't even keep one command so their one condition for the Covenant was abstinence from eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil now in this book chapter 9 I'll go over the true identity of the forbidden fruit because that's the chapter on the mystery of iniquity which we know is Satan just like the mystery of godliness is a person Jesus Christ the mystery of iniquity is in the person of Satan which his spirit of course is the spirit of Antichrist and but through the mystery of iniquity we can see the person of it how it starts in Satan in heaven war in heaven and then come down to earth and then we can see how iniquity started in the Garden of Eden right through Satan possessing the serpent and then causing injecting his seed into the human race and so that will all be tied together so I think it's just a God's Word is so beautiful praise God that mysteries of God must be finished praise God and also in that chapter they'll see the secret of the true identity the forbidden fruit and the true identity of the two trees the Tree of Life and the tree of knowledge and good and evil as long as Adam Eve kept his condition eternal life and peace was theirs and they would keep it within their bodies they would have eternal life within their bodies if they just kept that one condition of the Covenant but we know Eve was beguiled which means deceived by the serpent and she ate the forbidden fruit and then Adam Lee Adam willingly sinned so even she was a little deceived on it but then Adam knew what he was doing he partook of the forbidden fruit and he plunged all humanity into sin slavery because let's read the second Peter 2nd Peter 2:19 so there was already some condition you know we know there was the Word of God is forever settled in heaven right so all God's Word was already written in heaven and so Lydia if you read 2nd Peter 2:19 there was a Unruh there was a law there I don't know if it's written or not but there had to been a law that if a man is overcome then he becomes a slave to that man so let me go ahead Superman is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage amen so hopefully you can hear that but God had given Adam all this power and Dominion but then the Bible said four of whom a man is overcome of the same he's brought into bondage so when Adam willingly sinned he became a slave slay a sin slave to the devil right and then sin comes in our members then the sin nature begins in our members that's why Paul calls Satan the god of this world in 2nd Corinthians 4:4 because this is the moment that he took that title Satan deceived Eve and then through that Adam willingly gave in trusting God to make a way for his wife to be redeemed because she was part of him so he took the sin on out of his love right just like we know as a pre figure of Christ Christ took upon our sin that we can be saved and were his wife by God's grace amen so there was that unwritten law of whom a man is overcome he's brought into bondage and so Adam became a sin slave Adam and Eve and all their descendants down to us are slaves to sin so much so that Paul a Holy Ghost field man says the things that I don't things that I hate are the things I do a wretched man that I am right but thanks be to God who gives us victory to the Lord Jesus Christ so we fall in sin but we should have remained there we have because we have power to overcome the sin through repentance through the atonement of Jesus's blood right and a renewed mind praise God now finishing up on this first covenant looks like I probably won't get to all eight tonight so maybe then or really maybe next Sunday we'll get to some of them well by the grace of God so after Adam breaks God's covenant because he knew what he was doing the blessing of eternal life inside their bodies came to an end and death began to set in didn't it wasn't right away because Adam lived over 900 years and then God because of their disobedience he has to dry them can you imagine you're driving your own children out of your presence God had to do that because they broke his covenant he's a holy God right and now their unholy their defile they chose to do that so he has to dry them out and he even sets cherubims even sorry yeah he says chairman's was flaming swords to keep mankind from accessing the Tree of Life now God just did that because he again he wanted to display his love and mercy through all of human history he had a great plan praise God the Bible said God hid it from ages and from generations Christ in us the hope of glory praise God now what's interesting is though even though Adam and Eve fell and Adam particularly plunged all of humanity into sin there are still some commands that remain so the command to do stay the same the command to subdue the earth and have dominion over all living things remained as well because we see Adam and Eve and their descendants doing that after the fall and it says it seems these covenant commands continue unending throughout all covenants including the eternal covenant because the eighth mirrors the sinless condition of the first okay so what I mean by that is that this seems like there may be reproduction in the in the future home but it would be by spoken word there's no doubt going to be subduing the earth during the future home and there's going to be dominion of mankind over everything else even in the future home will take dominion over it so I might see my statements if I'm saying anything wrong please pardon me I'm trying to grow and understand these I've never preached on these these is the first time I've actually preaching on covenants and remember as brother man taught us the future home is God returning mankind to that Eden condition praise God that's why some of these commands will remain unchanged they just may differ a little bit so the only difference is the eternal covenant has no conditions since Satan and sin are finally annihilated praise God amen so the Eden covenant had conditions but the few the eternal covenant the future home I don't believe there's any conditions because the sin will be done away with will have perfect bodies there'll be no temperature praise God there we know Satan to deceive or caused to stumble you won't be overcome by anything except you'll be overcome with Jesus's love praise God hallelujah be a love slave to Christ for all eternity praise God all right let's go about more minutes here that way I'll just teach you bow to our soul or running with to the second covenant and then we'll then everybody have a restful evening and you can think on the covenants right you're gonna chew on this and ruminate on this think on this hopefully through the night by God's grace so the second covenant is called the Adam covenant or Adamic I'm not sure how to say it Adamek I'm not sure how to say it is the Adamek covenant and this was found in Genesis 3 14 to 24 we kind of mentioned this earlier at the end of the other covenant now this covenant is initiated by God again so see God initiated the first one with Adam and Eve he created them and gave them a covenant this one he initiate Segen and he does it with animal sacrifice as you're gonna see most of the covenants this is where it gets a little strange but most of the covenants starting with Adam have blood because an agreement has to be made and so God's way he does he the way God makes an agreement is he tears a part of sacrifice and he has to give an innocent substitute something has to die at the time of an agreement now the reason I said it can be strange is because I can't find any blood shed for David's covenant so children and Saints let me know if you find one I've searched it we'll get to that maybe next week but Nathan gave a covenant to David that his seed and and his seed would have a king on their throne forever but I can't find where God ever instituted that covenant with with a blood sacrifice but all the other ones do except for the last one right the eternal covenant wouldn't need it there's no more sin there's there's no more atonement needed because we already have perfect Laura five bodies say he's done away with that's that's where there may be one thing that's a little strange maybe doesn't meet the same pattern of bloodshed when covenants are given so the second covenant is Adam's covenant it's initiated God initiates it with his own blood sacrifice because the Bible said God made coats of skins to cover Adam and Eve's newly discovered nakedness right because before they were naked and didn't bother them they weren't aware of it but now they've sinned now they know they cover their private parts their loins we cover that through the scripture and so God has to initiate a covenant with them and here Adam and his offspring learn without shedding a blood there's no what there's no remission of sins and forgiveness and that's actually from Hebrews 9:22 so Adam and Eve especially Adam no doubt and then later Abel they had a must at all Abel later they have to learn without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins Adam Eve must have felt sinful but then they see God kill lambs probably to make them coats of skins and God says I've you must have said I've forgiven you I put away your sins and so this would have been done by faith because the Bible says by faith Adam and Abel and their godly offspring understood how to offer offerings and gifts unto God and that's in Hebrews 11 verse 4 the Bible said by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain so by faith by revelation God revealed to Adam and then to Abel that there's no remission of sins except 5 except for self-sacrifice this is part of the second covenant now in this covenant God commanded curses and consequences for the Serpent's beguiling and also Adam and Eve's disobedience the serpent is cursed above all cattle beasts forced to go upon his belly and eat dust so before he wasn't on his belly he wasn't eating dust so note the serpent was upright standing creature before the curse now while speaking to the serpent in genesis 3:15 God places enmity or hatred between the woman and the serpent and their separate offsprings God actually caused them offsprings and now most importantly though God makes a promise he makes a beautiful promise praise God he declares the first prophecy of the cross of Jesus Christ four thousand years in advance praise God and he promises that a member of Eve seed would bruise the Serpent's head while the serpent would bruise his heel Jesus indeed began to destroy the works of the devil and his resurrection was a public triumph over every demon foe praise God hallelujah that's how he began bruising the Serpent's head but don't but let's not forget Paul told the Corinthians Satan will I'm sorry Satan will be bruised shortly under your feet so that's why I children that you still have you and I we still have opportunities to bruise the devil now in order to cast out evil spirits right and overcoming evil spirits so we see Jesus on the cross started bruising right he bruised his head and now we can get victories and we can bruise we can put Satan under our feet as well by God's grace so what a beautiful promise Jesus fulfills on the cross he fulfills God's promise from the second covenant now of course as time goes on this genesis 3:15 prophecy is expounded upon and fulfilled through for future covenants Abraham Moses David and then the new covenant okay so this this this prophecy keeps getting more and more information praise God and then till Jesus fulfills it or implements it through the New Testament he said the New Covenant in my praise God now notice Eve is not cursed but her consequences are multiplied sorrow in conception and bringing forth children remember the punishment has to fit the crime so Eve had to do something immoral right intimately immoral of course we know that was adultery with the serpent because that's that was the sin and then the consequence was multiplied sorrow in conception and childbearing additionally God says her desire or longing is to be for her husband which means previously her desire was for someone other than her husband which was the serpent her last consequence is her husband will rule over her meaning Adam is the leader in their marriage and she's under submission to him as taught in the New Testament as well you'll find that first Corinthians 11:3 in Ephesians 5:22 2:24 almost done here by God's grace notice like Eve Adam is not cursed but the ground is cursed for his sake Adam would bring forth food through sorrowful sweaty hard work battling thorns and thistles that was his consequence but he himself wasn't cursed you know God cannot curse his own children now seems like all conditions and commands from this covenant remain to this day God's promise to send Christ to bruise the Serpent's head is the ultimate expression of love to us so right after the very first sin God chose his greatest expression he says I won't send someone else's I don't send someone else he said but out come or I'll send my son through the woman's seed and I will pay the penalty for all the sins of the world and this is spoken of in Romans 5:8 which says but God commendeth or proofs his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us praise God so God in this bathroom after the first most this awful sin here God makes the most glorious promise he says my love will bring you back right yet to drive out his children we said remember I'll bring you back praise God I'll bring you back to Eden hallelujah through my son Jesus Christ hallelujah thank God amen and drive him out every time I let you back in hallelujah thank God for His mercy and His grace in closing the Adamic or Adam covenant is fulfilled and it ends when the eternal covenant begins now here's why I believe this it is fulfilled and ends when the future home begins because it seems the inhabitants of the earth during the Millennium still be farming I don't know if they'll be sweating now actually they would be sweating because they don't have eternal they don't have glorified bodies like we'll have I'm just talking about the inhabitants of the world that's right so there will be human inhabitants on the earth during the Millennium who was still far remember they're going to change their swords into plowshares I believe the scripture says a couple of times and they're still gonna be working the land that's according to Isaiah 65 21 and Micah 4 verses 3 & 4 so this this Adam covenant still goes on all the way through the Millennium and also it still scenes there's going to be death in the Millennium - and that's from two scriptures Isaiah 65 20 the Bible says a child may die a hundred years old remembers looking a thousand year millennial period and then also we know there's going to be death in the linen because at the end of it Satan deceives all habitants of the earth right that aren't saved and they come up against the holy city and God has the save by sending down fire and destroys all those that come against the Jerusalem they're the Millennial temple the Jewish temple in Israel so see Church it's a great exercise I'm being I'm being challenged by the Holy Spirit not getting complacent I'm going into things I've never taught before now I'm trusting in the gift of the Holy Spirit to help me rightly divide the word of truth to you to me to all of us and we rejoice in God's covenant praise God so musician Malachi if you'll come let's let's close with a song we'll do one wonders two songs maybe then we'll finish up here by God's grace hope everybody can say Amen

any blessing but thank God we have the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord this one look on this blessing here God told Moses and you're familiar with the God told Moses to speak of the Aaron on how to bless the children of Israel this was under the Mosaic Covenant Numbers chapter 6 he said the Lord bless thee member there's six blessings Lord bless thee and keep thee make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace praise God they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I would bless them holiday aren't you glad for God's promises Oh mine thank you Lord this is just my desire we now know this is through the Holy Spirit through the blood of Jesus Christ were blessed and kept on the face of God is the presence of
