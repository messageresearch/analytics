[28:45] one by one they chose to die the son of

[30:29] final day let us proudly stand and
[30:35] boldly say aye
[30:40] I will give all of our legions to
[31:43] teasers amen
[31:45] hey let's take our Bibles here this
[31:48] evening by God's grace I'd like to go
[31:50] back to that series on worship and I'd
[31:54] like to look at focus on shewbread I'm
[31:56] just gonna call it holy place I'm just
[31:57] gonna let's look at part five of worship
[31:59] and I just want to look at the holy
[32:01] place so we'll read one just one portion
[32:04] of Scripture let me go there here aside
[32:08] about my notes like to go to let's go to
[32:11] Exodus 25 verse 30 let's just read that
[32:14] by the grace of God Exodus 25 30 and
[32:17] this thought was kind of quickened to me
[32:18] I preached this out in Iowa a little bit
[32:21] different thoughts were kind of
[32:22] quickened to me out there and I had one
[32:25] brother call one of the sermons he said
[32:26] that was monumental he told me I said
[32:29] well there's no way I could preach a
[32:30] monumental sermon it had to been Jesus
[32:32] because there's no good thing about me
[32:34] under that Jesus says apart from me you
[32:37] can do nothing and then other people
[32:40] came up and said you know it was just
[32:41] God talking directly to them so very
[32:44] thankful for that we all want God to
[32:47] talk to us don't we you don't want to
[32:48] say Lord Here I am
[32:50] speak to me send me Exodus 20:5 please
[32:58] so I want to focus like I said on the
[33:00] holy place I'll probably spend most of
[33:02] my time tonight on the shewbread I've
[33:04] never really preached on the shewbread
[33:05] before so I've been doing some studies
[33:07] on that over the weekend and this
[33:09] morning and I want to preach on that
[33:12] this morning by God's grace X is 25
[33:17] verse 30 we'll just read that one verse
[33:21] X is 25 verse 34 there say Amen let's
[33:24] read that together on three one two
[33:26] three and thou shalt set upon the table
[33:29] shewbread before me always amen
[33:34] so God is asking them as priests that
[33:38] they have to always have shewbread
[33:40] laying before God in the holy place and
[33:44] as we'll see it was their responsibility
[33:46] to make sure the shewbread was there and
[33:49] it was laid before God Amen thank God
[33:52] for that
[33:52] now how many know it which day they ate
[33:54] the shewbread on as they might know the
[33:57] Sabbath it's on the day of rest on their
[34:00] day of rest they got to enjoy the
[34:01] shewbread how we know the Bible said
[34:05] that we've entered into our rest
[34:07] praise the Lord when do we eat our
[34:09] shewbread when we enter our Sabbath
[34:11] resting from our works and Christ in us
[34:14] Christ living in us the hope of glory
[34:17] that's that word of Prayer let's just
[34:18] bow our heads here if you have need on
[34:20] your heart again maybe for this service
[34:21] let's make it known to the Lord by
[34:23] raising up hand father my hands are up
[34:25] Lord we love you again we worship you we
[34:27] love you not just with words but with
[34:30] our lives
[34:30] Lord God our lives say I love you our
[34:33] our words that we speak say I love you
[34:36] our work that we do in home or on the
[34:39] job our work says I love you we love you
[34:42] tonight Lord speak to us through this
[34:44] thy holy word Lord God and I pray you be
[34:47] glorified here and all that said and
[34:49] done father use me as your vessel Lord

[34:55] Lord apart from you I can do nothing so
[34:58] help me tonight help your people tonight
[35:00] and speak to us through thy word in
[35:01] Jesus Christ's name never I said amen
[35:05] god bless you B&C the praise the Lord
[35:08] so this Sunday Lord willing uh it was my
[35:11] desire to preach kind of what I preached
[35:14] on the the Sunday morning there in Iowa
[35:17] I just caught it and I don't remember
[35:20] this
[35:21] I caught it from the red heifer they
[35:23] were there when I preached the red
[35:23] heifer over and that that was back in
[35:25] 2015-2016 I think I want to preach a
[35:29] message Sunday called from the red
[35:30] heifer to the Holies of Holies so and
[35:34] that's what like I said brought a lot of
[35:35] people you know to the altar so well
[35:37] could we do some slides here I just want
[35:40] to show some visuals I kind of want to
[35:42] review some of these thoughts I was like
[35:46] I said I wasn't really planning on this
[35:47] it just kind of came up and we remember
[35:52] the tabernacle Moses you know on Sunday
[35:54] I want to just show the believers
[35:56] journey through this again and I want to
[35:58] bring it the way we brought it last year
[36:00] and I've never preached this thought
[36:02] this way before but I want to preach it
[36:04] from the red heifer all the way to the
[36:06] Holies of Holies and I think I'll use
[36:09] that this Sunday by God's grace so
[36:11] remember that with the tabernacle Moses
[36:14] you know you had brother Simon was here
[36:17] had some good visuals too
[36:18] you had all the the tribes of God camped
[36:20] around the tabernacle of God this was
[36:24] God's dwelling place and God always
[36:26] likes to dwell right in the middle
[36:27] praise God
[36:28] God likes to be right in the middle of
[36:30] your life how many thankful for that not
[36:32] only does he want to be in the middle of
[36:33] your life he wants to be in the middle
[36:34] of your soul praise God the middle of
[36:36] your being so that's what you know God's
[36:38] tabernacle is likened to today the Bible
[36:40] said your whole spirit soul and body
[36:42] I remember just as there's three courts
[36:45] here you have the outer court you know
[36:47] this this Tabernacle was a type of the
[36:50] human body and so we have the body of
[36:52] man and you have the temple the
[36:54] Tabernacle Moses I didn't know I had all
[36:56] these slides on here actually wasn't
[36:57] planning on doing all this this is kind
[36:59] of surprising to me so this outer court
[37:01] represents the body and of course you
[37:03] have the outer court of the man the
[37:05] spirit of man is the mind and that
[37:07] represents the holy place so tonight
[37:09] we're going to spend some time looking
[37:11] at the holy place again that's the human
[37:13] spirit of the individual but then inside
[37:17] of the inside we know after the human
[37:19] spirit
[37:20] there's
[37:20] soul inside of that human spirit and the
[37:23] prophets that is actually located in
[37:24] your physical heart there's a hole in
[37:26] your heart and that's where the soul is
[37:28] in the physical heart of man and so you
[37:32] have the soul of man which is a type of
[37:34] the Holies of Holies okay now I got all
[37:37] these scriptures this is an old slide I
[37:39] so I want to tonight I just wanted to
[37:42] kind of look at this here as we look at
[37:43] just the tabernacle itself you know you
[37:45] have the gate the brazen altar the Laver
[37:47] the holy place and the Holies of Holies
[37:50] I want to spend most of my time in the
[37:52] Holy in the holy place I just another
[37:55] visual I'm gonna skip past that one I
[37:57] just remember this remember you had your
[37:59] tribes on all four sides
[38:02] you have Judah on the east you have
[38:04] Reuben on the south Dan on the north and
[38:06] then ephraim on the west and everybody
[38:08] had a banner right everybody had a flag
[38:10] praise God and Dan was flying the Eagle
[38:13] anointing praise God that's type to us
[38:15] today on the north side we know we have
[38:17] there under the eagle anointing for this
[38:19] day and the Eagles likened to a prophet
[38:22] because the Bible said that God brought
[38:24] Israel out of Egypt on the wings of
[38:27] eagles how do you do it by Moses and
[38:29] Aaron all right the Bible in one place
[38:31] has Moses Aaron and Miriam
[38:33] so God puts you know his sister and her
[38:36] her ministry in there too but we know it
[38:39] was Moses that a prophet that God
[38:41] brought him out on pardon me I don't
[38:47] know how I can mess this up I hope I
[38:50] don't mess it up now the outer core I
[38:52] love this this is what I think it really
[38:55] helped us on Sunday when we preached on
[38:56] this the outer court and now this is not
[39:00] and I'm not gonna do the the red heifer
[39:01] this the tonight I'll do wait for that
[39:03] for Sunday but once you got in the first
[39:06] thing you would experience was a real
[39:08] genuine death if you want to worship God
[39:12] how many wanna be close to God I
[39:14] remember this is a type of the New
[39:16] Testament if any believer wants to be a
[39:19] king or priest today the very first
[39:21] thing we need is a real death that
[39:23] animal couldn't just be cut and bled you
[39:26] know it had to literally die and now how
[39:29] many of us not wait let's be honest you
[39:31] know with everybody we know that goes to
[39:33] church all of our family friends no
[39:34] matter what
[39:34] Church how many go to church ready to
[39:37] die out and I mean really die how many
[39:40] really take that attitude well I want to
[39:42] go and I know I'm gonna leave that at
[39:44] the altar today how many people but Adam
[39:47] well how many shaking his head like
[39:48] that's what I do too
[39:49] how many people most people don't they
[39:51] go there to hear a nice make you laugh
[39:53] you know or to make you cry or but most
[39:56] people don't really want to experience
[39:58] death they don't want to let go maybe
[40:01] they'll let go of some things but but
[40:03] they got to keep that one lingering sin
[40:06] that's actually hindering their race
[40:07] it's hindering their spiritual run but
[40:11] God was showing here the very first
[40:13] thing once you actually get into worship
[40:15] you've got to die you you can't let this
[40:19] live something has to die guess what in
[40:22] the New Testament now you're the living
[40:24] sacrifice once you went in here yeah the
[40:26] first time you went in yes you have to
[40:27] recognize Jesus Christ but after this if
[40:30] you want to get back in if you want to
[40:32] come back and worship now you're the one
[40:33] that's got to die right is that true
[40:36] that's right because we're in a show
[40:38] with the red heifer when somebody was
[40:40] unclean they were cut off from the
[40:41] church how would you like it if well I
[40:45] mean this is way it ought to be but how
[40:46] would you like it if there was some
[40:48] machine we could hook up right when you
[40:49] walked in the door and it told us if you
[40:51] were clean or unclean I guess I liked
[40:53] that that that's how it wasn't the Old
[40:56] Testament if you were unclean you
[40:59] couldn't even get to the death part
[41:00] because you got to get clean first
[41:02] then you're ready to die raise god you
[41:06] got to get rid of what you know is wrong
[41:08] what you know is sinful you've got to
[41:10] get rid of that first and get clean get
[41:13] wash in the waters of the word then you
[41:15] can now come into the worship of God and
[41:17] you can really experience a real death
[41:21] hallelujah that's right
[41:23] and then you know after the death after
[41:26] you know suffering and experiencing the
[41:28] pain of death with worship then you
[41:31] would go to the brazen and I got these
[41:34] mixed up so I just go back here here's
[41:35] the brazen altar so I got these my order
[41:38] mixed up here because remember all that
[41:42] all the sacrifice that had to be
[41:44] examined outside of the camp I'm sorry
[41:45] outside of the gate rather not the camp
[41:47] outside of the gate
[41:48] they're to be examined out there the
[41:50] priests had to examine it make sure
[41:51] there's a good lamb or or Turtledove or
[41:53] whatever they were bringing and then it
[41:55] had to die right there on the brazen
[41:57] altar now after that you know with many
[41:59] of the offerings with the meat offering
[42:00] or meat offering that was actually a
[42:03] bread but with the burnt offering and
[42:05] sin offering some of the other offerings
[42:07] that they had to be cut how many know
[42:08] that they had to be rightly divided and
[42:11] then in Leviticus 1:9 for sin offering
[42:14] the sin offering had to be rightly
[42:16] divided and then you had to take the
[42:18] inward parts different parts and you had
[42:20] to wash them in water
[42:22] amen like that so the very insides of
[42:25] the sacrifice had to be washed before
[42:28] they were presented to God amen does
[42:31] that sound familiar we've got a coconut
[42:33] listen we've got to come to God Church
[42:34] now I'm challenging you and I'm
[42:36] challenging me we've got to come to
[42:37] church and worship and we got to be
[42:39] willing to die out and then after you
[42:42] die out now God can wash your inward
[42:44] parts and that's the literal word in
[42:48] that Leviticus 1:9 they'll wash the
[42:50] inward parts after you is it present
[42:53] yourself Lord I know you're my sacrifice
[42:55] but now I'm coming help me to be a
[42:57] living sacrifice
[42:58] Lord cut cut things out of my life
[43:01] praise God
[43:02] separate me from any any wrong you know
[43:05] separate me from anything and Lord wash
[43:08] my inward parts praise God that I can be
[43:11] clean amen
[43:12] wash me and let me be up for let me be
[43:15] an acceptable sacrifice member we ought
[43:17] to live worthy of the vocation where
[43:20] we're in we're called amen and so see do
[43:24] most people come like that really ready
[43:26] to die I would probably say no most
[43:28] people most church members I don't care
[43:30] if you call yourself Methodist or
[43:31] Pentecostal most people really don't
[43:33] come here to die because if something
[43:35] died you'd see it right you'd hear it if
[43:39] something really died you'd hear you'd
[43:42] realize it my something just died so we
[43:45] got to be we got to be aware of this so
[43:47] we got to make sure we examine our
[43:49] worship how many one examine their
[43:50] worship that's where this little series
[43:52] you know I just kind of fell inspired
[43:53] with faith comes by hearing and you can
[43:55] never overemphasize revelation some of
[43:58] these different quotes you know we
[43:59] brought out about a worship you know
[44:02] just felt led to go into this for
[44:03] worship just remind us this was true
[44:05] worship something has to die in order to
[44:09] worship and that's why I church when
[44:11] you're tired and you don't want to raise
[44:13] your hands but you do guess what
[44:14] happened your will just died or you're
[44:17] tired and your feet hurt and you'd
[44:19] rather stay at home and not come to
[44:20] church and brother Jesse says let's
[44:22] stand to our feet and you're like no I
[44:23] have to but your will dies something
[44:26] died amen
[44:27] now you're worshiping praise God but see
[44:30] if we let the sinful nature and we don't
[44:33] really sacrifice for God are we really
[44:35] worshiping because we must worship in
[44:37] spirit and in truth praise God you see
[44:40] it's got to be it's something has to die
[44:42] or will our desires our plans our
[44:46] reluctance our tiredness our fearfulness
[44:49] our greed our desires whatever it is
[44:52] something has to die if we're really
[44:55] going to worship Jesus amen he requires
[44:57] it remember what Paul said as he died I
[45:00] die every Sunday is that what Paul said
[45:02] I die on Sunday and Wednesday is that
[45:05] what the scripture says what's it say I
[45:08] die what daily we die think we got a
[45:11] practice dying every day amen hallelujah
[45:15] where I'm not going to think those
[45:17] thoughts anymore Lord take those
[45:19] thoughts from me so I can think your
[45:21] thoughts amen let me die to this habit
[45:25] I've been writing this habit so this I'm
[45:27] sorry this habits been riding me so long
[45:29] like brother Graham said this dark
[45:31] clouds been hanging over me too long
[45:32] help me to die out to this dark cloud
[45:34] amen
[45:36] I cannot give God a worship unless
[45:39] something dies something has to some
[45:41] attitude or some belief or some state of
[45:44] mind or some sin or some desire it has
[45:47] to die now you're worshiping a Manny and
[45:51] then you say wash me Lord cleanse me
[45:54] wash me in the waters of the word now
[45:58] let's work our way in here I want to
[45:59] spend the most amount of time what I
[46:00] plan to do tonight by God's grace I just
[46:02] want to review the candlestick real
[46:04] quick because we've been preaching on
[46:07] the 7 church ages I don't know if you've
[46:10] known this when the last year I've been
[46:12] preaching on the church ages we've been
[46:15] enjoying all the
[46:16] beautiful light right inside the holy
[46:18] place I don't know if you knew that or
[46:19] not but that's what we've been doing
[46:21] it's like we as priests and kings
[46:24] through this sermon series that brother
[46:26] Branham preached remember he said it
[46:27] wasn't optional he said it was what
[46:28] necessary he said I wouldn't waste your
[46:31] time and bring you to church eight
[46:33] nights in a row if I didn't feel it was
[46:35] necessary to know these things this is
[46:38] necessary and so the Holy Ghost has
[46:40] directives in here all these months is
[46:42] last year we've been lucky with our
[46:44] Laodicea and we went back to Ephesus and
[46:47] worked our way up now we're at
[46:48] Philadelphia we're almost done we got a
[46:49] few prime or a few more sermons on that
[46:51] but we have been standing in the glory
[46:54] and the illumination of the seven golden
[46:57] candlesticks amen
[46:58] seeing all these beautiful things as
[47:00] beautiful lights of the messengers just
[47:03] enjoying the radiance of the light of
[47:06] God amen hallelujah that's what we've
[47:09] been enjoying amen for those of us
[47:11] enjoying the Word of God and I'm one of
[47:13] those praise the Lord Amen hallelujah
[47:16] like I said there's been many things in
[47:17] the word in the church ages that have
[47:19] been a blessing to me and have really
[47:21] helped me in an hour when I needed them
[47:23] I needed these thoughts I needed these
[47:25] revelations and they came at the very
[47:27] hour I needed them amen now let's step
[47:32] in here no heed something died here
[47:35] hopefully tonight something died
[47:38] hopefully were washed you know through
[47:41] worshiping the word now we would step in
[47:44] here to the holy place now
[47:47] it was really kind of dramatizing it in
[47:49] Iowa was really kind of just exciting
[47:51] for me I've never really thought about
[47:52] like that but I was I was preaching on
[47:54] this really hard about dying out to sins
[47:56] and things and then I just kind of I
[47:58] kind of pretended I was like the priest
[48:00] and can you imagine we're the priests
[48:01] going in here and you pull back the veil
[48:04] and what's the first thing you would see
[48:07] light right there there's no windows so
[48:11] it wouldn't be natural light it'd be
[48:13] this special holy light hey man and
[48:16] anybody that tried to copy that light
[48:19] God would cut him off because there was
[48:22] one light that they were supposed to
[48:23] have we can worship under one light amen
[48:26] not the light of another age we worship
[48:29] under God's whole
[48:30] spirit light the light for this hour so
[48:33] can you imagine church as we dramatize
[48:35] it you pull back the curtain usually
[48:37] seen something die your inward parts
[48:39] have been lost and now you step into the
[48:41] holy place and you pull back the veil
[48:43] and the first thing you see is all this
[48:46] beautiful light hallelujah it would be
[48:50] glorious it would be just a breathtaking
[48:54] scene did you know how many lamps and
[48:56] Solomon had in his temple 10 he had 10
[49:01] can you imagine the light when you pull
[49:03] back the veil and not just one now that
[49:05] Moses day they just had one now its
[49:08] course it still be bright but can you
[49:09] imagine the brightness of 10 of those 10
[49:13] 10 candlesticks and are matters to the
[49:17] priests and days of Solomon's they
[49:18] imagine they just got used to it the
[49:20] overpowering radiance of the light and
[49:23] we know what God was symbolizing here
[49:26] many Jews to this day are blind to it
[49:28] they don't know what this is symbolizing
[49:30] here they don't know what this
[49:31] symbolizes but this is symbolizing Jesus
[49:34] ministering to 7 church ages
[49:37] amen most people don't know that most
[49:39] Jews don't know that and I'll say like
[49:40] this much most churches don't know that
[49:42] either they think it's all what Jesus
[49:44] was just dealing with these 7 individual
[49:46] churches in Asia yes he was but these
[49:49] were prophetic insights about the future
[49:51] conditions of the church ages and how we
[49:54] could be overcomers amen the battles
[49:57] we'd face but then also the overcoming
[50:00] power and the light we would need to
[50:02] shine the oil for our day amen glory and
[50:07] so this was just amazing your mother
[50:09] Graham says this just wasn't his idea
[50:11] he says the Seven Church Ages were thus
[50:13] saith the Lord so this is the Lord
[50:15] saying after something dies after your
[50:18] inwards or wash you come into the holy
[50:20] place another deeper step in worship we
[50:23] know sanctification and now you see the
[50:25] light or the illumination of the Seven
[50:28] Church Ages hallelujah
[50:30] can I read to you again if it's all
[50:32] right I want to read to you again what
[50:34] the prophets said about the seven church
[50:37] ages because I don't want you to forget
[50:38] this I think it's very important that we
[50:40] read it let me get it right here
[50:45] he says this this this volume will
[50:49] concern itself with various major
[50:50] doctrines such as the Godhead water
[50:52] baptism found in Revelation chapters 1
[50:55] through 3 its main theme is setting
[50:57] forth of a detailed study of the seven
[50:58] church ages this is necessary in order
[51:02] to study and understand the rest of the
[51:04] book of Revelation how many one who grow
[51:07] closer to God all the time the only way
[51:11] to understand the book of Revelation and
[51:12] prophecies is to have the true
[51:14] illumination of the seven Church ages
[51:16] preached to us amen
[51:18] we will not understand the rest of the
[51:20] book of Revelation unless we truly
[51:22] understand the golden candlesticks amen
[51:25] hallelujah he says this is necessary for
[51:28] out of the church ages come the seals
[51:30] and out of the seals come the trumpets
[51:32] which the seven trumpets are to Israel
[51:35] the seven trumpets go to Israel and how
[51:37] do the trumpets come the vials and the
[51:39] vows are poured out of course during the
[51:41] Tribulation Period we'll get to that as
[51:43] well
[51:44] like the first burst of a roman candle
[51:46] listen the church ages come forth with a
[51:49] mighty initial illumination remember
[51:52] that so it's like we said we pull back
[51:54] the curtain you know let's say it's dark
[51:55] outsiders in the early morning they pull
[51:57] back the curtain and now there's just a
[51:59] mighty illumination it's on the south
[52:01] side they come into the curtain there's
[52:04] a mighty lumination and the Prophet said
[52:06] that's what the church Ages is to you
[52:08] and I amen
[52:11] he said without this mighty illumination
[52:14] without which there could be no further
[52:17] light but once the brilliance of the
[52:20] seven church age is given by divine
[52:22] revelation light upon light follows
[52:24] until the whole of Revelation opens wide
[52:27] before our wandering eyes and we are
[52:30] edified and purified by its spirit and
[52:32] are made ready for its glorious
[52:34] appearing even our Lord and Savior the
[52:36] one true God Jesus Christ amen praise
[52:40] God how they do you know there's just
[52:41] another that's a that's a page I scanned
[52:43] it's just that gives you another visual
[52:45] you know they had the oil and then the
[52:47] the tongs there and different things I'm
[52:50] not ready to preach really on that
[52:51] here's what I want to get to I want to
[52:53] get to this instrument right here this
[52:54] is what I studied on all day today so
[52:56] now
[52:57] this should all be fresh because I don't
[52:59] think I've ever preached on the
[52:59] shewbread
[53:00] so I did all the quotes brother Graham
[53:02] said about shewbread there's 19 no I'm
[53:06] sorry there's 18 and all the scriptures
[53:07] on shewbread there's 19 scriptures on
[53:09] Schubert it kind of worked out pretty
[53:10] easy that's a pretty easy search
[53:11] compared to something where you got you
[53:13] know 200 quotes or something like that
[53:15] it's a pretty good pretty simple search
[53:17] I was able to get it done on the plane
[53:19] and then finished this morning how many
[53:21] thankful for God's grace today how many
[53:24] grateful to feast on the shewbread
[53:27] let's look at this here that's like I
[53:29] said let's start with scriptures and
[53:30] then I'll end with some quotes to show
[53:32] what this represents we already read
[53:34] Exodus 25 so now let's go to Leviticus
[53:39] if you got your Bible let's go to Viduka
[53:41] let's just read some I'm sorry let's go
[53:43] to axis 35 okay I'm sorry
[53:46] 25 was where it was introduced and now
[53:49] let's go to Exodus 35 before we go a
[53:51] little bit against Exodus thirty-five
[53:53] forgive me I was jumping I forgot to
[53:55] have the scripture now this has got to
[54:01] be important how many leave it's
[54:02] important
[54:03] without the illumination without the
[54:06] brilliance of the candlestick would we
[54:09] even be able to see the bread no would
[54:12] we and that's why we get to on Sunday -
[54:14] well we would he would we be even able
[54:16] to see the altar of incense if there was
[54:18] no Church ages no could we even have a
[54:21] prayer life altar of incense without the
[54:24] glory of the church ages no you couldn't
[54:27] we need the glory and the light and the
[54:29] illumination of the seven church ages in
[54:31] order to see the bread of God eat the
[54:34] bread of God and able to pray have a
[54:36] real prayer life so we can get into the
[54:38] Holies of Holies
[54:39] amen you couldn't get in God wouldn't
[54:42] let you get in because God had a system
[54:44] you had to enter that way death washing
[54:47] and then candlestick and then bread and
[54:50] then altar of incense then the holy
[54:53] place and how we know God's a God of
[54:55] order
[54:55] God has a probe I did way of worship
[54:58] praise God so we see that by the grace
[55:01] of the Lord now this is once Aaron and
[55:07] Moses had everything set up this is the
[55:09] scripture and
[55:11] want you to see this verse 10x is 35 10
[55:14] if you got your Bibles okay this is
[55:19] after the people have been instructed
[55:21] first God showed the vision to Moses of
[55:23] the heavenly pattern that the tabernacle
[55:25] in heaven he showed in the pattern on
[55:27] the Mount okay
[55:29] and then Moses saw that pattern he
[55:31] brought the pattern down he instructs
[55:35] the people let's go to verse 5 so we can
[55:39] see that in verse 4 God Moses tells the
[55:42] people God commanded you to do this and
[55:44] then in verse 5 take you from among you
[55:48] and offering it unto the lord who suffer
[55:51] is of a willing heart let him bring it
[55:53] an offering of the Lord gold silver and
[55:56] brass how many want to be a willing
[55:58] offer er I don't want someone to force
[56:01] me to give an offering unto God I never
[56:04] want to feel like well if I don't go to
[56:06] church they're gonna think I'm back slid
[56:08] I don't want to have that kind of
[56:10] attitude I don't want to I don't want to
[56:13] serve God out of you know necessity feel
[56:15] like well I'm doing it for you guys I
[56:17] love to do it
[56:20] nobody even if nobody shows up I'll be
[56:22] there in fact that was last Wednesday
[56:24] which I'm glad you stayed at home
[56:26] because it was awful on the drive home
[56:28] can I just test it by real quick we were
[56:30] we were driving home and this woman spun
[56:33] out in front of us
[56:34] and we've got trailer been there you
[56:37] know the the nineteen eighteen wheel
[56:39] trailers driving by and the church
[56:42] Malakai lady were with me and this woman
[56:44] spins out in front of us and it was just
[56:47] God's grace she spins out I'm slowing
[56:49] down slowing down well I couldn't stop
[56:51] enough and we hit just a little bit and
[56:53] as soon as we hit a trailer truck
[56:57] started driving by you know how her
[56:58] thinking oh god I think I shouted Jesus
[57:01] or something like that mercy Lord or
[57:02] something like that and the woman got
[57:04] out and said are you okay I said yeah
[57:05] we're fine
[57:06] she said okay so she drove away you know
[57:08] it was it was just a little small tap
[57:09] and so and it was just amazing it was
[57:13] like after those first few trucks went
[57:14] by there was nobody else and we just got
[57:17] she got able to start again got on the
[57:18] road we got back on the road got home
[57:20] checked the check the van there's not
[57:22] even a debt on the van but
[57:24] we fell to shake the dents or any
[57:26] accidents so I just want to thank the
[57:28] Lord for that because you and I know I
[57:31] mean the you and I know with all the the
[57:34] trailers and the trucks on the road we
[57:36] could have been killed
[57:36] it would have been nothing and like I
[57:39] said as soon as we hit there a couple
[57:40] trucks went by boom boom boom and then
[57:42] all of a sudden is like there's a stop
[57:43] in traffic now who could do that but
[57:45] Jesus the righteous or order the Lord
[57:50] now part of me feels a little foolish
[57:52] for coming but the same time there's so
[57:55] many times church and you know this -
[57:56] there's so many times where the forecast
[57:58] says there's gonna be snow and there's
[57:59] no snow I was like I'm not gonna let
[58:02] some forecast keep me on the house of
[58:04] God I'm glad you guys take home though I
[58:06] think look at me I really am I'm glad
[58:08] I'm glad you stayed at home but I also
[58:13] knew it was of God too because the
[58:15] sermon I got for last Wednesday I got it
[58:18] because we had a snow day that or no no
[58:21] we had a two-hour delay that day so I
[58:23] wouldn't even had all the sermon notes
[58:24] had we not had the two-hour delay that
[58:26] morning so I thought well God was giving
[58:28] me the message for that night so I've
[58:30] got to go preach how could I get a
[58:32] message and not go preach so anyways I
[58:35] just want to say that it's very thankful
[58:38] for that but I want to be willing to do
[58:41] it I don't want someone to have to force
[58:42] me to do now are there times I'm gonna
[58:44] have to force my flesh to do it
[58:46] absolutely absolutely but as a whole as
[58:50] a whole what's what's motivating your
[58:53] life is it
[58:55] well I'm grudgingly doing this I'm
[58:57] grudgingly serving God I'm grudgingly
[58:59] paying my ties and grudgingly go to
[59:01] church I'll grudgingly shake their hand
[59:04] you know is that grudgingly or is it
[59:06] love from a willing heart this is what
[59:09] God was showing the people you've got to
[59:11] do it willingly you have to give God
[59:13] your will look at verse 10 God wants a
[59:18] willing heart now look what Moses says
[59:22] now now God says if you're willing
[59:25] you're actually wise to how many want to
[59:27] be a wise virgin
[59:28] well that's what I want more than
[59:29] anything else make me wise Jesus so here
[59:33] he says I need a willing heart and then
[59:35] Moses describes it as their wise hearted
[59:38] amen so someone that willingly gives
[59:40] their life willingly gives their money
[59:42] willingly gives their time someone that
[59:44] willingly gives it themself to Christ
[59:46] God says you're wise amen
[59:48] look at verse 10 and every wise hearted
[59:51] among you shall come and make all that
[59:52] the LORD hath commanded the table and
[59:56] his staves and his vessels and the
[59:57] shewbread and they came look everyone
[1:00:00] whose heart stirred him up don't you
[1:00:04] like that oh I want my heart to be
[1:00:06] stirred up when God calls me to do
[1:00:09] something I want my heart to be in it I
[1:00:11] don't want to have to try to stir myself
[1:00:14] up or atom try to stir me up or Malachi
[1:00:16] come on pastor get up there and preach
[1:00:18] come on get up there at least oh I don't
[1:00:20] want somebody to try to stir me up I
[1:00:21] want God to stir me up because the Bible
[1:00:24] said it's throw up the gift of God in
[1:00:25] your life see they God said only bring
[1:00:29] the people whose hearts are stirred up
[1:00:30] and everyone whom his spirit made
[1:00:33] willing and they brought the Lord's
[1:00:36] offering to the work of the tabernacle
[1:00:37] congregation for all of his service and
[1:00:40] for the holy garments and they came both
[1:00:43] men and women as many as were willing
[1:00:45] hearted and we'll stop right there
[1:00:47] because he lists all the things they
[1:00:49] brought they brought their bracelets and
[1:00:50] their earrings and rings and tabards and
[1:00:53] all these things and they game to the
[1:00:55] Lord so that's the next that's the next
[1:00:59] scripture that shows even the people
[1:01:02] that we were gonna make the shewbread
[1:01:04] had to be willing to do it I'm reading
[1:01:07] the Bible looks like the coal hats were
[1:01:09] they're actually the ones that made the
[1:01:11] shewbread not the not the try believe I
[1:01:14] know I'm sorry
[1:01:15] they're all the tribal Levi's but
[1:01:17] they're different brothers within Levi
[1:01:18] the co halves were a different family
[1:01:21] than em Rams family you know we're came
[1:01:23] out Aaron so there were different
[1:01:24] families in the same tribe but the co
[1:01:27] halves baked the bread but then the
[1:01:30] priests would minister the bread I'm
[1:01:31] sorry the Levites would minister the
[1:01:33] bread Aaron's sons so I can do preach
[1:01:36] more on that on Sunday Lord willing now
[1:01:38] now go to Leviticus please the babies 24
[1:01:42] this is one of the most beautiful
[1:01:44] portions on shewbread I think in the
[1:01:46] scripture because now we see actually
[1:01:48] when they would would eat it
[1:01:57] okay
[1:01:58] Leviticus 24 verse five bless you
[1:02:07] Leviticus 24 verse five now before I
[1:02:14] read this I want to read what Scofield
[1:02:16] said anybody got a Scofield Bible
[1:02:17] I'm gonna read Scofield you don't have
[1:02:20] to read along with me I just want to
[1:02:21] read it I want to read what Scofield
[1:02:22] says about shewbread as a type of Christ
[1:02:24] huh me know the bread types Christ huh
[1:02:27] me know everything type Christ
[1:02:30] everything in the Tabernacle type Christ
[1:02:33] now I don't understand this the 60 there
[1:02:36] were 60 pillars that went around the
[1:02:38] gate I don't understand that I can't I
[1:02:41] can't fit all the types together but I
[1:02:42] know somebody who can that's Jesus I
[1:02:46] don't understand some of these things
[1:02:47] I'm just like I said even with the
[1:02:48] shewbread
[1:02:48] I'm just starting to understand this now
[1:02:51] but they all type Christ brother have
[1:02:53] said everything spoke of Christ
[1:02:56] now Scofield says show bread or type of
[1:02:59] Christ the bread of god christ is the
[1:03:03] nourisher of the christians life as a
[1:03:05] believer priest in john 6 our Lord has
[1:03:10] more in mind than manna that food which
[1:03:12] came down but all the typical meanings
[1:03:15] of the bread are there gathered into his
[1:03:17] words the manna is the life-giving
[1:03:21] Christ amen the shewbread the
[1:03:25] life-sustaining Christ aren't you glad
[1:03:28] he sustains your life he keeps you going
[1:03:30] from one week to the next who does that
[1:03:32] Jesus what's your bread every week how
[1:03:35] do you get your nourishment I'm eating
[1:03:36] on the bread of God amen
[1:03:38] he says the shewbread type of ice
[1:03:41] typifies Christ as the corn of wheat
[1:03:44] ground in the mill of sufferings he died
[1:03:47] went through suffering was ground up and
[1:03:49] brought into the fire of judgment had to
[1:03:52] be cooked he walked the the what was it
[1:03:56] in the book of Revelation can't think of
[1:03:58] it now the the fierceness of the
[1:04:00] winepress the wrath of Almighty God yes
[1:04:04] he says and then brought into the fire
[1:04:06] of judgment we as priests by faith feed
[1:04:09] upon him as having undergone that in our
[1:04:11] stead and for our sakes
[1:04:13] it is mediation upon Christ as in
[1:04:16] Hebrews 12 amen so Christ is our bread
[1:04:20] Christ is our nourishment for our
[1:04:22] journey amen
[1:04:23] now let's read Leviticus 24 verse 5 this
[1:04:28] has the main types here to understanding
[1:04:32] this as far as I understand verse 5 and
[1:04:36] thou shalt take fine flour remember but
[1:04:39] man said that father or flour all had to
[1:04:41] be ground to the same the same type of
[1:04:43] grains Legrand said because Jesus Christ
[1:04:45] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:48] had to be finely ground so every bit of
[1:04:51] the flour was the same the simplicity of
[1:04:55] the property because it's so true and
[1:04:57] then baked 12 cakes thereof so there
[1:05:00] should be twelve on here one two three
[1:05:02] four five okay six and six very good
[1:05:03] they got that right to tenth deals shall
[1:05:09] be in one cake I don't know what the two
[1:05:10] tenth means I don't know I'm sure
[1:05:11] there's something behind that and thou
[1:05:13] shalt set them in two rows six on a row
[1:05:17] so see six ain't always a bad number I
[1:05:19] know it's the number of man but a good
[1:05:21] man there's nothing wrong with a good
[1:05:22] man is there was anything wrong with
[1:05:24] Adam when when God made Adam on the
[1:05:26] sixth day was anything wrong with him no
[1:05:29] was he saved of course was he a type of
[1:05:32] Christ you better believe it
[1:05:33] Dave ahem he was a type of Christ
[1:05:35] there's nothing wrong with that yes we
[1:05:36] know in man's sin yea then the six
[1:05:38] becomes a bad number but six can be a
[1:05:40] good number too because it's God's
[1:05:42] number six on a row upon I like this the
[1:05:45] pure table before the Lord I remember
[1:05:48] the days of Hezekiah Hezekiah is dad
[1:05:51] this is course after David Hezekiah his
[1:05:54] dad let the the tabernacle spoil and he
[1:05:57] put images and altars in there and the
[1:05:59] Bible said I just read it this morning
[1:06:01] the Bible said Hezekiah had to clean out
[1:06:03] the whole temple and he had to clean off
[1:06:05] the table you know why because
[1:06:07] spiritually there was vomit all over
[1:06:09] those tables because it was idol worship
[1:06:12] right and not only that there was dust
[1:06:14] God doesn't want a dirty house God wants
[1:06:16] his house clean amen
[1:06:18] if you're gonna eat bread who wants to
[1:06:20] eat bread on a on a moss-covered table
[1:06:23] nobody wants to eat bread everybody
[1:06:25] wants to eat on something clean praise
[1:06:27] God
[1:06:28] we got the five-second rule the
[1:06:29] three-second rule well from what I've
[1:06:31] seen that's even a bad rule there's so
[1:06:33] much trash on the floor and animal hairs
[1:06:36] and you know different things like that
[1:06:37] it's not even a good rule God said make
[1:06:39] the table clean praise God
[1:06:41] amen remember God said you said it
[1:06:44] before me amen that means God's watching
[1:06:46] our bread God wants our bread he wants
[1:06:49] it to be his bread amen
[1:06:50] he wants it to be clean bread and and
[1:06:52] the healthy bread God's watching we must
[1:06:55] give the offering we must prepare the
[1:06:57] bread and we must lay it before the Lord
[1:06:59] God wants us to lay our teachings and
[1:07:02] and lay the word that we preach he wants
[1:07:04] to lay before him amen and he wants to
[1:07:06] say that's good bread that's the kind of
[1:07:08] bread I taught you to make that's the
[1:07:09] kind of bread you're gonna eat on the
[1:07:11] Sabbath hey how do you praise God
[1:07:13] because the Bible said we are stewards
[1:07:16] of the mysteries of God let me know that
[1:07:19] our Stewart is overseer so it's kind of
[1:07:22] like I don't know if it'd be the CEO or
[1:07:24] not I've never been really I've just
[1:07:27] always like I guess it would be like the
[1:07:28] principal I'll try to relate it to
[1:07:30] something I know about schools the
[1:07:32] principal's like the general overseer he
[1:07:35] came in my classroom and he had to
[1:07:37] evaluate me mr. Smith a good teacher I
[1:07:40] tell you at the highest grading this
[1:07:41] year I said thank you Jesus in the midst
[1:07:44] of my busy life I said thank you Jesus
[1:07:46] and he said how'd you do that I said
[1:07:48] well I just filed the rubric I just
[1:07:51] followed the directions and I did
[1:07:53] everything you asked me to do but that
[1:07:55] really encouraged me but he's like the
[1:07:57] overseer he has to make sure the bread
[1:08:00] I'm giving out to the children the
[1:08:03] instruction I give out to the children
[1:08:04] is the right kind of bread praise God
[1:08:07] and so it is with any business someone
[1:08:09] has to be the overseer I think brother
[1:08:11] Loras does quality control I think if I
[1:08:13] remember right you know text me about
[1:08:15] Loras if I'm wrong they always you know
[1:08:16] livestream every service text me but I
[1:08:18] thought he was under quality control to
[1:08:20] make sure everything's the right
[1:08:22] qualities he's like an overseer you know
[1:08:25] what if something goes wrong they looked
[1:08:26] a brother Laura since they brought Loras
[1:08:27] you know there's no brother but they
[1:08:29] said Lawrence you know where's this part
[1:08:30] so he's got to make trips I don't you
[1:08:32] make
[1:08:32] trips to make sure will HUD the part go
[1:08:34] wrong or what happened he's like oh
[1:08:35] overseer well that's what the priests
[1:08:37] are that's what the the preachers are
[1:08:40] with God's Word we have to make sure
[1:08:42] this is the right kind of bread
[1:08:45] hallelujah there's nothing evil in it
[1:08:47] there's no disease in it it's got to be
[1:08:50] totally healthy amen
[1:08:51] there can't be no trash in the pot is
[1:08:54] that what happened with Elijah there was
[1:08:56] some death in the pot there's got to be
[1:08:58] nothing but life in those those loaves
[1:09:00] there must be life in the bread and
[1:09:02] thank God we know there's life in the
[1:09:05] Word of God the bread of God amen glory
[1:09:09] it's a pure table
[1:09:11] there's no vomit over remember brother
[1:09:13] may have said that scripture in Isaiah
[1:09:14] 28 there's vomit on the tables of God
[1:09:17] which which which is like the lair to
[1:09:19] see a church ages remember Jesus said
[1:09:20] I'm gonna spew them out of my mouth this
[1:09:23] is a perfect type of our day where
[1:09:25] there's vomit oh hey to say it like that
[1:09:27] but there's vomit all over the churches
[1:09:29] if they refuse to preach God's Word
[1:09:32] jesus said I'll spew out of my mouth
[1:09:34] because you're rich and increased with
[1:09:36] Goods and don't have any more need of
[1:09:37] the Holy Ghost one evidence that you've
[1:09:39] got the Holy Ghost is you want more of
[1:09:41] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:09:43] that's one evidence you really got the
[1:09:44] Holy Ghost because the first time they
[1:09:47] got persecuted Acts chapter four what
[1:09:48] they do they ran back to the prayer
[1:09:50] meetings that God give us boldness help
[1:09:52] me to be more bold yet they've got
[1:09:53] eternity in their soul they've got a
[1:09:56] seal brother had them in their soul to
[1:09:57] the day of their Redemption but they're
[1:09:59] crying out God make me more both for you
[1:10:01] Church we ought to come to churches and
[1:10:03] if we're not bold say God make me more
[1:10:05] bow for the kingdom of God that's what
[1:10:07] evidence you're born again you got to
[1:10:10] have more of God just like them they got
[1:10:12] to have more bread every week amen
[1:10:14] it's exactly right beautiful thank you
[1:10:18] Jesus a pure table but alert we're
[1:10:21] living in a day where most the tables
[1:10:23] are full of vomit God can't talk because
[1:10:26] preachers are scared are going to lose
[1:10:27] people if they preach the truth I always
[1:10:30] want to have a church where I can preach
[1:10:31] anything I want and I don't even care
[1:10:33] what anybody thinks other than God I
[1:10:35] want now they're going wrong if I got to
[1:10:38] rebuke people I want to say it with
[1:10:39] kindness and directness I don't want to
[1:10:42] get off into a critical spirit cuz I've
[1:10:43] been I've done that before I made
[1:10:45] mistakes we
[1:10:46] make mistakes I don't want to get in the
[1:10:48] wrong spirit I want to be in the right
[1:10:49] spirit but if I don't rebuke sin what
[1:10:53] happens god kick God's Word can't get to
[1:10:55] the people
[1:10:56] they'll come to church and they won't
[1:10:58] they won't die out to themselves they'll
[1:11:00] get comfortable living in sin they'll
[1:11:02] never get even past the outer court
[1:11:04] praise God and that's what I want to get
[1:11:07] to on Sunday that's why when people come
[1:11:09] to church there they don't enjoy church
[1:11:10] anymore because they can't get in they
[1:11:12] can't even
[1:11:13] they haven't even filed God's way how
[1:11:15] they gonna hear God speak in the holiest
[1:11:17] of Holies on the mercy seat how are they
[1:11:20] gonna hear God speak off the mercy seat
[1:11:22] when they haven't even died it out at
[1:11:24] the outer court and of course they're
[1:11:26] gonna fall out a church of course
[1:11:27] they're not gonna want to read their
[1:11:28] Bible anymore because they haven't even
[1:11:30] filed God's provide a way to get into
[1:11:32] the Holies of Holies but someone who
[1:11:34] follows all those steps they love coming
[1:11:36] to God's house because they hear God's
[1:11:38] voice amen they follow the steps there
[1:11:40] are truly super amen they're worshiping
[1:11:43] in spirit and in truth hallelujah that's
[1:11:46] why and as much as we're to show that
[1:11:47] type on Sunday I'm not going to go into
[1:11:49] tonight but there's a type there's a
[1:11:50] beautiful type there if you don't come
[1:11:54] to the house of God and worship the
[1:11:55] right way you're not even gonna get in
[1:11:56] you're not even getting the holy place
[1:11:58] you're not even gonna feel like the
[1:11:59] preachers preaching any bread it's not
[1:12:01] because the preachers now bring in bread
[1:12:03] if it's the word it's bread it's because
[1:12:05] we haven't done the worship we're
[1:12:07] supposed to do that's right
[1:12:09] that's right and that's what convicted
[1:12:11] so many people out in Iowa to come to
[1:12:14] the altar and church I'll say like this
[1:12:15] all's I preached on the sin was the same
[1:12:17] thing I preached here I preached on
[1:12:19] church attendance how people are more
[1:12:21] faithful to their job than Church
[1:12:23] they'll miss church but they won't miss
[1:12:25] their job hallelujah and the Bible
[1:12:28] commands we must gather the more and so
[1:12:31] much more of the Bible says as we see
[1:12:33] that Day approaching now who do you see
[1:12:35] that's really increasing their their
[1:12:37] church attendance well hopefully all of
[1:12:39] our hands can go up tonight because you
[1:12:40] did a good job coming on the midweek
[1:12:42] service but most people just Sunday
[1:12:45] morning hopefully more people are over
[1:12:47] here he's live-streaming but like but we
[1:12:48] take that for every Church also I
[1:12:50] preached on there was things that the
[1:12:52] Bible already said I wasn't trying to
[1:12:55] bring a new revelation I was just trying
[1:12:57] to get the people to do it the Bible
[1:12:58] already told him to do
[1:13:00] and there's numerous people come up
[1:13:02] prayer and asking God to help them then
[1:13:06] I preach on tithing
[1:13:07] I just hammered tithe and I just felt
[1:13:09] let the Lord to hammer tithing and just
[1:13:13] said the Bible says the reason you tithe
[1:13:15] is to let you fear God and so if
[1:13:17] someone's not tithing it's because they
[1:13:19] fear their bank or their mortgage more
[1:13:21] than they fear God and the church said
[1:13:24] tithing teaches you to fear God in other
[1:13:27] words I respect God more than I respect
[1:13:29] my uh my debtor who ever I owe money to
[1:13:34] and I had numerous people come up crying
[1:13:36] about paying ties they said God was
[1:13:39] speaking right to me because I wasn't
[1:13:40] paying my ties I don't know about you
[1:13:43] but do you want to be guilty of robbing
[1:13:45] God we should already hate robbing man
[1:13:49] how about robbing God and people will
[1:13:52] come to God's house but they had him and
[1:13:54] they walk out and the the bank alarms of
[1:13:57] heaven are going off rear rear robbery
[1:14:01] robbery but everybody walks out to shake
[1:14:02] hands and nobody sees it except the
[1:14:04] angels of God and God they write it down
[1:14:07] they didn't they robbed God they robbed
[1:14:09] God they robbed God and the Bible said
[1:14:12] these will not inherit the kingdom of
[1:14:14] God and brother man said tithes and
[1:14:16] offerings are eternal how do you know
[1:14:19] they're eternal because in the in the
[1:14:20] heavenly City when the New Jerusalem
[1:14:22] come down the bottle said the kings of
[1:14:24] the earth bring their glory and honor
[1:14:26] into the city and program said that's
[1:14:28] tithing and offerings did you catch that
[1:14:32] in other words the the people that are
[1:14:35] outside of the city the people that are
[1:14:36] not bribed are going to be paying ties
[1:14:38] for all eternity
[1:14:40] I wonder if it's because they didn't pay
[1:14:42] ties while they were on earth right and
[1:14:45] their first body God is going to make
[1:14:48] them pay tithe for all eternity because
[1:14:50] tithes and offerings are eternal I don't
[1:14:53] know about you but if I pay my tithes I
[1:14:55] get my checkbook out and I start writing
[1:14:56] and I'm not begging for money you do
[1:14:59] understand I'm just saying you don't
[1:15:01] want to be a thief and there's every
[1:15:05] excuse in the book but brother Branham
[1:15:07] hits every excuse in the book he
[1:15:11] he let his family not eat supper
[1:15:13] sometime or not have as much food
[1:15:14] because he's so he could pay his ties
[1:15:15] I've got a quote on that weight and he
[1:15:20] even put God paying ties over paying off
[1:15:22] his debts his medical debts and he go
[1:15:24] down there and say well I only got 5
[1:15:25] cents this week but I'm gonna give you I
[1:15:27] can't give it I can't give you your
[1:15:28] medical bill because I'm paying God my
[1:15:31] ties but see they'll make excuses well
[1:15:34] they'll this and this and that well why
[1:15:35] don't you have the same faith of brother
[1:15:36] branham head if you believe the message
[1:15:39] of brother Branham from Jesus never
[1:15:42] understand and then I preached on
[1:15:44] marriage but I bought out some some
[1:15:46] marriages there how people weren't in
[1:15:47] the honeymoon period anymore and I
[1:15:50] bought out pornography and I people come
[1:15:52] up men and women and women men and women
[1:15:57] weeping about pornography ruining their
[1:15:59] homes
[1:16:00] I grow men weeping and crying saying
[1:16:03] little Jessie I gotta clean out my home
[1:16:06] because it's unclean Church we just we
[1:16:10] should do what we know we're supposed to
[1:16:12] do but so many people are not even doing
[1:16:14] just what they know to do people say
[1:16:17] well I want to know more things about
[1:16:18] new things about God where are we living
[1:16:20] the things we already know yet God's not
[1:16:23] gonna give us anything new until we do
[1:16:25] the old stuff praise the Lord and you
[1:16:29] would have seen a church use just seen
[1:16:30] all the people come up it was amazing to
[1:16:33] me but I know that's how God does his
[1:16:34] word I don't know how it got on that but
[1:16:37] I told you I tell you about it so there
[1:16:39] you go okay I was just trying to get to
[1:16:42] verse 7 that's what I'm trying to get to
[1:16:43] all rights go to verse 7 living is 24/7
[1:16:47] let me said timing huh I got to take
[1:16:49] care of my body too
[1:16:50] ok verse 7 and thou shalt put pure
[1:16:55] frankincense upon each row that it may
[1:16:58] be on the bread for a memorial so this
[1:17:01] container must be full of frankincense
[1:17:04] one of these I'm not sure which one but
[1:17:06] they would take that and pour
[1:17:07] frankincense so the bread was anointed
[1:17:09] with frankincense upon
[1:17:14] DRO then it may be on the breaded for a
[1:17:16] memorial
[1:17:18] so the frankincense was on the bread as
[1:17:20] a memorial so to remember something
[1:17:23] frankincense on bread would help you
[1:17:26] remember something I mean know what
[1:17:28] brother Ram said frankincense was he
[1:17:31] said it represents service to Jehovah
[1:17:34] remember gold frankincense and myrrh
[1:17:36] gold deity frankincense in service myrrh
[1:17:42] death Jesus had gold frankincense myrrh
[1:17:46] he said Jesus was deity and service to
[1:17:49] die amen hallelujah I remember the Hat
[1:17:52] God's wrap gift brother man preach that
[1:17:54] gold in service to Jehovah to die amen
[1:17:59] and so this represents service of the
[1:18:04] Lord so the bread must be anointed with
[1:18:07] service praise God we must serve God we
[1:18:12] as a Remora remember we must remember
[1:18:14] the bread of God takes service we must
[1:18:17] happy anointed during service amen we
[1:18:19] must have the anointing while the bread
[1:18:22] is being served as a memorial amen
[1:18:25] hallelujah we also remember its service
[1:18:28] to come here and feast on the Word of
[1:18:30] God amen
[1:18:31] it's a service to God to remember how
[1:18:34] important it is to God remember if we're
[1:18:38] not careful this becomes dull of hearing
[1:18:39] coming to church does it become
[1:18:41] important anymore
[1:18:42] the bread is okay but I've had that
[1:18:43] bread before I'd I'd rather watch you
[1:18:45] know some game show or something like
[1:18:47] that and that becomes your bread instead
[1:18:49] of the Living Word of God well let me
[1:18:51] tell you the only thing that'll satisfy
[1:18:53] you is not a game show it's Jesus Christ
[1:18:55] that's the only thing I was satisfied
[1:18:57] only thing to make you happy only thing
[1:18:59] that'll give you hope the only thing
[1:19:01] that'll pep you up is the Word of God
[1:19:04] hallelujah see oh see it's got to be
[1:19:07] anointed with frankincense as remember
[1:19:10] the service of God
[1:19:12] remember this bread is in service to to
[1:19:15] God this is God's service God loves
[1:19:17] service and brother BAM said Jesus keeps
[1:19:19] all of his appointments at service
[1:19:21] amen all right versus finishing verse
[1:19:25] seven
[1:19:25] even an offering made by fire unto the
[1:19:28] Lord so this is our service this is what
[1:19:30] we have to offer to God after we've seen
[1:19:33] the glory of the church ages and seeing
[1:19:34] those things now we have to offer this
[1:19:36] bread as a service to God verse 8 I love
[1:19:41] this every Sabbath he shall set it in
[1:19:44] order before the Lord continually every
[1:19:50] Sabbath every time there's a period of
[1:19:52] rest this fresh bread now if you can if
[1:19:56] you know the history - they would switch
[1:19:58] out the bread every Sabbath day
[1:20:01] praise God let's keep reading it and it
[1:20:03] will show it every Sabbath day he should
[1:20:05] set it in order before the Lord
[1:20:07] continually being taken from the churn
[1:20:09] of Israel by an everlasting covenant and
[1:20:10] it shall be Aaron's and his sons and
[1:20:13] they shall eat it in the holy place for
[1:20:15] it is most holy unto him of the
[1:20:17] offerings of the Lord made by fire by a
[1:20:20] perpetual statute so sometime on Friday
[1:20:24] they must on Friday than the night they
[1:20:26] must have started baking the bread the
[1:20:27] kohathites the kohathites would be in
[1:20:30] there they washing their hands and they
[1:20:31] start making the bread and sometime on
[1:20:34] Saturday after the lamps were lit you
[1:20:36] know they're coming here
[1:20:37] they're coming a priest with twelve
[1:20:38] loaves and him along with some other
[1:20:41] priest would come in there they'd make
[1:20:43] sure the lights are burning they could
[1:20:45] say praise God the light of Laodicea is
[1:20:48] shining all around us that's what we can
[1:20:50] say when we come in the house of God
[1:20:52] hallelujah the light of every church age
[1:20:54] the Holy Ghost anointing from every
[1:20:56] church age is shining in us we're in the
[1:20:58] service of the Lord amen don't worry
[1:21:01] we've got the light of the latest in
[1:21:03] church age it's the overcomer hallelujah
[1:21:05] amen and after that they bring these
[1:21:08] twelve loaves in and I read from alfred
[1:21:11] edersheim one time that they made sure
[1:21:13] the very second the bread was lifted it
[1:21:16] took its place because Jesus or God said
[1:21:19] make sure there's bread always on my
[1:21:21] table so they made sure as soon as it
[1:21:24] was taken off
[1:21:25] it was immediately there and after they
[1:21:27] made the exchange on both sides of
[1:21:29] course they anointed it you know with
[1:21:30] the frankincense after that the group of
[1:21:33] priests would gather and they
[1:21:35] eat that red before the Lord so they
[1:21:37] were eating the old bread but God
[1:21:39] already had fresh bread on his table God
[1:21:42] always wants fresh bread on his table
[1:21:44] amen hallelujah and as soon as the bread
[1:21:46] was a week old they took it off and
[1:21:49] that's when the priest would eat it but
[1:21:50] when God's there in God's presence you
[1:21:52] always give God the fresh bread your God
[1:21:54] always wants the fresh bread before his
[1:21:56] face for worship praise God and then
[1:21:59] when the switch is made then you and I
[1:22:01] would eat there on the bread in the holy
[1:22:02] place and we'd hear that we'd hear the
[1:22:05] music going on outside we'd hear all the
[1:22:07] worship but we were hidden away feasting
[1:22:10] on the bread of God saying hallelujah
[1:22:11] glory to God with this frankincense and
[1:22:14] this this is so delicious we're in the
[1:22:15] service of the Lord we're eating the
[1:22:17] hallowed bread of God that just a
[1:22:20] regular bread this is special bread
[1:22:22] nobody keep this bread except us priests
[1:22:24] how do we have a special calling from
[1:22:27] God
[1:22:27] we're the ones feasting on this hallowed
[1:22:30] bread amen
[1:22:31] nobody else can eat this just us just us
[1:22:34] kings and priests unto God hallelujah
[1:22:37] I'm so glad I'm one of those holy
[1:22:39] rollers that I'm one of those that get
[1:22:41] to eat the fresh bread of God ain't a
[1:22:44] glory
[1:22:48] I'm thankful by God's grace program said
[1:22:52] frankincense is our offering of our
[1:22:54] service to Jehovah so this with the
[1:22:58] bread of God is anointed with the
[1:23:01] offering of our service we remember
[1:23:02] we're in service we come we come to
[1:23:05] feast on the bread of God now this is
[1:23:12] the thought now I want to share this
[1:23:14] thought I shared it a few weeks ago when
[1:23:15] brother Simon
[1:23:16] I remember when summer time was here and
[1:23:17] I made them comment about the twelve
[1:23:18] loaves of shewbread anybody remember
[1:23:20] that okay no all right now Church this
[1:23:23] is what I thought I felt this was a
[1:23:25] fresh revelation that I believe these
[1:23:28] twelve loaves of bread represent the
[1:23:31] twelve New Testament mysteries which
[1:23:35] brother branham already preached how
[1:23:37] many knew there was 12 new Testament
[1:23:39] read everybody know that and we know
[1:23:41] that we know what the candlesticks were
[1:23:44] right the candlesticks were the seven
[1:23:46] churches and
[1:23:48] Scofield shows us 11 in the mysteries
[1:23:50] and brother Brandon preaches that and
[1:23:52] serves as the endtime 1962 but then
[1:23:55] there's another mystery brother Graham
[1:23:56] points out an adoption series it's the
[1:23:58] mystery of the will of God so this is
[1:24:01] not directly from brother Branham but it
[1:24:03] just I believe it's a revelation
[1:24:05] now how many member the church age book
[1:24:07] brother Branham said whenever God gave a
[1:24:10] revelation he can always add to it he
[1:24:12] can add more information to it but all
[1:24:14] that new information will not contradict
[1:24:16] anything else how many remember that
[1:24:17] quote it's like with Jesus birth what
[1:24:21] was the first prophecy of Jesus birth
[1:24:22] well he's the boy the child is going to
[1:24:25] be born the child's gonna be the seed of
[1:24:27] the woman and he's gonna bruise the head
[1:24:29] of the serpent I remember that four
[1:24:32] thousand years before Christ was born
[1:24:34] you have a prophecy about a seed coming
[1:24:37] to bruise the head of the serpent a
[1:24:39] couple thousand years later you another
[1:24:41] prophecy he's going to come out of the
[1:24:43] seed of Abraham because God told Abraham
[1:24:45] I'm gonna use your seed to bless every
[1:24:47] nation a little yeah a thousand years
[1:24:50] later you have David talking about how
[1:24:54] my Holy One will not see corruption amen
[1:24:57] hallelujah which speaking of the rapture
[1:25:00] 500 years later Micah says the child Lee
[1:25:04] born in Bethlehem let me see what I'm
[1:25:06] talking about as time went on there was
[1:25:08] more revelation more revelation more
[1:25:10] revelation the new revelation didn't
[1:25:12] change the own it just gave us more
[1:25:14] information and that's what I believe
[1:25:17] now this is my personal thought that's
[1:25:18] what I believe this thought is 12 loaves
[1:25:22] have to mean something and I believe
[1:25:26] it's the 12 New Testament mysteries now
[1:25:30] let me ex out of here and see if I got
[1:25:32] them to review them real quick yeah I
[1:25:35] can pull them up here real quick boy we

[1:25:44] here's the 12 mysteries the 12 mysteries
[1:25:47] the seeds on the four grounds the wheat

[1:25:50] Jesus parables here's the twelve
[1:25:52] mysteries the kingdom of heaven it's lit
[1:25:54] now these are all called literal
[1:25:55] mysteries in the New Testament I
[1:25:57] remember that they're all called literal
[1:26:00] mysteries the kingdom of heaven

[1:26:10] away of the rapture
[1:26:10] that's 1st Corinthians 15 the will of
[1:26:13] God that's Ephesians 1 9 I just preached
[1:26:15] this I got all these descriptions
[1:26:16] memorized the stat the mystery of
[1:26:18] godliness that's 1st Timothy 3:16 in 2nd
[1:26:20] Peter chapter 1 the statue per man the
[1:26:23] seventh Sauvage that's revelation
[1:26:24] chapter 1 verse 20 the god father Christ

[1:26:42] of glory
[1:26:43] that's Colossians 1:27 and the church
[1:26:45] said these are all literally called
[1:26:48] mystery truths in the Bible they're
[1:26:51] called New Testament mysteries and isn't
[1:26:53] it shocking that's why would Simon who
[1:26:55] got done I was like hallelujah and maybe
[1:26:57] you guys you know maybe didn't
[1:26:58] understand what I was this is what I was
[1:27:00] excited about who planned it
[1:27:02] which King James Ryder plan to only have
[1:27:05] 12 New Testament mysteries it wasn't a
[1:27:09] King James interpreter it was God amen
[1:27:13] this doesn't take away anything from any
[1:27:16] Scripture what are we feasting on Church
[1:27:19] your feast now this is the most
[1:27:21] important thing you oh I hope you're
[1:27:22] feasting on is the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:24] Ghost
[1:27:25] aren't we feasting on the Godhead are we
[1:27:28] feasting on the statue ever man aren't
[1:27:30] we feasting I hope you're feasting on
[1:27:31] this the rapture of the Bride of Christ
[1:27:33] these are all loaves of bread that are
[1:27:37] laid out here that after we know the
[1:27:38] church ages now we can start feasting on
[1:27:40] the mysteries of God Oh hallelujah and
[1:27:44] can everybody say Amen if they
[1:27:45] understand I'll go a little slower you
[1:27:48] know what by God's grace I don't wanna
[1:27:49] say I promise but I'll try to go a
[1:27:50] little slower about this on Sunday a
[1:27:53] little bit but that's what was revealed
[1:27:56] to me I believe now I believe that I'm
[1:27:58] not saying I'm right but this doesn't
[1:28:01] take away anything from the Bible it
[1:28:03] actually makes the Bible make sense well
[1:28:06] have you ever wondered what those 12
[1:28:07] those are for yeah they might be the
[1:28:09] twelve disciples
[1:28:10] but what bread are you and I feeding on
[1:28:12] what twelve pieces of bread with Adam do
[1:28:15] you and I feed
[1:28:16] every day in the holy place it's the
[1:28:19] mysteries of God amen
[1:28:21] it's the mysteries of God for the this
[1:28:23] is our bread and then were you have to
[1:28:25] be a steward over this you have to be an
[1:28:27] overseer of this and the Bible said
[1:28:29] we're stewards of the mysteries of God
[1:28:32] let's go to 1st Corinthians 4 let's go
[1:28:34] first contains 4 I'll try to close here
[1:28:36] let me set my timer oh I did already
[1:28:38] okay all right
[1:28:39] I got 5 minutes about 5 minutes actually
[1:28:42] 3 but I'm gonna say 5 there's no way I'm
[1:28:46] gonna finish this although I'd like to I
[1:28:48] think I've reached 2 hours on Saturday
[1:28:50] night I think I've reached 2 and a half
[1:28:51] on Sunday morning and thank God my voice
[1:28:54] didn't go out I mean it's just God's
[1:28:55] mercy they were some long services
[1:28:58] brother Brooks even had apologized at
[1:29:00] the end we started 930 weeding out to
[1:29:02] like 1:00 on Sunday morning and they all
[1:29:05] stayed Church everybody stayed and
[1:29:07] prayed or sang or something it was God's
[1:29:10] mercy that's what he know it's God you
[1:29:13] know when people are still hungry to
[1:29:14] hear it after 2 and a half hours I don't
[1:29:19] mean to do that I just laugh cuz I don't
[1:29:20] mean to do that it's God taking control
[1:29:21] me it's God doing that what did I say
[1:29:26] first contains 4 thank you I just you
[1:29:32] know I just could tell was God and then
[1:29:33] the results you know people confess sin
[1:29:35] and that's got to be God does the devil
[1:29:37] want us to repent no doesn't ever want
[1:29:40] us to confess our sins and church I
[1:29:41] didn't even ask these people to tell me
[1:29:42] their their deep dark secrets but
[1:29:44] they're telling me their deep dark
[1:29:45] secrets I said so at some point I just
[1:29:47] said okay you have to tell me just tell
[1:29:49] Jesus you know I don't want to know some
[1:29:52] of these things I don't want to know but
[1:29:55] in another way maybe it was God just
[1:29:57] helping me to feel their pain you know
[1:29:59] some of these things I don't want to
[1:30:01] know that I'd really don't but see
[1:30:03] that's how that's how free the Holy
[1:30:04] Spirit was the Holy Spirit was flowing
[1:30:06] so free people are just confessing the
[1:30:08] confession just rolling off their lips
[1:30:10] like waves of glory it's just just their
[1:30:13] confessions just flowing out of their
[1:30:15] mouth I said hallelujah
[1:30:16] it's got to be Jesus because Satan hates
[1:30:18] to be exposed and when someone will
[1:30:20] freely expose their sin God's moving in
[1:30:22] get ready
[1:30:23] Jesus is moving in that anointing is
[1:30:26] coming back when someone will confess
[1:30:28] their sins because
[1:30:29] and hates to be called out but Jesus
[1:30:33] loves to expose it with the word amen
[1:30:35] glory first corinthians 4 that's when i
[1:30:39] can rejoice like i just i was on the
[1:30:41] plane and fly home just smiling the
[1:30:43] whole time i'm sitting next to a woman
[1:30:45] here she's watching her dirty movie or
[1:30:46] something I'm literally going like this
[1:30:48] with the music and saying thank you
[1:30:50] Jesus you know how Lou you know I'm
[1:30:51] studying and everything
[1:30:53] I'm sing along with the music you know I
[1:30:55] just love would I love to see God move
[1:30:57] you know it's just it's the world to me
[1:30:59] you know see that God spirits there
[1:31:02] alright four screens for verse 1 let a
[1:31:06] man so account of us as of the ministers
[1:31:08] of Christ and look whether we church
[1:31:10] were stewards of the mystery that means
[1:31:13] you and I and one others this is begin a
[1:31:16] preachers but we all have a we all have
[1:31:18] a part in this what I mean by that is if
[1:31:20] I preach something wrong then you're all
[1:31:21] of you are duty-bound to come talk to me
[1:31:23] about that praise God for the RAM said I
[1:31:26] don't care for your the janitor he said
[1:31:28] or trustee if I preach something wrong
[1:31:29] come come to me in a private meeting see
[1:31:32] your you have a part in this steward of
[1:31:33] the mystery the Bible said we are
[1:31:36] stewards or overseers of the mystery
[1:31:38] moreover it is required in stewards that
[1:31:40] a man be found faithful they had to
[1:31:44] faithfully cook this bread they the
[1:31:46] faith who faithfully eat it every
[1:31:48] Saturday faithfully exchange it every
[1:31:51] Saturday and they had to watch over this
[1:31:54] to make sure it was a pure table how
[1:31:56] many believe our table Dacron is pure
[1:31:58] amen in other words we are feasting on
[1:32:02] bread that's pure there's no wiggle
[1:32:05] tails it's not a this ain't a pulpit of
[1:32:07] vomit this is a pulpit of purity where
[1:32:10] the word is preached in its purity if
[1:32:13] it's not you're just as responsible as I
[1:32:15] because we're stewards of the mystery
[1:32:18] see in the New Testament all kings and
[1:32:20] priests men and women we're all
[1:32:22] spiritual kings and priests right okay I
[1:32:28] want to show you that and my times up so
[1:32:31] let me let's stand here I better get you
[1:32:33] standing let me I'll just read one quote
[1:32:36] okay from brother Branham and then we'll
[1:32:38] finish this nor ruling Sunday or maybe
[1:32:40] Sunday night we'll see I would like to
[1:32:41] do Christmas again
[1:32:47] [Music]
[1:32:48] can I share kind quick share another
[1:32:51] quick thought real quick is that okay
[1:32:52] this is from brother Brooks brother
[1:32:54] Brooks we were talking about the number
[1:32:55] 12 and he's like member Aaron had the
[1:32:59] Urim Thummim I remember he wore the
[1:33:00] yeren thumb I'm all over his breastplate
[1:33:02] how many over that stone representing
[1:33:06] one of the tribes how many tribes were
[1:33:07] there 12 the bread represents 12 tribes
[1:33:12] and how many know if you ever had a
[1:33:15] supernatural dream or vision where'd you
[1:33:17] have to test it yet to test it with the
[1:33:20] 12 rocks let me say like this if you got
[1:33:24] some different revelation or if you have
[1:33:26] some supernatural experience it's got to
[1:33:28] reflect off the 12 mysteries of the
[1:33:30] Bible never understand 12 represents the
[1:33:33] 12 mysteries of God and just as they had
[1:33:35] 12 stones there if you have a certain
[1:33:38] dream but it goes against the teaching
[1:33:39] of the revelation of the Godhead I'm
[1:33:42] sorry that sounds really sweet but
[1:33:43] you've got the wrong revelation like a
[1:33:46] woman now did I tell you this about the
[1:33:48] make up video I had a woman comment on
[1:33:50] there and said oh I prayed about your
[1:33:52] makeup video and God told me I could
[1:33:53] wear makeup and I said that surely is
[1:33:56] sweet I want to sound just like brother
[1:33:58] branham I said that prayers really
[1:34:00] sounds sweet but it's from the devil
[1:34:03] that really sounds sweet well I prayed
[1:34:06] about it and I can commit adultery or I
[1:34:08] prayed about it and I can steal from God
[1:34:10] shame on that person but I called her
[1:34:13] out on it I said that sounds really
[1:34:14] sweet but that's not what the God of the
[1:34:16] Bible said if you would have prayed and
[1:34:18] asked God and if you would have took
[1:34:20] that voice back to the Bible the Bible
[1:34:22] said that no woman paints her face and
[1:34:24] every three although three women that
[1:34:26] did paint their faces run of the
[1:34:27] judgments of God that's exactly right
[1:34:31] that sounds pretty but it's got a flash
[1:34:33] on the Urim your experience might sound
[1:34:37] really spiritual I said I said sounds
[1:34:39] really sweet and spiritual but that
[1:34:42] wasn't from God because it doesn't flash
[1:34:44] I get the other revelations we've heard
[1:34:46] amen
[1:34:47] Marie so everything that I hear every
[1:34:51] time you know if someone asks me a
[1:34:51] question I try to make sure it flashes
[1:34:53] with those 12 Bible mysteries
[1:34:58] amen
[1:34:59] I did something for me when Simon said
[1:35:01] that I thought hallelujah is there 12
[1:35:02] Bible mysteries yes there's 12 Bible
[1:35:04] mysteries amen okay last thing let me
[1:35:08] just read this quote this is from
[1:35:14] identified Christ of all ages he says
