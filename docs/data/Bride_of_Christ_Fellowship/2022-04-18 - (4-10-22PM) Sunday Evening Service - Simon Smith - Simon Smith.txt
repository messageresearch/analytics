think i just said that you guys would be blessed by it once we showed this and the ties right in with the end it's a perfect go-getter but uh amen feel blessed and the lord showed that and you know what it shows me that scripture shows me the same problems we've had in this day they had back there that's right amen it really just made things clear to me this is exciting i'm excited amen because i know brother jason he's full-time as far as he preaches constantly continuing if you understood what the pastors go to a pastor will get up there and he'll preach a sunday service and then monday is kind of his one day break kind of because the pressure's still there it's just like a housewife or uh you know you go to work but you know you have to do something you have to get something prepared to serve tomorrow you have to get something prepared the next day after that you always have there's always that thing on the back burner you have to have something ready for someone to eat and that's exactly what pastor does they get i guess probably thursday is their best day because friday saturday service is coming lord what are you going to give me uh mondays a little break the tuesday lord what do you got this wednesday's coming but jesse has three services a week that's called a lot of pressure a lot of stress on the mind uh i don't wanna keep you standing by god's grace let's turn to two sets of scriptures and this morning i kind of thought inspirational even though i had stuff but i i didn't lean on my powerpoint i'm gonna do that again tonight if that's all right yes sir amen all points take so much time to not much time let's let's let's let's go to genesis 4. i love starting in genesis everything points to genesis every question every answer right there in genesis we could literally prove almost everything right in the first probably six or seven chapters of genesis in genesis 4 we couldn't uh stand from reading the word we would approach and i know many of us would not approach joe biden our president various things but if we had to approach him we must be reverend all right much more rather approached donald trump uh jeffrey not the the clintons or the wishes of obama's but you're not saying but anyway there were a little reverence for the reading of the word of god so yes uh certainly lord we love the lord um amen so we'll read this here genesis 4 8 we're approaching the king here lord jesus christ and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper verse 10 and he said what hast thou done the voice of my brother of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground amen let's jump to john 11. john 11 17. then jesus came and he found that he had laying in the grave four days already now bethany was dying to jerusalem about 15 four longs off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother now that's two brothers then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary stan sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou had been here my brother would not have died but i know that even now whatsoever thou ask will ask of god god will give it thee jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day so let's say a word of prayer hear the father lord jesus so he certainly love you lord god we come humble wherever lord loving you know god i know you're so good don't believe it a little nobody like me in the world i know we pray lord knowing i'm approaching you lord god and bless the minds of people god hear all things out lord in that spirit realm clogs here and there in the little inlets and outlets that we're going to just ask on you and reveal yourself once again today or we love you bless the service god bless the heroes of the world um as uh we'll be having a second service here um for the first time i think since i've been ministering for brother jesse this service here this back in the study i had absolutely nothing and um usually i have something waiting somebody taught at home or a font or this and this but second service i had absolutely just got back there and prayed and said lord what would you have me to teach on the day but jesse had to minister along and spoke here at the end their first service about the resurrection of jesus christ and this is the time when christians churches of god are filled and there's christmas and they're going easter most of the time maybe mother's day pretty kind of pack maybe father's day more mother's day than father's day more uh sons and daughters respect their mom a lot time for their dad maybe that's just the way things anyhow i'd like to teach on by the grace of god uh on the topic of a god of demonstration amen so in my thought today my thought process because uh i'm just asking lord i had increased my thoughts here and just give me words and scriptures running and just kind of fill my my heart and my mouth with these thoughts here i read these first two scriptures and uh if you look at genesis four and eight you know we know the two seeds that came forth they're cain and abel and uh if you could imagine if we could like hover above that scene right there uh cain uh and abel meeting in the field and notice the worship the church service was over the vindication of god coming down was over and here now they're coming and meeting in the field i don't know who called the meeting did cain call the meeting said kane abel i want to talk to you here in the field or did abel feel led of the holy ghost to come and say cain uh uh maybe if you would just do it this way after god had already told him i don't know we don't know how or what kind of circumstances who got an invitation and who didn't enter however but one thing for certain we know the bible says that the scripture declares that there is a meeting in the field there was a council held and something in that council those two were conversing nonetheless uh obviously and and one said something and obviously it must have pierced cain's heart and king got all riled up and and and we see that the kingdom lashed out with anger lashed out with violence which is according to that seed line that is that saints of god is animal nature yes the nature of a son or daughter of god is not violence that's right the nature of a true son of god before the fall cain and abel had no there was nothing no violence whatsoever in their nature but we know in the animal kingdom that kind of violence was always there that is the oh that is the sign of the fall and now um because remember canaan were direct from god and there is no violence in god as far as matters as far as hatred or those sort of things that uh the the the world displays but here we see that what kanan takes on and bashes probably here's his brother's head against the rock or however and and sloom in that fashion yes and god comes down and sees this and uh speaks in with cain and all things but we have to remember that abel's body was laying right there and i don't know if cain buried him or not or however or whatever but i'm guessing probably not he was a was a cruel cruel man uh but let's imagine that's kate and adam and eve then come to find abel's body and they come and find abel's body because if you look in the scripture always the sons of god always place their burial to their children always place them back to where they're supposed to be married look at look at samson's father and his brothers went and got samson's body and buried it properly and the seed of god will always bury their children properly going right back to baptism so notice uh adam and eve and making dodging that and they and this is the child this is a child that eve had really raised up with kane and here he was looking at his your his sec her second born and she's looking at his body laid down and that body they had no idea what death was they had no idea what it was like uh even probably to even get sick at that time or never got a pain or an ailment or an infirmity or anything like that but now they see a something that was alive and now it is no longer alive right and they dig a hole in the ground and they place able into the ground and they covered it and now the thought is where's abel is that all there was of abel where is abel will we ever see abel again is this death you live once you're done and nothing after the fact what is the great question what is the meaning of life or yes is there life after death what what what happens after we die now these questions are revolving into the minds of cain adam and eve no doubt cain as well uh but adam and eve now questioning talking conversing one another at the night time by themselves and saying what would we ever see abel again he was such a good boy man look when he worshiped god that first time and how the spirit of god came down and vindicated because that's that's exactly what god wanted was that lamb's laid and that blood upon the arch that's exactly that's exactly what i thought it was as well amen amen sure now so and from that time the mystery had went full what takes place after we die yes it was a secret no one on the face of the earth had known i had recently looked at a couple of articles on the vikings and you read articles of the people of egypt and they we find buried treasure constantly in egypt in egypt and in europe and all those places and a lot of those hordes of treasure uh they say they're in egypt where because they believe in their ad as time went on and false went this way and true went this way and all kinds of things as far as religious at that time the false started believing that their natural treasures could be harnessed after they die so they would bury their treasure with them with their bodies so they want that after they die in their spirit then or whatever they were or however what was beyond that realm they could go back then and grab their treasure and use it on their other life and they say that's what the the the vikings believed as well they would bury all their treasure and that that then the vikings would die and they'd raise up and then go get unbury their treasure and then be able to use it in the afterlife because no one knew what was after the afterlife right no one had a clue what had taken place what what actually took place in fact you look in the scripture and it's not very very clear exactly what's going on there until it's revealed what in the new testament amen absolutely i notice he says but now now god actually give us a little clue here in genesis 4 and 10 and he cried what has thou done god is speaking the king what has now done the voice of thy brother's blood cries from under the ground now paul tells us the blood speaks he says that's anyone that that knows that the blood is actually itself can't speak it's a chemistry it is that right how many knows that amen he says but how many knows that the blood speaks if you want to put that down in genesis 4 he says what about your brother his blood cries in the ground against cain sure what his blood his brother's blood now god was able to hear the voice of the blood that's right he says that's right his blood is speaking hallelujah that's what about him he said am i my brother's keeper he said and his blood is crying out his blood is crying out it's a token it's a token that he'd been killed his blood was crying out against him but notice in the hebrews 12 and verse 24 the bible says the blood of jesus speaketh better things than that of people amen so if god was able to hear the voice of abel's blood that shows that what that that blood still had to be alive somewhere the life that was in abel's blood still had to be alive because it carried a voice absolutely right all but then notice the bible says his paul said that watch out look at he says and jesus the media the new covenant in the blood of the springer that speak is better than that of abel but now what's better than that of abel abel said this man is guilty this is the one that killed me my blood was shed and this and that and i was innocent the bible said that what abel has a righteous man his righteous blood was held yes but notice there was nothing to cover cain's sin but the blood of jesus christ now notice this he says but he see abel he was a righteous man he died innocent because he was what in the way he offered the right sacrifice he was coming amen amen he says he was in the way of standing for the real revelation he had noticed what was the meeting about abel was standing for the true revelation of the world [Applause] from genesis to revelations absolutely so he was actually standing for the true understanding that god had given him and was vindicated by god himself yes hallelujah he was in the way of standing for the real revelation he spoke it cried out he says the justice blood of abel cried out against cain but now to notice the blood of jesus christ not only cried out it redeemed he says it spoke better things it makes you sons and daughters it hides you from the wrath of god the blood of abel could not hide guilty cake what uh abel was born into sin he says but the blood of jesus can cover him amen amen let me try to but what he left the presence of god amen sure so so old cane come out today if you'd be a prosecutor against the word he said days of miracles pass he says that's all nonsense jesus is crying out against you that blood of jesus christ cries out cries out but there is forgiveness if you'll just accept it amen amen yes we could say the longer he says blood speaketh a better thing but now notice what the beautiful thing now can't now abel's blood could bring nothing but judgment couldn't do anything else but notice what the blood of jesus christ he says he says believe for safety he says believe he says what you want to believe for he says he says if you want safety believe for it he says you believe for your safety then apply the token to your whole family he says see he says how can he do it claim it if it worked on you he says and you and the word become one he says it'll work for both of them he says you and the word of one he's then apply it to your children apply it to your loved ones he says just like rahab absolutely because the blood of jesus christ is what he says it actually speaketh better things it forgives all sins amen there's nothing anyone can do they could uh dismert what the blood of jesus christ accept the unforgivable sin that's right absolutely now and dealing with this what was going what was beyond a plague if you you look at the scripture now um and god you know uh one thing about the lord jesus christ is he always leaves little hints in the scriptures little little nuggets no tokens there just for the bride something we can dig out of those sort of things and you know one thing about i love the the blood of christ speaking better things he reflected this if you and i spoke about this a little bit this morning if you look at ezekiel 8 and god picks ezekiel 8 this just keeps he picks him up by his aqua's here and he brings him to the house of god to try them and notice from the first thing he if you remember the opening of the fourth the seven seals the first four the beast say come and see right and if you look at ezekiel 8 the first thing god says go and see and he saw what an image of jealousy that's right he says you want to see greater abominations than this yes there's another come to see go in there and then he looks at that one he says come and seize and look at and see another abomination there's four abominations there good first four horse riders exactly what we thought amen exactly just look at that again but notice the beautiful thing what does that have to do with the blood of jesus christ saints of god if we look here then he's in in ezekiel 9 and the lord started to go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the abomination is done in the midst thereof yes not only we to call these things out but we're to pray for these uh it's like this clergy caught up into all these things for all the people causing these abominations we're praying for them hallelujah ray what you while applying the token upon the blood of jesus christ to those abominations things god said he would mark you he would see him [Music] because what the blood of christ not only now god had to expose it but now that he's been able to see it and it's revealed to him now he knows what to pray for amen glory made plain sure now notice no the book of job they say is the oldest book in the bible even though his face was certain this and then however the first five books were written by moses we know that job precedes or post dates uh or or predates uh uh moses and now the beautiful thing about job we get a real clear on how this this this question just just consume the thoughts now remember joe was considered one of the wisest men in his day in fact the bible said god god told satan he said look he said he's a perfect man but notice when he's confronted look at the thoughts in job's mind in job 14 verse 1 he says man that is born of woman is a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continuous knot notice he's dealing with life and death jesus man comes up and he's little he grows and grows and then he's he stays at a certain spot and then he starts getting older and older and then he's gone job is examining this you know why because job's gonna have to meet that too that same thing that same thing he watched as he as job would bury his parents and job would bury this person or that person this great person that great sister and he's like what is he said this is this is coming we all must face we all must confront this he says he says who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one that dead rotting body how can anything good come out of that because job was an old time he would watch a seed he'd go to a tree or a fruit or whatever and out of that fruit or that tree he would pick a seed and you look at this seed this brand new seed wow look at the seed but if it's going to grow he's got to place the seed now job's a wise man he watches the seed and he takes the seed and he has to plant it in the ground just like burying their bodies and many times without job would look at a seat and he dig it back up and you find it rotting in the ground and he'd come back up and let's look and then boom life then would come up out of it and he's like is this is this how life is going is this how is this what happens after we die when we come back it's a great question seeing his days are determined and the number of his months are with him thou hast appointed his bounds and he cannot pass we are only allowed a certain amount of time my apprentice seven years ago march 11 2015 died and i had no idea the day before he was his day he himself had no idea the day before it was his day march 10th but come around march 11 2015 he expired and went on where did he go i don't i'm not sure i hope doesn't look good but we're not i can't judge he says turn from him that he may rest until he shall accomplish all the hiring for his day he says now look at verse 7. jump to verse 7 thank you he says for there is a hope of a tree he says if it be cut down then it will sprout again and then the tender breaststroke will not cease though the root thereof old wax old in the earth and the stock thereof died in the ground he says look trees die but there is a hope that something maybe a tree will come up out of that he says as the waters fail from the sea and the flood declines rise up so man lieth down and rises not till the heavens be no more shall they not awake nor be raised out of their sleep he says now notice he's caught the revelation but he's kind of still questioning it but he caught something he washed this tree and it lived it came up and then it died and made me cut off here and a little bit sprung up again he said look there's a chance that tree can live again i've seen it happen this tree may not have but this one did what's the difference between that when i won the grace of god amen but he caught the revelation you know the bible says uh to uh he says learn all you saints i'm just praying phrasing he says look at nature doth not nature teach you he says look at the earth it'll teach you about the gospel look at the birds the whales the fish all the things they will teach you about the nature of god and a little bit about yourself now but notice here in verse 13 oh that thou would just hide me in the grave that thou would just keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou would have to point me a set time and remember me i don't know where i'm going he says he says but when it's time to rise he says i want god to remember my name amen absolutely he says now look at verse 14 if a man dies shall he live again he goes with the question shall he live again he says he says all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change comes he says will they live again he says what he says he says i believe i'm going to but i don't know how many days it's going to take but i'm going to wait until then amen he had the revelation that he was going to catch it sure uh another beautiful thing there uh if you look here in in john 11 24. when her brother lazarus had died martha said i know that she that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day saints of god how did she know that you know how she knew that how did this woman who hadn't even conversed with christ that much or been around how did she know that he was that lazarus was going to rise against last day because it's taught in the scripture it's revealed in the word of god amen now notice she also heard this this chapter in job also in psalm 17 verse 13 read that arise o lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy sword now notice verse 15 as for me david says i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy lightness so here uh martha would sometimes be in the synagogue listening to the torah being read and those sort of things and they would start preaching on the songs and she would say man there is a resurrection coming job said there's something coming david said there's something coming he's what they're looking for their change to be what in the image of god amen that's exactly right notice in psalms 49 verse 14 he says like sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them you know when the son of the daughter god dies the same worms that eat up the sinner's body eats up theirs absolutely he said that shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave with their dwelling he says but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave amen how did martha know she heard it in the word of god through what little little sentences like this isolated here one here one there one there one presents here one thought here one line upon line uh here a little there a little but what that was a revelation that came to her absolutely now he says but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he shall receive me say laugh now notice he says be not afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increased david's david's seeing all these kings around him probably when he's on the run this philistine king get rich and this ammonite king this amari king and all these everybody's prospering and here's david out in the wilderness rejected anointed yet rejected he says he says when the glory of his house is increased for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away you know when david fought goliath goliath walked out there and we just saw this song sights and sounds goliath had a big old shield and a big old sword you think anyone in the camp tried to take goliath sword from them absolutely not that was goliath sword you don't touch the champ sword he's a champ he's got the belt but when david slew goliath the bible said the ministry or the house the priest of god actually then they got the sword of goliath because we see later the sword of goliath was given to david goliath didn't take that sword to fight the afterlife he was done it was over he's got enough problems where he's at now he says uh for when he dies he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise thee when thou uh when thou do as well to thyself he shall go to the generation of his fathers and they shall never see light you mean like daylight no they'll never see it anybody ever listen watch those videos of people who god has taken to hell and take it back every simple blessing we have on earth light water comfort rest the ability to breathe strength many of them said that when they get to heaven or so when they were taken down to hell and they they were trying to fight the demons all their strength was gone strong men they couldn't fight him so everything good that we have on this side is not down there so count it a blessing but we can do anything amen yes he says well though he lit well he blessed his own soul and the men and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself he shall go to the generation of his father they shall never see light man that is in honor and understand not is like the beast that perished right there it is absolutely though they might be highly esteemed but not have a clue about the lord jesus christ not have a clue about what takes place in time today as far as the resurrection of jesus christ have no idea what that was all about and yet men are the hell of high this davis don't worry about it it's going to be all right now notice here uh where is she getting all these revelations i know that he shall rise in isaiah 25 or 7 and he will destroy in this mountain the face and the covering cast of all the people and the veil that has spread over nations now notice when he says in verse 8 and he will swallow up death in victory martha caught all this every he went to church her whole life he says and he's and he shall swallow up death and victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from all the earth for the lord hath spoken you know what i like i like someone that says something and then goes and does it makes it happen yes i think i've taught this before if you study larry bird if you know who larry legend is you know one day at the all-star game three-point contest he walked in that locker room you know what lady burns said okay who's getting second place okay and he goes out there with his warm-up jared jacket and winslet wins it he told it he spoke it and then he went and did it there was a time in one of the games he posted up against xavier mcdaniel and before that that play it was a game it had to be a game-winning shot i told you hey i'm going to shoot the ball right here and i'm going to win this game right here in front of you you can guard me it's going to be right here just be right here guy at the passing bird goes right to that spot backs him up turns around shoots it right in his face xavier mcdaniel was pretty upset about that but i like about when someone can speak something and then go back it up amen right it's what it's almost like a power behind it like almost like a faith he just knew he was labored knew he was going to do it and when you lift you you i said this if you access or even power now every man is given a message of faith yes some men who are heathens have so much faith they can make things happen because they believe right hand and when christ is revealing in his word that he's going to do this and he's going to do that he's said and he said he's going to do it then he's going to do that amen [Applause] i am not only your god he says i am your redeemer yeah oh my redeemer they weren't even redeemed for 2000 years after he spoke this well guess what he went and did it anyhow amen amen i noticed praise god if you look at this here in isaiah 26 19 he says thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise awake and sing ye that dwell in dust he says for for the dew as the dew of the earth the earth shall cast out the dead and the earth shall cast out the dead absolutely what is the speaking of this is speaking of a resurrection yes absolutely in daniel 12 and verse 2 he says that many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life he says and some to everlasting uh to sun to shame and everlasting contempt time and time again the scripture is prophesying that there is a resurrection coming now if you think about this when job said a tree there is a hope that a tree lives and what did job concentrate on job was concentrated on death he was looking at people who died did you know job knew about enoch but in the whole book of job job never brought up enoch because he wasn't worried about enoch because enoch was there right joe said you know i've seen these trees but you know some trees are taken to heaven doesn't say that he knew enoch was in heaven because the bible declared uh that that it was there he just knew it because it was past if you look at their timelines no i uh noah i think was even alive right around that time he may have been second hand third hand uh knowledge about all this stuff direct from the descendants of adam absolutely himself uh so here we see what he was not concerned about those that are already there there's only one man there that he knew he knew he had not died that was enough but he was concerned about those who go into the grave absolutely yes just like the prophet from god and tried to sound insurance he tried to do the old weird game with them said hey hey brother you got you got insurance he's like yeah i got insurance i was like oh that's good i was going to try and tell you something this net and the guy's like what'd you say the game assurance no no we're talking about insurance he says no i i gotta i have assurance and the brother's like well yeah but you need insurance to go into the grave and what the guy said he says i'm not worried about going in he's not worried about going up in acts 23 you know you say i just read all those scriptures in the old testament and if you look at these scriptures brother it's pretty obvious that there's a resurrection that there is coming people who are going to raise from the dead now remember this is 2 000 years ago there's people going to raise from the dead but if you look at the time of christ in acts 23 verse 6 in this council here in this argument with paul and all those things paul was a pharisee by by lifestyle before there by religion but when paul perceived that one part for sadducees and another part pharisees he cried out in the counsel he said men and brother i am a pharisee a son of the son of a pharisee of the hope of the resurrection of the dead am i of the hope of the resurrection that i am called in question he knew what he was doing by the spirit of god he was saying now notice this pharisees here says here's the sadducees do not believe in the resurrection i'm going to start just an upward i'm going to get them fighting each other and i'm just going to go out i'm just going to walk out and he called out and what now but the pharisees were like there is no resurrection and essentially there is no resurrection of the pharisees yes there is a resurrection absolutely and now they're getting in they're fighting each other like this and paul's just like i'm good to go all their focus is off of me now on each other in this doctrine absolutely so notice even at this time in paul's day the resurrection issue was not settled even after it was settled that's right amen but everything is a revelation everything but there's nothing can be revealed to you unless the father reveals it to you sure now notice here one day in matthew 22 verse 23 he says that the same day he came he the same day came to him the sadducees which saying there is no resurrection and asked him saying master moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother and now there was there were seven brother and the first and he had married a wife to see deceased and leaving no issue left his uh wife unto another brother unto his brother likewise the second third seventh all alone and last of all the woman died therefore the resurrection therefore in the resurrection of trying to figure this out therefore another thing they don't believe in the resurrection but it's just the trying to test him therefore the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven before they all had her and jesus answered said to him ye do air not knowing the scriptures the very scripture we just read they didn't understand that that's right he said nor the power of god they didn't understand how powerful god was well sure god gave us life but could god give us life again absolutely yes sure this is for in the resurrection no notice jesus said there is a restaurant resurrection he said they shall they neither marry nor the given in marriage but are the angels of god in heaven but is touching the resurrection of then have he not read that that which was spoken unto you by god saying he points him to the old testament scripture going to moses he says i am the god of abraham and of i the god of eight isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living amen to the point of god if someone is not even alive anymore there would be no there'd be nothing to reign over nothing to rule over nothing to love exactly but what god has said god had a plan what that these the children of god would come down here and be tested for character god that they would be sent here to see if they could handle the challenges and we see for the first two thousand four thousand years they could not pass the test amen that's right but god had to bring something down he had to bring he had to bring a new way he had to bring a new way of salvation or something like that something that could stand the time that's food stand the test sure he says now he says now god is not the god of the dead he's but of the living absolutely and when the maltese heard this they were astonished at his doctrine amen yes now don't have much more here we'll just go continue on here by god's grace now notice he says i am the god of thy he says i am the god he says of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob when jesus said that those men obviously were perished over over 3 000 years already and the pharisees studied this scripture they knew the scripture this and that but they never it never occurred to them that they were still alive now here's one thing they missed specifically there's one point in the scripture where it shows a dead man is still alive and what is that elijah one of you one of the one of the beautiful things about saul's failure about saul all being fought away and the spirit of god leaving saul is that when it was revealed and all that failure it was revealed to us what that samuel was still alive but he was not up there but he was down in paradise imagine being able the first man to die and he's sinking he's not going up like he thought but i worshipped right i had the right sacrifice he's going down he did not go to hell he went to paradise the first person down there abel probably a paradise of walls going where am i at and off above beyond the golf affixed he's looking at fire he's looking at cells prison cells chains those sort of things for someone like the captain but in this area there's water there water remember the rich man said lazarus come dip your finger put your hand in some water and put it on the tip of my tongue they had water down in paradise so they could drink breathe and live nabel's like this is scary where am i but i know this i'm still alive i'm still conscious but i'm starting to have a grasp they said what when you when someone goes beyond they have a greater sense of knowledge they know so much more about what's going on so abel first off getting a little nervous maybe in paradise by himself for hundreds of years because they lived a thousand eight nine hundred he was by himself quite a bit but notice who is the next person we see dying lamech one of cain's seed killed a man able still in paradise another soul comes down first one but he's not in paradise he's down in hell right look at this yeah i'm so glad i'm right here i'm so glad to be in paradise i'm so glad when there's water and the torments they see sees this soul come down into hell and the demons jump on them latch on them chain them up throw them against the wall and start torturing and evil's going i'm so glad i offered the right side give me the revelation of the land and he gave me the revelation amen i don't know what this is but we're okay i'm gonna be okay and i was like where are we where are we at it was like we're gonna be okay there's water over here but look at this look at these guys over here because remember violence has filled the earth my souls falling into hell adam eve abel watching this thing just rejoice and they say hey go to that edge and we can't get over there and they can't get over here that's right absolutely now a beautiful thing here is she said she says look she says jesus martha says jesus i know he says when the resurrection come he shall rise again but notice in john 11 verse 25 jesus said unto her he says i am the resurrection and the light yes he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live now notice he they were talking about resurrection resurrection is not a thing it is a person yeah amen yeah another resurrection comes when jesus comes amen yes but the first was able to ride the dead from the grave absolutely he says now notice he says now when the true easter seal on the sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed what the what god no this is the whole he says before that time we didn't know the world growth and darkness growth around man's suspicion theories among men's hearts traditions made up about what's after length what's happening we're into death men worshiped idols they worshipped the son they worshipped all kinds of gods and all kinds of people made claims they went in the grave and stayed in the great but notice god had to prove what was going on for four thousand years he let everything continue on and it said it's time now to reveal myself and i'm gonna show the people what this was all about yes and what did god say he sent a baby down named jesus a man and he let that baby grow in favor of god in favor of man constantly for 33 years and then at the end of the 30 years what does he do he said because that man himself jesus himself was not ready until he was baptized and filled with the holy ghost yes now this is what the test was on did this baptism of the spirit will this get jesus out of the ground amen god said i'm going to show you something i'm going to come down there and i'm going die i'm gonna raise but i need something first i need life amen what is that it is the holy ghost it's the life of god [Music] can bring you up absolutely the devil can kill you and take this or think that'll kill he's here what to kill steal and destroy but god's the only one that can resurrect absolutely he said now but now remember he says so and then of course we know that jesus raised lazarus from the dead uh too much uh martha and mary's amazement said oh my goodness he has power over all things yes he has power over death but they did not understand that he had power i'll say like this there was healings there was even people raised from the dead in the old testament that's right paul wanted elisha's bones it was elizabeth of those two bones a man was thrown they were they were running from an army whatever the man died and they threw him on the elijah bones license and boom he came back to life so it was possible we all now when that when when jesus did this in front of martha's mine i'm sure she ran the scripture said oh he had the same cooking powers elijah did or lights right but never has a man raised up by himself by his own power yeah that's what that was he said that was the secret of life and death was revealed what the jesus christ was the one he was the light he is the one that's going to raise something by god's grace amen now the beautiful word the thing we're on easter right now this is the day they celebrate the time when christ rose from the dead and that was one of the greatest things ever take place hallelujah it literally sealed the deal that this was the correct way this was the right way that what he was the true god absolutely but did he stop there no he had to continue on his mission because now remember what did he prove he proved the power of the holy ghost on this he prophesied about uh rising up he prophesied to die and he prophesied all those things and what he went and did it so what improved what he had was good enough sure but notice he had he ended up he could not leave us gentiles he could not leave his jews that were serving by that time in their same condition he had to now change them as well and give them a spiritual dna change absolutely and then when they receive the baptism of the holy ghost you actually became a new creature in christ jesus not something old may know something absolutely completely different hey literally no if god could look at you before and after the holy ghost he would say twice you would see two different people that's right that's right not just someone with a new heart not someone with just a new spirit but now someone that has the spirit of god and themselves joined together in one amen amen absolutely he says so he did not stop there he what he had he proved that the holy ghost of this way of salvation to this religion started all the way back in genesis this true religion was the one and true religion absolutely now and i love this in matthew 3 verse 16. and jesus when he was baptized went up straight away out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and light upon him see what this says here verse 17 and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i will please you all jesus had to do receive the baptism of the holy ghost and god was pleased with him [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] lori jesus prophesied also in john 14 after he said i am the resurrection life he says i am the way the truth and he said father pretty much saying follow me what i do you do what i say you say what i believe you believe amen sure now in closing no it's short but it's hot up here it's like a service we're okay in closing now we have it has been revealed to us that jesus is the true god amen the lord jesus christ and not only because we see it in the scripture but we see a change in ourselves yes do we see the same battles absolutely but the desires when you take away all this flesh everything when you take all this away and all this corrupted mind the thoughts of your hearts and all those things if your one desires lord i want to please you yes no god get me there you said you would change this body you said you would allow me to make this rapture lord god i want that more than anything all right and you pray the prayer say lord god no matter what it takes feel me make sure i'm ready it's sealed [Music] our hearts desire the very bottom of heart desire should be what our main thing is to serve the lord jesus christ to be his bride to please him at all times amen amen yes now there's a scripture here in romans 6 and verse 3. if you want to die out tonight however in the morning spiritually this is what we do yes romans 3 6-3 knowing not that so many of us was baptized into jesus christ was baptized into his death so baptism represents the death and burial of christ he says therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death why that like as christ raised up from the dead notice they they were there yes paul was eyewitness to that pillar of fire and with that pillar of fire saying with that fellaini i am jesus absolutely amen lord therefore we are buried with and by baptism in the death that like as christ was raised up to the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in newness of life why where's the promise he says it now he's going to say right here and we're going to bank on it because he's already showed he can do it on himself and if we receive the exact same stuff that he had if we're saying the same spirit notice in verse 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also in the likeness of his resurrection amen we get baptized rise what when jesus comes in the resurrection or the first resurrection or the rapture sure now i want to show you this i'm going to show you this little nugget the lord just throws yes bigger just free studying you don't want to test from just 12. he studies and he's got memory helps a lot too now i want to show you this to me this was how are you bad uh to me but i like the nuggets i like the goal i like i like to see things just pop out there there it is more proof amen another thing to put in the stockpile of scripture ammo because scripture war is coming that's right amen and if everyone the king indicators one of the key indicators of someone is a scene of god or even has the holy ghost they'll believe the word of god above everything amen amen and the holy ghost will give them the true interpretation of the word amen yes absolutely now let's continue on here and look at this as as christ had res up raised up from the dead we know he went down to the bible said that he what he was crucified he went down to hell and he preached to those lost ones at the time of noah for three days he went to satan he took the keys of death held a grave and then he ascended right now notice here in revelations one and seven now the book of revelations is a special prophetic book and you study the message of the hour the prophet god said jesus you cannot bring a trinity even through the first para first uh sorry the first chapter of revelations one because you can't bring it through there because it declares there's one person hallelujah one distinct individual person in the godhead that's right in revelations 1 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kinds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen now notice what he says christ utters out he says what did this man say what did jesus say i am the alpha and omega the beginning and the end saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the only time first the last the very beginning amen he's the god of time yeah that sounds like the time we're in the beginning of time started in the beginning at the beginning started time and then the ending ends time absolutely and beyond that he's been beyond that absolutely yes now in revelations and 17. and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last i am he that lived and was dead and behold i am a leg forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death right yes look at these declarations in those four scriptures he declares that he is god that's right that's right i'm going to show you something now remember this is free trinity this is free yes violence when was baptism yes pretty close right just studied out he found actually early stuff but god is putting jesus put this here to show that there is only one person yes now christ echoes this this is actually an echo because it's revealed all the way back into isaiah you know why he put this there why god put this there i am the first and the last this and this and this beginning again because there was a doctrine coming where it separates who he is yes yes now let's pull this up if you could saints of god this this is beautiful but just you might start to know where to go i've never seen it before all right isaiah 44 verse 1. look at this this is beautiful now here yet yet now here he says oh jacob my servant and israel whom i've chosen he's talking sweetly to him he's talking sweet he's just as a husband to his wife and oh he this is me thus saith the lord that made thee he declares himself as the creator you make it and form thee from the williams yes you mean for me from the womb even after the womb the kind of person the individual you would be god every hardship everything you went through god had to allow those things to mold you into a certain kind of person yes you go outside every tree is different well this this there's two oaks right here they're still different yes there's an orange tree over here there they're different look at that look at the branches one just like this but god is a god of variety yes he can save anything amen amen now notice notice this thus saith the lord that made thee inform thee from the womb which will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou just run who my blood now notice he says i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and flooded upon thy dry ground and i'll pour my spirit upon thy seed amen that's the same spirit we've received amen and my blessing upon thine offspring and they shall spring up among them as grass as well as by the watercourses and look at this very next scripture and one shall say i am the lords oh yeah and another says another shall call himself by the name of jacob one lord well i'm obviously of jacob's branch i'm yielding how jacob got the one that dealt with jacob that's that's why i'm serving well i'm the lord it's at the beginning and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the lord shall write something about the lord on his hand inserting himself by the name of israel notice there was three divisions three or four divisions already rising up because we notice now as god reveals himself continually he has all these attributes amen he's all these things there's a god that heals yes was the same god the god of jacob that was of abraham or was he the same guy that was of jacob or in isaac was he the same god of joseph they're already trying to separate and break god up into divisions all right so well no well i'm of this one now listen i'm a paul i'm a seedless algorithm all right all right right right they were already starting to separate why like the god that provides for me well i like the god that heals me how do we how do we know they're the same god drop the next scripture thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts notice he is not only king of israel but he is going to redeem them as well he is both king and redeemer running the same he says i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god amen yes notice when christ now notice they're saying this they're saying this and god drops his thoughts hey there is no other gods the same one that's doing this over here the same one that blessed abraham over here the same with the blessed jacob over here and changed jacob named israel he says i'm the very same one amen amen and that was the same revelation needed in revelations 1. glory jesus is the father hallelujah he is the holy ghost glory i love that hallelujah says there is no then besides me there is no god and who as i shall call and declare it and set an order for me since i appointed the age of each people and the things that are coming and shall come and shall shew them unto them fury not neither be afraid for i've told you from the beginning of declaring ye or even my witnesses is there a god beside me yeah he says there is no god he says i know not anything amen what these people were saying what these people were saying was they were already starting to get in their minds polytheism yes that influence because remember there was thousands and millions of heathen with god all right and just israel being around them hearing of this and this and looking at their own scripture that thought those thoughts are starting to corrupt their understanding of the word of god they're starting to crop their minds of what the godhead really was well i'm of the lord and i'm a i'm of jacob well i'm of israel one this and i'm that saints of god only one lord jesus christ amen amen now god had to pull this all the way back from there to prove it but he pulls this exact same scripture from isaiah why because we're fighting the same spirits the the same demons absolutely that's right and he uses the same scripture to fight the same spirits he's got the one word the exact same thing amen amen now when i studied this i would probably show you a little bit cleaner player planer but man i was like there it is right there beautiful oh man the trinity problem and polytheism in the house of god that's a brand new thing 2000 years ago no it isn't that's right it's been here before years and years and years but notice never really gained strength until the gentiles got in here amen why we have so many pagan roots so amen saints well we're gonna end by the grace of god on that note hey man we trust with a blessing jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen now when the lord says something he's going to do it so you can look you can just i mean if you you know you don't obviously recommend this but you can just close your eyes hold the bible hear the scripture and it's going to come to pass that's right that's right it has been spoken of god and it's going to come to pass whether you like it or not whether i like it or not or however but the saints of god is going to have that he has revealed to us what is coming i'll say it like this what for the bride of christ and alive in this day what is new how things do we've seen people in the bible get resurrected from the dead we've seen people not seen death and go up so where do we have the fear right if god's spoken there's a bride that's not going to see death we all have to do is go back in the scripture and find through already he's already done that right right and what about our loved ones who passed on our grandpas and grandmas and those who were christian they might not have heard the word of god they may have been baptized wrong this but they died in christ amen they might have the holy ghost before the revelation is struck they'll be there as well amen so we have nothing to fear that's right jesus said constantly in the scriptures fear not fear not yes hey man so anyhow a god of demonstration he shows you what he's going to do before he does it and then he does it yes amen if there is anyone that needs any prayer i know it's a simple study beautiful there is nothing new under the sun the divisions have always been in the you see satan already trying to remember if you study the true change book that trinity doctrine started all the way back with kush that's right right brother which was in what god sees mine or no not no but it actually moved on and it was influencing the people even back here for whatever reason the devil was always trying to do that great god up in the three that's that's the revelation that's the mystery of matthew 13 33 i believe and there's a woman and a full head had some meal and she broke it up into three sections and injected leaven into it who is that all right brother yes amen who else did that who took the meal the word of god or god himself and divided him up in the free park come just like that jewish man told the prophet he said you can't break up god in the three he says we know he's lord amen amen so let's our heads need prayer on anything god is able more than able to play saints players and singers and those with the gifts there we certainly appreciate all y'all coming out hallelujah i pray you're blessed and crazy astray your faith was raised to see this in the word of god amen i know it's just simple study but i just that's how i am i love teaching this stuff hallelujah by the grace of god what he brings forth and we reveal so boring all hearts minds are clear let's just raise our hands let's just let's just rededicate our lives again today the hands raised heads bowed let's say a prayer the father lord jesus lord we certainly love you you know god we know you're a discerner of the thoughts intents of the heart yes jesus lord the bible says wherever two or three are gathered there i am the midst lord

and more transparent there's no gray areas there's nothing we're questioning we know this thing was finished from the beginning amen he is the author and finisher of the faith each one of us he knows
