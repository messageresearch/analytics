[0:48] mastered but uh something that um
[0:53] to hear bye guys
[0:55] hey man
[1:10] this is just uh
[1:16] i taught this a long time ago
[1:18] part of this
[1:20] i've always brought my mind back to this
[1:22] study
[1:34] in five or six years now just trying to
[1:39] be the leader of the lord while i'm up
[1:40] here you know mostly i'm i'd like to
[1:42] have everything studied out and placed
[1:43] here there this and that just
[1:46] run with it and those sort of things but
[1:48] uh we're just trying to learn the yield
[1:50] too and just kind of follow
[1:52] what the lord having me saying i want to
[1:53] be i want to be more and more yielded
[1:55] every day especially on
[1:57] our daily walk
[1:59] with him so let's uh
[2:01] let's go with matthew 13
[2:06] 30. matthew 13 verse 30.
[2:18] and the scripture says
[2:21] let both grow together until the harvest
[2:25] and in the time of the harvest i will
[2:27] say to the reapers
[2:29] gather you together first the tares to
[2:32] bind them in bundles to burn them
[2:35] but gather the wheat
[2:37] into my barn
[2:41] so let's say you're a word of prayer
[2:45] during the father lord jesus will be
[2:47] absolutely
[3:01] lord jesus so we
[3:02] believe though
[3:03] that all things will work out lord and
[3:05] yes
[3:06] lord you're still a healer god lord
[3:08] you're still a miracle worker god or
[3:10] you're still uh all that your bible says
[3:12] you are yes i know yes you're real
[3:15] you're living you're breathing no lord
[3:17] you're ever amongst us you you have your
[3:19] angels round about your bride god lord
[3:21] and you
[3:22] you see all things you miss nothing god
[3:25] and lord god help us lord
[3:27] be mindful of those things god would
[3:28] always keep those to the forefront of
[3:30] our hearts god the rich and lord right
[3:32] in there was sealed and lord by the way
[3:34] that's jesus and lord jesus we'll just
[3:36] we ask you blessings little service god
[3:38] lord
[3:39] and lord we know all things we'll bless
[3:41] the people god lord i speak lord is your
[3:44] heavenly lord
[3:53] to really just stay right with the word
[3:55] and just
[4:09] good to be back here
[4:17] [Music]
[4:25] just
[4:40] there's so much going on in the world
[4:42] today
[4:43] and
[4:46] i guess by the title i'd probably have
[4:47] to say
[4:49] that maybe the title we say to the
[4:51] reapers
[4:54] so maybe we minister on that
[4:56] by god's grace or
[4:58] we'll see you see what comes to me i
[4:59] want to be keep my mind open you know
[5:01] i've been worried all week i went down
[5:03] here to speak on and
[5:05] i tried to study here and there and
[5:07] things got busy sisters we had a sister
[5:09] just move and she needed
[5:12] the brothers that could come
[5:13] we moved here this morning got out about
[5:15] two o'clock ran home
[5:18] changed and hit the road so hey man
[5:21] just uh kind of running around as always
[5:24] and
[5:27] those sort of things so
[5:30] i'm able to speak on say to the reapers
[5:32] of the lord go this way fully i'm not
[5:34] sure
[5:37] but we'll see my god's grace in
[5:45] i guess if uh if i can read this
[5:47] scripture
[5:49] in matthew 13 verse 30 the bible says
[5:52] let both grow together until the harvest
[5:55] in the time of the harvest i'll say to
[5:57] the reapers
[5:58] gathering together first the pairs and
[6:00] bind them in bundles to burn them but
[6:03] gather the wheat into my oh
[6:07] yes
[6:08] so we see two groups of people
[6:12] in the midst here we know this is in
[6:14] parallel form we know
[6:19] what we're going to see uh
[6:22] i we heard another
[6:25] lovely pastor of the jesse that go up
[6:26] there and we heard that the road versus
[6:29] wade has been overturned and now it's up
[6:31] to the states
[6:32] yes amen um which is a huge answer to a
[6:36] lot of our hearts a lot of our prayers
[6:38] that even uh
[6:40] got into the old
[6:42] conversation on the job site and
[6:46] um
[6:47] but being who we are we're grateful for
[6:50] those things amen but in this day in
[6:52] this hour we must also be very
[6:56] careful
[6:57] we know this thing is going to turn
[6:58] religious real fast right right because
[7:02] the
[7:02] mark will be those who will not worship
[7:05] with that's right the image or the beast
[7:08] so
[7:09] that's right what what what is this what
[7:10] would that call what would this call
[7:13] this is going to cause the churches to
[7:14] stir against uh
[7:16] the heathen and the women versus the
[7:18] churches or the religious now it's
[7:20] bringing the religion into the into the
[7:23] boxing match uh if you will or the
[7:25] political realm pulling the now religion
[7:27] into the political realm because that's
[7:29] literally the only thing keeping
[7:30] uh uh
[7:32] or something that could bring religion
[7:34] into this is that law we see that very
[7:37] um
[7:38] and thank god that the
[7:40] by the grace of god less babies will be
[7:42] uh slaughtered and uh
[7:45] how can god continue to bless the nation
[7:46] that does that oh my goodness all right
[7:48] i never know except the bride is still
[7:50] here that's right brother amen and
[7:52] that's uh the only thing is the prophet
[7:54] god said that's the only thing holding
[7:56] the judgments of god now is that the
[7:57] bride of jesus christ is still
[8:01] resigning on their inheritance
[8:04] and she will let go of the inheritance
[8:07] and it should be pulled up from this
[8:09] world
[8:10] and then god that now is gathered with
[8:12] his wife and he is going to show his
[8:15] wife and display his power before his
[8:18] coming
[8:19] yes and as he releases his power
[8:24] and his judgments uh the bible says
[8:26] there will be one question in the
[8:28] heart of the people's mind and that
[8:30] question will be whose name is on the
[8:33] lamb's book of life
[8:36] so that is going to now how is that
[8:38] going to be because people are going to
[8:40] turn religious real fast and they're
[8:42] going to be diving into the scriptures
[8:45] because remember the prophet he says he
[8:47] said he's at that gentile door we soon
[8:49] closed he says he says and people were
[8:51] going to the altar thinking they're
[8:52] being saved and they're not that's right
[8:55] the antichrist will be a religious
[8:57] figure but though within that mixture
[8:59] it's iron and clay and we know
[9:02] protestant protestantism and romanism
[9:04] will be mixed together and the
[9:06] protestants will lean obviously more
[9:08] heavy towards the scripture than the
[9:10] romanism and those sort of things so the
[9:13] question and record in the book of
[9:14] revelations is whose name will be
[9:17] they will wonder those left here will
[9:18] wonder whose name is on the lamb's book
[9:21] of life and is uh we're just getting
[9:23] done with that study there in the
[9:26] children's sunday school and lydia was
[9:27] able to answer every question when she
[9:29] came
[9:31] she got the title belt on that sunday by
[9:33] god's grace and she was able to pick
[9:35] she declined on the candies obviously
[9:37] and that's okay but she did get the
[9:38] title belt in the mvp status for that
[9:40] movie played out there so we appreciate
[9:42] that applause for
[9:44] wisdom and knowledge in the scriptures
[9:45] and revelations
[9:49] uh but getting into this thought here um
[9:53] notice but it says but let both grow
[9:55] until the harvest so
[9:59] in the beginning we know that god
[10:01] actually if you think about this now god
[10:04] put the serpent here
[10:06] in serpent form not snake form but he
[10:09] put serpent form here on earth
[10:12] first correct right right
[10:14] now is the earth for them absolutely not
[10:20] now was was the serpent in the original
[10:22] creation yes absolutely
[10:25] what about the serpent now was that in
[10:28] the original creation
[10:30] no because now the serpent has been
[10:32] hybrided
[10:34] has been hybrid
[10:36] to white but now and now that animal now
[10:38] has a soul
[10:40] area in in their in their heart okay
[10:42] they have an ability now to receive an
[10:45] empty spot in their heart for the holy
[10:46] ghost but they will never be able to
[10:48] accept it right by the grace of god
[10:50] because their names were never written
[10:52] on the lamb's book
[10:53] of life so
[10:55] as we get into it the bible says now let
[10:57] both grow into the harvest and in the
[10:59] time of the harvest notice they'll be so
[11:00] close but to the scene they're very
[11:02] elected the bible says
[11:04] that they'll be just running neck and
[11:06] neck a parallel one to another he says
[11:08] but in the time of the harvest i'll say
[11:11] to the reapers
[11:13] gathering together first the tares for
[11:16] now what should be in our vision what
[11:18] should be in our mind the prophet said
[11:20] the prophet god said what he says watch
[11:21] the verbal curtain he says watch he says
[11:23] uh rome he says he says watch the bamboo
[11:26] curtain he says watch china jesus watch
[11:28] the king of the north he says and watch
[11:30] uh the catholic church and those sorts
[11:31] of things and what he said was to watch
[11:32] watch those things right yep so we're to
[11:34] wash those things because the first
[11:35] thing we're going to see he says is the
[11:38] binding together of the tares the
[11:40] antichrist system will bow together he
[11:43] says and bind them in bundles to burn
[11:46] them into what groups what are bundles
[11:49] they're actually into groups that's what
[11:51] they're into what denominations the
[11:54] bible talks about the great uh the
[11:56] of babylon which is revelation 17 and
[11:58] she was what the mother of daughters and
[12:01] she would have children who are children
[12:04] because what the catholic church came
[12:05] out and then we see lutheranism and then
[12:07] protestantism
[12:09] of methodists and all those things and
[12:11] that's what pentecost and now saints of
[12:13] god we must be careful as the holy ghost
[12:15] has led us now into receiving this
[12:17] message not all israel's
[12:23] remember israel anointing will be the
[12:25] same it will be the same holy ghost on
[12:28] every vessel but the difference will be
[12:30] the teaching amen amen amen
[12:33] the difference will be the teaching we
[12:35] just had a brother come a little bit ago
[12:37] and he said he's we need to lay down all
[12:39] doctrine well let's let's not go that
[12:41] far i wouldn't say that all the way
[12:42] because we need doctrine we have
[12:45] the holy ghost in jesus said what we are
[12:47] to be true worshipers in spirit
[12:50] and in truth we must have one the holy
[12:54] ghost residing in us and what we must
[12:56] have our doctrine just as close as we
[12:59] can get to the perfection amen exactly
[13:00] right we need to prove all the things
[13:02] went through the scriptures show them
[13:04] the quotes bring it through the shadows
[13:05] and time saints of god the holy ghost
[13:07] will lead and guide us what into all
[13:10] truth he promised it i believe it and he
[13:13] is still doing it absolutely amen
[13:17] my old pastor right there dove to the
[13:19] scriptures what the holy spirit will
[13:21] reveal we'll open these things up right
[13:24] here
[13:25] in this bible right but in the message
[13:28] quotes and those sort of things thanks
[13:29] to god the word of god is still waiting
[13:32] absolutely it's going to open continue
[13:35] amen amen amen he said but no notice yes
[13:38] and then at the end of that he says
[13:40] after we see these bundles he says but
[13:42] gather wheat into my
[13:45] bar absolutely sure yes
[13:49] how many here believe that we are wheat
[13:51] yes amen
[13:52] absolutely i believe that we are weak by
[13:54] the grace of god yes hallelujah now what
[13:57] i taught
[13:58] i had come a couple weeks ago on
[13:59] wednesday
[14:01] and the way
[14:03] that that study went i came back home
[14:05] and i taught it on a wednesday and then
[14:07] my home assembly
[14:10] and the way that the way that looks
[14:12] saints of god that's literally i really
[14:13] believe that's literally what we what
[14:16] god is going to vindicate as his bride
[14:21] yes the ones that can love one another
[14:26] amen the exact correct
[14:29] way hallelujah
[14:32] my brother had texted me after that and
[14:33] said brother he said
[14:35] he said brother he said he said we're
[14:37] doing a lot of soul searching here after
[14:38] that when i said amen praise the lord we
[14:40] all glory
[14:41] to the grace of god no matter
[14:47] or whoever
[14:49] if we can love each other beyond
[14:53] fully 100 agreeing
[14:55] and one system i see like this one
[14:57] brother might see like this with saints
[14:58] of god if you can literally look at them
[15:01] and love them as are he as a spiritual
[15:04] brother which should be what closer than
[15:06] a natural that's right they've got the
[15:08] holy ghost and i've got the holy ghost
[15:11] now we're actually a spiritual eternal
[15:14] being that can look past it amen
[15:16] hallelujah the god of them shall love
[15:18] the god and me and the god of me should
[15:20] love the god of them
[15:22] amen that's what we're looking for amen
[15:24] yes
[15:25] and absolutely nothing creeping their
[15:27] hearts nothing yes praise god
[15:31] hallelujah what the problem's got to do
[15:32] is there's coming a time where we will
[15:34] we will come together it will be
[15:36] rejoicing and we will weep
[15:51] and this is exactly the exact same thing
[15:53] that what saint peter
[15:55] started preaching on the day he pulled
[15:57] on when when the holy ghost found the
[15:59] first time in the book of acts he says
[16:01] and it shall come to pass joel 2 and 28
[16:03] and shall come to pass afterward that
[16:05] i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[16:07] and your sons and your daughters shall
[16:09] prophesy he says your old man shall
[16:11] dream green seasons for your and your
[16:13] young men shall see visions
[16:16] and also upon the servants upon the
[16:18] handmaids in those days will i pour out
[16:20] my spirits things for god i believe
[16:21] we're about ready to see another out
[16:23] horn amen jesus and i will shoot
[16:25] wonders in the heavens and the earth
[16:27] blood and fire smoking pillars now
[16:29] notice
[16:30] the sun shall be darkened in sir the sun
[16:33] shall be turned into darkness
[16:36] and the moon into blood before the great
[16:39] and terrible day of the lord come amen
[16:42] now
[16:43] let's go jump to uh amos 5 and 18.
[16:47] now notice what the bible what the
[16:49] scripture says here now amos amos said
[16:51] he says i was not born probably he says
[16:53] my daddy wasn't probably he says but god
[16:55] gave me a thus say the lord
[16:59] [Applause]
[17:01] he said i had no spiritual experience of
[17:03] anything because i probably practiced
[17:04] the farmer right he's but god gave him
[17:06] the word of god he was he he was just
[17:08] like us amen
[17:10] [Applause]
[17:11] we are the ones who the word of god came
[17:14] to amen
[17:15] glory he says when you eat the book
[17:17] you'll prophesy again
[17:19] yes amen
[17:21] [Applause]
[17:23] to you the desire is of the day of the
[17:26] lord
[17:27] he says and to what end is it for you he
[17:30] says the day of the lord is darkness and
[17:33] not
[17:34] not light that's right in the evening
[17:36] time there shall be light
[17:38] that was the evening time of saints of
[17:40] god
[17:41] when this day when this dark day we say
[17:44] to god we are in a day that is so dark
[17:48] yes
[17:49] literally
[17:50] it is complete i'm saying like this
[17:52] there is just complete
[17:53] darkness out there
[17:55] i'm now doing a job in elementary
[17:59] and it's and they have the
[18:01] homosexual rainbow in a big section of
[18:04] their hallway right here just about this
[18:06] big like this
[18:07] not seven colors six colors and then
[18:10] right above it says be who you want to
[18:12] be and it's all in the in those six
[18:15] colors your
[18:16] states of god they're training the
[18:18] children already to pick and choose and
[18:21] to be it's what is it in the state of
[18:23] confusion
[18:25] a state of darkness what is confusion it
[18:28] is a darkness
[18:30] let me tell you when you are confused
[18:32] you will not be able to tell what is
[18:34] going on absolutely this should be what
[18:36] it should be as
[18:38] everything should be as simple as black
[18:39] and white that's it that's how it's
[18:41] going to be right but what confusion
[18:43] sets on and you cannot even you can
[18:44] understand anything you can't figure it
[18:46] out something's you really they cannot
[18:48] even have the ability to reason simple
[18:51] common sense that's right brother
[18:53] normal things they'll not be able to
[18:54] pick up why because it's that dark
[18:58] absolutely
[18:59] he says he's in if a man that flee from
[19:02] a lion he says in a bear match him he
[19:04] says or went into a house and leaned it
[19:06] on a wall and a serpent bit him at this
[19:08] time of darkness things of god they'll
[19:10] try and get away from this but something
[19:11] else will get them
[19:13] they will not be able to discern they'll
[19:15] try and run from it but because it's so
[19:17] dark they'll not be able to see the next
[19:19] thing coming amen right right that's why
[19:21] the bible says what the wise virgin had
[19:23] their lambs filled
[19:26] and and burning and shrimping
[19:29] and they had extra oil off yeah
[19:31] absolutely why because it was complete
[19:33] why did i need those ladders because
[19:34] it's a complete darkness
[19:37] what it was the coming of the lord for
[19:39] his god amen amen
[19:42] absolutely
[19:43] shall not the day of the lord be
[19:45] darkness and not light
[19:48] remember what malachi 4 was sent before
[19:50] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[19:52] sure right
[19:54] he says and even very dark
[19:57] he says and no brightness in it
[20:01] i hate i despise your fish feast days he
[20:03] says and i will not spell sees a smell
[20:05] in your solemn assemblies in other words
[20:06] he's looking for what
[20:08] this thing is going to be finished
[20:11] right confusion everywhere
[20:14] try to witness on the job and this one
[20:16] no matter what you say this one sees it
[20:18] this way this one sees it that way what
[20:19] with absolutely no bible backing
[20:22] right they just think this this one
[20:24] thinks this way this one thinks this way
[20:26] this one thinks this way and they just
[20:28] continue on living the exact same kind
[20:30] of life they always live but saints of
[20:31] god we were giving something we were
[20:33] given something much more right
[20:38] the word of god hallelujah
[20:41] it is spirit
[20:42] and life
[20:44] right
[20:45] and though we were given this the bible
[20:47] says if you walk in the light as you're
[20:49] as he is in the light and that's what
[20:51] we're to do if the holy ghost i'll say
[20:53] like this in this dark hour
[20:57] and you are a seed of god and you
[20:58] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[21:01] you have now been joined with god and
[21:03] the bible says that god is light and now
[21:04] you are a carrier of the lord
[21:07] amen
[21:11] you should think different absolutely
[21:13] and what you should be able to be seen
[21:15] by the grace of god hallelujah that's
[21:17] right
[21:19] how much light are we emitting
[21:23] there are stars
[21:25] so this year's new series
[21:27] years ago
[21:29] there are stars
[21:30] you can see with your naked eye
[21:32] yes
[21:33] you walk outside and see all that little
[21:35] constellation there constellation there
[21:38] and those are what probably they type of
[21:39] the push version
[21:41] sure and then if you take out a
[21:44] magnifying or or like there's a
[21:45] telescope and you look and you were able
[21:47] to see stars you were not able to see
[21:50] that the world was not even seeing those
[21:52] lights those are what they justify
[21:54] those that live just like the world but
[21:56] what they have a seed of life in them
[21:58] and then the stars water they were able
[22:00] to be seen but just barely in the
[22:03] darkness but then here comes the moon
[22:05] actually the moon can light up
[22:07] [Applause]
[22:11] she can light it yeah glory you go out
[22:13] on one of the full moons however and
[22:14] especially with the cold days if it's
[22:16] got snow on the ground and while you
[22:18] don't like that we can walk the entire
[22:20] dark you can walk all night and not in
[22:22] that trip over one thing
[22:24] because the moon can light it up that's
[22:26] right absolutely sure amen now let's
[22:28] continue on by god's grace
[22:31] ah
[22:32] as i was thinking on these things things
[22:34] of
[22:38] god might not be something tremendously
[22:41] deep or however
[22:45] when jesus says to the reapers
[22:49] he says gather up the tares
[22:52] and then bind them and then then he says
[22:54] gather up the wheat
[22:57] saints of god
[23:00] it's so dark out there how will he know
[23:02] which one's which all right
[23:04] now notice here i want to kind of teach
[23:06] this and emphasize
[23:09] in matthew 3 and 1
[23:12] notice how this works in matthew 3 and 1
[23:14] he says in those days came john the
[23:16] baptist preaching in the wilderness of
[23:18] judea and saying repent ye for the
[23:21] kingdom of heaven is at hand
[23:24] so notice the prophet of god comes out
[23:26] and he has what a message and his
[23:29] message is he's what he says the kingdom
[23:30] of god is right now at hand absolutely
[23:33] this is the time when uh we're too uh
[23:36] when something great is going to take
[23:38] place absolutely sure now now also
[23:42] as john the baptist would get done with
[23:44] his ministries he said he said he's and
[23:46] jesus must increase he says i must
[23:48] decrease uh christ and picks up the the
[23:51] baton if you will just don't know about
[23:53] that the battalion says christian knows
[23:55] about that
[23:56] the baton
[23:57] and we see here in matthew 4 a little
[24:00] bit further on that when jesus heard
[24:02] that john was cast into prison he
[24:03] departed into galilee
[24:06] and as he went this way in verse 17 he
[24:08] says and from that time jesus began to
[24:11] preach and to say repent for the kingdom
[24:13] of heaven is at hand
[24:15] so notice jesus has the exact same
[24:17] message as what john the baptist they're
[24:20] preaching the same thing they want this
[24:22] is the time this is the time absolutely
[24:23] saints of god and the kingdom of heaven
[24:26] is about to be ended right now
[24:30] this thing is about
[24:32] to finish
[24:34] i heard a minister that i enjoy
[24:37] a minister i enjoy listening to he said
[24:39] he said saints of god he says we better
[24:41] run to the altar
[24:45] because we've heard the message dollar
[24:46] does not mean one thing
[24:50] because there's not no guarantee in
[24:52] hearing the guarantee is being filled
[24:55] with the holy ghost amen
[24:56] when you have been filled with the holy
[24:58] ghost and what is the holy ghost it is a
[25:00] new
[25:01] birth and what is a mess
[25:04] absolutely
[25:06] and he says what run to the altar
[25:09] make sure that you are ready to go
[25:12] check everything i'll say this when i
[25:14] get ready to go to thailand
[25:17] well
[25:19] i'm kind of one of those last second
[25:20] guys
[25:21] just because the way my life goes
[25:25] okay the night before thailand
[25:34] you start throwing stuff in there
[25:37] because what i got work
[25:39] you gotta go from work then you do bible
[25:40] study here there you get someone needs
[25:41] help this is that you're gonna do that
[25:42] business so i'm left to the night before
[25:45] using the pack
[25:48] but one thing for certain i made sure i
[25:50] had my driver's license
[25:52] and i had my passport
[25:54] and
[25:58] those three things right there are musts
[26:00] absolutely you must have those what you
[26:02] bring your bible you bring your word you
[26:03] bring your laptop what for teaching
[26:05] those things in other words when you're
[26:07] going out of town we're going to
[26:09] overseas what we're going to do whatever
[26:10] god would have us do we want to be ready
[26:13] for anything that's coming because why
[26:16] he said the only way to get there is to
[26:18] have certain things
[26:20] sure
[26:23] now let's continue on here
[26:28] john baptist
[26:29] ministry was
[26:31] repent for the kingdom of god is saying
[26:33] heaven is a hand
[26:36] he was all the scene jesus comes up
[26:38] repent for the kingdom of heaven
[26:41] isn't he
[26:42] and then we see later here in matthew 10
[26:45] and when he had called unto him his
[26:47] twelve disciples he gave them power
[26:50] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[26:52] to hear all manners of sickness and all
[26:54] matters of disease
[26:58] he had gathered his twelve warriors now
[27:01] he gathered called them and the bible
[27:03] said he gave them
[27:04] power where are we going to get our
[27:06] power from
[27:09] when we start another book about when
[27:12] the whole thing is when when the
[27:14] when the divine brings forth another
[27:16] branch who gives what power
[27:20] we are going to receive the power of the
[27:22] holy ghost like never before but what he
[27:26] said jesus would have to give it to them
[27:31] he says and gave them power against
[27:33] unclean spirits jesus to cast them out
[27:35] to you all manners of sickness and all
[27:36] manner of disease and now notice what he
[27:39] does in verse five
[27:40] these twelve these twelve jesus sent
[27:43] forth and commanded them saying go not
[27:44] into all the ways of the gentiles and
[27:46] into the house into any city the
[27:48] samaritans enter ye not but go rather to
[27:50] the lost sheep of the house of israel
[27:53] and as ye go preach saying the kingdom
[27:56] of heaven is at hand so notice how they
[27:59] are all saying the exact same thing one
[28:03] the bible says what the spirit and the
[28:05] bride will are saying they will say the
[28:07] same thing what's that word they say wow
[28:09] amen
[28:10] and those that hear it say come on
[28:12] [Applause]
[28:13] absolutely
[28:14] the spirit of the holy ghost will have
[28:16] the exact same message in every single
[28:19] messenger absolutely every single
[28:21] individual that was saying what the same
[28:23] thing now notice the unity the prophet
[28:26] god himself and then his disciples after
[28:29] have the same they're saying the same
[28:31] things amen amen yes
[28:35] how come we're hearing things
[28:37] that we're not said before
[28:39] in such a way i'll say like that
[28:45] he says but whoa he's as you go
[28:47] preaching the kingdom of heaven
[28:49] is at hand
[28:51] and not only preach he says what he says
[28:53] heal the sick
[28:55] cleanse the
[28:57] that was leprosy ever seen freely give
[29:00] absolutely man
[29:04] direct
[29:05] direct
[29:10] direct commands direct
[29:12] authority given
[29:14] to these people
[29:18] now notice what they do what do they
[29:19] have to do to perform this
[29:23] they just had to believe what he said
[29:26] amen amen
[29:29] they had to believe
[29:31] and have faith that what he said would
[29:34] take place hallelujah yes
[29:39] did they understand everything jesus
[29:40] said at this time
[29:44] absolutely not but what all they had to
[29:46] do was believe the simplicity of this
[29:49] hallelujah to preach this one thing
[29:53] and do these sort of things and have
[29:55] faith in it and it'll happen it'll have
[29:57] uh uh results hallelujah
[30:02] that's why what we can pray over the
[30:04] amen and he's gonna get well
[30:06] amen
[30:21] absolutely
[30:22] we have confidence in that
[30:25] now let's continue on here by god's
[30:27] grace
[30:30] in
[30:31] matthew
[30:32] 6
[30:35] 33 what did jesus say
[30:38] he says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[30:40] god in his righteousness and all these
[30:44] things shall be added unto you
[30:47] take no thought what shall we eat what
[30:50] shall we drink
[30:51] wherever shall we clothe
[30:54] eating drinking and clothing
[30:58] why he says because everyone needs these
[31:00] things and he said what the holy father
[31:03] knows you in need of these things but
[31:04] before those things can be added to you
[31:06] he says receive the holy you know why a
[31:08] lot of people don't get blessings
[31:11] are they tithed
[31:13] do they give offerings right
[31:15] are they giving alms
[31:17] and have they received the holy ghost
[31:20] first and received the holy ghost
[31:23] because he says seeking first holy ghost
[31:25] and his righteousness and these things
[31:28] all these things shall be added to you
[31:30] amen
[31:31] [Applause]
[31:35] right now
[31:36] pulling for money all the way for money
[31:38] pulling for money
[31:39] and i said brother wrestle maybe you
[31:41] should trust jesus
[31:43] and not me
[31:44] that's right right
[31:46] because when i have a need or however
[31:49] i just ask the lord jesus christ
[31:52] right right amen
[31:54] that's right brother
[31:57] 2.4 grade point average college
[32:01] dropout
[32:03] plumber
[32:05] the lowest of the trades
[32:08] right in the old sewer system
[32:10] and god can provide for me all right
[32:12] amen yes again absolutely
[32:15] now let's continue on
[32:20] now notice matthew 7 and 20
[32:23] jesus said wherefore by their fruits you
[32:25] shall know them not everyone that saith
[32:27] unto me
[32:28] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[32:30] of heaven
[32:35] just because they can identify that god
[32:37] is lord
[32:39] does not mean you'll enter in notice it
[32:41] has a saying that these guys see that
[32:43] these are baptized the correct way
[32:45] that they have thought that they teach
[32:47] wrong but the bible says what their
[32:48] workers are iniquity
[32:50] right knowing to do the right thing but
[32:52] not doing it
[32:54] sure now very simple absolutely sure
[32:57] now
[33:00] i'll notice about this in matthew 11 11
[33:03] verily i say unto you among them that
[33:05] are born of women that have not there
[33:06] has not risen a grave in the john the
[33:08] baptist
[33:09] not withstanding
[33:11] he said of all from adam
[33:14] all the way up
[33:15] oh wait he said what i'm sorry
[33:18] yeah from all of the born of woman so
[33:20] not adam
[33:22] right right good good from april
[33:25] yes good
[33:27] from
[33:28] abel
[33:30] there has not uh risen are greater than
[33:32] john the baptist
[33:35] he was the greatest
[33:36] that's right in god's own words he said
[33:38] this was the greatest that's right
[33:40] brother right
[33:41] god identified him as the greatest yes
[33:45] the holy ghost said
[33:47] he was the greatest amen
[33:50] that was standing he that is least in
[33:53] the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
[33:56] so saints of god as jesus will identify
[33:59] john the baptist and say he was the
[34:00] greatest man if you
[34:02] are in the kingdom of heaven you are now
[34:05] greater than him
[34:07] that's right okay right right now to
[34:09] think higher more higher than yourself
[34:10] then you should right but realize who
[34:13] you are because we must come to the
[34:15] point where we know who we
[34:19] did are identify john the baptist
[34:21] absolutely did the word of god
[34:23] prophesied john the baptist absolutely
[34:25] the the jesus speak of john the baptist
[34:29] absolutely is it recorded about him
[34:31] did god back up him absolutely yes what
[34:34] about you
[34:35] will god back up your words
[34:38] amen when you pray does god hear you
[34:41] yeah absolutely when god when god when
[34:43] you start weeping and crying for like
[34:46] that's the souls and the abominations of
[34:48] the city will god hear it absolutely
[34:50] hallelujah
[34:51] yes
[34:53] because you're greater
[34:56] now
[35:01] but what is the kingdom of heaven
[35:06] sister lena mike
[35:08] the king of heaven
[35:10] matthew 12. i don't know if you heard
[35:12] this before however
[35:13] you're kind of blue
[35:15] what is the kingdom of heaven
[35:18] matthew 12
[35:21] verse 26
[35:22] says if satan cast out satan he is
[35:24] divided against himself how shall then
[35:26] his kingdom stand and if i yells about
[35:29] cast out devils by whom your children
[35:31] cast them whom do your children cast
[35:32] them out for
[35:34] therefore they shall be your judges but
[35:36] if i cast out devils by the spirit of
[35:38] god
[35:39] he said that the kingdom of heaven is
[35:41] coming unto you
[35:43] yes
[35:44] so the kingdom of heaven is the holy
[35:47] ghost coming that's right yes amen
[35:50] hallelujah
[35:54] glory
[35:56] the holy spirit has come down for 2000
[36:00] years and has been
[36:02] here watching all things yes yes
[36:09] in luke 17 and 20.
[36:12] and when he was demanding the pharisees
[36:14] when the kingdom of god should come but
[36:16] they kept preaching and preaching the
[36:18] kingdom of comet the kingdom of heaven
[36:20] is here repent repent for the kingdom of
[36:22] heaven is here right
[36:23] he says the kingdom of heaven cometh not
[36:25] with observation neither shall they say
[36:27] no here or there for they can behold the
[36:30] kingdom of heaven is within
[36:33] america
[36:37] and the news would go around that
[36:39] something took place in acts 2 in
[36:41] jerusalem the holy ghost was spread out
[36:43] did that make roman news absolutely not
[36:47] he said before the prophet said he says
[36:49] one tenth of whatever the jews even knew
[36:50] jesus was alive what about these right
[36:52] here
[36:55] the next day after the after the day of
[36:56] pentecost uh
[36:58] uh hear you hear ye
[37:01] there's been something going on the
[37:03] christ has risen this and that and what
[37:04] his fears come down and now they're
[37:06] seeing this and this and 3 000 got
[37:08] baptized that was not in
[37:11] the daily news
[37:12] right
[37:13] because what it comes with not with
[37:15] observation
[37:17] amen
[37:20] can anyone pinpoint
[37:22] when every single one of us that have
[37:24] received the holy ghost when they
[37:26] received it
[37:28] do we know every single moment this and
[37:30] this this
[37:31] did i know that at certain point of time
[37:33] this brother or this sister was going to
[37:34] receive the holy ghost at that home we
[37:36] didn't know right what the holy ghost
[37:38] chooses
[37:43] and he prepares
[37:46] yes i want to i want to hit something
[37:48] here by god's grace i want to uh
[37:51] let's just jump here i want to hit this
[37:52] real quick here in john 3
[37:55] and 5.
[37:57] i know this is simple
[38:00] but it's coming down to this right here
[38:02] we must have that token we've got to be
[38:04] ready
[38:05] glory
[38:06] i i get nervous
[38:09] i'm like lord i've done everything i
[38:11] know how and i'm not seeing what i want
[38:13] to see before
[38:17] i'm not hearing your voice
[38:19] 100 clearly
[38:21] i'm not even to the point where i see
[38:23] visions or or those sort of things yet
[38:25] what is it
[38:26] lack of what i'll tell you this lack of
[38:28] consecration because i believe that we
[38:30] are supposed to see those things
[38:35] i just recently heard of an accident
[38:40] not saying anything negative or anything
[38:46] but could have the holy ghost spoken
[38:48] right through someone through tongues
[38:50] interpretation and warned of certain
[38:51] things right brother right
[38:54] i'm not saying anything negative but i'm
[38:56] saying
[38:58] we need more of the holy spirit
[39:02] in our lives amen amen amen
[39:06] remember if you remember that quote
[39:08] there's a quote or there is a recording
[39:11] of a speaking and tongues and
[39:12] interpretation in one of the sermons of
[39:14] nineteen blue is 1960
[39:16] and and the woman rose up and spoke in
[39:18] tongues and the holy ghost come down
[39:20] through a man and interpreted and he
[39:22] said he said what what did the holy
[39:23] spirit say he said at this time right
[39:25] now they are planning on the destruction
[39:27] of this this country he says in this
[39:29] same hour
[39:30] so while the prophet god was into
[39:33] preaching i believe 1916 when he deal
[39:35] with the church ages that at that time i
[39:38] believe it was a night time there he was
[39:39] preaching at that time in another
[39:41] country or somewhere in some secret
[39:42] little area they were already what they
[39:45] were planning at the exact same time the
[39:47] demise of this country
[39:49] right yes warning us
[39:51] and he showed many he said many things
[39:53] about what would come that we would just
[39:55] proclaim the name of jesus christ he
[39:57] will be with us amen amen thank you
[40:00] jesus hold up but uh
[40:02] we're taking time now let's continue on
[40:04] here
[40:05] john 3 and 5.
[40:09] jesus answered bear the bear is saying
[40:11] to thee except a man be born of water
[40:13] and of spirit he cannot enter into the
[40:15] kingdom of god
[40:18] born of the water
[40:20] and of the spirit
[40:22] he must get baptized
[40:24] or buried in the name of jesus christ
[40:26] and what he must then receive the
[40:28] baptism of the holy ghost
[40:30] yes a thousand times
[40:31] but this is the only way i know to enter
[40:35] into the kingdom of god that's right
[40:40] that which is born of flesh is flesh
[40:42] every one of us was born in flesh he
[40:44] says but when you've been born of the
[40:46] spirit it is now spirit amen capitalize
[40:50] he says marvel not that i say to me he
[40:52] must be born again
[40:55] right
[40:56] we know these things
[41:01] now let's continue on here i wanna i
[41:03] wanna hit this by the grace of god
[41:06] predestination go to matthew 13.
[41:19] by the time
[41:20] we
[41:21] catch this rapture
[41:24] this is going to be so
[41:26] evident
[41:27] okay
[41:29] because if you think about these
[41:30] scriptures here
[41:32] matthew 13 verse 1.
[41:35] the same day went jesus out of the house
[41:37] and sat by the sea side
[41:40] and great multitudes were gathered
[41:42] together unto him so that he went into a
[41:45] ship and sat and the whole multitude
[41:47] stood there on the shore and he spake
[41:49] many things to them and parables saying
[41:51] behold a sower went forth to sow
[41:54] all right
[41:55] so notice here is he's starting a
[41:56] parable and he said the sower went forth
[41:58] to sow what are the sower he's got a
[42:00] little satchel like johnny appleseed
[42:02] he's got season here and he's just
[42:04] starting to walk right
[42:06] he's got these seeds and he starts
[42:08] flinging these seeds into the air
[42:14] and they're landing pieces
[42:17] on different grounds right
[42:21] and when he sowed
[42:23] and when he sowed some seeds
[42:25] fell by the wayside and fouls came and
[42:28] the bowels let me tell you something
[42:29] saints
[42:32] why didn't the fowls devour the seeds up
[42:35] in your life
[42:36] that's right right amen
[42:38] hallelujah
[42:40] that's right
[42:41] because there is no one
[42:44] to drive the spouse away
[42:48] [Music]
[42:51] how come
[42:54] no one drove the piles away on those
[42:56] grounds
[42:57] that's right
[43:00] who wasn't there
[43:03] why was the ground in that condition
[43:06] that's right
[43:09] some fell upon stony places well there's
[43:12] not much earth and therefore they sprung
[43:14] up because they have no definite
[43:16] deafness of earth
[43:17] why were there stones in that ground
[43:21] why wasn't that ground broke up more so
[43:23] it could go deeper in
[43:26] yes
[43:32] and when the sun was up
[43:34] they were scorched because they had no
[43:35] root
[43:36] and withered away
[43:40] some fell among the thorns and thorns
[43:42] sprung up and choked them out
[43:45] who let thorns grow up in that ground
[44:02] amen
[44:03] and brought forth fruit some 100 some 60
[44:06] fold some 30-fold who has ears on him
[44:08] here amen yeah
[44:10] amen saints of god any
[44:12] good
[44:13] fun
[44:16] why is parable 1 and parable 2 in
[44:19] matthew 13 about farming
[44:24] because it's it's bringing forth the
[44:26] seed or the word of god
[44:29] and it's what but remember that good
[44:31] ground had to be prepared
[44:37] what i'm saying is everything is
[44:39] predestinating that's right
[44:42] yes sir yes sir
[44:46] brother why are why why were you able to
[44:48] hear this
[44:49] word
[44:50] why were you able to catch the

[45:57] why
[45:59] would this sower throw that seed into
[46:01] bad places

[46:04] opportunity to give them the exact same
[46:07] seed
[46:08] yes
[46:09] the exact same seed that you let grow
[46:12] that you euler grow the unit grow that
[46:14] we all have threat that we that we
[46:16] caught and we're trying to produce what
[46:19] 30 60 100 yeah trying to produce this
[46:22] and letting all of us yield and produce
[46:24] these things yes but he gave the exact
[46:26] same opportunity to these other grounds
[46:29] yes he did
[46:32] what is it luke 8 15
[46:35] but then on the good ground are they
[46:37] which is an honest and good heart who
[46:40] gave you an honest and good heart
[46:43] hallelujah
[46:44] everything is predestinated
[46:47] and in that honest and good heart if you
[46:49] get the correct c now notice it must be
[46:52] the correct c yeah should not be a
[46:54] denominational
[47:10] [Applause]
[47:15] [Music]
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:23] word will never use 30 60 and a hundred
[47:26] folders
[47:28] do it hallelujah
[47:31] glory
[47:33] what is this
[47:35] this is the beginning
[47:37] if it started out with the right seed
[47:40] falling on the right heart yes it must
[47:43] end up it must have a restoration of the
[47:46] right seed on the right heart it will
[47:49] produce a hundred fold
[47:52] [Applause]
[47:56] except those that had the right seed and
[47:58] their right ground
[47:59] hallelujah
[48:01] who are you
[48:04] you are the bride of jesus christ amen
[48:07] if you receive the baptism of the holy
[48:09] ghost because you heard the correct word
[48:12] amen
[48:14] the restoration of the word of god has
[48:16] come
[48:17] yes we now
[48:22] [Applause]
[48:24] right and it's a little scissor seed
[48:26] it's seed form
[48:28] but remember you take a little apple
[48:29] seed
[48:30] break down the genetics
[48:33] it just goes infinity
[48:35] we don't know how many apples are in
[48:36] that seed
[48:41] how many revelations are in this right
[48:46] or in this
[48:52] more and more truths are coming out of
[48:54] this ways to prove all things amen yeah
[48:59] absolutely
[49:00] glory if you want to know what an apple
[49:03] makes of an apple you got to look inside
[49:05] the seed and prove that this is an apple
[49:07] that what's inside that apple seed will
[49:09] peru will prove it's an apple that's
[49:11] right if you look into this it'll prove
[49:14] if you're a christian amen yeah
[49:17] praise god
[49:20] amen
[49:25] praise the lord
[49:27] now
[49:35] when dealing with matthew 13 we've
[49:36] always taught
[49:38] original sin through there second
[49:40] parable second interpretation right
[49:44] and the prophet god would pick up
[49:47] you know he's dealing with the original
[49:48] sin in the church book
[49:50] he says these illustrations
[49:52] depict perfect perfectly the parable of
[49:55] the lord jesus christ when he said the
[49:57] kingdom of heaven was likened unto a man
[49:59] that sowed good seed he says only to
[50:01] have an enemy comet plant tares amongst
[50:04] those good
[50:05] seeds
[50:07] he said god did not plant those cares
[50:10] those serpents in genesis 1.
[50:12] we're not these servants in genesis 3.
[50:16] i'll say this genesis 4.
[50:18] not the same serpents
[50:20] i was like this they had an upgrade
[50:23] and we had a downgrade
[50:26] but he's liking he's just lacking that
[50:28] parable he says back to the original
[50:32] but then we see
[50:34] later on the resume of the church ages
[50:36] in the church
[50:38] book what does he say
[50:41] something phenomenal
[50:43] he says and that age heading the scene
[50:45] of truth and the seed of air exactly is
[50:48] set forth according to the parable of
[50:50] the wheat and tears and what he said he
[50:52] says the church ages is the field
[50:56] amen yes yeah
[51:00] because remember
[51:03] in matthew 13 all these parables are
[51:05] parables of the kingdom of heaven that's
[51:07] right
[51:08] and if the kingdom of heaven is the holy
[51:10] ghost and every one of these parables
[51:12] must be what a parable of
[51:14] the new testament church
[51:17] right
[51:18] sure
[51:19] he says the church
[51:21] ages is the field jesus and in it are
[51:24] the wheat and tears the false church
[51:25] organized humanized the government the
[51:27] word and father true christian
[51:30] church amen
[51:31] now we see that in the scriptures
[51:35] but now as it gets oh
[51:37] let me read this real quick
[51:38] also on the resume he says
[51:40] terrors always flourish mightier than
[51:43] wheat
[51:44] or any cultivated plant
[51:47] the tare church grew rapidly in this
[51:49] first age and the wee church was
[51:51] flourished also
[51:57] in other words
[52:00] why is it going to be so dark
[52:02] at the coming of the lord
[52:05] because there will be so many levels
[52:08] of deception
[52:10] yeah yes it'll go so deep thanks of god
[52:14] let's just ask our pastor here oh jesse
[52:16] where will be the darkest
[52:18] the most deceptive
[52:20] teaching in the world
[52:24] it'll be in the message of the hour that
[52:27] will be
[52:28] matthew 24 24. that'll be so close to
[52:31] the scene they're very elected right
[52:33] mm-hmm
[52:35] is trinity gonna
[52:36] is that gonna fool anyone no sir
[52:39] but jesse we could just say
[52:41] youtube hey but jesse's sermons videos
[52:43] there on trinity seven problems trinity
[52:46] that's not going to deceive us no sir
[52:49] not even close good
[52:51] that's right
[52:55] but what about some of these message
[52:56] doctrines that are coming up right
[52:58] jesse's teaching
[53:06] are those those are a lot more closer of
[53:09] deceiving
[53:10] message people or people that hurt
[53:18] that's going to be way more deceptive
[53:20] why because we've heard the true word we
[53:22] understand those things
[53:24] yeah now my intellection by intellect is
[53:27] good we can understand those things we
[53:28] can teach those things by internet
[53:29] absolutely but it becomes to come to a
[53:31] time where it's revelation yes where it
[53:34] cannot be untaught right that's right
[53:37] right
[53:39] we know people yeah who are right there
[53:41] with us
[53:42] sister
[53:45] this is the original sin is amazing okay
[53:47] the king was not of the god
[53:49] first john three and 20.
[53:52] and they taught serpenty their entire
[53:54] for 20 years right brother right
[53:57] in a matter of one year
[53:59] they cannot see it
[54:01] was that intellect
[54:03] or was that revelation
[54:07] that's right
[54:08] right because by natural just by basic
[54:12] intellect into intelligence
[54:15] and by looking at it with an honest
[54:16] heart even honest i'll say it like that
[54:18] without his heart looking at it saying
[54:20] wow that's right
[54:22] right identifying that is right
[54:26] but did he really
[54:28] did the catch hole deep down
[54:30] right brother
[54:35] but jesse can you defend
[54:36] certain absolutely absolutely the male
[54:40] guy can you defend service team
[54:42] absolutely
[54:44] and if you can't you can come to me
[54:48] we'll stand right in front of you even
[54:49] they'll look at you because you're
[54:50] taller than me and still be able to see
[54:52] you but i'll be right there
[54:56] with my with the word drawn ready to go
[54:58] that's right amen
[55:02] but remember there will be more false
[55:06] then there will be true
[55:08] yes
[55:09] corinthians paul said he says there is
[55:11] right now more teaching false than there
[55:13] are truths
[55:15] yes yes amen
[55:19] i was just on youtube
[55:20] just you know things come up on your
[55:22] feet
[55:25] and and a brother was over here some not
[55:27] not message just a christian was trying
[55:28] to defend it
[55:30] uh two hollywood stars they broke up and
[55:32] they're married and how he needs to go
[55:34] back here they need to get back together
[55:35] this this and i'm thinking
[55:37] this lady here has already been married
[55:39] four times
[55:41] and he said by scripture they're
[55:42] supposed to i was like dude
[55:44] she if anyone she should be gathered
[55:46] back to her first husband
[55:48] right
[55:49] but they're just abs and everybody's
[55:51] everybody's all great great great study
[55:53] brother good blah blah blah blah great
[55:54] phenomenal
[55:56] completely blind right brother right
[55:59] completely void of the understanding
[56:02] of the word of god yes sir
[56:05] amen now
[56:07] in isaiah 54 1 it says he says for more
[56:10] are the children of the desolate than
[56:12] the children of the mary wife saith the
[56:14] lord
[56:16] there's going to be so many more tears
[56:18] in this hour that's why it's going to be
[56:21] so
[56:22] dark right right brother the bible talks
[56:25] about what a famine in the land for what
[56:27] the hearing of the word of god that's
[56:33] [Music]
[56:36] but notice in
[56:37] matthew 13 verse 24 another parable he
[56:40] put forth on him saying the kingdom of
[56:41] heaven is lightened to a man which
[56:42] showed good seed in his field but notice
[56:45] this is a kingdom of heaven is lagging
[56:47] unto a man which showed good seeing his
[56:48] feelings but while men slept
[56:51] his enemy came and sowed tears with
[56:53] wheat so this revelation while men slept
[56:55] must be a new testament revelation right
[57:01] what is the sleeping
[57:04] when they pass on that's right yes yes
[57:08] so when the new testament
[57:11] apostles
[57:12] peter
[57:14] james
[57:15] john
[57:16] matthew phillip
[57:19] all these
[57:20] stephen stone
[57:21] as they would fall asleep
[57:24] he said then what the tares then would
[57:26] come in
[57:29] but what would terrors do
[57:32] what do terrors do what was the
[57:33] nicknames in the clintons
[57:34] this is what this is what broke up the
[57:36] spirit of god among remember the
[57:38] anointed
[57:40] the brotherhood everybody's dwelling in
[57:42] unity
[57:44] everybody is in love with one another oh
[57:48] and a great sister with a great brother
[57:49] oh brother
[57:51] is there anything i can do for you today
[57:52] god
[57:56] and what that's what god wanted to see
[57:59] in heaven amen
[58:00] with the holy ghost
[58:01] amen
[58:02] yes
[58:04] one by one
[58:06] the pillars in the church would pass and
[58:08] fall asleep
[58:11] and the ones who had the full revelation
[58:14] of what divine love is among ones
[58:16] another one another
[58:18] as they would fall asleep the antichrist
[58:20] fear would come in and start polluting
[58:23] the true church of god see
[58:25] watch out for your brother
[58:29] and now i planted something in her mind
[58:33] all right
[58:37] and now he would separate from him
[58:39] and that displeases the holy ghost and
[58:43] the holy spirit starts lifting
[58:46] all right
[58:47] instead of sister lydia saying
[58:50] brother you shouldn't say that moment
[58:57] you better have some proof
[58:59] but what what was she doing she had the
[59:01] holy ghost which i believe she knew
[59:03] she'd say she would go immediately say
[59:06] brother are you are you serious and
[59:08] she'll go and confront her
[59:09] say hey
[59:10] is what he's saying true
[59:13] of course it's not true
[59:15] they can be
[59:16] brother and sister
[59:27] it is a separation of the people of god
[59:31] it is it is aiming
[59:33] the sons of god the daughters of god
[59:35] against each other
[59:36] right right
[59:38] because remember when this thing comes
[59:40] prophesied that what the
[59:42] children of god will be able to discern
[59:43] the true spirits within the framework
[59:45] that's it amen yes
[59:50] we are going to pick up
[59:52] it is and then what the prophet is only
[59:54] the holy ghost field would be able to
[59:55] detect that there's a quote they will
[59:58] only
[1:00:00] that's right these things amen
[1:00:03] amen yes that's absolutely the truth
[1:00:06] right
[1:00:07] now
[1:00:10] i don't know how long i've helped you
[1:00:12] but i want to i want to
[1:00:14] maybe list an ending here let me jump
[1:00:16] let me jump to this uh
[1:00:22] can you hook me up onto the old uh
[1:00:39] saints of
[1:00:40] god jesse just said you guys have been
[1:00:43] in the assembly here
[1:00:47] your pastor
[1:00:48] has sent out thousands
[1:00:51] of invitations
[1:00:53] coming to hear the original seed
[1:00:57] that word of god that was preached from
[1:00:59] the beginning
[1:01:01] he has
[1:01:02] sent out seeds like a soul
[1:01:05] and these scenes have fallen upon every
[1:01:08] the exact same kind of grounds
[1:01:11] that was prophesied
[1:01:13] right right
[1:01:18] and we know we're at the coming lord
[1:01:20] and literally this is
[1:01:22] all right now that we know they've heard
[1:01:24] the word of god and god has what added
[1:01:27] to his church daily in this area
[1:01:30] yes
[1:01:33] and we are the same in the point what
[1:01:35] well we're just a small little tiny
[1:01:37] church
[1:01:38] does god really love us this is this
[1:01:40] absolutely amazing hallelujah you are
[1:01:43] the apple of his eye you are the you're
[1:01:46] the reason these scenes were was
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:50] there you go you are the ones that this
[1:01:54] is going to produce the exact same thing
[1:01:56] no other angle
[1:01:58] no other age
[1:02:00] was given the restoration
[1:02:02] luther did not get this restoration
[1:02:04] that's right right give me the part of
[1:02:06] it
[1:02:07] wesley did not get this restoration all
[1:02:09] right so it was a part of it
[1:02:12] another move the true move of god
[1:02:14] pentecostalism
[1:02:17] of god they did not get the restoration
[1:02:19] of the word right we were given it what
[1:02:22] is that showing
[1:02:24] he's back to
[1:02:26] planting seeds again
[1:02:30] so what's going to prove all
[1:02:33] the things
[1:02:36] is literally election
[1:02:39] now jesus is back
[1:02:41] for the last 50 60 70 years
[1:02:44] planting the same seed that was in the
[1:02:47] beginning
[1:02:48] and as all those who can receive the
[1:02:51] word of god
[1:02:53] because what god has to prepare our
[1:02:55] hearts
[1:02:56] yes when i was in
[1:02:58] college i was an atheist i was science
[1:03:00] teacher they switched me in one year
[1:03:04] from semi-christian believing god
[1:03:05] baptized right before you to an atheist
[1:03:09] four years believing not in god i was
[1:03:11] going to be scientists this evolution
[1:03:13] evolution evolution science evolution
[1:03:15] papers
[1:03:18] and then god had the break
[1:03:22] and then he started preparing my heart
[1:03:25] started getting why did he pull them
[1:03:27] thorns out
[1:03:28] why did he take out the stonyness of my
[1:03:31] heart why why did he give me a little
[1:03:33] bit more dirt
[1:03:34] than being thin on top
[1:03:36] yeah
[1:03:37] he prepared the heart
[1:03:40] for the seed
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:45] for the seed
[1:03:47] now look back into your lives
[1:03:50] look what you once were
[1:03:53] what did you what did you have to go
[1:03:55] through before you heard the word of god
[1:03:58] he had to get to the point where you are
[1:04:00] hungry for the word of god
[1:04:03] where you were like lord show me the
[1:04:06] truth
[1:04:08] yes
[1:04:09] i was the
[1:04:17] god sends the exact same scene as he
[1:04:21] connects to back to what you amen
[1:04:25] yes to produce hallelujah
[1:04:30] what they produce back there that's
[1:04:31] right amen will it well brother i don't
[1:04:34] see a hundred fold yet
[1:04:35] it doesn't matter it said it would
[1:04:37] produce it
[1:04:40] amen now
[1:04:43] in closing
[1:04:46] we're gonna do a little family history
[1:04:47] is that okay
[1:04:49] it might be a little personal here for
[1:04:51] some but uh
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:04:56] i'm going to tell you a story in closing
[1:05:03] now notice here
[1:05:05] whosoever was born of god did not commit
[1:05:07] sin for his seed
[1:05:09] remaineth in him
[1:05:11] who is his seed
[1:05:13] for his seed remains in him that's god's
[1:05:16] own life that's the holy ghost in you
[1:05:19] remaining there and god only sees that
[1:05:22] that's right not this
[1:05:26] if you receive the holy ghost
[1:05:29] you can he cannot sin because he is born
[1:05:32] of god
[1:05:35] but god no no think of this
[1:05:38] in the spiritual
[1:05:40] god's looking your life
[1:05:44] but what does he see first he sees this
[1:05:46] fail
[1:05:47] he sees his body with six thousand years
[1:05:49] worth of sin
[1:05:51] compiled
[1:05:52] like bank interest right in here
[1:05:56] nothing but filth there is no there's

[1:06:21] affections that are not correct
[1:06:24] ideas conscience all those things

[1:08:58] my great grandpa
[1:09:00] was a master wheat farmer
[1:09:04] he knew how to set the rose
[1:09:07] and he was a farmer
[1:09:08] and he only planted wheat
[1:09:14] notice
[1:09:15] we just love the pups
[1:09:17] right
[1:09:18] flying live or something that's my
[1:09:20] grandpa
[1:09:21] grandpa frank
[1:09:22] now as time would go on in america
[1:09:25] less and less farming became less and
[1:09:27] less
[1:09:29] gave you the
[1:09:30] sustainability to live and to prosper
[1:09:32] okay
[1:09:34] my grandpa frank
[1:09:37] not one did he farm and my dad said he
[1:09:39] was a good farmer
[1:09:43] but he had to do stuff on the side he
[1:09:44] built houses and sold him he took land
[1:09:46] and built houses and sold them he did
[1:09:48] rentals and those things so he had to
[1:09:50] farm and
[1:09:51] work on the side just to make things
[1:09:53] made to make things
[1:09:56] pay his bills
[1:10:01] now his son
[1:10:03] was my dad
[1:10:04] but jesse's dad
[1:10:07] and my dad was a baby the baby of the
[1:10:09] family and
[1:10:12] by the time time my dad grew up
[1:10:15] my grandpa
[1:10:16] my grandpa had already quit farming
[1:10:20] because he was older
[1:10:21] and he went to work in a factory
[1:10:23] so my dad never learned
[1:10:26] how to farm properly
[1:10:29] okay
[1:10:32] i don't know if jesse remembers this but
[1:10:34] my dad working at gm
[1:10:36] he had a dream
[1:10:38] and he knew a farmer
[1:10:40] i can't remember his name right now but
[1:10:43] and my dad would drive by this farmer
[1:10:45] and one time he was driving by in the
[1:10:47] farmer that he lived by an old gate
[1:10:49] there he was parked on the side of the
[1:10:50] road and he seen him out walking and
[1:10:52] there was one weed in his field
[1:10:56] and my dad waited for him to come up
[1:10:58] gertzweiler henry getzweil
[1:11:00] he said henry
[1:11:02] why did you walk out in that field to
[1:11:03] get that one weed
[1:11:05] and he said snook he said
[1:11:07] if i don't get if i don't find out what
[1:11:10] kind of weed this is
[1:11:11] because he said by next year
[1:11:13] if i don't find the right concoction of
[1:11:16] pesticide to kill this one weed
[1:11:19] by next year that thing will be all
[1:11:20] through this
[1:11:21] and my dad said
[1:11:26] and this man henry gersheiler
[1:11:29] he bought he built five farms for each
[1:11:32] one of his sons
[1:11:33] and he was able to give him a farm to
[1:11:35] each one of his sons
[1:11:37] and they're all now farmers and home
[1:11:38] beach still
[1:11:40] very wise man
[1:11:42] now my dad
[1:11:44] though he came from a long line of
[1:11:46] farmers
[1:11:47] was not taught how to farm correctly and
[1:11:49] my dad had that same dream as well
[1:11:52] you can tell but jesse and me i've
[1:11:54] always wanted to be a farmer and he
[1:11:55] always he watches right now if you go to
[1:11:57] his house
[1:11:58] you get on his iphone
[1:12:01] his iphone is nothing but farm videos
[1:12:07] from the one with the steel tractor
[1:12:09] tires
[1:12:12] it's the big big bud
[1:12:15] spent some time with my dad
[1:12:18] wow and my dad had a dream one time
[1:12:22] because we're going to gm not a dream
[1:12:23] but he had he ended up he wanted to do
[1:12:25] the same thing henry gertzweiler did
[1:12:27] for his boys he wanted to give us each a
[1:12:29] farm
[1:12:30] and he went and bought an old raggedy
[1:12:32] house with about 10 acres
[1:12:35] and i remember going in bro jess i don't
[1:12:36] know if you remember going to that house
[1:12:39] he took us to this really beat up house
[1:12:41] i remember looking in i'm just going and
[1:12:42] my mom was not happy because i watched
[1:12:44] your face and he's like
[1:12:46] ruby we're gonna move here we're gonna
[1:12:48] set this we're gonna get this farm going
[1:12:49] this and that and i'm just like
[1:12:53] well my dad worked at gm
[1:12:55] after work he would go farming
[1:12:59] and i planted my dad planted only wheat
[1:13:04] but he was not a very good farmer
[1:13:06] because he did not have training
[1:13:10] and by the time it came for harvest
[1:13:15] he looked into his field
[1:13:19] and he couldn't find he couldn't see any
[1:13:21] wheat there was so
[1:13:23] many
[1:13:25] weeds
[1:13:28] now my dad was very poor or
[1:13:30] he did not have a combine
[1:13:32] so he had to pay he brought another
[1:13:34] farmer up and said hey could you combine
[1:13:36] this for me
[1:13:37] and the other farmer gets up there and
[1:13:38] he's like
[1:13:39] are you sure there's something in there
[1:13:42] are you sure there's any wheat
[1:13:45] and my dad said
[1:13:46] there's wheat in there
[1:13:49] will you harvest harvest it for me
[1:13:51] in the paint mops
[1:13:53] and the guy said i'll do it he says are
[1:13:55] you sure i don't waste my time dad said
[1:13:57] there's wheat
[1:13:59] in there
[1:14:05] farmer got on his combine
[1:14:08] and as he was going through all
[1:14:10] that field
[1:14:16] guess what he had
[1:14:18] of all those weeds
[1:14:22] there was still wheat in there
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:28] one farmer
[1:14:29] could not see anything good
[1:14:32] in that field
[1:14:35] there was so
[1:14:37] many
[1:14:38] false impersonational seeds in that
[1:14:42] field right
[1:14:46] because my dad was not the best farmer
[1:14:49] now jesus christ is a tremendous farmer
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:55] but i'll tell you what when he leaves
[1:14:57] his own children there to keep the field
[1:15:01] and they quit leaning on god
[1:15:05] and go to their own wisdom they became
[1:15:08] bad farmers
[1:15:09] and they let the tares come on in right
[1:15:13] and 2 000 years
[1:15:15] as christ would send the reapers in
[1:15:23] good master
[1:15:24] are you sure there's wheat in there
[1:15:28] we're right at the end of laodicea
[1:15:32] jesus is there your children still there
[1:15:35] all
[1:15:36] right amen
[1:15:39] combines boys
[1:15:42] because there's a weed in there
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:58] right nothing but serpent seed all
[1:16:01] around you nothing but tears all around
[1:16:04] you and he's going to send his reapers
[1:16:07] in yes
[1:16:09] that's right and let me say like this
[1:16:12] he actually separates at that time it's
[1:16:15] okay to separate the wheat from the
[1:16:18] tares because when all these tears are
[1:16:21] bundled he can stand out and say right
[1:16:23] there's my wheat right there that's
[1:16:24] right amen amen amen
[1:16:28] god knows the bible says what he has
[1:16:31] this seal
[1:16:33] yes
[1:16:35] nevertheless the foundation of god
[1:16:37] standeth sure
[1:16:39] yeah having this seal the notice the
[1:16:42] lord knows them that are his
[1:16:46] thanks to god amen
[1:16:47] might be a church that is so small the
[1:16:50] only one standing for the true word of
[1:16:52] god in this area right even accurate
[1:16:55] however
[1:16:58] by the natural eye someone could say a
[1:17:01] christian i'll say a real holy ghost
[1:17:02] christian
[1:17:04] from germany from russia from wherever
[1:17:06] fly right here and say there ain't no
[1:17:08] seat here
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:41] hallelujah
[1:17:55] glory remember you are the wheat god
[1:17:59] every small detail about your life is
[1:18:02] watching
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:05] we can get in communion real yes
[1:18:09] communion with him
[1:18:12] your very harsh desires will be
[1:18:15] fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah he
[1:18:18] promised he said
[1:18:20] yes
[1:18:21] and as this darkness continues to get
[1:18:23] darker
[1:18:24] and darker saints of god
[1:18:27] this will get brighter
[1:18:29] yes
[1:18:31] hallelujah they remember something we
[1:18:33] never thought we would ever see you
[1:18:34] today ten years ago that's right
[1:18:37] where they'd be teaching boys to be
[1:18:39] girls and girls will be boys that's
[1:18:40] right never thought we see that day
[1:18:43] what if
[1:18:44] god gives us 10 more
[1:18:46] right what are we going to see
[1:18:49] boys robots girls are robots

[1:18:55] what's next
[1:18:57] saints of god this
[1:18:59] will give us
[1:19:01] the answers hallelujah and if we ask the
[1:19:03] holy ghost to lead us and show us in the
[1:19:06] word and i'll say like this
[1:19:09] the most important thing right now is
[1:19:11] refilling
[1:19:12] after refilling if they had the if they
[1:19:14] had acts 2
[1:19:16] and what a couple days later they needed
[1:19:18] a refilling
[1:19:20] what about today
[1:19:23] in a darker hour
[1:19:25] compared to 2 000 years ago
[1:19:29] this is a very serious check of time i'm
[1:19:31] feeling
[1:19:32] god helpless
[1:19:33] hallelujah
[1:19:42] but just remember all three generations
[1:19:44] of my
[1:19:46] line there they all wanted to see they
[1:19:48] planted seed they wanted the best
[1:19:51] hallelujah and we not might not be the
[1:19:54] best right now about farming
[1:19:57] but we are going to be at the end we're
[1:20:00] going to show we're going to be able to
[1:20:02] produce the wheat hallelujah what is in
[1:20:06] that seed gene will come out
[1:20:09] because remember that's that sea gene
[1:20:11] has been joined now to his seed which is
[1:20:13] the holy ghost and that holy ghost will
[1:20:15] quicken it will perform at its given
[1:20:18] time yes
[1:20:19] it is alive so let's bow our heads
