========================================

praise God worse can do it Bible study tonight brother Jose it's nice to see you sir it's the start of the school year how some boats gotta get a lot of stress at the start of the school year and so if we do a whole service that means extra singing on my voice and so I lose my voice really quick I'm preaching really loud and overly emotional you lose my voice not fast and it's really hard for me to teach the next day you know my day at school thankfully we got tomorrow off so we have actually day to recover but most Monday's we don't have I'd like to just do some Iowa Studies with the children you know and even adults that they have any question that it's like do some Bible studies to take them through the scriptures my wife and I were talking about when we first came the message brother Craig was there and he just made himself fully available to sit down and take us through any topic in the scripture that was some of the most important times because we got our founding right in the scripture for example you know we're just to say like we our foundation was in the word first not some people do clothes first which is it's different however however you come to God is wonderful however you come but we were taught the word first and then once we did the word then we would list another brand of it see what he said so we felt that was a great foundation for us we're very thankful for that so to save a little bit of energy and to do some teaching with the children we wanted to do some Bible studies brother Branham said you know we're gonna be put a church but we need to get down to the Holy Ghost so the most important thing is to teach in justification significations baptism holding those programs that that was my message he sent my message of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost so I want to do a little Bible study on safe vacation today and I just hit a few scriptures and I got some visuals just to show the children here will I like to just start with the word of Prayer so let's look at sanctification I want to look at it at the angle that the prophet taught it with growing up into the virtues of God or look at at that angle so pretty gonna be familiar with that and anytime you have a question girls you can raise your hand any time even adults if you have any questions let's talk thanks that brother BAE so the man if you were your wife have any questions about sanctification anytime you know just wanna you know raise your hand we'll try to answer the best we camp on the scripture we can even search quotes to I think I could even yeah I can switch easily over to quotes and look up quotes we just find the key words let's start off with what is sanctification so I want to start with that and then we'll look at some scriptures about sanctification so you can see in the italicized words back there such an AV off right authorized version the word sanctification is also used holiness five times and sanctification five times of the King James Version and so those are the two means their consecration purification and sanctification of heart and life so the purifying of your life okay by God's standard we think it's really important to have a purified life yeah Esther says yes yes yeah it's very important to have a purified life that means pure all sin pure from all evil habits I remember a few months ago I was preaching on the Holy Ghost series and your mommy sister Kristin 78 or send me an email afterwards and I preached a message on laboring for the Holy Ghost and sister Kristin 70 nice to email saying that was a wonderful industry for our service because brother branham said sanctification is like labor it's hard work everybody know what hard work is where you feel like you're tired everything being tired sometimes sanctification is tiring because you're trying to overcome you trying to work really hard to let God flow through your life so can we take a deep breath in sometimes in sanctification you got to reflect yourself and keep fighting keep battling in order to have the right kind of behaviors like obedience to the Holy Spirit so I wanted to say this to sanctification is the will of God before you receive the Holy Ghost and after so we know it actually never edits but there's a certain level of sanctification ee before God will fill you with the Holy Spirit and his Spirit will guide you into that so let's read these scriptures so I have Lydia Malachi know they can read right away acacia Liddy why don't you get 17 17 Malachi first ISIL needs fourth I'll help you verses 1 through 8 in acacia you have verse nestlings 523 I can help you with that solonius actually like that this morning a little bit when we preached on that so as we said it's the will of God before so the first one is that Jesus is praying for the disciples and this is before he died so he was still like that before he was crucified and one of his last prayers for them is that God would sanctify them they'd already been with him three half years they saw miracle after miracle after miracle but still haven't received the Holy Ghost so it's important that no matter how many miracles we see no matter how much ministry we do we want to make sure we have the power in life that the Holy Spirit gives us which Paul said is Christ in you reject want to see Christ living in u.s. see Christ amen I don't see Christ living through me Jesse Smith but I don't think Jesus Christ lived through me so let it read John 17:17 thank you just a minute here I know mothers can't hear I used this I'm Lydia can you read that again like the mothers here thank you so Jesus learned his last prayers he's praying for his disciples his father will you sanctify them will you purify them even more through your truth through the word so here's how we get purified right here through the Word of God okay so Malachi 1st Thessalonians 4 1 through 8 I should have been coldness the whole time because I don't think I don't think they can hear in there unless I really hold this so make sure you gotta hold this the whole time so let me turn there 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 1 verse 4 okay summary verses 1 into an Amalekite you can read verse 3 yeah furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so you would abound more and more to see how we want to please God more and more no bag and I have been together for many years now since 2002 and our lives that's what 15 years so our life should have more and more pleasing God you shouldn't always please God less and get back into sin we should please him more and more verse 2 for ye know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus so you're not and you recurse hope they'll stretch even your sanctification you should abstain from fornication all right thank you so you never say we'll have gotten ready we don't love God it is God's perfect will we've got to be sanctified we've got to be cured by pure from evil pure from sin we got to be that way it's God's will God wants that for Esther Acacia Haman God wants it for all of us to be pure from sin okay I'll reverse for that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concoctions even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any manner because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such and we also have forewarned you and testified for God has not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness God has called you so God's kind of like appeared in heaven calling you say Malachi Lydia can she come up here higher come up here to holiness holiness is a state of life right it's a state of your spiritual walk he's calling us he's saying to come up higher come up here like in our knee right further up and further in he's saying come up come up higher I'm calling you up here you don't you don't want to live way down there you know life that has sin and defilement you want to live in a life that's pure come up here he's inviting us up higher verse 8 he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but God who hath also given unto us His Holy Spirit indication how do you feel about that person reprocessing five point three and I'll give you the mic Thank You Darla wonderful so Paul woods pray that God would sanctify us all the way in all three parts our bodies swords here all three hearts were pure the floor God isn't that beautiful so even after even before you receive the Holy Ghost you need sanctify and then after we continually need sanctified more purified to God's purpose welcome nature if you look up there on the screen brother branham talk we can know where we are at in God at any time how'd he do that brother I've said that he said God is there he's the guy who Amen he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast he does it and is done forever none can take away from what he says or add to it so let it be amen he said so let it be aren't you glad that you served that kind of God you could know exactly where you are with him at any time and all the time isn't that beautiful at any time and all the time you can know my pleasing to God am i walking with God am i being more sanctified you could know where you are with God at any time he is the Amen and he won't change I give you a few examples of this I preach this a few weeks ago as I was with Moses remember this brother Graham says he's ending the sermon he says that I've accomplished more this morning by the message that I've had and the things that I've known of I've followed the Commission more than I've accomplished in the last five years because I found the center of God's will this is a wonderful location brother ran in 1960 said I found the center of God's will because he was putting too much emphasis on the gifts and says it said of his commission of praying for the sick he was challenging people to bring up you know the hardest cases who's putting too much emphasis on the sides instead of the Commission but now he says I found the center of God's will now if the extremes of God's will well further this way or further that way but the center of God's will can you know what can you know where you are with God at any time sure for the bread of knew he said I'm right where I need to be at the center of God's will here's another one the RAM said people didn't love me at all nobody had any use for me but now by the help of God I believe I'm directing the bride of Jesus Christ he wasn't in the background with other people he was directing he was the one telling the bride members all about the Word of God he used a director you children you been to a symphony right and you know you can recognize the director right away right you should all one the standing up right how else can you tell standing up and what else does the director do then the pinch I've noticed you the director at the band concerts you know when I'm at school he'll point to certain people and it's their time to come in and he'll point to them and so from the band he knew he's at the center of God's will he knew was he was the director of God's bride of the whole people of God here's another one one time in 1965 brother Graham said he said Lord show me my ministry in the Bible and he said I closed my eyes and just let the Bible follow but you want to know where he was with God at that moment and guess what he found Genesis 24 verse 7 which was Eliezer God's I'm sorry Abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the Bible being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac he said chills run all over me sure that's right that's right with the rest of my message pulling of the bride so can everybody see how brother Branham knew where he was with God you think you can know where you are with God of course yes wonderful all right now remember there are three stages to perfection right God's got to take us through three stages remember the judgment of this slide for let me preach some book as it can the three three bodies okay man has three stages justification sanctification that's where I'm talking about today everything has three stages to perfection who knows the three bodies in another three bodies video okay's yeah closed this is speaking of the three bodies like terrestrial you know the next one celeste yield and glorify remember those three bodies everything's in threes right the earth goes through three stages until it's perfect your it goes through water what's next clubs blood and then entire that's to come the fire baptism what the birth with our eyes already had water blood the next is fire the baby when a baby's born under usual circumstances burst the water breaks then there's a bloody show and then at the spirit of the bait that uses the baby comes out in Christ you see the baby like the bride the Prophet talked went through Luther then went through Wesley and then the third mint messenger to restore the bride or bring perfection of the bride was the grams Mitch thought save the Lord prophetic ministry okay here's another one the gifts there's three gifts the Prophet said eight hope what's the last one hope and charity these three the body the Godhead has three stages to perfection who knows those father three stages God is always perfected and then the plant goes in three stages stalk tassel and then the green okay there's a lot of threes there God always works in threes today we're going to focus on the sanctification we've already started is it God's will for you to be sanctified does he want you to be sanctified yeah what's being purified so you're fully pure when you're fully purified then he can pour in his holy spirit and it gives you power for service right power for service I heard a preacher say this week was a really good statement he said the Holy Ghost gives us power for service they said a lot of people they just struggle with coming to service but the Holy Ghost puts you in power for our service other cutting priest that was really good wow that's wonderful in other words you're the one serving but you empowered for service let's go back here to our mixture on the stature perfect man for the random said this is how you go from justification justification is faith will show that a little bit and you work your way up to love or the Holy Ghost here's another picture which you have the church age is on the side or your next few years I want to go through this kind of slowly well make sure this live I just want to review up again it's more about twenty minutes into the study so we're doing pretty good on top okay so let's turn to second Peter chapter one it's in the back of the New Testament and at the end of it any questions yet so far anybody have any questions them huh any questions we sure appreciate your questions 2nd Peter chapter 1 let's read that 2nd Peter chapter 1 did you know brother Branham said when that love comes down so that they can try and go the capstone he said that makes you a spiritual powerhouse so you have a power against Satan when you're born again of the love of God in other words you have power to fight the really beat them down because you got on the full armor of God now back to the Holy Ghost gives you access to the full armor of God we'll talk about that at the end as well okay let's have some readers here I think it's good for the live stream as well Lydia can you read verse five and they wept case you read verse six here one [Music] [Music] thank you thanks readers appreciate that verse 8 for if these things be in you and abound we got to make them increase more faith more virtue more knowledge more temperance they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things is blind you want to be blind you're going to have spiritual sight children you want us but you don't to be blindly walking around this world I wonder what we should do for God I wonder is there a god you know you want to have your spiritual sight so he lack these things were blind cannot see afar off and I've forgotten that he was purged from his old sin wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling a little sure or if you do these things you should I'll never fail how do you want to be every one of your visitors and overcomers and never fail God's plan for life amen my hands up to if you could do these things fail the Bible says that means I'll always win through the power of God nature I love to win don't you love to win you like to win games does it feel good to win when you're with Christ and you let this holy spirit go through you you win you you cast down and engage the counsels of okay so here's this picture we look up there I used the Greek definitions to kind of show this so we get faith faith is the substance needed to choose the right way because that's choosing to be baptized faith is choosing to follow Jesus Christ we haven't been baptized here okay well if you've come to God correctly then you've got faith you've got a choice you made the choice to follow the Lord with all your heart right you made that choice you've got that you've got faith to choose the right way alright next is virtue virtue means strength the Prophet said the Bible says that - and that's the strength that daily walk the way it also means in public because a Ruth had virtue the Bible said she was a virtuous woman she pleased got in front of the harvesters in front of Boaz all the city knew Ruth was a virtuous woman okay so you go from oh I want to be baptized want to be a Christian now you go I want a little half strength so I can live it in front of my friends I want to live it when we go to the zoo Oh people to know I'm a Christian at the zoo I want to have virtue when I play with my buddies they play basketball or do Taekwondo I have to have a virtue the strength to be a Christian even in the public at Taekwondo right virtue Allah Graham said when you have the virtue people come and they like to be around you because that's straight Wow strong person knowledge is the understanding you need to know why you walk this way why do we winter long skirts as sisters why do brothers always cut my hair why I need to understand why don't we do other things why do we not go to movie theaters all the times see buddy know why we don't we can tell why don't are we not gonna movie theatres yeah they show evil things and the eyes are the gateway to the soul so if you see evil many times you want evil you start lusting after evil right with the lust of the eyes about self-control temperance is the self-control you need to remain on the way it also means fleshly cravings right when your body craves something as your body ever crave too many sweets yeah so self-control is being able to say no I'm not going to give my body what it once it really wants this for me it was smoking that was something and dr. pepper I drink way too much dr. pepper where it may be unhealthy or made me sick or chewing tobacco it makes you really dependent upon something so when you get temperance and how you're strong enough to control your body you just don't do what you'd be like doing all your your cravings under control alright next and who can read that p-word what's that p-word okay haitians so this is steadfastness to be content on the way because patience is steadfast waiting for God to do his work it's your patient I can wait we all say on our hands like this and say I can wait ready Heidi when I don't have to have it right now give me what I want right now no it's the opposite I can wait I have steadfast babies I can wait huh all right the next one is that G word Lydia godliness nextstep you have patience then God wants you to have godliness which is reverence needed to be just like God and Jesus kind of told us how we do that we must love our enemies okay has somebody ever been in TV before have you been able to love them even though they're mean to you okay well it means God's working you working on you with godliness to be like him because jesus said even the sinners can be nice to think about are nice to them right but we need such godliness where we can love even our enemies and the last thing we need before God puts us into his family is the kindness and that makes sure that we're going to treat God's family the right way and that selflessness needs to live for others especially the family of God on this way you can live for Jose and lift versus their NLP you can live for me you're living to treat God's family the right away there's one to be kind to them okay and that love is the presence of God needed to completely manifest the living Christ Christ living in you every day of your life okay let's read some scriptures here let's go to mark 933 got your Bibles 933 I'm going to show you some examples this is the next time I'm gonna leave this up here so you can see it mark 1933 you know one time before the disciples received the Holy Ghost they were arguing about who was who was cooler who was better who was smarter who was stronger led to better preaching they were arguing better than you are and they'd say no I'm better that you are you ever had an argument alone with anybody it's gonna be my way no you're gonna play the game I want to play you ever argued mark 933 the disciples were called dead and they're arguing I'm better no I'm better no I'm better and so they clearly didn't have which one these were they lacking if they're arguing I hadn't greater than you and you need to follow me what were they lacking that's one thing they were lacking for sure brother kind is that's what I thought yeah maybe ten prince2 they could have control their desires so I want to be better than I don't have a better preaching ministry than this person I'm better I'm stronger people should like me more yeah so Lydia can you read let's go to mark 933 let me turn here just just want to show a few examples for this this proves they weren't born again Lydia can agree on 33 and 34 [Music] by John said I'm greater than you like for us it might be well I want to be daddy's favorite do I want to be mommy's favorite I want daddy loved me more than my brother systems you want to be greater than somebody else should we feel like that should we want to be greater than other people we should want to serve other people right because jesus said the greatest is that as the person who does what serve the greatest among you will be the servant all right let's do another let's go to Luke 22 verse 31 22:31 sanctification cleaning these disciples out even arguing who's the greatest Milka volunteer my older children a lot to read so thank you children Luke 22:31 now can you read 31 and 32 there there's a few things actually don't this is the recorded yes some people might watch that from start I think the few things to note there Peter wasn't yet converted yet he spent three years preaching and children he even walked on water and he's doing that the Holy Ghost can you believe that his soul wasn't yet filled with the Holy Ghost because it couldn't come yet because Jesus wasn't glorified yet and it wasn't the day of Pentecost that shows you people can do a lot of amazing things with God's up and still not be born again so it's really important that we be brought down tonight we wanted before together so Jesus says you're not even converted and he said I prayed for you if you make your hands pray so I'm ready for you that your faith doesn't fail so see he was Jesus praying that you'll keep your foundation of faith because guess what in a few hours he's an alert he's gonna lose his virtue he's gonna lose his strength that he's gonna run away from a little girl who says you're one of those gathered aren't you and he swears and said I don't even know the man right he doesn't have enough virtue just Jesus crazy and said please don't let Peter lose his faith is that you read the next two verses 33 and 34 jesus said I'm gonna pray that you don't lose your faith Jesus Peter no Jesus Peter stood up like this imagine yet his arms on the shoulders are ready to die for you I'm ready to go burned in the cross I'm ready to do it he was claiming to have what a lot of strength wasn't I'm ready to do this and just in a few hours the Bible said he ran away from Jesus because he was scared he was scared so we really need the virtue of God don't we in our lives because sometimes we could even think we're higher we can think we're higher in God that we actually are we can make statements that really aren't true but we want to say true statements we want to know where we stand with God at all times Peter didn't know where he stood with God did he he thought I'm gonna stand up but I'll die for you Jesus who when it come to the time a little make your own acacia stand up what you point your finger at me say you're one of those gallons you know Jesus oh and just a few hours later soon no I'm not I promise I swear I don't even know the man and just a few hours earlier he said I'm gonna die with you Jesus I'm ready to go die for you let's give her to class grade hey Johnny T good job that's what it looked like one minute he's like I'm gonna die I don't even know who he is don't kill me don't arrest me I want to go to jail so is it but thankfully right thankfully your brave cookies great for Peter Haven Jesus how many how many are glad Jesus praying for you jesus prayed for you in John 17 he says I pray for them that will hear about me through my disciples and you are some of those that are hearing about Jesus down through all the disciples the last 2,000 years now you get to hear about it Jesus prayed for you yes let me pray for me too he prays for your parents that will have the virtue we should have the strength genetic to be a real witness for Christ let me this is another example I use it like it's easy example I've seen with some sisters sometimes they get baptized and they start wearing skirts but when they go to work they don't have enough strength to wear the skirts at work because people at work making fun of them and so they cross dressed right and they dress like that so that proves if they got baptized it proves they have faith right but they're scared of what people are going to say they don't have the strength to kind of wear the right clothes or a man might not have strength to cut his hair yet I was here what his friends will think about he's scared to cut it very scared to stop smoking cigarettes my friends might make fun of me and that also shows are lacking knowledge because they don't understand like her sister who would wear pants to work she doesn't understand that that's is actually something that God hates right it's an abomination let's say abomination right combination so this person it might be freshly baptized they have faith that Jesus is the way but then they don't have the virtue to wear the right clothes publicly right if I still wear makeup or cut there so they don't to overcome that temptation well I want to be pretty where I want to be like the world or I don't want to be made fun of they don't even have the virtue to stand up but guess what I can add it to the aren't you glad God can and God could have more strength and then God you give the understanding okay I don't want to dominate over men so I'm not gonna paint my face and I'm not gonna wear men's clothes I'm not gonna try to get into a man's position I'm not gonna try to preach like a man does that help does that help everybody understand okay good I want to make sure I show that was one example I wrote down on my on my list here alright look at temperance up there temperance self-control did you know brother Branham would had such a hot temper before he was Holy Ghost filled did you know his teacher would tell him to grab ahold of things and I think it was a string and wrap he said she said wrap that string around your finger until you're you're not mad anymore and brother Graham said he would wrap the string and then it would rip but he'd still be angry it didn't work for him and he said one way I know I'm born again is that I lost my ID my temper anyone God gave you the building control my temper so temperance his self-control right he was able to control himself you guys show me what a temper face look like you show me a Tesla station hey that's a good one so brother Graham was like that but where was his Christian one time you took a shotgun right who's gonna hurt me because they beat him up walking home from school that's how bad his temper was right but he said one way I knew I was born again it was because I didn't do you ever get mad sometimes at your sisters or your brother recently and you feel like it's a really bad temper geography like that you shouldn't be that upset but you are you ever feel like that well that's one example I wanted to give you said that's what I do I was born again because God gave me strength to overcome all right now let's go to Matthew chapter 6 I read this this morning in my Bible reading and I just want to read it again and I want to say this mean to ask for God to ask ask for God to add because Peter said add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge ask and add you have to raise your hand but think about could you would you be happy of God and had it a little more self-control to your life so you did get upset would you like God to add that's a great thing or how about a little more little more patience with instead of getting hot and getting that right away we can be a little more patient if you don't get our way right away God said there's me asked anything they'll give it to us I want to say that we need to ask for God to add to our lives God add more faith to my life ahead more virtue to my life let's look at Matthew chapter 6 I believe this chapter game buddy find that scripture the number seven sin okay thank you I'm sorry wrong chapter thank you brother seven seven thank you sir yes wonderful let's read X actually seven seven and eight okay instead ask and it shall be given unto you cleany seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you okay so let's look up here Breanna and pretend you're gonna ask somebody a question in your unit okay good now pretend you're seeking something if you're in the woods and your seat and you're trying to find push pushes aside okay and then knock on something that's what God wants you to do he wants you to ask you want you to seek and he wants you to knock and say hey I have please have some more they may please have some more virtue may I please have some more patience I'm really not that patient sometimes I get mad at my enemies cannot may you would you please give me some more godliness okay you know Jesus said that that's seeking that you can have all those for good birthday for every one that asketh receiveth he said everyone say everyone ready and let me wait for somebody next you say everyone ready everyone everyone that asks receive every one hey but you will see right everyone we just have to ask and say God add this to my life give me more please I have something but I'd like more faith this is sanctification right it's just purifying your life more and more to be like Christ look at verse 9 or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give my stones now I stand up then my me and say okay today a giant eagle did pretend you're gonna ask me for food so it's asking for something to China to know what the parking lot needs some of those stones out there is that what I said today no he asked me first sound and what did he's getting well today yeah she got a sub right he asked me for a sub so say daddy yeah you and Lydia can split us up is that okay all right give him two glasses great time that's what Jesus is saying if he asked for a set of stuff I'm not going to give him sold out in the driveway all right in the parking lot I'm not gonna say you know what go dig in the trash and find some old banana peels and Jesus said that's what my father's like my father did bless my father he's gonna give me something because he loves you look at the next verse or if you ask a fish will he give him a serpent of course enough if you then being evil God gives unto your children how much more shall come the kind of cycle of the people at church how much more really good I'll tell you more you'll give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost then it'll give him a fruit of the Spirit and that'll give them the armor of God that's how much more I'll give you you gotta ask so think about that don't raise your hand but great many prayers I want you to pray I know your parents do - I want I know they want you to start praying for these specific issues of God she could be more safe goodbye children so the branch said you have to remember said you have to add all these and then God will cap you off with love those and you'll see all those virtues in Geo cap you off and see all those wonderful things in you so there's the examples we went all over almost we're about ready to finish up I've been going about 40 minutes we're almost done so take it take a deep breath in ready resets our mind so we can focus again re okay so here's a big picture I just made this one so I know there's a lot in this one but I'm gonna point to it so you can see okay everybody look up here we've already been showing this so here's what we've been talking about when you have faith that's what you did justified you got baptized where you going to get it deep in baptized all right well you're right here you have faith to be saved because maybe that gift of faith just got baptized and now what does God want to give you hurt you then he wants to give you how there's anyone to give you anyone to give you patience anyone to give you anyone to give you and then he wants to give you the Baptist Holy Ghost which is God's own so we're talking about this today being sanctified be purified this is how God will purify you sodium you all right but you know the children can make these blue words let it bloom works after you're born again but a band said you get the full armor of God so that he can you read that hey cut your belt where you might have a bailout of some of these okay okay how about okay read the next thing on your helmet next one Lydia hey cover your heart the breastplate cover your heart this is a born-again video keep charging the corporation's pretend you're putting on your shoes that's what he does next thanks for everybody put up a shield to block the fiery darts of the devil officer and last one Lydia all right everybody got a sword got your sword this is after you get sanctified so this is where God wants to take you and then he wants to make you a soldier right of the cross and list a server where brother Graham said those groups come after you're born to get the real fruits have got to come after you're born again you have to have the right seat to produce the right kind of fruit doesn't know like those you're born kind of an incorruptible seed of God all right now I've got to read the read these for us right all right Lydia now come to class ready thanks you're really boys and girls I appreciate that and so I just want to show you here's my title after all this after sanctified here God wants to take you up higher and he's going to give you the fruits of the spirit and the armor of God and then you're gonna place you in your position you might be placed as a your mom mr. or did he like your mom my wife might be placed in a position where God gives you authority guess what that kid and the mothers are falling over their children that's a lot of authority I think about jakka Ben think about Moses mob document what did she do that most mothers wouldn't do she built what for baby Moses didn't you remember what she build for baby Moses Esther's you member you heard to Gladys grace now and then Esther what did she do with that basket there's no way she could have done this unless she was full of faith why did she do in that nasty yeah a wonderful let's say oxen job Esther a awesome job after them would would any mom would would most moms do that absolutely think no my wife didn't do that and my own mother didn't do that I'm glad they didn't because it had to be directed by the Holy Spirit right so that shows she was a mature believer she was adopted into her position she could believe the Word of God and then raise your children and she could push out that Ark and not be a play those big fat crocodiles make her arms were like a crocodile she wasn't a scared she wasn't scared crack in the house because she had faith she was a real mature believer and she could push out there know if God if God is with me of God showed me these things God will take care of Moses ducati Moses yeah he took repeatedly led Moses all the way the Pharaoh's daughter and then we know what happened after that Mary went and found Moses is mine Moses might have to spend more time with Moses that's true let's go through a few more things as we close so even even mom's want to find their a position in Christ what what can they do what's their position in Christ and even dads don't dads want to find their position in Christ as a father and a soul-winner and raising their children as a leader of the home they want to be in their positions they don't want to be out of position they want to be in their position and so that's why right so we can get in our position who knows what happened with Judas Judas is position was to be an apostle or a missionary what happened to him in his position he's never take his position as a real missionary with the Holy Ghost no he didn't why didn't he give to his position what did he what he loved more than Jesus money havens who about trade memory he never reached his position he never went his way the statue of her man he never got sanctified all the way he never got bored again he did go to Pentecost to get born again so he never reached his full position in God and the Bible said he was lost and that's so sad how many want to reach their position god I want to be in my position that's what I'm trying to help you do find your positions through the Word of God all right let's close with these last few scriptures well let me stop right there is there any questions about this so far I would think so firstly thinks yeah cuz you think about Stephen he was still the Holy Ghost however they were stoning him he said Father forgive them they don't know they don't know what they do so it's forgiving everybody and Jesus said if you can't forget that's the right question yeah we have to forgive every man their trespasses everyone wonderful question yeah we if we leave somebody Unforgiven and the Bible Center father won't give us any other questions he said somebody hates you are supposed to hate them back or hate them forward well we don't want to hate them back right and you want to forgive them and that's where godliness like now kind of goes with Malachi's question godliness is loving like God does God sends his rein on sinners doesn't he he gives sinners good suppers doesn't but yet do they love God back no so godliness is being able to love anyone who doesn't love you back so yes you have to he you have to not hate them forgive them and move forward with God up into the the other virtues of God that makes sense you can't hate them back we can't hate we can't any friends or people who mistreat our friends and we can't hate anybody and all even that's mean to us I know it's hard right it's hard but who can we ask for help - help us forgive people that hate us who we think we could ask Jesus he said ask sirisha hit ask seek see pretend you're seeking for truth and then knock so I'll just do say knock and say Lord I'm here at your door you say Lord I'm here and the Lord would say what do you want a haven how can I help you you're my daughter what can I hear me we say can you help me forgive someone that hates you think the father will give that to her or do you think he'll give you a circuit or stove what do you say Ava - GLaDOS great job yeah that's right he's gonna give it to you so that's good questions any other questions those are really great questions about being sanctified yes that's a good question the question is you can have some of these virtues for a long time but then there might be a season where you kind of fall short and so I always take that back to brother Branham when he lied to the IRS program said my head felt like it was spinning he lost self-control you know he was born again so we know order to get people to have a measure of these but then God will give us trials which is like pruney you know so when you prune a tree you want to grow back stronger we know about that your lands people you know about that's it but there's a certain season for it right so that's the way we look at it and Jesus said I'm gonna groom you or let you go through a trial allow you to be cut so that you could produce more fruit that's what I would believe if somebody could be born again and you can fall short in one of these areas but it just is just not allowing you to be proved so you can produce more fruit up here so you can have even more temperance so then the next time this person comes you're even stronger to be able to stand up if they're badgering you I program said Jesus had to withstand all the badgering of the Pharisees you mentioned three didn't have years of theirs badgering with questions they set traps for him all the time you ever set traps for anybody here when you play games Jesus would they was constantly a trap here there's a trap here yeah they constantly watch his step so he wasn't trapped by the Pharisee so I hope there's that help brother a little bit by God's grace if that's okay because God always wants to add more to us and those are my last few scriptures time finish up let's go to Romans 12:3 now I do have a quote to go along with this scripture I don't have a quote in front of me but for the brand send a gift of faith like if you have one of the nine gifts of the Spirit and one of them was bait he says that's just more of the right of regular faith she said that's just a greater portion of that faith foundation that everybody has just a greater measure so you just have more faith and that's what your 9 gives the Holy Spirit so Romans 12:3 now could you read this for me buddy thank you guys are such good readers so helpful thank you everybody has a measure or portion of faith right everybody has that so but we can add more to that because I got some more scriptures let's go to Luke 17:5 Luke 17:5 and education have you read this one Luke 17:5 thanks for reading occasion appreciate it Esther how do you feel about reading would you like to try reading Navy okay Luke 17:5 I know you like to read I know mom and dad told me how much you like to he will let us to read this one if she's right because it's a kind of a shorter bursts it's her first time on the mic in love her this 17:5 there's a couple of big words in there like apostles and increase when I'm trying to read that maybe the whole denied for great you were to class great job Esther a great greeting so see the Apostles already had faith but they said give me more do the knocking again Lord can I have more faith increase my faith I need more did they keep it a secret from Jesus or did they ask Jesus let's not keep our desires secret from God no God knows our desires but he loves the ears pray I love when my children come up to me and ask for good things not for candy bars but I love when they ask me for good things I love when they tell me Oh daddy I'd love to get this for Christmas or my birthday because I want to give it to them I want to make them happy I wanted to give them something they love and how much more does God love to give us what we need alright couple more so everybody has a measure a portion but we can add to it to increase our faith so increase our hope sorry increase I've heard you to knowledge temperance he can increase these things okay that's what a second Corinthians 3:18 and they'll have one more for that second corinthians 3:18 we'll have occasion to read this one and i can help you find it if you want on occasion second corinthians 3:18 2nd corinthians 3:18 verse 23 18 chapter 3 verse 18 i will let occasionally this one second Corinthians three eight three universe [Music] [Music] let's get a Shinto classification wonderful do you know who this was talking about Moses remember when he went up on the mountain and the Bible studies he stood with God for forty days and what was his face like when he came down the mountain who remembers now God his face was shining you make your face shine he just stayed with God so much children he was just praying there in God's presence that he started to shine he went from shine here to shine here to shine here to shine here so when he come down here to put a veil over his faces who is so shiny and that's what the Bible says we should do when we read the Word of God or hear the word of God you never look at the Word of God as you look at it this word should shine upon you more and more and more now look up at me and put a big smile you should be shining with the joy of God from glory to glory right we don't have to have a vision or we don't to go up on a mountain we can just hear the word of God pray and see God and then we get more and more of God's glory in our life more and more virtues in our life okay that makes sense the more time you spend staring right here and the word of God the more time or the more you'll be like Jesus right more glory okay last one let's go to Romans 1:17 and right there just out of hours of praises Oh Romans 1:17 hope this has been a good Bible study for the children like I said we're going to pray after this I'm gonna have you look at that and a little bit pyramid against and then we're gonna pray say lord please add this virtue of blame to me or please add this this patience to me please add to this rather kindness to Romans 1:17 alright Romans 1:17 maybe we can read together now to their case you either that is getting there we can all read it out loud here let me hold it and then we'll hear your voice okay on three one two three or therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by hey all right great job I'm gonna give you children around the five things we need today how about a dog so I'm gonna give them around for interacting with us now let's close our Bibles because we're going to close with a word of Prayer and now look up here if you can which one of these characteristics do you want God to add to our life yours is probably going to be different from somebody else's right think about which one you have faith to choose to be baptized and follow Christ you have the virtue or the strength to live it in front of your friends and in front your family and out in public or do we say bad words of public or do we do we follow friends when they do evil when we play games with that do we understand what God's word really means why we shouldn't do things enough can we control our bodily cravings can we control our cravings and things that we want can we be patient and not get angry we don't get our way we eat fast and keep waiting is it hard to wait for things or do we get upset are we godly did we love those who don't like us and are we kind to everyone the church even when they're not kind of us kind others in the church or we I want to look more handsome than Malachi right I think I'm gonna wear a more pretty dress than Haven today are we being we have a broadly kinda so we being kind to our brothers and sisters let's think about those okay so think about which one you want God to add to your life you look up there and give me a thumbs up what you've decided which one you want to pray for temperance patience I'm gonna pray and repeat after me but you put the virtue in there you don't just say it out loud but repeat after me let's bow our heads great say dear Heavenly Father you are good we ask for something you will give it to us and even more than that today we ask that you sanctify us so we can be pure and free for sit please add to my life the virtue I'm thinking thank you for this godly character to my life please fill me with your Holy Ghost Jesus Christ praise God any questions before we dismiss any questions that help with our understanding a little bit does that help us understand where God wants to take you you could be in the center of God's will if you stay right here stay right here say God adds to me faith I had hurt you to me and now it's time parades I didn't even more patient with my sisters and my brother I need to be more patient with my mom or dad we can stay right in the center of God's will and we can grow up into being a real soldier for God and having all the fruits of the spirit so people can see it no matter any other questions okay well the shake somebody's hand I turn around maybe shake some ID and say god bless you we're dismissed [Music]
