reach it this morning revelation three verses five and six so my subtopic is when Jesus confesses your name before the Father that's my subtopic revelation chapter three verse five and six that's the thought that went lead me you know Jesus said I will confess your name before my father in his holy angels that's the thought I just want to by God's grace want to bring out this morning as we look to the Lord let's read verse five together and then I'll read verse six one two three he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels I'll just read verse six he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches that's just by our heads a word of Prayer if you just like the Lord to remember you this morning if you'd like to hear what the Spirit saying just maybe signify by raising your hand or just speak into the Lord as we pray Heavenly Father were humbled Lord by your presence we're grateful Lord that you meet with us Lord God who are we Lord that you would come and minister to us Lord but father were grateful Lord that you look you look to our hearts Lord and you look to the sacrifice or we're looking Lord our our eyes are looking at the blood of Jesus Christ this morning Lord because of your sacrifice Lord we can have fellowship today Lord we ask that your spear would minister to us Lord worthy unworthy ones yet you make us worthy by your grace and mercy help us to hear the word of God help us to hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches and Lord as we look at this thought one day Lord you will confess our name before your father and we want to be it Lord in a way of a reward dear God we want to live a life worthy of the gospel Lord so just take this little thought Lord God I've just try to wait upon your Lord and I just pray you administer this thought now to our hearts we love you Jesus and father for your minister now in Jesus Christ's name never said Amen god bless use me and see you there praise God preciate that bow thank you for thinking about the Saints brother I appreciate that thank you so let's look at part 9 here this morning by God's grace okay you can switch over buddy whenever you get a chance I would like to look at this thought here and I went through a few quotes you know this week you know Wednesday night we looked a little more at the book of life and I just want to just rehearse that there's our scripture that we read today I just want to rehearse this quote real quick where the Branham said there's benefits of sitting under the the pastoral ministry and it's the benefit of teaching verse by verse but mam said evangelists can't do that so Bram says you know he talks about he stayed a year in six months on the book of Revelation at the tabernacle he said oh I just love teaching he said it gives the basis and it settles the church so you know if the Lord is leading me to stay on a topic you know for a long time and maybe maybe you're wondering why it's to give everybody a foundation and maybe you've already heard it before but you know if you pull on God you can pull out something that you need amen brother Mannis I never went to church and left disappoint it so you can pull whatever you have made of out of God but it really settles the church and gives them a great foundation and as I've gone through and preached the seven church ages I've seen how it reveals how everybody goes through all these battles you know you lose your first love and and then you know there's temptations and there's there's test there's tribulation you go through as a Christian you know and then you got to stand you got to you got to hold on to everything you know that that's you lose don't you don't lose your reward you know Paul said there Jesus said that and there's so many things that we can see in our lives our last work should be more than our first we should increase our service to God not decrease it but Jesus said your last work should be more than your first that's a great mystery revelation I thought God gave us from the church age book there and then you know brother Brad was teaching the adoption series and he reads Ephesians 1 and 4 and he said this book is not addressed evangelists so an evangelist is not going to come and teach us the book of Ephesians you might hit a few things but he said he said this is a he said I don't touch this on the fields I bring this to the church in other words I bring this to the local assembly so that's why we go verse by verse it's so critical some of my favorite sermons God has had me preach are the ones where we just preach whole books of the Bible like Esther Nehemiah Ezra you know we went through some of those and some of the most memorable ones the Book of Daniel we just got through that this year how God has just led us verse by verse good book of Galatians last year because it gives us a foundation Amen so we're very thankful for that now I want to look at this thought here I'll confess his name before my father and his angels so my inspiration comes from the next quote its action the church age book from the Sardis church age it speaks of to roll calls in heaven the first is after the rapture and the second is at the white throne judgment there's really two roll calls or to name callings in Scripture if you're if you're if you're familiar with this the Prophet quotes the scripture he said roll call in heaven if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change comes the body change thou shalt call and I will answer thee that would have a desire for the work of thy hands the Prophet said the great Shepherd is calling his sheep by name look at this the creative voice of God is calling them forth from the dust or changing their atoms even though they had not fallen asleep this is speaking of the rapture it is the rapture it is the great marriage supper of the lamb and his bride can you say Amen oh yeah amen I'll say Amen thank you Jesus oh my just to see that there's there's really two callings of the names one of the rapture and the other is at the white throne judgment Loretta said but the rapture is not the only roll call I want to be in that I want to be in the first number Church I'm gonna be like Paul we said on Wednesday night I'll do anything to obtain to that first resurrection I won't let anything get in front of Christ I want Christ first in my life there at the second resurrection at the great right throne we'll names be confessed before the father and his angels now I've been told by those who know the sweetest sound to human ears the sound of that person's name how many could agree to that I would agree how people love to have their names before the public right how they love a claim recognition but no earthly voice will ever sound your name as sweetly as will the voice of God if your name is in the book of life and remains there to be revealed before the holy angels what a day that will be when we hear Jesus say father can I just put my name in there Jesse Smith confess my name before men in the days of his earthly pilgrimage now I will confess his name before you and all the holy angels you can put your name in there too Oh hallelujah I've had my name announced at Ohio State football stadium in front of a hundred thousand people that don't mean nothing to me I want my name announced before God amen and crisis say well done good and faithful servant that's the kind of name that's the kind of name calling and confessing I want to hear praise God that's eternal hallelujah now put a little blank slide here cuz I'm switching over to some different colors so sorry about your eyes it's here oh no I'm sorry okay yeah this is my reminder to switch back I put the other quotes in here so sorry pardon me now I want to just before we get in this last week brother Brooks said he preached some rough words to us I just want to remind us a few these things and I just want to remind us to give our be as sincere as we can before the Lord I just want to just remind us let's be as sincere as we can for church where the Brooks sat at 51 minutes and you can listen to I went back and listened to the message well the Brooks said God don't like starchiness he said God don't like stiff and starchy church folk you're going to have to pull better than you were doing and he said do I sound rough to you he said I hope I do in church I don't know if I ever been that rough I don't know if I've ever been that rough to the home church but I hope if I have forgive me unless it was God you know I only want to bring correction if it's God's Spirit but brother Brooks said I hope I do sound rough to you I hope I'm sounding rough he said we're supposed to be super on fire we need some fire I get jealous for my lord he's worthy to be praised and then he said I'm coming in here you're supposed to blow me away with your amens and I thought you know that scriptural Jesus said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent I just want to remind the church you know that just we want to be a sincere as we can be it's not always in the amount of the emotion or it's not always how loud we are but it's in our sincerity because brother brand there's two different quotes one one quote brother Branham says heaven is a loud place and we should have it loud here and another message he said things that are great are quiet he says he talks about the planets rotating he said they're going a hundred thousand or a thousand miles per hour rotating and he said you don't even hear one little sound so there's a balance but I don't want to ever discourage anybody if you're the kind who likes it loud I'm the kind of likes to go like this one song service and I like to shout and praise God I like to move you know but you're the one who knows if you're giving God your all and there's no really level noise level that's needed unless you know that that's what you need but just remember you know we should take correction because brother branham can he said I condemned the church with the latest message in other words I corrected I tried to bring correction to the church that had the most recent message so we should expect correction when we come to the house of God where the RAM says it's in questions and answers he said now a great part of my congregation is made up of Pentecostal people and become because Pentecost is the latest message that we have in denomination ranks and to me I certainly agree with them more than any of their denominational Church I hang towards a Pentecostal because it's the lair message and all I wanted to emphasize that all my converts that I bring to Christ I try to direct them to some Pentecostal church but I've condemned them in every way that I know how that they were wrong in the scripture by being a denomination and not willing to walk in the light when lights presented to them we got if I had to take my choice to any church in the world I'd take Pentecostal when it come the denomination I know we're passed we're past the age where we have churches now that are not we're met we have messy churches so our churches now are the latest message churches is every understand that and so I just thought of this scripture you know therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with leaven a mouth sore and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth you you and I need to be able to be mature enough where we know am I giving God my all this service am I trying to get in the spirit or am I just trying to get through the service and and then then you're the judge of that you know then you get exactly what you come for praise God then you can be happy leaving here I got exactly what I came for because I put everything into it that I possibly could so we just want to be sincere I don't want to be sincere before the Lord so it's up to us you know it's up to you it's up to it's myself we've got to get in the spirit we got to get out of the flesh now here's my thought you know I took that thought we're brother Branham said that about not only there's no two roll calls there's roll call for the rapture and there's roll call for the white throne judgment and then I just you know I just want to but make a screen here of a potential order and I just kind of want to look at the order the first event is the rapture and then after that there's the presentation of each bride aged to Christ now this is what I believe I'm just gonna preach it the way I can see it in the Word of God so after the rapture when we go to the marriage supper of the lamb as soon as we get there I believe we'll have the presentation of each bride to Christ because brother Branham said the marriage supper is actually the wedding between Christ and the church how many knew that we're engaged right now we're engaged and we have an invisible union and yes we're engaged in our souls or we're married in our souls but it's still the invisible union where the Bram said we're not married yet until we physically be with the body of Christ amen but that's the real physical marriage we'd say when our bodies are changed in his glorious but like his in the glorious body and then there'll be some rewards I believe and I put a question mark here cuz I'm not sure when the rewards actually are but then we have the marriage supper across the table and there's Armageddon and when we return you know Armageddon with Jesus and I said maybe the rewards are either before during the Millennium I'm not sure but I just feel like they're right there at the before the marriage supper then the millennium reign where we rule over nations and then the white throne judgment and that's where I'm going to by God's grace so that's kind of my thought taking here I want to look at some of these quotations before so can't ready see what we want to look at we won't look at when Christ will confess your name he's either couldn't gonna confess your name at the rapture or he's gonna confess your name at the white throne judgment and how many want to be the rapture well then brother man tells us this is how we make ready for the marriage supper brother BAM the part of the batteries the Prophet said the church now is engaged to Christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet so see we haven't had the wedding yet because when I got married my wife went home with me and we're not with Jesus yet are we we're not physically with the body of Jesus his spirit is with us were born again the soul so brother Branham says were engaged he said the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the Lamb and there's numerous quotes on this there's like six quotes on this I just put this one on here just to save some time so we see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife what does he do while they're engaged he's just bestowing all kinds of things send your presents making her feel good are you feeling good this morning Christ is supposed to make us feel good as the rapture approaches he said well that's what Christ is doing this church he's sending us gifts of the Spirit how can you be engaged when then when you're denying those gifts exist it's the very love tokens it's God's token to the church jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe aren't you glad when the gifts operate praise God oh we don't have an operation like maybe 1st Corinthians 14 but we're grateful when the gifts do operate and I'm believing - like brother Brooks said I'm believing I'm confessing that over the church I hope you're confessing it over your life - that there's going to be more of the Holy Ghost there's going to be a great outpouring for you and I praise God we have to believe that it's actually prophetic there is a ladder rain to come amen so I'm going to say thank you Jesus for sending your gifts amen now I'm jumping to another quote brother Rams closing the service on the token the first time he preached it he said now just surrender your life to him he's singing I love him because he first loved me love love love him see what he done for you I love him it's by love love brings obedience love brings courtship love brings marriage and that's where we're headed the marriage supper of the Lamb I hear my Savior calling and he loves me - just all your heart just feel something real sweetly coming into you he said that's the Holy Spirit love we've got to love gathering together we got a love singing we've got a love hearing the preaching of the word we got love saying Amen we got love saying thank you Jesus amen it's love love is gonna bring the courtship and love is gonna bring the marriage in the sky it's gonna be love so the Prophet now moving now to the marriage supper the Prophet the rapture is followed by the marriage supper of the Lamb in the last three and a half years I remember we have to speed up to go to the next dimension so things will go really fast in that other dimension a lot can take place in three-and-a-half human years that can we're talking about a lot can take place in the sixth and seventh dimension right - what can happen down here for three and a half years the private talks and he and he types it - Joseph how Joseph put away his bride before he revealed himself to his brother and I'm not gonna read all that you know that for 3 and 1/2 years while the retributive wrath of God has poured out she will be in the great marriage supper the lamb that's where she'll be she'll be in the marriage supper the lamb hallelujah I like that now then we when he returned leaving his bride his father's house while he makes himself known to his brethren at this very time the antichrist covenant that the jews of may with rome will be broken Rome and her allies then send their troops to destroy all of the god-fearing word abiding Jews now I just wanted I just thought I'd read this with the great power the church systems will persecute the true bride that's where our persecution is going to come from the American churches and politics can brace amen that's what's going to happen before the rapture as far as we know they're gonna try to bring that they're gonna get close to that squeeze to bring it down because they have to be able to put force after the bride leaves they got to be able to force it where you'll die if you don't take the mark of the beast so we got to get close up there and experience little bit of a squeeze this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and true to the people who need it but before the Antichrist and person takes over the complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the Lamb now here's why I believe the presentation of each bride from each age by the messenger is the first thing that happens once we get to the seventh dimension here's what I believe it because the Prophet teaches this and uses second Corinthians 11:2 so this is the scripture right here here's the quote now each of the messages is directed to the angel human messenger - a very great responsibility as well as a wonderful privileges as lot to these men God makes special promises in the case of the 12 apostles sitting on the twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel then remember Paul was given a special promise that of presenting the people of the bro side of his day to Jesus amen Paul said that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ Paul's going to present the Corinthian church the Galatian Church all the churches he established he's going to present them and say Jesus here's your bride amen here's what we labored for here's all the prayers and the fasting and the preaching here's what it produced a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish hey man how'd it happen by the Holy Ghost amen so it will be with every messenger who has been faithful to the Word of the hour in his age it will be some last day it'll be the same special reward that was given to Paul I think most remember how I said I'd always been afraid to die lest I should meet the Lord and should not be pleased or he should not be pleased with me as I failed him so many times well I've been thinking that one morning as I lay in bed suddenly I was caught up in a most peculiar vision we might believe it might have been a translation I say it was peculiar for I've had thousands of visions and not once did I seem to leave my body but there I was caught up and I looked back to see my wife and I saw my body laying there beside her then I find myself in the most beautiful place I've ever seen it was a paradise I saw throngs of the most beautiful and happiest people I've ever seen they all look so young about 18 to 21 there was not a gray hair or wrinkle or any deformity amongst them the young women all had hair down to their waist and the young men were so handsome and strong oh they welcomed how they welcomed me they hugged me and called me their darling brother and kept telling me how glad they were to see me as I wondered who all these folks were one Masami said they are your people and I was so astonished ask are all these branham's and he said no they're your converts amen he then pointed to one lady and say see that young lady that you're admiring a moment ago she was 90 years old when you want her to the Lord I said Oh mind the thing that this was I was afraid of the man's that were resting here while waiting for the coming of Lord I replied I want to see him he said you can't see him just yet but he is coming soon and when he does he will come to who first you first and you will be judged according to the gospel you have preached now we know this can't be the white throne judgment because he's filled with the Holy Ghost and we will be your subjects and I said do you mean I'm responsible for all these he said everyone you were born a leader and I asked him will everyone be responsible and he what about st. Paul answered he'll be responsible for his day Jesus actually said generation you'll answer for your generation remember that we're gonna get to that at the end our generation someone's gonna answer I'm gonna answer for this area if God keeps me here there's gonna be somebody answer for Lorraine right Lima there's going to be somebody answer for every generation that's what Jesus said every generation he said well I preached the same gospel that Paul preached and the multitude cried were resting on that he said yes I can see that God is going to have a special reward to his messengers who have faithfully discharged the responsibility he has placed upon them if they have received the revelation of the word for that age and faithfully preached in their day and live what they preach they'll receive a great reward that's all my desire I just want to live what I'm preaching amen hallelujah I just want to be faithful to the word I'm preaching hallelujah now no I'm gonna make a now we're gonna bring in a dream brother Branham had in the NE Sheridan in the the sixth seal in the dream I'm about to read brother Neville enter before brother Branham he entered into the marriage supper but in brother bear's vision the voice said the message into each age would be judged first I'm just saying I can't explain that I don't know how brother never would enter before the messenger to each age I'm just sharing a dream that the Prophet had and he called it when the rewards I'm sorry when the crowns were given out under something you know that's what the the vision said the messengers judged first but then brother Branham had a dream so I'm just sharing it with you what I know the sixth seal and I dreamed about a month after that I was standing one day I was watching a great time not the judgment now so not the white throne judgment I don't believe that urge every life through in judgment I mean the bride comes to judgment but I was there when the pounds was being given out so this is the reward but we Paul say we all stand before the judgment seat of Christ this is the judgment for rewards and the great big throne set up there in Jesus and the recording angel and all was standing there remember just a dream but it's very scriptural dream and there was a stare likes like coming down this way of white ivory run down in a circle and so that all this great hosts standing out there could see what was happening I remember this is where Paul said it why do we work and labor here and Laodicea because whether we're present here late Asiya or we die we want to be accepted of him that's why we work that's why we labor that's why we don't give up that's why we increase our service because we want Christ to accept us for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ and everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that that he had done whether it be good or bad so si will either appear before Christ before at the marriage supper or will appear at the white throne judgment I want to be sitting with him right well somewhere behind him at the white throne judgment I want to I want to place on the throne by Christ because I want to be the bride of Jesus Christ I don't want to face him at the white throne judgment I want to be sitting with him and I want to judge his word right correct right now amen hallelujah now I want to just slide a note in here I'm not certain when the crowns are actually given out to non apostles what do you mean really Jesse well the Bible says that 24 elders had their crowns before the seals were even open if you read the Bible how many know what I'm talking about there was 24 elders before the seals were ever broken and brought forth the 24 elders already had their crowns so I'm not sure when the crowns are given out and I'll go a step further I'm not even certain that we have literal crowns if we're not apostles because scripture says were crowned with life we're crowned with glory and scripture says we're clown crown with righteousness now revelation 3:11 is one that seems where we may receive a physical crown but to me it doesn't really as long as I'm there with Jesus that's the only crown I need amen hallelujah I don't care they put a crown on my head or not just let me be accepted by Christ just let me live a million just let me live eternally with Christ amen it don't matter to me but one thing I want I want the crown of life I want the crown of righteousness I want the crown of glory amen that's the crown that were actually promised but all three of those Bible writers said that James Peter and Paul all said we're giving a crown but they gave a spiritual crown but we know the 24 elders actually have a golden crown the Bible said and they throw them down before the throne in Revelation 4 verse 10 so I just I just don't want to preach something less I can know it's at exactly in the scripture does anybody understand you might wear a crown I might I don't know but all I want is Jesus so that I think you understand now but as I was standing way back to one side I was standing there never an idea I had to walk up those circular steps up to the throne and you remember the reason you had this dream because he was wondering who he would be married to in the future you know in the marriage supper of the Lamb and God showed him they're both with him remember they both came and got a hold of his arm hope got this one me too got this remember that so that's the reason he had this dream I was standing there I had seen a recording angel would call certain name and I would recognize that name I looked and way back out there here come the brother walkin or the sister walk up like that the recording angels standing there by the side of Christ just a dream now and was watching and their names was there it was found in the book of life remember brother Branham said this was not the judgment this was not the white throne judgment this is after the rapture so to see there's still books there there's it must be the Lamb's Book of Life right it must be the Lamb's Book of Life they're calling forth all the names that were a part of the rapture for the Lamb's Book of Life he looked out over them and say it was well done my good and faithful servant not enter in I look back where they was going there was a new world and all the joys sew up this circular stairs and white throne and everything after they would enter in they would enter him behind the throne and there be mountains and a brand new world a joyful world all can you see it in your spiritual eyes today Church oh there is another land hallelujah that we're longing for its beauty of land amen that's what we're longing for today hallelujah and he said entering the joys of the Lord has been yours since the foundation of the world and I thought oh they go through there and meet one another and just rejoicing and going over mountains and great big places oh can you imagine it I thought oh isn't that wonderful glory hallelujah just jumping up and down see jumping up and down watching the saints go into the the mountainous area the joyous area oh how many want to be there by God's grace oh I want to see that hallelujah then I hear another name I'd say oh I know him I know him there he goes watch him and enjoys the Lord oh my praise the Lord now this is scriptural because Jesus goes through the person who received the five talents and he says enter into the joy of the Lord this is scriptural so this is going to happen when the rewards are given out or we'd say when all the bride appears before the judgment seat of Christ just think they'd say ormond Nevel and I'd say that's old brother Nevel there he is of course he wasn't old anymore right and here he come out the crowd and I could hear him say Jesus say entering the joys the Lord has been prepared for you before the foundation will enter in and old brother Nevel just change and just start back in there just screaming and hollering boy and I just shout glory to God sitting here by myself having a wonderful time watching my brethren go in oh ha ha and then he said a recording angel said William Branham there's the name there's the time where we want Jesus to confess our name amen that's the time we're hearing your name publicly claimed that will be the most valuable time your name could ever be proclaimed hallelujah but the man said I never thought I'd have to walk that so then I was scared I thought oh mine will I have to do that son walking down there and just everybody Pat me say hi brother branham god bless you for the RAM patting me as I go along through a big crowd of people and all of them reaching over patting me like god bless you brother god bless you brother and I was going I said thank you thank you thank you like come I have a meeting or something you know and I was going to have to walk these great big ivory steps and I started walking up through there as I made the first step and I thought I looked at his face we looked at Jesus face and I thought I want to get a good look at him this way and I stopped I had my hands like this I felt something slipping my arm here it was somebody else's arm I looked around and there stood hope those big black eyes and that dark hair hanging down her back white robe on looking up at me like that and I said hope I felt something hit this arm I looked around there was Mita those dark eyes looking up in that black hair hanging down a white robe on and I said me too and they looked at one another you know and I got the member arms and here he went home I woke up and I got up and down in the chair and cried you know I thought oh god I hope it comes like that now he says why it's gonna be a wonderful thing don't miss it by the grace of God do all you can do and then it'll be up to God to take care of the rest of it glory amen so see there's gonna be a time where we've got to enter it and I believe it'll just be like that I believe God will go by the ages now remember there will be the Old Testament Saints standing there as well such a huge multitude of witnesses and all the angels and they'll call Ephesus and Paul will come up first what message did you preach Paul and Paul said I'll preach the message that Jesus taught me in Arabia amen for three years I only I learned it and I only preach what Jesus revealed to me so Ephesus and then all the emphasis Saints one by one have their names called amen then some Myrna then Pergamos then Thyatira hallelujah then Sardis then Philadelphia then later to see you and God will say William Branham he'll walk up his wives there say what message you you preach he said I preach exactly what Paul preached then hallelujah and then one by one will enter into the joys of the Lord what a meeting that will be hallelujah amen and then I believe it'll be time for communion because the bride because we always have the bride and groom are United before we eat right there United before we eat so they got to the United the messenger has to present the bride to Christ and then once they're United in holy matrimony divine holy eternal matrimony hallelujah then they go in to have the wedding supper praise God and Jesus said drink ye all the cup on his night he was crucified I'm sorry rested for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for the many many for the remission of sins but I say and you I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of this vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom see they remember the door was there they had to walk into the kingdom there's mountains and he said Oh a brand new world Oh hallelujah I want to walk in there amen but I was praying in 1964 in Beaumont Tennessee or Texas rather sorry he's there sitting at tables and a Christian Christian businessmen he said we trust that we'll all be there everybody present at that great wedding supper in the air when the king will come out wipe all tears from our eyes and say it is well done good and faithful servants enter into the joys of the Lord that's bread prepared for you since the foundation of the world so we often stand before the king and we off to enter in but then after we're all in then we've got it's time to have a supper praise God and the Prophet tells us this again he's here in Tampa Florida and he said if I never get to speak to his converts upon the earth or shake their hands and privilege of baptizing them in Christian baptism may God on that day when it's all over and we sit down at the wedding supper may have the privilege to look across the table and say oh my he said oh why it was down in Tampa Florida that night brother Branham that I stood at your altar call I'd say now here he is and brother I would say now here he is here's Jesus he's the same yesterday today and forever here's the one I told you about Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen remember look across the table and see some of your converts there hallelujah hey man and say word you though you were the one at Tampa Florida you are the one at Beaumont Texas that got saved you're the one that stood for my ministry you're the one that stood upon the saith the Lord but BAM said we may never have another meeting a breakfast but there's one thing for sure we're going to meet at a supper someday that's a wedding supper when that great table stretch across the sky's reaching from Sky to Sky hmm we look across the table one to another there's bound to be a little teardrop from our cheeks as we think as we shake hands with each other we're not gonna knock over the food I guess we're just stretch our hands across they won't knock Oh everything will just be perfect and he said I remember that sailor meeting here's brother so-and-so he was the one that come in at that time this one down here remember he's from Salem Oregon remember this guy from Tampa that's when they got the Holy Ghost we were down there together oh and we'll start crying saying we're all here it's the wedding supper time amen in 1962 the Prophet said then the king and his beauty will walk out in the white robes wipe all tears away from our eyes and say don't cry children it's all over and turn to the joys the Lord has been prepared for you since the foundation of the world God let us have many sitting around the table because of this effort let me say it again this effort let's talk about us because of this effort that we're putting forth now we'll do all we can do Lord we're depending on you to help us so all the brother Rams efforts you'd be able to look across the table and say all because of my efforts I left my family I left my children but because I went these people got saved and they're here because of our effort how many wanting to give more effort to Christ I don't want to give misguided effort I want to give effort that I know is thus saith the Lord the perfect will of God that's the kind of effort I want to invest in amen hallelujah I want to know God's will and I want to give the effort that God's required me to give amen glory so I can look across the table with soul Satan you're the one that got saved in Akron you're the one that got the Holy Ghost in Akron hallelujah and because of your efforts where he here well Christ will wipe away our tears and will enter into the joys of the Lord Amen let's give some effort praise God as I said you know just so you know I'm not saying this to exalt us or anything but we we supported ro Simon's whole trip to Thailand he's coming home today and just a weekend they had 11 baptisms already and he said God has blessed every meeting except one people all kinds of people are receiving so I told him I said when you get back come give us a missionary report but I said get some rest first by God's grace you see because Bob Ram said if you can't go and you send somebody he said your church's name is wrapped around those crowns or wrapped around those believers for all eternity if we can't go let's keep sending somebody let's give effort let's do something for the kingdom of God Oh hallelujah because we'll look across the table and say oh it's because of your church it's because of what you guys is because of your effort you did that we're here by the grace of God now next is our return at Armageddon and then the Millennium now I didn't make any quotes on this or anything on the Armageddon notes in Revelation 19 when Jesus comes back the Bible said he's crowned with many crowns now that might be the I don't know how all the millions of believers from the church ages I don't know how he's gonna wear that many crowns I'm not quite sure that's what I don't know if we're all gonna cast our crowns over just the 24 elders I don't know for sure but one thing's for sure he's crowned with many crowns and he comes back with his army and they're all dressed in white amen and we know that's when we return praise God will return at Armageddon with Christ and then the Millenium in the Millenium the bride will rule over nations because remember it's going to be a thousand years where the nations are gonna grow children will be born in the money and they remember all those nations that are outside the city are going to be deceived by Satan and he's going to bring them all together around Jerusalem remember that but somebody's got to rule over them for a thousand years and the Prophet said that's the bride because Jesus Christ said if you overcome in a fire to your church age he said you'll rule over nations now let's look at the character what is the care of somebody who rules over Nations what it would look like in laodicea in 2017 brother Aaron told us I'm sorry to switch over to colors I know that hurts your eyes forgive me had he the overcometh and keepeth my works to the end it is very evident from the remarks of the spear on works that the Lord is trying to get his own to see his opinion of righteous works four times he mentions work see we gotta give effort Church we're not saved by works but we want to do works because we want to see people saved I want to see somebody saved like I'm saved I've always prayed that God send people to my church that just love God like I do let me save somebody I always pray for my children God let my children show more love than I've showed to you give them a double anointing or triple annoying thing if I got a double give them triple we just want to see people love the Lord Jesus a man in sincerity and in truth give effort for the kingdom of God and now he says that he who keeps now looking keeps doing his works faithfully you got to keep doing the works until the end will be given power over nations that's what Jesus said he said you'll give power I'll give you power over nations and we'll know who this is what they're gonna be they're gonna be strong spiritually they're gonna be capable unbending ruler and they can handle or cope so powerfully with any situation that's the kind of person that's going to make the rapture that's the kind of person that's gonna rule over nations we have to be unbending in our convictions can you say amen to that we've got to be strong in the Lord we've got to be able by the Spirit's guidance to handle any situation that's what overcomers do they handle all the situations by the holy spirit now even the most desperate enemy enemy will be broken if need be his demonstration of rule by power will be like unto the very sons just like Jesus Oman and this is very amazing how many appreciate that the man said it's very amazing when we're gonna see people rule over nations because they were strong in the Lord they didn't bend to the pressures of Laodicea they were unbending they didn't bend to the pressure of family or anything at all they didn't they just kept the Word of God and they handled every situation with the power of the Holy Spirit Gloria how many want to be one of those I want to be one of those I want to handle every situation by the power of the Holy Spirit now let's jump now to the white throne judgment like I said I don't plan to preach preach much longer here let me set timer here give me 15 more minutes I'll try to finish by God's grace the white throne judgment now as we looked on Wednesday night the white throne judgment is a separation of people it's the people that are as sheep being separated from the goats but brother ham said the foolish virgin are not truly sheep because they didn't receive the Holy Spirit during their days on earth they weren't truly sheep they they must have been following something else rather than the full baptism of the Holy Ghost now let's look at the saved or the righteous or the foolish virgin we call them all those those are just different names for the same group of people now this was encouraging as you probably remember this Jesus speaks to the foolish virgin and the King says unto them on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world see this proves the foolish virgin was foreknown before the foundation of the world because God knew which names would remain on the book of life amen hallelujah so you must remember that remember jesus said a very similar thing to the bride right who had the five counts well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord prepared for you from the foundation of the world he says a very similar thing see because both their names remain on the book of life the bride is the Lamb's Book of Life the foolish version is the book of life but the Prophet says after that there'll be disappointments and surprises at the judgment Satan's Eden the Prophet says again it's religious sin as at the beginning so deceitful watch it now it's not just purely every old everyday sin committing adultery and getting drunk and using God's name in vain that's not it so we're not going to actually look for that today right that's not really deceptive someone's committing adultery or getting drunk or cussing that's not a surprise that's we know that sin right but Satan is more deceptive than that he said you remember years ago many of you hear the old timers remember that sermon I preached on the disappointment that the judgment the heart at she ain't gonna be disappointed there she knows where she's going the drunkard ain't gonna be disappointed there the bootlegger gambler the liar the thief he's not going to be disappointed because they know they stole from God they lied to God they lied the guy of God's people I brought I brought drunk I gambled I know I should not have gambled I should not have trusted management trusting God but it's the man who thinks he's right there's the disappointment that's what the fellow said come haven't I preached the gospel but not cast out Devils in their name so he goes back to Matthew 7:21 Lord have we not done this and Jesus said you didn't do the will of my father see their efforts were in the right channel the efforts of the believer must be in the right channel right we must have the right effort in the right channel now I just want to note this remember all people still have their human spirits and souls at the white throne judgment they all have their human spirits because some of them have a state of surprise and then others ask Jesus questions see so they still have a human spirit they're able to ask Jesus questions because remember the righteous who are say the foolish version they're like when did I do anything good deal Lord see they're asking questions they're trying to understand they have to have a human spirit to do that remember the souls under the altar the Jews they said Lord how long will it be to revenge our blood and they're asking for something that's not good revenge is not anything for man its revenge is for God so see their reasoning and their their thoughts aren't the right way in the rich man and Lazarus member they're both reasoning down there in hell we'd say in the prison house their reasoning they've already died but they still have their human spirits and souls and they're able to ask Jesus questions and here's where we generations and individuals we judge by their works at the light throne judgment God will call every generation forth and then the generation want to answer and then individuals will have to answer as well and brother Bram said for those who are lost which we know the Scriptures Jesus said this as well for every individual the prophets said the rising up of every warning will come upon the individual so somehow God will replay every warning God sent to that individual you had a chance here you had a chance here Church let's take every chance we had to get right with God every warning will rise up against those who just turned the warning away well I should have did this I did it I should have did he's gonna bring up every time he gave us a warning God have mercy to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit to take heed to warning because it's true the Bible said they'll be judged out of those things written the books corta their works they were judged every man according to their works God will bring up every time a warning came up but yet they chose this work well I'll do this work instead of that work let's choose God's works God's works or eternal the works of man will are frivolous they'll fail the Bible said they're judged by their works they chose to do this work instead of doing what God warned them not to do here's where he says in Elijah 1953 you see a man a young man here this week and look back and look it looked like it hasn't been no time and there he is broke down his hairs returning grace let's see how that or how fast time goes and the beautiful young woman she's withering away that's a warning so she withering away getting older gray hair it's a warning the Prophet said prepare to meet God yes sir and everything that's pointing you to that will witness against you at the day of judgment I forgot to highlight everything let's all say everything ready everything the gray hairs the witness the withering away getting old all these are witnesses we've got to answer some day when I come to the end of the road and you come to the end of the road when we get there God is to make everything here listen the trees how trees die and come back God's gonna use trees to witness against people everything is going to make every warning be rising up in judgment against those who are lost God's gonna use the trees he's gonna use the storms all these mass shootings gonna use everything everything that's a warning God's gonna bring all I tried to warn you here I tried to warn you here I tried to warn you here god help us to listen to the Holy Spirit now look at this he'll call up now let me get back to this quote I'm gonna jump back here let's go to Jesus words here yes the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation the member this is all everybody you have the bride behind the throne you have Jesus on the throne you have the bride back here the Old Testament Saints back here and then out there you have all the people from every generation and Jesus said the men of Nineveh will rise in judgment so see every warning will rise against the person who rejected it and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here hey man and not only will the men of Nineveh rise but God gives every word with two or three witnesses hey glory now Louie does he raise up Nineveh he raises up the Queen of the South which was a thousand years before Christ the queen of the showers South shall rise up in the judge with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here now look at Church the only gift she came for was wisdom glory it wasn't tongues it wasn't miracles it wasn't bait it was just a gift of wisdom and God is going to make all the people jeez they answer because they left everything they had to support one gift of wisdom what about us today hey man we've got the fivefold ministry or we've got to give them healing or get their tongue in the congregation but we've got to invest in that we've got to put effort into if not God's gonna make those answer who don't invest in the gifts amen so can you imagine let's skip all the Old Testament and Jesus will start he'll start with the generation the generation that was on the earth we'd say 100 BC to 100 AD that generation must rise and then Jesus would say open the books to this generation that the Bible wrote about Matthew Mark Luke and John open the books and judge their works and they're gonna shout out and and they'll shout out things that they'll make up excuses well I I couldn't I couldn't leave you know the Sanhedrin because I would have lost my money like people today I couldn't leave my job because the money are couldn't forsake my family and follow the message because of my family and the church said well this was said here look at this I'm sorry he said even the crimes of the wicked will condemn you he says when the cries of the wicked that is in hell when you stand there and say well I didn't I meant to do right Lord he said but there will be millions of them in Hell saying you have to condemn him because I had the same intention and you sent me down here you're not just God if you let them get by with it hey man so that generation will rise Caiaphas will stand there man all these Sanhedrin all these Jewish people stand there and have to answer they'll make excuses well I couldn't give this I couldn't give up that and and I meant to follow the message I meant to do better I meant to try a little harder but those voices arise up many million voices said we had the same intentions it's not about intentions it's what you feel led to do praise God it's the actual fruit that comes out of your life and the church said glory it's the fruits that come out of your life that's what matters the Pharisees had corrupt fruit because they were Crupp seed praise God but the believer had fruit come out of their lives how many thankful were the fruit of the Spirit amen millions so those make excuses Caiaphas will say well I was the there was so much pressure I tried I couldn't I didn't mean to do this and they'll say you can't do that you can't let Kivus go in all these millions of voices you must be just and they'll say they'll say God is a just God and he'll see you say depart from me you that work iniquity I never need you Caiaphas I don't appreciate the word of the Lord they'll rise and if there's nobody in your day well that someone might from our day one Slayer to see it comes up I might say well you know I meant I meant to follow the message closer I meant I meant to do all these things I meant to do a little better but there was nobody you know nobody that I knew was no struggle like I did and God will raise up a witness there'll be a hand raised up on the sea of witnesses a hand raised up and God will rise that witness up and come up to the courtroom right rise up against God can pull back somebody from a thousand years God can go pull back somebody from five hundred years but God has a witness God has a witness in every age amen glory so we cannot make excuses because God will have every warning rise against us well you saw the trees you saw them lose their leaves every year you knew death was coming you knew this your hair's turned gray right you saw somebody else living it you should have filed their example and remember we know this jesus said another one that saith Lord Lord but he that doeth the will my father look what he says in Matthew 25 then he said them depart I'm sorry then he shall say unto them on the left hand depart from me he cursed an everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink our merciful God gives salvation by the simple act of kindness jesus said so by simple act of kindness these that are lost only have enough kindness to give a little bit of clothes to somebody I think about you who've you who've you and I huh plainly with clothes who we help with food now this is the foolish version will get saved for that and the foolish version gets saved for that how much more should we be helping out the poor is there anybody in prison you can go visit eternal life we know is living for others who are we helping our lives are here to help other people who are we helping with our money who we helping with food who are we helping with this we open with that that's what the fouché version does at least we should at least do that now I want you to this this this next slide goes back to that thought about Nineveh God is looking for respect for his gifts that's what God is looking for we must fully support the gifts God has placed in our area that's what it came down with the men of Jesus day they didn't support the ministry that God sent them see God God is going to do this respect to a lesser gift of God we'll witness against those who disrespected a greater gift solomon's ministry was on no level compared to Jesus Christ praise God Jonah's ministry was on no level to Jesus Christ not even close but because they respected Jonah they respected Solomon even though it's a lesser gift God gives them eternal life amen so we must respect the ministry that God sends to us we can't to determine the ministry God sent to us we just have to recognize where's God's ministry that he sent to us and we must back that with all we've got right cuz he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll always judge justly now this is one thing I brought out Wednesday I want to bring it out if he didn't hear it the foolish virgin was unaware that Christ was in the brethren they said when do we do anything good to you Jesus they didn't even know that Christ was living inside of the wise virgin they got so common to them praise the Lord the wise version were so common to the fourth virgin oh they're just you know that's just brother-sister so and so you know I just this proves a few things first it shows how foolish the foolish version truly is because she couldn't recognize a Holy Ghost filled life Jesus when did we see you we didn't even know you were in your people they didn't even know that I thought it was just about attending church I thought it was just about being a good person and Jesus gonna say I lived in them I was living in their lives and because you were good to them I'm giving you eternal life we can do a better job of serving one another here can't we Paul said be good especially to those of the household of faith we must be good to one another second it proves how humble the bride truly is because she never exalted herself she never stood there and said look at me I'm the wise virgins look at me the foolish virgin just was nice and they're giving eternal life see it's always God hiding himself in simplicity in the bride's simple spirit filled life the bride's life just just revolves around the Lord Jesus Christ they're filled with the spirit they're walking the truth but it's so humble people will miss it because it is so humble and remember every congregation will answer at the White Throne someone bring it back to us I like to do that from time to time now remember if you're in the bride though you'll stand there right with Jesus and then when the the foolish version is brought up or whatever to make the rapture and it comes to our age the generation of twenty twenty seventeen whatever generation we're in maybe two generations after the Prophet they'll call I don't know we will come up or those that aren't in the bride will come up to be judged and Paul said obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they must watch for your souls as they must give account that they may do it with joy not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so see they'll give joy if it's at the if their foolish virgin grief if it's if their lost think about all the churches the Prophet said you misbehavior of unconfessed sin of you believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the Day of Judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it and the church said here's another one adoption well Graham said let us just read it and believe it the way it's written and especially we shepherds of the flocks we pastors who someday will gather yonder in that glorious land with the little flocks and will stand the presence of the Lord Jesus SR you're gonna stand with on that day church all of us will stand together this generation would come up and our church will stand there left to answer in our church bitterly fail or did our church succeed by the power of God and we'll see that generation come up upon a Peter and of Luke and a mark and Matthew know them and see them judge there with their groups we don't have to wonder well Who am I gonna be judged by right where we gonna be at we're gonna be right with our flocks right with our generation God grant that I can lay ten million trophies at your feet while I humbly crawl up my and lay my hands upon your precious feet and say Lord they are yours look at the humility there how many love the Lord today I'm happy to I want to I want to stand there with joy like all of you by God's grace but we've got to make the effort we've got to make the effort Branson you got a decision to make your Cadis you see it much you you see it stand much longer why why halt you between two opinions why isn't the church on fire why isn't this place packed out with people wise and great signs and wonders done don't lay it on the pastor he said it's you now I'm gonna say later it can be on the pastor like he's gonna say it later he's gonna say later I'm not saying I'm I'm the one who's not guilty or anything like that I'm just let's just read the quote he says we got a mixed multitude one point one way and one the other we got to come to a time a decision if it's the pastor there it is fire fire me if I'm if I'm keeping the church for meat on fire fire me right get him out of that and put somebody else in there who will take his place if it's a deacon take him off the board and put somebody else in his place that will take the place he said what are you gonna do brother God put the responsibility upon you our church and we've each one got to give an account for our own sins and answer at the day of judgment but see the bride that the bride won't have any condemnation because she's born again and God's Spirit has helped her confess all the sins now on this side amen so there is no surprise at the judgment Amen because everything is under the blood here Church everything says confess any questions any wonderings about how's this how's my relationship with that brother sister any questions are taken care of here and so they can be the Bride of Christ because there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus now let's stand because I got just a couple more quotes I mean I'm going back to this one here let's then so our names are going to be confessed and either the marriage supper of the lamb or the white throne judgment and the Prophet said well the Bible tells us we'll come up with our generation will come up with those that we associated with here in life and did we respect the ministry that God sent to us Solomon's age can it helps you know all's we got is to get the wisdom that's all right just support it maybe that's what you need support it with all that you got if they disrespect that ministry hear that I'm here with the spears edge of the church once more the Spirit has spoken I trust he spoke at the school once again we've reviewed the record of what the spirit said to another age and we have found the record correct another age has gone by and it was fulfilled exactly as he said it was easily what a consolation that is us I'm you're hoping to eat the last day I can say that because I know what hope I'm talking about I thought about just oh I'm talking about hope that comes
