[0:00] lord for that it's a great revelation
[0:01] for us in this hour
[0:03] and i ordered the book uh i should get
[0:05] it tomorrow
[0:06] my first copy of the bookstore
[0:08] uh i probably hugged that book for a
[0:10] little while and i said thank you jesus
[0:12] it's only been two and a half years and
[0:14] then i got proofread it one more time
[0:16] and then then i can start freaking out
[0:18] i'm excited about that by the way
[0:22] now i turned this on earlier so it shut
[0:23] off and i discharged the batteries
[0:30] leviticus 16 29 though
[0:33] sister who is memory verse from jeremiah
[0:35] 29 so
[0:37] 16 29 i'd like to look again here we'll
[0:40] be looking at the day of atonement here
[0:42] today we finished with the
[0:55] 1629
[1:10] i think
[1:25] this is nice to see the same thing
[1:27] happen there
[1:28] you know revelation 10 7 finished the
[1:30] missions of god so the seven seals were
[1:32] loose by the lamb right in heaven
[1:34] brought down the earth brought us the
[1:36] real atonement praise god the full
[1:38] understanding of the atonement by god's
[1:40] grace it ain't just speaking in tongues
[1:41] your tone it's the baptism of the holy
[1:43] ghost in your soul now you have the
[1:45] atonement
[1:46] so there's a great connection there the
[1:48] reality of that was restored through the
[1:50] ministry of brother branham praise god
[1:52] it was given on the day of pentecost but
[1:54] lost a lot of the reality of it uh until
[1:56] all mysteries are finished at the end
[1:58] time leviticus 16 29
[2:02] let's read that together ready one two
[2:05] three and this shall be a statue forever
[2:08] unto you that in the seventh month on
[2:11] the tenth day of the month you shall
[2:14] afflict your souls and do no work at all
[2:18] whether it is we of one
[2:20] your own country or a stranger that's so
[2:23] determinative um
[2:24] praise god we'll come back and read some
[2:26] more that later let's go to the sister
[2:27] who has no reverse it's a little bit
[2:29] longer versus
[2:30] jeremiah 29 11 12 and 13.
[2:39] 11 12 13.
[2:50] don't you turn there we're going to
[2:51] receive saints in the house of god
[2:53] tonight
[2:54] remember we have brother simon coming on
[2:55] sunday he'll be reaching both services
[3:00] i'm just trying to stay right at it
[3:02] seeing the
[3:21] you know three one two three for i know
[3:24] the thoughts that i think toward you
[3:27] saith the lord fought for peace and not
[3:30] of evil to give you an expected end and
[3:34] shall you call upon me and he shall go
[3:38] and pray unto thee and i will hearken
[3:40] unto you and ye shall seek me and find
[3:44] me when you
[3:59] okay so i have an announcement i'm not
[4:00] gonna share it now it's kind of just a
[4:01] fun announcement
[4:03] i'd like to share nonsense live stream
[4:06] i'm trying to make a reminder
[4:18] okay
[4:19] okay so let's look at the word of the
[4:21] lord here for tonight we ended with a
[4:22] feast of trumpets and i'm sorry i went
[4:24] back to listen to it today and for some
[4:26] reason the audio just stopped like
[4:28] midway through the sermon
[4:31] i was still up there preaching watching
[4:33] everybody moving around you know some
[4:35] reason all the audio caught off last
[4:36] week but we recorded it here didn't we
[4:38] if anybody would need it did we record
[4:40] last week
[4:53] i have a
[5:03] i just want to show that picture again
[5:04] uh it gives us the schedule or the
[5:06] rather the
[5:09] prophetic calendar of god's timeline
[5:11] natural to spiritual and you know we're
[5:13] right here right now we're finishing up
[5:15] the last few souls to be saved it's
[5:17] perfect isn't it church you know there
[5:19] was great revivals you know just not
[5:21] even 100 years ago
[5:22] major revivals but here we are where the
[5:24] bible said there's a famine
[5:26] right at the end time jesus said if you
[5:28] there be that find it uh paul said evil
[5:31] seducers will wax worse and worse and
[5:33] the bible says it'll be a gleaning time
[5:35] here we are right at the end
[5:37] and it just matches the state that we're
[5:39] in right now so it's hard to open the
[5:41] wheel i know it's hard hard for you not
[5:43] to see more soul save you know all the
[5:44] effort we put in
[5:45] it's hard not to see more souls say but
[5:47] we got to realize that's the season that
[5:48] we're in
[5:49] and we're never going to quit we're
[5:50] never going to work we're never going to
[5:52] give up we're going to work till jesus
[5:53] comes amen so we just can't quit because
[5:56] we know it prophetically that's where we
[5:58] are and so we just got to keep laboring
[6:00] until jesus comes
[6:02] now uh we looked at the feast of weeks
[6:05] and then we we did the trumpets last
[6:07] week of course trumpets were gathering
[6:08] together they were blown saying come to
[6:10] the day of atonement prepare yourself in
[6:12] nine more days we'll have the day of
[6:14] atonement now we read there in leviticus
[6:17] that this was a day to afflict your
[6:20] souls
[6:21] okay it was a day of affliction it
[6:23] wasn't a day of rejoicing this whole
[6:26] season was rejoicing my we're bringing
[6:27] the wheat we have all this we got all
[6:30] this bread for the winter time we're set
[6:32] thank god for the week right they were
[6:34] all rejoicing for all this time that's
[6:36] why we're rejoicing now thank god uh for
[6:38] all these souls saved we're gonna have a
[6:40] great time at the marriage supper we
[6:42] have a glorious time in the millennium
[6:43] it's rejoicing now praise god but once
[6:46] it switches over it becomes a very
[6:49] serious condition right just like when
[6:51] it switches over to the gentile church
[6:53] age the last they will see the age uh to
[6:56] the tribulation it becomes real serious
[6:58] life and death serious right it becomes
[7:00] a time of torment the sixth seal uh
[7:03] causes the the nature to to start being
[7:06] interrupted right nature gets
[7:07] interrupted by the true prophet
[7:09] that we know their ministry is real
[7:11] serious because bride is god mercy on
[7:14] uh right from gentiles there's only
[7:16] mercy from the jews
[7:18] and so it comes down to this day
[7:20] of atone nine days later now this was a
[7:24] day it was the most holy day of the year
[7:27] now what's your most holy day maybe
[7:29] easter i know a lot of people look to
[7:30] that day
[7:32] some people might look to christmas it
[7:33] don't matter what day it is uh some some
[7:36] sometimes the bible says some people
[7:38] esteem some days others you know some
[7:40] days more holy than others the bible
[7:42] said other men esteem every day alike
[7:44] right so every day is a holy day but
[7:46] here in israel this was the most holy
[7:49] day of autumn called yom kippur
[7:52] okay it was a day to come and the bible
[7:55] said mourning and humiliation that's
[7:58] what the word afflict means to mourn and
[8:01] afflict yourself and humiliate yourself
[8:03] imagine you come to church and you bring
[8:05] your goat you bring whatever your
[8:07] offering is and you're just humiliated
[8:09] you're ashamed that all this year you
[8:12] just you've fallen short of jehovah's
[8:14] glory you've disappointed yahweh right
[8:16] you've disappointed jehovah so much but
[8:18] but that's how you come to the house of
[8:20] god on this day of atonement
[8:22] and the bible said though
[8:24] you come afflicted but you're gonna
[8:27] leave happy praise god
[8:29] you come afflicted but you knew god was
[8:32] gonna send all your sins away because
[8:34] there was two goats offered on this day
[8:37] praise god and this was the one day of
[8:40] the year the high priest could enter
[8:42] into the holiest beyond the veil praise
[8:45] god and he had the bells and the
[8:47] pomegranates all his garments and
[8:49] everybody knew as long as he was moving
[8:51] and they could hear the sound that our
[8:54] intercessor is still alive thank god god
[8:56] has not cast us off but god is going to
[8:59] forgive us and we're going to have grace
[9:01] for another year praise god
[9:03] and but that hype he's had to sprinkle
[9:05] the outer corpse you know with one of
[9:06] the one of the goats and you have to
[9:08] sprinkle all the way in and you have to
[9:10] take the blood into the presence of god
[9:13] hallelujah in other words god always has
[9:15] to see blood thank god that the blood of
[9:17] jesus christ is sprinkled on our lives
[9:20] amen but we say forgive me jesus i'm
[9:22] trusting in you you're sprinkled with
[9:24] the blood of jesus christ amen
[9:26] hallelujah and so he'd sprinkle it as he
[9:29] went in all the way this was the great
[9:31] day of atonement praise god and all the
[9:34] iniquity all the transgressions for the
[9:36] whole year imagine church imagine all
[9:38] the sins you've done this year but
[9:40] imagine what it would be like to go to
[9:42] church one time during the year and say
[9:44] my slate is clean
[9:46] just imagine the weight you would feel
[9:48] just you feel like the weight would just
[9:50] drop off your shoulders and i got a new
[9:52] starter i got a fresh start to to the
[9:55] year but thank god that we don't have to
[9:57] do it like that we can go to church and
[9:59] leave that that way every time there's
[10:01] turns
[10:02] and you can feel that way on thursday
[10:04] even when we don't have church you can
[10:06] feel that way on monday you can feel it
[10:08] any time because the blood of jesus
[10:10] speaks greater things than the blood of
[10:12] the evil or the blood of bulls who knows
[10:14] the blood of jesus christ
[10:24] god
[10:25] through the blood of the goat praise god
[10:29] and this is of course called all the way
[10:30] in leviticus 16 the whole chapters will
[10:32] go to that and then a short snippet and
[10:35] leviticus 23 and then also numbers 29
[10:39] 7 through 11.
[10:41] so this that's just a very short brief
[10:43] summary of the day of atonement but you
[10:45] came there in humiliation you came there
[10:48] uh mourning over your sin all it was a
[10:52] awful year remember a church the bible
[10:54] said they would make a sacrifice and
[10:56] they would leave with the remembrance of
[10:58] their sin
[10:59] they would they would and leave and they
[11:01] would still feel bad
[11:02] uh and
[11:04] but this day was a day where they knew
[11:06] it was all done away with as long as
[11:08] that man came out alive as long as that
[11:10] high priest came out alive they were
[11:12] good for another year aren't you glad
[11:14] that jesus christ came out of heaven
[11:16] amen he came out of heaven he came up
[11:18] from the grave alive amen and then he
[11:21] ascended to the father and came back
[11:23] down our high priest is still alive amen
[11:26] he's not dead he's alive thank god what
[11:29] a blessing that we have to know that we
[11:31] have uh we have uh
[11:33] representation in heaven amen you have a
[11:36] high free speak in his blood and
[11:38] speaking about his blood and speaking
[11:40] about forgiveness uh having mercy upon
[11:42] us interceding for us today amen
[11:45] in the presence of god it's a tremendous
[11:48] blessing
[11:50] now prophetically church this day of
[11:52] atonement is fulfilled after the three
[11:55] and a half year ministry of the two
[11:58] prophets the two witnesses
[12:00] uh because
[12:02] because the they they don't have uh the
[12:05] they don't have the baptism of the holy
[12:06] ghost remember the bible said they they
[12:08] sacrifice animals we looked at those
[12:10] three scriptures in daniel last week and
[12:12] they're sacrificing animals if they had
[12:14] already accepted jesus christ they
[12:16] wouldn't be sacrificing animals
[12:18] so he has to break covenant in the
[12:20] middle of the week and cause the
[12:23] sacrifice to cease
[12:25] so they have they might know about jesus
[12:27] because brad said the two prophets will
[12:29] preach about jesus but they certainly
[12:31] haven't accepted him yet uh they
[12:33] certainly don't have a revelation yet
[12:34] they don't have a revelation the nail
[12:36] prints because pretty soon on this day
[12:38] of atonement when they get them back
[12:40] from the holy ghost they're going to ask
[12:42] where did you get those imprints they're
[12:44] not sure where they come from right so
[12:46] they see the two prophets and they know
[12:48] something's going on it's a tribulation
[12:50] and they're dedicated to god they're
[12:52] offering their sacrifices they have
[12:54] peace with rome right they have a little
[12:55] bit of peace here for three and a half
[12:57] years uh but yet they're seeing some
[12:59] things in nature happen they wouldn't
[13:01] rain in certain places right water
[13:03] turned to blood they're having all of
[13:04] these they're seeing all these things
[13:06] still sacrificing animals and then the
[13:08] two prophets die
[13:10] right uh everybody celebrates except for
[13:13] the jew but then they they're in there
[13:15] in the street and they see them rise up
[13:17] can you imagine those dead bodies rise
[13:18] up they're going to see rise over that
[13:21] and the resident is going to rejoice all
[13:24] the sinners are going to be mad and
[13:26] screaming and going crazy
[13:28] uh to prepare them to see those big huge
[13:30] demons they're going to torment them for
[13:32] months five months those scorpion
[13:33] horse-like demons they're just getting
[13:35] ready for that they're
[13:36] they're gonna lose their minds
[13:38] uh it's just it's god's gonna torment
[13:40] them because of their unbelief and their
[13:43] failure to repent even after seeing the
[13:45] rapture can you imagine seeing a
[13:46] resurrection seeing someone raised from
[13:48] the dead after three to half days but
[13:51] they'll do it and the bible said they'll
[13:53] ascend and the remnant will glorify god
[13:56] and realize
[13:57] whatever these guys were talking about
[13:59] it's right amen and of course they must
[14:02] have been talking about jesus
[14:04] so sometimes shortly after that jesus
[14:07] physically comes to the 144 000
[14:10] and he and they asked him what are the
[14:12] wounds in thy hands now he must look
[14:14] like a regular man
[14:16] because he doesn't look like an angel
[14:17] they're like they're not like oh you're
[14:19] an angel he must look like a regular man
[14:21] so he's like what a five foot two man
[14:23] they wrote
[14:24] you know five foot two two or whatever
[14:26] walking up there and they're just gonna
[14:28] meet jesus somehow i think it's on mount
[14:29] zion
[14:30] uh well they're going to meet him before
[14:32] that because they got to go mourn for a
[14:33] while then come back and be born again
[14:36] but somehow jesus comes there and his
[14:38] glorified body looks just like our
[14:40] bodies right now
[14:42] it's just a regular body and they're
[14:44] going to walk up and see where did you
[14:45] get
[14:47] those scars and he said i got them in
[14:50] the house of my friends
[14:53] not enemies but friends
[14:56] the ones who crucified him he still
[14:58] called them friends let's look all our
[15:00] enemies stand they've hated hallelujah
[15:02] yeah we know they're lower than a
[15:03] snake's valley we know they might have
[15:05] blasting the holy ghost or they might
[15:07] have done some evil things or but let's
[15:08] consider them friends you know if god
[15:11] hasn't told us not to pray for them
[15:13] let's pray for them if they're not out
[15:14] from the under the blood let's pray for
[15:16] them let's be friendly let's let the
[15:18] love of god rub off on them amen let's
[15:20] be a city on the hill that cannot be
[15:23] healed let us shine in the light of
[15:24] jesus christ or they can say there's
[15:27] something different about that brother
[15:28] or sister they have the real light of
[15:30] god amen
[15:33] jesus said i got him in the house of my
[15:34] friends
[15:36] he didn't call him murderers
[15:37] he could have that's what many of them
[15:39] were but he said the house of my friends
[15:42] and instantly guilt and shame take over
[15:44] them because that's what the day of
[15:46] atonement's all about
[15:49] the bible said that weep
[15:51] and mourn from house to house they start
[15:54] realizing they their fatal move of their
[15:57] ancestors of crucifying their own
[16:00] messiah
[16:02] zechariah 12
[16:03] 10 through 14 catches this the bible
[16:07] said i'll pour on the house of david
[16:10] the spirit of grace and supplication and
[16:12] they shall look upon me whom they pierce
[16:15] and they shall mourn for him as one
[16:17] mourneth for his only son and shall
[16:20] be in bitterness for him as one that is
[16:22] in bitterness for his first born
[16:25] and there and that day there should be a
[16:27] great morning in jerusalem as the
[16:29] morning
[16:30] of hadarim in the valley of megadon and
[16:33] the land shall mourn every family apart
[16:36] he mentions that the family the house of
[16:38] david apart and their wives apart
[16:40] and the family of the house of nathan
[16:42] apart and their wives apart so they
[16:43] break up into individual mourning prayer
[16:46] meetings
[16:47] right the women go here the house of
[16:49] david house of manasseh house of esther
[16:52] the women go here the men go over there
[16:54] they separate men and women in order to
[16:56] weep and cry how could we have missed
[16:58] him how can we have missed our messiah
[17:01] how can we have crucified isaiah 53 how
[17:04] could we have crucified isaiah 9 6 how
[17:06] could we have crucified the everlasting
[17:09] father amen oh my the son of
[17:12] righteousness how could we have done it
[17:14] and then we the bible said every family
[17:17] apart and their wives apart
[17:21] their souls are afflicted because it's
[17:23] the day of atonement
[17:26] amen thank god and then god opens a
[17:29] fountain of forgiveness
[17:31] zechariah 31 says in that day there
[17:34] shall be a fountain open to the house of
[17:37] david to the habits of jerusalem for sin
[17:40] and for uncleanness when was the last
[17:42] time you were really thirsty i mean
[17:43] really thirsty and how did you feel when
[17:46] you finally got to some liquid water
[17:48] praise god that's what's going to happen
[17:50] they're going to be so thirsty for
[17:51] righteousness they're going to feel
[17:53] guilt and shame and mourning but all of
[17:56] a sudden god is going to open a fountain
[17:58] a fountain is going to break forth and
[18:00] all the forgiveness is just going to
[18:02] wash over them and they're going to feel
[18:04] clean and washed and they're going to
[18:06] feel oh now we can accept it
[18:08] we're sorry we did that but we accept
[18:10] him now we receive our messiah we thank
[18:13] god for the messiah we accept jesus
[18:16] christ and the bible said they get
[18:17] washed and clean the bible says they are
[18:20] forgiven on the day of atonement
[18:24] i didn't hear you praise god the bible
[18:26] said they get the seal on the forehead
[18:29] hallelujah
[18:30] and that my friends was on mount zion
[18:33] that's where they get born again i was
[18:34] in there on mount sinai singing the song
[18:37] the way they do after they weep and cry
[18:38] they start singing the song of moses
[18:40] they start singing the song of zion amen
[18:43] they start praising god so see it's just
[18:45] like you when you got the baptism
[18:47] you weep you cried but then you started
[18:49] shouting and screaming and praising the
[18:51] lord singing the songs of god see every
[18:54] child of god is born the same way
[18:58] this is a regular old pentecostal server
[19:00] saying ahead amen
[19:03] oh that's beautiful
[19:05] isaiah 66 verse 8 said who has heard of
[19:08] such a thing who has seen such a thing
[19:11] shall the earth
[19:13] i'm sorry
[19:14] shall the earth be made to bring forth
[19:17] in one day or shall nation be born at
[19:19] once as soon as zion travailed she
[19:23] brought forth her children
[19:25] see it was a birth it was a travail oh
[19:28] my uh we saw the problems go up and and
[19:31] now rome and the pope might be after us
[19:33] and who knows there's just gonna be a
[19:34] lot of pressure right there's gonna be a
[19:36] lot of burp pains i'm not sure on the
[19:37] order of all these things but there's
[19:39] gonna be a lot of pain oh look what
[19:40] we've done look for 2000 years we've
[19:43] rejected him oh but then all of a sudden
[19:46] forgiveness jesus will speak mercy to
[19:48] them
[19:49] he said god did it for a purpose just
[19:52] like joe joseph
[19:54] oh don't don't be upset against
[19:55] yourselves you're forgiven god invited
[19:58] you to get a gentile bride
[20:01] and she's in heaven right now waiting
[20:03] for me
[20:13] oh my
[20:14] church when they receive christ in their
[20:16] seat with the holy ghost and they sing
[20:18] and rejoice three of gabriel's six
[20:22] uh items have been fulfilled
[20:26] they finished the transgression there's
[20:27] no more transgression against israel
[20:29] they made an end of sin there are no
[20:31] more sins because they're under the
[20:32] blood of jesus and they've made
[20:34] reconciliation for all of that iniquity
[20:38] think about that 2 000 years of iniquity
[20:40] member iniquities going right and then
[20:42] still doing this lawlessness right
[20:44] uh having no fear of god
[20:46] finally there's a no more transgression
[20:49] there's the end of sins and there's a
[20:52] reconciliation
[20:53] for iniquity finally israel has received
[20:57] a new covenant amen ezekiel said you're
[20:59] going to write it on the fleshy tables
[21:01] their heart they turned it down all
[21:03] these years but finally israel accepts
[21:06] her new covenant praise god
[21:08] what a blessing it's her spiritual
[21:10] birthday 144 000 born in one
[21:14] my day
[21:16] that's what i call blessing praise god
[21:20] mercy
[21:23] now
[21:25] church for us
[21:27] our day of atonement came
[21:29] uh when we were born again of the holy
[21:31] ghost
[21:32] right the bible says repent be baptized
[21:34] in 238
[21:37] now the word repent means the absorber
[21:41] that's why so many people fall away from
[21:43] the message they never really hate their
[21:45] old sin
[21:46] they just leave it for a little while
[21:48] they just do it a little bit and then
[21:49] pretty soon they can't overcome it then
[21:51] they go back to it
[21:53] right they never really repented he said
[21:55] if you really repented it'd be like the
[21:57] circumcision it'd be cut off
[22:00] right you wouldn't wouldn't go back to
[22:01] it anymore i'm not talking about minor
[22:03] sins both have some fighters since i'm
[22:05] talking about the major sins
[22:07] right
[22:08] and so see repent if when we really get
[22:12] the holy ghost we repent and uh it's
[22:15] like our souls are afflicted right we
[22:18] hate our sin like zacchaeus hated his
[22:19] sin he'll make up for it
[22:22] and so see when we get born again the
[22:24] bible said in acts 5 32
[22:27] the holy ghost whom god has given to
[22:29] them that obey him praise god so see
[22:31] when we mourn for our sin and we're
[22:33] humiliated and we confess our sins and
[22:36] we're done we pronounce we're done with
[22:38] sin because of how much we love jesus
[22:40] we've obeyed him and he seals us and we
[22:43] have our spiritual day of atonement all
[22:46] the sins are washed away not for a year
[22:49] but for all eternity amen amen just for
[22:52] one year it's for all eternity yes you
[22:54] have to keep doing it you know in this
[22:56] present but god's not looking at so much
[22:58] depression he's looking at a finished
[23:00] word he said you already are sitting in
[23:02] heaven replacement he already said that
[23:04] you are a king and i pray son to god he
[23:07] said that your soul cannot sin because
[23:10] the seed remains that's what he said
[23:12] amen
[23:13] that's not what i said that's what he
[23:14] said praise god
[23:16] so the soul has the day of atonement
[23:19] amen
[23:22] that's glorious
[23:23] that's why we don't go through the
[23:24] tribulation church romans 5 11 says
[23:28] we joy in god through our lord jesus
[23:31] christ by whom we have now everybody say
[23:34] now
[23:35] now receive the atonement
[23:38] we got the day we have the atonement now
[23:42] in other words we are one with god
[23:44] because of the blood of jesus christ
[23:48] i've already had my day of atonement
[23:50] praise god christ has gone into the
[23:52] present the holy or the friends of god
[23:54] and the holy spirit and he sent us a
[23:56] life back upon me praise god i've had my
[23:59] atonement
[24:00] right i'm sorry romans 5 11 says not
[24:03] future
[24:04] now we got the atonement now we are one
[24:07] with god now we're seated in heavenly
[24:10] places now we have every spiritual
[24:12] blessing in christ jesus
[24:14] thank god
[24:17] what happened if that is grace god
[24:19] to know that we now receive the
[24:21] atonement we're not waiting for it
[24:23] israel's waiting for we've received it
[24:25] praise god
[24:27] now this day of atonement actually
[24:29] started on the day of pentecost remember
[24:32] jesus raised from the dead and he said
[24:34] mary magdalene touched me not for i not
[24:37] yet ascended to my father
[24:39] so jesus could not be touched because
[24:42] his sacrifice had to be accepted by the
[24:44] father
[24:45] and this is the type of the red heifer
[24:48] anyone who touched the red heifer would
[24:50] be unclean right because all the sin was
[24:52] placed upon it right
[24:54] but here jesus is our red heifer praise
[24:57] god he could not be touched he said
[24:59] touch me not and so we know that jesus
[25:02] ascended now hebrews 9 11 and 12 tell us
[25:06] what he did
[25:07] i'm going to skip ahead a little bit in
[25:08] this reading
[25:10] he said neither by the blood of goats
[25:12] and calves but by his own blood he
[25:14] entered in once into the holy place
[25:17] having obtained eternal redemption for
[25:20] us he already obtained it praise god the
[25:23] atonement has already been received it's
[25:26] been accepted we are redeemed praise god
[25:38] so once the heavenly father accepted him
[25:40] he accepted the sacrifice of jesus
[25:42] christ he secured our redemption
[25:45] the sacrifice has been received god god
[25:48] and the invisible looked at the son
[25:50] somehow and said we accept the blood of
[25:52] we accept your blood
[25:54] heaven accepted the payment for your
[25:56] sins i don't make somebody shout or say
[25:58] amen yeah heaven already accepted for
[26:01] the blood and forgiveness for our sins
[26:05] heaven already did it
[26:06] in fact jesus don't touch me i gotta
[26:09] first be accepted and then hebrews 9
[26:11] said he was accepted he obtained it so
[26:13] that means he had something so when he
[26:15] come down back down and he showed
[26:18] himself to his disciples he had
[26:20] something he had forgiveness he had
[26:22] atonement he said don't feel bad about
[26:24] yourself he said but go away until
[26:27] you're endued with power from on high
[26:29] amen
[26:32] he didn't say well i'm getting rid of
[26:33] these 11 other disciples because they're
[26:35] not worthy to be atoned for no that's
[26:38] what the blood was for the blood was to
[26:41] atone for sinners
[26:43] the blood was to atone for disciples
[26:45] that made mistakes right that's what the
[26:47] blood was for praise god but the blood
[26:49] here make sure you're still one even
[26:52] though peter denied him three times he
[26:54] had that
[26:56] heaven
[26:58] oh thank god
[26:59] don't know about your mistake
[27:01] i mean you're gonna be
[27:03] worse than peter there i mean
[27:11] mercy for god loves to show mercy he
[27:14] delights in mercy praise god the thing
[27:16] to do is say thank you lord receive the
[27:18] atonement amen
[27:20] said you could have a gallon of oil
[27:22] poured on you he said you can have
[27:24] people speak in tongues and pray over
[27:25] you but if you never accept the
[27:27] atonement you'll never be forgiven
[27:29] you've got to accept it and say thank
[27:31] you jesus i am now
[27:38] oh thank god praise god amen
[27:41] that's when our young people need to
[27:42] have a day of atonement where they know
[27:44] all their sins are washed away
[27:47] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[27:49] praise god the sacrifice
[27:51] the sacrifice work of jesus is already
[27:55] done he's in a new body and then he can
[27:58] be touched right
[27:59] this is exactly what he did to atone for
[28:02] sins praise god
[28:04] hallelujah
[28:06] now
[28:08] the bible says there's no condemnation
[28:10] to them that are in christ
[28:13] see people misunderstand brother rams
[28:14] quotes he said uh and he was talking
[28:17] about how how if people don't do
[28:19] missionary work they might be judged or
[28:21] if they don't do enough work or it might
[28:23] be someone's fault you know that that
[28:25] somebody wouldn't hear possible
[28:27] if you are a holy ghost will say there
[28:29] is no condemnation against you
[28:32] now you might not if you didn't do all
[28:34] your part you might not get the reward
[28:36] you were hoping for
[28:37] but you're still caught by the blood of
[28:39] jesus christ holy holy satan's bad
[28:42] rewards please god it depends how much
[28:44] you invested in those rewards or those
[28:46] gifts rather but there's no condemnation
[28:49] we'll have no condemnation on that day
[28:51] because the bible says that's what the
[28:53] spirit of god does it takes away all
[28:56] guilt because that was all placed on
[28:58] christ amen amen
[29:01] church i know i fall short i know i make
[29:03] mistakes but i am trusting in the blood
[29:05] of jesus christ that has now i've now
[29:08] got the atonement and now there's no
[29:10] condemnation in me as long as i repent
[29:12] as long as i come back to the cross as
[29:15] long as i come back to kill god
[29:17] as long as i come back to kill god where
[29:19] i remember where god circumcised me he
[29:22] brought me in the promised land that for
[29:24] sure god will say well done with our
[29:27] hearts
[29:29] i will say that believes on me have
[29:31] already passed from death unto life
[29:36] our lives should be speaking a totally
[29:39] different testimony than before we say
[29:41] we got the holy ghost
[29:43] right it should be a brand new life
[29:45] brand new testimony praise god
[29:48] that's what the word of god does the
[29:50] soul is sealed to the day of redemption
[29:53] but yet you've got redemption
[29:56] i don't know your soul's got redemption
[29:58] but the rest of your body your spirit
[30:00] and your body must be redeemed in a
[30:02] glorified body and a theophany and
[30:05] physical all together in one praise god
[30:08] hallelujah
[30:10] well there we go now one more thing i'm
[30:12] sure make sure we get this
[30:14] when those 144 000 get the holy ghost
[30:17] the bible said their first fruits unto
[30:20] god
[30:21] and to the land that's in uh revelation
[30:24] 14 verse 4.
[30:26] this is the son of man reefing the
[30:28] harvest of the earth amen we already got
[30:31] the wheat harvest at the rapture but
[30:34] here he comes down from heaven to that's
[30:36] why he's descending one more time he's
[30:38] got to get the fruit harvest and come
[30:40] down and seal the 144 000 they're called
[30:42] the first fruits unto god amen
[30:47] hallelujah
[30:50] revelation 14 the bible said the
[30:53] gathering of the vine
[30:55] is done by the son of man jesus christ
[30:57] he gathers the vine the holy vine that's
[31:00] been grafted back into the holy tree
[31:01] right
[31:03] and it's destruction and then the or the
[31:05] world rather is destruct destroyed
[31:08] through the wrath of god
[31:10] all because they took the mark of the
[31:11] beast now church let me say something
[31:14] i don't know if you saw this did you see
[31:15] yesterday with these uh there's some uh
[31:18] government workers in texas they're
[31:21] democrats
[31:22] this is all leading to the mark of the
[31:24] beast from what we can see
[31:26] there's some democrats that left the
[31:28] capital they were called there to vote
[31:30] but they left and they
[31:32] they they went on a plane drinking beer
[31:35] to uh to
[31:37] the capital washington dc and according
[31:40] to texas law they can be arrested
[31:42] because they left at a time where they
[31:43] need to be in session voting on a loss
[31:48] and then texas government voted all the
[31:51] senators everybody voted to have their
[31:53] arrests
[31:54] for their arrest now look at that
[31:57] that's look they're threatening arrests
[31:59] you got this
[32:01] our country's being so divided
[32:03] politically and now they're threatening
[32:05] to rest
[32:06] on a big scale
[32:09] and that's why that's why these sinners
[32:11] hate donald trump because he said he was
[32:13] going to lock up hillary clinton you
[32:14] remember that lock her up i don't know
[32:15] if you remember that
[32:17] he never did
[32:19] but that was the big threat that's why
[32:20] they hate him
[32:22] because they
[32:24] of course he's not a good he's not even
[32:25] a christian
[32:27] but they hate him because he's
[32:28] threatening to lock up these sinners
[32:31] that have the mark of the beast because
[32:33] you can have the mark now
[32:35] right you can have the mark of god now
[32:37] you have a mark of the beast now but
[32:39] there's coming one final mark right
[32:42] but brother said you can have the mark
[32:44] of the beast now just like you can have
[32:45] the seal of god now
[32:48] so see i'm just catching these things in
[32:50] the news
[32:52] so the conservatives are threatening
[32:55] jail
[32:56] but those those evil demon-possessed
[32:59] leftists you and you know how they're
[33:01] all liars
[33:02] most of them are liars
[33:05] well we don't know what's going to
[33:06] happen with this situation with these
[33:08] texas house of representative people
[33:10] that left but i'll tell you this it
[33:12] looks like what it looks like from the
[33:13] scripture the left ones are actually
[33:16] going to turn around eventually and
[33:17] threaten the conservatives with jail
[33:20] they're going to return it
[33:22] and that's what's that's what's going to
[33:24] be very similar to the mark of the beast
[33:26] we don't know when we don't know how
[33:28] close we are
[33:29] but i just noticed that i thought wow
[33:31] look at that
[33:32] now we have threats about jail
[33:35] over
[33:36] just dereliction of duty and you know
[33:38] whenever you go against satan satan's
[33:40] gonna bring it right back against them
[33:42] right
[33:44] so just watch that watch that
[33:46] i've never seen this this divided or
[33:48] serious
[33:49] now they're threatening lawmakers to
[33:52] jail just because they won't vote
[33:54] because they know that they'll lose the
[33:55] election because the
[33:57] laws will put into good voting uh
[34:00] standards
[34:02] but brother that's what probably says
[34:03] but says
[34:05] the churches and the government must
[34:07] unite to bring down the squeeze right
[34:09] and bring down this mark of the beast on
[34:12] everybody
[34:13] so it's really interesting that's
[34:15] starting to go to arrests and threats of
[34:17] arrest and taking your freedoms and your
[34:19] liberty i don't know if you saw it
[34:21] yesterday too but uh
[34:24] the
[34:25] the doctors who promote the covenant
[34:27] vaccines
[34:28] they're threatening now to read
[34:30] everybody's text messages and there's so
[34:33] they're gonna they're basically taking
[34:35] away uh freedom of speech
[34:37] and they're they're threatening to do
[34:39] that and to read everybody's text
[34:40] messages in case you say anything about
[34:42] the vaccine they can report to you
[34:44] that's that's they were talking about
[34:46] that right in the united states you see
[34:48] slowly but surely this beast this this
[34:51] catholic united states beast is eroding
[34:54] the rights of free speech away but
[34:57] they'll get we'll get so bad we'll be
[34:59] crying peace and safety peace and safety
[35:02] right that's what they'll be saying
[35:03] right about the time of the rapture
[35:05] peace and safety
[35:06] they got to have a reason to arrest and
[35:09] kill people who will take the mark
[35:12] and see how serious it's getting
[35:14] i've never seen this serious before
[35:16] like you never remember you know
[35:18] republicans saying uh
[35:20] put barack obama in jail that i mean
[35:22] that was just a few years ago you don't
[35:23] remember that
[35:24] it's getting starting to get more
[35:26] serious here
[35:27] we just gotta watch remember that god is
[35:30] with us we've got the atonement we've
[35:32] already been atoned for all of our sins
[35:34] are paid for we don't have to go through
[35:36] wrath because jesus already took the
[35:38] wrath of god for us amen
[35:40] now we might be going through a little
[35:41] bit of pressure but that's par for the
[35:43] course
[35:44] every christian every jew that's a real
[35:46] man of god a woman of god had to deal
[35:48] with pressure
[35:51] but you watch that i'm watching that
[35:53] closely
[35:54] are they really going to arrest these
[35:55] democrats that left texas or not because
[35:58] you know they're going to turn around
[35:59] and try to arrest
[36:00] somebody else
[36:02] you already know the church you know
[36:03] some of those people that stormed the
[36:05] capitol on january 6 are still in prison
[36:07] today
[36:08] and
[36:09] some of them didn't even do anything
[36:11] other than just come on the capitol
[36:14] that's awful
[36:15] see this government here you can start
[36:17] to see how they're infringing about
[36:19] people rights they don't care anybody
[36:21] says they got controlled in judges they
[36:23] paid off the judges they paid off
[36:24] politicians they paid off everybody so
[36:27] they have full control that's what they
[36:29] want they have power but they'll never
[36:31] have power over the bride of christ
[36:35] thank god
[36:37] if they shut our
[36:38] shut our doors if they shut our doors
[36:40] we'll still have church we'll stop
[36:41] church in our house or somehow you can
[36:43] have church at your house praise god or
[36:45] we can gather together somehow we'll
[36:46] find a way to get together praise god go
[36:49] find a way where god's people will be
[36:50] gathered together watching and waiting
[36:52] for the coming amen
[36:55] we're just privileged where we get to
[36:56] know a little bit about it before it
[36:58] comes
[37:01] see watch that church watch it not a
[37:03] threatening jail
[37:05] you know they're going to turn it around
[37:07] wait till biden and kamala or whoever it
[37:09] is the next ones wait till they start
[37:10] threatening people in jail
[37:12] about to get serious
[37:14] but that's okay george it's got to come
[37:16] down to this it's got to come down to
[37:17] where they're you know hunting and
[37:18] hunting and so close so close and so
[37:20] close to see the very left it's
[37:22] squeezing time it's almost down it's
[37:23] almost to the squeezing point right
[37:25] it's got to be real serious life and
[37:27] death and in jail and freedom it's got
[37:28] to come down to that so we're watching
[37:30] that and we're just prepared i'm saying
[37:32] jesus i'm watching for your coming and i
[37:33] sure am praying
[37:35] praise god
[37:37] now the last one we've gone to the
[37:39] trumpets the day of atonement
[37:42] they left forgiven all the sins were
[37:44] given the last feast of the year was
[37:46] tabernacles
[37:49] this was a day of celebration
[37:52] after the final harvest of the year
[37:54] began on the fifth day
[37:57] right so this was five days after the
[37:59] day of atonement they finished all their
[38:01] fruit gathering they gathered in all the
[38:04] fruits and then god said build temporary
[38:07] booths made of tree branches and
[38:09] remember
[38:11] how god made israel to dwell in boots
[38:14] after their exodus from egypt
[38:17] each day had its own burnt meat and
[38:20] drink offerings beside all the daily
[38:22] offerings
[38:24] on the eighth day they had a special
[38:27] sabbath it was a final offering made by
[38:30] fire as a solemn assembly and holy
[38:33] convocation on that last day they
[38:36] finally had permission to go back to
[38:38] their permanent homes
[38:39] [Music]
[38:41] so seven days in temporary boots and on
[38:44] the eighth day they got to go back one
[38:46] major sacrifice one sacrifice they go
[38:49] back to their permanent homes
[38:52] for church this is prophetically
[38:54] fulfilled in the millennium
[38:57] thousand-year millennium according
[38:58] isaiah 65 15 through 22 and revel 20
[39:02] verses 1-6
[39:04] the sun will have a peaceful reign this
[39:07] is a peaceful time this is a time of
[39:09] celebration seven days right
[39:12] seven days temporary homes praise god
[39:16] and so we see here that this is after
[39:18] the battle of armageddon right
[39:21] and it's now the harvest is totally
[39:23] complete there's no more harvest this is
[39:26] just rejoicing and what it's been
[39:28] harvesting amen
[39:29] oh god thank god the with the barley's
[39:32] been brought in christ has been
[39:34] harvested amen the wheat the gentile
[39:37] bride has been brought in and now the
[39:39] fruit the jewish president has been
[39:41] brought in and now we're just rejoicing
[39:43] all the harvests are complete let's
[39:45] rejoice in what we've harvested amen
[39:49] a thousand years
[39:52] of rejoicing over the harvest
[39:56] thank god
[39:58] now church to me i could be wrong in
[40:00] this
[40:01] i think the seven days of rejoicing
[40:05] represents god getting his seventh day
[40:07] of rest
[40:09] i could be wrong with this i've debated
[40:10] back and forth with my family in a
[40:12] loving way we kind of see this
[40:14] differently
[40:15] right but it don't matter because it
[40:16] don't apply to us really like they don't
[40:18] apply to us getting ready for the
[40:19] rapture
[40:21] so i believe in genesis one and two the
[40:24] six days i think the six days were
[40:26] actually six thousand years of creation
[40:28] i could be wrong that's what i believe
[40:30] because on the seventh day it was
[40:32] interrupted
[40:34] and so god needs to get another
[40:36] thousand-year
[40:38] day
[40:38] of rest because god never got it
[40:41] peter said one day with the lord is as a
[40:44] thousand years
[40:47] so see satan possessed the serpent
[40:49] begotten eve
[40:51] into eating the fruit
[40:53] shared it with adam it plunged mankind
[40:55] into sin bondage but now the bondage is
[40:58] broken praise god there's no more
[41:01] bondage to say
[41:04] something the conditions of eden
[41:08] are almost restored i'll say like that
[41:10] almost three stones
[41:12] almost because we know the future holds
[41:14] the ultimate restoration
[41:16] right
[41:18] and so the bible is out for a thousand
[41:20] years church we're gonna build houses
[41:23] and inhabit them according to isaiah 65
[41:26] we will plant vineyards and eat the
[41:28] fruit of them
[41:30] we got a bunch of those caterpillars
[41:32] that eat up all of our kale every year
[41:33] brother
[41:34] right don't think
[41:36] so we plant my wife plants all these
[41:38] seeds for kale we never get to eat the
[41:39] kale because those bugs we don't believe
[41:42] in spraying them except their pants are
[41:43] causing agents
[41:45] so we you know we got to have our own
[41:47] little garden and we plant sometimes but
[41:49] we don't get to eat from it but god said
[41:52] you'll build a house and you inhabit it
[41:54] praise god you will plant a vineyard and
[41:57] you'll eat of it no one else will live
[42:00] in your house or in habit but you will
[42:03] praise god
[42:04] and do the days are
[42:06] today my people shall all enjoy the
[42:10] works of their hands amen
[42:13] oh church more than a lifetime a
[42:15] lifetime is what
[42:16] we're blessed
[42:18] we get more than a lifetime we get to
[42:20] long enjoy the works of our hands
[42:23] imagine that a house that lasts a
[42:25] thousand years
[42:27] what kind of place would that be praise
[42:28] god and we get to enjoy it
[42:31] for a thousand years
[42:34] since that means brother we get to build
[42:36] houses
[42:37] go in and sleep in it well i don't know
[42:39] i'm sure we're going to sleep in the
[42:40] morning i have to check that i can't
[42:41] remember
[42:44] and then go out and rule the bible said
[42:46] rule and reign
[42:47] and then go back into the houses
[42:49] so we got time we got time to wake up
[42:51] you know
[42:52] we'll make some proclamations to the the
[42:56] servants right and then we got time to
[42:58] go out there to our vineyard check out
[42:59] our vineyard uh servants how the other
[43:01] vineyard do it how the grapes do it
[43:03] oh they're real big master they're like
[43:05] this
[43:06] just like in the promised land right let
[43:08] me know what the promise that except
[43:09] they'll probably be bigger than that but
[43:11] they'll be massive huge right huge
[43:14] we have time to instruct our our cities
[43:17] that we rule over our nations check up
[43:19] on our vineyards and go back in the
[43:20] house into our families
[43:23] don't have to go out we get to go out to
[43:25] our uh
[43:26] our zoos and check out how's the lion
[43:28] the lamb doing out here huh
[43:30] how you doing fellas
[43:31] ah come on here rub rub my leg you know
[43:34] i like how my cat my cat runs up and he
[43:36] just rubs against my leg you know
[43:38] a lion will rub up against the leg
[43:41] for a thousand years amen
[43:43] nothing we do will be in vain praise god
[43:47] hallelujah there'll be no evil thought
[43:49] come to our mind because the giver of
[43:51] those evil thoughts is chained up in the
[43:53] bottom of this pit praise god
[43:56] hallelujah there'll be no evil thoughts
[43:58] on how i can steal that
[44:00] i got to worry about being killed oh
[44:02] there's nothing like that it's just 1000
[44:05] years one day a saturday
[44:09] night
[44:11] the beast the tabernacles
[44:13] these hockeys are great but they're just
[44:15] temporary

[44:23] you live if you never got time
[44:29] what kind of and you'll do you won't
[44:30] you'll do that not just for one day
[44:32] but for a thousand years

[44:41] that brother

[45:08] it's gonna be such a joy and we're gonna
[45:10] remember how god brought us out through
[45:12] an exodus through a rapture praise god
[45:16] amen thank god
[45:18] that we'll have an exodus so remember oh
[45:21] god brought us out
[45:23] here we are
[45:24] we're in a holy place for a thousand
[45:26] years
[45:28] total joy total victory a church we we
[45:32] we're allowed to enjoy our lives over
[45:34] here
[45:36] go to first timothy 6 17. i just want to
[45:38] make sure i rehearse this
[45:41] first timothy 6 17.
[45:45] sometimes i get tempted to feel bad if
[45:47] i'm enjoying my life because i know
[45:49] people are suffering but the bible says
[45:51] god does give us gifts to enjoy in the
[45:53] new testament
[45:55] we just have to recognize that there's
[45:57] times and seasons to be happy and
[45:59] there's times and seasons to mourn right
[46:02] blessed are the pure in heart right
[46:04] blessed are those who mourn they should
[46:06] be covered we mourn a lot on sunday
[46:08] we pray
[46:09] for eight sisters
[46:12] remember they say
[46:14] rich in this world that they be not
[46:16] minded don't trust the uncertain riches
[46:18] but in the living god who giveth us
[46:20] richly all things to
[46:22] church enjoy the cards he got enjoy the
[46:25] house you got enjoy the food you gotta
[46:27] enjoy your job but don't trust in it
[46:31] send god amen
[46:33] there's nothing wrong with enjoying what
[46:35] we've got
[46:37] but then when we have a need come up
[46:39] when you feel the holy spirit is
[46:40] bringing up somebody from haiti or
[46:42] bringing up somebody from cuba that you
[46:43] can help out or somebody from overseas
[46:46] trying to help them out by the grace of
[46:47] god if you can if nothing else just pray
[46:50] for it
[46:53] i started doing something last month
[46:57] i just started doing this by the way
[46:59] somebody from haiti contacted me
[47:00] something from uh
[47:02] zimbabwe whatever they asked me for all
[47:05] kinds of money and all in the past
[47:06] always i just said i can't do anything
[47:08] but now i'm just sending them one time
[47:10] love off
[47:12] because if i can't give them the whole
[47:13] thing if one guy went in one thousand
[47:16] eight hundred dollars like you don't
[47:17] even own a church another guy asked me
[47:19] can you give me all this money to finish
[47:21] our church i'm like we don't even have
[47:22] our own church
[47:24] i mean i'd like to help you but
[47:27] and another guy was like uh yeah can you
[47:28] send me money so i can get the windows
[47:30] for my house
[47:32] i'm like brother
[47:34] i said i can't do that i said we don't
[47:35] even own church we rent at church and he
[47:38] emailed me back a couple months later
[47:39] he's like oh don't worry the lord
[47:40] provided the funds we got the window and
[47:42] i said well take the phone
[47:44] but
[47:46] just a woman in haiti i'm like well
[47:48] i can't give you all that you want but i
[47:50] can give you a little offer dude it's
[47:51] our time it's your time
[47:54] i use maybe a little over a tithe of the
[47:56] time
[47:57] just to pay for what my kids need you
[47:58] know as they get older they get more
[48:00] expensive right brother
[48:02] you know the older they get the more
[48:03] things they need that's fine but i've
[48:06] got the money right to enjoy it
[48:09] but i just made this recent change if
[48:11] they're hearing me on the livestream
[48:12] i'll probably get a lot more
[48:13] requests in the next few weeks
[48:16] but then i can only get what i got you
[48:18] know i can't give them what they want i
[48:19] can only give them what i got
[48:22] i just been more convicted about that
[48:24] recently just to give a little bit
[48:26] so i got my i got my western union
[48:28] account now i got
[48:30] go funding account i got all these
[48:31] accounts just to give a little bit like
[48:32] give a little bit so that's that's your
[48:34] ties and your offerings going to help
[48:35] out people too
[48:39] but the bible says church god gives us
[48:40] these things to enjoy
[48:44] but we must not forget first corinthians
[48:45] 12 that the bible says when one part of
[48:47] the body suffers all the body should
[48:49] suffer
[48:52] right that's why we're praying you know
[48:53] we pray so hard for different needs that
[48:55] we
[48:56] hear our first seed either
[48:57] the body of christ while we pray for the
[48:59] sister that was sister
[49:05] but we're trying to enter into our
[49:06] suffering right during that moment
[49:08] brains i feel like we're suffering with
[49:10] her i really felt like i'm great as
[49:11] sincere as i could for that
[49:14] woman that were burning so it's like
[49:16] constantly back and forth right the
[49:17] kingdom of god you know we got joy
[49:20] righteousness and holy ghost right we
[49:21] got all these joy righteousness peace
[49:23] and the holy ghost you know when there's
[49:25] times when we're rejoining our lives and
[49:27] then there's times we're mourning for
[49:28] people
[49:29] that's the life of a christian and
[49:32] when that in that time there'll be no
[49:33] more
[49:35] the millennium there'll be no morning
[49:36] there
[49:37] a thousand years to rule and reign with
[49:41] christ
[49:43] imagine a thousand years of anything you
[49:44] want
[49:46] just before
[49:48] right now of course god wouldn't give us
[49:50] that unless he could trust us with it
[49:53] see he knows we wouldn't be like satan
[49:55] satan said well
[49:56] i'm going to speak a throne above the
[49:58] throne of god that's what satan would do
[50:01] but we would never want that we would
[50:02] just when lord help me to be faithful
[50:04] with what you give me
[50:06] let me just so see he knows we would
[50:08] never ask for anything selfishly it just
[50:11] we have something to glorify god
[50:15] now church finishing off this
[50:18] the eighth day
[50:20] symbolize the beginning of the eternal
[50:23] covenant because a is the number of a
[50:25] new beginning
[50:27] the boy was circumcised on the eighth
[50:28] day because he's in a new beginning a
[50:30] new covenant the coming of abraham right
[50:33] there's all these eights in the bible
[50:35] represent eternity or i don't i can't i
[50:37] don't have the number eyes i wrote in
[50:39] the book everyone i don't have them
[50:40] memorized
[50:42] see this eighth day speaks that time is
[50:44] over we've broken into the cycle of
[50:46] seven seven days in a week when you go
[50:48] to the eighth day the cycle repeated we
[50:51] we're we're in the repeating unending
[50:54] cycles of eternity amen
[50:56] and it's no longer permanent holmes on
[50:58] the eighth day i'm sorry in separate on
[51:00] the eighth day you went from temporary
[51:03] to permanent so the eighth day
[51:05] represents the future home coming down
[51:07] from heaven that's our mother we finally
[51:10] get reunited with mama new jerusalem
[51:12] praise god in other words our motherland
[51:16] that's what it is our motherland we get
[51:18] united with the motherland heaven that's
[51:21] where we came from the mind of christ
[51:24] amen amen
[51:26] not like a mother like a nursing mother
[51:28] it's a mother like that's my brother
[51:29] land that's where i came
[51:31] that's where i came right now going back
[51:33] to that race
[51:37] thank god no more temporary homes
[51:41] so one day after those 365 000
[51:45] days are up brother william
[51:46] we'll
[51:47] close that door for the final time and
[51:49] say i don't know what we're doing we'll
[51:51] say somebody can have this home i'm
[51:53] going to my real home
[51:55] i'm taking a step higher i'm going up
[51:57] further up and further in praise god i'm
[52:00] going up further in i'm going to find a
[52:02] mansion with my name on it praise god
[52:05] he said cause i go to prepare a mansion
[52:08] for you praise god if it was not so i
[52:10] would have told you but i go to prepare
[52:13] a place that where i am there ye may be
[52:16] also amen
[52:18] [Music]
[52:20] living next and close to jesus christ
[52:23] amen
[52:24] what a privilege
[52:29] let me know there'll be a seat right let
[52:30] me see
[52:33] 24
[52:34] that's it
[52:36] something else
[52:41] let my son sit
[52:43] he said well they got to be baptized
[52:44] with the baptism i'm not god
[52:46] they said the father is the only one who
[52:48] knows who those things come to you
[52:50] but then you see in heaven 24 seats so
[52:52] it's probably those 12 apostles
[52:55] there's 12 sons of jacob please god
[52:58] see no more temporary homes
[53:01] at that point we can finally say
[53:05] i am at rest
[53:08] i've made it home
[53:12] everything done
[53:13] on earth will now be done like it was
[53:15] always done
[53:17] heaven will have come down to earth
[53:21] what a blessing
[53:24] let me close with this thought i'm going
[53:25] to close with what in revelation 7.
[53:28] and i got some quotes for this one
[53:32] the revelation seven nine revelation 79.
[53:36] i don't got work tomorrow
[53:47] i end the chapter in the book well not
[53:49] the very last thing but one of the last
[53:51] things i end with
[53:54] is on the mystery of the jew gentile
[53:56] church
[53:58] god was showing i'm going to make one
[54:00] people make one man one temple but here
[54:03] in revelation 7 we actually get to see
[54:05] that one body together we get to see
[54:08] that one temple
[54:10] together
[54:11] revelation 7 9.
[54:14] a lot of people say it's the foolish
[54:16] version church there's only one quote
[54:19] the brother man says in the foolish
[54:20] version there are six quotes
[54:22] where brother
[54:27] if you look at all the evidences it's
[54:28] gotta be the pride
[54:32] verse nine after this i beheld a law of
[54:34] great multitude which no man can number
[54:36] of all nations and kids and people and
[54:38] tongues stood before the throne of the
[54:40] four of the lamb clothed with white
[54:41] robes
[54:43] and palms
[54:44] in their hands
[54:48] yeah they got they already got it right
[54:53] the jews didn't get himself after the
[54:54] white durian judgment
[54:56] he's already died
[54:58] right
[54:59] verse 10 and cried with a loud voice
[55:01] saying salvation to our god would sit
[55:03] upon the throne and unto the lamb and
[55:05] all the angels stood round about look
[55:07] they're sitting on the throne
[55:09] right that's got to be the heavenly
[55:10] throne
[55:14] and about the elders and the four
[55:16] reasons
[55:17] it's the heavenly throne
[55:18] sometime after the rapture
[55:20] and fell before the throne in their
[55:22] faces and worshipped god amen hallelujah
[55:26] thank god this has got to be the bride
[55:28] saying amen blessing and glory and
[55:29] wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and
[55:30] power and might be our god forever amen
[55:33] and one of the elders answered them to
[55:34] me what are these which are raining
[55:36] white rose and what's came day and i
[55:38] said sir thou knowest and he said to me
[55:40] these are they which came out of great
[55:41] tribulation deep regulation without a
[55:44] great tribulation
[55:45] and have washed the robes and make them
[55:47] white in the blood of that these are
[55:49] people that know about the blood amen
[55:52] there they've been washed brother praise
[55:55] god they've received their atonement
[55:57] amen
[56:01] remember church the bush virgin they're
[56:03] not really a full partaker of the
[56:04] atonement are they that's what they have
[56:06] said anointed one to the end time they
[56:08] haven't fully got the atonement because
[56:10] they're not born again by the baptism of
[56:12] the holy ghost praise god but these have
[56:15] the atonement they got white robes on
[56:17] and they thank god for the blood see
[56:19] these are blood box saints
[56:25] ah
[56:26] verse 15 therefore are they before the
[56:28] throne of god and servant dave right and
[56:30] his temple and he that sitteth on the
[56:31] throne shall dwell among them they shall
[56:33] hunger no more neither shall they thirst
[56:35] anymore neither shall the sun light on
[56:36] them nor any heat
[56:39] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[56:40] the throne shall feed them and shall
[56:42] leave them
[56:56] we're just going to see a sea
[56:58] of white

[1:00:44] he's kept all those different uh saints
[1:00:47] from every color every nation every
[1:00:48] kinder every tongue he just looks out

[1:01:17] thank you jesus hallelujah
[1:01:21] jesus is one two gentile church his
[1:01:23] bride
[1:01:25] is now gathered in heaven
[1:01:27] and every seat is full remember he said
[1:01:29] make sure my house is full
[1:01:32] it's a full house
[1:01:34] it's a house full of saints from every
[1:01:36] nation every church age
[1:01:43] it wasn't easy
[1:01:44] the bible said that to make it through
[1:01:46] great
[1:01:47] tribulation
[1:01:49] remember church our persecution is more
[1:01:51] spiritual at least right now
[1:01:54] but saints under the age leading up
[1:01:57] right up to the philadelphian church
[1:01:58] that kind of changed everything
[1:02:00] it was mass murders up until about then
[1:02:02] then the bible said i'm opening a door
[1:02:19] they just started opening them but
[1:02:21] church remember all that live godly in
[1:02:22] christ jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:02:26] and what did brother ever say what was
[1:02:28] his worst
[1:02:29] hardest times in life was being rejected
[1:02:31] at the end of his ministry
[1:02:34] by preachers out in arizona
[1:02:37] he says in what house will you build me
[1:02:39] 1965. the man said i've suffered here
[1:02:41] like i've never suffered in my life
[1:02:46] so what was the hardest time of berlin's
[1:02:47] life the very end when he had all this
[1:02:49] revelation all this truth all thus saith
[1:02:52] the lord and yet rejected nobody calling
[1:02:55] nobody knocking on his door hardly
[1:02:57] anybody wanting to hear him preach just
[1:02:59] a few isolated churches around the
[1:03:01] country
[1:03:03] so we can see church our persecution may
[1:03:06] look different
[1:03:07] but we're still being persecuted
[1:03:09] by being rejected
[1:03:14] and that way we'll know christ in the
[1:03:15] fellowship of his son
[1:03:18] i'll say it like that just as jesus was
[1:03:20] abandoned
[1:03:21] he's got to be abandoned
[1:03:26] just like jesus had to be rejected
[1:03:36] praise god
[1:03:38] in church because this here that we'll
[1:03:40] close this because this church is from
[1:03:42] every nation there's got to be some jews
[1:03:44] in there
[1:03:45] if it's every nation proving there had
[1:03:47] to be a remnant it was blind
[1:03:51] right also i wish i could be
[1:03:56] paul wasn't blinded
[1:03:57] his eyes were open
[1:04:01] and here god's permanent
[1:04:03] nation is represented and now those
[1:04:05] words are fulfilled we can see it god so
[1:04:08] loved the world
[1:04:10] he so loved the world that he sent his
[1:04:12] message around the world to get a bride
[1:04:15] out of every nation
[1:04:17] anyone that wanted to be saved
[1:04:19] could be saved and was saved
[1:04:23] six quotes
[1:04:25] 1954.
[1:04:28] though there in quotes revelation 70
[1:04:30] says that's the bride where does mrs
[1:04:32] brown serve me at in the house that's
[1:04:34] the god
[1:04:36] quote number two 19 uh this is 1954
[1:04:39] again a few months later program reads
[1:04:41] revelation 7
[1:04:43] great tribulation see made fun of
[1:04:44] persecuted watch they're before the
[1:04:47] throne of god where does the queen say
[1:04:48] that's the bride and gentile bride
[1:04:53] they serve day and night my wife shows
[1:04:54] me how that's the pride of jesus that's
[1:04:56] the gentile bride
[1:04:58] 1960 the philadelphia church age he
[1:05:01] reads revelation 7 17 there there's the
[1:05:04] bride oh my how beautiful the bride
[1:05:08] number four the ten virgin there's your
[1:05:10] under now if you want to see the bride
[1:05:11] come up
[1:05:13] he says the seventh chapter
[1:05:15] he says
[1:05:17] here comes the bride what's your wife
[1:05:19] you serves you the house of god sit down
[1:05:21] and give you your food fixes it and this
[1:05:23] one all these nations the gentiles which
[1:05:26] is the bride before the throne of god
[1:05:31] number five 1964 after the seal
[1:05:34] remember in the seals he said the
[1:05:36] bullish version but before and after the
[1:05:38] seals he says bride so i'm going to get
[1:05:40] right
[1:05:42] revelation 7
[1:05:43] after that we saw coming up coming that
[1:05:45] great number was no american number
[1:05:46] which was the
[1:05:50] the number five the church of god
[1:05:51] configuration uh
[1:05:53] either they're the gentiles they'll be
[1:05:55] only sent to the jews
[1:05:57] and the last one god is talking about
[1:05:58] the bride here this is church book you
[1:06:00] want to see it want to see another
[1:06:01] picture of the bride revelation 7
[1:06:05] 4-17 and heard the number of them
[1:06:08] read to israel then he goes to the bride
[1:06:12] the one quote from foolish virginia's in
[1:06:13] the seventh field
[1:06:29] this scene was done in the tribulation
[1:06:31] period you see they wind up over there
[1:06:33] in revelation 7 between the 6th and the
[1:06:35] 10th
[1:06:36] that she had done first she's been given
[1:06:40] the one time brother said the school's
[1:06:42] closer six times
[1:07:09] give something
