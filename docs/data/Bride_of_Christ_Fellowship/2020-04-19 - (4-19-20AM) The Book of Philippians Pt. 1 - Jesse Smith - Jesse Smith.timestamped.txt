[0:00] we must remember ch's they're just small
[0:03] little message churches and these huge
[0:04] seas of Roman citizens you know and or
[0:08] Greek citizens like that you know this
[0:10] was of course a Greek it was a formerly
[0:12] Greek city but it was overtaken by
[0:15] Romans but they spoke Greek and so I had
[0:18] a lot of Greek traditions left over from
[0:20] you know the ancient Greeks and then
[0:23] Alexander the Great he was a Grecian
[0:25] King right Grecian ruler
[0:26] then came the Romans in so but just keep
[0:31] your spot there in you know acts 16
[0:35] because that's the beginning of this
[0:36] church it's wonderful to see how the
[0:38] church started I like see how little
[0:41] churches started because it makes me
[0:42] think of God started this little church
[0:44] praise God every everyone has their
[0:46] unique starting and God does a great
[0:49] work you know in all of them so you know
[0:53] Philip I is still a city in modern-day
[0:56] Greece today in Paul's day I'm sorry
[0:59] even to this day it's still the the
[1:02] second most populous area in Greece and
[1:05] I'll show a map here in just a moment
[1:07] I'll just show it now so this is the
[1:09] current Apple map I did an Apple map
[1:11] this morning on my phone and so Philip
[1:16] the second was Alexander the Great's dad
[1:19] and he found and he took over Philip I
[1:23] and then named it after himself
[1:25] Philip I Philip Philip I so he honored
[1:30] himself that's what most those kings do
[1:32] right they honor themselves and then his
[1:34] son was Alexander the Great so Philip
[1:37] built the city built a huge wall around
[1:40] Philip I this big city but then his son
[1:42] conquered the whole world Alexander the
[1:45] Great conquered the whole world
[1:47] and so there's modern-day Philip I today
[1:52] and you know this you know you can go to
[1:55] those places I showed you earlier you
[1:56] know that the forum the theatre they
[1:59] even have places where Paul was they
[2:02] have the the river where Lydia got saved
[2:05] she was the first convert in Philip I
[2:07] Lydia we got our little Lydia that's who
[2:09] she's named after right there
[2:11] praise God the first European
[2:13] convert that Paul ever had was Lydia
[2:16] from Philip I so it's a very historical
[2:19] place to be now just so you can see
[2:21] where it is in relation to where the the
[2:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost was first
[2:25] poured out in Jerusalem on the day of
[2:28] Pentecost and so Paul you know this was
[2:30] this was Paul's second missionary trip
[2:33] and so we'll get to that you know more
[2:36] on that in just a moment here but
[2:38] Alexander the Great
[2:39] you know his influence is it was major
[2:43] influence on the culture and the
[2:45] language because remember most of the
[2:47] New Testament was written in Greek
[2:48] where'd that come from it come from
[2:50] Alexander the Great because he conquered
[2:53] the whole world during that time and the
[2:55] Romans used the Greek language so most
[2:58] of the New Testament is written in Greek
[3:00] right Greek or Aramaic and so as you can
[3:04] see how God used even though Alexander
[3:07] the Great wasn't a believer he wasn't a
[3:09] Jew
[3:10] well you can see how God so used him to
[3:12] help shape the rest the rest of that
[3:15] historical time he's remember he was
[3:17] part of that image that Daniel saw right
[3:20] the head of gold was Babylon and then
[3:23] the chest was Medes of Persians and then
[3:26] the Grecian so like the belt the the
[3:28] middle area here was Alexander the Great
[3:31] and then the feet was Roman so God was
[3:34] using you know God uses all things for
[3:37] his glory
[3:38] praise God hard times good times great
[3:41] times
[3:41] evil men good men bad men good good
[3:44] women God uses all things for his glory
[3:46] praise God because he has foreknowledge
[3:48] he can work out everything all together
[3:50] for his glory and for his honor praise
[3:53] God that's why the Bible said God
[3:55] hardened Pharaoh's heart in order to
[3:57] magnify in order to bring out Israel of
[4:00] Egypt because God knew he'd never repent
[4:02] to begin with I read I read this week in
[4:05] numbers where God hardened the hearts of
[4:07] those Moabites where they wouldn't let
[4:10] Israel pass through but then Moses and
[4:13] come through and destroyed him because
[4:15] because God was pouring out his judgment
[4:17] upon them the Bible said God hardened
[4:19] their hearts because God was going to
[4:21] use vessels for his glory
[4:23] but vessels for his wrath I want to be a
[4:25] vessel for God's glory
[4:27] got a man I want to yield myself to
[4:29] God's holy spirit that God can do good
[4:31] things through me praise God that I'll
[4:33] be a vessel used for his glory for his
[4:36] honor for his praise a vessel meat for
[4:39] the Masters huse praise God so God uses
[4:42] all these vessels out into the great
[4:44] Philip and all these he makes them all
[4:46] work together for his glory and then you
[4:49] know about 400 years later after you
[4:51] know Alexander the Romans come and they
[4:54] they renovate the whole city because it
[4:56] was Grecian and they renovate it they
[4:59] keep the language but they renovated
[5:00] they be able to theater pagan temples
[5:03] they did all kinds of sports venues and
[5:05] public baths you know the Romans were so
[5:07] sensual they were so evil that they just
[5:09] bathe out naked in public in front of
[5:12] everybody so this evil culture within
[5:15] this evil culture as we saw even
[5:17] theevans God had a little message group
[5:20] that was faithful to Paul's teaching
[5:22] that was faithful to the prophet of God
[5:24] amen
[5:25] that's what we are today we're faithful
[5:27] to God's prophet brother Branham as he
[5:29] pointed us back to Paul's gospel praise
[5:32] God and we're resting on that we're
[5:35] resting on Paul's gospel amen hallelujah
[5:38] so let's give it a little more
[5:39] background here now let me do the
[5:42] timeline I'd like to go just to give you
[5:44] a timeline of the history and pause
[5:46] three missionary trips I don't have all
[5:49] this but I want to get it done maybe
[5:51] knit maybe this week so Paul's first
[5:54] missionary journey was from 47 to 49
[5:56] remember the Holy Ghost fell in 30 ad
[5:59] yeah right so this is 17 years later you
[6:04] know Paul's finally cuz remember he said
[6:06] he when he first got saved he first got
[6:08] the Holy Ghost he said I didn't go to
[6:10] any man he said I went out in the desert
[6:13] to hear from Christ myself hey man I
[6:15] don't know you amen so he went out there
[6:17] for years he was there years in Arabia I
[6:19] think three years or maybe longer and
[6:21] then I think he said he waited 13 years
[6:23] before he went up to Jerusalem to talk
[6:24] to Peter and James and all the the men
[6:27] of God up there cuz Paul like brother I
[6:29] said Paul wanted it absolute for himself
[6:32] praise God he knew Peter was a man of
[6:34] God and these but but he had to know
[6:36] Christ for himself amen
[6:38] and so do you and I we need to know
[6:40] ice for ourselves praise God and there's
[6:42] there's quite years where there's quiet
[6:44] years where Paul was not preaching when
[6:46] he was just studying and training up
[6:48] right like Ezra Ezra was that trained
[6:50] priest he was just all those years
[6:52] decades of just dedication just learn
[6:54] the word nothing really big going on
[6:56] just learn the word and then when God
[6:58] wants to use you in a great way God will
[7:00] use you in a great way praise God
[7:01] but there's years of training there's
[7:03] years of growing there's years of
[7:05] molding and shaping praise God
[7:07] and God you know helping us grow and
[7:11] grace and knowledge of the Lord and so
[7:13] we see this with Paul his first trip
[7:15] missionary I believe that's where the
[7:17] church at Galatia was started like I
[7:19] said I didn't have time to go through
[7:20] all this but it's on his second
[7:22] missionary journey that he makes this
[7:24] trip to Philippi and it's in chapter 16
[7:28] as we said and that's when it was
[7:31] established now the real reason I'm
[7:33] showing you this is because Paul doesn't
[7:35] write the letter this Philippians letter
[7:37] until 11 years after the church was
[7:40] started okay now our church I think our
[7:44] 14th anniversary is a couple months in
[7:46] June so praise the Lord but Paul here he
[7:50] starts the church through the leadership
[7:53] of God and and then you know he doesn't
[7:56] actually write this letter till later
[7:58] and then you know we see he goes on to
[7:59] his third missionary final and
[8:01] missionary journey and then he gets
[8:05] arrested in Jerusalem and then he has
[8:08] house arrest in Rome that's a beautiful
[8:11] chapter in Acts chapter 28 such a
[8:14] beautiful chapter the Bible said for two
[8:15] years he sat in a hired house it's kind
[8:17] of like it's kind of the Roman
[8:19] government bought him an apartment and
[8:20] then the Bible said he was chained up
[8:22] but yet he got to the Bible said he got
[8:24] yet all these privileges he got to have
[8:25] all these people come in and they were
[8:27] just it's like God just set him there
[8:28] and just set all these people to witness
[8:30] he got the witness to people and God
[8:32] just sent him right to his door praise
[8:33] God what a beautiful time I'm just
[8:35] searching the scriptures and getting a
[8:37] chance to witness because remember
[8:38] Paul's greatest requests at the end of
[8:41] his life there as he wrote the Ephesus
[8:42] was that God would open a door that
[8:45] could speak the mystery of God with
[8:48] boldness that was Paul's main desire he
[8:50] had the baptism Holy Ghost he saw
[8:52] miracles
[8:53] the pillar of fire but his main desire
[8:55] was god help me to be bold to share the
[8:57] mystery of the gospel with all those
[8:59] that will hear it
[9:01] Amen so church what is our greatest
[9:03] desire today just to share the message
[9:05] with people praise God just to see a
[9:07] soul save to help people yeah we want to
[9:10] see God do great things but the greatest
[9:12] thing is someone being saved from their
[9:14] sins praise God going from a sinner to a
[9:17] saint
[9:18] praise the Lord amen and so I think this
[9:21] gives us a good kind of historical
[9:24] background so we can begin understanding
[9:26] this letter to the Philippians and I I
[9:30] want to go back even do the Galatians 1
[9:32] I want to put Galatians and Ephesians in
[9:34] here
[9:34] I know Ephesians came right after
[9:36] Philippians so right after Philippians
[9:39] then Paul went up to Ephesus as well and
[9:41] then you know Paul writes all those
[9:42] letters the Fiji letter they all wrote
[9:45] him from his prison stay a lot of those
[9:47] letters written during his prison stay
[9:48] in Rome ok now I want to just just read
[9:53] a few quotes to you here but rants I'd
[9:55] like to speak to you on faith cometh by
[9:56] hearing I love this word the Word of
[9:58] Faith now we think of faith what is Paul
[10:00] first speaking the Romans which would
[10:02] have been heathens idolaters had just
[10:04] come over Christianity and Paul here is
[10:07] the greatest missionary the world has
[10:10] ever had since Christ hunters that's ass
[10:14] quite a statement because Jesus only
[10:16] traveled a hundred miles in his whole
[10:18] life a hundred miles is not very far
[10:22] right I think I got to go 101 is 160 to
[10:26] go back home to where I was where I was
[10:28] born you know I think it's a hundred
[10:29] sixty miles and we're not mistaken but
[10:32] Jesus hardly traveled as far as distance
[10:35] wise hardly traveled at all yet he was
[10:37] the greatest missionary there ever was
[10:39] amen why cuz he had power he had
[10:42] obedience praise God he never disobeyed
[10:45] the Holy Spirit one time amen
[10:47] so even though Jesus hardly traveled as
[10:50] far as miles wise he was the greatest
[10:52] missionary because he kept God's Word
[10:55] amen
[10:56] I don't know yeah but I wonder I want
[10:58] you to see that bo-ram calls Paul the
[11:00] greatest missionary in other places I
[11:01] want you to see this quote because
[11:03] nobody was greater than Christ
[11:06] and I know that's the move of the hour
[11:07] to exalt brother branham so I want to
[11:09] just make sure that spirit doesn't slip
[11:11] in here praise God because we've already
[11:12] had it tried to slip in here you know a
[11:14] couple months ago but that's why we
[11:17] always exalt Jesus Christ he's our
[11:19] absolute he's the name above all names
[11:20] amen
[11:22] now look what he says though this is
[11:24] where he says he said I just think of
[11:26] that that little Jewish brother Paul he
[11:28] just couldn't set still yet there was
[11:30] thousands in Jerusalem hadn't been
[11:32] converted but he had to go somewhere
[11:33] else or somewhere else the whole world
[11:36] must hear about the gospel as far as
[11:39] Paul could take it and how did he and
[11:42] how he did his best to brint
[11:45] and his messages and his writings still
[11:47] lives on immortal today because he spoke
[11:50] of Christ Jesus amen see how God God
[11:54] will God will make your character and
[11:57] your your mind the way he wants you to
[12:01] be for the Gospels sake in other words
[12:04] Paul he just couldn't sit still he had
[12:06] to go from this city to the next city
[12:08] and if you look at his ministry Church
[12:09] if the reason that happened was because
[12:12] he'd get persecuted so much they'd hate
[12:15] him they'd want to kill him right so he
[12:17] had to he had to be used to being able I
[12:19] just can't sit still I got to travel
[12:20] here I got to travel there brother man
[12:22] says the same thing many times he said
[12:24] his wife called him restless winds
[12:27] because he would get home he'd be happy
[12:29] to be home for a few days he said he'd
[12:30] be out mowing the grass he'd see a plane
[12:32] fly over and same I really like to go
[12:34] with that pilot somewhere preach the
[12:36] gospel he just couldn't sit still so
[12:39] that was his makeup he said not he said
[12:41] I never make a successful pastor he said
[12:43] because I don't have the makeup to do it
[12:46] now of course he might have been humbly
[12:49] I think he would have been a faith he
[12:50] was a faithful pastor for 17 years but
[12:53] that was just maybe him being humble but
[12:56] he had a certain a desire he just wanted
[12:58] to go he just wanted to go places now
[13:02] Church as far as me a pastor I love
[13:04] staying at home I really don't like
[13:05] traveling I get I get it now maybe it's
[13:07] cuz I have so many kids but when I
[13:08] travel I get so worn out and so God made
[13:13] me I love being home you know the
[13:14] children were kind of saying yesterday
[13:16] oh you know maybe we should move and I'm
[13:18] like I don't want to move
[13:19] being here I love accurate I love I love
[13:22] me I don't want to move I don't like
[13:23] packing up and but you know some people
[13:25] are built for that praise God
[13:28] but Paul was built where he had to just
[13:32] go take it out praise God member he was
[13:34] shipwrecked that's what three times or
[13:35] five times he was whipped three times I
[13:37] believe shipwrecked maybe three or five
[13:39] times he you know so that wouldn't now
[13:43] that might discourage you and I if we
[13:45] were gonna go on a missionary trip with
[13:46] amen and we got to the airport and they
[13:48] shut down all our flights we might be
[13:50] discouraged now we might not right man
[13:53] we might not someday Lord willing if we
[13:55] ever go back to Laos or something we
[13:56] don't see what that will see what the
[13:57] Lord does never know we must not put
[13:59] anything past the Lord but you know
[14:02] something like that might discourage
[14:04] some people from going but Paul if we
[14:07] had a hard time he's like I'll don't
[14:08] bother me I must preach elsewhere praise
[14:11] God he was built that way he was built
[14:15] to be a traveler or a great missionary
[14:17] to take the gospel to someone else were
[14:19] here at praise God
[14:20] now why was he like that because he knew
[14:23] Jesus and told him he said you are the
[14:25] the ministry of a dispensation to the
[14:28] Gentiles and he said you are going to
[14:30] turn many people from darkness the power
[14:33] of darkness
[14:33] to the power of light that was his
[14:36] commission amen
[14:37] he knew that Jesus was with them to do
[14:40] great things but he knew at the end of
[14:42] his life he was gonna have to suffer for
[14:44] Christ's name sake he knew he must come
[14:46] back to Rome because the brothers
[14:48] agamous had prophesied I think it was on
[14:50] his first missionary trip agamous is
[14:52] prophesied he said the one whose girl
[14:54] I'm wearing has to go to Rome to die and
[14:57] Paul said why do you torment me why why
[14:59] do you say these things I know I must go
[15:01] give my life and so he was built in such
[15:04] a way God built him in such a way to be
[15:07] able to travel and sacrifice and take
[15:09] November he also had the gift where he
[15:11] didn't have he didn't have so much
[15:12] sexual passions right he had a giftie
[15:14] single and so he could travel from place
[15:17] to place he can meet sisters and and you
[15:19] know he kept his distance of course as a
[15:21] godly man but he wasn't tempted he was
[15:23] never really tempted at any point - oh
[15:25] I'd like to have a family I like to I
[15:27] really would like to get married in
[15:28] these things he didn't have that so see
[15:31] many times your gifts are all
[15:33] time your gifts match your calling in
[15:35] life amen now look what he says a
[15:40] missionary is not a person who changes
[15:43] as a nation to live now this is what
[15:46] I've said before I preach a little bit
[15:47] on missionaries a missionaries a person
[15:49] who goes and comes back Paul was the
[15:53] greatest missionary the world ever knew
[15:56] now outside of Christ right is that
[15:59] right if you just trained a man and send
[16:00] them all over there and make his home
[16:02] there and say he's all his life he just
[16:04] changed his Nations that's called a
[16:05] pastor right so if I was to move to
[16:09] whatever Japan or whatever you know
[16:11] tie-ups thing assignment Thailand
[16:13] assignment if Simon wasn't moved to
[16:14] Thailand and stay there and preach he
[16:16] would be a pastor he wouldn't be a
[16:17] missionary but he's trying to do
[16:19] missionary what he's trying to do
[16:20] missionary work now right now they have
[16:22] a big outbreak of kovin so he was tell
[16:23] me about that you know so there won't be
[16:25] much missionary work there right now as
[16:26] far as at least physically well that's
[16:28] what a missionary does he goes he starts
[16:31] a church sets him in order and he moves
[16:33] on the next one now an evangelist goes
[16:36] to churches that are already established
[16:38] and I've saved this before but most
[16:40] message missionary trips are not
[16:42] missionary trips they're evangelistic
[16:45] trips like most of my trips I went for
[16:47] trips to South America all of them were
[16:49] evangelistic except we had two times
[16:52] where I did get to preach mother vague
[16:53] out in this two times we're just out in
[16:56] the field and there's all these
[16:57] community houses around and people just
[16:59] come out and what's he doing what's he
[17:01] preaching about you know we all got to
[17:03] preach a little bit so on those four
[17:04] trips they were really evangelical trips
[17:07] not missionary trips except on the last
[17:09] one I said brother
[17:10] Maxwell can we please do missionary work
[17:12] you know I spent what 2000 on this
[17:15] ticket I just want to preach this
[17:16] someone had never heard it before so he
[17:18] set it up and somebody got saved from
[17:21] that and they got baptized I think the
[17:23] week after we left praise God amen
[17:25] so that so we did a little missionary
[17:28] work but not much and so like let me
[17:31] just give some names like brother bender
[17:32] odd or Jason to Mars these are guys
[17:34] sometimes they do like Jason to Mars
[17:37] will do like missionary work where he
[17:39] goes to a spot and they don't have any
[17:40] believers and they'll make believers
[17:42] right they'll make real believers
[17:44] they'll make converts
[17:46] now brother bender odd he's more like a
[17:47] evangelist right he'll just go to where
[17:50] there's already churches like Trinidad
[17:51] or South America or different places and
[17:54] so you got to watch that here he went
[17:56] out to watch to make sure that it's the
[17:58] right type of ministry that we're
[18:00] sending that's why I like to pour that
[18:01] in an assignment when he goes to
[18:03] Thailand or Craig when he went to Japan
[18:04] like to give him an offer because he's
[18:06] going where there's no churches and we
[18:08] believe in the evangelism I believe in
[18:10] that but I also believe in new in
[18:12] missionary work praise God to go where
[18:14] no one's gone before word there's no
[18:16] churches and and see if God's got any
[18:18] sheep there that want to hear the word
[18:19] of God amen he said that isn't a
[18:24] missionary missionaries from one place
[18:26] to another Paul went all the way around
[18:28] and come back and go out again all the
[18:32] way around and come back so Paul was a
[18:34] missionary they talked about this
[18:36] brother Joseph here
[18:38] Joseph Matt say I believe if I'm not
[18:39] mistaken now here's just a map of the
[18:44] scriptures that we read in acts 16 now
[18:49] I'm gonna go back to acts 16 11
[18:51] therefore loosing from trow as so Paul
[18:53] was there on a second missionary trip
[18:55] intro as he says we came with a straight
[18:59] course to samo Thracia
[19:02] and the next day to Neapolis so there
[19:06] must be some stop here I'm not sure
[19:08] where the stop was Sam throw Thracia I
[19:10] think I was in Annapolis and then he
[19:12] goes next verse 12 and from thence to
[19:15] Philippi which is the chief city of that
[19:17] part of Macedonia and a colonies is a
[19:21] Roman colony and we were that city
[19:23] abiding certain days and on the Sabbath
[19:27] we went out of the city by Riverside
[19:29] where prayer was want to be made and we
[19:32] sat down and spake under the women which
[19:35] resorted thither okay so there's this
[19:39] scripture that I just read so now you
[19:41] can kind of see now you have an idea of
[19:43] this missionary trip they just went for
[19:45] one place to another now if you got your
[19:48] Bibles let's go back here to acts 16
[19:53] verse 6 I want to just remind us of this
[19:56] that not all missionary
[19:58] work is led by God it has to be led by
[20:04] the Holy Spirit that's why you want to
[20:07] pray and fast before we send
[20:10] missionaries out right that's why Simon
[20:11] and I trust he does that in fact I need
[20:13] to have a conversation
[20:14] I just believe he does I'm not certain
[20:16] that each time he prays him fast but I
[20:19] believe he does I know the one each time
[20:21] you tell me he was praying for signs and
[20:23] asking he go in his prayer closet ask
[20:24] God to put these signs together if he
[20:26] wanted him to go and and God would
[20:28] answer he said just supernaturally God
[20:29] would answer yeah and and and show him
[20:33] God's will now acts 16 six now when
[20:36] they've gone through Friday uh and the
[20:39] region of Galatia and we're forbidden of
[20:46] the Holy Ghost to preach the word in
[20:48] Asia look at that and that's striking
[20:50] the Holy Spirit said don't go preach
[20:53] there don't go to Asia go elsewhere see
[20:59] in no matter where we are Church we
[21:00] always have to ask God Lord is this your
[21:03] will for my life see even with traveling
[21:06] Paul's got to say Lord is this the right
[21:08] way to go is this the right direction
[21:10] where I must go you must always find
[21:13] God's will now look at that I love this
[21:15] verse 8 and they passing by meisa came
[21:18] down to trow as I love this look how God
[21:23] directs our lives by dreams and visions
[21:27] like the one we'll get to we're good
[21:28] today
[21:29] brother Rams dream with the store up
[21:30] food sort the tapes that dream directed
[21:34] a couple years of his life me and so
[21:38] many times Hertz will have a dream will
[21:40] have a vision or something like that and
[21:42] that is to direct our lives we have to
[21:44] make sure it's the Holy Spirit so how
[21:47] did Paul deal with or how did God deal
[21:49] with this prophet Paul by vision verse 9
[21:51] and a vision appeared to Paul in the
[21:53] night there stood a man of Macedonia and
[21:56] prayed him saying come over in Macedonia
[21:59] and help us so the Holy Spirit says
[22:03] don't go to Asia so Paul says fine all
[22:06] right we'll just wait on the Lord he
[22:07] goes to sleep and God sends him the
[22:09] answer in the sleep praise God
[22:12] oh thank the Lord now I've heard just
[22:17] like just a common statement that this
[22:20] stream doesn't need a lot of
[22:21] interpretation does it like you have to
[22:23] look at symbols and say huh wonder what
[22:25] this means a man says come preach to us
[22:28] and that's how brother Branham was - he
[22:30] had different dreams about members his
[22:32] Fletcher's brothers brother-in-law his
[22:35] remember his Fletcher brother and all
[22:37] had a dream where he he went into he's a
[22:40] sinner he was alcoholic and he went into
[22:42] the church in the dream and repented and
[22:46] got saved and Fletcher told the dream to
[22:48] brother Branham he said you don't need
[22:49] any interpretation for that you're
[22:52] you're an alcoholic you need to repent
[22:54] and you need to come to the altar praise
[22:56] God many of our family members you know
[22:58] we need to come right here right where
[23:00] amen came to this altar right here
[23:02] praise God hallelujah where our children
[23:06] have come to the altar praise God to get
[23:09] saved amen to give their lives to God
[23:12] many of these things don't take a lot of
[23:14] interpretation some of them do verse 10
[23:19] after eating the vision immediately we
[23:20] endeavored to go into Macedonia
[23:22] assuredly gathering that the Lord had
[23:24] called us for to preach the gospel unto
[23:27] them what does God's heart God's heart
[23:30] is preached the gospel amen
[23:32] preach to the Lost give them a chance
[23:33] they hear the word of God
[23:35] now we're nowhere to you know I say it's
[23:37] very similar you know these days are
[23:39] very similar most people weren't
[23:41] Christians right there wasn't many
[23:43] people that would want to hear the word
[23:44] of God so in some ways their days are
[23:46] very similar verse 11 therefore
[23:49] loosening from trow as we came with a
[23:51] straight course to sam throw samuel
[23:54] Thracia and the next day to Neapolis all
[23:59] right now and then to philip i okay now
[24:02] on my slide i want to just share a few
[24:04] more quotes from other bram i think
[24:05] there'll be a help to you and i kinda
[24:10] want to
[24:11] tie this down together how this applies
[24:13] to us well you know what let me see here
[24:17] yeah let me just dive down to us and
[24:19] then we'll kind of close with this AK 16
[24:21] a little bit by God's grace so you know
[24:25] I've just was meditating this morning
[24:27] and studying and I'm just remembering
[24:29] these quotes quotes came back to my mind
[24:31] we're still listening to the the seven
[24:32] seals in our house
[24:33] we do about 10 minutes a night and so
[24:37] this thought last night came to me I
[24:38] remembered in the first seal brother
[24:40] Branham was reading he was reading 2nd
[24:42] Thessalonians chapter 2 about the
[24:43] Antichrist and he stops and says this
[24:46] statement about st. Paul he says I'd
[24:48] like to set under some of his teaching
[24:50] wouldn't you I love that because Paul
[24:53] was a teacher right use a teacher to the
[24:56] Gentiles and so Paul says a prophet says
[25:00] I'd like to sit under that prophet
[25:01] wouldn't you and the beautiful part of
[25:04] it is we get to read many of his letters
[25:06] that taught us the gospel praise God but
[25:10] man that says this next now listen
[25:15] closely before closing how can I escape
[25:16] your brother neither male nor female is
[25:19] accepted or dispelled you're all one in
[25:21] the sight of God when it comes to this
[25:22] how do you do it your heart as a womb
[25:24] you know what I'm speaking of men and
[25:25] women your heart is a womb and the womb
[25:27] holds the seed and the seed is the
[25:29] gospel now the seed alone is its heart
[25:32] no matter how many cameos you set under
[25:35] no matter how great your pastor is and
[25:37] how much you've read the Bible it'll
[25:40] never take life until the germ of life
[25:42] has come to it so no matter how great
[25:46] Paul was as a teacher no matter how
[25:48] great brother Brandon was as a teacher
[25:50] no matter how great any pastor there is
[25:52] today as a pastor the person themselves
[25:55] has to receive the seed of God amen and
[25:59] brother Branham was well aware that many
[26:02] people in his church had not been born
[26:04] again he says it right before he passed
[26:06] this is his last Easter sermon he says
[26:11] he's doing the altar call look it's the
[26:13] end of the chat it's under the sermon
[26:14] paragraph 333 he says is there anyone
[26:17] here or many who doesn't have this
[26:20] quickening power in you the sun has
[26:23] shined across
[26:25] you've sat in this Tabernacle you've
[26:27] listened to tapes and yet the spirit as
[26:29] never quicken you so you can follow all
[26:32] the Word of God amen
[26:34] that you women and you men could obey
[26:37] every word that's written praise God so
[26:41] see brother I'm saying people can listen
[26:42] to my tapes I can be their pastor I can
[26:44] be their prophet but they've still got
[26:47] to be born again praise God
[26:48] they still got to receive it praise God
[26:51] just hearing it as good hearing it's
[26:53] good but you've got to love it so much
[26:55] that you fall in love with it till it
[26:57] seals your soul praise God and then you
[26:59] love to obey it as well thank the Lord I
[27:03] love that quote praise God because all
[27:07] the tape people are saying the tapes are
[27:08] the absolute no you can listen to tapes
[27:10] and still not have the absolute the
[27:12] absolute is Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit
[27:15] praise God oh that's a decent that's a
[27:20] dangerous thing
[27:20] what if you be a dead seed no life in
[27:22] you but there's something in you that
[27:24] tells you I want to rise this morning I
[27:25] want to rise from the state that I'm in
[27:27] I don't want to be just a dead seed be
[27:31] left to dirt and driftwood I want her
[27:33] eyes praise God
[27:34] thank the Lord now you know since we're
[27:37] here go to acts 15 I was studying
[27:41] yesterday
[27:44] and there was just a great scripture I
[27:46] like to see if I can find that just kind
[27:48] of came strangely to my mind here yes
[27:52] okay now in Acts chapter 15 you might
[27:56] remember they had to have a counsel in
[27:58] fact a lot of churches try to mimic this
[28:01] today and they say well we're gonna have
[28:02] a counsel like the early church but of
[28:06] course they don't have the same baptism
[28:07] as Paul had right they still have father
[28:10] son Holy Ghost and so they can't be the
[28:12] real Church of God having a counsel
[28:13] because they got the wrong doctrine but
[28:16] in in this chapter Paul James Peter I'm
[28:20] sorry Paul modernists go to James and
[28:22] Peter they're in Jerusalem and they talk
[28:23] about the issue of circumcision because
[28:25] there was Jude Jewish Christians that
[28:28] were telling people Gentiles now you've
[28:30] got the Holy Ghost but you're not saved
[28:32] he said you might have had an experience
[28:33] but they say you're not saving - you're
[28:35] circumcised in your flesh and Paul says
[28:37] Paul said nonsense
[28:38] he said we need to go there and have a
[28:39] conference about it but I want you to
[28:41] notice here a Peter rises up in verse
[28:44] seven and he begins talking about how
[28:46] the Holy Ghost fell on the Gentiles and
[28:49] he says in verse seven and when there
[28:51] had been much disputing Peter rose up
[28:53] and said there men and brethren you know
[28:54] how that a good while ago God made
[28:56] choice among us that the Gentiles by my
[28:59] mouth should hear the word of the gospel
[29:01] and believed in other words God chose me
[29:03] Jesus gave me the keys to the kingdom
[29:06] first thing and God said and God which
[29:09] knoweth the hearts bear them witness
[29:11] giving them the Holy Ghost even as he
[29:14] did unto us remember Paul says the
[29:18] Gentiles in Cornelius house they acted
[29:21] the same way we acted when we got the
[29:23] Holy Ghost it wasn't a different way it
[29:26] was the same way praise God Peter said I
[29:29] know how they acted I know how they
[29:31] looked the same way the Holy Ghost fell
[29:33] on them is the same way it fell on us in
[29:35] Acts chapter 2 praise God amen now he
[29:39] says in verse I here's what I want to
[29:41] get to 9 and put no difference between
[29:43] us and then purifying their hearts by
[29:47] faith so see when someone gets the Holy
[29:50] Ghost God is purifying their heart he's
[29:53] sealing their their heart saying this
[29:55] heart wants to be pure I'm gonna keep
[29:57] them pure he's sealing in God's Christ's
[30:02] righteousness and he's sealing out the
[30:04] defilement of the world go to acts 5:32
[30:08] oh this is glorious matter oh thank you
[30:11] Jesus
[30:11] ah why is it glorious Bo just cuz I see
[30:18] God purifying my heart praise God the
[30:22] same gospel not a different gospel not
[30:25] as denominations interpretation but the
[30:27] same gospel purifying my heart to make
[30:30] me love Christ more verse 32 Peter says
[30:34] this is Peter again and we are witnesses
[30:38] of these things also and so also is the
[30:40] Holy Ghost who God hath given to them
[30:43] that obey him see God waits until
[30:46] somebody is really gonna obey they
[30:49] really want to be pure God I just want
[30:51] my heart to be pure
[30:52] and they'll say okay I'll bet and this
[30:54] for me it was I know baby would get rid
[30:55] of the cigarettes obey get rid of the
[30:57] movies and the cussing in the sports and
[30:59] it just get totally sanctified for a
[31:01] couple of years gotta to keep getting me
[31:03] to obey and purify and finally God
[31:06] poured out his Holy Spirit upon me
[31:08] praise God and I see the effects of it
[31:10] it's guiding me more into the truth of
[31:13] God's Word not guiding me away to man's
[31:15] opinions but back to the book of Acts
[31:17] but back to the letters of Paul
[31:19] back to the holy scripture that we know
[31:21] was inspired by the Holy Spirit amen
[31:24] thank the Lord hallelujah thank the Lord
[31:31] Frey's that's why people don't get born
[31:33] again they don't want to be more pure
[31:34] and they don't want to obey God's Word
[31:38] when I preach on that I remember
[31:40] Beatrice has had a spell at one
[31:42] Wednesday night I was preaching on
[31:43] showing all the ways about the Holy
[31:45] Ghost why the foolish virgin don't get
[31:47] the Holy Ghost they don't want to be
[31:48] more pure they don't want to obey all
[31:50] the Word of God Ray was here and sister
[31:52] Beatrice had a spell and was screaming
[31:54] and shouting all around there last
[31:55] summer I know if you remember that but I
[31:56] remember that was the the Holy Spirit
[31:59] took me off my notes and took me that
[32:00] direction and God spear got poured out
[32:03] right here amen on a Wednesday night
[32:04] praise God amen hallelujah cuz it's
[32:08] God's Word amen and he's searching he's
[32:10] sick he's searching for true worshipers
[32:12] that'll worship in spirit and in truth
[32:14] amen glory okay so yeah that those just
[32:21] two scriptures just came to my heart now
[32:22] I just want to share those there that's
[32:24] who got so these Gentiles had the same
[32:27] heart they wanted pure hearts and they
[32:29] were willing to obey all the word of
[32:30] Jesus
[32:31] so Jesus gave him the Holy Ghost John
[32:34] says hey there's someone coming after
[32:36] way bigger than me and he's the one i
[32:38] baptize with water but he's gonna
[32:39] baptize with the Holy Ghost oh thank the
[32:43] Lord praise God now let me now
[32:48] transition now to our little church and
[32:50] brother branham's missionary work in
[32:53] this hour before we start getting into
[32:54] the the teaching on the book or the
[32:57] Philippian Church now I'm taking a lot
[33:00] of these quotes if you haven't listened
[33:01] to a good sermon in a while listen to
[33:03] taking sides with Jesus that is awesome
[33:05] we're listening to
[33:05] the way here so broadband takes it's
[33:07] like a ministers meeting there's only
[33:09] ministers there and he shows his vision
[33:14] for the future in other words how the
[33:16] church how the church with his message
[33:19] should expand their churches worldwide
[33:21] and they says we've got to take sides
[33:24] with the word we're taking sides with
[33:26] Jesus we're not taking sides with the
[33:27] world beautiful message beautiful and I
[33:30] may go back and I'm gonna just preach a
[33:31] little series on this because it's such
[33:34] a beautiful look it's a modern day look
[33:37] at how Paul would have operated today
[33:39] that's right so I'm thinking I'm jumping
[33:42] in you know to paragraph whoops sorry
[33:43] I'm jumping in paragraph 21 he says I'm
[33:46] very grateful
[33:46] I see it's got little he said time out
[33:49] his church is Jeffersonville Tabernacle
[33:51] I see it's got little satellites through
[33:53] that I'm grateful for
[33:55] brother Crais these are names of pastors
[33:58] in the area Sellersburg a crew back
[34:01] there brother Snelling is place and
[34:03] Utica brother run up there brother
[34:05] junior Jackson these precious boys find
[34:07] men wonderful men of God they preach
[34:09] this message so there was little
[34:11] churches all around Jeffersonville that
[34:13] started because of brother Rams ministry
[34:15] now some of these guys later went off in
[34:17] false doctrine I'm not I'm not gonna
[34:19] name them but it doesn't matter cuz we
[34:21] don't know him but they're I think
[34:22] they're all dead anyway but so brother
[34:26] Adam went when he's here 1962 this is
[34:28] before the seals were opened about nine
[34:30] months before the seals were open he
[34:32] said now we might disagree just a little
[34:35] wallop on something another that's only
[34:37] human amongst a group of ministers yet
[34:39] and if ministers had a little difference
[34:41] there won't be a shadow of difference in
[34:43] it like you know Simon and I we have
[34:44] different opinions on different
[34:45] scriptures brother Brooks and I we have
[34:47] some different opinions on scriptures
[34:49] brother Craig and I but we're all
[34:50] brothers praise God
[34:52] and so Bodrum saw this same thing his
[34:57] message was a new message it was like he
[35:00] was another Apostle Paul and he went
[35:03] seven times around the world not by boat
[35:05] but by airplane
[35:06] and he sacrificed a lot of time from his
[35:08] family but he saw there his message was
[35:13] a unique message
[35:14] it was fresh from the Word of God
[35:17] and he says but our church has little
[35:20] satellites now really Church in all
[35:24] reality our church is just a satellite a
[35:27] brother Brooks's Church now brother
[35:30] Brooks's Church which is a satellite out
[35:32] of the church down there in South
[35:34] Carolina because he got saved in South
[35:35] Carolina
[35:36] now it's strange because when pastors
[35:38] moved then like our you know our
[35:39] satellite moves you know so but so you
[35:43] know from Jeffersonville brother brother
[35:45] branham and then there's a brother from
[35:47] South Carolina I think brother Johnson
[35:49] was named brother Brooks got saved there
[35:51] in South Carolina where Brooks moves up
[35:53] to Lyman a pastor for about 20 years in
[35:55] that time we get saying praise God and
[35:57] then we come out of brother Brooks's
[36:00] ministry and so we're just a satellite
[36:03] out of that church and we all preach
[36:08] this message we don't all agree on
[36:10] everything but we're all brothers praise
[36:13] God and so God is doing the same thing
[36:16] today that he did in the early church
[36:19] there now next quote one of these
[36:24] brothers might say I believe the money
[36:25] will come Jesus be on the white horse
[36:27] others say well I believe when he comes
[36:29] to be on a white cloud well as long as
[36:32] they believe he's come and that's the
[36:33] main thing no matter how he's coming now
[36:38] there's a balance of this too because
[36:40] remember Paul said there was two
[36:41] preachers that said the rapture has
[36:44] already happened and Paul said that was
[36:45] cankering in the church so that we have
[36:48] to have a good balance on this too as
[36:49] long as we believe the rapture is coming
[36:51] that's the main thing but if someone
[36:53] says the rapture is past or you have to
[36:55] do these certain things like worship
[36:57] everywhere program says to go in the
[36:59] rapture now that's wrong there so yeah
[37:00] be careful how we balance this two as
[37:02] well but see but Rose is trying to say
[37:05] that we're all brothers that we need to
[37:06] be brothers as long as we stay right in
[37:09] our doctrine because he goes in that
[37:10] later now we're going to start off with
[37:14] the early church just about five minutes
[37:16] now and then I can show you the vision
[37:19] that I have for the future so again if
[37:22] you want listen a good sermon this is a
[37:23] great sermon to see how brother and
[37:25] thought the Holy Ghost would use him and
[37:28] brother Neville and the brother
[37:30] to spread the gospel around the world
[37:34] now talks about when the Holy Ghost fell
[37:36] he said someone had to take Judas's
[37:38] place it was matthias took Judas's place
[37:41] so he talks about people having to take
[37:42] he says if I died brother Neville died
[37:45] someone asked to take her place so he
[37:46] said we have to leave footprints on the
[37:48] sands of time now some of these quotes
[37:50] I'm skipping because I just want to get
[37:52] to the main ones I want to share today
[37:54] now I would suggest suggest this I did
[37:57] the brother Neville let's carry on it
[37:58] just as we have let's just let's start
[38:02] it just the way it is look he brings up
[38:06] the young ministers that are preachers
[38:07] not take players preachers I'm grateful
[38:10] for these young ministers see actually
[38:12] have the damned judgment this entire
[38:15] valleys down through there Jefferson
[38:17] bill there will be no excuse because
[38:19] we've got little churches setting out
[38:21] everywhere outposts listening posts
[38:23] waiting praise God look it's a big
[38:26] church for the Jose he said little
[38:28] churches amen
[38:30] see a little charge is a major witness
[38:34] on the day of judgment praise God we
[38:37] might be small in man's eyes but we're
[38:39] big in God's eyes amen because we will
[38:42] be a witness on the damned judgement
[38:45] praise God that we lived it even though
[38:47] you know we had we were smaller had a
[38:49] little limitations or things like that
[38:51] it didn't matter
[38:52] we believed God's Word and we're
[38:54] witnesses against anyone who won't
[38:56] believe it because we know it's right
[38:58] and we know Jesus Christ is alive today
[39:00] praise God and we're preaching the
[39:03] original gospel like I said I might not
[39:05] be able to bring it all the pass you can
[39:07] only bring to pass what you're gifted to
[39:08] do and what God's called you to do but
[39:11] we got to be willing to grow into all
[39:12] God is a has force we can't stop short
[39:15] we got to press on and into the mark of
[39:17] the high calling in Christ Jesus amen
[39:20] praise God he said last night I was at a
[39:25] brother's Church in Jefferson girl
[39:26] somewhere and I asked if are all their
[39:29] fortified behind the word and every hand
[39:31] went up that made me feel good so he
[39:34] would visit local churches that preach
[39:35] his message his his teachings and he
[39:39] said how many four to five year how many
[39:41] leave here you're protected behind God's
[39:43] Word and
[39:43] hanwen up he said that makes me feel
[39:45] good praise God it makes me feel good to
[39:49] see you guys keep coming back to church
[39:50] every Sunday to bang you nice we would
[39:53] be we've been together since the
[39:54] beginning buddy I know you're fortified
[39:56] behind God's Word because remember part
[39:59] of being part of being in a local church
[40:02] proves that you're a real believer
[40:04] because go to let's go back to 1st John
[40:06] real quick remember they went out from
[40:08] us because they were not of us so one of
[40:11] the proofs that you are born again and
[40:12] that you are saying is that you can sit
[40:15] in a local church and sit and be taught
[40:17] God's Word
[40:19] that's why brother BAM said these little
[40:21] churches you'll be witnesses on the day
[40:24] of judgment praise God that you believed
[40:26] it a man now I didn't plan on preaching
[40:31] this some it'll just look and see if I
[40:33] can find it if anybody finds it just
[40:35] speak it out there they went out from us
[40:39] cuz they're not of us I know I got an
[40:41] inner highlight it oh there it is yeah
[40:44] 3 or 2 to 18 and 19 yeah so see there's
[40:50] an aspect of this if you're born again
[40:53] you will stay with the preacher that you
[40:56] heard the gospel from until God you said
[40:58] until God would send you to another one
[41:00] praise God right you stay with them
[41:03] because you know the Word of God came to
[41:06] you through that individual praise God
[41:08] that's why I sat on her brother Brooks
[41:10] that's why when when I when we we lived
[41:14] here right vague for a year and a half
[41:17] we drove three hours like Wendy's doing
[41:18] now she's done it for numerous years but
[41:20] she drove wheelie drove three hours we
[41:22] jam in our cars
[41:23] I'll pack in there we drove three hours
[41:26] one way just to go to brother Brooks's
[41:29] church because we had confidence him we
[41:31] know God spoke to us through that man so
[41:35] we supported that man praise God
[41:38] and then you know we got to the spot
[41:41] some of the amen
[41:42] where bang and John Lisa and a lady and
[41:46] Kerry and I met and you know and my
[41:48] wife's gonna have Malachi and we're like
[41:49] this is gonna be hard to travel with all
[41:51] these and so the idea came up should we
[41:53] start a church so let's pray and fast we
[41:55] prayed fasted about it
[41:57] talk to brother Brooks we started a
[41:58] church and the reason was because we and
[42:02] I remember specifically talking about
[42:04] this with John Lisa and lady and Carrie
[42:05] they said we loved the message and we
[42:09] believe God's going to save our family
[42:10] so we want a church an Akron so that
[42:13] when our because it's our family lives
[42:14] around Akron they can have a church so
[42:17] that when our family gets saved they'll
[42:19] have a church that's real close to them
[42:20] praise God and look what we got right
[42:23] here thank you God Amen praise God
[42:26] that's the whole desire was that we
[42:29] didn't just make such a sacrifice
[42:30] because we know the same God in Lima is
[42:33] the same God in Akron praise God
[42:35] God is not a respecter of persons one
[42:38] thing he respects is his Lord Amen
[42:40] praise God and so that's the whole point
[42:47] of purpose of these churches springing
[42:49] out we're a satellite out of brother
[42:51] Brooks which was satellite out of
[42:53] Jeffersonville now when it was right
[42:54] when Jeffersonville was right under
[42:56] brother Branham and brother Neville but
[42:59] see we're just like little shoots you
[43:01] know stars shooting stars maybe was say
[43:07] first John 2:18 little children is the
[43:09] last time not that was the last time
[43:11] then what is it now
[43:12] see they all believed it was the end
[43:14] time it was the last time and he have
[43:18] heard that Antichrist shall come even
[43:20] now are there men the Antichrist
[43:22] so it's John's like we know there's
[43:24] going to come one Antichrist we know
[43:25] it's the Pope but there's many right now
[43:27] that spirits moving already
[43:28] this was 80 after eighty ninety whereby
[43:32] we know that it is the last time they
[43:36] went out from us but they were not of us
[43:39] see church many times those who have the
[43:41] Antichrist spirit will leave our church
[43:42] and other churches right other churches
[43:45] that believe that the truth for if they
[43:49] had been of us they would no doubt have
[43:53] continued with us but they went out and
[43:57] that they might be made manifest that
[43:59] they were not all of us so your ability
[44:02] to stay in a local church proves what
[44:04] you are it proves your sheep of God
[44:08] praise the Lord amen and
[44:11] you're a sheep and Jesus Christ is the
[44:13] Bishop of your soul praise God Eve the
[44:16] shepherd of your soul imagine somebody
[44:19] saying oh I believe Paul is a real man
[44:20] of God and Philip I we got leave the
[44:23] church and and then they're not even
[44:24] there to hear Paul's letter being read
[44:26] eleven years later
[44:27] where's his brother God did this for
[44:29] where is that brother you know we I've
[44:31] told you before but brother cam but and
[44:35] brother cam he credits me was starting
[44:38] their church cam credits me I was the
[44:41] one that he says I was the one that
[44:42] ordained that church to start so they
[44:44] are a satellite of our church and now
[44:46] they're way bigger than our church but
[44:48] see it don't matter the size it just
[44:49] matters the love of God now I think
[44:52] Cam's very gracious cam is very gracious
[44:54] but you know cam and Simon were coming
[44:56] to our church for a couple years and cam
[44:58] called me his pastor and then we felt
[45:00] led I said cam you really need to start
[45:02] pastor him brother he do an offense
[45:03] you're doing a great job they were doing
[45:04] Wednesday night Bible studies and I feel
[45:06] I feel you guys need to start a church
[45:08] so we per had prayer and fasting in
[45:10] Akron and then started that church and
[45:12] church they've had miracles I've told
[45:14] you some notable miracles at cam Church
[45:16] and yet some of those people have fallen
[45:18] away they don't come to church anymore
[45:19] I mean God has done great things
[45:22] miracles where I think I told you about
[45:25] one of the bows with the cane God healed
[45:28] him
[45:28] they don't come to church anymore
[45:29] different cares of the world come in and
[45:31] and then you know other things I see
[45:36] what I trust and they'll be saved but
[45:39] see the reality of it is if God has
[45:42] really pure fide your heart amen if you
[45:45] really want to obey every word of God
[45:46] you will stay with those that are
[45:48] feeding you the Word of God amen because
[45:52] you want it you can't get fed outside of
[45:54] the fivefold ministry that's God's Way
[45:56] to feet but Ramson the fivefold ministry
[45:58] is God's dress wear so God this is this
[46:01] is pastors teachers evangelists programs
[46:04] that God puts off that on and then he's
[46:06] amongst you praise God he's amongst me
[46:08] he's the heart see we've had we know but
[46:11] when we had the preachers lately who was
[46:13] it I shouldn't lightly my spent a lot of
[46:15] time so we had a guest preacher Simon
[46:17] and different ones like that they came
[46:18] and I felt like they were I came up for
[46:20] prayer because I felt they were
[46:21] preaching just to me praise God
[46:24] needed to hear certain things they were
[46:25] preaching brother and said the fivefold
[46:27] ministry is God's dress wear and God
[46:30] hides behind it all we can only hear the
[46:32] voice of God today praise God it's not
[46:35] me but it's the Word of God that's
[46:36] coming forward from this pulpit week
[46:38] after week month after month year after
[46:40] year it's God's Word it's God's message
[46:43] and we must be enthused about it praise
[46:45] God
[46:45] buh-bam says in fact he says a few
[46:48] moments so say we can never lose our
[46:50] enthusiasm for the Word of God
[46:52] see because then it just becomes common
[46:55] to us at what time am i okay I know I
[46:58] just have something I feel bad I know
[47:01] it's hard to sit there I know I talk
[47:02] sometimes I and I love everybody and I
[47:06] know you love me praise God but I want
[47:07] to be my mindful I don't wear you out
[47:10] some fill up easy myself you look long
[47:13] brother Brahim said I sometimes people
[47:15] get filled up now heat Moran says he
[47:19] make this church your headquarters now
[47:22] it wasn't like the people in
[47:24] Jeffersonville say today he said and
[47:26] brother Neville like your senior elder
[47:28] among you now Church Tim Humes I thought
[47:31] I talked to him I didn't I shouldn't
[47:33] talk to him and I heard his testimony as
[47:34] soon as brother Ram died they kicked
[47:37] brother Neville out of there he wasn't
[47:40] there very long they kicked him out
[47:41] because he wanted to preach and they
[47:42] just wanted to play tapes because that
[47:45] demon spirit of Antichrist was still
[47:47] there and still hung around they kicked
[47:51] him out in fact he would come to Tom and
[47:54] Marilyn Browns house brother bank and
[47:56] preach in their barn and garage till God
[47:59] started a church there Orman never would
[48:01] but this is how much God brought her
[48:04] brother man thought a brother Armand
[48:05] Neville make him your senior elder now
[48:08] looked just
[48:09] he died in 65 four years later we don't
[48:12] need this guy but look how brother
[48:15] Graham was that he was establishing it
[48:16] by apostolic order praise God find a
[48:20] leader who's experienced that loves us
[48:22] faithful to the Word of God and he said
[48:25] all you brothers like brother Neville he
[48:27] said and sometimes you got a question
[48:29] come out discuss with your church here
[48:30] and I remember he's talking to ministers
[48:31] then bring it to brother Neville you all
[48:34] discuss it together if you can't come in
[48:35] any question I'll be coming by pretty
[48:36] soon
[48:37] all come together with it now in the
[48:40] years past when I've had questions I've
[48:41] always gone to brother Brooks but as
[48:43] time is going on I haven't need to go as
[48:45] much it's kind of like it's just kinda
[48:48] like growing up it's kind like when you
[48:51] start a new class you got to talk to the
[48:53] teacher but after a while okay I got it
[48:56] you know in other words now I cannot
[48:58] rely upon the Holy Spirit but but
[49:01] brother Brian was telling them ministers
[49:04] need to get together in fellowship now
[49:06] we did that brother banging you might
[49:07] remember we had ministers meeting we had
[49:08] six ministers meetings with brother
[49:10] Brooks and brother Craig so I brought
[49:11] brother cam and brother Vince we had all
[49:13] these brothers there but the Paula
[49:15] Fontaine came to one so we have six or
[49:19] set and I was one that started that
[49:20] years ago but after Craig left
[49:23] I haven't felt any connection there
[49:25] because I don't know those brothers very
[49:27] well so why haven't we haven't had
[49:28] ministers meetings for a number of years
[49:30] but also meet with Simon and cam from
[49:32] time to time maybe once a year and just
[49:34] just we'll just call it a minister's
[49:35] meeting we'll just talk about the things
[49:36] of God it's harder when you don't like
[49:39] when you have a relationship with
[49:41] someone it's hard to go there and talk
[49:42] about doctrine because you don't really
[49:44] I you can't trust them you know all the
[49:46] way cuz you don't know them and so I'm
[49:48] just kind of waiting for God to renew
[49:50] that perhaps so Brown says you got to
[49:54] get together and come together and solve
[49:55] these if there's any problems he said
[49:58] then in there get training in your own
[50:00] groups other ministers men that you see
[50:02] as a calling in their life for the
[50:04] ministry train them young men bring them
[50:07] up to to the elder all of you set the
[50:10] ministerial meeting and their teeth the
[50:11] deep or teach the deeper things of God
[50:14] praise God and that beautiful boat Ram
[50:17] said if you've got if you're a pastor
[50:18] look for faithful brothers that'll be
[50:20] preachers and teach them the Word of God
[50:22] and then have ministerial meetings and
[50:25] train them up we had in 2015 and 16 we
[50:29] had three ministers meetings because I
[50:31] had four brothers that were thought they
[50:33] were preachers in our church and within
[50:35] one year we had no more because they all
[50:37] left and I'll tell you this one of them
[50:39] I've said questions on I said God if you
[50:42] want if you want this person to preach
[50:44] at our church anymore I said let them
[50:47] stay but if not send them away and
[50:49] within a month
[50:50] God sent that person
[50:52] see cuz I put it up to God in prayer but
[50:56] when I when I saw our church growing
[50:57] like that by a minute was right when you
[50:58] came in when we start went over there
[51:00] and I saw had four ministers on the
[51:02] oklets that ministers meeting because I
[51:03] knew this quote I want to train them up
[51:05] in what I believe but we only had three
[51:06] and pretty soon most of all they're all
[51:09] gone now
[51:09] and I don't want to name names but I'm
[51:12] trying to show you that I believe in the
[51:14] Apostolic teaching I believe in that and
[51:18] God has a time and season for and we're
[51:21] not supposed to stay on simple things
[51:22] we're to go to deeper things of God the
[51:25] mysteries of God praise the Lord but
[51:27] could be any deeper than a mystery of
[51:28] God now I want to find a scripture real
[51:34] quick where Paul said commit them to
[51:36] faithful other men a little you might be
[51:39] able to find it before me faithful men I
[51:43] think it's commit these things to
[51:45] faithful men I know Paul said it I think
[51:47] it's in Timothy there it is yep go to
[51:49] second Timothy 2 verse 2 second Timothy
[51:52] 2:2 so see you have to be part of a
[51:53] local church that's apostolic most of us
[51:56] know that pretty well but I want to
[51:57] remind you of that the reason people
[51:59] leave many times is because they're
[52:00] Antichrist and how do you know they're
[52:03] against the word when I show them
[52:04] something in the word or you show
[52:05] something in the word they disagree well
[52:08] if it's a major issue that's Antichrist
[52:09] if it's minor it's okay we just have
[52:11] differences we still love when we love
[52:13] everybody even if they got a Anti Christ
[52:14] fear we're supposed to love our enemy
[52:16] sprays God
[52:17] second Timothy 2:2 now let's go to verse
[52:22] 1 because this is Paul's last letter
[52:24] before he dies he gets his head chopped
[52:26] off for the gospel praise God he said
[52:28] thou therefore my son be strong in the
[52:31] grace that is in Christ Jesus and these
[52:33] things as I was heard of me among many
[52:35] witnesses the same commit thou to
[52:37] faithful men who shall be able to teach
[52:40] others also
[52:42] but the hos age of something struck me
[52:43] right now he said these things that
[52:47] you've heard among many witnesses now
[52:49] for the Jose you didn't know I didn't
[52:51] talk about this but what a bro Graham's
[52:52] son talks about the shark swimming out
[52:54] there was that was that spoken among
[52:58] many witnesses no so people see anyone
[53:02] who have ever had any interaction with
[53:04] brother Branham
[53:05] any little thing he said they make it
[53:07] like this thus saith the Lord but Paul
[53:10] said not everything I said amen but the
[53:13] things that I said amongst many witness
[53:15] in other words the things I said behind
[53:17] the pulpit preaching God's Word amen
[53:20] those things commit to faithful men
[53:22] because they'll teach others the same
[53:24] praise God and now you have people
[53:27] around the world wondering his brother
[53:30] I'm a proper not because look his sons
[53:33] saying this and this and that it hasn't
[53:35] come to pass because they're sharing
[53:37] things that were not thus saith the Lord
[53:39] they're not on tape and they weren't
[53:40] spoken in many witnesses now like this
[53:43] verse 3 I heard Donny Reagan say
[53:46] something verse 3 thou therefore endure
[53:49] hardness as a good shoulder or shoulder
[53:53] or soldier rather of Christ now look at
[53:55] Donny Reagan said brother bang he said
[53:56] he said Paul didn't say become hard
[53:59] he said endure hardness right like we
[54:02] could all get a hard heart
[54:04] I've had people rip my character and say
[54:06] evil things and lie on me but I got to
[54:09] have a soft heart
[54:10] he didn't say become hard he said endure
[54:13] hardness praise God keep your heart soft
[54:16] love your enemies do good to those who
[54:19] persecute you bless those who persecute
[54:21] you rejoice in that day because you know
[54:25] you've got treasures in heaven glory
[54:28] don't become hard but endure hardness oh
[54:33] thank the Lord I love the things of God
[54:35] amen
[54:36] keep somebody Cisse tells these
[54:39] ministers keep somebody who can have
[54:41] confidence and like like a leader for
[54:43] you now not a bishop not like an
[54:45] official leader but just someone a
[54:46] mentor you look up to who can I go to
[54:49] and I've got questions I've got a pastor
[54:51] right now but the Amen he calls me every
[54:52] about every four or five months he's got
[54:54] a doctrinal question he's older than me
[54:57] but I've been pastor longer than him and
[54:58] so he really likes my teaching videos
[55:00] he'll call me and ask me doctrinal
[55:02] questions before he makes a decision and
[55:04] I don't ask him to do that but he kind
[55:06] of looks to me like a leader he's told
[55:08] me that he said he said you're Easton
[55:10] you're kind of like my pastor now he's
[55:11] I'm not because that's Antichrist but
[55:15] sometimes you need someone sometimes you
[55:17] need a mentor some
[55:19] to reach out to people that's a policy
[55:20] teach others the Word of God that things
[55:23] I preach that they can teach others the
[55:26] same thing and endure hardness be a good
[55:29] soldier of Jesus Christ it's going to be
[55:32] hard preaching preach is not an easy
[55:33] thing
[55:34] preaching is a hard thing right you have
[55:36] hardness you have you probably seen it
[55:39] maybe not but from the pulpit I see
[55:41] people's faces all the time and some of
[55:43] them are really hard against me thanks
[55:45] God
[55:45] some of them will shake their heads and
[55:47] walk out and other people leave you know
[55:50] don't like to hear it or rebuke me after
[55:52] service you know I can tell whether
[55:54] little they're liking it right away or
[55:56] not you just got a preacher the hardness
[55:58] praise God and endure it because you got
[56:01] to be a good soldier for Christ and if
[56:08] you don't brother and if you don't see
[56:09] it exactly the way the other preacher
[56:10] does that's all right
[56:11] you're in the faith just move along
[56:12] maybe when we come together all of us
[56:14] will pray the discernment of God will
[56:16] come down and he'll give it just exactly
[56:18] the way it is let us know how to do it
[56:21] and in their churches can go here and
[56:23] training up a group of men and if I'm an
[56:26] evangelistic works somewhere there's
[56:28] places I can place them worldwide so
[56:31] this was wrote as vision I want to train
[56:33] up preachers her brother Neville needs
[56:35] to train up preachers so that when when
[56:37] brother Adam goes on missionary trips he
[56:39] can leave there but then send a faithful
[56:42] pastor to Pastor them that was brother
[56:45] brems vision and so I'm gonna share this
[56:48] with brother Simon too if he maybe he he
[56:50] probably knows it but I'm gonna share
[56:51] with him anyway just so like when he
[56:53] sees people being saved in Thailand we
[56:56] got to pray that God will raise up some
[56:57] pastor there and we prayed for that
[56:58] member we pray for that but if God don't
[57:00] raise one up maybe someone's willing to
[57:02] go and be a pastor and endure hardness
[57:05] and preach and try to save you some
[57:06] little lambs in Thailand let me try to
[57:10] find it because he talks about India he
[57:13] said there was thousands of people saved
[57:14] he said they come out of heathenism then
[57:20] they don't have anybody once he leaves
[57:21] they don't have anybody to teach him
[57:22] God's Word all right now
[57:27] real quick Titus chapter 1 real quick
[57:28] here I'm just kind of I feel like this
[57:30] was more of like a Apostolic sermon
[57:32] today but it's it's absolutely necessary
[57:35] so that you know you and I know how our
[57:39] church is a part of the bigger picture
[57:42] our church is a part of the book of Acts
[57:45] Church we're spreading the same word the
[57:47] same gospel and we got to be constantly
[57:49] enthused and trying to invite people to
[57:51] hear the word of God and spread the word
[57:53] any way we can praise God because that's
[57:56] how God does it now Titus was a Greek he
[57:59] was a full-blooded Greek and member the
[58:03] disciples tried or I'm sorry these false
[58:04] brethren Jews tried to get him to be
[58:06] circumcised and Paul said we wouldn't
[58:07] even listen for one hour we were we
[58:09] wouldn't give them a space for one hour
[58:11] all this these these Jews were trying to
[58:14] to get him back in bondage again and
[58:17] Paul said no they're just trying to make
[58:18] us slaves back to the their in other
[58:20] words they're false Church so Titus
[58:23] wasn't circumcised and and and and these
[58:26] guys were saying he needs to be
[58:27] circumcised and Paul said leave it alone
[58:29] but then the opposite side Paul goes
[58:32] with Timothy amongst Jews and Paul
[58:36] circumcised as Timothy so that the Jews
[58:38] will sit up with him so there has to be
[58:40] a balance there has to be a time to do
[58:42] it you have to ask me a reason to do
[58:44] something like that
[58:46] that's quite a thing they're quite a
[58:48] kind of thing these people were serious
[58:52] in other words Timothy was ready to have
[58:54] a surgery just so somebody could hear
[58:56] the word of God right have a surgery for
[59:00] just for the someone could hear the word
[59:01] of God now there it is verse 5 I she
[59:08] let's go to verse 4 to Titus my own son
[59:11] after the common faith grace mercy and
[59:13] peace from God the Father and the Lord
[59:15] Jesus Christ our Savior look how he
[59:18] dressed the guy that he saved here he
[59:20] said you're my son right now we don't do
[59:23] the Holy Father thing like that but I
[59:25] kind of look to brother Brooks is like a
[59:26] spiritual father I look to brother Craig
[59:28] is a spiritual father they taught me the
[59:30] Word of God my own son after
[59:34] common faith grace mercy peace ok verse
[59:36] 5 for this cause left ID and Crete that
[59:38] thou should have set in order the things
[59:40] that are wanting and ordain elders in
[59:43] every city as I had appointed thee so
[59:47] Paul says I'm gonna pass on later on I'm
[59:49] gonna go I may go to the grave but Titus
[59:51] you're you're a pastor and you need to
[59:54] ordain pastors in all these different
[59:56] cities so I've done one I've done
[59:58] brother Kim where the Kam's the only one
[59:59] a only pastor I've ordained in another
[1:00:01] city and so see brother Brooks ordained
[1:00:05] me here to be a pastor here under the
[1:00:07] leadership of the Holy Spirit I've tried
[1:00:09] to be faithful that calling by God's
[1:00:10] grace so see this is the Apostolic
[1:00:14] fashion now let me try to find a place
[1:00:17] to close before we get into this book
[1:00:20] it's just a beautiful book yeah so
[1:00:23] buh-bam says right here what if I had
[1:00:24] young men training the message they said
[1:00:27] before I leave here like India we're
[1:00:29] going to set in order these churches I
[1:00:31] love a man I've already tell grand them
[1:00:33] they got the money they're on their road
[1:00:35] right now to take over this a good man
[1:00:40] he said there's two or three assists
[1:00:42] young men with them who will be helpers
[1:00:44] and assistants that's what we need to
[1:00:45] pray for by the Simon that God will help
[1:00:47] him to win some souls and then somebody
[1:00:49] can go over there and just stay there
[1:00:50] and train them up for the kingdom of God
[1:00:52] because Jesus said the end will not come
[1:00:54] until the gospel has been preached to
[1:00:56] every nation someone has to do it praise
[1:00:58] God someone has to do it
[1:01:02] okay now you talked about posting them
[1:01:05] all over the world now I'm not going to
[1:01:08] get to all these but brother Branham
[1:01:09] says keep carrying on he's got to stay
[1:01:12] enthused about the message gotta have a
[1:01:13] purpose a target and off to answer for a
[1:01:17] church he said all the preachers have to
[1:01:18] answer for the church I have to answer
[1:01:19] did I keep God's Word or not and then
[1:01:22] brother Branham was he was he was
[1:01:23] directing his whole life after that
[1:01:25] vision to go up and store up food okay
[1:01:27] let's close here let's just go back to
[1:01:31] acts 16 let's close with that by God's
[1:01:33] grace acts 16
[1:01:44] let's see how the church started here in
[1:01:46] Phillipi you're probably familiar with
[1:01:50] it verse 14 remember the aim or the the
[1:01:53] vision said come down here come preach
[1:01:55] to us so verse 14 and a certain woman
[1:01:59] named Lydia a seller of purple of the
[1:02:01] city of Thyatira which worshipped God
[1:02:03] heard us whose heart the Lord opened and
[1:02:07] that she attended under the things which
[1:02:09] were spoken of Paul remember where do
[1:02:13] they find Lydia they found her verse 13
[1:02:15] on the Sabbath they're on a Riverside
[1:02:17] prayer was wont to be made and we sat
[1:02:20] down to see never stop your prayer life
[1:02:24] for it never stopped your public
[1:02:25] services right
[1:02:27] one of these days somebody's gonna warn
[1:02:29] her in here someone else is gonna get
[1:02:31] saved praise God if the Lord is willing
[1:02:33] we believe that so see someone they just
[1:02:38] were having prayer and then Lydia God
[1:02:40] opened her heart to God's Word and so
[1:02:44] see when got when someone when God opens
[1:02:45] someone's heart to open their house as
[1:02:47] well let me say like this now open the
[1:02:50] checkbook to support the church with
[1:02:51] tithes and offerings when God opens up
[1:02:54] someone's heart the rest of their life
[1:02:56] will become open to what God is doing
[1:02:58] there
[1:02:58] praise God this is what God was doing
[1:03:01] you know it reminded me brother bang of
[1:03:03] when I was at Akron University and I
[1:03:07] remember I still remember it very
[1:03:08] vividly there was I was in a computer
[1:03:10] lab and I was typing up the water
[1:03:12] baptism and I was doing clipart brother
[1:03:15] van pictures of Jesus from the internet
[1:03:17] and copying and pasting them
[1:03:19] I had these Bible studies and d'von sat
[1:03:21] on this side of me I'm saying I'm
[1:03:24] showing how God did a ministry work in
[1:03:27] Akron and he looks over and said what
[1:03:30] clipart is that I said that's Jesus on
[1:03:32] the cross and I another one of baptism
[1:03:34] just you know it's a cartoon of a man
[1:03:36] baptizing a believer he said well he
[1:03:38] said what is that he said I said that's
[1:03:40] baptism have you ever been baptized
[1:03:42] no I said you were in baptized the name
[1:03:45] of Lord Jesus you know it's an Lord
[1:03:47] Jesus Christ's baptism and his name
[1:03:48] Divine's like no I'm like hey man you
[1:03:50] need to come to my Bible study
[1:03:52] and the rest is history various God I'm
[1:03:55] just going back I just went to my house
[1:03:57] at my post of duty I'm just studying the
[1:03:59] scriptures I'm trying to win souls and
[1:04:01] God send somebody directly right next to
[1:04:04] me that will bring somebody else who
[1:04:05] believes God's Word just going about the
[1:04:09] regular duty
[1:04:10] some people said I should have quit
[1:04:11] college I'm glad I did it brother bang
[1:04:14] praise God
[1:04:15] I'm glad I didn't there's John Graham
[1:04:17] and Lisa Graham I'm gladiator I'm not
[1:04:20] sure where she's at by note carries
[1:04:22] still serving the Lord so you just go
[1:04:24] over and about the regular post of duty
[1:04:27] and God will start sending people to the
[1:04:29] here the Word of God
[1:04:31] praise God now these people had some
[1:04:33] great miracles but we don't know all the
[1:04:34] great miracles right with Lydia her
[1:04:38] heart just opens to what Paul's saying
[1:04:41] we're not told of any miracles
[1:04:43] because remember God don't have to do an
[1:04:46] outward miracle of a healing God's got
[1:04:48] to do an inward miracle praise God of a
[1:04:51] soul that's tired of trying to earn
[1:04:53] salvation but a soul that will want to
[1:04:56] find rest in the bosom of Christ amen
[1:05:00] and so that's what Lydia wanted Linda
[1:05:03] wanted to find rest for her soul so God
[1:05:05] opened her heart to hear the word of God
[1:05:07] and she received it verse 15 and when
[1:05:12] she was baptized and her household she
[1:05:15] besought us saying if ye have judged me
[1:05:17] to be faithful to the Lord come into my
[1:05:19] house and abide there and she
[1:05:21] constrained us but praise God verse 16
[1:05:25] and it came to pass as we went to prayer
[1:05:26] certain dance damsel possessed with a
[1:05:29] spirit of divination met us which
[1:05:30] brought her master's much game by sue
[1:05:33] saying the same followed Paul and us and
[1:05:36] cried saying these men are the servants
[1:05:38] of the Most High God which show unto us
[1:05:40] the way of salvation and this did she
[1:05:43] many days but Paul being grieved turned
[1:05:45] and said to the spirit I command thee in
[1:05:48] the name of Jesus Christ to come out of
[1:05:50] her and he and he came out the same hour
[1:05:53] let's stand to our feet praise God isn't
[1:05:57] that encouraging church they just
[1:05:59] started praying publicly in other words
[1:06:01] they had public church service God saved
[1:06:04] one and they just kept going to pray
[1:06:06] and on the way this woman keeps
[1:06:07] harassing them and pretty soon he calls
[1:06:09] out and reduced that spirit in the name
[1:06:11] of Jesus Christ now pretty soon to cause
[1:06:13] such a uproar they kicked this guy out
[1:06:15] of town they don't want any more to do
[1:06:17] with him
[1:06:17] because he was driving spirits out and
[1:06:20] they got real mad about it
[1:06:22] but see this is how the church started
[1:06:26] and I'll say like this I've never seen
[1:06:28] fire over anyone's forehead I wish I
[1:06:30] would
[1:06:31] I've never seen the pillar of fire I've
[1:06:34] never seen a jail have an earthquake and
[1:06:36] people come out but Jesus Christ himself
[1:06:39] said blessed are those who believe yet
[1:06:42] haven't seen thank God amen I don't know
[1:06:45] if Lidia even saw a miracle but one
[1:06:47] miracle that happened was her heart
[1:06:49] wanted to be right with God Almighty
[1:06:51] praise God amen
[1:06:53] and God honored her brother Vega as the
[1:06:56] first convert in all of Europe this
[1:07:00] cellar was just a little woman who sold
[1:07:03] purple now they said she made a lot of
[1:07:05] money she probably helps support the
[1:07:06] church for years to come that's why she
[1:07:08] probably that business her business
[1:07:10] probably paid for the pastor after Paul
[1:07:12] left her business ties and offerings
[1:07:14] probably paid for that pastor to live
[1:07:15] because that was a very lucrative
[1:07:17] business and they just lived as long as
[1:07:20] they could miss their musicians if
[1:07:21] you'll come but amen let me know if you
[1:07:23] got a song on your heart buddy and sure
[1:07:24] and let me know if you got a song on
[1:07:25] your heart you like to sing here now
[1:07:30] this is more like of a teaching but just
[1:07:32] to kind of see here I hope you're
[1:07:35] blessed by the Word of God today I think
[1:07:38] as as we look if we really want to rest
[1:07:41] on what Paul preached we've got to know
[1:07:43] what Paul said and seeing how Paul
[1:07:47] started these little churches is so
[1:07:48] encouraging because it's the same thing
[1:07:50] repeating today just different vessels
[1:07:52] and then you'll see some of the problems
[1:07:55] they had like we saw the problems in
[1:07:57] Galatia legalism the problem in
[1:08:01] Ephesians you know well they don't have
[1:08:02] too many problems Paul's had to remind
[1:08:04] them to keep fighting the good fight of
[1:08:06] faith with the armor of God but you'll
[1:08:08] see some of the problems here in the
[1:08:09] Philippians church disunity people just
[1:08:12] not being friendly to each other
[1:08:14] yeah as you'll see Church God did all
[1:08:18] these miracles he casts out demons out
[1:08:20] of soothsayers he shook down the prison
[1:08:23] but yet eleven years later people are
[1:08:25] arguing about little things in the
[1:08:27] church and Paul's got to come in and say
[1:08:28] stop arguing stop worrying about stop
[1:08:33] bickering about this and this and that
[1:08:35] let's have the unity of the faith let's
[1:08:37] keep the gospel going let's let's save
[1:08:40] more Souls right let's major all the
[1:08:44] things that are major praise God the
[1:08:45] love of God the love of Jesus Christ
[1:08:49] praise God let's bow our heads here
[1:08:53] we'll have just a general prayer and
[1:08:55] then I'm gonna bite brother bang to come
[1:08:56] up here if it's so we can pray and
[1:09:01] sister who if you want to come up later
[1:09:02] you can as well just whatever you're
[1:09:03] comfortable with you know if you want to
[1:09:06] stand in for your dad as well you both
[1:09:07] can stand in it's just up to you you
[1:09:09] know whatever you're comfortable let's
[1:09:11] just have a word of Prayer as we close
[1:09:13] the service here
[1:09:14] father in heaven we love you we thank
[1:09:16] you for your word this morning father
[1:09:20] it's just a blessing to see how you
[1:09:22] started this little church and Lorna as
[1:09:25] I saw in the video there's no record of
[1:09:26] that church anymore they have no grave
[1:09:32] that says here was Lydia the first
[1:09:34] camera there's no great so the church
[1:09:38] rose and then it found Lord your spirit
[1:09:40] moved on to where there was hungry souls
[1:09:42] but Lord we want to learn lessons from
[1:09:44] that dear God we want to see ourselves
[1:09:47] that's just a small little Philippian or
[1:09:49] Ephesian Church
[1:09:52] that believes the same thing Paul
[1:09:55] preached a lord that wants the livet
[1:09:59] that wants to be purified that wants to
[1:10:03] obey all of God's Word and wants to see
[1:10:08] this book of Acts continue through our
[1:10:10] lives we can trace our spiritual lineage
[1:10:13] Lord
[1:10:14] back to Jeffersonville back to the
[1:10:16] prophet of this hour and we're grateful
[1:10:21] we're thankful Lord God we want to keep
[1:10:24] firing shots Lord God we want to stay
[1:10:26] enthused keep us enthused about your
[1:10:28] word dear God and I pray you'd save some

[1:11:56] stomping and praising God he said your
[1:11:59] presence in the church gave our church

[1:12:08] dead wife he said after you guys left
