[16:43] requests here tonight we have a few
[16:44] announcements as well by the grace of
[16:46] the Lord let's start with announcements
[16:50] this Sunday will have brother Jim
[16:52] schumake preaching and I'll probably
[16:54] preach both services we have we're
[16:57] supposed to do the p.m. service on our
[17:00] outreach but I think I'll just push that
[17:01] off and till Wednesday or something like
[17:04] that I'll just preach it next Wednesday
[17:05] or something because I really would like
[17:07] to hear Jim twice you know if I can by
[17:10] the grace of the Lord so just so you
[17:12] know if we have a visitor praise the
[17:13] Lord they get to hear by the gym because
[17:15] the Holy Ghost can use whoever he wants
[17:16] to use they meant so just let you know
[17:19] that also August 6 Monday August 6 right
[17:22] now I think we have four people go into
[17:24] Jeffersonville right
[17:26] we have brother Aaron Jose myself and we
[17:30] have brother William that would like to
[17:31] go so oh bangs going but he's driving
[17:34] separately and he's gonna run a car and
[17:37] I'm gonna run another car cuz I my
[17:39] little car I don't think it can do by
[17:40] it's not as good as it used to be it's
[17:43] really slowed down I probably needs a
[17:45] tune-up or something like that I think
[17:46] I'll just rent a car so let's try to
[17:48] leave at 5 a.m. so we'll have to talk
[17:50] about that so everybody can get up at 4
[17:53] a.m. or we can maybe swing by and pick
[17:55] you up by there and you know on the way
[17:56] there we'll see so let's try to leave at
[18:01] 5 so we have to get up at 4 and because
[18:04] we got to be there by 12 so we can't be
[18:06] late for that we got to be right there
[18:07] at the Branum Tabernacle so sounds good
[18:13] let's talk about that amen also you
[18:18] probably saw it out there on the prayer
[18:20] request table
[18:22] limas having their annual Labor Day
[18:24] meeting so if you'd like to go of course
[18:26] you're welcome to go Jack Duff is a
[18:28] speaker Aaron McGarry and Jonathan
[18:31] Martin our preachers there so that's

[18:40] meetings that weekend's as far as with
[18:41] guest preachers so if people want to
[18:44] visit you know they're more than welcome
[18:45] to do that if they want to so there's
[18:47] there's two of them so I'll just put
[18:49] both of them out there actually on the
[18:50] prayer request table

[18:56] yeah I believe that's it we have two
[18:59] unspoken prayer requests tonight one of
[19:00] them deals with a marriage relationship
[19:03] another one deals with healing and I'm
[19:05] not gonna announce names because they're
[19:06] kind of personal but the one the
[19:09] marriage one contacted me this morning
[19:10] so let's pray for this unspoken marriage
[19:13] request and then there's unspoken
[19:15] healing that we need also pray for my
[19:19] wife she's not here she hasn't been

[33:30] Bibles tonight I'd like to preach out in
[33:33] Revelation chapter 5 again this will be
[33:34] part 2
[33:35] last week was part 1 just like to look
[33:38] at that thought so let's go to
[33:40] Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 the prophet
[33:47] called this the diamond hitch between
[33:50] the church ages and the seven seals the
[33:54] diamond hitch and I had to look that up
[33:55] what is a diamond hitch it's a tie it's
[33:58] something you when you're riding a horse
[34:00] it's something likes like a knot you do
[34:01] with the rope and it ties your saddlebag
[34:03] on to your saddle or something like that
[34:05] that's at least what Wikipedia said so
[34:09] chapter 5 is the diamond hitch or the
[34:12] tie between the church ages and the
[34:15] seven seals amen so interesting thought
[34:19] there Revelation chapter 5 please verse
[34:21] 1
[34:23] I have to read verse one and then we'll
[34:25] skip down to verse nine
[34:27] I'll read verse one and then we can all
[34:29] read verse nine together
[34:31] verse 1 oh just be me and I saw on the
[34:34] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[34:35] a book written within and on the
[34:37] backside sealed with seven seals let's
[34:42] read verse nine if we can on three one
[34:44] two three and they sung a new song
[34:47] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[34:51] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[34:54] wast slain and has redeemed us to God by
[34:59] thy blood out of every kindred and
[35:01] tongue and people and nation amen praise
[35:06] God let's have a word of Prayer let's
[35:07] just bow our heads unto our Lord here
[35:09] tonight father in heaven we thank you
[35:12] Lord for your mercy we thank you for
[35:14] your grace truly you have brought us out
[35:16] of the miry clay Lord you said in
[35:19] Ezekiel 16 that you found Israel
[35:21] lying in her own blood but then you
[35:24] pulled her out washed her off cleaned
[35:26] her up put on bracelets put on diamonds
[35:29] put a ring on her finger and she became
[35:32] your beautiful bride Lord if you do that
[35:35] visits more you did with the rod Lord
[35:37] who's not been blinded who would not
[35:39] reject the gospel would not reject the
[35:41] holy ghost' covenant but Lord your Bible
[35:45] says Lord that she's made herself ready
[35:47] she's washed in the blood of God's own
[35:50] son thank you Lord for these promises
[35:53] thank you Lord for making our robes pure
[35:55] and white like fine clean linen dear God
[35:59] thank you for what you've done for us Oh
[36:01] God help us that's happened to that
[36:03] thought tonight of this great Redeemer
[36:05] Lord God that we might be more thankful
[36:07] that we might rejoice and knowing what
[36:10] you've done here tonight Oh God
[36:12] we love you bless every heart and soul
[36:14] that pressed our way out to the house of
[36:15] God may you give them the bread of life
[36:17] tonight and father speak to us we pray O
[36:20] God in Jesus Christ's name and everybody
[36:22] said amen god bless you me Nancy the
[36:24] praise the Lord
[36:28] so we like to look
[36:30] nation chapter 5 here part 2 and you
[36:35] know remember last week when I was
[36:36] preaching on
[36:38] Revelation chapter 1 and remember how is
[36:40] preaching on Abba Father last week does
[36:42] anyone remember that well I got an email
[36:44] the next morning so last Thursday
[36:46] morning and this brother said oh praise
[36:48] the Lord
[36:48] he was live streaming us from down and I
[36:50] think it was Georgia or Alabama I'm not
[36:52] sure
[36:52] and he said praise the Lord he said you
[36:55] preach exactly what I heard or what I
[36:57] needed he said I thought I was past
[36:59] mercy and I and I thought I could not be
[37:03] forgiven he said for all that I've done
[37:05] in the past he was in jail and all the
[37:07] years telling me all this testimony you
[37:08] know things I pry shouldn't I should
[37:10] stop repeating it there but thank God he
[37:13] said I thought I was past forgiveness he
[37:16] said but then when you started preaching
[37:17] on how the Holy Spirit makes us groan
[37:19] for our Father he said he connected with
[37:22] that and he said that's why I groan for
[37:24] God is because I'm a part of God amen
[37:27] I was so fake I was wondering why I was
[37:29] preaching this because you know
[37:31] everybody seem kind of quiet during that
[37:32] time maybe I was quiet too but God knew
[37:35] that person that little old soul down
[37:37] there just
[37:46] you
[37:48] there's a groaning within us and we cry
[37:50] father we cry Abba we cry daddy we need
[37:54] you we love you and we're groaning to be
[37:56] like him how many groaning to be like
[37:58] Jesus tonight Eamon I just thought I'd
[38:00] share that little testimony there that
[38:01] meant a lot to me when I was wondering
[38:02] well I know brother branham preach it
[38:04] the church probably knows all about it
[38:06] they probably heard it before but I just
[38:08] feel led to preach this it's nice to get
[38:11] confirmation on the other end
[38:12] praise the Lord amen so let's look at
[38:14] Revelation chapter 5 and I just put that
[38:16] five on there because I can see it
[38:17] better on my iPad because it's not this
[38:19] big on my iPad but just so you know it's
[38:21] just chapter five so part two this of
[38:24] Revelation chapter five this is part 80
[38:26] of the revelation series by God's grace
[38:30] now just remember in verse 1 the Bible
[38:32] said in the right hand of him that sat
[38:34] on the throne a book written within and
[38:37] on the backside sealed with seven seals
[38:40] now we spent last week a big portion of
[38:43] last week going through the importance
[38:45] of a seal the Spirit of God crying Abba
[38:48] Father and then we looked at the
[38:50] confusion about this word backside so
[38:54] some people looked at that backside and
[38:56] I said oh there must be something on the
[38:58] backside that's not in the Bible and
[39:01] people have gone off on tangents on that
[39:03] on little doctrines here and there and
[39:05] whenever they do that with every false
[39:06] doctrine it always ends up in sin
[39:09] because it's the wrong seat of false
[39:11] doctrine is a wrong seat it's a demonic
[39:14] spirit it's a demonic influence and that
[39:17] seat if it keeps watered if they stay in
[39:19] that false doctrine it has to produce
[39:21] fruit corrupt fruit and that corrupt
[39:23] fruit produces death amen
[39:26] and so they've gone the wrong side to
[39:29] that but we've seen that we saw a showed
[39:31] you the quotes how brother Branham he
[39:32] said men would walk up to brother
[39:33] Branham and they'd say brother BAM
[39:35] there's God's gonna give us some
[39:37] revelation that's not even in the Bible
[39:38] and it'll give us a stronger faith to go
[39:41] in the rapture brother Branham said
[39:42] that's impossible because the Bible said
[39:44] we do not add one word or take one word
[39:46] away from the Bible and my man said the
[39:49] thing is we've just overlooked what's
[39:51] already written and so we need to look
[39:54] again at the Bible how many looking at
[39:55] the Bible tonight let me let me look at
[39:57] the Bible all week praise God you read a
[39:58] chapters every day hope you're reading
[40:00] more chapter
[40:01] amen as time goes on but that's what we
[40:04] looked at last week and we saw how this
[40:07] book was a seven sealed book and we
[40:10] showed the revelation that we showed how
[40:11] each seal has three parts to it it has a
[40:14] symbol form a reality form and a
[40:17] revelation form we looked at that last
[40:18] week and we showed how the seventh seal
[40:21] we we know all the seventh seal the
[40:23] seventh seal has been revealed to us we
[40:25] know what it is it's the day in the hour
[40:26] of the coming of Jesus Christ but it
[40:28] hasn't been open yet or it hasn't come
[40:31] to the reality form because we're still
[40:33] waiting for the rapture amen and we'll
[40:35] keep waiting will you wait patiently
[40:37] Church are you willing to wait patient
[40:39] come in your life will you still serve
[40:40] in the rest of your life or we get tired
[40:42] and maybe you know fall back in the
[40:44] world we know we won't do that if we've
[40:46] been sealed because we're sealed to the
[40:47] day of our redemption and the day of
[40:49] redemption is either when we get in the
[40:51] rapture or when we go to the grave and
[40:52] the angels of pack our souls to the next
[40:55] dimension praise God the sixth dimension
[40:56] amen that's our Redemption praise the
[40:59] Lord when we get to our theophany or we
[41:01] get swallowed up in life with the
[41:03] glorified body at the rapture amen
[41:05] now I want to look at this thought here
[41:07] tonight so I'm done reviewing let's look
[41:09] at this thought brother man over and
[41:11] over if you look it up in the message
[41:12] from 1961 on he keeps using this phrase
[41:15] the book of Redemption the book of
[41:17] Redemption the book of Redemption and so
[41:20] today I spent yesterday I spent most of
[41:22] my time looking at Revelation chapter 5
[41:24] from 61 and the breach today I spent a
[41:27] lot of time on the breach from 1963 it's
[41:30] the Sunday night sermon before he
[41:32] preached the first seal so in verse 9
[41:36] they sung a new song saying thou art
[41:40] worthy to take the book and to open the
[41:43] seals thereof for thou was slain and has
[41:46] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[41:49] every kindred and tongue and people and
[41:52] nation now I just want to read verse 10
[41:56] I don't have it here as I was listening
[41:59] I forgot to write this thought down but
[42:01] look at verse 10 everybody everybody got
[42:02] your Bible verse 10 and has made us unto
[42:07] our God kings and priests and we shall
[42:10] reign on the earth
[42:14] so the Bible says that all these when
[42:16] they see Jesus they're saying ma you've
[42:18] redeemed us by your blood we're out of
[42:20] every nation we're out of every tongue
[42:23] and and every kindred you you've
[42:25] redeemed us out of all these nations and
[42:27] then they say you redeemed us so much
[42:30] that you've made us kings and priests
[42:32] and we we will rule on the earth honey
[42:36] no that's the reward for the real
[42:38] overcomer I think it was in the Sardis
[42:40] Church age where God told that God Jesus
[42:42] said if you overcome you'll rule over
[42:45] the nation's hey man
[42:47] so the overcomer of every age will give
[42:50] it will be given dominion over a nation
[42:53] on the earth during the millennium and
[42:55] perhaps also during the future home
[42:58] we'll see about that
[42:59] but I know for sure during the
[43:01] Millennium now the reason I say maybe
[43:03] not future home is because mother man
[43:05] talks about how the bride will never
[43:06] leave his side
[43:08] and so if Jesus is in the future home I
[43:10] imagine we would just stay in the future
[43:12] home with him because the bride would be
[43:14] ever at his side that's what I would
[43:17] imagine but I could be wrong but I want
[43:19] to bring this point out in from verse 10
[43:21] he's made us kings of priests and we
[43:23] shall reign on the earth so they're
[43:26] saying here we are in heaven we see
[43:28] Jesus he's the Redeemer this is a book
[43:30] of redemption and so after all this is
[43:33] over Jesus is going to make us or rain
[43:36] on the earth he's going to let us rain
[43:38] on the earth and brother and brother ham
[43:40] says the Bible says right now right now
[43:42] we do not rain on the earth unless you
[43:46] want to try to go down to the the local
[43:48] government in Akron and you want to try
[43:50] to take over you can try to do that if
[43:51] you want but I imagine they'll call the
[43:53] cops within about 10 minutes of you
[43:55] saying I'm a king of this country
[43:58] I'm a priest of this country I imagine
[44:01] they might call you crazy but you see
[44:04] you and I are not raining now naturally
[44:07] that natural run train will come later
[44:09] praise God
[44:11] but I stand here I believe tonight has
[44:13] the redeemed of son of God and I believe
[44:16] that I'm ruling now I'm ruling over a
[44:19] territory now and it's this territory of
[44:22] my body this this corporal body this is
[44:24] the territory I'm ruling over
[44:26] now I'm a king over this body and I'm
[44:29] ruling over the sin that tries to live
[44:31] in this body and tempt me amen in this
[44:34] body amen
[44:35] and if I can rule over this this this
[44:37] clay if I can rule over this dirt this
[44:40] calcium and potash in a trump if I can
[44:42] rule over this now Jesus will trust me
[44:44] to rule over all the other clay amen
[44:46] during the Millennium amen but I first
[44:49] got to prove to the devil that I'm a
[44:51] king and priests right now and I'm happy
[44:54] to do that by His grace by the grace of
[44:55] God amen now I want to read a few quotes
[44:59] here I have some quotes out here I want
[45:00] you to catch what's happening in Chapter
[45:02] five now it can be a little confusing so
[45:07] towards the middle of the the sermon
[45:09] here I've got some notes about why this
[45:11] chapter can be confusing I'll be very
[45:13] honest it was confusing to me for many
[45:15] years and there's still some things I
[45:16] don't really understand but I want to
[45:18] bring out everything that I can clearly
[45:20] teach from the Word of God and from the
[45:22] thus saith the Lord's brother Adam said
[45:24] I want to teach those clearly by God's
[45:26] grace now Barrera says now we see that
[45:29] something was lost here because the
[45:30] Bible said so in the book here that has
[45:33] redeemed us
[45:34] what are we redeemed from something must
[45:38] have been lost because remember in verse
[45:40] 9 they say you've redeemed us so brother
[45:43] man says if we were redeemed we must
[45:45] have lost something are you with me so
[45:47] far
[45:47] we need redeemed because we had
[45:50] something lost from us or something was
[45:53] taken from us and so Jesus had to redeem
[45:55] and bring us back and this redeem means
[45:58] here to the whole creation the whole
[46:01] creation of mankind the whole creation
[46:03] of mankind needed redeemed praise the
[46:06] Lord
[46:07] something must have been lost before you
[46:09] can be redeemed there must be something
[46:10] that redeemed us back and all the
[46:12] inheritance that we had has been
[46:14] redeemed back then we must have
[46:16] something one time that we do not have
[46:17] now but this Lamb come to redeem see we
[46:21] had something we was lost from now
[46:25] notice what did we lose now brother man
[46:27] tells us what we lost he said it was
[46:29] given to him to have eternal life how
[46:31] many know he started off with eternal
[46:32] life he had an anointing on him of
[46:35] eternal life and purity and complete
[46:39] since by the Holy Spirit he had an
[46:41] anointing but it was temporary so it
[46:43] wasn't down in the soul but it was a
[46:45] temporary anointing it must have been on
[46:47] his flesh and on his mind because if it
[46:50] was in the soul brother you're sealed to
[46:52] the day of your redemption in this soul
[46:54] so you can't lose that seal in your soul
[46:57] are you with me so see that's why I got
[47:00] into a New Testament because he wouldn't
[47:02] write the Holy Ghost seal in your soul
[47:03] praise God and the Old Testament wasn't
[47:06] upon the soul it was just an anointing
[47:08] on the flesh and the mind but now in the
[47:10] New Testament we get a seal we get a
[47:12] permanent brand we get a permanent mark
[47:14] and Christ is sealed in and the devil
[47:17] sealed out hey man but see Adam had
[47:21] eternal life and as long as he ate from
[47:24] the tree of life which member it was not
[47:26] a literal tree he could go there and eat
[47:27] off the fruit it was the presence of God
[47:30] it was Jesus Christ's spirit that was
[47:33] the tree of life in the garden amen
[47:36] because if you do that if you make it a
[47:38] literal tree of life now then now you
[47:41] have two ways to eternal life you have
[47:43] the Holy Ghost and you have a natural
[47:44] tree and there's not two ways to turn
[47:47] alive there's only one way I did Jesus
[47:50] say I am one of the ways he said I am
[47:52] the way and that's why the the normal
[47:57] idea of the tree of knowledge he will be
[47:59] an apple tree that's why that's a bunch
[48:00] of nonsense because if you do that now
[48:03] you've got two ways to turn alive right
[48:05] you've got a natural out got an apple
[48:07] tree or our Tree of Life fruit or a
[48:09] banana or orange or apricot whatever you
[48:11] want to make it now you've got two ways
[48:13] to turn alive but we know that's not the
[48:15] truth we know there's only one way and
[48:18] God has given us that way and as long as
[48:20] Adam obeyed the Holy Spirit he had this
[48:22] anointing on him the same is true for us
[48:24] today as long as we obey the Word of God
[48:27] the anointing rests on us amen
[48:29] and even when we sin we don't lose the
[48:31] anointing in our soul and the church
[48:33] said if you're seeing with the Holy
[48:36] Ghost
[48:36] then the Bible said God dwells in you
[48:39] it's Christ in you and then no matter
[48:42] what you do up here no matter what you
[48:43] do out here
[48:44] you'll still God's anointing in your
[48:46] soul but yes if you sin and it
[48:49] you'll feel checked in here this guy
[48:50] will tell you that little dove will say
[48:52] you sinned you sin that will leave you
[48:55] in your soul it may leave your flesh and
[48:58] may leave your spirit but it cannot
[49:00] leave your soul because it's a seal unto
[49:02] the day of your Redemption just want to
[49:04] make that clear now Adam here he had
[49:07] eternal life and notice that he inherit
[49:10] the earth
[49:10] he was like an amateur God over the
[49:12] earth the earth who says everything was
[49:14] given under his hand he could do it ever
[49:16] he wanted to he named it and called it
[49:18] and done whatever he wanted he was truly
[49:19] a son of God so there's two things Adam
[49:23] lost well they may go together so it may
[49:26] be just one thing I just listed them
[49:28] separately so it could be just two I had
[49:30] him lost the anointing and Dominion but
[49:33] it could be one in the same maybe
[49:34] obviously the the Dominion went along
[49:36] with the anointing I just listed it so
[49:38] you knew okay because the Bible we'll
[49:39] get to the bible scriptures in just a
[49:41] moment now in the fall adam forfeit the
[49:43] title deed to that he fell free to Satan
[49:46] Satan took the title deed Adam was very
[49:48] slothful now look at this Adam was very
[49:50] slothful and he did not redeem his
[49:54] rights for he could not redeem his
[49:56] rights now that's interesting because
[49:58] you always wondered well what happened
[49:59] how did he get seduced by the serpent
[50:01] and where was Adam
[50:03] well it's interesting when Adam said
[50:05] Adam was very slothful so I don't know
[50:07] what I don't know I'm not gonna I'm not
[50:09] gonna inject something all I know is
[50:12] that in Matthew 13 Jesus said while men
[50:15] slept the enemy came and planted the
[50:18] tares amongst the wheat so perhaps Adam
[50:21] was sleeping or perhaps Adam was you
[50:23] know just napping I don't know I'm just
[50:25] saying brother BAM calls him slothful so
[50:27] at some point he was not keeping his
[50:29] post of duty like he ought to but Satan
[50:32] which does not rightfully own it but he
[50:35] possesses that he is the god of this
[50:37] earth the Bible said so not because he
[50:39] rightfully gets it but he possesses it
[50:41] now to get it
[50:42] Satan possesses that he holds it in his
[50:44] hand death is in his hand the earth is
[50:46] in his hand the world belongs to him
[50:47] every nation belongs to him he governs
[50:49] and controls that's Dominion the whole
[50:52] world and everything in the world Satan
[50:54] does now here's what the word Dominion
[50:57] means it means rule or domination so God
[51:00] said have dominion over the fish of the
[51:02] scene over
[51:02] all the air and every other living thing
[51:04] that moveth upon the earth so Adam was
[51:06] given Dominion or rule or domination now
[51:11] here's a scripture I don't know if you
[51:13] ever caught this but this ties in with
[51:15] the law of the kinsman redeemer while
[51:19] they promise them Liberty they
[51:20] themselves are the servants of
[51:22] corruption four of whom a man is
[51:25] overcome of the same is he brought in
[51:29] bondage
[51:30] now did you catch this Adam forfeited
[51:33] dominion over the earth and then because
[51:38] he forfeit it he was then in bondage to
[51:41] the sin nature and who was in charge of
[51:42] the sin nature the devil who is the
[51:45] father of lies the devil
[51:47] so when Adam was overcome by his own
[51:51] slothfulness he became a slave to the
[51:56] devil or the devil sin nature are you
[51:58] with me
[51:59] so that is a beautiful scripture there
[52:05] no passing notes okay okay thank you
[52:08] yeah if you guys yeah please no capacity
[52:10] notes okay gentlemen thank you and now
[52:15] look at this here the Bible tells us
[52:18] Adam now here's Adam right after he was
[52:20] slothful and the Bible said unto Adam he
[52:23] said because thou has hearken unto the
[52:24] voice of thy wife so here's here's how
[52:26] he is slothful in at least in one way
[52:28] there could have been others like I said
[52:29] he may have been sleeping I don't know
[52:30] but here's at least one way now is
[52:32] hearken unto the voice of that wife and
[52:34] has eaten of the tree which I commanded
[52:36] thee saying thou shalt not eat of it
[52:37] cursed is the ground for thy sake in
[52:40] sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days
[52:43] of thy life amen so what was one of
[52:47] Adams slothful acts he listened to his
[52:50] wife instead of the Word of God now
[52:54] that's the that's the that's the part of
[52:56] it that we see in the Bible the the sin
[52:58] part but often were we need to remember
[53:01] that Adam knew what he was doing Adam
[53:05] chose to take on Eve's sin because he
[53:08] loved her amen and that's the part you
[53:11] got to read between the lines - church
[53:13] amen
[53:14] the Bible said in verse Timothy - that
[53:16] knew what he was doing Adam was not
[53:18] deceived so this is what he did he
[53:21] listened to the voice of his wife above
[53:23] God because he thought well God's
[53:25] greater than I God can save my wife and
[53:27] God can save me God is so great and in
[53:30] doing that he became just like Jesus
[53:32] Christ amen
[53:33] he was a pre figure of Jesus Christ
[53:36] because Adam took on the sin it is it
[53:39] one took on the sin of his guilty wife
[53:41] that's what Jesus did although all of
[53:43] our curse was placed upon Christ amen
[53:47] and so the ground was cursed because of
[53:51] what Adam did we know that now here's
[53:54] the bond in Scripture the Bible said
[53:55] because there's the creature itself also
[53:57] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[53:59] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[54:02] the churn of God how many feel that
[54:03] bondage of corruption you're there's
[54:05] just something they're just sending your
[54:06] members how many hate that bondage I
[54:08] hate it there I hate it and only the
[54:11] head but ourselves also which have the
[54:13] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[54:15] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[54:18] for the adoption to it that is - it
[54:21] means that is that is waiting for the
[54:23] fourth of the adoption we cover that
[54:25] last week the redemption of our body
[54:27] amen so we are slaves we're slaves to
[54:30] corruption if time goes on we're all
[54:32] going to have a funeral right because
[54:35] we're under the bondage of corruption
[54:36] but there's something within us groaning
[54:39] for perfection waiting for a perfect
[54:41] body we know there's a perfect body
[54:43] there's something inside you that wants
[54:45] to control nature there's something
[54:47] inside you that wants to correct
[54:49] everything that's wrong there's
[54:51] something inside of you that wants the
[54:53] real and have dominion over this world
[54:55] what is it it's the Spirit of God it's
[54:57] that that real body that you have
[54:59] waiting it's that redemptive body it's
[55:01] the same thing that Adam had and Adam
[55:04] lost it for all of us but Jesus gives it
[55:06] back to us amen all glory there's
[55:09] something about me every time something
[55:11] bad happens I just want to be like a
[55:13] creator and break in there and destroy
[55:14] it and fix it how many feel that way
[55:17] every time somebody gets sick I did it
[55:19] every time I see a person in wheelchair
[55:20] I just want to go lay hands on them and
[55:22] raise them up don't you I just hate this
[55:26] bondage of corruption you just want to
[55:28] see everything back
[55:30] and in perfect order the way it should
[55:32] be that's because there's a part of
[55:34] inside of side of you something groaning
[55:36] inside of you if the Spirit of God
[55:38] waiting for everything to be back in
[55:40] order like it was for Adam oh yes Amen
[55:44] now here's the scripture better be
[55:45] included but if our gospel be hid
[55:47] remember we looked at that I went on
[55:49] Sunday night how the Bible said only
[55:53] Jesus friends will understand the
[55:55] mysteries of God only as friends if
[55:58] you're not a friend of Jesus you won't
[56:00] understand the mysteries of the New
[56:02] Testament and so here it is if our
[56:04] gospel be hid so if people do not
[56:06] understand those 12 mysteries it is hid
[56:09] to them that are lost it's because
[56:10] they're lost in whom the god of this
[56:12] world has blinded the minds of them that
[56:15] believe not lest the light of the
[56:17] glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[56:18] image of God should shine unto them oh
[56:20] I'm glad Jesus asked me to be his friend
[56:22] hey I'm glad I can understand the
[56:26] secrets of God the mysteries of God and
[56:28] not just understand them but I can
[56:30] actually apply them to my life and I can
[56:32] be born again because member you can
[56:35] understand all the mysteries and still
[56:37] not be born again well that's right but
[56:40] see many of the mystery most people have
[56:42] the mysteries hint to them they don't
[56:44] understand water baptism they don't
[56:46] understand the Godhead they don't
[56:48] understand the laughter they don't
[56:49] understand all of the seven stars the
[56:51] seven church age is the statue Birdman
[56:53] they don't understand these mysteries
[56:54] and that's because Satan has blinded
[56:56] them from the glorious gospel because
[56:59] he's given them the lust of the flesh
[57:00] the pride of life and the lust of the
[57:02] eyes and because they love that more
[57:04] than they love God that's right but
[57:07] thank God brother have said we're not in
[57:09] the world see there you are now look I
[57:11] don't mean the church Satan don't
[57:13] control the church he just controls the
[57:16] world
[57:16] oh saint doesn't control me tonight he
[57:20] wants to because of that bondage of
[57:22] corruption but what happens whenever
[57:24] that comes up and whenever it disagrees
[57:26] with the Word of God this word of God
[57:29] inside of me that's dumb inside of me it
[57:31] brings this body in the in the
[57:33] subjection of the word this spirit
[57:35] inside of me this life inside of me
[57:37] makes my body obey the Word of God you
[57:40] don't think there are times I don't want
[57:41] to go smoke a cigarette now my flesh
[57:44] you don't think there's times I don't
[57:45] want to go have a drink it and take off
[57:47] the pressure am I the only one I'm
[57:51] talking about my flesh my flesh will
[57:53] smell cigarettes and it likes it and
[57:55] I've got to say no and it's and the
[57:57] power of God has anchored me away from
[57:59] that for the last 17 years amen
[58:02] but it doesn't mean that my flesh my
[58:04] flesh is still slave to that it's drawn
[58:07] to that it wants to go by that but the
[58:10] the life inside of me it cruises
[58:12] crucifies that that a desire again and
[58:15] again and it has to be and it crucified
[58:18] it yesterday it crucified it today and
[58:21] it's gonna have to crucify tomorrow amen
[58:23] jesus said you cannot be my disciple
[58:25] unless you take up your cross daily and
[58:28] follow me that means every day you've
[58:31] got to crucify the lust of the flesh hey
[58:34] man you don't think there's times my
[58:36] eyes get all googly I like oh I like to
[58:38] have that new house or oh ma I like to
[58:41] get a new car you don't think my eyes
[58:42] get like that you don't think so we're
[58:46] all human we've all got to overcome this
[58:49] so what see Satan cannot control us
[58:52] because we are choosing to be controlled
[58:54] by Jesus amen hallelujah Debra his he
[59:01] Satan's a godless world jesus said he
[59:02] was he's the God of heaven and now you
[59:05] rightly don't own this he does not own
[59:08] him he fought for Adam for the title
[59:10] deed to it but all this stuff that we
[59:11] own eternal life and inherited of the
[59:14] earth and Jesus said in Matthew 5
[59:16] blessed are the meek for they shall
[59:18] inherit the earth now we don't have it
[59:21] now to see we don't have the earth now
[59:23] but if we are meek which means we we are
[59:26] so meek we put ourselves always below
[59:28] Jesus Christ
[59:29] that's what meekness is humility it's
[59:32] putting all your needs below Christ
[59:35] desires if you do that then you'll
[59:38] inherit the earth I don't even care what
[59:40] part of Earth I in here I don't care if
[59:42] I'm a ruler over Akron I don't care if
[59:44] it's Mozambique I don't I don't care if
[59:46] it's Canada I don't know I'm not sure
[59:48] what's in Canada or Greenland there's
[59:50] not much in Greenland I don't care of us
[59:52] Greenland but one thing I would I want
[59:54] to be meek I want to be like Christ I
[59:57] on him to have his way me praise God
[59:59] he's my Creator he has a plan he has a
[1:00:01] destiny for me he has a assignment for
[1:00:04] me to do and I want to submit to that I
[1:00:06] don't when they rebelled against that I
[1:00:08] want to obey his calling for my life and
[1:00:10] if he do if I do it reward me as a ruler
[1:00:13] and overcomer and he'll give me that
[1:00:15] dominion back that Adam lost and then I
[1:00:17] can be a true son of God a fall son of
[1:00:19] God with the full adoption of Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ hey man nah but we don't have it
[1:00:25] now oh but we will have it later by
[1:00:29] God's grace if we can just be meek if we
[1:00:32] can just control this body now during
[1:00:35] this lifetime if we can control this
[1:00:37] earth he'll make us ruler over this
[1:00:39] earth but man said Satan possesses it
[1:00:43] but he does not rightfully own it when
[1:00:46] the rightful owner lost it there's only
[1:00:48] one way it can be redeemed that's by
[1:00:50] near kinsman is the only one who can
[1:00:51] rightfully redeem it now of course we
[1:00:54] have this in the virgin birth of Jesus
[1:00:56] Christ so notice Satan possesses
[1:00:59] Dominion but it actually belongs to God
[1:01:01] Jesus Christ redeemed back this Dominion
[1:01:04] with his blood and we are enjoying a
[1:01:07] portion of that inheritance today are we
[1:01:09] not right like brother Ram would speak
[1:01:12] to the storm I could leave I never spoke
[1:01:13] to something and it happened right how
[1:01:16] many ever laid their hands on the sick
[1:01:17] and they recovered I never spoke in
[1:01:19] tongues or interpreter prophesy what you
[1:01:21] have is you have a portion of that that
[1:01:23] Dominion coming back but we're good
[1:01:25] we're promised the fullness as well amen
[1:01:29] glory now Bob Arum said I want to say
[1:01:33] something here and he goes to the
[1:01:35] Levitical loss of redemption I'm gonna
[1:01:37] skip right to it because of times sake
[1:01:38] I'm really not getting as far as I
[1:01:39] wanted to get tonight I'd like to you
[1:01:41] know further now I said the land shall
[1:01:44] not be sold for ever for the land is
[1:01:46] mine see your property is really not
[1:01:48] yours yeah for your strangers and
[1:01:51] sojourners with me God says and in all
[1:01:54] the land of your possession ye shall
[1:01:56] grant a redemption for the land so every
[1:01:59] land must be have this ability to be
[1:02:02] redeemed if thy brother be waxed and
[1:02:05] poor and I sold away some of this
[1:02:06] possession if any of us can come to
[1:02:08] redeem it then shall he redeem that
[1:02:10] which is brother's soul so let's say I
[1:02:13] had some land I sold some of it because
[1:02:15] I was getting down in the dumps I had
[1:02:17] some bad financial seasons my son
[1:02:19] Malachi could come back and buy that
[1:02:21] land because he's near kinsman my
[1:02:24] brother if it wasn't Malachi my brother
[1:02:26] Simon could come by and buy that land
[1:02:28] because he's kinsman to me and if the
[1:02:32] man have none to redeem it and himself
[1:02:34] be able to redeem it they let him count
[1:02:35] the years of the sale they're up and
[1:02:37] restored the over plus under the man to
[1:02:39] whom he sold it that he may return it
[1:02:41] under special so I could go back and I
[1:02:44] could go back and I could well I sold
[1:02:45] you that land but the law says I can buy
[1:02:48] back from you so I have to pay you the
[1:02:50] overplus or whatever was above and
[1:02:52] beyond from those years that you had it
[1:02:54] I have to pay that back to you but I can
[1:02:56] buy it back because it's actually mine
[1:02:58] God said so but if he be not able to
[1:03:02] restore it to him then that which his
[1:03:04] soul shall remain in the hand of him
[1:03:06] that have bought it until the year of
[1:03:08] Jubilee and the Jubilee it should go out
[1:03:10] and he shall return on his possession so
[1:03:13] if I can't buy it until the year of
[1:03:15] Jubilee then he that that man that I
[1:03:18] sold to will keep it until the year of
[1:03:20] Jubilee and the year of Jubilee
[1:03:22] he'd have to walk over there and say
[1:03:24] okay that's mine it's been 49 years but
[1:03:26] now it's mine I want it back and he had
[1:03:29] to give it back because God gave me that
[1:03:31] land that was my promise inheritance and
[1:03:33] God wants all children to have their
[1:03:35] inheritance amen first there's something
[1:03:39] God wants you to do on this earth
[1:03:40] there's some some job you're supposed to
[1:03:43] do some special assignment some position
[1:03:45] God wants you to rule over on this earth
[1:03:48] God has an inheritance and it's
[1:03:50] foreshadowed of course he has inherited
[1:03:52] to the future home but it's foreshadowed
[1:03:54] now we must look at our lives and see
[1:03:56] what does God want me to rule over help
[1:03:58] me to rule over all that God has given
[1:04:00] me it might be a father might be a
[1:04:03] mother it might be a farmer might be a
[1:04:05] doctor might be a pastor about whatever
[1:04:07] they're God's called you to be whatever
[1:04:08] whatever job he's called you to do you
[1:04:10] must rule over that now and it's your
[1:04:13] inheritance it'll bless you for that
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:15] he will burn I've said Oh hallelujah hmm
[1:04:20] I hope you Christians see it I hope you
[1:04:23] saw it while we read that he said we are
[1:04:24] the saw the earth God gave this to his
[1:04:27] sons he gave us the jurisdiction over
[1:04:29] all nature all animals all life
[1:04:31] everywhere but Adam our Father forfeited
[1:04:33] to Satan but where does it fall back to
[1:04:36] the rightful owner God who made it hey
[1:04:40] man so see we read all that to show we
[1:04:43] read it out of the laviticus 25 to show
[1:04:45] that that's a natural a type of the
[1:04:47] spiritual amen that God is going to give
[1:04:50] us back all those spiritual rights and
[1:04:53] Dominion that Adam had God's going to
[1:04:55] give it back to the bride amen and of
[1:04:57] course all the saints of the Old
[1:04:59] Testament okay now I think we can go to
[1:05:01] verse 2 now revelation 5 verse 2 and I
[1:05:04] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:05:05] loud voice who's worthy to open the book
[1:05:07] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[1:05:11] man in heaven nor in earth nor under
[1:05:13] this earth was able to open the book
[1:05:15] neither to look thereon and I went much
[1:05:18] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:05:20] read the book neither to look thereon
[1:05:23] and we'll stop right there here's a
[1:05:25] brother who says about these verses okay
[1:05:27] I already read that
[1:05:29] well the man said but John wept here's
[1:05:32] what I think he went for and now I've
[1:05:33] switched to the breach all the previous
[1:05:35] quotes were from Revelation chapter 5
[1:05:37] part 2 of 1961 I believe was June 11
[1:05:40] that I'm not mistaken he said here's
[1:05:42] where I think John went for because if
[1:05:44] no one was worthy and could open this
[1:05:46] book of redemption the whole creation
[1:05:49] was lost here's the book here's the
[1:05:53] title deed and it will be offered to the
[1:05:55] kinsman redeemer that can meet the
[1:05:57] qualifications
[1:05:58] that's God's own law and he can to
[1:06:01] follow his law I can't defy his law
[1:06:02] rather see God required a kinsman
[1:06:04] redeemer who was worthy who was able to
[1:06:06] do it who had the substance to do it and
[1:06:08] the angel said now let that kinsman
[1:06:10] redeemer step forward and John looked
[1:06:16] and he looked all over the earth
[1:06:17] he looked beneath her look at this John
[1:06:19] looks under the earth dad looks around
[1:06:22] me if he must have been pulled out he
[1:06:23] must had some real eagle eyes he can
[1:06:26] look all around the the sphere of the
[1:06:28] earth he can look inside the earth
[1:06:31] anything in there
[1:06:33] he looked everywhere and there is nobody
[1:06:35] worthy the creation everything was lost
[1:06:39] of course John what everything was lost
[1:06:41] he imagined how sad he was John knew all
[1:06:43] the Adam had Adam had all the power to
[1:06:46] control heaven and earth he had all that
[1:06:49] power and John and John knew if that
[1:06:53] book doesn't get opened if all the truth
[1:06:56] in that book of God's title deed there
[1:06:58] of redemption if that book doesn't get
[1:07:01] open we're lost we're going to forever
[1:07:03] remain like this where we're never going
[1:07:05] to be able to go back and be like Adam
[1:07:08] so there must have been something in
[1:07:09] John that was longing to be a ruler
[1:07:12] there must have been something John that
[1:07:15] was longing to be a king that was
[1:07:17] longing to be a priest that was longing
[1:07:19] to be a ruler how come all the good
[1:07:23] movies and we've you know and all the
[1:07:25] good books they're always so popular
[1:07:27] because they they make the main
[1:07:28] character become king or queen isn't
[1:07:31] that the goal of all the books and
[1:07:32] movies like the children like line which
[1:07:34] in the wardrobe what's the whole point
[1:07:36] of that these four children become kings
[1:07:38] and queens and they get the rule over
[1:07:41] all of Narnia and and the Christian man
[1:07:45] wrote that series you know he wrote that
[1:07:46] series and it was a filled with a lot of
[1:07:48] good types like the death and burial
[1:07:49] resurrection of Jesus Christ but what
[1:07:51] are all these stories about I can't
[1:07:53] remember some of the worldly movies like
[1:07:54] The Matrix I don't actually I saw up I
[1:07:55] don't remember it you know I was a
[1:07:56] sinner but you know like just any movie
[1:07:59] they're trying to get somebody to be a
[1:08:01] ruler somebody to be exalted why is that
[1:08:03] because it's a reality God is going to
[1:08:06] bring all of his children back to being
[1:08:08] miniature atoms on this other thing then
[1:08:11] they're not going to be full gods but
[1:08:13] they're going to be amateur gods are
[1:08:15] going to be just like Adam and they're
[1:08:16] gonna have creative power and God's
[1:08:18] gonna be able to trust them with that
[1:08:19] power hey man how do you and if you want
[1:08:23] to go create a world to live on it
[1:08:24] better I'm sayin you killin I imagine
[1:08:26] we'll all say on the earth because I
[1:08:28] really I want to be apart from you
[1:08:29] brothers I really would miss you if you
[1:08:32] know I know I got eternity but I might
[1:08:33] miss you you have the power you have all
[1:08:36] this power but God first has to put
[1:08:39] godly character in you first so he can
[1:08:43] trust you with that power so it's not
[1:08:44] satanic
[1:08:47] 9si everything was lost so jobs crying
[1:08:50] he said I will never I'll never get out
[1:08:52] of this state I'll never get back to me
[1:08:54] no I want to be like Adam was I want to
[1:08:56] be in the perfect condition I want to be
[1:08:58] a ruler I wanna have dominion on the
[1:09:00] earth and we'll never get back or unless
[1:09:02] this book gets open ha ha ha and it made
[1:09:06] him so sad he started crying he wept
[1:09:08] much the Bible says if you knew you were
[1:09:14] never going to get all those powers of
[1:09:16] Adam back would you cry I would because
[1:09:20] I feel like I was meant for more than
[1:09:21] this I was meant to be more than just a
[1:09:24] tired man you know it gets tired and
[1:09:27] headaches and gets you know I get sore
[1:09:30] and makes mistakes when I don't want to
[1:09:33] sister Connie I don't want to make
[1:09:35] mistakes but sometimes I make mistakes I
[1:09:37] would cry and weep I'll be so sad if I
[1:09:41] knew I had to remain like this forever
[1:09:42] but thank God John cried because he felt
[1:09:45] that same way he didn't want to remain
[1:09:47] in this farm condition he wanted to be
[1:09:49] fully adopted he were the full blessings
[1:09:52] of God he wouldn't be fully a child of
[1:09:54] God just like Adam started off oh that's
[1:09:58] how I feel to church and I cry many thro
[1:10:00] many times I've cropped assaulter I'm
[1:10:02] sure you cried in your prayer Clause as
[1:10:03] well I've cried groaning just wanting to
[1:10:06] be more like God wanting to be perfect
[1:10:08] wanting to be like Jesus wanting to see
[1:10:10] Jesus it'll make every true Christian
[1:10:12] cry praise God amen and church the
[1:10:17] longer I live the more I get
[1:10:18] disappointed in my flesh the more I feel
[1:10:21] my goodness help me Lord I need to live
[1:10:23] higher than this I can live higher than
[1:10:25] this but the body keeps getting more
[1:10:27] tired all the time
[1:10:28] Oh help me Jesus so the angel said I
[1:10:35] want a man that's able to do it I want a
[1:10:37] man that can redeem and he wasn't found
[1:10:38] so John broke out Oh everything was lost
[1:10:40] he wept bitterly he was so sad because
[1:10:43] everything the whole creation everything
[1:10:45] was gone if they couldn't find somebody
[1:10:48] imagine that all the creation would be
[1:10:50] gone all the animals that you loved all
[1:10:52] the mountains and all the Seas and all
[1:10:54] the trees in the forest
[1:10:55] all that would not be restored back
[1:10:57] because this book was not open this book
[1:10:59] had
[1:11:00] all the promises of God in it amen it'll
[1:11:03] all the names of the on the Lamb's Book
[1:11:05] of Life it had all these details it had
[1:11:07] everything of God's plan and if this
[1:11:09] doesn't get open if this doesn't get a
[1:11:11] release it won't happen and so John
[1:11:14] starts weeping bitterly he said they
[1:11:18] couldn't find somebody that could meet
[1:11:19] that requirement that every human being
[1:11:21] in the whole world in creation was gone
[1:11:23] so that means Satan would have kept that
[1:11:25] dominion and and we never would have got
[1:11:29] it back can you imagine if we had to
[1:11:30] keep living like this for eternity and
[1:11:32] Satan was always the god of this earth
[1:11:35] can you imagine that what an awful world
[1:11:38] that would be
[1:11:39] what a horrible awful evil world that
[1:11:45] would be with the Satan possessing those
[1:11:47] powers right that Dominion he said Oh
[1:11:52] everything had fallen the rites of
[1:11:53] redemption the rites of eternal life
[1:11:55] Elijah or all these rights have been for
[1:11:57] for there was nobody who could pay the
[1:12:00] price to get them back
[1:12:01] oh my verses five and six and one of the
[1:12:07] elders saith unto me weep not behold the
[1:12:10] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:12:12] David has prevailed to open the book and
[1:12:14] to loose the seven seals thereof and I
[1:12:17] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[1:12:18] who the four beasts in the midst of the
[1:12:20] elders stood a lamb as had been slain
[1:12:21] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:12:23] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:12:26] into all the earth now brother Ram said
[1:12:30] those seven eyes are the seven spirits
[1:12:32] he said on the seven church age
[1:12:34] messengers just so you know I'm not
[1:12:35] gonna spend a lot of time on this
[1:12:36] because I don't think it's really
[1:12:37] important to spend a lot of time on that
[1:12:39] because we've already covered it now who
[1:12:41] knows what the seven horns are brother
[1:12:43] Bram said it's the Church of each church
[1:12:45] age so Ephesus the the Holy Ghost
[1:12:48] anointed Church in Ephesus was like a
[1:12:50] horn on Jesus's head that's his power
[1:12:53] that's his weapon who's Jesus gave the
[1:12:56] keys to Jesus gave the keys to Peter
[1:12:57] right and now we have the Dominion or we
[1:13:00] have the power so each of the horns
[1:13:02] represents the bride in each church age
[1:13:05] because that was the power of Jesus
[1:13:07] Christ on the earth do you realize that
[1:13:09] you're the power of Christ tonight amen
[1:13:13] I am you are we're believers and we have
[1:13:15] faith in the Word of God we become the
[1:13:17] horror we become the power of Christ on
[1:13:20] the earth today amen how do you know
[1:13:24] because it's been powerful my life I
[1:13:26] drove all the demons out of my life
[1:13:28] hallelujah it drove all the addictions
[1:13:31] and the lusts and the evil thoughts and
[1:13:33] all the evil things in my life it drove
[1:13:35] them out by the power of the horn amen
[1:13:37] the power of the church in the church
[1:13:40] members they men the bride members so
[1:13:43] just so you know he says that in chapter
[1:13:46] or part 2 of Revelation chapter 5 and 61
[1:13:49] now back to the breach his crying didn't
[1:13:53] last but just a minute though isn't God
[1:13:57] so merciful you know we you know we we
[1:14:01] might have to we feel like sometimes we
[1:14:03] cry or we wait so long but look how
[1:14:05] merciful God is to John he not the crime
[1:14:07] very long Jesus just gave a little bit
[1:14:10] of drama not too much drama you don't
[1:14:12] feel like that God will give you just a
[1:14:13] little bit of drama just enough trials
[1:14:16] to make you look up to heaven The Crying
[1:14:21] did it last but a minute though and
[1:14:23] troubles don't last always out of that
[1:14:25] song troubles don't last always all
[1:14:29] right they'll come and go right he says
[1:14:32] but someone said don't weep John his
[1:14:35] crying it lasts a minute John thought oh
[1:14:36] my where's the man brother branham said
[1:14:39] look he said there stands the prophets
[1:14:41] remember he could see all around the
[1:14:42] earth he could look in heaven oh there's
[1:14:45] Abraham
[1:14:46] there's joke he said there stands the
[1:14:49] prophets there was born like I was there
[1:14:51] stands the sages there's a Zeki oh
[1:14:57] there's Enoch which one's going to
[1:15:01] prevail it was none of those guys hey
[1:15:04] and it wasn't the Virgin Mary either or
[1:15:06] Joseph hey then he said so many vermin
[1:15:09] who prevailed
[1:15:10] oh he's ain't there nobody here that can
[1:15:14] prevail and get that church often failed
[1:15:17] Elijah took a rapture Moses got raptured
[1:15:21] went to the grave we got raptured Enoch
[1:15:23] took a rapture and none of them were
[1:15:25] worthy so see just
[1:15:26] in the rapture doesn't make us worthy it
[1:15:28] doesn't make us somebody Jesus is the
[1:15:30] only somebody praise God very men in
[1:15:33] fact where they said he taught he was no
[1:15:35] different than anybody else he was just
[1:15:37] called to the rapture and that's like
[1:15:39] you and I we still sit and fall short
[1:15:40] and there's nothing really special about
[1:15:42] us other than God has chosen us and we
[1:15:44] are just called to go in the rapture
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:47] we must not worship the broad we must
[1:15:49] not worship ourselves all worship must
[1:15:51] go to Jesus Christ hey man a little
[1:15:56] later in the sermon you're gonna say
[1:15:57] brother that bromances is my name on
[1:15:59] that book and brother have said I hope
[1:16:00] so he doesn't brag like all my name's on
[1:16:04] there oh you better get your name on
[1:16:05] there because look at me I'm the prof of
[1:16:07] the hour
[1:16:08] he was never arrogant like that and God
[1:16:10] help us not to be arrogant like that
[1:16:12] help us to be humble so they all stood
[1:16:15] there in John's cycle which one is it
[1:16:17] one if it's going to be one of these
[1:16:18] guys and they're capable as for one of
[1:16:21] the elder standing in the midst of the
[1:16:22] four B's don't weep John oh my the grace
[1:16:25] of God don't be brokenhearted John don't
[1:16:26] weep for the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:16:28] the Rudolph's spring of David has
[1:16:30] prevailed and Berlin said prevail means
[1:16:32] to wrestle with and overcome so when did
[1:16:36] Jesus prevail grogram said in the Garden
[1:16:39] of Gethsemane uh the prevailing didn't
[1:16:45] take place in heaven the prevailing took
[1:16:47] place on earth and he had to prevail
[1:16:50] over his flesh that didn't want to do
[1:16:53] the win of God and he prevailed in
[1:16:55] prayer church amen god help us to
[1:16:58] understand how important is that you go
[1:17:01] to your prayer closet and pray when you
[1:17:04] go through trials because that's where
[1:17:06] you actually overcome amen
[1:17:08] Jesus didn't have a clause in the in the
[1:17:10] Garden of Gethsemane so he went off and
[1:17:13] prayed by himself and made his own
[1:17:14] spiritual closet and God rewarded him
[1:17:17] openly if you go in the closet God will
[1:17:21] reward you openly and the church said
[1:17:23] let's not be remembered brother have
[1:17:25] said the angel told him the technician
[1:17:27] the technician was going into the closet
[1:17:29] and praying and then all these sick
[1:17:32] people came out well see prayer changes
[1:17:35] you and you come out like a new
[1:17:36] Christian hey man that's exactly right
[1:17:40] the
[1:17:40] said don't you know the scripture and my
[1:17:42] man says see the angels always
[1:17:43] scriptural the little tent represents
[1:17:46] the prayer closet going and pray and
[1:17:48] you'll find healing by Jesus Christ to
[1:17:52] see when his blood dropped from his face
[1:17:53] he was overcoming still where to this
[1:17:57] lie and where this line overcome he
[1:18:00] overcome in prayer hallelujah now back
[1:18:05] to Revelation chapter 5 part 1 just then
[1:18:07] he said the elder came forth our strong
[1:18:09] angel we'd not he said he's conquered in
[1:18:11] other words he's worthy to take the book
[1:18:13] remember he hadn't seen him up to this
[1:18:16] time remember John looked in inside the
[1:18:19] earth he looked on top of the earth he
[1:18:21] looked up in heaven and he still hadn't
[1:18:23] seen Jesus he said no man is worthy he's
[1:18:27] looking he said seeing Jesus and all of
[1:18:29] a sudden the voice says hey there's the
[1:18:31] Lion of the tribe of Judah he's revealed
[1:18:34] and why sitting there see done I said
[1:18:37] why he was sitting there seated on a
[1:18:38] throne there in God's throne so for some
[1:18:42] reason he could see in heaven but he
[1:18:43] couldn't see the throne of God he was on
[1:18:47] the inside of the sanctuary he hadn't
[1:18:49] seen him too this time so John was
[1:18:51] expecting to see a lion but he saw a
[1:18:54] lamb the boy said a lion he turned to
[1:19:01] look and expect to see this ferocious
[1:19:02] creature and he sees a meek little lamb
[1:19:05] oh I hope that's how you are I hope
[1:19:08] there's a part of you that's bold and
[1:19:11] fierce and strong like I love it but I
[1:19:13] open people see you they see you as
[1:19:15] humble as a little lamb amen that God
[1:19:19] called me a line but I hope all of you
[1:19:21] see me as a humble little lamb and
[1:19:22] that's Scripture because the Bible says
[1:19:24] were like lambs delivered to the
[1:19:26] slaughter all the day long and the
[1:19:28] church said so in God's eyes we should
[1:19:32] be strong spiritually prayed up like
[1:19:34] lions but when someone offends us were
[1:19:38] like a little lamb I know you didn't
[1:19:40] mean that
[1:19:42] right oh I forgive you brother or
[1:19:44] forgive me sister I didn't mean to say
[1:19:46] that against you we should be so humble
[1:19:48] like the land and the reason I'm saying
[1:19:50] that is because that's what brother
[1:19:51] Graham says next look what he says he
[1:19:54] said here comes a land look a brother
[1:19:55] says there you are
[1:19:57] brothers so that's all of us through
[1:20:00] meekness through sweetness through the
[1:20:03] Holy Spirit that we conquer he look to
[1:20:08] see a line a mighty conquer and he sees
[1:20:10] a lamb how do we conquer the devil
[1:20:13] through the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:15] oh Jesus I love you Oh forgive me Lord I
[1:20:19] didn't mean it or forgive me brother
[1:20:20] sister help me to hunt lord help me to
[1:20:22] humble myself I'm just gonna obey the
[1:20:24] Word of God now you're overcoming
[1:20:26] instead of splitting the church and
[1:20:28] getting upset and cursing your brother
[1:20:30] and sister and saying they're just a
[1:20:31] Surrency they're just a devil that's a
[1:20:33] wolf spirit not a lamb spirit hello
[1:20:36] Church how did Jesus overcome me that's
[1:20:39] like it he said he's alive he looked at
[1:20:40] him and he's a slain lamb like a slain
[1:20:42] lamb like he just got freshly cut he's
[1:20:46] bloody and bleeding where is this mighty
[1:20:49] conker he's a bloody bleeding lamb
[1:20:52] bloody brother Ram said like he just got
[1:20:54] slain and brother Brahim said that's a
[1:20:58] lesson for us not some great mighty
[1:21:01] intellectual giant but he that can
[1:21:06] humble himself the intellectual Giants
[1:21:09] inherit the earth is that what Jesus
[1:21:11] said he said the meek inherit the earth
[1:21:15] is the man who conquers the man who can
[1:21:19] be kicked around and still be a servant
[1:21:23] of Christ well I'm leaving this church
[1:21:26] because this is sister so-and-so brother
[1:21:28] to treat mistreated me I won't be kicked
[1:21:31] around like this and brother branham
[1:21:35] said no the real sermon is the one who
[1:21:37] gets kicked around like a humble little
[1:21:40] lamb in that something doesn't that go
[1:21:46] against our thinking church didn't David
[1:21:50] it's better to be the doorkeeper and be
[1:21:54] in the house of God than being the tents
[1:21:56] of the wicked I would rather just keep
[1:21:58] the door
[1:21:59] alright Saints come on I remember when I
[1:22:01] first became a deacon over in Lima I was
[1:22:03] so thrilled brother William people just
[1:22:05] walk in the door I could open the door
[1:22:06] say come on in god bless you I was happy
[1:22:08] as a lark
[1:22:09] I just loved open the door now I miss I
[1:22:13] missed here in the preaching because I
[1:22:14] had to open the door for the kids using
[1:22:15] the bathroom you know the adults and the
[1:22:17] moms nursing I kind of missed the
[1:22:19] certain the preaching but I thought well
[1:22:20] at the beginning I loved it I just
[1:22:22] wanted to be serving God's people who
[1:22:24] else would I want to be around other
[1:22:26] than the Holy Ghost field sinks and
[1:22:27] David said that rather be a doormat or
[1:22:30] I'd rather be a doorkeeper and be in the
[1:22:33] house of god than to dwell with the
[1:22:35] wicked sinners well fine I'm leaving the
[1:22:38] church and I ain't even coming back to
[1:22:39] church you need to get born again
[1:22:41] because the born to get lamb doesn't
[1:22:43] mind getting kicked around a little bit
[1:22:45] it kicked it around a bit well they're
[1:22:47] just kicking me around today oh they
[1:22:49] just kicked me around last Sunday that's
[1:22:51] okay
[1:22:52] as long as I'm in the house of God
[1:22:53] that's all that matters Jesus had to be
[1:22:56] kicked around by his own disciples he
[1:23:01] drove him since he got kicked around and
[1:23:05] he said get behind me Satan right he's
[1:23:09] got to get kicked around oh don't you
[1:23:10] believe don't you know what the
[1:23:12] unleavened bread that means it's not
[1:23:14] bread it's me or the leavened bread it's
[1:23:16] the doctrine of the Pharisees don't you
[1:23:18] understand that they said master don't
[1:23:21] you know who touched you all these
[1:23:23] people out there don't you know who
[1:23:24] touched you sometimes you got to get
[1:23:27] kicked around Church sometimes you got
[1:23:30] to take the wrong sometimes people got
[1:23:33] to mistreat you and if you stay and
[1:23:35] humble yourself and just be a sweet
[1:23:38] Christian you just overcame but the
[1:23:43] world wants are they gonna find out go
[1:23:45] I'll take my membership else well well
[1:23:46] if you're believing in membership then
[1:23:48] you need to join a denomination we're
[1:23:51] not members of a church we're born in
[1:23:53] the church God don't have spiritual
[1:23:57] grandchildren children and if you're in
[1:24:00] the place where you need to be there's
[1:24:01] no other place you'll fit in is other
[1:24:03] than the place where God meant you to be
[1:24:04] praise God
[1:24:06] it's a man who can kicked around and
[1:24:09] still be a servant of Christ that's the
[1:24:10] conquer
[1:24:12] now he's prevailed he's worthy to take
[1:24:15] the book and open it and loose the seals
[1:24:18] thereof so what's programs lesson he
[1:24:20] looks to see a lion he sees the lamb
[1:24:23] what's real Rams lesson we got to be
[1:24:26] humble if we're gonna conquer the devil
[1:24:28] be strong like a lion would be humble
[1:24:31] like a lamb be sweet like a lamb may God
[1:24:36] help us to be like that how many want to
[1:24:37] be sweet like a lamb sweet that means
[1:24:42] you don't get bitter you don't have
[1:24:44] roots of bitterness build up in you boy
[1:24:46] if I had Jose add them I put him between
[1:24:48] a rock and a hard place and I'd squeeze
[1:24:50] and I take brother William I think Malik
[1:24:53] God I'd squeeze him like this you know
[1:24:59] that's how some people think brother
[1:25:01] William you probably seen it in churches
[1:25:02] homes that you probably seen in churches
[1:25:04] if I could just give that guy a real
[1:25:07] little girl if I could just straighten
[1:25:10] out her mind a little bit
[1:25:11] that's not very meek that looks like a
[1:25:14] wolf and not a lamb as we said see we
[1:25:19] have to see and understand that this is
[1:25:21] how Christ lived Christ lived like a
[1:25:23] lamb he could just be beat around most
[1:25:27] of time there's times we know yeah he
[1:25:28] took those he took the cords and he
[1:25:30] whipped him in the in the temple there's
[1:25:31] time see that but most the time he's
[1:25:32] getting kicked around so we understand
[1:25:34] that most of time he was getting kicked
[1:25:36] around but man said John had it notices
[1:25:41] lamb before you know here he had he
[1:25:43] mentioned him before nowhere
[1:25:45] had it been mentioned John didn't see it
[1:25:46] all over the heavens is he looking but
[1:25:48] here come forth where to come from it
[1:25:50] come from the Father's throne where he'd
[1:25:52] been seated since he'd been slain and
[1:25:53] raised again he raised up and sat in the
[1:25:57] right hand of God ever living to make
[1:25:59] intercession so program says that he
[1:26:01] came forth from the throne which was a
[1:26:03] sanctuary and other courts he says he
[1:26:05] came from the mediatorial box
[1:26:07] kinda like the holiest of holies was
[1:26:09] like a small room like a
[1:26:11] box like the holy place and the holiest
[1:26:13] source was like a box but rare so there
[1:26:15] must have been a box in heaven because
[1:26:17] John didn't see Jesus right away oh I
[1:26:21] love this he says every living to make
[1:26:23] intercession amen raised there today as
[1:26:26] an intercessor with his own blood to
[1:26:28] make intercessions upon the ignorance of
[1:26:30] the people upon my ignorance oh now
[1:26:33] that's the one I'm depending on he's
[1:26:36] still covered with bleach the bleach of
[1:26:37] the forgiveness of sin are you depending
[1:26:39] on Christ tonight are you depending on
[1:26:42] his blood to be bleached to your sins
[1:26:45] are you depending on that I am to that
[1:26:48] that's if brother Branham depended on
[1:26:49] him when he was 55 years old
[1:26:50] I'll defend him when I'm 37 amen now
[1:26:53] I'll keep depending on him all the days
[1:26:54] of my life to be my bleach but RAM said
[1:26:59] isn't it strange a simple lamb had to
[1:27:01] take our place he saw the lamb he
[1:27:04] proceeded out John had a saw him because
[1:27:05] he'd been way back into the eternities
[1:27:07] even making intercession and showing
[1:27:09] those who had come to God under the
[1:27:11] offering of blood of bulls and goats a
[1:27:12] substitutionary offering them who have
[1:27:14] believed it pointed it to him and the
[1:27:18] blood and not yet been shed yet so there
[1:27:19] he was to clear them he was there to
[1:27:21] clear you and I oh god I hope he's there
[1:27:23] tonight for every sinner the lamb has
[1:27:25] been slain oh oh so he brother answered
[1:27:29] way back in the eternity 'he's see
[1:27:32] because there's no time in heaven and
[1:27:33] the church said god keeps track of it
[1:27:36] down on earth but internally you lose
[1:27:38] track of time now here's why this
[1:27:41] chapter can be a little confusing here's
[1:27:48] a quo
[1:27:49] some people misunderstand now this quote
[1:27:52] puts revelation 10-6 in the future like
[1:27:55] it hasn't happened yet but member
[1:27:57] brother Bram said in what is a traction
[1:27:58] on the mountain he said revelation ten
[1:28:00] one to seven was history and now listen
[1:28:04] it's not brother branham's fault if
[1:28:07] people get mixed up and get a false
[1:28:09] doctrine it's not their fault
[1:28:10] it's their fault because they're not
[1:28:12] born again because if you're born again
[1:28:14] the Holy Ghost leads you into all truth
[1:28:17] that way program makes a mistake it's
[1:28:19] okay the Holy Ghost will make you look
[1:28:21] over that and find the truth well
[1:28:25] program was just such a Kentuckian he
[1:28:26] confuses me all the time no you need to
[1:28:28] lean on the Holy Ghost a little more he
[1:28:31] may make mistakes he yes he was a
[1:28:32] Kentuckian he wasn't perfect but if we
[1:28:35] get confused it's not our fault it's
[1:28:37] because we need to ask the Holy Spirit
[1:28:39] for the answer because no man is perfect
[1:28:42] you can't make brother branham God you
[1:28:44] can't make me God you can't make any
[1:28:46] pastor God you've got to make God God
[1:28:48] amen you've got to lean upon the Holy
[1:28:50] Ghost to understand the Word of God so
[1:28:54] here's a quote they misunderstood then
[1:28:57] it is he the land that takes his kingly
[1:28:59] position when the saints come to crown
[1:29:01] him Lord and Lord and King of Kings see
[1:29:03] time has run out revelation ten six then
[1:29:05] there's time I'm sure then there's no
[1:29:08] more time so see this makes it look like
[1:29:10] it's future when Jesus has already taken
[1:29:12] his position after the rapture then time
[1:29:16] is no more so that would place
[1:29:17] revelation 10 1 to 7 as future after the
[1:29:21] rapture but brother Graham said it's
[1:29:22] already history so see people would
[1:29:25] misunderstand this one here's another
[1:29:27] one they misunderstand this one makes it
[1:29:30] seems like when the seals are broken
[1:29:33] there's no more mercy and this is why we
[1:29:35] have a lot of false doctrines about this
[1:29:37] one people say well the seals are Jesus
[1:29:40] left the mercy seat so there's no more
[1:29:42] mercy Jesus took the book he opened the
[1:29:45] seal so there's no more mercy no more
[1:29:46] people can be saved that's an awful
[1:29:47] false doctrine so see they misunderstand
[1:29:50] this but RAM said when the lamb was
[1:29:52] slain he walked forward from his
[1:29:53] eternity out of the Father's throne and
[1:29:55] took his rights
[1:29:56] it was judgment seat so people will read
[1:29:59] revelation 5 and they'll say Jesus took
[1:30:01] the book and they'll take this
[1:30:03] and say okay well if the books open now
[1:30:06] it's the judgment-seat no more people
[1:30:07] can be saved and that's an awful awful
[1:30:11] false doctor to see they need to pray
[1:30:15] about that a little longer they
[1:30:18] misunderstood brother Branham or maybe
[1:30:20] my brother Brad miss said it or he's had
[1:30:22] some words the wrong way
[1:30:23] either way the Holy Ghost won't lead you
[1:30:25] to make a false doctrine that becomes
[1:30:27] heresy in the church
[1:30:30] now here's my opinion revelation 5 took
[1:30:34] place some time I believe revelation 5
[1:30:36] is history - I could be wrong brothers I
[1:30:38] could be wrong but I believe its history
[1:30:40] I believe it took place sometime around
[1:30:43] 1963 since brother Graham said thus
[1:30:45] saith the Lord that the church ages and
[1:30:48] the seals are already been preached so
[1:30:51] if that means that if the if they are
[1:30:53] thus saith the Lord and the seals have
[1:30:55] been revealed and the seals have been
[1:30:56] loosed then to me revelation 5 has
[1:30:59] already taken place but I could be wrong
[1:31:01] Church I'm not trying to exalt with look
[1:31:03] at me I'm so revel a 'td I'll tell you
[1:31:06] I'll be more Revelator when I'm more
[1:31:07] humble so were you
[1:31:09] is that right Church because Paul got so
[1:31:13] much revelation God had to give him I
[1:31:15] trouble to humble him and I don't want I
[1:31:17] trouble I'd rather be humble without
[1:31:18] that trouble but you know Paul needed
[1:31:20] that and you know God might God knows we
[1:31:22] might need it too sometimes he heard
[1:31:25] program said today he has to make you
[1:31:26] sick to make you appreciate mean well
[1:31:29] sometimes this does get sick to Humble
[1:31:31] us because God has revealed so much to
[1:31:33] us he wants us to remain humble and not
[1:31:35] get prideful also I believe this church
[1:31:39] if revelation 5 took place then I
[1:31:41] believe this then the lamb after he
[1:31:43] loose the seals must have went back and
[1:31:45] sat down after the opening of the seals
[1:31:47] in order to do more mediatorial work
[1:31:51] that not just my opinion then at the
[1:31:55] time of the rapture I'll stand up again
[1:31:57] and claim all the names in the book of
[1:32:00] life he will then descend and meet his
[1:32:02] wife in the air that's just my thought I
[1:32:05] I could be wrong but if you place that
[1:32:09] in the future if you place revelation
[1:32:11] five like it hasn't happened yet what do
[1:32:13] you got you then the seals aren't open
[1:32:15] yet
[1:32:15] and brother Ram
[1:32:17] Jonah's already in the symbol form the
[1:32:19] reality form and the revelation form on
[1:32:21] for them are already fulfilled right and
[1:32:25] now the fifth sixth and seventh we're
[1:32:27] still waiting for a few of those forms
[1:32:28] to be fulfilled
[1:32:30] does everybody understand if it's
[1:32:32] confusing program said time and time
[1:32:35] again and I do the same thing Church if
[1:32:36] it's confusing I got to go back and
[1:32:38] listen to it again so this is confusing
[1:32:41] pray go back and listen this sermon
[1:32:43] again I may preach it again so you know
[1:32:45] it may not have to go back and listen to
[1:32:47] it again alright now let me show you
[1:32:49] mercy is over brother Han tells us mercy
[1:32:52] is over at the reality opening of the
[1:32:55] Seventh Seal let me prove that to you so
[1:32:59] in other words when revelation 8:1
[1:33:00] happens and there's silence in heaven
[1:33:03] for the space half hour there's
[1:33:05] lightning thunderings proceeding out of
[1:33:06] the throne in Revelation chapter 8
[1:33:07] that's when the judgment seat is that's
[1:33:10] when the mercy seat becomes a judgment
[1:33:12] seat here's where he says this is in the
[1:33:15] breech remember he'd been on the
[1:33:17] mediator work back there but remember
[1:33:19] these seals are ready to be open and the
[1:33:21] lamb come from the sanctuary of God
[1:33:23] advance forward wait till we get that
[1:33:25] over there one hour and take that 1/2
[1:33:27] hour that is silent that's revelation
[1:33:30] 8:1 and the church said this is
[1:33:33] revelation 8 what right here yeah the
[1:33:36] sanctuary smoking I'm going to show it
[1:33:38] to you it's Revelation chapter 8 there's
[1:33:39] no more intercession the sacrifice has
[1:33:41] left because they hit down the rapturous
[1:33:43] bride amen it's a judgment see there's
[1:33:47] no blood in it anymore for the blood
[1:33:49] covered lamb has walked away wait till
[1:33:52] you get to that time here's where it is
[1:33:55] revelation 8:1 there's silence in heaven
[1:33:57] the space half hour and then a sensor
[1:34:00] and then what happens with the sensor
[1:34:01] where is it
[1:34:02] yeah smoke but that said that altar
[1:34:05] smoky there it is this revelation 8 is
[1:34:09] when the throne becomes a judgment scene
[1:34:11] not revelation 5 revelation 8 and the
[1:34:14] church said I prove it to you right
[1:34:16] there with a quote and the scripture and
[1:34:19] now our seven angels begin to sound the
[1:34:22] seven trumpets which brother Graham said
[1:34:23] all seven trumpets sound from the two
[1:34:26] prophets of the revelation chapter
[1:34:27] eleven under the sixth seal praise God
[1:34:30] after the raptures are
[1:34:31] taking place amen and so brother branham
[1:34:37] the way he preached this I believe God
[1:34:39] was still revealing to him some of these
[1:34:41] things brother Graham had to come back
[1:34:42] over a year and three months later and
[1:34:44] tell everybody that mercy is still
[1:34:46] available even though the seals are open
[1:34:48] they're still mercy today aren't so glad
[1:34:50] aren't you glad for questions and
[1:34:52] answers oh my those were some of the
[1:34:54] most helpful sermons when I first come
[1:34:55] in the message so if you should have
[1:34:57] questions about things he developed into
[1:35:01] all four since 1964 they will bless your
[1:35:03] soul I just used to listen to him over
[1:35:05] and over and they clear up so much
[1:35:06] confusion in my life they say brother
[1:35:09] branham some say mercy is over and no
[1:35:11] one can be saved is that true he said
[1:35:14] I'm glad I got this one we watch them
[1:35:17] pray we watch the paralyzed and it seems
[1:35:19] some are still finding mercy how many
[1:35:21] former see when you got saved oh oh I'm
[1:35:24] so glad that mercy rewrote my life
[1:35:27] brother brother owes them so bad God
[1:35:29] saved a wretch like me
[1:35:30] oh thank you Jesus I found mercy in my
[1:35:34] life program so that's the first
[1:35:37] question his mercy over don't never
[1:35:39] think that see you would never think it
[1:35:43] because when Mercy's over you're gone as
[1:35:48] long as you're here Mercy's here amen
[1:35:51] but when you're gone
[1:35:53] Mercy's gone hey man that's my program
[1:35:56] said don't you never think that as long
[1:35:58] as you're here because for you to be
[1:36:00] here the blood of Christ still has to be
[1:36:02] available in heaven because you need the
[1:36:05] blood of Christ you love the blood of
[1:36:07] Jesus Christ and you live for the blood
[1:36:09] of Jesus Christ amen so as long as
[1:36:12] you're here
[1:36:12] there's mercy I don't like you hiding
[1:36:17] the mercy every day I never got to a day
[1:36:19] yet by the way where I didn't need God's
[1:36:21] mercy to forgive me of something I did
[1:36:23] wrong something I thought or said that
[1:36:26] was foolish I should not have said it
[1:36:27] because I need God's mercy every hour he
[1:36:31] said don't think that just keep right on
[1:36:33] doing everything you can until you're
[1:36:35] taken away I love this
[1:36:39] he says we noticed the prayer lines some
[1:36:41] finds mercy sure mercy the doors are
[1:36:43] open he said I think where you got this
[1:36:45] the thought lay between I don't have
[1:36:46] time to give each of these scriptures
[1:36:48] right their place but each of these
[1:36:50] things their right place in the prayer
[1:36:52] line if I'm mercy now look at this if I
[1:36:54] know Jesus was coming this afternoon I'd
[1:36:59] be doing just the thing I'm doing right
[1:37:01] now
[1:37:02] just continuing right on Mercy is always
[1:37:06] open do you remember in the seals
[1:37:07] brother Ram said if I knew the rapture
[1:37:09] was this week he said I would be in
[1:37:11] church right now preaching to the God's
[1:37:12] elect
[1:37:14] praise the Lord do you think church is
[1:37:17] important then to God hey bro grant knew
[1:37:20] the rapture was this week he would not
[1:37:22] skip Church to try to save souls he'd be
[1:37:24] at his post of duty right where God
[1:37:26] wants him feeding God's sheep God
[1:37:28] wouldn't want his sheep to miss one meal
[1:37:30] on the Word of God ha ha ha amen because
[1:37:33] we had to promise all that the father's
[1:37:35] give me will come to me so if God calls
[1:37:38] us the faithful church attendance
[1:37:39] brother man have said every Christian
[1:37:41] should have a home Church and he said if
[1:37:44] the love of God is in you he said you'll
[1:37:46] be in church every time the doors open
[1:37:48] amen he said you can't wait to get to
[1:37:50] the house of God if you got the Holy
[1:37:52] Ghost inside of you because it's
[1:37:53] fellowship you get the worship your
[1:37:55] Creator I know Jesus was coming tonight
[1:38:01] I'd be preaching tonight oh the blood of
[1:38:04] Jesus Christ the mediator he's redeemed
[1:38:07] us back and in a moment we'll be gone
[1:38:09] would that be glorious amen
[1:38:11] if we knew he was coming back tonight
[1:38:15] hmm that's how much God thinks of your
[1:38:18] post of duty Church that's how much God
[1:38:21] thinks of us being in the house of God
[1:38:22] worshiping him I'd say it doesn't look
[1:38:25] like much but in God's eyes it's a
[1:38:27] beautiful thing it's God's children
[1:38:29] gathering around his word gathering at
[1:38:31] his table how many parents like when
[1:38:33] your children maybe they get older moved
[1:38:36] away
[1:38:36] I wonder how William felt when he first
[1:38:38] got to the table and had his first meal
[1:38:40] and years with his daughter Naomi how'd
[1:38:42] you feel brother
[1:38:45] that must have been the great feeling
[1:38:47] just to sit down and enjoy some
[1:38:49] fellowship reach across the table
[1:38:52] hold hands eat some food laugh together
[1:38:56] and that's what the Bible that's what it
[1:38:58] is when you come to church you gather on
[1:39:00] your father's throat and he feeds you
[1:39:01] all the good foods that children you
[1:39:03] like this is this good preach and you
[1:39:05] like the Word of God because remember
[1:39:07] there's only one preacher that's Christ
[1:39:09] I'm no preacher I can't help anybody but
[1:39:12] if you love God God will feed you every
[1:39:13] time you come to the house of God amen
[1:39:16] and now where I get is the finishing of
[1:39:20] the seven church ages in the seven seals
[1:39:21] being lived so see brother Aaron tells
[1:39:22] us why people thought mercy was over
[1:39:24] they misunderstood the church ages in
[1:39:27] the seals the seven seals it's
[1:39:30] manifested what takes place has what is
[1:39:32] took place the seven church age were at
[1:39:34] the end of the seven churches when I say
[1:39:36] the end that doesn't mean at this very
[1:39:38] hour this very minute oh thank you
[1:39:44] brother Rams but see if you had the Holy
[1:39:45] Ghost you would not have been confused
[1:39:47] on that because the Holy Ghost will
[1:39:50] answer your question he'll lead and
[1:39:51] guide you into all truth you remember
[1:39:54] the Bible said back in the days Lord
[1:39:56] Jesus Paul said for the time is at hand
[1:39:59] Peter said that over and over again be
[1:40:01] ready the time is at hand you know what
[1:40:03] kind of life should we live becoming a
[1:40:04] lord is soon and it's been 2,000 years
[1:40:07] since Peter said that you realize how
[1:40:10] long that was in God's time that was
[1:40:11] just yesterday because one day with God
[1:40:16] is as a thousand years with man it's
[1:40:19] just been dude two days since Paul was
[1:40:21] preaching on the earth it's just been
[1:40:22] two days what God calls at hand is not
[1:40:27] what we call it hand so just keep on
[1:40:29] believing brothers sisters keep on
[1:40:31] praying God still got mercy open just
[1:40:34] keep flowing into it as fast as you can
[1:40:39] God will do the stopping when it's time
[1:40:42] to stop how many want to flow into God's
[1:40:44] mercy
[1:40:46] I want mercy to flow into me do amen
[1:40:49] okay I didn't get this one but there's a
[1:40:51] quote from questions and answers
[1:40:52] they asked brother Branham is the latest
[1:40:54] in church over he says no he said the
[1:40:56] letter saying the latest in church age
[1:40:58] does not end until the rapture takes
[1:41:00] place some people say oh we're not in
[1:41:03] the lair to see it we're in the bride
[1:41:05] age well yeah yes and no yeah you're in
[1:41:08] the bride age when you have the baptism
[1:41:09] Holy Ghost but your body is still in
[1:41:11] Laodicea
[1:41:12] let me follow you around the whole day
[1:41:14] if you say I'm in the marriage
[1:41:15] let me follow you're on the whole day
[1:41:17] and I'll point out and show you how
[1:41:18] you're still living in labor to see it
[1:41:19] because you'll eventually sin amen
[1:41:23] Church eventually I'll point I'll just
[1:41:25] be that little angel on your shoulder
[1:41:27] and pretty soon I'll see where you say
[1:41:28] something wrong or you do something
[1:41:29] wrong you look at something you should
[1:41:31] not look at oh yes you are stood so you
[1:41:34] can't send the bride age see you're
[1:41:37] still it you're still able to see yeah I
[1:41:39] wonder how many wood bouncer yeah follow
[1:41:41] me around mo just follow me around all
[1:41:43] day show me where I'm wrong I don't
[1:41:45] think I'd move Allen to you for that now
[1:41:48] this is beautiful look what brother BAM
[1:41:49] says maybe I can close after this I
[1:41:51] didn't get to all of it but I better
[1:41:52] close up this brother BAM tells us what
[1:41:56] Jesus actually means when he steps
[1:41:58] forward and takes the book he goes
[1:42:00] through this list of what Jesus is
[1:42:02] actually saying with his words although
[1:42:03] he's not saying it this is what his
[1:42:05] actions mean when he comes forth and
[1:42:08] takes the book out of the right hand of
[1:42:10] him who sat upon it in other words the
[1:42:11] eternal spirit Jesus comes out looking
[1:42:14] all bloody
[1:42:14] he's like a lamb he's all bloody he
[1:42:17] comes and takes the book it must be
[1:42:18] floating there I don't know who must be
[1:42:20] floating there by the throne of the
[1:42:21] rainbow or something or by the four
[1:42:23] beasts or something like that
[1:42:25] before cherubims and he comes and takes
[1:42:27] the book here's what bro Graham said
[1:42:29] Jesus would would actually have said if
[1:42:32] he could have been talking to this
[1:42:34] moment notice he's not an animal so he
[1:42:38] wasn't a literal lamb he took the book
[1:42:41] out of the right hand of him that set up
[1:42:42] on the throne who was it the owner of
[1:42:44] the original owner that had the book of
[1:42:45] redemption in his right hand and no
[1:42:47] angel no angelic being nothing else
[1:42:49] could take the place and this bloody
[1:42:51] lamb walked out and took the book out of
[1:42:53] his hand what is it brother this is the
[1:42:56] most sublime
[1:42:59] in the scripture a act that not an angel
[1:43:03] not nothing could do it and the lamb
[1:43:06] come and took it from the right hand of
[1:43:08] him that said upon the throne what is it
[1:43:10] now it belongs to the lamb amen
[1:43:14] did you catch that chapter 5 is the most
[1:43:18] sublime act in all of Scripture Wow
[1:43:24] that's pretty powerful isn't it church
[1:43:27] John's crying like oh we're a sentence
[1:43:30] gonna rule over us and he's gonna have
[1:43:32] the Rees gonna be god of this world
[1:43:33] forever if nobody takes that book we're
[1:43:35] never gonna come to our full maturity
[1:43:37] everything's lost it's all just been a
[1:43:38] waste he's weeping and all of a sudden
[1:43:40] he sees Jesus and this is the most
[1:43:43] sublime thing in all the Bible Oh
[1:43:47] hallelujah
[1:43:48] he says God's law required he's the one
[1:43:51] that holds it God's law required a
[1:43:54] kinsman redeemer and the lamb come out
[1:43:56] boldly so now he walks out boldly like a
[1:43:59] lion and a lamb and Jesus said I am
[1:44:04] their kinsman I am their Redeemer I now
[1:44:06] made intercession for them and now I've
[1:44:09] come to claim their rights for them he
[1:44:10] said amen amen
[1:44:11] I come to claim their rights in that
[1:44:14] they have a right to everything that
[1:44:16] lost in the fall and I paid the price
[1:44:20] he said old brother woo don't it make
[1:44:23] you feel religious not by good words
[1:44:26] which we have done but by His mercy oh
[1:44:29] wait a minute
[1:44:30] and then elders and everything else
[1:44:32] began to throw out their crowns that
[1:44:33] didn't it tears begin to get on the
[1:44:35] ground
[1:44:36] amen this was such a beautiful moment
[1:44:39] that they followed their faces and they
[1:44:41] throw their crowns down this was so
[1:44:43] sublime this was so beautiful if no one
[1:44:47] takes this book we're all gonna be under
[1:44:48] Satan's Dominion we're lost it's all
[1:44:52] been in vain our lives have been in vain
[1:44:54] but when Jesus come and takes the book
[1:44:56] they get so happy they throw their
[1:44:58] crowns out and they fall on their faces
[1:45:00] at the foot of Jesus ah
[1:45:09] now wonder what other scripture we might
[1:45:11] think was pretty sublime I'm sure you
[1:45:14] thought 1st Thessalonians 4 was pretty
[1:45:16] sublime about the rapture the shout
[1:45:18] voice Trump
[1:45:18] how many thought that was sublime well
[1:45:22] brother have said revelation 5 is the
[1:45:25] most sublime scripture no one no one can
[1:45:29] do it and he walks right up to the right
[1:45:31] hand of God and the book out of his
[1:45:33] right hand and claim his rights here's
[1:45:35] here's the one I want to read Jesus when
[1:45:37] he does he's saying I have died for
[1:45:40] Bride of Christ fellowship I am their
[1:45:43] kinsman redeemer I am the mediator my
[1:45:48] blood was shed I have become a man and I
[1:45:52] did this in order to get that church
[1:45:54] back again the word I Forrest's foresaw
[1:45:57] before the foundation ward I purposed it
[1:46:00] I spoke that it would be there and
[1:46:02] nobody was able to take it but I went
[1:46:06] down and done it myself
[1:46:07] I am their kinsman I become their
[1:46:10] kinfolks
[1:46:13] this is the most sublime thing in
[1:46:15] scripture because brother bran doesn't
[1:46:18] get credit for salvation Elijah doesn't
[1:46:20] get credit for salvation Mary the Virgin
[1:46:23] doesn't get credit for salvation no one
[1:46:26] can get any help no one getting credit
[1:46:28] all the credit falls on our Lord Jesus
[1:46:31] Christ
[1:46:31] no one can glory in God's presence
[1:46:34] that's why this is the most sublime
[1:46:36] there's only one conquer there's only
[1:46:39] one I am Amen
[1:46:42] sublime means lofty if you look it up in
[1:46:46] Merriman's Webster's lofty grand exalted
[1:46:51] tending to inspire awe so maybe by the
[1:46:55] end of this some of your jaws will drop
[1:46:57] open and you like this done preaching
[1:47:03] well if it's the most sublime thing in
[1:47:05] scripture I might expect somebody to be
[1:47:06] that look like that no I'm just joking
[1:47:10] you understand what I'm saying but if we
[1:47:12] really think about this church john was
[1:47:14] a spirit-filled man he's weeping because
[1:47:17] no one could take this book
[1:47:18] there were such promises there was such
[1:47:21] power within that book the power of the
[1:47:24] the word in that book if no one took it
[1:47:27] they'd be lost forever
[1:47:28] we never get back to what Adam was in
[1:47:31] the Garden of Eden supreme transcendent
[1:47:37] excellent so just beyond excellent
[1:47:40] here's excellent and this sublime is
[1:47:42] beyond excellent Oh who's waiting for me
[1:47:46] tonight
[1:47:48] who is that one church that's waiting
[1:47:51] there what else could wait there for you
[1:47:53] but that can fin Redeemer oh my what a
[1:47:56] sublime statement or act I better stop
[1:48:01] right there on a stay on our feet
[1:48:02] I'm just preach till ten o'clock tonight
[1:48:04] I better stop I appreciate this bard but
[1:48:08] I stand to our feet by God's good I'll
[1:48:09] have to appreciate next time maybe next
[1:48:11] into Wednesdays we'll see by God's grace
[1:48:14] you love the Lord tonight why is this so
[1:48:20] symbolize revelation five so sublime
[1:48:22] because it proves all of our
[1:48:26] righteousness is as filthy rags there's
[1:48:30] only one who is truly righteous there's
[1:48:35] only one who's a real mighty Conqueror
[1:48:37] you know we we hear it all the time well
[1:48:39] we're the bride or we're the bride or
[1:48:40] you're a mature god I even said that and
[1:48:42] that's true but you and I could not do
[1:48:45] that without Jesus Christ we must
[1:48:48] remember where all the blessings come
[1:48:50] from
[1:48:50] we must if our if we get hit on the
[1:48:53] Apple dropping underneath the apple tree
[1:48:55] like a man tells that story about the
[1:48:56] pig he doesn't even look up but if we
[1:48:58] get hit with the blessing of God we need
[1:49:00] to look up and say thank you we need to
[1:49:02] be that leper that one that tithe of the
[1:49:04] leper the one-tenth of the leper we need
[1:49:07] to be the one Oh Lord look what you've
[1:49:08] done I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna
[1:49:10] thank the Lord for all that he's done
[1:49:12] for me because I could not have this
[1:49:14] without the grace of my Lord Jesus
[1:49:16] Christ hallelujah the most sublime thing
[1:49:21] the most excellent thing in scripture is
[1:49:23] Jesus taking the book and now he can
[1:49:27] give back to us what Adam lost for all
[1:49:30] these 6,000 years oh don't you love
