[38:34] it's over now he's alive and well
[38:38] and uh he's proven in all of our lives
[38:40] and
[38:42] he's exactly what he said he was and
[38:45] he's going to fulfill
[38:46] everything he promised as i heard
[38:49] long ago uh in the uh maybe
[38:53] communist countries uh they would have
[38:55] checkpoints for
[38:56] people visiting and church was illegal
[38:58] back then or at that time
[39:01] and a lady was heading to a underground
[39:03] service and
[39:05] the guard asked her where are you going
[39:06] she goes i'm
[39:08] heading to hear about it to see what's

[39:36] yeah i'll take that absolutely
[39:40] and i have not seen we have heard what
[39:42] good things he has prepared for those
[39:44] that
[39:44] love him how much do we love him today
[39:47] we appreciate him holy good seeing all
[39:49] the saints
[39:49] faithful warriors and precious soldiers
[39:52] singers
[39:52] man i heard some children out here
[39:54] tearing it up brother ape uh brother
[39:56] jose was there a wonderful song special
[39:59] video and all them singing their hearts
[40:01] out praise the lord so
[40:03] uh let's uh get right into the word here
[40:05] today um
[40:07] i wanna as always i i just kind of teach
[40:10] and
[40:11] uh and saints said
[40:15] one thing i you know in the when you're
[40:17] battling
[40:19] in the word when you're going sword
[40:22] versus sword iron versus
[40:24] iron as it sharpens one another um
[40:27] as you know there's uh
[40:30] some that i would say like this not only
[40:32] have left the message
[40:34] uh in that sense but left the doctrine
[40:38] and as uh i've kind of went back and
[40:41] forth
[40:42] and back and forth and i'll tell you
[40:44] what saints the lord's opened up some
[40:45] tremendous
[40:49] and revelations to me uh
[40:52] i was battling a little bit there on a
[40:54] certain topic and
[40:55] and i think to god maybe lord willing
[40:57] i'll teach this next time but i
[40:58] understand
[41:00] i really believe i understand
[41:05] uh the taking of the book
[41:09] what was that the breach i really
[41:12] believe i understand why that breach had
[41:14] to happen
[41:16] that day
[41:20] when the seals were opened and the lamb
[41:22] came and took that book
[41:23] and it was revealed i really believe i
[41:25] think we've got a grasp on it by god's
[41:27] grace maybe we'll teach that next time
[41:29] um but i'm going to continue on to
[41:32] something lord willing that
[41:35] i've been ministering on for a while
[41:36] even at home and i've shared quite a few
[41:38] here but
[41:39] greater understanding this is i'm
[41:41] actually going to reteach something i
[41:42] thought probably six or seven years ago
[41:44] but now i have a greater understanding
[41:46] of a real what we're dealing with here
[41:48] you know what why is
[41:49] the way things they are and i like to
[41:52] have
[41:52] more knowledge and just a true
[41:54] understanding because if you have a true
[41:55] understanding of something
[41:56] you can actually explain it simply amen
[41:59] and you can actually
[42:00] tell someone about it and witness and
[42:03] and you can have confidence because you
[42:04] have a
[42:04] full revelation of it um
[42:09] anyhow let's start in genesis 12.
[42:15] i don't want to keep you guys holding
[42:16] too long we have two poor passions the
[42:18] scripture about this long
[42:19] i will go on the next one here shortly
[42:21] and uh genesis 12 verse 1
[42:24] through 7 it says and the lord said unto
[42:27] abram
[42:28] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[42:30] kindred and from thy father's house
[42:32] unto a land that i was shooting and i'll
[42:34] make of thee a great nation and i'll
[42:36] bless thee
[42:37] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[42:39] be a blessing
[42:40] we only be blessings here to others
[42:44] it's nice to be blessed but when you
[42:45] bless someone else saints of god that'll
[42:47] go eternal
[42:50] and i'll bless them the blessing and
[42:52] curse him that curses thee
[42:54] and in thee shall all families of the
[42:55] earth be blessed so abram departed as
[42:59] the lord had spoken unto him
[43:00] and lot went with him and abram was 75
[43:04] years old when he departed of
[43:05] iran and abram took sarai his wife
[43:09] and lot his brother's son and all their
[43:11] substance that they had gathered and the
[43:12] souls that they had gotten in haran
[43:15] or haran how we gonna say it and they
[43:17] went forth into the land of
[43:19] canaan into the land of canaan they came
[43:23] and abram passed through the land and
[43:25] the place of
[43:26] sichuan citrum under the plain of moray
[43:30] unto the
[43:31] and the canaanite was then in the land
[43:34] and the lord appeared
[43:36] unto abram and said unto thy seed will i
[43:39] give this land
[43:40] and there he builded he an altar
[43:43] unto the lord who appeared unto him
[43:46] let's read one more passage of scripture
[43:48] in mark 12.
[43:52] i kind of want to jump there
[43:57] god bless your souls for traveling this
[43:59] far i know we got some
[44:01] very long drivers here and of course the
[44:03] the very close
[44:04] uh soldiers that uh god bless you all
[44:07] this morning we
[44:12] see mark 12 verse one
[44:23] and he began to speak unto them by
[44:24] parables a certain man
[44:26] planted a vineyard and set a hedge about
[44:28] it and build it
[44:29] and dig the place for the wine fat and
[44:31] build a tower and set it
[44:33] out and let it out to husbandman
[44:36] and went into a far country and as the
[44:39] season
[44:40] and at the season he sent to the
[44:41] husbandman a servant that he had
[44:43] might receive from the husband of the
[44:44] fruit of the vineyard
[44:46] and they caught him and beat him and
[44:48] sent him away empty
[44:51] and again he sent unto them another
[44:52] servant and and at him
[44:55] they cast stones and wounded him in the
[44:57] head and sent him away
[44:58] shamefully handled and again he sent
[45:00] another and him they killed and many
[45:03] others
[45:04] some beating and killing some
[45:07] having yet therefore one son his beloved
[45:10] he sent him
[45:12] also last on him saying they will
[45:14] reverence
[45:15] my son but those husbands
[45:18] said among themselves this is the heir
[45:20] come let us kill him
[45:21] and the inheritance shall be ours
[45:24] so they took him and killed him and cast
[45:26] them out of the vineyard
[45:28] what shall therefore the lord the
[45:30] vineyard do
[45:32] he will come and destroy the husband and
[45:34] give the vineyard unto
[45:36] others so let's say a word of prayer
[45:41] dearly father lord jesus lord you know

[46:37] so one thing you know when you there's
[46:40] within the the framework of the church
[46:41] you know we know there's two spirits
[46:43] there's the
[46:44] true and the faults the spirit of god
[46:46] and the spirit of the antichrist
[46:48] and what are they warring for they're
[46:50] warring for the bride
[46:52] right they're this and though they're
[46:54] the people stand up here this could be
[46:56] the
[46:56] the clergy or those fivefold ministries
[46:58] and then there's the laity but remember
[47:01] everything that is revealed to a a a a
[47:04] five-fold
[47:05] is actually given to you it's for this
[47:08] for
[47:08] you to feast on us for you to understand
[47:11] it's for you to grasp
[47:13] this is this we're in a way we're just
[47:16] chefs
[47:17] we're just chefs the food comes in here
[47:19] it's it's come
[47:20] at a lot of times at night the guy the
[47:23] semi guy drives in there you know and
[47:25] he's unloading and
[47:26] and then the guy's receiving the back
[47:27] and they're just separating this and
[47:29] this and sorting it business
[47:30] and then they wake up early in the
[47:32] morning some of them not necessarily me
[47:34] i'm more of those late night guys that
[47:36] prepares the food before the day before
[47:40] and then the chef will get it you know
[47:41] he'll make it a certain way just have it
[47:43] on the pots bowling and as soon as that
[47:44] store is open
[47:45] or that business is open then the
[47:47] customer sees everything is for
[47:49] you and what's it supposed to do for you
[47:52] i just saw
[47:52] a brother cam just showed me a
[47:53] tremendous quote last night he said
[47:57] the laity is in control
[48:01] you control everything he said the
[48:03] pastor's the head
[48:04] he says but the laity is in control of
[48:07] everything or supposed to be if there is
[48:10] a problem
[48:11] in this church in the laity the laity
[48:13] should deal with it
[48:15] should start calling it out and confront
[48:17] the person or confront this this
[48:19] or this or this and sort it without
[48:21] within themselves though the past to be
[48:23] the head and the pastor may want to
[48:24] oversee
[48:25] the saints of god you are the keepers
[48:29] yes absolutely i thought i'd share that
[48:31] because to me that's tremendous
[48:33] we have to that's why that's why who
[48:35] keeps this church clean than
[48:36] the nine spiritual gifts what from the
[48:39] from
[48:40] the laity we're supposed to get in the
[48:43] in the spirit and speak in tongues and
[48:45] then someone's supposed to interpret
[48:47] and call out this and call out that and
[48:49] get everything just right
[48:52] absolutely it's a it's a high we we've
[48:54] got to really come into this because
[48:56] remember
[48:56] program said over and over again he said
[48:58] the local
[48:59] assembly would have the local body would
[49:02] have these nine spiritual gifts
[49:04] does our church have them no but saints
[49:06] of god we desire them we're hungering
[49:09] and thirsting
[49:10] after those things absolutely so anyhow
[49:13] we want to get into this study um
[49:17] and saints of god is we got to pray for
[49:19] my nephew last night and
[49:20] got to share on baptism we got to share
[49:23] on
[49:24] being filled with the holy ghost we got
[49:25] to got to share between
[49:27] father and son i had them in the room
[49:29] just them guys and we got to share about
[49:31] baptism
[49:32] wise and foolish virgin saints of god it
[49:35] is coming down and
[49:35] who cares about next football season st
[49:37] is gone we might
[49:38] our money might be nothing let me let me
[49:41] tell you like this
[49:42] i'm building an apartment right now for
[49:44] somebody
[49:46] and what are the uh what two two and a
[49:48] half dollars could buy
[49:49] a year ago won't even buy two of it or
[49:53] or or or one of them even today a piece
[49:55] of lumber or two by four by eight
[49:57] is 750 right now seven dollars and fifty
[50:00] cents
[50:01] it was two dollars or less a year and a
[50:03] half ago
[50:05] in some spots what does that mean our
[50:07] money has
[50:08] lost one two thirds of its value almost
[50:14] it let's let's just be real real
[50:18] we can't it's coming exact everything
[50:21] that prophet said
[50:22] is coming and we're seeing it you know
[50:25] it's in our faces right now and yet our
[50:28] even be but the effects of the world and
[50:30] how stall our dolled our senses and
[50:32] we just really haven't really woken up
[50:34] yet to it to where we're praying all
[50:36] night and witnessing and
[50:37] we're living to the lord and doing
[50:38] everything we can for the kingdom
[50:40] anyhow i just wanted to share that and
[50:43] because i'm seeing it as i'm building
[50:44] and how much money i'm spending i'm
[50:45] spending
[50:46] two or three times more than what i
[50:47] thought i would have to spend it was
[50:49] costing
[50:50] the lord allowed that and it's something
[50:51] you just i just have to do because i'm
[50:53] in that
[50:54] the lord allowed him so here's what i'm
[50:56] going to teach down here by
[50:57] the great gods of grace we're going to
[51:00] continue on the trail of the serpent
[51:03] and uh with the sub-topic of
[51:07] war on the meek so we want to get into
[51:10] this by god's grace
[51:11] uh trail of the serpent what is what is
[51:14] why why
[51:15] what's coming down here uh we know how
[51:17] the nicolaitans come in we know all that
[51:19] from
[51:19] 2000 years ago we know we're working
[51:22] those things but uh
[51:23] i want to kind of hit a certain thing
[51:24] here and you'll see it at the end how
[51:26] clear it is
[51:27] what is what is going on um
[51:31] of course there's many areas that things
[51:32] are going on but i want to hit the
[51:34] specific reason why this is
[51:36] coming so let's let's get into this here
[51:38] now and we read this beginning here in
[51:40] genesis 12
[51:41] 1 here god now appears to abram right
[51:45] and he says he says boy he says if you
[51:47] will pack up he says
[51:48] if you leave mom and daddy if you leave
[51:51] all your family
[51:52] he says i'm going to bless you
[51:54] tremendous and what does he do he brings
[51:56] his nephew along right
[51:58] and that broke the word right there that
[52:00] was so he was not supposed to do that
[52:02] what god came down in vision or spirit
[52:05] form or however and he said
[52:06] he says boy he says i want you and your
[52:08] wife to leave and yet here abraham goes
[52:10] back i'm sure he tells his family says
[52:12] i'm going going
[52:13] and something anoints a lot and says i
[52:15] want to go to
[52:16] and abraham uh unaware he says he allows
[52:19] it and sure enough here he comes and you
[52:20] know the story from there but remember
[52:22] there was a reason for these things sure
[52:25] all our mistakes god is going to make
[52:27] them work out for his good and for his
[52:29] glory absolutely
[52:31] even for your good sure he says
[52:34] so here he says but what's up what's the
[52:36] whole point of this he's calling someone
[52:38] out to receive
[52:39] some land something that god has
[52:42] promised him an inheritance absolutely
[52:44] he's promised him something uh that he's
[52:46] going to give him and abraham
[52:48] sure he says absolutely he says i met
[52:50] god now remember that changed him
[52:53] now when god when god appears to someone
[52:55] or they i was like this
[52:56] even a feeling of the holy ghost they
[52:58] know that god is real absolutely
[53:00] and that there is a spirit there is an
[53:02] invisible person
[53:03] there is an invisible spirit that now is
[53:06] like dwelling within you
[53:07] and you have met him and come face to
[53:09] face and now there's something that
[53:11] in you that knows that this is a real
[53:13] move that this is a
[53:14] real situation that this thing is
[53:17] actually real absolutely
[53:22] he says the lord appeared unto abram and
[53:24] said unto thy seed will i give
[53:26] this land absolutely so now
[53:30] here's the the promise now when mo when
[53:32] abraham went and had his name changed
[53:34] and he traveled here to egypt and back
[53:35] over here and back to egypt and here
[53:37] over there
[53:38] did he receive thy land no but the
[53:40] promise was to
[53:42] him and to his seed absolutely but there
[53:44] has to come a time where he would
[53:46] actually receive it
[53:47] sure uh now as god is now dealing with
[53:50] abraham
[53:51] here before abram he says now he's that
[53:54] god actually prophesies he says he says
[53:56] he says you really
[53:57] aren't going to see this land you've
[53:58] been in this land you've dwelt in this
[53:59] land you actually have
[54:00] you bought a po a portion of this land
[54:04] uh uh from the the sons of hath he says
[54:07] he says he says but your children he
[54:09] says your children great great great
[54:10] great he says they're all he's they're
[54:12] actually going to receive this
[54:14] land he says and they shall afflict them
[54:18] 400 years
[54:19] so here is going to be over 400 year
[54:22] plus
[54:22] going down the line he says but he says
[54:24] but eventually he says your seed will
[54:26] inherit this land sure uh now as we
[54:30] continue on here
[54:32] um in verse 18 he says unto thy seed
[54:34] have i given this land
[54:36] and from the river of egypt unto the
[54:38] great river the river of euphrates
[54:40] absolutely so all these promises of
[54:42] inheritance all these promises of the
[54:44] land
[54:45] sure uh now what kind of land is this
[54:48] here in exodus 3 and 8 he says he says i
[54:51] am come down to deliver them out of the
[54:53] hand
[54:54] of the egyptians and to bring them out
[54:56] of the land unto a good land
[54:58] and a large he says until a land flowing
[55:01] with
[55:01] milk and honey saints of god and thinks
[55:03] about this is the type what
[55:05] what was that land moving they were
[55:07] moving into it was a type of the holy
[55:08] ghost absolutely
[55:10] it was a time of the move of god which
[55:11] is the book of acts absolutely it was
[55:13] it was exactly what god had in his mind
[55:15] naturally
[55:16] which we receive what spiritually sure
[55:19] now
[55:20] but remember as they were to travel this
[55:22] land they had many
[55:24] many battles and saints of god
[55:28] that you god is not going to give you
[55:30] something easy
[55:31] he's going to make you fight for it
[55:34] you have to struggle part of i was like
[55:36] this you meet someone with good
[55:38] character it's because either
[55:39] number one god imparted it or gave them
[55:42] to him
[55:42] or they had to go through many many
[55:46] many trials if you look at the prophet
[55:49] of god he says
[55:50] he says you think this gift's easy he
[55:51] says but if you actually knew what i had
[55:53] to go through
[55:54] he said the kind of life that god makes
[55:56] me live the kind of experiences i have
[55:58] to have
[55:58] the sufferings that i have to have and
[56:01] he's even mentioned over the pulpit
[56:03] a lot of the things that he had to go
[56:04] through he said he wouldn't even
[56:06] speak of them but why it was to mold his
[56:08] character to make it more sincere
[56:11] to more humble i heard a story one time
[56:12] where someone asked sister uh meaty
[56:15] before she passed
[56:16] what kind of man was brother brandon and
[56:18] this is just
[56:19] second hand but i heard that he's that
[56:21] she said that he was the kind of guy
[56:23] that
[56:23] if someone was behind him and he was
[56:25] going down the stairs and they would
[56:26] push him down the stairs
[56:27] and he would fall that he would get up
[56:29] and say are you okay
[56:33] cared nothing for himself
[56:36] he only wanted the divine will of jesus
[56:38] christ
[56:41] and what in that kind of mindset as he's
[56:44] tumbling and maybe taking a tumble here
[56:45] this and god
[56:46] bless him you know in that kind of
[56:48] scenario he would not snap his attack or
[56:50] become injured or whatever
[56:51] he would get up and his mind would be
[56:53] like what was wrong
[56:54] what kind of demon made that man do that
[56:58] and he would be more concerned about
[56:59] what kind of spirit because he know that
[57:01] was not that man
[57:02] man men want to be happy men want to be
[57:05] joyful they want to prosper they want
[57:06] they want
[57:07] they have children and and food and all
[57:09] those they want to be just like everyone
[57:10] else
[57:11] but what made that man do that to me
[57:14] see it's a spirit everything is spirit
[57:16] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[57:18] but by
[57:18] powers and principalities and those sort
[57:20] of things
[57:22] so we have to have the mindset why did
[57:24] that man do that or that sister do
[57:26] that and we know it's a spirit a demonic
[57:29] influence
[57:30] sure absolutely but that's the kind of
[57:32] character we must have in this hour
[57:34] especially in this hour
[57:36] no no not knowing who's who but what
[57:38] that but we know that everyone is
[57:39] influenced by one or two spirits
[57:42] amen and one of the things i heard just
[57:43] brother graham say the other day
[57:46] how do we know what a true christian is
[57:48] now the bible says in
[57:50] mark 16 he says he says these signs
[57:52] shall follow them that are filled
[57:54] the holy ghost no those that believe
[57:57] see because matthew 7 said he said lord
[58:00] lord have we not done this and have we
[58:01] not what they believe the gospel they
[58:03] believe the effects
[58:04] of the preaching of the word and the
[58:06] anointing and
[58:08] they get the same results as the true
[58:12] but jesus said you'll know them by their
[58:14] fruits
[58:17] amen sure
[58:20] absolutely we're going to go we're going
[58:21] to go through that a little bit today as
[58:22] well amen so
[58:24] but now to receive to get it to get this
[58:27] this kingdom i was like
[58:28] to get this land they wanted they had to
[58:30] fight they had to go to war
[58:32] strategy they had to put their life on
[58:35] the line
[58:37] before someone going to battle they they
[58:39] i mean this this is a psychological
[58:40] thing
[58:41] you have to know you this might be your
[58:43] last day
[58:47] i've never been in a battle never been
[58:48] to war i'm not a military man i tried to
[58:50] go in the military the lord shut it down
[58:52] but as i'm as i would imagine someone
[58:54] going out
[58:55] loading their rifle getting their their
[58:57] gear on their arm or this and that
[58:59] they're going out
[59:00] their constant thought says what was it
[59:03] like to taste the steak
[59:04] what was it like to kiss their wife when
[59:06] they left what was it like to do this
[59:07] and this
[59:08] knowing that could be their very last
[59:10] time they ever do it on this side
[59:14] it's real those are real things
[59:19] absolutely and it's just uh i was like
[59:21] this it's just like
[59:22] any other thing it's real life
[59:26] your life is not easy now
[59:30] i want to go into this here by god's
[59:31] grace and hope this
[59:33] will be a blessing notice here in
[59:36] psalms 24 verse 7 he says lift
[59:39] up your heads oh ye gates and be lifted
[59:42] up the everlasting doors and the king of
[59:44] glory
[59:44] shall come in he says who is the king of
[59:48] glory he says
[59:49] the lord strong and mighty the lord
[59:52] mighty in battle right amen god is a
[59:55] soldier
[59:56] jesus christ is a warrior absolutely who
[59:58] is who was
[59:59] the greatest war general ever was jesus
[1:00:02] christ in the flesh
[1:00:03] amen he waged a spiritual war against
[1:00:07] the devil's kingdom
[1:00:08] and he never lost the battle amen
[1:00:12] he never lost the one that was given to
[1:00:15] him absolutely did he lose jesus
[1:00:16] absolutely but judas was what born the
[1:00:18] son of perdition
[1:00:20] he says all for the father's give me he
[1:00:21] says i'll not lose one
[1:00:23] and what he went to battle because this
[1:00:25] is not a natural thing this is a
[1:00:27] spiritual thing saints of god we have to
[1:00:28] want free
[1:00:29] our brothers and sisters who are still
[1:00:32] under bondage
[1:00:33] lord show brother amen where this soul
[1:00:35] this scene is brother bang with this
[1:00:36] scene
[1:00:37] brother john and when this seed is
[1:00:38] absolutely brother jose where are these
[1:00:40] these sisters
[1:00:41] where are the seeds of god that you can
[1:00:43] release that god can use
[1:00:44] you to free amen in this battle this war
[1:00:47] because the
[1:00:47] enemy has strangled the enemy has
[1:00:50] wrapped many of our brothers and sisters
[1:00:52] who we don't even know might not even be
[1:00:53] in this church yet
[1:00:55] that is supposed to be right here and
[1:00:57] god can't do
[1:00:58] nothing until they get right here
[1:01:02] remember everything has to be in place
[1:01:06] when the when the holy ghost came down
[1:01:08] the day of pentecost all hundred and
[1:01:10] twenty had to be in position amen
[1:01:13] i believe you praise me to god amen and
[1:01:15] i believe you're gonna see a move of god
[1:01:17] right here when every person that is
[1:01:20] supposed to be here
[1:01:21] is here amen and now say to god we must
[1:01:24] catch this mentality
[1:01:26] amen we must catch this revelation that
[1:01:28] we have to have our brothers and sisters
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:31] amen we cannot take a rapture with just
[1:01:34] with all of them except one what jesus
[1:01:36] said he's going to leave the 99 just to
[1:01:39] go get that one
[1:01:40] hey man and that's our mentality let's
[1:01:43] say
[1:01:43] i say it like this brother bang may call
[1:01:45] brother uh amen and say brother i need
[1:01:48] this but brother a bang may say brother
[1:01:50] hold on i can't come
[1:01:51] i believe the lord is leading me to this
[1:01:54] man over here
[1:01:55] or to this sister over here and it might
[1:01:57] look like a complete heathen they might
[1:01:59] be they might we must forsake each other
[1:02:01] sometimes amen
[1:02:03] but even though we must take care of
[1:02:05] each other first we got to take care of
[1:02:06] the house of god
[1:02:07] first those in this house absolutely but
[1:02:10] but

[1:04:15] the greatest captains under pharaoh he
[1:04:18] says they're long gone
[1:04:20] all their military knowledge and might
[1:04:23] gone
[1:04:24] and now they're having a jubilee on the
[1:04:26] other side

[1:05:05] as we're dealing with the mighty man of
[1:05:07] war
[1:05:09] i want to show you i taught this
[1:05:10] probably six seven years ago brother
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:12] may remember this i don't know but i
[1:05:14] have a better
[1:05:16] clearer understanding of this i hope
[1:05:17] this is a blessing because
[1:05:21] the revelations lord give me i i like
[1:05:22] him and he gives me certain revelations
[1:05:24] because that's
[1:05:25] that's what i like i don't know i might
[1:05:27] not know about this one but this brother
[1:05:28] can preach that but it might not mean so
[1:05:30] much to me
[1:05:30] or what but he just gives me stuff i
[1:05:32] like you know
[1:05:34] i just hope you like it too sure
[1:05:37] absolutely so here in deuteronomy 20
[1:05:40] he says now here this is a battle
[1:05:43] chapter
[1:05:44] this is a warrior's chapter these are
[1:05:48] laws
[1:05:49] and certain things that can pertain to
[1:05:51] war
[1:05:53] okay oh thank you soldier thank you
[1:05:57] i don't do this story often
[1:06:02] praise the lord thank you he says but
[1:06:05] when thou
[1:06:06] goest out to battle these are specific
[1:06:10] things we must obey these are certain
[1:06:13] things
[1:06:13] and you'll see as we go for those who
[1:06:15] haven't heard this yet you're going to
[1:06:16] see some things right here
[1:06:17] that this to me this is beautiful in
[1:06:20] fact i had to wait i had to do a sunday
[1:06:22] school
[1:06:23] on a sunday morning at like 9 00 a.m and
[1:06:25] i had nothing at midnight and i
[1:06:27] sat there and sat there and i waited and
[1:06:29] waited and i said lord i need something
[1:06:31] to feed your children
[1:06:32] and i waited until two or three in the
[1:06:34] morning and then he dropped this
[1:06:36] sometimes you just got to wait on god
[1:06:38] yeah and i'll see i'm one of those guys
[1:06:39] that the
[1:06:39] the semi comes in it's like two or three
[1:06:41] in the morning and i have to unload it
[1:06:43] and this
[1:06:43] then i get so that that's me it's not no
[1:06:46] no i wouldn't
[1:06:46] i won't go to bed at eight o'clock and
[1:06:48] wake up at two that makes no sense to me
[1:06:49] i'll just stay up and then
[1:06:52] he says when thou goes out to battle
[1:06:54] against thy enemies he says and see his
[1:06:56] horses
[1:06:57] and chariots and people more than thou
[1:06:59] be not afraid of them so the first thing
[1:07:01] in war
[1:07:03] you can't be scared
[1:07:06] you cannot fear the enemy i don't care
[1:07:09] if they have
[1:07:10] 10 different guns and knives and decked
[1:07:13] out and
[1:07:14] everything they're carrying 150 pounds
[1:07:15] is just complete click and destruction
[1:07:18] it doesn't matter don't be scared of
[1:07:19] them i don't care how tall they are
[1:07:21] you can't be scared of trust me i've
[1:07:23] dealt with some big boys
[1:07:24] yeah you can't be scared
[1:07:28] he says and when thou seest horses and
[1:07:31] chariots and a people
[1:07:33] more than thou be not afraid of them for
[1:07:36] the lord thy god is
[1:07:37] with thee which they brought thee up out
[1:07:39] of the land of egypt what he reminds
[1:07:41] them
[1:07:42] remember what i did you had nothing to
[1:07:45] do with this
[1:07:47] god could take all credit he said
[1:07:48] remember what i did yeah i'm still that
[1:07:50] guy that did all that he's i'm still
[1:07:52] with you
[1:07:53] yes sure he says and it shall be when
[1:07:56] thou come as night unto the battle
[1:07:58] and they get real close and you start to
[1:08:01] see
[1:08:02] all the enemy
[1:08:06] that the priest shall approach and speak
[1:08:08] unto the people
[1:08:09] as they as the priests would come notice
[1:08:12] these are not these are not warrior like
[1:08:13] you would think
[1:08:14] but he god actually caused the
[1:08:15] priesthood up before battle
[1:08:18] and the priest would go before him and
[1:08:20] say guys
[1:08:22] see them over there see them see
[1:08:24] everything they got horses chariots you
[1:08:26] see all that
[1:08:28] why because if they're that close to the
[1:08:30] battle the battle is
[1:08:31] certain to happen but the priest must go
[1:08:34] through certain things
[1:08:36] before the battle starts to make sure
[1:08:38] the people are ready
[1:08:41] there are certain things god wanted to
[1:08:43] see take place
[1:08:45] before the battle ensued before you
[1:08:48] put your lives on the line
[1:08:55] and what does he do he reassures them
[1:08:57] number one
[1:09:00] hero israel hero spiritual israel
[1:09:05] you approach this day into battle
[1:09:06] against your enemies
[1:09:08] let not your hearts faint fear not and
[1:09:10] do not tremble
[1:09:12] neither be terrified because of them
[1:09:15] because saying it beforehand is one
[1:09:17] thing but when they see the enemy and
[1:09:19] the great with
[1:09:20] all the fearless and here that may be
[1:09:22] chanting and
[1:09:23] stomping and making the ground rumble
[1:09:26] you could start a fear could start
[1:09:29] making someone scared
[1:09:33] so he has to reassure them
[1:09:36] don't be scared he says for the lord
[1:09:38] your god is he that goeth with you to
[1:09:40] fight
[1:09:41] for you against your enemies to save you
[1:09:46] so he says don't be scared and once he
[1:09:50] sees the people are not scared he has to
[1:09:52] go through three things now we're going
[1:09:53] to see these three things
[1:09:59] and the officer shall speak in people
[1:10:01] saying what man is there
[1:10:03] that hath built a new house and
[1:10:06] hath not dedicated it
[1:10:09] warriors anyone build a house here
[1:10:12] and you have not dedicated your house to
[1:10:14] god
[1:10:17] he says you don't even need to go out
[1:10:18] right now he says let him go and return
[1:10:21] to his house lest he die
[1:10:23] in battle and another dedicate it
[1:10:31] that's one thing
[1:10:34] now i like what gill says
[1:10:38] he says that he has built a new house
[1:10:40] and not dedicated it
[1:10:41] he says it is evident that it was a
[1:10:43] custom in israel to dedicate a new house
[1:10:45] to god with prayer
[1:10:48] he says praise and thanksgiving
[1:10:52] and this was done in order to secure the
[1:10:55] divine presence
[1:10:56] and blessing he says no
[1:10:59] for no pious nor sensible man could
[1:11:02] imagine that he could dwell
[1:11:03] safely in a house that was not under
[1:11:05] immediate protection
[1:11:07] of god real islam our israelites know
[1:11:10] that we
[1:11:10] need god we need jesus christ in our
[1:11:13] house amen
[1:11:14] we need his protection his providence we
[1:11:16] need everything he has amen amen
[1:11:19] so
[1:11:22] at the time of dedication among the jews
[1:11:25] besides prayer
[1:11:26] and praise a feast was made
[1:11:29] to which the relations and neighbors
[1:11:31] were invited something of this custom is
[1:11:33] observed in some parts of our own
[1:11:35] country
[1:11:36] in which it is called the house warming
[1:11:37] and the warming of the house you go
[1:11:39] ahead like let's say someone
[1:11:40] gets married they go get it they get
[1:11:42] together and they rent for a little bit
[1:11:44] and they go buy a house and they say oh
[1:11:45] let's
[1:11:46] come over for a housewarming and just
[1:11:47] celebrate that we have a place to live
[1:11:49] they call around
[1:11:50] [Laughter]
[1:11:51] and the wife will be decorating this and
[1:11:53] decorating that the man's i'm sure
[1:11:55] making sure they have two bathrooms
[1:11:57] running and uh
[1:11:58] do what men do or whatever and just
[1:12:00] maybe sit on the couch when
[1:12:02] so that's what married couple
[1:12:05] yeah something of this custom is
[1:12:08] observed in some parts of the house
[1:12:09] called the
[1:12:10] house warming jesus but in these cases
[1:12:13] the feasting is
[1:12:14] only kept up in what america
[1:12:18] in laodicea come have a housewarming and
[1:12:21] what do they do
[1:12:22] what do we do housewarming we may bring
[1:12:24] presents like oh congratulations brother
[1:12:25] praise god i love
[1:12:26] i love the place absolutely hey man
[1:12:28] praise brown brother that's just i just
[1:12:30] like how you did this and did that and
[1:12:31] then we'll
[1:12:31] be bringing the uh uh a famous dave is
[1:12:34] with steak and barbecue and all those
[1:12:36] things we started eating have a good
[1:12:37] time and we're just all just joking
[1:12:38] around us that
[1:12:39] two or three four five six seven hours
[1:12:41] later then we saw a pirate go home
[1:12:43] and that was the house for me but the
[1:12:47] real way a housewarming is supposed to
[1:12:49] play pray he says
[1:12:50] he says the prayer and the praise is
[1:12:52] forgotten
[1:12:54] thanking god for all that he's done for
[1:12:56] us
[1:12:58] so that the dedication appears to be
[1:13:00] rather more to
[1:13:02] bacchus then to jehovah the author of
[1:13:04] every good
[1:13:06] and perfect gift without praise to the
[1:13:09] lord jesus christ it means
[1:13:10] nothing saints of god in everything we
[1:13:13] do whether in word or indeed must be in
[1:13:15] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:13:18] we must praise him and give him the
[1:13:19] glory and respect
[1:13:21] uh the sincerity the the and just let
[1:13:23] him know how worthy he is and how
[1:13:25] thankful for we saints of god we all
[1:13:28] has anyone missed a meal lately because
[1:13:30] they didn't have any money
[1:13:32] struggling anyone seriously just barely
[1:13:35] i mean it's
[1:13:36] great i mean i think everybody got their
[1:13:39] buying checks
[1:13:40] [Laughter]
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:50] now if he had lately
[1:13:54] built or purchased a new home and has
[1:13:56] not taken possession
[1:13:58] of it not dedicated that made a sound uh
[1:14:01] festival for the entanglement of his
[1:14:02] friends that came to him
[1:14:04] to welcome him to his house let him go
[1:14:07] home and take comfort of that
[1:14:08] which the lord has blessed him with
[1:14:11] remember try it think about this
[1:14:13] um you know how long it took me one i
[1:14:14] built a house it took me a year
[1:14:17] i labored and labored siding
[1:14:20] roofing uh uh plumbing uh uh
[1:14:25] i didn't do the electrical um painting
[1:14:28] finishing work all that flooring
[1:14:30] however we if there's a lot of work into
[1:14:33] it
[1:14:33] imagine a man just finished his house
[1:14:36] and the captain of
[1:14:37] jerusalem or israel says boys we got a
[1:14:40] war
[1:14:41] and the guy's going
[1:14:43] [Laughter]
[1:14:48] i'm tired anyhow where's my sword i
[1:14:50] don't even
[1:14:51] where it's at maybe it's in the attic
[1:14:57] but notice why they tell these guys to
[1:15:00] go back home if they built the house and
[1:15:02] not dedicated it
[1:15:05] he says go take comfort of that which
[1:15:07] god bless and bless him with
[1:15:09] until by enjoying it for some time he
[1:15:11] become less fond of it
[1:15:15] for those who have new vehicles even if
[1:15:16] they're new use which is mostly my
[1:15:18] i've never had a new vehicle i've always
[1:15:20] had new use but when you get that new
[1:15:21] used vehicle
[1:15:23] wow you get in you're like oh it smells
[1:15:25] good in here oh that's clean and
[1:15:27] that's clean and all everything's clean
[1:15:29] and smelly and everything works actually
[1:15:30] you know windows go up and down it don't
[1:15:33] stop here there or you know there's
[1:15:35] cracks here you can hear this thing
[1:15:37] rattling and
[1:15:38] but it's new but give it a month or two
[1:15:41] or a year
[1:15:42] jump in the cars fill the uh i i like
[1:15:45] when i travel i buy those uh
[1:15:47] fritos flavor twists for snacking and
[1:15:50] just today i saw one down in the cracks
[1:15:52] of the scene i'm like
[1:15:54] i might get that later
[1:15:57] but what i'm saying is it gets old it
[1:15:58] gets you get used to it and it doesn't
[1:16:00] become so special
[1:16:02] he says for this he said he says
[1:16:05] and you become less fond of that house
[1:16:07] you just built labor he's
[1:16:08] and consequently less disturbed in the
[1:16:11] war by the thoughts of it
[1:16:12] remember trying to go into battle
[1:16:14] thinking man i want to enjoy my house
[1:16:16] and you're fighting
[1:16:17] and your mind on the house and someone
[1:16:19] comes out and takes you out
[1:16:22] they they god is looking for warriors
[1:16:25] that are sold out housing
[1:16:29] lands don't matter lord where's the
[1:16:32] enemy
[1:16:34] where's my lost brother where's my lost
[1:16:35] sister
[1:16:37] everything in the world is behind them
[1:16:38] they don't care
[1:16:40] lord show me lord help me to do exactly
[1:16:43] what me to do
[1:16:43] oh there's someone demon possessed cast
[1:16:45] them out blah blah blah or however
[1:16:47] someone needs help
[1:16:50] as soldiers we must be done with the
[1:16:53] things of the world
[1:16:56] he says and more willing to lie and
[1:16:58] leave it
[1:17:00] he says for this is the nature of all
[1:17:03] our worldly enjoyment
[1:17:04] that they that they please us best at
[1:17:07] first
[1:17:08] after a while they see the vanity of
[1:17:10] them
[1:17:12] you know that house i labored for you
[1:17:13] for a year after three years i lost that
[1:17:15] thing
[1:17:17] the old uh that housing market crashed
[1:17:20] and i ended up losing it
[1:17:23] you know what i think about houses
[1:17:24] anymore i don't even care about it
[1:17:26] you ever lose ever build a house spend
[1:17:28] an entire year of your life and
[1:17:30] this and energy this this to lose it
[1:17:33] saints of god there is no consider
[1:17:35] continuing city on this earth
[1:17:38] it means nothing anymore
[1:17:41] anything i get i realize this could be
[1:17:43] gone tomorrow
[1:17:46] if it's if it's natural things
[1:17:49] it's just natural it means literally
[1:17:52] nothing fighting over housing fighting
[1:17:56] over land and
[1:17:57] this or this it means nothing
[1:18:02] and you're gonna see why here a little
[1:18:04] bit
[1:18:06] now let's continue on here
[1:18:11] oh i gotta re-up here now
[1:18:14] let's read this here in uh
[1:18:20] in psalm 73 verse one he says a psalm of
[1:18:23] asaph he says truly god is good to
[1:18:26] israel even to such as our of a clean
[1:18:28] heart
[1:18:29] but as for me now notice david was
[1:18:31] struggling
[1:18:33] but as for me my feet were almost gone
[1:18:35] my steps had high well and i slipped
[1:18:38] for i was envious of the foolish when i
[1:18:40] saw the prosperity of the wicked
[1:18:45] saints of god whatever god has given you
[1:18:47] be content
[1:18:48] with it amen
[1:18:51] and as keeping this church clean if a
[1:18:54] brother or sister
[1:18:55] prosper be joyful for them
[1:18:58] within ourselves we want all of us to
[1:19:00] prosper we want
[1:19:01] all of us to be happy to be healthy to
[1:19:04] be strong
[1:19:05] spiritually to be strong naturally yes
[1:19:07] we want it all to prosper amen
[1:19:09] and it might not hit this brother or
[1:19:11] this sister at the same time they might
[1:19:12] come in different seasons
[1:19:13] but whatever season be happy for one
[1:19:16] another
[1:19:17] amen and saints of god as we see our
[1:19:20] spiritual rights
[1:19:22] getting less and less and you know one
[1:19:25] day we're going to have to let go of a
[1:19:26] lot of things very soon
[1:19:28] because what the mark of the beast is
[1:19:30] coming the economical world council of
[1:19:32] churches is coming
[1:19:34] and as we are bound and and band
[1:19:36] together
[1:19:37] and we see the heathen flourishing and
[1:19:40] taking those things and walking right
[1:19:42] into that and regaining housing
[1:19:44] regaining lands regaining
[1:19:46] i was like this jobs and prosperity
[1:19:48] don't you dare
[1:19:50] nbn why because at that time we're going
[1:19:54] somewhere beyond this place
[1:19:58] we are going to we are going we're going
[1:20:00] to receive exactly what our will
[1:20:02] said we would receive we're going to get
[1:20:04] it all we just have to
[1:20:05] suffer for just a brief moment i'm
[1:20:08] telling you saints
[1:20:09] when this stuff comes it's going to be
[1:20:11] so real it'll be
[1:20:12] i i really believe this is going to be
[1:20:15] if we can get that spirit and that stay
[1:20:16] in the atmosphere that it's going to be
[1:20:18] an
[1:20:18] easy walk i'll say it like that
[1:20:21] spiritually
[1:20:22] because we're going to see everything
[1:20:23] that prophet prophesied
[1:20:25] everything malachi 4 said is going to
[1:20:27] happen exactly
[1:20:28] and we're going to say there it is there
[1:20:30] it is there it is praise be to god we
[1:20:32] we are we we see it they don't see it
[1:20:33] but we can see it blessed are our eyes
[1:20:36] and our ears for they see it here amen
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:41] absolutely he's but notice he says david
[1:20:44] said he says
[1:20:45] he says i was starting to slip because i
[1:20:47] what i started letting my heart get
[1:20:49] envious of the heathen making millions
[1:20:51] in the stock market by
[1:20:52] gamestop making millions and
[1:20:57] bitcoin who cares hey that stuff can go
[1:21:00] up and down
[1:21:01] there is nothing stable about bitcoin
[1:21:05] let me tell you if it's not the holy
[1:21:07] ghost it ain't stable amen
[1:21:09] yeah that's right that's right he's the
[1:21:11] only thing stable
[1:21:12] he's the only one that can hold things
[1:21:14] together amen sure
[1:21:16] yes ah let's continue on here
[1:21:19] and david goes on and on and why well
[1:21:22] they got this and they got that and
[1:21:23] he got this and david's like oh man if i
[1:21:25] could no no
[1:21:26] but then he comes to himself
[1:21:31] verse 14 for all the days long jesus i
[1:21:34] was plagued
[1:21:35] i've been plagued and chastened every
[1:21:37] morning he was hunted down by his own
[1:21:38] father-in-law
[1:21:40] hated by his own people he was anointed
[1:21:42] but if i say if i speak thus behold
[1:21:44] i should offend against the generation
[1:21:46] of thy children
[1:21:48] for when i thought to know this it was
[1:21:49] too painful for me just how
[1:21:51] hard his life was and it wasn't hard it
[1:21:53] was absolutely hard
[1:21:56] until and something changed
[1:22:00] until i went into the sanctuary of god
[1:22:04] then i understood their end
[1:22:09] i went into the sanctuary of god
[1:22:13] then i understood
[1:22:16] their end
[1:22:19] let me tell you something about judgment
[1:22:23] how are they brought into desolation as
[1:22:26] in a moment
[1:22:27] god revealed to david that the heathen
[1:22:30] would be destroyed in a moment
[1:22:32] what by coming into the house of god to
[1:22:34] what comes in the house what comes to
[1:22:35] the sanctuary the hearing of the word
[1:22:38] see why i supposed to go to church well
[1:22:40] i'm envious of this and this
[1:22:42] but david had to go to church and hear
[1:22:43] exactly the judgments
[1:22:46] i wonder if david read this scripture
[1:22:48] let me tell you something
[1:22:50] the great tribulation when were those
[1:22:53] judgments set
[1:22:56] all the way back in job
[1:23:03] hashtag went into the trails of the snow
[1:23:05] the treasure of the snow or hashtag
[1:23:06] seeing the treasure of the hail
[1:23:08] he says the treasures of the hail he
[1:23:10] says which i have reserved against the
[1:23:12] time of trouble
[1:23:13] against the day of battle and war
[1:23:15] remember those hailstones are going to
[1:23:16] come down in the book of revelations 100
[1:23:18] 150 pounds each he said god already had
[1:23:20] him set up right here
[1:23:23] god knows the end from the beginning
[1:23:26] when was that flood set when was the
[1:23:28] judgment of the flood set
[1:23:31] as soon as enoch went up
[1:23:35] because then god started looking for one
[1:23:36] more righteous man and he found noah
[1:23:39] and assumed i was like this when did god
[1:23:41] know that noah was
[1:23:43] like this god had the dimensions of the
[1:23:45] ark already done
[1:23:48] and he gave the dimensions of that ark
[1:23:50] to noah
[1:23:51] 120 years before the judgments
[1:23:54] came right before the waters fell
[1:24:00] why because god knew no one else would
[1:24:01] be saved
[1:24:04] here he knows the end from the beginning
[1:24:06] it's already set it's already done
[1:24:10] sure now
[1:24:15] let me say it like this did jesus
[1:24:18] dedicate his house
[1:24:22] if jesus is a mighty warrior did he
[1:24:23] dedicate his house
[1:24:25] because we know in revelations 19 he
[1:24:28] comes to war
[1:24:31] jesus did not get a chance to dedicate
[1:24:32] his house he was murdered
[1:24:37] but here i believe this might be the
[1:24:39] dedication of his house
[1:24:40] before revelations 19.
[1:24:45] and i saw another sign in heaven and
[1:24:48] great and marvelous seven angels having
[1:24:49] the last seven plagues and then them is
[1:24:51] filled up the wrath of god
[1:24:53] and he goes on and on notice in verse 13
[1:24:55] and verse 3 and they shall sing the song
[1:24:57] of moses what was that song of moses
[1:25:00] he had thrown the horse and the horse
[1:25:01] rider into the sea
[1:25:04] and those four horse riders of
[1:25:06] revelations
[1:25:07] and the seals he said he's gonna throw
[1:25:09] those into the sea the lake of
[1:25:10] fire oh hallelujah that's the truth
[1:25:15] they started singing that same song
[1:25:18] again
[1:25:19] he says we shall not fear thee oh lord
[1:25:23] he says
[1:25:23] he says who shall not fear thee oh lord
[1:25:25] and glorify thy name for only thou
[1:25:27] art holy and all nations shall come and
[1:25:29] worship before thee for thy judgments
[1:25:30] are made
[1:25:31] manifest yes he says then after i looked
[1:25:34] and behold the temple of the tabernacle
[1:25:36] the heaven
[1:25:36] testimony in heaven was opened
[1:25:40] and the seven angels came out into the
[1:25:43] temple having seven plagues clothed in
[1:25:45] pure white linen having the breasts gold
[1:25:47] would
[1:25:47] go a breast girdle with golden girdles
[1:25:49] and one of the four beasts came
[1:25:51] unto the seven angels seven golden vials
[1:25:53] for the wrath of god who live for and
[1:25:55] ever
[1:25:55] and the temple was filled with smoke
[1:25:58] from the glory of god
[1:25:59] is this the dedication of the house of
[1:26:02] god
[1:26:03] because remember moses nine months to
[1:26:05] build the tabernacle in the old
[1:26:06] testament
[1:26:07] and at that last nine months they had
[1:26:09] everything in place
[1:26:11] everything was set in the glory of god
[1:26:13] at the dedication
[1:26:15] in the wilderness that temple the glory
[1:26:17] of god came and filled the house amen
[1:26:19] praise be to god
[1:26:20] and the same thing took place in
[1:26:21] solomon's day when david had stored up
[1:26:24] all the wood and stored up all the gold
[1:26:25] stored up all the silver
[1:26:26] and he started and solomon's son took
[1:26:28] over and started building that temple
[1:26:31] and what after they got everything was
[1:26:33] finished everything was set in place
[1:26:35] the glory of god came down once again in
[1:26:37] that temple
[1:26:38] and then what it was dedicated
[1:26:41] but this time the dedication takes place
[1:26:44] his house
[1:26:45] up there takes place yeah
[1:26:50] sure is this it sure let not your heart
[1:26:53] be troubled believe
[1:26:55] it ye believe in god believe also me in
[1:26:58] my father's house are many mansions if
[1:27:00] we're not so i would have i would have
[1:27:01] told you
[1:27:02] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:27:06] he is dedicating your place right now
[1:27:10] and not only that let me say like this
[1:27:12] each one of you is a vessel
[1:27:16] and when you repented
[1:27:19] you were getting you are the priest of
[1:27:21] your tabernacle of your vessel and when
[1:27:23] you repented
[1:27:24] god saw you were getting things in line
[1:27:27] and then he started working and cleaning
[1:27:29] you each up and getting you ready this
[1:27:30] and that and what he see that you were
[1:27:32] the priest of your temple
[1:27:33] but when that holy ghost came down and
[1:27:35] filled your vessel
[1:27:37] and filled your tabernacle and your
[1:27:40] temple what then what he knows right
[1:27:42] then he's dedicated
[1:27:43] you his house now for the all the
[1:27:46] service of the lord
[1:27:47] absolutely that's what the infilling of
[1:27:49] the holy ghost he's dedicating you amen
[1:27:52] sure he's showing that god has that god
[1:27:55] is going to use you
[1:27:57] absolutely amen right here he says he
[1:28:00] has
[1:28:01] uh he also has lively stones or build up
[1:28:03] a spiritual house amen
[1:28:05] a holy priesthood to offer spiritual
[1:28:07] sacrifices praises and glories to god
[1:28:09] holy acceptable lives he says to god by
[1:28:12] jesus christ amen
[1:28:14] here's another dedication the holy ghost
[1:28:17] comes down in this church and what these
[1:28:19] 120 were
[1:28:20] dedicated to god it's over
[1:28:23] finished now
[1:28:27] what's the next thing if a man build a
[1:28:29] house and he is not dedicated he's not
[1:28:31] supposed to go to war
[1:28:34] also and what man is he that
[1:28:37] planted remember the priest is going
[1:28:38] back captains the priests are going back
[1:28:40] and he's looking at the army
[1:28:42] he says he built a house he said you're
[1:28:43] dedicated go back he says if you planted
[1:28:46] a vineyard
[1:28:48] and has not eaten of it yet he says go
[1:28:51] back
[1:28:53] let him also return to his house lest he
[1:28:55] die in battle another man eat
[1:28:56] of it
[1:29:01] and that's absolutely scriptural if a
[1:29:03] man had been at great expense to plant a
[1:29:05] vineyard
[1:29:06] probably much like today ever the prices
[1:29:07] are higher
[1:29:09] inflation's sent in and it's very
[1:29:11] expensive to buy seeds anymore
[1:29:12] and buy them two by four posts and run
[1:29:14] them liars and set up
[1:29:17] he says and long to eat the fruit of it
[1:29:19] which he had for which the first three
[1:29:21] years he was forbidden to do by law
[1:29:24] so a man can plant a vineyard and then
[1:29:27] three years have to wait for it and at
[1:29:28] the end of three years
[1:29:29] we call the war he's like oh grapes and
[1:29:33] and tangelos and uh dragon fruit and
[1:29:37] i don't know what they got in israel but
[1:29:38] all these things definitely not durian
[1:29:40] there's no durian on there i'm sure of
[1:29:41] it
[1:29:43] maybe the queen fruit yes absolutely
[1:29:45] thailand nose
[1:29:46] no durian in that uh vineyard praise god
[1:29:50] he says now notice what was it
[1:29:51] considered he says for forbidden
[1:29:53] uh by law to do it let him alone to let
[1:29:56] him go home
[1:29:57] as if he had mine and gra and gratify
[1:30:00] to his own humor of the fruits of it
[1:30:03] see see how indulgent god is to his
[1:30:06] people in
[1:30:06] innocent things and how far from being a
[1:30:09] hard master
[1:30:12] wait a second god would rather if you
[1:30:14] labored right here
[1:30:15] god would rather you not have you go to
[1:30:17] war
[1:30:18] and you can enjoy the future labor
[1:30:20] instead of go and have a chance to die
[1:30:22] he wants you to enjoy what you've did
[1:30:26] you have to eat of it taste the fruits
[1:30:28] of your labor
[1:30:29] you labored all that and here's a god
[1:30:31] that says no you're not even worthy go
[1:30:33] and put your life on the line no he's
[1:30:34] not even he's that great of a god
[1:30:37] how kind and sweet is that
[1:30:41] because why you're by law by his own
[1:30:44] word you can't even for three years
[1:30:46] and he will not withhold you that fourth
[1:30:48] year
[1:30:50] amen what a wonderful savior we serve
[1:30:53] but now notice what the law says about
[1:30:55] that like i said and when you come into
[1:30:57] the land and have planted all manner of
[1:30:58] trees for food
[1:31:00] then you shall count the fruit thereof
[1:31:02] as uncircumcised
[1:31:05] notice how they put that word in
[1:31:07] uncircumcised
[1:31:08] three years shall it be uncircumcised
[1:31:11] unto you and it shall not be eaten of
[1:31:14] but in the fourth year all the fruit
[1:31:15] there ever shall be holy to praise the
[1:31:17] lord with all
[1:31:20] do you see the scripture in this do you
[1:31:22] see the spiritual moving application of
[1:31:24] this
[1:31:25] i'll say it like this what in type what
[1:31:28] is the vineyard
[1:31:32] jump to it he says and i will he says i
[1:31:34] will lay at waste
[1:31:35] verse six it shall not be pruned nor
[1:31:37] digged and there shall come up briars
[1:31:39] and thorns i will also command the
[1:31:40] clouds they rain
[1:31:42] uh they rain no rain upon it for the
[1:31:44] vineyard of the lord of hosts
[1:31:45] is the house of israel
[1:31:49] jesus christ came to his vineyard he
[1:31:52] planted the vineyard
[1:31:53] and for three and a half years he
[1:31:54] counted as uncircumcised they did they
[1:31:56] were not allowed to have the holy ghost
[1:31:58] [Laughter]
[1:32:02] but remember he died in battle
[1:32:06] he died in battle he never got to eat
[1:32:09] of the fruits of the very vineyard of
[1:32:12] israel that he planted
[1:32:14] now why did he not get to eat the fruits
[1:32:18] we're going to show you a scripture
[1:32:22] here it is christ preaching the exact
[1:32:24] same thing
[1:32:25] and jesus spoke in the parable a certain
[1:32:27] man had a fig tree planted in his
[1:32:29] vineyard
[1:32:30] there we are or israel southeast israel
[1:32:35] in his vineyard and he came and sought
[1:32:36] fruit there and found none
[1:32:38] then he sent her the dresser of his
[1:32:39] vineyard behold these three years i kept
[1:32:41] seeking fruit of this fig tree
[1:32:43] and find none cut it down why cumbersome
[1:32:46] to the ground
[1:32:48] god says i was hungry for it he says but
[1:32:50] there was no fruit on it three years
[1:32:52] he says no fruit he says cut it down but
[1:32:55] notice
[1:32:56] grace came in
[1:32:59] and he and he answered he said to him
[1:33:01] lord let it alone this year also
[1:33:03] till i shall dig about it and dung it
[1:33:05] and if it bear fruit well if not then
[1:33:07] after that we shall cut it down
[1:33:09] what'd they do god send in titus
[1:33:13] or nero however in 70 a.d and cut down
[1:33:15] that tree
[1:33:17] but christ has still not eaten of the
[1:33:19] fruit
[1:33:21] of the vineyard here's another thing as
[1:33:24] they would go back these ministers going
[1:33:26] back before the warriors before the camp
[1:33:28] he says if you take a house and you
[1:33:30] didn't dedicate it go back
[1:33:31] if you planted a vineyard for three
[1:33:33] years they have not eaten it head back
[1:33:35] then he says if you if there is a man
[1:33:37] that betrothed a wife
[1:33:39] and not not taken her
[1:33:43] let him go and return into his house
[1:33:45] lest he die in battle and another man
[1:33:47] take her so this man has a wife
[1:33:52] if a man's engaged to be married and
[1:33:56] he has not taken her he's not supposed
[1:33:59] to
[1:34:00] go to war
[1:34:05] and when a man taking a new wife he
[1:34:06] shall not go the war neither be charged
[1:34:08] with any business but he shall be
[1:34:10] free at whole one year and shall cheer
[1:34:12] up his wife which she has taken
[1:34:17] why does the rapture take place before
[1:34:19] revelations 19.
[1:34:20] [Laughter]
[1:34:26] one year jesus i'm taking three and a
[1:34:28] half years
[1:34:29] we're gonna have a wedding suffer for
[1:34:31] three and a half years am i praising
[1:34:33] god i didn't get you two thousand years
[1:34:35] ago he said but let me tell you
[1:34:36] something for three
[1:34:37] and a half years we're gonna eat and
[1:34:39] dying and worship and praise
[1:34:41] you're gonna praise me and you're gonna
[1:34:43] serve me man we're gonna have a glorious
[1:34:45] time up there
[1:34:47] he will get his wife
[1:34:50] but notice look what took place
[1:34:55] christ died in battle before he could
[1:34:57] actually go to war
[1:34:59] he was leading up to the great
[1:35:00] consummation of taking the entire place
[1:35:03] if christ would have not been killed he
[1:35:04] would have took it over
[1:35:07] why do you think we have to be taking
[1:35:08] the rapture because that bride
[1:35:10] knows what's hers and she would
[1:35:13] completely take this place over
[1:35:16] but that's not part of the plan these
[1:35:18] heathen have been heated so much
[1:35:20] and the cup of iniquity is so full that
[1:35:22] what god says boy it says
[1:35:23] he said woman he said come on now up
[1:35:25] here he says he says we're not we're not
[1:35:27] we're not fighting yet
[1:35:28] let i want to i want to judge these
[1:35:30] people first
[1:35:32] then i'm going to give you a house then
[1:35:35] i'm going to give you this
[1:35:37] but notice for i am jealous over you
[1:35:40] with the godly jealousy for i have
[1:35:41] espoused you to one husband then i
[1:35:42] may present you as a chaste virgin to
[1:35:44] christ
[1:35:48] but i fear lest by any means
[1:35:52] he says as the serpent begotten eve
[1:35:54] through subtility notice christ
[1:35:56] came and left the virgin paul espoused a
[1:35:59] virgin to christ but what took place
[1:36:03] she was defiled is that scriptural
[1:36:08] absolutely deuteronomy 22 25
[1:36:12] if a man be find and betroth dams on the
[1:36:15] field
[1:36:15] the field is the world
[1:36:18] if a man finds someone else's betrothed
[1:36:22] someone's else's uh a bestowed wife
[1:36:25] someone else's
[1:36:26] uh engaged with their wedding ring and
[1:36:28] everything on
[1:36:30] in the world and the man of forcer the
[1:36:33] god of force
[1:36:36] and lie with her defile her morally
[1:36:39] spiritually then the man only that lie
[1:36:42] with her shall die
[1:36:44] she doesn't die no
[1:36:47] why but the damsel thou shalt do nothing
[1:36:50] praise be to god
[1:36:52] and we can thank our forefathers now
[1:36:55] notice
[1:36:56] for as when a man rises up against his
[1:36:58] neighbor and slayeth him even so is this
[1:37:01] matter
[1:37:02] oh this man is a fuller wrath his
[1:37:04] husband he said you mess with my wife
[1:37:05] you're a dead man
[1:37:07] off with his head oh throw him in the
[1:37:09] lake of fire sure
[1:37:10] he says notices for he found her in the
[1:37:13] field and
[1:37:14] the betrothed damsel cried and there was
[1:37:17] none to save her
[1:37:20] did that first church age cry out the
[1:37:23] apostle paul said
[1:37:25] for three and a half years i warned you
[1:37:27] with tears
[1:37:29] and crying he says there's grievous
[1:37:31] wolves coming
[1:37:33] there's nicolaitans there's things
[1:37:35] they're going to do deeds are going to
[1:37:36] do to defile you
[1:37:38] and i've cried that lady would have
[1:37:39] taught and have taught i preached and i
[1:37:41] preached and they're coming and they're
[1:37:42] coming i'm telling you
[1:37:44] and paul went off the scene and sure
[1:37:45] enough they come in and defiled
[1:37:48] the very church to god had started
[1:37:52] they defiled christ's wife
[1:37:59] did she scream out absolutely in fact
[1:38:02] jesus said he heard her screams
[1:38:05] let me show you nevertheless i have
[1:38:08] somewhat against me christ's
[1:38:10] own words because thou has left thy
[1:38:12] first love
[1:38:13] why because someone came and defiled her
[1:38:17] remember therefore from thence thou art
[1:38:18] fall and repent and do the first works
[1:38:19] outside would come quickly and remove
[1:38:20] that cancer god's place except that
[1:38:22] repent
[1:38:22] he says but this thou has that thou
[1:38:24] hatest the deeds of the nicolaitan amen
[1:38:27] they they god heard they said we don't
[1:38:29] like the way you're doing this and we
[1:38:30] don't like to do that but there were so
[1:38:31] many of them they overcame them
[1:38:34] but god heard their voice and said we i
[1:38:37] know you hate the deeds he says and so
[1:38:39] do i
[1:38:41] he said they tried the apostles and they
[1:38:43] were apostles and he found out they were
[1:38:44] liars
[1:38:46] saints of god that early bride did their
[1:38:48] best
[1:38:49] and they called them out and called them
[1:38:51] out and called them out until what
[1:38:52] they finally and what god allowed it
[1:38:56] he was off the scene he had died in
[1:38:59] battle
[1:39:01] but now why did i was like this why did
[1:39:05] the
[1:39:06] bride get the file notice notice this
[1:39:08] scripture right this is beautiful
[1:39:10] everything in the bible is perfect
[1:39:11] deuteronomy 18 15
[1:39:13] and it shall come to pass but thou shalt
[1:39:14] not hearken if thou
[1:39:16] are not hearken to the voice of the lord
[1:39:17] thy god to observe to do all his
[1:39:19] commandments and his statutes which i
[1:39:21] command these days
[1:39:22] that all these curses shall come upon
[1:39:24] thee and overtake thee
[1:39:30] what was one of the curses verse 30 thou
[1:39:32] shalt betroth a wife and another man
[1:39:34] shall lie with her
[1:39:37] thou shalt build the house and shall not
[1:39:38] dwell around
[1:39:40] now shall plant a vineyard and thou
[1:39:42] shall not and not gather the grapes
[1:39:43] throughout have christ done any of this
[1:39:45] yet
[1:39:46] no he was killed but he had planted a
[1:39:48] wife
[1:39:49] he had planted a vineyard and he was
[1:39:51] trying to prepare a house to get his
[1:39:52] house ready but he died
[1:39:56] and now this has taken taken him by
[1:39:59] storm right because what he was
[1:40:01] made a curse
[1:40:04] god that's why everything in the church
[1:40:07] ages happened the way it happened
[1:40:08] because christ became a he took all our
[1:40:11] curse of disobedience
[1:40:13] and when he took that on he knew he
[1:40:15] would lose his wife
[1:40:16] he knew he would not be able to finish
[1:40:18] his house and then he would not that he
[1:40:20] would not be taken of the fruits of the
[1:40:21] vineyard
[1:40:24] but we're not dealing with the normal
[1:40:26] man
[1:40:26] [Laughter]
[1:40:28] chase of god when you're dealing with
[1:40:30] the law you're dealing with god
[1:40:32] god does as he please i can come back to
[1:40:34] life again and take exactly
[1:40:36] what i lost praise you to god amen yes
[1:40:39] oh you know it's the truth
[1:40:43] you're not dealing with a mortal man
[1:40:47] even that very body of jesus christ that
[1:40:50] died and bled and rose again that same
[1:40:52] body
[1:40:53] is still alive on the throne amen
[1:40:56] but the greatest slap in the face is
[1:40:58] that he's waited this
[1:40:59] long to let the devil get what he
[1:41:01] deserved
[1:41:02] even he did not punish cain right away
[1:41:06] he did not punish satan right away
[1:41:10] god is a god of grace
[1:41:13] and mercy now brother why did you go
[1:41:16] through all that because i'm going to
[1:41:17] tell you why this is going on
[1:41:23] what is coming why are these tr why are
[1:41:26] these
[1:41:27] transgender people all like that there
[1:41:29] is a group
[1:41:30] select small group of people who who now
[1:41:34] whether they're more male where they're
[1:41:36] born female
[1:41:37] now within them is this feeling that
[1:41:40] they
[1:41:41] want their bodies changed
[1:41:44] what is that that is the anointing of
[1:41:47] the rapture
[1:41:48] scriptures the bible says
[1:41:51] behold i said that show you a mystery we
[1:41:53] shall not all die but we shall be
[1:41:55] changed we are promised
[1:41:58] a body change and it shows that that
[1:42:02] scripture is
[1:42:03] very anointing all that word is is
[1:42:06] hovered for
[1:42:07] thousands and thousands of years in this
[1:42:09] this area this arena as that word was
[1:42:11] spoken by paul
[1:42:13] as it was spoken by christ the anointing
[1:42:15] of it now is very close to come that's
[1:42:17] why we know we're at the point of the
[1:42:18] rapture
[1:42:19] because even the heathen are wanting a
[1:42:22] body change
[1:42:25] but notice the anointing that striking
[1:42:28] them is also striking us
[1:42:30] we want a body change but because the
[1:42:32] anointing is affecting
[1:42:34] the wrong vessel
[1:42:38] remember there's two kinds of people on
[1:42:40] the face of the earth there are
[1:42:42] in romans romans 9 there are vessels
[1:42:45] prepared for destruction
[1:42:46] and vessels prepared for glory two
[1:42:49] separate
[1:42:49] vessels and that anointing strikes both
[1:42:52] and it affects both differently why
[1:42:56] because one's carnal
[1:42:57] and the other one's spiritual
[1:42:58] [Laughter]
[1:43:01] yeah why is there i was like this we
[1:43:04] live in the world
[1:43:05] i see spider-man this and batman that
[1:43:07] and superman
[1:43:09] why are they pushing superheroes so much
[1:43:12] why is that just just coming like super
[1:43:14] people are coming in why
[1:43:16] it's a type of the bride the invincible
[1:43:20] but they say
[1:43:20] they'll be a super natural race
[1:43:25] they are going to be a people who can
[1:43:27] control the weather
[1:43:31] there are people who speak and things
[1:43:34] take place
[1:43:34] there are people who just believe
[1:43:36] something by faith and his strikes
[1:43:40] that lay hands where do all their powers
[1:43:43] come from their hands are shooting this
[1:43:45] or that and they touch things
[1:43:47] by the hands they lay on them and
[1:43:48] they're healed
[1:43:51] thanks to god see the the effects the
[1:43:52] anointing of what's
[1:43:54] everything we're seeing in the world
[1:43:55] think spiritually about it it's the
[1:43:57] anointing of what's ready to strike
[1:44:00] super super super heathens there's a
[1:44:03] real super
[1:44:05] and it's christ in his bride amen
[1:44:08] because all these superheroes got their
[1:44:10] power where's their pop
[1:44:12] our power is the holy ghost
[1:44:14] [Laughter]
[1:44:16] with fire hey man some of them got fired
[1:44:17] we got fire too everybody right here in
[1:44:19] the soul what was cape so same on
[1:44:21] it keeps our feet so praise be to god
[1:44:24] yeah now
[1:44:28] now here's christ revelation 19
[1:44:31] he comes down for war he's already
[1:44:35] now remember this is revelation 19 when
[1:44:36] the rapture takes place
[1:44:38] well what right right around revelations
[1:44:40] before this
[1:44:43] revelation 4 revelations 5
[1:44:46] 4 right there
[1:44:49] where does israel restore revelations
[1:44:51] eleven hundred forty four thousand
[1:44:53] when is this when is house dedicated
[1:44:55] revelation 15
[1:44:57] christ now has fulfilled everything he
[1:44:59] wanted to do now
[1:45:00] he can go to war
[1:45:04] but why is he going to war what
[1:45:07] is the war about he's already got his
[1:45:10] wife
[1:45:12] we're already going to be there saints
[1:45:14] we're going to be up there what's there
[1:45:16] to fight for
[1:45:20] what's this war about brethren
[1:45:25] why are they trying to dial in
[1:45:27] technology
[1:45:29] they literally can hunt down any single
[1:45:31] person and shoot a missile
[1:45:32] from 8 000 miles away and hit the exact
[1:45:35] pinpoint what are they what are they
[1:45:36] prepping for why they want
[1:45:38] this underground facility testing atoms
[1:45:40] they're looking for a power that can
[1:45:42] defeat god
[1:45:44] but what's the war for i'm going to show
[1:45:47] you
[1:45:53] it's about inheritance
[1:45:58] remember they were here first
[1:46:02] adam's feet did not take set on this
[1:46:04] ground
[1:46:05] to genesis 2. but all the animal the
[1:46:09] serpent was here genesis 1. already
[1:46:12] reproducing
[1:46:13] already building shanties already being
[1:46:16] intelligent
[1:46:17] doing things figuring things out and
[1:46:18] doing this and that
[1:46:20] they think it's theirs
[1:46:25] but who gets it
[1:46:29] when god arose to judgment
[1:46:32] to save all the meek
[1:46:35] of the earth you know that's one word
[1:46:38] that god the bible uses as
[1:46:40] the defining or or describing the bride
[1:46:42] as meek
[1:46:47] good and upright is the lord therefore
[1:46:48] he will teach sinners in the way
[1:46:50] the meek will he guide in judgment and
[1:46:53] the meek will he teach his way
[1:46:56] what is meek what is a meek person what
[1:46:58] i mean the bible says that moses was the
[1:47:00] meekest man on the face of the earth
[1:47:03] but what is it what is the definition
[1:47:07] mild of temper
[1:47:12] well brother jose i remember when he
[1:47:19] hey if i do something to hurt your
[1:47:20] feelings please just come talk to me
[1:47:23] i will repent
[1:47:23] [Laughter]
[1:47:26] versailles you're not perfect i know i
[1:47:28] know tell me again i'll tell you i'm not
[1:47:30] again
[1:47:32] you messed up on this i sure did tell me
[1:47:34] one thing i've done good i can't name
[1:47:36] one either
[1:47:38] i'm a complete failure
[1:47:42] as my pastor say captain failure
[1:47:44] [Laughter]
[1:47:47] he says a mild of temper soft
[1:47:52] and gentle lamb sounds lamb or dove
[1:47:56] nature don't you think
[1:47:58] not easily provoked or irritated
[1:48:01] man hanging out with this sister is just
[1:48:04] gets under my skin
[1:48:06] hanging out with his brothers like
[1:48:08] [Laughter]
[1:48:11] as brother graham said what made moses
[1:48:13] so meek that hot temper
[1:48:15] ethiopian wife
[1:48:19] moses you didn't even sacrifice your boy
[1:48:21] i'm sorry not sacrifice but the
[1:48:22] circumciser boy on the eighth day
[1:48:26] she had to do it saved his life
[1:48:30] she was a hot tempered woman and he was
[1:48:33] just like
[1:48:34] how about think of this moses leading
[1:48:38] unconverted people and as the bible says
[1:48:41] our messenger says heathens majority
[1:48:44] were lost
[1:48:46] only two from the original group made it
[1:48:49] moses moses for 40 years he's walking
[1:48:53] i'm thirsty i'm hungry two thousand two
[1:48:56] million people
[1:49:03] lord could you just bring some water
[1:49:06] smack thank you moses thank you most
[1:49:10] thank you moses
[1:49:11] a week later fall on the pole fire
[1:49:14] i'm thirsty i'm hungry

[1:49:23] moe's like oh god
[1:49:27] i'm old man i'm so tired
[1:49:31] [Laughter]
[1:49:34] and that complete that complete
[1:49:40] another drive will drive a man
[1:49:41] completely nuts
[1:49:43] and he did it with he there was so much
[1:49:46] on him that molded him and made him the
[1:49:49] meekest man
[1:49:50] that his father-in-law said you need
[1:49:51] some help get
[1:49:53] 70 helpers moses like
[1:49:58] thank you but after
[1:50:02] 40 years i'm thirsty i'm thirsty and it
[1:50:05] finally brought broke moses and he
[1:50:08] disobeyed the word of god
[1:50:10] and glorified himself because he did not
[1:50:13] speak to the rock he smoted twice
[1:50:17] and yet he was the meat he could take
[1:50:19] two million people
[1:50:21] i didn't hit it no no no
[1:50:25] drove them nuts but it made him me
[1:50:31] not easily they sinned against you lord
[1:50:34] lord jesus blood their mouth that's what
[1:50:37] he says blot me out and not them
[1:50:41] moses was in the presence of almighty
[1:50:43] god for 40 days and 40 nights
[1:50:46] in the presence of god and he could have
[1:50:49] said
[1:50:51] with the glow around his face kill them
[1:50:53] all
[1:50:55] what did he do he was remember he was a
[1:50:58] shepherd for 40 years too
[1:51:00] dumb absolute animals that do not obey
[1:51:13] god was god why do things why does it
[1:51:15] seem like this why does it seem like
[1:51:17] things in your life just don't go like

[1:52:19] and god have mercy on
[1:52:23] all of them and lord if you want to
[1:52:26] block someone out

[1:52:31] in the house of god
[1:52:32] we've been in the sanctuary and we know
[1:52:34] the end of these unbelievers
[1:52:39] you know what it's like not knowing what
[1:52:41] we understand and what we know what was
[1:52:42] revealed to us we don't know what it's
[1:52:44] like
[1:52:44] now we did if we i'd like this i knew
[1:52:47] what it was like well because i was an
[1:52:48] examination we knew nothing
[1:52:50] but i have something to compare it to
[1:52:54] i i i tell you what we are so blessed to
[1:52:57] be right here
[1:52:58] i'm telling you what you we had better
[1:53:01] think back
[1:53:02] think about where we came from
[1:53:05] what do we have now saints even from a
[1:53:07] year ago how much more in the world do
[1:53:09] we understand how much more do we trust
[1:53:10] in god right now
[1:53:12] how much more has he blessed us this
[1:53:13] year than even last year
[1:53:15] he's kept us there are people falling
[1:53:18] away
[1:53:18] and not even believing this word anymore
[1:53:21] and they believe it for 20
[1:53:23] 30 40 years
[1:53:27] don't even believe cain was of the
[1:53:30] servant
[1:53:31] they think cain was of adam's son
[1:53:36] no scripture for it none but only the
[1:53:40] meek
[1:53:41] what does the bible say the meek will
[1:53:43] inherit the earth
[1:53:45] the meek will inherit those that are
[1:53:49] have no temper or mild temper that are
[1:53:51] soft
[1:53:52] and gentle not easily produced yielding
[1:53:55] given to forbearance under injuries he
[1:53:58] hurt me
[1:53:59] praise the lord
[1:54:02] thank god it was me that got hurt and
[1:54:05] not them
[1:54:07] that's who gets the inheritance
[1:54:12] brother that's a tall order just yield
[1:54:15] all you gotta do is like
[1:54:16] lord you're in full control i know it
[1:54:19] well this just happened
[1:54:21] it doesn't matter god's in control it
[1:54:24] doesn't matter

[1:54:27] in your life with
[1:54:28] a certain certain situation whether
[1:54:30] physical financial uh
[1:54:32] a spiritual anything you come up and
[1:54:33] you're like how am i gonna get through

[1:57:56] okay let's let's just jump here
[1:58:00] now look what the brother bran is
[1:58:01] dealing with here is this may they flee
[1:58:03] we have one service thing
[1:58:04] when they flee them denominations of
[1:58:06] greed god way out there and some creeds
[1:58:08] and denominations
[1:58:09] god mercy saints of god
[1:58:12] you know we all feel this we've met some
[1:58:14] of the finest
[1:58:15] brothers and god how i say it when
[1:58:18] they'll see
[1:58:19] i i how can i say when they'll see it
[1:58:21] and let them see the word
[1:58:23] it bothers me me bothers me but i know
[1:58:25] again that you
[1:58:27] said no man can come on come no matter
[1:58:30] how good how meek how gentle
[1:58:32] it must be the meekness of the holy
[1:58:34] ghost the only way you can be meek
[1:58:36] is the holy ghost in you it's not you
[1:58:40] this has god in you it's god in me
[1:58:45] amen take a deep breath and say lord
[1:58:48] come on the scene and you know it's not
[1:58:52] you because i know what i
[1:58:55] unless my father had called him and all
[1:58:56] my father gave me they will come
[1:58:58] and lord i will i feel my soul
[1:59:00] responsibility telling the truth amen
[1:59:02] now let's continue on
[1:59:03] why is this even tied to serpent seed
[1:59:06] let's get there let's just hit it
[1:59:07] think about that blessed are the meek
[1:59:11] for they shall inherit the earth
[1:59:15] all right notice here genesis 1.
[1:59:19] so god created a man his own image and
[1:59:20] image of god created him male 1
[1:59:22] female he blessed them and god blessed
[1:59:24] them he spoke to them
[1:59:26] they heard him and be fruitful
[1:59:30] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[1:59:32] subdue
[1:59:33] it it is yours i give it to you to
[1:59:37] control
[1:59:38] this is your title deeds sermon right
[1:59:41] here
[1:59:42] i'm gonna send you a little bit later
[1:59:43] you're going to be the last one on the
[1:59:44] scene but it's
[1:59:45] yours just like the canaanites we're in
[1:59:48] there before abraham
[1:59:50] but this world is yours now let's
[1:59:53] continue on i'm going to
[1:59:54] run through this there's the wheat and
[1:59:58] tears
[1:59:59] remember good seed bad seed these are
[2:00:01] not good seed
[2:00:02] turned into bad seed there is good seeds
[2:00:05] separate
[2:00:06] and there are bad seeds separate
[2:00:10] people don't don't believe that anymore
[2:00:11] saints saying this
[2:00:18] now notice here in second peter called
[2:00:19] them natural beasts and
[2:00:21] cursed children
[2:00:24] sorry serpent seems cursed they're just
[2:00:25] cursed they can't get away from the
[2:00:27] curse they just curse
[2:00:28] yeah but what's the curse what is the
[2:00:30] curse
[2:00:33] let's look at it what is the curse that
[2:00:36] fell
[2:00:37] on cain
[2:00:40] and the lord god sent the serpent now
[2:00:43] this is an animal
[2:00:44] now he's dealing god is speaking to an
[2:00:46] animal and he curses him what do you say
[2:00:48] he says you're going to be the lowest
[2:00:51] animal because he was an animal
[2:00:54] he said all the animal other animals
[2:00:56] walk above the ground
[2:00:58] on feet they are not on the ground
[2:01:04] so god made the serpent the lowest
[2:01:06] creature
[2:01:08] like this belly face right in the mud
[2:01:12] face eyes everything right in the mud
[2:01:14] right in the dirt right in the dust
[2:01:16] made him the lowest but he's dealing
[2:01:18] with an animal
[2:01:20] and he places him so in the animal
[2:01:22] kingdom
[2:01:26] but when it comes to cain
[2:01:29] it shows that he was now mingled with
[2:01:32] humanity
[2:01:33] look at cain's curse now thou
[2:01:36] art cursed from
[2:01:40] the earth you do
[2:01:43] not even though you came out of eve
[2:01:47] even though now you have a place for a
[2:01:49] soul and you have a soul
[2:01:51] even though you're in the image and
[2:01:52] likeness of god now
[2:01:55] you do not get to inherit the earth
[2:02:02] that was the curse what do you think the
[2:02:05] tribulation is
[2:02:07] what do you think revelation 19 is god
[2:02:10] says fulfilled
[2:02:11] all his things he had to do before he
[2:02:13] goes to battle
[2:02:14] he's going to take his wife he's going
[2:02:16] to restore his house in revelation
[2:02:18] 79 15. he's going to restore the
[2:02:20] vineyard revelation
[2:02:21] 11 and then he's coming to destroy and
[2:02:24] they are what they're going to fight for
[2:02:26] they want this land
[2:02:28] they want the earth it's ours why do you
[2:02:31] think there's a prop why is there title
[2:02:32] deeds or
[2:02:33] property needs for your property because
[2:02:35] it's not yours
[2:02:37] they give you a right to do on that
[2:02:40] property what but it's already theirs
[2:02:43] i believe it's in the 1400s one of the
[2:02:46] popes wrote
[2:02:47] a bull a papa bull and it said the
[2:02:49] catholic church owns the entire world
[2:02:51] they put a curse on it and put it in
[2:02:52] their vaults
[2:02:56] the war is for this this is all they got
[2:02:59] now jesus has
[2:03:00] fulfilled everything he said he's gonna
[2:03:02] do and now they have one they have one
[2:03:03] shot if we can't stop him from getting
[2:03:05] the jews if we can't stop him for
[2:03:07] getting a bride if we can't stop him
[2:03:08] from doing this
[2:03:09] we want the land at least that's what
[2:03:12] it's all about
[2:03:13] that's what this last battle's about
[2:03:15] they want the earth
[2:03:19] they're going to try and take the
[2:03:20] inheritance
[2:03:22] the saints of god thus saith the lord
[2:03:26] it's ours
[2:03:31] amen and the bible says what you will
[2:03:33] plant and you will build another will
[2:03:35] not take anything of it's all yours
[2:03:37] they're not
[2:03:38] saints of god if you want to live on a
[2:03:39] valley if you want to live on a
[2:03:40] mountaintop if you want to live in a
[2:03:41] valley all type of mountain time with a
[2:03:43] river or water or
[2:03:44] pond or hover it's yours and sense of
[2:03:47] god when you plan
[2:03:48] something you're going to eat from it
[2:03:50] everything you do everything you sow you
[2:03:52] will
[2:03:52] reap accordingly it's
[2:03:56] going to be yours so what do we do
[2:03:59] when they come fighting for here shortly
[2:04:03] said if you don't sign up you don't get
[2:04:04] your stuff let it go
[2:04:07] because it's already ours but let's do
