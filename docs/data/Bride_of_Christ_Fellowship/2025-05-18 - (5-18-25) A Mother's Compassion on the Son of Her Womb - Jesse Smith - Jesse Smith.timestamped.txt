[0:00] doesn't even listen to my
[0:01] sermons. Oh, I just love just like when
[0:04] brother Hawkins was here, you know, God
[0:05] just vindicates the word of God.
[0:07] Hallelujah. So thankful for his amazing
[0:09] grace. Isaiah
[0:12] 49:13. So my mother's day sermon is
[0:14] called a mother's compassion on the son
[0:17] of her womb. I thought about sister
[0:19] Naomi having a boy. Praise God.
[0:22] So I didn't get to preach a mother's day
[0:25] message last week, so I'd like to preach
[0:26] that today by God's grace. Isaiah
[0:38] 49:13. Such a lovely text
[0:42] here. And the key word here, of course,
[0:44] is compassion. I thought about mother's
[0:47] compassion. Isaiah 49:13.
[1:00] I'll read 13 and 14 and then uh we can
[1:03] all read 15 by God's
[1:07] grace. Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O
[1:11] earth, and break forth into singing, O
[1:14] mountains, for the Lord hath comforted
[1:17] his people and will have mercy upon his
[1:21] afflicted. Notice, do God's people get
[1:23] afflicted sometimes? Yes. But even in
[1:25] that, God shows
[1:27] mercy. Hallelujah. But Zion said, "The
[1:31] Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
[1:35] forgotten to me. Forgotten me." We've
[1:36] all thought that before, haven't we?
[1:38] Lord, where are you? Haven't you heard
[1:39] my
[1:40] prayers? Right now, let's read 15.
[1:43] Ready? One, two, three. Can a woman
[1:45] forget her suckling child that she
[1:48] should not have compassion on the son of
[1:51] her womb? Yay, they may forget, yet will
[1:55] I not forget thee. Hallelujah. I'm going
[1:59] to read 16. Behold, I have graven thee
[2:02] upon the palms of my hands. Thy walls
[2:06] are continually before me. What a
[2:08] beautiful foreshadowing of the cross of
[2:10] Jesus Christ. 900 years before Jesus
[2:14] died, God said by the Holy Spirit, I'm
[2:16] going to engrave you on the palms of my
[2:18] hands so I never forget about you. Now,
[2:21] we all use our hands all day, every day,
[2:22] don't we? So, God's, we know God's
[2:25] powers in his right hand.
[2:27] Hallelujah. And so, see, God puts that
[2:29] reminder. In other words, God's saying,
[2:30] I'm going to remind myself constantly of
[2:32] you. I will not forsake you. Let's look
[2:36] at verse 17 there. Thy children shall
[2:39] make haste. thy destroyers and they that
[2:42] made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
[2:45] So see God's going to send all your
[2:46] afflictions away because he's merciful.
[2:49] Praise God. Let's have one more word of
[2:50] prayer. If you have anything on your
[2:51] heart, let's make it known to God.
[2:53] Father God, we thank you for today,
[2:54] Lord. Thank you for this opportunity to
[2:55] be in your house. Oh, how I miss being
[2:57] in church, Lord God. It's so awful to
[2:59] miss church, Lord God. So, we're
[3:01] thankful, Lord God, to be here, Lord. I
[3:03] feel the freedom of the Holy Ghost. I
[3:05] feel the liberty of the Holy Ghost. I
[3:07] feel so happy praising your holy name,
[3:09] lifting up my hands, giving you glory.
[3:11] Hallelujah. Thank you for the faith of
[3:13] your people that you've given to us,
[3:14] Lord God. We give you glory today. Be
[3:16] with this sermon, Lord God. May it speak
[3:18] to every heart, Lord God. And we thank
[3:20] you for our mothers, Lord God. It's just
[3:21] another attribute of yours, God. The the
[3:23] love we see in a mother. And God, we're
[3:26] thankful for all your blessings, God.
[3:27] Thank you for, Lord, delivering these
[3:30] babies healthy and one more to go. Lord,
[3:32] we're so thankful, God. You're faithful
[3:33] to the end, Lord. God, you're the alpha
[3:35] and omega, the beginning and the end. So
[3:38] we thank you, Lord God. This is a
[3:39] special time for us in our church and
[3:41] our families, God. So we want to thank
[3:42] you, God. And Lord, bless these mothers
[3:44] in a special way and the fathers, Lord
[3:46] God, as next month will be Father's Day.
[3:48] Uh we traditionally set that side aside
[3:51] that time, Lord, to remember our
[3:53] fathers. So we thank you, Lord, for your
[3:54] love and mercy. Bless us. Uh may we just
[3:56] be obedient to the leadership of the
[3:58] Holy Ghost in Jesus Christ's name. And
[4:00] the church said, "Amen." God bless you.
[4:02] You may be seated. Praise God. Is the
[4:04] live stream on there? Okay. Praise the
[4:05] Lord. So, I want to apologize to our
[4:07] live streamers. We just had a little
[4:08] prayer time before we get uh got started
[4:11] there. But, uh they that wait upon the
[4:14] Lord shall renew their strength.
[4:16] Hallelujah. Sometimes you got to wait a
[4:17] little bit longer.
[4:21] Amen. So, we look at today a mother's
[4:24] compassion on the son of her womb.
[4:26] Praise God. Just a really uh beautiful
[4:28] scripture here. You know this scripture
[4:31] speaks of uh the strongest material
[4:35] bond between humans is the mother and
[4:39] the
[4:40] child. And God God could have chose any
[4:43] bond. He could have chose husband and
[4:44] wife, right? He could have chose any
[4:45] bond, brother and brother. Uh you know
[4:48] even David and Jonathan had such a bond,
[4:50] right? It was so great. But God didn't
[4:51] choose that bond to represent his love.
[4:53] What bond did he choose? The bond
[4:55] between a mother and the child.
[4:57] Hallelujah. And God uses that bond to
[5:01] express even though there's times that
[5:03] bond could fail, my bond with you will
[5:06] never fail. Hallelujah. So God is
[5:09] faithful to remind us church of his deep
[5:11] love. The word compassion means to love
[5:14] deeply. It means tender
[5:17] affection. So God is so uh God has such
[5:20] tender affection for us. Now church,
[5:22] I've been holding a baby for about six
[5:24] straight days. I can't tell you. Brother
[5:26] Vang knows what it's like now. you know,
[5:28] he's got that fresh feeling. I just
[5:29] can't believe what I'm holding in my
[5:30] hands. I'm like, I'm holding a a soul
[5:33] trapped in this body. It's so precious.
[5:36] Every little yawn and every little cry.
[5:39] Now, maybe crying might not be precious
[5:40] to some people, but it's just been such
[5:43] a joy to uh see again the miracle of
[5:46] life. And if I have this bond with a
[5:49] child, how much more does Kristen, how
[5:52] much more does Ca, you know, the mother
[5:54] have with the the child by the grace of
[5:57] God? And remember, as we read in here,
[6:00] God marked Jesus's hands
[6:04] permanently as a sign that he would
[6:07] remember his people. Praise God. And
[6:10] think about that, church. You know, you
[6:11] mothers, you have a child, what happens?
[6:12] Your body's changed forever. Now, you
[6:14] don't have to say amen on that, but in
[6:16] one way or another, your body's changed
[6:19] forever. You're permanently changed,
[6:22] right? Be and we all wish, you know, all
[6:24] the mothers wish they could go back to
[6:25] the way they started. But the reason
[6:29] that doesn't is because God's showing
[6:31] what he did. God uh he scarred his son.
[6:34] Hallelujah. He he had his son crucified.
[6:37] He offered his son's soul as a sacrifice
[6:40] for us. Hallelujah. and gave a permanent
[6:43] reminder that I won't forget you. I'll
[6:46] always love you. Hallelujah. I'm
[6:48] committed to you. Amen. How many
[6:49] thankful God's committed to us? Amen. He
[6:52] gives us a permanent sign. The sign of
[6:54] the old rugged cross. Hallelujah. Jesus
[6:57] took that for us. Now, friends, there's
[6:59] many verses God tells us about that he
[7:02] will not forget us. Of course, we read
[7:04] Isaiah 49.
[7:07] He says, "Yet will I not forget thee."
[7:12] God will not forget you. No matter what
[7:14] afflictions you go through, God could
[7:16] never forget you because he formed you
[7:19] in your mother's womb. Hallelujah. And
[7:22] he forneew you before the foundation of
[7:24] the world. There will be some bonds that
[7:26] are broken and there's strong bonds, no
[7:28] doubt, amongst humans, but there's no
[7:30] greater bond between God and his child.
[7:33] Hallelujah. And he will not forget.
[7:35] Hallelujah. And church, we can say
[7:36] that's thus sayith the
[7:38] scripture. God will not forget us.
[7:41] Hallelujah. And so we remember that
[7:43] remembering our mothers, our precious
[7:44] mothers. And I thought today, my
[7:46] goodness, how my how gracious my mom was
[7:48] to put up with me for nine months. And
[7:51] then she had to nurse me after that. And
[7:53] I thought, my my mom went through so
[7:55] much, you know, five boys and one girl.
[7:56] And brother Vang, your mom and sister
[7:58] Zer, your mom went through eight or
[7:59] nine, was it? 10. 10. God bless sister.
[8:04] True. Amen.
[8:05] 10 times, you know, she went through and
[8:08] just uh put up with all the pains and
[8:10] all the all the agony and all the
[8:13] suffering because she had love for the
[8:15] children. Praise God. And that's like
[8:17] God. God brings and we'll get to that at
[8:19] the end. You know, God brings us all to
[8:21] the birth of the spiritual birth. Praise
[8:23] God. And our if our mothers are able to
[8:25] do that, hallelujah, then God is able to
[8:28] do so much more than what we could do.
[8:29] Praise God. Think about how much a
[8:32] mother gives for her child. Uh
[8:34] Deuteronomy 31:8 says, "And the Lord, he
[8:38] it is that doth go before you. He will
[8:41] be with you. He will not fail thee,
[8:43] neither forsake thee. Fear not, neither
[8:46] be dismayed." Hallelujah. He's telling
[8:48] Moses, "I'll go before you. Don't fear.
[8:51] I'll be with you." Praise God. God will
[8:55] not leave us. Hallelujah. Hebrews 13:5,
[8:57] one of the most beautiful scriptures.
[8:59] For he has said, "I will never leave
[9:01] thee, nor forsake thee." We have a
[9:04] promise. God's presence is always going
[9:06] to stay with us. It's not going
[9:08] anywhere. God's not going to give up on
[9:09] us. Hallelujah. Praise God. He's
[9:11] committed like a mother is to her child.
[9:14] Hallelujah. He won't leave
[9:17] us. Psalm 94:14, "For the Lord will not
[9:21] cast off his people. Neither will he
[9:24] forsake his inheritance." You are God's
[9:27] inheritance. Amen. You are God's
[9:30] offspring. You are God's family. God
[9:32] will not forsake his family. Hallelujah.
[9:36] You know, as as leader, as mothers and
[9:37] fathers, you know, we would do anything
[9:38] to provide for our children. We would go
[9:40] we'd work as many hours as we needed to
[9:42] do. We would do anything to provide good
[9:44] food and and clothes for our children.
[9:46] And how much more is God God going to be
[9:48] with us to provide all that we have need
[9:51] of today?
[9:54] Glory. Psalm 27:10. When my father and
[9:57] my mother forsake me, then the Lord will
[9:59] take me up. So the psalmist knew even if
[10:02] these natural bonds break, I've got a
[10:04] greater bond. I've got a spiritual bond.
[10:07] I've got an eternal bond with God.
[10:09] Hallelujah. And that's why I've said
[10:11] that before. When my dad divorced my
[10:12] mom, God just put other men into my
[10:14] life, mostly coaches, teachers. God just
[10:17] brought other men into my life that I
[10:19] could look up to. And each each one was
[10:21] just like on the next step. I got to
[10:22] have this and that. And they poured into
[10:24] my life. So even when God even when it
[10:26] seems like you know God takes away some
[10:27] influence, God will provide another.
[10:29] Hallelujah. And as I was telling a
[10:31] brother this week, I was telling a
[10:33] brother, you know, even in the lonely
[10:34] times, that's your chance to enjoy
[10:36] fellowship with God because we're all
[10:39] going to get lonely at some point.
[10:40] Praise God. You I can have I have nine
[10:44] kids and a wife. There's times I feel
[10:45] lonely. I'm sure Vang grew up with 10 s
[10:48] nine siblings. I'm sure he felt lonely
[10:50] sometimes, too, because it's it's a it's
[10:52] a it's it's a test. we got to go
[10:54] through. We all must pass the test of
[10:57] loneliness. Amen. It's a spirit, right?
[10:59] It's a It's a spiritual battle. Sorry,
[11:00] buddy. Sorry about that. It's a
[11:02] spiritual battle we got to go through.
[11:03] Everybody's got to pass that way. And we
[11:05] got to learn to fellowship with the
[11:07] greatest friend. We got to learn to
[11:09] become friends with the greatest friend
[11:11] the universe has ever had, God Almighty.
[11:13] Hallelujah.
[11:15] We have to enjoy the times being alone
[11:17] because we're know we know we're not
[11:19] alone. We're alone with God.
[11:23] Satan's going to whisper and say, "See,
[11:25] no, you're all alone. Nobody cares."
[11:26] Well, wasn't Jesus alone on the cross,
[11:28] and yet he overcame
[11:30] and he'll have a he had a loneliness
[11:32] none of us will ever have. God, he said,
[11:34] "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
[11:37] me?" That word means abandoned. God
[11:39] abandoned his own son so you and I won't
[11:42] be abandoned. Hallelujah.
[11:44] Hallelujah.
[11:46] So, in your lonely times, remember God
[11:48] made Jesus lonely so you don't have to
[11:50] be lonely. Praise God.
[11:54] Look at John 10:28. And I give unto them
[11:57] eternal life, and they shall never
[11:58] perish. Church will never go to hell.
[12:00] Hallelujah.
[12:02] Neither shall any man pluck them out of
[12:04] the my hand. He said, "My father is
[12:07] greater than all, and no man is able to
[12:09] pluck them out of my father's hand."
[12:11] Church, just imagine just like just like
[12:13] Tulsi was in my arms last night. She was
[12:15] in my hands, right? Just like Adena sits
[12:18] there in your hands. I don't know. She
[12:19] might be crawling around now. Who knows?
[12:21] But just like church, the baby's in your
[12:24] hand. That's how God holds you. Praise
[12:26] God. You're in the hands of God.
[12:29] Hallelujah. Adena has nothing to fear as
[12:32] long as she's in Vang's hands.
[12:33] Hallelujah. A trustworthy hands. And
[12:36] Tulsi has nothing to fear as long as
[12:38] she's in trustworthy hands. And we
[12:40] couldn't have any more trustworthy hands
[12:41] than the eternal almighty hands of God.
[12:44] The nail scarred hands. Hallelujah.
[12:48] 1st Samuel 12:22. For the Lord will not
[12:51] forsake his people for his great name's
[12:54] sake because it hath pleased the Lord to
[12:56] make you his
[12:58] people. God made me a Christian, brother
[13:01] Austin. Amen. God's the one that called
[13:03] me to this. Praise God. God called us,
[13:05] Brother Vang, to the message.
[13:06] Hallelujah. God made us as people. We
[13:09] didn't go looking for God. God came
[13:10] looking for us. Hallelujah.
[13:13] We are made the people of God. We're
[13:15] made the children of God. We're made
[13:17] kings and priests unto God. God called
[13:19] us to this and God will stay with us.
[13:21] God will be with us. Hallelujah. Amen.
[13:25] Now church, God's, you know, God's has
[13:28] this mother attribute. And what I mean
[13:30] by that is I'm not saying God's
[13:31] feminine. Of course, God makes himself a
[13:33] man. But the mother attribute in the
[13:35] scripture is the helper
[13:38] attribute. Right? Remember uh Genesis
[13:42] 1:27, God created man in his own image.
[13:44] In the image of God created he him. male
[13:47] and female created he them. When God
[13:49] made Adam and Eve, they were a spirit.
[13:51] Brother Austin, like brother Ram said,
[13:52] like a spirit, like a spirit that
[13:54] traveled. And both spirits were inside
[13:57] the spirit. Ma, male and female
[13:58] attributes were inside the one spirit.
[14:01] And then God, you know, put the spirit
[14:02] in Adam the body and then put him down
[14:04] to sleep for the first surgery. Praise
[14:06] God. Oh, God's faithful. Hallelujah. He
[14:08] separated the the female from the male
[14:10] and then had two. But they were created
[14:13] in the image of God. So male and female
[14:15] attributes were the same. And God said
[14:17] in Genesis chapter 2, I'm going to give
[14:20] you a help meat. Hallelujah. Genesis
[14:23] 21:18, the Lord God said, it is not good
[14:26] that man should be alone unless you have
[14:28] the gift of singleness. I will make him
[14:30] an help meat for him. Now this word help
[14:33] means secure. That's another word for
[14:36] help. I'm going to make him a help. I'm
[14:38] going to make him a secure. Hallelujah.
[14:41] Another word is a advocate. Another word
[14:44] is an assistant. We all got our
[14:47] assistants. Hey, so and so or whatever
[14:49] you would say. We all have an assistant
[14:51] on our phone, right? But God gave us an
[14:54] assistant in marriage. The man is the
[14:56] primary power, but God gives him an
[14:59] assistant power. Praise God. Is that
[15:02] right? And that's how God is. God is his
[15:04] primary power, but he has an assistant.
[15:07] Amen. And who's his assistant? The Holy
[15:10] Ghost. Hallelujah. In other words, God's
[15:12] spirit sent out to you.
[15:15] That God is only one spirit, right? The
[15:17] Holy Spirit is not a third person. The
[15:19] Holy Spirit is the person of God. But
[15:22] the Holy Spirit is God's helper. Now,
[15:24] it's God with us. Hallelujah. Amen.
[15:27] Right? That's what Jesus said. Uh if you
[15:29] know your Bible, I'm sure you do. John
[15:32] 14:16. And I'll pray the father and he
[15:34] shall give you another
[15:37] comforter. Again, secure helper.
[15:40] Hallelujah. That he may abide with you
[15:43] forever.
[15:45] Church, the Holy Ghost is not leaving
[15:47] us. Amen. We've just got to please him.
[15:49] We just got to repent of our sins. We
[15:51] got to overcome sin. We got to stop
[15:53] grieving him. And then we'll see him
[15:55] more active in our lives. Okay, I want
[15:57] you to turn on that fan there. I'm
[15:58] getting hot already. If I'm getting hot.
[16:00] Anybody else hot in here? Raise your
[16:00] hand. Anybody else? Yep. Turn that on.
[16:02] Everybody, you can open that window if
[16:03] you feel led, too. Don't feel bad about
[16:06] that, church. If you listen, brother,
[16:07] there's cars honking all the time where
[16:08] brother's preaching. There's be Have you
[16:10] seen the tabernacle? It's right on the
[16:12] corner of an intersection. You've been
[16:13] there. Maybe most of you haven't. I
[16:15] guess I' I'd be the only one that did
[16:17] maybe by God's
[16:19] grace.
[16:21] So Jesus said, "I'm going to send you
[16:24] the comforter, the helper, the
[16:27] secure." In other words, I'm going to
[16:29] send you the female attribute, the
[16:31] helper. So in the marriage, who should
[16:33] be the leader? The man. But you got a
[16:36] helper. Praise God. Because you can't do
[16:37] it all, Brother Vang. Brother Austin,
[16:40] you can't do it all. Hallelujah. I can't
[16:42] do it all. I need a helper. And so God
[16:45] gives me a helper. It's the feminine
[16:47] attribute. Praise God. So for us, the
[16:50] feminine attribute is the Holy Spirit
[16:53] active in our
[16:54] lives. Even the spirit of truth in verse
[16:57] 17, whom the world cannot receive,
[17:00] because it seth him not, neither knoweth
[17:01] him, but ye know him. For he dwelleth
[17:03] with you and shall be in you. Praise
[17:05] God. Oh,
[17:08] glory. Now, uh, in Proverbs 1 verse20,
[17:12] God uses Solomon to describe the female
[17:16] attribute of God. Put that there,
[17:17] Malachi, if you can. Proverbs 1:20. You
[17:19] already got it up there, buddy. Good
[17:20] job. Wisdom cries without. She utter her
[17:24] voice in the street. Now, keep it up
[17:25] there just for a second. Huh? Solomon's
[17:27] writing this beautiful book, and what
[17:29] does he liken unto wisdom? He likens
[17:31] wisdom unto a woman. God's spirit, see
[17:35] the feminine attribute, the Holy Spirit
[17:37] goes out and woos each person, right? It
[17:39] tries to minister to each person. The
[17:41] Holy Spirit is saying, "Receive this.
[17:43] Receive this word. I want to minister to
[17:45] you." Right? That's that's who's with
[17:47] you today. The Holy Spirit's with you
[17:48] today. It's God's feminine attribute.
[17:51] It's like that. It's like that part
[17:53] where the God comes to help you. God's
[17:55] spirit is with you and God likens it
[17:57] unto a woman.
[18:00] Hallelujah. It's not a woman, but it has
[18:03] it's the it's the lesser part. It's the
[18:05] helper part. Praise God. Right? Because
[18:08] God in his greatness, we know God uh he
[18:10] said, "Heaven is my throne. Earth is my
[18:12] foottool. What house you going to build
[18:14] me?" Right? God in his m masculine
[18:16] attribute, but in his feminine
[18:18] attribute, he sends his spirit down to
[18:20] help us out. Praise God. To help us, to
[18:23] comfort us when we need it. Hallelujah.
[18:27] So church, if you have com if you have
[18:28] need of comfort today, God's spirit is
[18:30] here. Praise God. He will comfort you.
[18:33] He will help you. That's
[18:35] right.
[18:37] Now, God cannot forget us. He will
[18:41] comfort us as many scriptures say. I
[18:43] want to go through a few more here. By
[18:45] God's
[18:45] grace, Isaiah 66:13, as one whom his
[18:50] mother comforteth, so will I comfort
[18:52] you, and ye shall be comforted in
[18:54] Jerusalem.
[18:56] So, how could God try to describe his
[18:59] love for us? The best way he describes
[19:01] in the Bible is with the love of a
[19:03] mother. Hallelujah. So, happy Mother's
[19:06] Day again to all the mothers if I didn't
[19:07] say it Aresh. Praise God. Hallelujah. As
[19:10] a mother comforts, so will I comfort
[19:13] you. Praise God. I don't know about you,
[19:16] when I was younger, I just sometimes
[19:17] after church on Sunday, Brother Vang,
[19:19] sometimes when I was younger, I just
[19:20] like to cuddle up by my mom and take a
[19:21] nap on the couch. I don't know if you
[19:22] ever got to do that with all your
[19:24] siblings, brother.
[19:25] But I that was when I was younger, that
[19:27] was one of my favorite things. I just
[19:29] felt so safe in mom's arms. Hallelujah.
[19:32] And that's what God is saying. He said,
[19:35] "My love is like a comforting
[19:37] mother." Hallelujah. Who's the one that
[19:40] first cleaned off your your skinned up
[19:42] knee when you fell off your bike?
[19:43] Probably your mom. That's how it is at
[19:44] our house. Amen. We run to mom and mom
[19:47] who cleaned off. Now they got so many
[19:48] siblings now their siblings can help
[19:50] out. But no doubt Malachi and Aacia and
[19:52] Lydia, first one that cleaned off their
[19:54] skin knees was mom. Hallelujah. That's
[19:58] right. Look at uh Psalm 131 verse two.
[20:02] Surely I behaved and quieted myself as a
[20:05] child that is weaned of his mother. My
[20:07] soul is even as a weaned child. So see
[20:11] church, we're to rest in God like the
[20:13] calm that comes when a baby nurses. And
[20:16] I've seen that a lot lately. Hallelujah.
[20:19] I got seven, six days of watching a baby
[20:21] get calmed by the
[20:23] nursing. Hallelujah. So, see church,
[20:26] that's what God wants you to do. How
[20:27] many How many know you want or how many
[20:29] want the quietness to be in your heart?
[20:31] Praise God. Not the wars and the
[20:33] struggles and the mind battles. How many
[20:35] want a quiet mind? Hallelujah. The peace
[20:38] of God takes over your mind like a
[20:41] nursing child.
[20:43] Hallelujah. God help us to nurse. The
[20:45] Bible said teach us here a little, there
[20:47] a little. Isaiah 28. Teach us your
[20:49] doctrine. Teach us your ways. Teach us
[20:51] your commands. Precept upon precept.
[20:53] Line upon line. Hear a little church. If
[20:55] you just read your Bible today and focus
[20:57] on your Bible, you'll have the comfort
[20:59] of God
[21:00] today.
[21:04] Amen. Glory. Jesus said this in Luke uh
[21:09] 13:34. What does he compare his love to?
[21:12] A mother hen. And I got 16 hens at home,
[21:14] too. So, a lot of this applies to me
[21:16] today. Praise God. I got a mother
[21:18] nursing and I got a uh I got hens at my
[21:21] house. Hallelujah. Oh, Jerusalem,
[21:23] Jerusalem, which killst the prophets and
[21:24] stoneest them that are sent to thee. How
[21:26] often would I have gathered thy children
[21:28] together as a hen gather her brood under
[21:32] her wings and ye would not? How can how
[21:35] does God compare his love to a mother?
[21:39] Now, we don't we haven't had any uh hens
[21:40] that have given uh uh hatch their own
[21:43] chicks, but we've seen them get broody.
[21:46] And they really want a baby, don't they?
[21:47] They those hens really want a baby
[21:49] chick, but they can't get one at our
[21:51] house. At least not yet. But this is
[21:53] what Well, this is what the Lord Jesus
[21:55] compares. Just want to draw them in.
[21:58] Just want the closeness. Just want the
[22:00] fellowship. We've been preaching on
[22:01] communion. How many thankful that God
[22:03] wants to commune with you? Praise God.
[22:05] God could have communed with anybody,
[22:07] but he wants to commune with you and I.
[22:09] Praise God. Sorry to yell so loud in
[22:11] your face there, brother. I'll try to
[22:12] stay up
[22:14] there. That's that's how he compares it.
[22:17] And then how many good nurses did we see
[22:18] in the hospital? 1 Thessalonians 2:7 and
[22:21] 8. My there's so many nice nurses in
[22:23] there. Sometimes there were people I saw
[22:25] that were mistreating the nurses. They
[22:27] would just respond with grace and
[22:28] kindness. They wouldn't fight back and
[22:31] shout back. They just showed so much
[22:33] tenderness. A nurse, a real nurse.
[22:35] Praise God. 1 Thessalonians 2:7 and 8.
[22:38] But we were gentle among you, even as a
[22:41] nurse cherisheth her children. So being
[22:45] affectionately desirous of you.
[22:48] Hallelujah. So who how does Paul compare
[22:50] his love to? Brother Vang, he doesn't
[22:52] say the love of a dad. He says the love
[22:54] of a
[22:55] nurse. Hallelujah.
[22:58] So let's look at this attribute today
[23:00] and see how God wants to show forth his
[23:03] love. The Holy Spirit is like a mother's
[23:06] love. Now everybody knows that sometimes
[23:08] dad's got tough love, right? Sometimes
[23:11] dad's got really tough love and
[23:12] sometimes we need tough love. But we
[23:14] also need a balance. We need tough love
[23:16] and we need tender love because we can
[23:18] see God gives us
[23:20] both, right? Sometimes God is harsh with
[23:23] us, very stern with us, uh, deals with
[23:26] us in a very serious way. Other times,
[23:28] God is slow to anger, rich in mercy.
[23:34] Hallelujah. Now, let's go to uh I want
[23:37] to just uh look at this thought here.
[23:38] Look at a few more thoughts before I get
[23:40] to my main point. I'm not to my main
[23:41] point yet. Let's go to Hebrews
[23:45] 11:23. Let's look at this here. I I just
[23:48] look at Moses's mother. Look at look at
[23:50] what a mother we have
[23:53] here. Hebrews 11:23. By faith, Moses
[23:56] when he was born was hid three months of
[23:58] his parents. I guess yeah, we got both
[23:59] in here. Yeah, we got uh both Jockabed
[24:03] and Amra here. For three months because
[24:06] they saw he was a proper child and they
[24:09] were not afraid of the king's
[24:10] commandments. So perhaps there was a
[24:11] pillar of fire when he was born like
[24:13] when brother Brandon was born.
[24:15] Hallelujah. But notice notice what the
[24:18] parents did. They hid the child from
[24:21] death, right? They they took active
[24:24] measures to hide the child from evil.
[24:27] That's what we should do as parents.
[24:29] Keep our kids from evil. As long as we
[24:31] can.
[24:32] Somebody asked a question one time. When
[24:34] should I give my child a smartphone?
[24:36] When you want their childhood to end.
[24:38] That's when you give them a smartphone.
[24:40] Or give them a tablet. When you want
[24:41] their childhood to end and their
[24:42] innocence to leave, that's when you give
[24:45] them one. And the church said, "Amen."
[24:48] That's right. Protect them. Hide them
[24:51] from evil. Remember Mary and Joseph hid
[24:54] Jesus from
[24:55] Herod. Hallelujah. God had a hedge
[24:58] around Job. Amen. He was hiding Job from
[25:02] all the suffering. Now, did of course he
[25:04] had to go through suffering. We all go
[25:05] through those times. But church, if we
[25:07] look at it, most of the time God was
[25:08] hiding him. And that's what brother Ram
[25:10] said. He he said, Brother Ram said, "I
[25:12] always pray God, don't let Satan get at
[25:14] me. Keep a hedge around me. Don't let
[25:17] him get to me. Right? And that's and
[25:18] that's why Jesus put that in the the
[25:20] Lord's prayer. He said, "Lead me not
[25:23] into temptation, but deliver me from
[25:26] evil." Have you thought about that
[25:28] lately, church? It is okay to pray,
[25:30] "God, keep me from
[25:33] temptation." Because that's what Jesus
[25:35] prayed in the garden. He said, "Lord, if
[25:38] it's possible, let this cup pass from
[25:41] me." There's nothing wrong with praying
[25:43] that. God, keep me from evil. God, keep
[25:45] me from this. keep me from that. There's
[25:47] nothing wrong with that. But you got to
[25:48] end the prayer with let thy will be
[25:50] done, not my will be
[25:52] done. That's in the Lord's prayer. Lead
[25:55] me not into temptation. In other words,
[25:57] please, I don't want to have to go
[25:59] through this. God, let your mercy extend
[26:00] to me. And church, how many know God
[26:03] many times answers our
[26:05] prayer? The Bible says God doesn't give
[26:08] us the punishment we
[26:10] deserve. God is so merciful. We don't
[26:12] always We certainly don't always get
[26:14] what we deserve.
[26:15] Hallelujah. That's right. Are you with
[26:18] me, church? Are you with me? Moses's
[26:20] parents hid him from Pharaoh. Rahab hid
[26:24] the
[26:25] spies. And not only that, the Bible said
[26:28] we are hid in Christ. Hallelujah. Amen.
[26:32] Praise God. God's hiding us in Christ
[26:35] from Satan. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[26:38] Glory to God. This is what love does.
[26:42] See, that's my my wife right now,
[26:44] brother Bang. She's hiding uh Tulsi away
[26:47] from our sick kids upstairs. We're
[26:49] quarantining. Reminds us of 2020. Praise
[26:52] God. We're quarantining mom and baby
[26:55] away from everybody else. See, she's
[26:57] hiding her away so she doesn't get
[27:01] sick. She needs to build up her immune
[27:03] system the right way. Praise God. And so
[27:05] is Kristen being protected as well. But
[27:08] this is the love of God. This is what
[27:10] God's love does. It hides. It protects
[27:13] as long as
[27:14] possible. That's the love of God. And
[27:17] church, you are hidden in
[27:19] Christ. I am hidden in Christ. If Satan
[27:23] wants to get to me, Sister Nomi, first
[27:25] he's got to go through the devil. I'm
[27:27] sorry. First, Satan's got to go through
[27:28] Jesus, right? Because sorry, I'm hidden
[27:30] in Christ. Hallelujah. Satan can't get
[27:32] to me because Jesus is standing before
[27:35] me protecting me. Hallelujah. Amen. He
[27:38] can't get at me unless he goes through
[27:40] Jesus first. I got scripture for it. And
[27:44] then the Bible said he'll go before you.
[27:45] He'll be your re-reward. He'll be on the
[27:47] side. Talk about singing the blessing
[27:49] today. Something like that. Amen. He's
[27:51] all around me. He goes before me. He's
[27:53] behind me. God is our protector. God is
[27:56] our shield. God is our strength. God is
[27:58] our sword. Hallelujah. Amen.
[28:04] Church, here's what we need. Courage.
[28:06] Let's not be afraid of what could
[28:08] happen. Let's have courage. Hallelujah.
[28:12] God is with us. God will not fail us.
[28:15] Hallelujah. And what is I think it's
[28:17] Psalm
[28:18] 119:11. Thy word have I hid in my heart.
[28:21] It's been a while since I quoted that
[28:22] one. That I might There it is. Let's
[28:23] read this. Ready? One, two, three. Thy
[28:25] word have I hid in mine heart that I
[28:28] might not sin against thee. You want to
[28:30] overcome sin, put the word in your
[28:33] heart. Start quoting the word. memorize
[28:36] a verse so you have something to fight
[28:39] with. That's how you overcome. And the
[28:41] church said, "Hide it." Praise God. Just
[28:44] like uh just like Jockabed and Amra,
[28:47] hide, Moses. Hide that word. Praise God.
[28:50] Protect that word. Let that word be your
[28:53] absolute. That is eternal life.
[28:55] Hallelujah. It's living water. It's your
[28:57] daily bread. Amen. It's your sword. It's
[29:00] your source of strength. Praise God.
[29:02] Glory. I haven't preaching a while, so
[29:04] bear with me. Hallelujah.
[29:11] Next, I want to read this one here for
[29:13] all of us, but Hebrews 11:11, especially
[29:16] sister Naomi here. Sarah had no ability
[29:19] to bring forth a
[29:21] child, right? Because she was old, the
[29:23] deadness of her her her womb, and
[29:26] Abraham had the deadness of his loins.
[29:28] But what happened? God visited her in
[29:31] order so she'd be strengthened to bring
[29:33] forth a child. And as I saw it with my
[29:36] wife, and I'm sure Bang saw it with his
[29:38] wife, Lori probably saw it. God comes
[29:40] around and he strengthens the mom so the
[29:43] mom can bring forth the child.
[29:46] Hallelujah. Through faith also. Sarah
[29:48] herself, receive strength and to
[29:50] conceive seed. So church, let's apply it
[29:52] spiritually. If we're weak, let's let's
[29:54] let's quote Isaiah. Let the weak say I'm
[29:57] strong. Praise God. Let's invite the
[30:00] Holy Spirit. Say, "Holy Spirit, drop
[30:01] down today. Visit me. Give me strength.
[30:04] Give me courage. Restore my joy. Give me
[30:06] some type of a blessing that I know
[30:08] you're with me. Hallelujah.
[30:11] Yes. Why we want to be weak? Why we want
[30:14] to be struggling? Why do we want to be
[30:15] in defeat? The Bible said faith will
[30:18] help you receive strength and then
[30:20] you'll be able to bring forth God's will
[30:22] in your life. Hallelujah.
[30:26] That's
[30:26] right. See, God always sends divine
[30:29] help. If you want it, God's going to
[30:30] send it.
[30:33] Yes,
[30:35] sir. Go to uh Philippians 2:19 20 and
[30:48] 21. Philippians 2:19 2021. Now, this
[30:52] let's look at Timothy for a moment. Now,
[30:54] these are familiar scriptures, but let's
[30:55] look a little deeper by God's grace. But
[30:58] I trust in the Lord Jesus to send
[31:00] Timothy shortly unto you, that I also
[31:02] may be of good comfort when I know your
[31:05] state. Just stay right there. Go back if
[31:07] you would there, buddy. Uh, what does
[31:09] comfort mean again? Helper,
[31:12] secure. So, see, sometimes God sends
[31:15] somebody anointed with the Holy Ghost.
[31:17] Sometimes that's the feminine attribute
[31:19] of God. Whenever somebody comes around
[31:21] to help you, that's God's spirit helping
[31:23] you in the feminine attribute, a helper.
[31:26] Jesus said, "I'm going to send you a
[31:28] comforter." It's the Holy Ghost.
[31:31] Hallelujah. And then Jesus says,
[31:33] "Whenever you did it to the least of
[31:35] these, my brethren, you've done it unto
[31:37] me." Praise God. It's God hiding behind
[31:39] the veil of human flesh. Church, you
[31:42] should love me. I should love you
[31:43] because God's hiding behind your veil.
[31:45] Hallelujah.
[31:47] God is the Holy Spirit. How do you know?
[31:50] Because you do the works of Christ.
[31:52] Hallelujah. If you Jesus said, "If you
[31:54] love me, keep my commands." Hallelujah.
[31:57] So, we keep God's commands and we know
[31:59] God is hiding behind our veil. And this
[32:02] is what Paul experienced when he was
[32:04] struggling, when he needed some comfort.
[32:05] God sent him a a man God in flesh.
[32:09] Timothy verse
[32:12] 20. For I have no man like-minded who
[32:15] will naturally care for your state. Now,
[32:16] this is a beautiful verse that really
[32:17] encouraged me. For all seek their own,
[32:20] not the things which are Jesus Christ.
[32:21] So, just leave that up there. Timothy
[32:24] came to visit Paul when most people
[32:27] wouldn't.
[32:28] Hallelujah. And notice there's nobody as
[32:32] as like the prophet as much as Timothy
[32:35] was a a gentile church. I'm I'm sorry.
[32:37] Mix interracial child.
[32:40] Hallelujah. Between Jew and Greek. All
[32:44] these people don't know what they're
[32:45] talking about about interracial
[32:46] marriage. Right? He's a Jew, half Jew,
[32:49] half Greek. And yet nobody was like the
[32:52] Holy Ghost filled prophet as much as
[32:54] this
[32:56] man. Hallelujah. And he was a comfort to
[32:59] Paul. He was a help to Paul. This church
[33:03] service ought to be a comfort to you.
[33:04] Praise God. Shaking somebody's hand,
[33:06] hugging somebody, encouraging them,
[33:08] strengthening them. That ought to be a
[33:10] blessing. That ought to be a comfort to
[33:11] you. Praise God. Oh, Brother Jesse still
[33:13] standing. Oh, Sister Z still got her
[33:15] fire. Oh, Brother Nia still comes to
[33:17] worship and praise God. There's Malachi
[33:19] still with the fire of God to play the
[33:20] piano. We ought to encourage one
[33:22] another. It ought to be a comfort to us.
[33:24] Praise God. We're still in the faith.
[33:26] We're not giving up. We're trusting God.
[33:28] We're casting down anything that exalts
[33:30] itself against the word of God. And
[33:32] we're overcoming by the grace of God
[33:35] because God is here to comfort
[33:38] us. Hallelujah.
[33:42] All right. Go to
[33:43] uh 2 Timothy 15. Got your Bible?
[33:49] 2 Timothy
[33:51] 15 when I call to remembrance the
[33:54] unfeign that means
[33:56] pure not pretend genuine
[34:00] integrity when I call recall to
[34:03] remembrance the genuine faith that's in
[34:05] you Timothy which dwelt first where did
[34:07] it dwell first in your grandmother Lois
[34:09] and your mother
[34:11] Ununice why does Timothy have such
[34:13] genuine faith because his mom and
[34:16] grandma taught him the
[34:19] How many thankful for a godly mother or
[34:21] grandmother?
[34:22] Hallelujah. If you didn't have that in
[34:24] the natural, you surely got in the
[34:26] spiritual because that was the Holy
[34:27] Ghost. Praise God. Who's with you?
[34:29] Praise
[34:30] God. And I am persuaded that in the
[34:37] also. Hallelujah. Now, how many know
[34:40] Timothy? Timothy's name means honoring
[34:43] God. So, it's a pretty good name right
[34:45] there.
[34:48] He was the son of a mixed marriage.
[34:50] According to the lexicon, it appears his
[34:52] father died when he was still young and
[34:54] he was raised by his mother and
[34:56] grandmother mother according to strict
[34:58] Jewish
[34:59] traditions. And church, who who was he
[35:03] most like? He was most like the first
[35:05] church age messenger. And he never had a
[35:07] dad there. And the church said, "Oh, I
[35:11] didn't have my dad. I didn't have my
[35:13] mom. My dad left me."
[35:14] church. God may allow that for a
[35:17] testimony. Just because awful things
[35:19] happen, just because the natural parent
[35:21] might not be there, God, the
[35:23] supernatural parent is there.
[35:26] Hallelujah.
[35:28] So this man, he has no dad, but his
[35:30] mother and his grandmother pour the
[35:32] scriptures into him. And then he becomes
[35:35] most like Paul, the church age messenger
[35:39] to the Ephesian church age who said, "If
[35:42] you change one thing that Jesus revealed
[35:44] to me, you're cursed." He said, "My
[35:48] goodness, there's a serious commandment
[35:51] we have to keep." Praise God.
[35:53] Hallelujah. Go to 2 Timothy 3:15.
[35:59] Turks, the best thing you teach your
[36:01] children is the holy
[36:03] scriptures. Teach your children the holy
[36:05] scriptures. I'm just looking at bang and
[36:07] uh myself and sister
[36:10] Naomi, teach your children the
[36:13] scriptures. If you if you want to have
[36:15] you want to see your children have faith
[36:16] like brother Brandham or faith like St.
[36:18] Paul, teach them the scripture because
[36:20] look look that's how Timothy turned out
[36:22] so good. and that from a child thouast
[36:25] known the holy scriptures which are able
[36:28] to make thee wise unto salvation through
[36:31] faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[36:34] Hallelujah. See, Timothy knew the word
[36:37] from a young age. Hallelujah. Therefore,
[36:41] he was uh able to receive the word of
[36:43] God and receive God's prophet St. Paul
[36:46] and then become like him in his mind and
[36:49] then he could be a comfort to people
[36:50] that needed comfort.
[36:54] That's right. Glory to God.
[37:00] Hallelujah. Nobody was like Paul as much
[37:03] as Timothy. What a what a
[37:05] testimony. I didn't even keep track of
[37:07] time. So, all right. Now, get to my main
[37:09] point here. Let's look at the
[37:10] selflessness of a mother. This see when
[37:14] when a woman has so much compassion,
[37:15] this this deep affection, it causes her
[37:19] to sacrifice for the child.
[37:22] And that's
[37:24] selflessness, right? Most people today
[37:26] don't want children. They're
[37:28] selfish. I'm talking about if they don't
[37:30] want it. It's the difference between not
[37:31] being able to have it and not wanting
[37:32] it. And the church
[37:34] said they all want cats and dogs and
[37:37] whatever they got. They don't they
[37:38] anything but a child is what they say.
[37:41] They'll be judged for that. That's
[37:42] selfish
[37:45] pride. But let's look at the
[37:48] selflessness of a mother. her body gets
[37:51] totally changed
[37:52] permanently. How many times does a
[37:54] mother feed her children before she
[37:56] feeds
[37:59] herself? How many times does a mother
[38:02] take care of her child's needs before
[38:04] her own needs? Most of the time it's
[38:07] totally
[38:09] selfless. It's a life it's it's the life
[38:13] of
[38:14] sacrifice. You know, I see my wife do
[38:16] it. I don't I hardly ever I I can't say
[38:18] she's perfect, but I hardly ever hear
[38:20] her
[38:22] complain, right? She just does it. I've
[38:25] been around her six days with this baby.
[38:27] I never heard her complain once about
[38:28] nursing all day, every day, changing
[38:31] diaper. I've only changed a handful of
[38:33] diapers. Can't trust me with too many
[38:35] diapers. I might mess it up. But no
[38:38] complaints. She just change. She just
[38:40] goes from one and just stares at the
[38:42] baby. Look at the baby. Love the baby.
[38:45] Hallelujah.
[38:47] See, she's selfless. And that's what I'm
[38:50] trying to show you. That's God's love.
[38:51] Amen. God will cross. Brother Ram said,
[38:55] "He'll cross the Milky White way." Amen.
[38:56] He'll cross all space and time just to
[38:59] answer your prayer. Hallelujah.
[39:02] We know God is selfless. And we know God
[39:04] is sacrificial. Praise
[39:05] God. He did all these things for his
[39:09] pleasure. Hallelujah. He created all
[39:12] this for our enjoyment. Ecclesiastes
[39:14] says, right, brother Austin, we I read
[39:15] that recently, too. God, the Bible, he
[39:18] said it's the gift of God to have a job
[39:20] and food and clothes and and happiness
[39:23] in the home. All these things God did so
[39:25] for our enjoyment, enjoy the creation of
[39:30] God. Hallelujah.
[39:34] I'd like to
[39:36] uh briefly look at labor and then a
[39:41] C-section because this is the first
[39:42] C-section we have I ever experienced.
[39:44] There's three stages to labor. There's
[39:47] the dilation, then there's the pushing,
[39:50] and then there's the placental
[39:52] delivery. And think what this mother's
[39:54] going through, church, just just bear
[39:56] with me. In that first stage, it lasts
[39:59] six to 18 hours. That's the average.
[40:03] of just the the dilation and this is
[40:06] cramp like lower abdominal or back
[40:11] ache for only six to 18 hours only. My
[40:16] wife did about 48
[40:17] hours. It was a tough couple days here.
[40:20] Brother Vang, I don't know if I've had
[40:21] harder days in my life and seeing my
[40:23] wife go through
[40:25] this. When the second stage is the
[40:28] pushing, this gives like a burning or
[40:30] ring of fire.
[40:32] type of
[40:33] feeling feels a there's a strong strong
[40:37] pressure to cause the baby to pass
[40:39] through. It causes some to go to
[40:41] exhaustion. This can be 30 minutes or
[40:44] three
[40:46] hours. They just they don't feel any
[40:49] relief until the baby is
[40:51] pushed. And after the baby emerges, then
[40:53] it's the placental delivery. This is
[40:56] milder cramping. It's a final short
[40:58] push.
[41:00] And the uh the women often feel
[41:02] shivering, chills, euphoria, or
[41:05] fatigue. Any of this sound comfortable
[41:07] to the brothers out
[41:09] there? You're blessed. You don't have to
[41:11] go through
[41:13] it.
[41:15] Hallelujah. That's just that's the
[41:17] natural labor. Now, my wife went through
[41:18] that eight times. Eight natural
[41:22] labors. So, there's all these types of
[41:24] pains. Uh there's visceral pain in the
[41:28] muscles. Uh this is just general.
[41:30] There's spinal nerve pain. Lower back
[41:34] pain. Uh pelvic floor pain. Look pain.
[41:39] Sharp burning pains. Localized pains.
[41:42] I'm just generalizing here. Muscular
[41:44] skele. Look at that fancy word. Muscular
[41:47] muscularkeeletal strain and
[41:50] fatigue. Your muscles and everything get
[41:52] strained and fatigued. All for what? For
[41:54] the child. For somebody else.
[41:56] Amen. You're not suffering that for
[41:58] yourself. You're suffering that to give
[42:00] somebody else life.
[42:02] Hallelujah. God bless our mothers.
[42:05] Amen. God bless Ruby Smith. She did it
[42:09] for me. God bless True. She did it for
[42:13] all 10 of you. Hallelujah. God bless our
[42:14] mothers here. Amen. Beatatric and Naomi.
[42:18] God bless you. You endured all this pain
[42:23] like Jesus in one way, right? It's a
[42:24] it's a type. Jesus endured all that
[42:27] according to Hebrews 12 for the joy that
[42:30] was set before him. Praise God. And a
[42:33] woman's pain is awful, but it compares
[42:35] nothing to what Jesus did. Of course, we
[42:37] understand that. But God lets the woman
[42:39] understand in a minor way. Suffering for
[42:43] somebody else's life. Hallelujah.
[42:48] Amen. Now, my wife knows on another
[42:50] level. 48 hours of suffering.
[42:54] But, you know, you look at her now, she
[42:55] looks all happy. I know she's at home.
[42:57] Probably is smiling right now. And I'm
[42:59] sure she'll have about 10 corrections
[43:00] when I get home. Praise God. Or maybe
[43:03] I'll get a text with
[43:06] those. I probably forgot some details,
[43:08] Brother
[43:09] V. But you you see her now, she's all
[43:11] happy, got the baby, and
[43:14] smiling. And church, then there's pain
[43:16] even after. It's called postpartum pain.
[43:19] It's more cramp cramps and contractions.
[43:23] Sitting can hurt because of tears,
[43:27] soreness. There's throbbing of body
[43:31] parts. There's emotional uh they call it
[43:34] lability, baby blues, right? How I
[43:36] prayed for a few mothers, brother Vang
[43:38] and brother Austin in the prayer line
[43:39] over the years. I prayed for different
[43:40] mothers when I've gone other places.
[43:42] They're having like this depression
[43:43] after they have a baby. But that's just
[43:45] natural. That's something they got to
[43:48] endure. I think my wife went through one
[43:50] time and Joe Adams is like, "That's the
[43:51] devil. Rebuke Satan." and my wife got a
[43:53] good victory there. It's just that
[43:55] discouragement trying to come on, right?
[43:58] But that all comes after you've already
[44:01] done all this
[44:03] sacrifice. And what what is it that's
[44:05] able to endure that? The love of a
[44:08] mother.
[44:09] Amen. There should be a Mother's Day.
[44:12] There ought to be a mother's week. Amen.
[44:14] Ought to be a mother's
[44:16] month. For who? For you. God did that
[44:20] for you, brother Nia.
[44:22] God did that for
[44:24] me. So the pain is dynamic. The internet
[44:28] says each labor is
[44:30] different and support matters.
[44:33] Continuous compassionate
[44:35] presence can lessen the perceived pain
[44:38] by 25 to 30% in randomized trials. So
[44:42] sister Naomi, get somebody around you
[44:43] that's going to encourage you.
[44:45] Hallelujah.
[44:47] That's a, you know, when I was there,
[44:48] the doula looked at me and said, Jesse,
[44:50] she said, go on the other side by
[44:52] Kristen's face and tell her she's doing
[44:55] a good job and rub her hand. I'm like,
[44:56] oh, thanks. I appreciate that. Forgot
[44:58] about
[45:01] that. So, hopefully that helped. We'll
[45:03] have to talk about that when we get
[45:04] home,
[45:07] too. But, but the reason many mothers
[45:10] can endure this is because the suffering
[45:12] has a purpose and it's meaningful.
[45:15] It brings forth
[45:17] life, which is the most precious gift
[45:20] naturally, right? Naturally, the most
[45:23] precious gift is life, physical life.
[45:26] That's right. The greatest gift, of
[45:28] course, is spiritual, eternal life,
[45:30] being saved.
[45:32] Hallelujah. But the greatest gift in the
[45:34] natural would be life, new life.
[45:36] Hallelujah. Now, let's look at
[45:38] C-section. That's just natural. Here we
[45:40] are.
[45:41] C-section. Never thought I'd see it,
[45:43] Brother V. But boy, did I see
[45:46] it. So, first there's the pre-operative
[45:49] phase, which is 30 to 60
[45:53] minutes. That's the consent, the IV
[45:56] line, the mele, I'm sorry, the fetal
[45:59] monitoring, and I'm going to leave out
[46:01] some of the details, and anesthesia
[46:02] placement. And then there's the
[46:04] intraoperative phase, which is 30 to 50
[46:06] minutes
[46:09] total. The positioning of the mother,
[46:11] the drape. So, I was I was behind the
[46:13] drape with my wife there. I didn't want
[46:15] to look at that, you know? I'm just not
[46:16] into that kind of thing. Then there's
[46:19] the skin incisions. Then there's the
[46:21] opening. Then there's the delivery of
[46:23] the
[46:24] baby. And then there's the placental
[46:27] removal and the uterine repair. And then
[46:30] is the layer by layer closure. So I was
[46:34] just standing there encouraging my wife
[46:35] and all of a sudden I hear a nice loud
[46:37] scream. I said, "Praise God." And my
[46:38] wife said that was the one of the most
[46:40] wonderful sounds she ever heard. That
[46:41] screaming
[46:42] baby after all those hours of labor and
[46:46] everything like that. And the the doctor
[46:47] said, "You want to look, Jesse?" I'm
[46:49] like, "Okay, here I
[46:51] go." And church, I saw a baby covered in
[46:54] blood in a pool of blood. But I it
[46:56] didn't even bother me. I was just
[46:57] thankful to see
[46:59] life. Hallelujah.
[47:02] It was something I'll probably never
[47:04] forget. And I might, as I get older, I
[47:05] might forget, but I took pictures as
[47:07] soon as the baby was over there on the
[47:09] table. They had three people working on
[47:11] towels and wiping off as much as they
[47:13] could. Three people, three grown
[47:15] adults, clean off the child. And we
[47:18] found out later, Brother Bank, the the
[47:20] doctor had to cut through eight layers
[47:22] of skin and all the layers of organs.
[47:26] Eight layers. And I thought, that's
[47:28] about right. We got eight layers on the
[47:30] stature of perfect
[47:32] man. Faith, virtue, knowledge,
[47:34] temperance, patience, godliness,
[47:36] brotherly kindness, charity. And the
[47:39] church said, "Amen. Hallelujah. Eight
[47:43] layers to make sure life comes forth."
[47:45] Hallelujah.
[47:51] I've never seen so much blood in all my
[47:52] life, but I've also never been so happy
[47:54] in all my life. to see a baby healthy,
[48:00] strong after wondering for days what's
[48:03] going to happen. But is that all the
[48:05] suffering of mom? No, it's really just
[48:07] began. Praise
[48:08] God. Then there's immediate recovery
[48:10] which lasts at least two hours. Local
[48:13] anesthesia starts to wear off. You get
[48:15] the cramps, right? They still get the
[48:16] cramps of of the of the
[48:20] uh of of everything closing up and and
[48:23] and so forth. Then there's all these gas
[48:25] pains, shoulder pains. There's the
[48:27] shiverings that still last. Then there's
[48:30] the early post-operative period, 24 to
[48:32] 70 72
[48:35] hours. Oh my, there's so much going on
[48:37] here. I I can't get all of it. Then
[48:39] there's the the the recovery is at least
[48:41] 6 weeks. Of course, it needs to go
[48:43] longer than that.
[48:45] You got the uh incision soreness and the
[48:47] itching, the neuropathic twinges, the
[48:50] electric twinges of all the nerves
[48:52] coming back together when they sew all
[48:54] the eight layers, eight layers back
[48:56] together. Then there's back pain. Your
[48:58] your core is
[49:00] weak, your altered gate, I don't even
[49:02] know what that is. And then the
[49:05] emotional landscape. There's relief.
[49:06] There's pride or we'd say joy. There's
[49:09] also disappointment or sometimes people
[49:11] feel guilt about these things.
[49:14] There's the risk of postpartum
[49:15] depression similar to the regular
[49:19] labor. And
[49:21] church, do most of the moms complain?
[49:24] No. They they recognize at the minute,
[49:25] wow, I'm there's pain, there's
[49:26] suffering, but do most of them complain?
[49:28] No. They do it for the child. And the
[49:31] church said, and your mom did it for
[49:36] you. So, how selfless is a mom? She
[49:40] endures all the suffering, all the pain,
[49:43] head to toe pain. Really, she endures it
[49:46] all because like
[49:49] Jesus, hallelujah, was uh for the joy
[49:53] that was set before him. She's looking
[49:54] for the joy of raising this child for
[49:57] the glory of
[49:58] God. And remember friends, there's no
[50:01] greater love that a man had than this
[50:03] than to lay down his life for his
[50:06] friends. And that's what a mother does
[50:07] every time she has a child. She lays
[50:10] down her life for her for her
[50:13] child. I don't know if I told you
[50:15] brothers this yet, but my wife had to
[50:16] have a C-section because of what's
[50:17] called a bandal's ring. The uterus
[50:20] develops a ring and the baby cannot get
[50:22] out. Cannot the natural way. It's called
[50:26] a bandal's ring. And the doctor said, he
[50:28] said, "Uh, Mr. Smith, we've I've only
[50:30] seen this three times and I'm sorry,
[50:32] four times in 30
[50:34] years. So, church, if there wasn't a
[50:36] such a thing as C-section, my wife and
[50:38] the baby would not be here today. You
[50:41] better believe I'm thankful for
[50:42] education and medicine.
[50:44] Hallelujah. If this was the old days,
[50:46] I'd be a widow right now. A
[50:49] widowerower. But thank God that I was I
[50:52] was praying that this morning in the
[50:53] closet. I said, "Lord, thank you that I
[50:55] live in an hour where knowledge is
[50:57] increased." Praise God. Because I'd be a
[51:00] widowerower if it wasn't for the grace
[51:01] of God. The doctor just did it so easy.
[51:04] I couldn't believe it. It was just so
[51:06] amazing. And this spared her life. But
[51:09] she did it. She was willing to go under
[51:11] the table and be cut through eight
[51:12] layers in order to bring forth life. And
[51:15] how how how much more should we be
[51:17] willing to go through to try to get
[51:18] people to receive eternal life. Praise
[51:20] God. We should preach to him. We should
[51:23] pray for him. We should witness to him.
[51:24] Try to encourage them. We should do
[51:26] everything we can to try to get people
[51:27] to receive eternal life. Hallelujah.
[51:31] That's what a mother does for natural
[51:33] life. She lays down her life. And how
[51:36] many mothers down through the age died
[51:38] like Rachel giving forth their
[51:40] child? Rachel died giving life to
[51:44] Benjamin.
[51:45] Hallelujah. What greater love could
[51:47] there be? No greater love than
[51:50] that. And then church, first, I'm sorry,
[51:53] 3R John 1:4 says, "I have no greater joy
[51:56] than to hear my children walk in the
[51:58] truth.
[52:00] See, the mother's praying one day this
[52:02] child's going to grow up and they're
[52:03] going to love
[52:04] Jesus. They're going to serve Jesus. And
[52:06] then I'll have the greatest joy I could
[52:08] ever
[52:09] have. Is to know that my children are
[52:12] going to keep serving God. They're going
[52:14] to keep going to church. They're going
[52:15] to read their Bible every day. They're
[52:16] going to pray every day. They're going
[52:18] to love God. They're going to give God
[52:20] every day of their lives. That would be
[52:21] the greatest joy they could possibly
[52:23] have to know that they love Jesus just
[52:25] like the mother loved Jesus.
[52:31] Glory. So the mother is cut. She bleeds.
[52:35] She's wounded. She suffers hours in the
[52:38] middle of the night. Day and night,
[52:40] night and day, she suffers. Why? For the
[52:42] baby's
[52:44] sake.
[52:50] Hallelujah. Let me close with this.
[52:58] Friends, that was all natural birth. The
[53:02] mother goes through all that for a
[53:04] natural birth. Let's just look briefly
[53:06] as we close. What did God do for the
[53:08] spiritual birth when the spiritual birth
[53:11] took place on the day of Pentecost? What
[53:14] did God put up with? What did God's
[53:16] spirit in other words like this how many
[53:19] times did God's spirit have to be
[53:20] grieved until the birth was brought
[53:23] forth?
[53:27] Hallelujah. Mothers suffer through so
[53:30] much. What did God have to deal with?
[53:31] Let's look at those 12 apostles. Well,
[53:34] Judas left. So, that's one of them that
[53:36] God had to deal with. A a betrayer. God
[53:39] God let Jesus be betrayed before the
[53:41] birth of the church. Suffering betrayal.
[53:47] Now church, we know the disciples had
[53:49] virtue when they were preaching two by
[53:51] two, but then they lost all their
[53:53] virtue on the night of Jesus's arrest
[53:57] because the Bible prophesied they'd be
[53:59] scattered like
[54:01] sheep. Hallelujah. Because of their fear
[54:04] of
[54:05] arrest. See, church, God put up with
[54:07] this. God put up with the apostles
[54:09] losing all their virtue.
[54:12] They wouldn't even stand with
[54:15] Jesus, right? They wouldn't even stand
[54:17] there with Jesus to try to be a comfort
[54:19] and be a help. They ran for fear after
[54:21] saying, "I'll never leave you, Jesus.
[54:23] I'll die with you, Jesus. Listen to
[54:26] me. Look at these men." See, church,
[54:30] without God, we're nothing. I'm talking
[54:32] about each one of us, male and female.
[54:33] Without God, we have nothing. We can
[54:36] brag and boast and do all these things,
[54:38] but if we don't have God with us, it
[54:40] won't make any difference. we won't have
[54:41] any strength. God's the one who gives us
[54:44] strength. Praise God.
[54:47] Hallelujah. And God had to put up with
[54:49] this grieving of his spirit that his 11
[54:52] apostles all run. John's only one at the
[54:54] cross. But the Bible said they all were
[54:56] scattered.
[55:01] Knowledge. Jesus' own apostles, they
[55:04] lack the understanding about how men are
[55:06] defiled. Right? They didn't understand
[55:07] Jesus. How are men defiled? by not
[55:10] washing their hands. And Jesus said,
[55:11] "It's it's what comes out of the heart
[55:13] is what defiles us, right? Hallelujah."
[55:18] And they didn't understand the leaven of
[55:19] the doctrine of the Pharisees and
[55:21] Sadducees. They didn't understand Jesus
[55:23] resurrection. So all these times Jesus
[55:25] is teaching them, they're not catching
[55:27] it. And that grieves the Holy Spirit.
[55:30] But church, what was it? It was birth
[55:32] pains. See, this is pains we must go
[55:34] through. Failure after failure, failure
[55:37] leading up to the birth. Amen.
[55:39] Hallelujah. That's what mothers go
[55:41] through. Birth pain. I saw it this week.
[55:43] Birth pain after birth pain, right? Uh
[55:46] what is it called? Uh the I can't
[55:48] remember now.
[55:49] The I can't remember now. My
[55:52] goodness. The pressure. I can't remember
[55:54] the name of it. What's it called? Yeah,
[55:56] contract. There it is. I can't remember
[55:57] that word. It's been a long week. Praise
[55:59] God. Contraction after contraction. Yet,
[56:02] it's bringing forth new life.
[56:04] Hallelujah. Temperance. Remember the
[56:06] disciples lacked temperance
[56:10] uh because they got angry at at James
[56:12] and John because their mother asked if
[56:15] James and John could sit on Jesus right
[56:17] and left hand. They got in indignant
[56:19] with one
[56:20] another, right? And that grieved the
[56:22] Holy Spirit of God. Why would they get
[56:24] mad at each other? And but see, it was
[56:27] bringing forth a birth. It was a
[56:28] contraction to show them we don't worry
[56:31] about who sits on the right hand. Just
[56:32] be in heaven. Hallelujah. Just make the
[56:35] rapture. Praise God for us.
[56:37] Hallelujah.
[56:41] Patience. Remember, they didn't have
[56:43] much patience. They asked to send away
[56:45] the Canaan woman who repeatedly cried
[56:47] for Jesus to heal her vexed daughter,
[56:49] right? They were they were impatient.
[56:51] Oh, just leave here. The master is too
[56:53] busy. Right? They were impatient with
[56:55] moms who wanted their children delivered
[56:58] from demons, but God brought them
[57:00] through the contraction. Oh, hallelujah.
[57:03] Amen.
[57:05] Godliness. James and John wanted to call
[57:07] down fire. He said, "Jesus, do you want
[57:09] us to call down fire on these people for
[57:11] rejecting the
[57:12] message?" Jesus said, "You don't even
[57:14] know what spirit you're of. I didn't
[57:16] come to bring judgment this time. I come
[57:18] to bring life and mercy. Praise God."
[57:20] But see, God had to let the church go
[57:22] through contraction. Judgment. Oh, they
[57:24] didn't receive me. I'm upset. I'm angry.
[57:28] I want God to judge them. That was a
[57:30] contraction because God is bringing
[57:32] forth a church. He's bringing forth a
[57:34] baby. Hallelujah. That's right. And
[57:37] brotherly kindness church, they argued
[57:39] about who is the greatest. Like Simon
[57:41] preached on Wednesday night. Divisions
[57:44] in the church. I'm of Apollos. I'm of
[57:46] Peter. I'm of Paul. I'm of Jesus.
[57:48] They're arguing about who's the
[57:50] greatest. And that grieved the Holy
[57:52] Spirit. But it was a contraction trying
[57:54] to get the church to come to who she is.
[57:56] Hallelujah.
[57:58] And then church on that blessed day of
[58:00] Pentecost, they finally got in one
[58:02] accord. They finally started worrying
[58:04] about who's greatest and who's going to
[58:06] sit where and let's judge everybody.
[58:08] What's we should hate these people. They
[58:09] got rid of all that through what? Prayer
[58:11] and
[58:13] meditation. 10 days of prayer,
[58:15] meditation, and pretty soon, I wonder
[58:17] where the first fire appeared. Brother
[58:18] Claude Patrick, I wonder where the first
[58:20] fire appeared. But pretty soon, somebody
[58:22] looked and said, "Oh, there's a fire
[58:23] over brother Peter. Oh, there's a fire.
[58:25] Oh, there's one over me." And they
[58:27] started praising God. What was it? God
[58:29] had brought forth the church. The church
[58:31] was coming forth. And they were uh they
[58:34] the church was was seen. And now the
[58:36] church is alive. And everybody can see
[58:38] new life has come forth. They didn't
[58:40] stay there. They went out in the streets
[58:41] praising God because they had a new
[58:43] life. They had joy for the spiritual
[58:46] baptism of the birth.
[58:48] Hallelujah. Oh my my goodness. God put
[58:52] up with all Peter's denies. Denied
[58:54] Christ three times.
[58:56] God put up with that
[58:58] sin. All the disciples forsook him and
[59:01] fled like sheep
[59:03] scattered. God was Jesus was forgotten
[59:06] about. Jesus was spoken against. And
[59:07] Peter said, "I never even knew him."
[59:10] What was that? That was a contraction.
[59:12] It's something the church had to go
[59:14] through until God brought forth
[59:16] deliverance. Until God brought forth new
[59:18] life. Church, if you need new life,
[59:20] Jesus is here today. Praise God. Let's
[59:23] stand to our feet. Hallelujah.
[59:27] Amen. A mother's compassion on the son
[59:31] of her womb. Praise
[59:34] God. Let's bow our heads here today.
