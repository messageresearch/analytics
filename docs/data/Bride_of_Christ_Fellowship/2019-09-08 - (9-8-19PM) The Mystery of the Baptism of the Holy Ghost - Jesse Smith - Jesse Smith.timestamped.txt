[21:29] I kind of fell that to go and wasn't
[21:33] really sure why but I went and I see got
[21:37] throughout the whole trip and then I
[21:39] came back and I was like really happy
[21:41] and that last week there is some special
[21:44] meeting and then then that's when it hit
[21:47] me why I went for those trip because
[21:49] that was preparing my heart so I can
[21:52] hear from him for last weekend so it's
[21:56] been a glorious weeks so it was gay and
[22:00] and the second testimony was like Marco

[31:41] hallelujah on the mystery of the baptism
[31:46] of the Holy Ghost it's just gonna be a
[31:48] real simple message so let's just open
[31:50] up and then at the end I'll share some
[31:51] testimonies from the meetings last
[31:54] weekend so if you would let's go to just
[31:58] Colossians chapter 1 very familiar
[31:59] scripture for us about the mystery of
[32:02] the Baptist and Holy Ghost
[32:03] Colossians 1:25 so I basically just want
[32:06] to show tonight some quotes from brother
[32:07] Branham about the new birth and the
[32:14] baptism and then Lord willing it hope
[32:18] it'll be a blessing and help everybody
[32:20] to understand it by God's grace it's
[32:22] quite it can be quite confusing so it
[32:27] was a good question I was very happy for
[32:29] the question and I don't know if I've
[32:30] ever preached it before as a separate
[32:32] sermon so I'm glad it was asked to me
[32:35] and then I would like to just give a
[32:39] really clear answer if I can tonight
[32:42] cautions 125
[32:47] so as you're turning there the the short
[32:51] answer is that before the seals brother
[32:53] branham called him he called a new birth
[32:55] and the baptism two separate things
[32:57] after the seals it was all one in the
[32:59] same so I just want to show a few quotes
[33:02] so the people so everybody can
[33:03] understand that and then that clears up
[33:06] any confusion about that you find that
[33:09] with a lot of doctrines you know before
[33:11] the seals brother Branham may have had a
[33:13] different idea or a different thought
[33:14] but then after the seals it gets cleared
[33:17] up so we thank the Lord for progressive
[33:20] revelation and that in itself proves
[33:23] that God was revealing things because
[33:25] the Bible said he does nothing except he
[33:27] reveals a secret to his servant the
[33:28] Prophet right so if nothing else it
[33:31] proves that that brother Branham had to
[33:33] grow in his understanding as God
[33:35] revealed it to him
[33:36] so Colossians 1:25 where of I am made a
[33:40] minister according to the dispensation
[33:42] of God which is given to me for you see
[33:45] his ministry was for them to fulfill the
[33:48] Word of God let's read verse 26 together
[33:52] one two three even the mystery which
[33:55] hath been hid from ages and from
[33:57] generations but now has made manifest to
[34:01] his Saints and I'll read 27 just myself
[34:03] to whom god would make known what is the
[34:05] riches of the glory of this mystery
[34:08] among the gentiles which is christ in
[34:11] you the hope of glory let's just have
[34:14] one word of prayer and ask the Lord to
[34:15] help us and I hope this is okay for
[34:18] tonight I just thought I'd lay it in
[34:19] there and I thought well if one person
[34:22] had a question maybe more people had
[34:23] questions I just want to get this
[34:24] covered here Heavenly Father we bow our
[34:27] heads Lord to you great eternal one
[34:30] living God living spirit oh god the only
[34:34] true God we just bow to you we love you
[34:36] Lord we love to sing your songs we want
[34:38] to love you more serve you more I don't
[34:40] do all those things Lord as we sang
[34:41] about know you more I Lou your worship
[34:44] you more help us here tonight lord help
[34:46] me to get out of your way Lord I may
[34:48] just speak and help the people Lord here
[34:50] tonight and we thank you for the word of
[34:52] God this morning and the songs we could
[34:54] sing this morning and tonight just
[34:55] continue to feed us here with your word
[34:57] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[34:59] said
[35:00] Amen god bless you'd be in situ praise
[35:01] God you know water sister this one's not
[35:06] open you need it that's alright just
[35:11] been sitting there I think someone gave
[35:14] it to all the preachers and I never used
[35:16] it so that's uh let's look here tonight
[35:18] I do have some quotes Lydia I'm gonna uh
[35:22] I just want to answer that question it's
[35:28] a really good question I got it on
[35:29] Monday I'm just calling it the mystery
[35:32] of the baptism like oh it's just real
[35:34] simple thought here I'm just gonna start
[35:37] off with this you know this is a picture
[35:39] that Ron malabo did from the Philippines
[35:41] he's in his 50s now but he's been a
[35:43] really faithful message preacher for
[35:44] about 30 years and so he shows us before
[35:48] the seals you know even before the seals
[35:51] brother Branham taught that you know the
[35:52] spirit was the innermost part and then
[35:55] the soul was like the next outer part in
[35:58] the body but after the seals brother
[36:00] Branham did have it he did switch it and
[36:02] correct it so this had a lot to do with
[36:05] you know how brother Branham would call
[36:07] the new birth and the baptism different
[36:09] things and this is another example of
[36:11] how God straightened him out on it and
[36:13] it it's just it's so wonderful to see
[36:16] how God can correct a man and brother
[36:18] BAM never went back and said I'm sorry
[36:20] and I apologize now if I make a mistake
[36:23] and I'm here all the time
[36:24] I won't apologize to you if I make a
[36:26] mistake okay but he was traveling so
[36:29] much you know God was giving him so many
[36:30] different great revelations let me go
[36:33] pull this up just it's on my mind so I
[36:35] don't forget
[36:35] here's the quote where brother Branham
[36:37] said he was like a jellyfish this is
[36:41] from 56 a secondhand robe sometimes I
[36:44] look at myself and I think I've been
[36:46] such a jellyfish in my life I've waited
[36:49] and missed many thousands of souls into
[36:51] the kingdom because I've weighed and
[36:52] said God depended too much on a spear
[36:56] this morning he was leaning too heavily
[36:59] on the gift remember he was leaning so
[37:01] heavily on it that he said I challenge
[37:03] he said bring the most challenging cases
[37:05] up here and let's pray for them first so
[37:08] brother BAM he kind of got in trouble
[37:09] with the angel for that too he was
[37:11] promising them every miracle he said
[37:13] bring the heart
[37:14] miracles and the angel told him Jesus
[37:16] never did that now Church look at this
[37:20] he missed many souls but listen at the
[37:23] same time if those souls were
[37:25] predestined to salvation they would have
[37:26] got at some other time right so is that
[37:31] you know brother Branham can't be a son
[37:33] of God and then be guilty of missing
[37:35] souls to hell like he can't be because
[37:37] there's no condemnation that are in
[37:39] Christ Jesus so maybe he misses
[37:41] opportunity but God would send another
[37:43] opportunity those souls to see that's
[37:46] how we have to understand it because
[37:47] we're not going to get to heaven and
[37:49] God's gonna say now look you failed hear
[37:50] hear hear hear hear the Bible said he's
[37:53] placed your sins in the sea of
[37:54] forgetfulness
[37:55] he forgot all about it and then Jesus
[37:57] promises all that the father's giving me
[37:59] will come so church that's something we
[38:02] need to remember too even if we miss
[38:04] witnessing or even minute if we miss you
[38:06] know reaching out to somebody God will
[38:09] be merciful and if that person is meant
[38:10] to be saved God is gonna save them likes
[38:13] I ever tell you this remember when I
[38:17] prayed for my friend's dad who had a
[38:19] stroke and was in the hospital member
[38:20] that and I spoke the word in the clause
[38:22] and I said Lord if you raise this man up
[38:24] in the name of Jesus Christ I said I
[38:27] speak to that ever was I said I will
[38:29] witness the message to him well God
[38:33] healed him and I've I called him up and
[38:35] I said can I tell you about the message
[38:36] and I start tell him about it he said
[38:38] well how did William Branham die and I
[38:41] told him William Branham died in a car
[38:43] accident by drunk drivers and the man
[38:47] said I asked God to forgive him but he
[38:50] said well I guess he didn't see God's
[38:52] vision that Diggs I was telling him how
[38:53] God came brother man visions and church
[38:57] it just deflated me I was instantly like
[38:59] and I felt like I failed the Lord and
[39:01] then he want to talk about other things
[39:03] you know and I was trying I fulfill my
[39:06] vow to God I brought the message and I
[39:08] said God has restored through a prophet
[39:09] and God gave me visions all the time I
[39:11] said God saw or gave him the vision of
[39:13] rock and roll but when it came to that
[39:16] question he turned it down and it made
[39:19] me feel like a failure but the thing is
[39:23] I tried I really tried with all of my
[39:26] heart and so I want you to see that too
[39:28] that even I try I promise to God I'll do
[39:30] something I'll do it but then even when
[39:32] I do it like if that person is not
[39:34] predestiny to be bribed they're not
[39:35] going to receive it instead of instead
[39:38] of being encouraged by William Branham
[39:39] they criticize William Branham well how
[39:41] come you didn't criticize William
[39:42] Branham when you finally believed see
[39:45] because you were a predestinated seed
[39:46] you were ordained of God right and God
[39:50] knew that so I just want to share with
[39:52] you that I can understand this sometimes
[39:54] I and I was so deflated I well I'm
[39:56] almost cried I was so sad on the phone
[39:58] I'm like man I made all this extra time
[39:59] to call him and you don't need a just
[40:02] once they kind of make fun of brother
[40:03] Branham you know but he said I've missed
[40:06] many thousands souls cuz I waited and
[40:08] depended too much on a gift I said Lord
[40:10] if you will just show me if you're just
[40:12] giving me a vision what to do and God
[40:14] gives a vision then I'll turn around and
[40:16] let somebody talk me into something else
[40:19] yeah I mean the closest we can get to
[40:22] that is seeing a dream like God could
[40:24] give us a dream and we could see what
[40:26] God wants us to do and then not do it
[40:28] that's the closest we could understand
[40:29] but here God shows him a vision and he
[40:32] turns it down he lets somebody talk him
[40:34] out of the vision praise God I just want
[40:37] to encourage you with that as we looked
[40:40] at gifts are important right we must be
[40:42] faithful with them but even when we fail
[40:44] in them what does God even when we
[40:46] depend too much on and what's God gonna
[40:48] do he's gonna straighten us out down the
[40:49] road now most of us is probably not like
[40:53] this we don't pray we probably don't to
[40:55] depend too much on gifts is probably
[40:57] that we don't use them enough right
[40:58] because we're not praying as much as we
[41:00] need to at times but you know God is
[41:01] merciful to us he'll guide us along but
[41:04] I just want to encourage you with this
[41:05] that he felt like a jellyfish God could
[41:07] show people of certain things and they
[41:10] still won't do it and so we can relate
[41:12] to that right so I can relate to a man
[41:14] like this that's why I love about
[41:16] brother Branham I can't relate he's a
[41:17] man he struggled but he also got victory
[41:20] at times - amen
[41:21] so I want to show that to you that I
[41:23] hope that was a blessing I there's
[41:25] numerous quotes like that where he says
[41:28] I'm ashamed of my faith I should have
[41:29] mountain-moving faith he says but I
[41:31] don't and pray for me you know yeah
[41:33] there's numerous quotes I found on that
[41:34] lately now I just want to show you the
[41:36] confusing there the confusion about some
[41:39] of the quotes there's six quotes like
[41:41] this where
[41:42] Ram said the new birth is not the
[41:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost so this was in
[41:46] 62 now look all the way up right before
[41:48] 63 I'll just read the whole thing
[41:51] remember I believe Martin Luther had the
[41:53] Holy Spirit absolutely maybe not in the
[41:55] portion is today because it wasn't given
[41:56] out we've been through that you people
[41:58] the tabernacle here on the blackboard
[41:59] but he did believe to God and he that
[42:01] believeth has everlasting life I never
[42:03] thought there was a person believed like
[42:04] this till I hurt till this morning I
[42:06] heard Charles fuller as I was going down
[42:08] he believes too that the new birth is
[42:10] not the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[42:13] new birth is being born the Holy Ghost
[42:15] is the baptism all right so this is the
[42:19] one that this is their six quotes like
[42:21] this where it makes it seem like well
[42:24] what is the baptism if it's not the new
[42:26] birth what is it so there's six that say
[42:29] this and they're from 1957 to 1962 let
[42:33] me just drop a little bomb on your on
[42:34] your heads here - because it was a bomb
[42:36] dropped on my head
[42:37] did you know brother I am called the
[42:38] Holy Spirit the third person the Trinity
[42:40] all the way up to 1962 look up look type
[42:45] in third person of the Trinity brother
[42:48] Branham call of the Holy Spirit the
[42:50] third person of the Trinity all the way
[42:51] up till right before he preached the
[42:53] church I'm sorry 1960 right before the
[42:55] church ages and then God showed him
[42:57] right before the church ages that he
[42:59] wasn't three he remember that mission
[43:00] where the three rainbows became one God
[43:05] showed in my vision and then he comes to
[43:06] the church ages and he says God's not
[43:08] three persons we see as divinity in
[43:11] Revelation chapter one he said it's one
[43:13] God in three offices just think about
[43:16] that from and I found quotes from 1951
[43:19] to 1960s over nine years he said three
[43:22] person third person Trinity second verse
[43:24] of the Trinity see he was growing in
[43:29] grace and knowledge of the Lord see and
[43:32] then the next year 1961 he says thus
[43:35] saith the Lord
[43:35] trinitarianism is of the devil he said
[43:38] about its time he said those people can
[43:40] still be saved but it's time that
[43:41] they're sincerely wrong and we got to
[43:43] tell him in that striking see they can
[43:47] go see him so these things like this
[43:49] they never stumble me because I realize
[43:51] brother Branham is not the absolute if
[43:53] brother Branham is your absolute you
[43:54] have some crazy
[43:55] try to finagle through the Bible right
[44:00] you got the white horse being both the
[44:02] Antichrist and the Holy Spirit I don't
[44:04] know how you're gonna pull that one off
[44:05] because they're totally contrary one to
[44:07] another then you got the new birth is
[44:10] different from the baptism then you got
[44:12] Jesus is the third person but he's the
[44:14] one person well you got some big
[44:16] problems if you make William brand the
[44:18] absolute but thank god he's not thank
[44:20] God Jesus Christ is the absolute amen so
[44:24] he said this about the new birth and the
[44:27] baptism for about you know five years
[44:30] now here's the revelation after the
[44:33] seals and like I said I just I don't
[44:34] want to make this too long of a study
[44:35] because there's not much to it once you
[44:38] really get down to it as far as
[44:40] scriptural so he received the revelation
[44:43] now here's here's where he says that
[44:45] plainly in the church age book it is
[44:47] stated plainly in the church age book so
[44:50] I don't know if I don't know how much
[44:53] you've read the church age book I know I
[44:54] preached on it a couple years ago but
[44:58] like I said there's it's the second
[45:00] greatest book outside the Bible is the
[45:02] church age book if you got any doctrinal
[45:03] questions start there and give yourself
[45:06] just devote yourself to read that book
[45:08] and that will just route route you and
[45:10] ground you in the love of God so when I
[45:12] invite those who are spirit filled to
[45:14] come and deal with those who have
[45:16] answered the invitation to receive the
[45:17] spirit these dear ones surge forward and
[45:20] deal with the people in such a manner as
[45:22] to encourage them to yield to God and
[45:24] believe to speak in tongues this has
[45:26] caused a great deal of confusion and I
[45:29] want you to tell you exactly what I mean
[45:31] I mean for the sinner to come forward
[45:33] and be born again which is to be
[45:35] baptized in the body of Christ by the
[45:37] Holy Ghost which is exactly what took
[45:39] place at Pentecost when the church was
[45:42] launched in other words to be born of
[45:44] the Spirit is to be truly baptized with
[45:47] the Holy Ghost it is one in the same so
[45:51] see Pentecostal people thought well
[45:52] here's what he says Pentecostal people
[45:58] yeah I thought they were
[45:59] saved and then believed to speak in
[46:01] tongues that's what they were thinking
[46:04] right they thought okay now we got to
[46:06] give him to speak in tongues and and get
[46:08] the baptism they got the new birth there
[46:10] in other words they're saved but they
[46:11] need to speak in tongues to have the
[46:13] baptism that's what the the tongues
[46:15] people were saying but brother I'm
[46:16] saying no I'm not saying that I'm saying
[46:18] they're saved but if they wanted the
[46:20] Baptist and Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[46:22] the same as a new birth now the next
[46:24] quote this is the continuing quote what
[46:28] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is
[46:31] the spirit baptizing you into the body
[46:33] of Christ it is the new birth it is the
[46:37] Spirit of God coming in and filling you
[46:39] after you've repented having heard his
[46:41] word and been baptized in water as an
[46:43] answer of a good conscience toward God
[46:46] all right so that's that's chapter four
[46:49] of the church age book if you want to
[46:50] dig into that it's a great revelation
[46:52] but the RAM in there says and I preached
[46:54] it here a couple years ago over in that
[46:56] sanctuary well Graham says if we want if
[46:58] we want the truth on the Holy Ghost we
[47:00] got to have thus saith the Lord and he
[47:02] says it's not according to me it's
[47:03] according to God's Word so we have we
[47:06] have thus saith the Lord because it's a
[47:07] mystery of God and where the RAM had to
[47:09] finish all the mysteries of God amen
[47:11] I'm gonna use that in the next book - by
[47:13] God's grace that's the next chapter I'm
[47:14] gonna write hopefully I'll get to that
[47:15] this week all right now here's another
[47:21] one yeah now here this is after the
[47:24] seals right this is five months after
[47:25] the seals in paradox and now he's using
[47:27] new birth and baptism interchangeably so
[47:30] something happened the but when Robyn
[47:32] was right when he said it became a new
[47:33] Bible God took the seals off I mean he
[47:36] took now it's made clear now we know
[47:39] God's one person now we know what the
[47:41] bats Holy Ghost is now we know tongues
[47:42] isn't evidence amen although he never
[47:44] believed that you know but it wasn't
[47:46] something separate you know it wasn't
[47:48] wasn't required you know so here we see
[47:51] I believe each one of you Methodist
[47:53] Presbyterian Lutheran that has never had
[47:55] experience the baptism Holy Spirit was
[47:57] in some formal church that did not
[47:59] believe in the genuine new birth and has
[48:01] now received the batson Holy Ghost is a
[48:03] perfect example of a paradox see how
[48:06] it's one of the same the baptism the new
[48:09] birth and the baptism Holy Ghost all the
[48:11] same thing here he says it
[48:13] plainly as well in the token at the end
[48:15] of the year when God gave you the true
[48:17] baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life
[48:20] of Jesus Christ is within you now that's
[48:22] true and everything lotion we'll have to
[48:23] admit that to be yes sir it's the new
[48:25] birth you're born the new of the Holy
[48:27] Ghost and because that God has did this
[48:29] and you know you're no good in yourself
[48:32] and you accept what God has did then he
[48:34] seals you and it was Kingdom by the Holy
[48:36] Spirit
[48:36] now that's clear yeah baptism new birth
[48:39] seal that's all the same thing
[48:41] amen praise God now see now the way God
[48:46] showed this to me was that God showed me
[48:49] there's only three parts to a person so
[48:51] the seal has to be on one of those three
[48:53] parts right so we have the body spirit
[48:57] and soul so it's got to be on one of
[48:59] those there's only three parts and just
[49:03] I'm just it's just the process of
[49:04] elimination the Holy Ghost cannot seal
[49:06] the flesh because anybody can
[49:08] impersonate the flesh you can put a seal
[49:10] or you can put a stamp on your body and
[49:12] anybody can do that but the Bible says
[49:14] in second is 4:16 the inward man is
[49:17] renewed day by day
[49:19] now that means that means it gets old
[49:20] and has to be made new every single day
[49:22] but the Bible says the seal is unto the
[49:26] day of redemption so if it so it can't
[49:28] be in the mind because the mind worried
[49:30] needs renewed every day and the Bible
[49:32] says the soul that sinneth it shall die
[49:34] so the one who doesn't receive Christ in
[49:36] the soul and rejects life in the soul
[49:39] that's the one that's separated from God
[49:41] so it has to be the soul so the seal of
[49:44] God the Bible doesn't say the seals in
[49:46] the soul but Jesus did say I'll give you
[49:48] the rest unto your souls how many number
[49:51] that so see it has to be in one of those
[49:53] that's why I keep going back to here
[49:54] Jesus said I'll give you rest in your
[49:56] soul
[49:57] see they David could get in the spirit
[49:59] he could prophesy right we'll get to
[50:00] that and they all can feel the anointing
[50:02] on the body Balaam felt that Balaam felt
[50:04] it in his mind but the soul is what God
[50:06] wanted to fill but he couldn't do it
[50:09] until all the sin was clearly purged and
[50:11] paid for on the cross praise God
[50:14] now see brother Brahim had a progressive
[50:16] revelation I didn't get to this but I
[50:17] wanted to show Abraham had this too and
[50:20] then like with Sarah Sarah Sarah wasn't
[50:23] even connected to the promise till God
[50:26] came and told Abraham about it
[50:27] change your name to Sarah from Sarah
[50:29] Siri I so I want to show that you know
[50:31] that's that was just my notes I think is
[50:33] a chance to get there but maybe next
[50:35] time by God's grace so the true
[50:37] revelation I already read that I just
[50:39] said copy the church age book portion
[50:40] it's one of the same brother branham
[50:42] caused it the capstone revelation so I
[50:44] read through that to you earlier he said
[50:46] the new birth the baptism is all it's
[50:48] one in the same it's all the same thing
[50:50] okay Paul calls in the mystery hid from
[50:52] the ages we read that earlier this
[50:55] mystery was hid
[50:56] she was hid from the Old Testament the
[50:59] fact that the fact that God was going to
[51:01] send a new birth in the soul of man that
[51:03] was hid it was like a hidden power
[51:05] praise God amen
[51:08] it's like this hidden I don't know it's
[51:11] like a hidden channel it's like it's
[51:13] like the whole time David knew he had
[51:15] another level he could get up to but he
[51:16] could never quite get there right Peter
[51:19] had a he always felt I could have a
[51:21] higher level I could go to but he
[51:22] couldn't get it until you went to
[51:24] Pentecost amen
[51:25] oh yeah he had all this zeal and all
[51:28] this desire but he could never get that
[51:30] power until he went to the day of
[51:32] Pentecost amen
[51:33] and that's what Jesus did for us Paul
[51:36] said God made known the mystery Christ
[51:38] in you the hope of glory now look at
[51:40] this in this beautiful he said in you
[51:42] Christ in you no look at this the same
[51:44] words in you is when Jesus talking about
[51:46] the comforter and I'll pray the father
[51:48] and he shall give you another comforter
[51:49] he may would buy with you how long
[51:51] forever forever he'll buy with you
[51:55] forever he says even the Spirit of Truth
[51:57] whom the world cannot receive because it
[51:59] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[52:01] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[52:03] shall be in you and that beautiful the
[52:05] Bible use the same words Christ in you
[52:07] and Jesus says the comforter in you
[52:10] praise God amen see deeper than the mind
[52:14] deeper than the human spirit it's got to
[52:16] go deeper than that and that's because
[52:17] our human spirit is just open it's like
[52:19] an open it's like an open lid right and
[52:26] that's our minds it's always open Satan
[52:29] can come up here and try to pour things
[52:30] in right even during service you can try
[52:32] to pour things in our mind Kenny
[52:33] I better not said there cuz it's gonna
[52:35] spill but Satan can come around and he
[52:38] can he can pour anything like that in
[52:39] our human spirit
[52:41] it's always open all right we got to be
[52:42] careful it gets into our minds but our
[52:45] soul is sealed so I can't put it on
[52:47] there by the one hand but you under the
[52:49] picture our soul with all would be
[52:51] sealed the cat would be snapped on there
[52:53] and it could be heated on there it could
[52:56] be sealed on there and then Satan sealed
[52:59] out unbelievers sealed out and faith is
[53:01] sealed in the presence of God there the
[53:04] life of God is sealed in the Bible also
[53:07] calls it quick and it gives us an
[53:08] example of a seed quicken it's made
[53:10] alive it's not in seed form anymore now
[53:13] it's in their life or now it's in the
[53:15] form of a growth amen
[53:16] now it's a growing living thing it's not
[53:19] just dormant it's alive its quickened
[53:21] and that's what the Holy Ghost is in you
[53:23] and I amen the spirit of truth amen the
[53:27] spirit of truth see and green not always
[53:30] beard of God whereby you're sealed unto
[53:32] that means until in the Greek you're
[53:34] sealed in until the day of redemption so
[53:38] there's no I I need a new baptism in my
[53:40] soul I need to refilling the Holy Ghost
[53:41] of my soul there's nothing for that how
[53:43] to tell people that at Albion - they
[53:45] wanted a refilling I said well it's not
[53:46] gonna be in your soul alls it is it's a
[53:49] it's a restoration of your mind you've
[53:51] let your mind get too much in the things
[53:53] to the world and you're not fervent the
[53:55] Bible said we must be fervent in our
[53:57] spirits see we got to be boiling and our
[54:00] thoughts always got to stay on the
[54:01] things of God but Satan tries to cool
[54:04] off our boiler right he tries to turn
[54:06] down your fire on your stove so you
[54:09] don't boil for Christ's right you're not
[54:10] thinking about Christ all week you're
[54:11] not excited about we're not excited
[54:13] about the things of God he tries to turn
[54:15] off your fire but you got to keep the
[54:16] fire burning in your mind constantly
[54:19] I've seen it many times
[54:20] constantly meditate on the things of God
[54:23] don't we have to do that hallelujah see
[54:27] we got to be fervent in our minds and I
[54:31] want to let me just share this example
[54:32] you know I like YouTube you know we have
[54:35] a ministry on YouTube and I get a lot of
[54:37] good stuff off YouTube I'm really
[54:38] inspired by preachers on YouTube I
[54:39] really enjoy it it's a good way for me
[54:41] to feed on other things like when I'm
[54:44] not listening brother branham but
[54:45] there's been times I've got just tired
[54:47] of my flesh and I've caught myself on
[54:49] YouTube I'm just scrolling scrolling I'm
[54:52] just scrolling
[54:54] because when it comes down to it nothing
[54:56] those things can really never satisfy
[54:59] right and then it's striking I'll put on
[55:02] a sermon to brother Brandon and my spear
[55:03] just lifts like that like I mean good
[55:06] things learn about computers learn about
[55:08] how morning routine how to exercise I
[55:12] mean good things I'm trying to do good
[55:14] things but I realize after a while it
[55:17] doesn't give life but honestly as soon
[55:19] as I soon as I turn brother Brandon I
[55:20] can feel my spirit reignited and I found
[55:25] that YouTube can't give that I mean lost
[55:28] it's up serve a really anointed sermon
[55:30] you know what I mean so all and what I'm
[55:32] saying is that good things doesn't renew
[55:34] your mind when you're trying to I'm
[55:36] trying to make a better how do I invest
[55:38] better how do I do this or how do I save
[55:40] or what should I which car should I buy
[55:41] next you know whatever those things are
[55:45] good but they will never satisfy our
[55:47] minds have to be on fire with the things
[55:49] of God and that's why I've seen that
[55:51] renewing the renewing in the spirit of
[55:54] your mind I couldn't get back to I guess
[55:55] I must have passed it too far it's the
[55:58] renewing in your spirit of mine I've
[56:00] seen that the things of the world that
[56:02] they don't fulfill they dumb satisfy
[56:04] only the Word of God satisfies so if you
[56:07] need a refilling in your spirit then you
[56:09] got to go devote all your attention to
[56:11] listening to the Word of God and singing
[56:14] worshiping praising God
[56:15] listening brother Branham and then
[56:18] you'll see that because that's how I see
[56:19] it - I see it just read Knights my fire
[56:21] praise God because we all get tired we
[56:23] all we all get like jellyfish sometime
[56:26] don't we write in our minds now I want
[56:30] to go back here now I'm going to show
[56:32] you something that's I hope you
[56:34] understand this I really hope you
[56:36] understand this guy I don't want to
[56:36] confuse anybody but when I want to show
[56:39] you that the baptism Holy Ghost is such
[56:41] a mystery that there was even hid from
[56:44] the writers of the lexicon ok so what I
[56:47] mean by that is that the words filled
[56:49] and baptized can be used interchangeably
[56:52] so in other words you won't get the
[56:56] revelation by going to the Greek now you
[56:58] can for some things like member and more
[57:00] phase ever everyone remember in more
[57:02] faith God changes masks right and bran
[57:04] uses the Greek word and more faith now
[57:06] that's beautiful
[57:07] gives a revelation that God it wasn't a
[57:10] second person in Christ but the first
[57:12] person the only person he just changes
[57:14] masks right in more faith so we can get
[57:18] the revelation from the lexicon there
[57:20] but when it comes to the baptism the
[57:21] Holy Ghost you can't get it from the
[57:23] lexicon let me show it to you i i'ma
[57:25] show you sure why because the Greek
[57:27] words for filled and baptized doesn't
[57:29] work every time okay so I'm trying to
[57:33] make this plain I don't want to confuse
[57:34] your church I hope I hope I'm not and if
[57:37] you have questions just please text me
[57:38] or email me or talk to me afterwards
[57:40] okay here's what I mean
[57:42] for he John the Baptist shall be great
[57:45] in the sight of the Lord and shall drink
[57:46] neither wine nor strong drink and he
[57:49] shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even
[57:50] from his mother's womb how many knew
[57:52] that he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[57:55] in the mother's womb but not in the soul
[57:59] because that couldn't be given yet
[58:01] because Jesus was not glorified yet
[58:03] in other words that little baby already
[58:08] it's minor spirit was anointed with the
[58:10] things of God I'll explain that but hey
[58:15] there's nothing too hard for our God I
[58:17] just said like that there is nothing too
[58:19] difficult for the Lord
[58:21] see when God's got a child and he's
[58:24] gonna use that child for a special
[58:26] purpose God can even fill their minds
[58:28] with the Holy Ghost even before they can
[58:29] talk that's that's the Word of God
[58:32] Church it's hard to explain that's the
[58:35] Word of God
[58:35] now here's what I mean - later on the
[58:38] same chapter it came to pass that when
[58:39] Elizabeth heard the citation of Mary the
[58:41] babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth
[58:42] was filled with the Holy Ghost so John
[58:47] the Baptist hears the name Jesus and his
[58:49] mind is so anointed that he leaps and he
[58:52] starts to rejoice and just to hear the
[58:53] name of Jesus now what should we do if
[58:55] we hear the name of Jesus we should say
[58:57] glory right if a baby's got the
[59:01] anointing on its mind and can leap at
[59:03] the name of Jesus we should be excited
[59:05] too about the name of Jesus what see
[59:08] Elizabeth now gets filled but I like
[59:11] this look she spoke with a loud voice
[59:14] see because the Holy Ghost brings
[59:16] boldness but member this is only in the
[59:19] human spirit
[59:21] because Jesus has not yet died all those
[59:24] Saints are still in the heart of the
[59:25] earth and Satan has got kept them in
[59:27] bondage they're still captives right oh
[59:28] but he's gonna lead captivity captive
[59:31] into his will hey man all right I'm
[59:34] almost done I'm not going to too long so
[59:37] see the word failed and the Greek means
[59:39] to be filled up right she was filled
[59:42] John the Baptist was filled in this
[59:43] human spirit and so was Elizabeth now
[59:46] baptized in the Holy Ghost in acts 1:5
[59:49] jesus said I'll baptize you with the
[59:51] Holy Ghost
[59:51] it means baptize now look this word
[59:53] though does is a little different but
[59:55] it's also interchangeable I hope I can
[59:58] explain now this is the lexicon the word
[1:00:01] baptize means to overwhelm not to be
[1:00:03] confused with another word bapto the
[1:00:06] clearest example that shows the meaning
[1:00:07] of baptizo is a text from the greek poet
[1:00:10] and physician nic and ER we lived about
[1:00:12] 200 BC it's a recipe for making pickles
[1:00:15] so did you ever think pickles would help
[1:00:16] you understand the baptism holy ghost my
[1:00:18] wife might be able to cuz she's made
[1:00:19] pickles but I don't think I watched her
[1:00:21] so honey have to explain it to me later
[1:00:24] so pickles can help you understand the
[1:00:26] baptism the Holy Ghost it's helpful
[1:00:29] because it uses both words Nicator says
[1:00:31] that in order to make a pickle the
[1:00:33] vegetable should first be dipped or
[1:00:35] bapto into boiling water but then
[1:00:37] baptized in the vinegar solution both
[1:00:42] verbs contain the immersing of
[1:00:43] vegetables in a solution but the first
[1:00:45] is temporary the second act of baptizing
[1:00:49] the vegetable produces a permanent
[1:00:50] change is that right honey does that is
[1:00:53] that the same as your experience okay
[1:00:57] but there's other ways right there you
[1:01:00] go all right well thank you she's she's
[1:01:04] made some good pickles too I know
[1:01:05] there's some jars in there I still got
[1:01:06] to eat honey so remind me when we get
[1:01:08] home I need to eat those jars I forget
[1:01:11] to eat those pickles I like pickles when
[1:01:14] uses the New Testament this word more
[1:01:16] often refers to our union so the word
[1:01:18] baptized refers to our union and
[1:01:21] identification with Christ then to our
[1:01:23] water baptism mark 16:16 he that
[1:01:27] believes in baptized shall be saved
[1:01:29] Christ is saying that mere intellectual
[1:01:34] assent is not
[1:01:35] enough there must be a union with him a
[1:01:37] real change like the vegetable to the
[1:01:40] pickle right so pickle when it's change
[1:01:44] is fully changed it's not going back to
[1:01:46] vegetable right it's gonna stay a pickle
[1:01:49] so that's the point from the Greek word
[1:01:51] from the lexicon but here Church here's
[1:01:54] where this is the same Greek word so the
[1:01:56] word filled is the same word fill now
[1:01:58] listen if you know the Bible were they
[1:02:01] filled in the spear or soul in acts 2:4
[1:02:04] soul this is soul see they were filled
[1:02:07] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:02:09] with other tongues as the Spirit gave
[1:02:10] them utterance okay so the same greek
[1:02:15] word here for elizabeth being filled
[1:02:16] before the cross is the same greek word
[1:02:20] here that's why I said that this mystery
[1:02:22] was so great it was hid from the lexicon
[1:02:23] writers it was so great it was hid from
[1:02:27] brother Branham until 1963 but then God
[1:02:30] showed it to him and then he preached it
[1:02:32] faithfully the rest of his ministry so
[1:02:35] see it's the same Greek word for filled
[1:02:37] she was filled now they're filled so the
[1:02:40] mysteries hidden from a lexicon authors
[1:02:42] as well the lexicon is not the absolute
[1:02:44] God's revelation is the absolute right
[1:02:47] the revelation of the word is the
[1:02:49] absolute like someone might say well no
[1:02:51] brother just the words the absolute
[1:02:52] Matthew 28:19 we should baptize father
[1:02:55] son Holy Ghost that's the absolute well
[1:02:56] no it's the revelation of Matthew 28:19
[1:02:58] right so see it's the revelation of the
[1:03:03] Word of God that's the absolute now I
[1:03:06] don't I don't I'm not gonna get
[1:03:07] technical with with us with that but I
[1:03:09] would if somebody gave me that argument
[1:03:11] right because we when I say the
[1:03:13] revelation is the word you understand
[1:03:15] that right you understand I mean the
[1:03:17] revelation God gave to brother Branham
[1:03:19] of the interpretation of the Bible
[1:03:21] I'm not gonna use that with all of us
[1:03:23] cuz you know you know that but I might
[1:03:25] use it with someone who doesn't believe
[1:03:26] okay cuz I want to get too technical but
[1:03:29] at the same time this is what even
[1:03:32] Jeffersonville says this - they said
[1:03:33] it's God's revelation is more important
[1:03:37] than the written word because you know
[1:03:39] they they use the quote brother BAM said
[1:03:40] God speaks between the lines you know
[1:03:42] with Abraham and Sarah turning young
[1:03:43] again so they use that quote but they
[1:03:47] use it too far to make
[1:03:48] every word he said thus say at the Lord
[1:03:52] so it's a great it's a great battle but
[1:03:55] we're in this battle to the end praise
[1:03:57] God and when we've got God's word we can
[1:03:59] sit on every promise of God and we can
[1:04:01] defeat every foe praise the Lord it's
[1:04:03] the battle worth fighting I'm almost
[1:04:05] done here let me see okay yeah I think I
[1:04:07] go through this pretty fast now let's go
[1:04:12] to this real quick and I'll come back
[1:04:14] here this is a this is an important
[1:04:17] scripture in the last day the great day
[1:04:19] of the feast Jesus stood and cried I
[1:04:21] look he cries he Jesus was a hard
[1:04:23] preacher right he was soft at times but
[1:04:25] then he used a lot of emotion he cried
[1:04:26] out saying if any man thirst let him
[1:04:29] come unto me and drink
[1:04:30] I believe that's what he's saying today
[1:04:31] don't you I believe he says that through
[1:04:34] the bride cuz the spirit and the bride
[1:04:35] say come they're saying come if you're
[1:04:38] thirsty come he that believeth on me as
[1:04:42] the scripture has said out of his belly
[1:04:43] shall flow rivers of living water this
[1:04:45] spake he of the Spirit which they that
[1:04:47] believe on him should receive for the
[1:04:49] Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[1:04:51] Jesus was not yet glorified okay so see
[1:04:55] we got to take this scripture the Holy
[1:04:56] Ghost is not given but yet John the
[1:04:58] Baptist had it Elizabeth had it and even
[1:05:00] his dad Zechariah had it he got filled
[1:05:04] with the Holy Ghost but the Bible says
[1:05:05] it wasn't given yet in the soul it
[1:05:08] wasn't given in the soul yet right it
[1:05:11] was only given in the human spirit okay
[1:05:14] now with that in mind now you can go to
[1:05:17] David and the Bible said Samuel took the
[1:05:20] Horn of oil and knowing to him in the
[1:05:22] midst of his brother and the spear Lord
[1:05:23] came upon David from that day forward
[1:05:25] but not every day right especially the
[1:05:28] days when he got caught with Bathsheba
[1:05:30] so samuel rose up and went to Rhema now
[1:05:33] look the spear Lord departed from Saul
[1:05:36] so see for them it wasn't a seal until
[1:05:39] the day of redemption it would come and
[1:05:42] go come and go and the evil spirit from
[1:05:46] the Lord troubled him that doesn't mean
[1:05:49] God's evil it means God needed someone
[1:05:51] to fulfill his plan for Saul's life
[1:05:54] because God knew Saul was gonna stumble
[1:05:56] anyway so just like you did with Ahab
[1:05:58] who will go before me and deceive them
[1:06:00] you know same type of thing
[1:06:02] so I wanted to have a bitterness against
[1:06:04] Davis so God said well what do you have
[1:06:06] to go so the evil spirit from the Lord
[1:06:08] troubled saw now here's a beautiful
[1:06:12] quote if you ever wonder if what I'm
[1:06:15] teaching about John 7 is right just go
[1:06:17] to spoken words original see David said
[1:06:19] thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[1:06:21] send out against you Lord
[1:06:22] only thing he needed was the rain so see
[1:06:26] brother man recognized that David didn't
[1:06:28] have the anointing we have today David
[1:06:31] would have been alright if he could just
[1:06:34] had that rain but the Holy Ghost was it
[1:06:37] yet given see that so see David would
[1:06:42] have been alright if he could just get
[1:06:43] born again the soul but it wasn't
[1:06:46] available to him about church but it's
[1:06:48] available to us that's why when people
[1:06:51] leave the message or I've had people
[1:06:52] have to counsel about adultery and
[1:06:54] different things like that when I hear
[1:06:56] about those things I know that persons
[1:06:57] not born again because David could do
[1:06:59] that before the Holy Ghost but not after
[1:07:01] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost seals that
[1:07:03] out of your life that's why the Holy
[1:07:05] Ghost was given to give you power over
[1:07:07] those kind of things that's right he had
[1:07:10] the word the Word was with him and he
[1:07:12] and he could know it he said I've hid it
[1:07:14] in my heart Lord I won't bloom out and
[1:07:16] act like it should
[1:07:17] I'm sorry it won't bloom out and act
[1:07:20] like I should but I've hid it there Lord
[1:07:22] I've hid there but when Jesus came which
[1:07:23] was the Word made manifest through the
[1:07:25] germ of life out of it and it brings it
[1:07:27] back to the word now and if David's
[1:07:30] grown over what are out ours to do sure
[1:07:33] without the spirit amen isn't he
[1:07:35] wonderful all right so see I'm trying
[1:07:38] I'm teaching at Wright Church I believe
[1:07:39] I am teaching it right by the grace of
[1:07:41] the Lord yeah because the david says
[1:07:47] created me a clean heart O God renew a
[1:07:48] right spirit within me so you need it
[1:07:49] renewed just like the human mind cast me
[1:07:52] not away from your presence and take not
[1:07:54] your Holy Spirit for me David knew what
[1:07:56] it was like to have the spirit taken
[1:07:57] from him praise God
[1:07:59] later on his ministry remember the Bible
[1:08:01] said Satan provoked David any number of
[1:08:04] the people and over 20,000 people died
[1:08:06] because he numbered the people
[1:08:07] Satan provoked him so see you can't have
[1:08:11] the anointing of God on you and then a
[1:08:12] Satan direct you to do something evil
[1:08:13] like that it's either one of the other
[1:08:16] right you can't have programs you don't
[1:08:18] have a black and white bird you don't
[1:08:19] have a drunk sober man
[1:08:20] if Satanists provoke David then Satan's
[1:08:24] anointing his thoughts and even Joab
[1:08:26] tried to warn me like don't number the
[1:08:28] people he's like imma do it anyway
[1:08:31] see cuz the Holy Spirit was taken from
[1:08:34] him because you know God knew that he
[1:08:37] wanted to make that sin you know he got
[1:08:39] new he wanted to do that so God has to
[1:08:41] let him do that God can't force him and
[1:08:42] do anything they says restore to me the
[1:08:45] joy of thy salvation and uphold me with
[1:08:48] thy free spirit and brother BAM always
[1:08:51] points it out
[1:08:51] he didn't say restore to the salvation
[1:08:55] he just said restore the joy of the
[1:08:56] salvation David always say right but he
[1:08:59] just lost the joy of it that's what we
[1:09:01] looked at a few weeks ago and preach on
[1:09:03] seasons sometimes we get it sometimes we
[1:09:05] lose it but we're still saved right he
[1:09:09] just lost the joy of it all right so I
[1:09:12] hope that is that helpful by God's grace
[1:09:14] nobody ever too can see that remember
[1:09:16] the Bible said the Lord departed from
[1:09:18] Samson he left him he left his spirit he
[1:09:22] left his flesh to see the Lord departed
[1:09:25] from him you remember this is one of my
[1:09:28] this is one of most powerful scriptures
[1:09:30] I've had in the last few years about
[1:09:31] Hezekiah remember he wanted to live 15
[1:09:35] more years and God said no you should
[1:09:37] actually God let him but God said it
[1:09:39] would have been better if you just died
[1:09:40] him when I told you to set your house in
[1:09:41] order but the Bible said that God I'm
[1:09:44] sorry that Babylon sent embassadors and
[1:09:47] inquired of the wonder that was done in
[1:09:49] the land God left Hezekiah to try him
[1:09:52] that he might know all that was in his
[1:09:55] heart
[1:09:55] now the Bible said God never leaves and
[1:09:58] surfers sakes us right in Hebrews
[1:10:00] chapter 13 I believe verse 5 God will
[1:10:03] never leave us or forsake us why is that
[1:10:04] different it's different because now God
[1:10:06] gets in your soul in the Old Testament
[1:10:09] he couldn't get in your soul he could
[1:10:10] leave you but now he can't leave you
[1:10:12] because he's in your soul praise God he
[1:10:14] seals his spirit into your soul I'll be
[1:10:16] with you even in you to the end of the
[1:10:18] age now here's where he he says it again
[1:10:23] to understand what I have just said is
[1:10:25] it clear up why students have never ever
[1:10:27] found Paul saying at any time
[1:10:29] be born again and then be spirit-filled
[1:10:32] you catch that Paul never said okay get
[1:10:35] born again and now get spirit-filled he
[1:10:37] never separated them they have inferred
[1:10:40] it is there and they have put their own
[1:10:41] meanings to make us say that but
[1:10:43] scripture does not say that Jesus never
[1:10:46] said it either and then he quotes John
[1:10:49] 7:37 239 well I just read earlier the
[1:10:54] Holy Ghost could not be given because
[1:10:55] Jesus was not glorified now here says
[1:10:58] distinctly and emphatically that the
[1:11:00] believer upon drinking by coming into
[1:11:02] Jesus in faith would have rivers of
[1:11:05] living waters pouring out of him and it
[1:11:07] places this experience at Pentecost amen
[1:11:11] almost done now today is a time of
[1:11:14] restoration by teaching this is what I
[1:11:18] preached on last Saturday morning over
[1:11:20] at Albion you know I've heard different
[1:11:21] people say we don't need teaching we
[1:11:23] don't need the mystery and we're too
[1:11:24] much on that we're too much on that the
[1:11:26] fact is you can't be too much on it if
[1:11:28] it's God's truth okay
[1:11:33] and I'll just try to show you a few
[1:11:35] quotes here brother Graham said what's
[1:11:40] to be done in the last days what's to
[1:11:41] reveal bring forth
[1:11:43] what's Malachi for to do to turn back
[1:11:44] the people from the stumbling block to
[1:11:46] break down the traditions and to reveal
[1:11:48] the bread with the Shekinah glory so the
[1:11:51] fresh bread of the word with God's glory
[1:11:53] watch it ripen and produce just exactly
[1:11:56] what it said it would do OMA the
[1:11:57] shewbread for this age to the
[1:11:59] denomination of stumbling Bock a bunch
[1:12:01] of fanatics but we who believe but now
[1:12:04] as revelation tenants promise all the
[1:12:06] mystery of God that's been in the pages
[1:12:08] down through them years would be ripens
[1:12:09] so see ripen brought forth in the age of
[1:12:12] the seventh angels message in other
[1:12:15] words the mysteries of God are the bread
[1:12:17] that we're feeding on in other words in
[1:12:20] other words you and I are in the holy
[1:12:22] place right now we're seeing the glory
[1:12:24] of the seven candlesticks and we're
[1:12:26] eating the mysteries of God in the holy
[1:12:28] place amen and then we go up in prayer
[1:12:31] and we pray and we can go in the
[1:12:33] presence of God to hear his voice but if
[1:12:35] we're not in there having that same
[1:12:37] communion you know hearing thus saith
[1:12:39] the lord of revelation then we're out
[1:12:41] here mario says were feasting all
[1:12:43] the bread the fresh ripened bread of the
[1:12:46] mysteries of God praise God what he say
[1:12:52] in Malachi 4 would restore restore back
[1:12:54] the original Pentecostal faith back to
[1:12:57] the people with the same Pentecostal
[1:12:58] message the same Pentecostal sign the
[1:13:01] same kind of causal evidence the same
[1:13:02] God the same power the same teaching
[1:13:05] everything exactly with the vindication
[1:13:07] of the same pillar of fire that struck
[1:13:09] down Paul on the road to down to
[1:13:10] Damascus amongst us today doing the same
[1:13:13] things that he did in that day
[1:13:14] uniting hey man here's the one I love
[1:13:18] he's talking about well I'll just read
[1:13:20] it this age started just after the turn
[1:13:21] of the 20th century talking about Azusa
[1:13:23] Street and it was to be the age in which
[1:13:25] the true church would return to being
[1:13:27] the bride she was a Pentecost we know
[1:13:28] that there must be an assessee be a
[1:13:30] return of dynamic power the believers
[1:13:33] sent this in their spirits and began
[1:13:34] crying to God for a new outpouring such
[1:13:36] as was in the first century what seemed
[1:13:38] to be the answer came as many began to
[1:13:40] speak in tongues and manifest gifts to
[1:13:42] the spirit it was then believed that
[1:13:44] this was indeed the long-awaited
[1:13:45] restoration it was not for the latter
[1:13:47] rain can come only after the former rain
[1:13:51] which is the spring or teaching rain now
[1:13:54] think about all these people that are
[1:13:55] saying all we don't need the teaching we
[1:13:57] don't need the mysteries the actual rain
[1:14:00] or anointing for this day is the
[1:14:02] teaching rain so if they're saying we
[1:14:05] don't want teaching they're saying we
[1:14:07] don't want the Holy Ghost anointing for
[1:14:08] today and now watch their lives watch
[1:14:12] their hunger for the word right because
[1:14:15] the anointing for today is the teaching
[1:14:17] because the latter rain is rapturing
[1:14:19] faith and that's to come it's not here
[1:14:22] yet remember the Bible said they'll fall
[1:14:24] at the same time amen
[1:14:25] so see we're receiving the former right
[1:14:28] now but one day it'll be both former and
[1:14:30] latter rain which will be more of the
[1:14:32] same anointing I believe that's right
[1:14:34] the latter rain that is harvest rain how
[1:14:36] could this be the real thing when the
[1:14:38] teaching rain had not come the Prophet
[1:14:40] messenger who has to be sent to teach
[1:14:42] the people and turn the hearts of the
[1:14:45] children back to the Pentecostal
[1:14:46] father's had not yet come see if people
[1:14:50] say they don't want
[1:14:50] there's too much teaching it's because
[1:14:52] they're not being anointed with the Holy
[1:14:54] Ghost for today because the Holy Ghost
[1:14:55] is teaching us
[1:14:56] to obey the Word of God amen now here's
[1:15:01] the one I read a couple weeks ago we
[1:15:03] need to read again whosoever
[1:15:04] transgresseth and abideth not in the
[1:15:07] doctrine of Christ hath not God
[1:15:09] he that abideth for the doctrine of
[1:15:11] Christ he hath both the father and son
[1:15:13] so see if somebody doesn't like doctrine
[1:15:16] it's because they're not born again
[1:15:19] because he who is born again he has the
[1:15:22] father and son that's the person that
[1:15:24] lives the doctrine loves the doctrine
[1:15:26] and likes teaching Amen you see that see
[1:15:30] if you don't have the doctrine you're
[1:15:32] not born you don't even have God you're
[1:15:33] not born again tell these people that
[1:15:36] say too much doctrine too much mysteries
[1:15:38] it's because they're not born again it's
[1:15:40] because they don't want instruction
[1:15:42] doctor means instruction they don't want
[1:15:44] they don't want to be instructed in
[1:15:46] other words they don't want God telling
[1:15:47] them what to do they just want to come
[1:15:49] to church think they're saved think
[1:15:51] they're going to rapture but they don't
[1:15:52] want to be told what their do by the
[1:15:53] Holy Spirit and especially not the
[1:15:55] fivefold ministry pastor don't tell me
[1:15:58] what to do what do you know well I only
[1:16:00] know what God speaks through me I don't
[1:16:01] really know nothing but if God speaking
[1:16:03] to us he's gonna speak through his word
[1:16:05] amen see so at no one can say well Oh
[1:16:09] too much doctor know when you've got the
[1:16:12] doctrine you've got Christ amen
[1:16:14] everybody see that if there come any
[1:16:18] unto you and bring not this doctrine
[1:16:19] receive him not into your house neither
[1:16:21] bid him Godspeed see how important
[1:16:22] doctrine is and you got a false doctrine
[1:16:25] you don't have Jesus Christ and then
[1:16:27] don't come in don't let that person come
[1:16:28] in your house for he that biddeth him
[1:16:31] God speed is partaker of his evil deeds
[1:16:33] now the way this works most of time is
[1:16:35] with the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses
[1:16:37] that go door to door if you're if you
[1:16:40] can't stand up against him don't let him
[1:16:41] in your house but I've let both in my
[1:16:44] house I really stood up to the Mormon I
[1:16:47] didn't really know what to say the
[1:16:48] jobless witnesses the one time because I
[1:16:49] didn't I didn't know what they were
[1:16:51] about I offered him brother Aaron Brooks
[1:16:53] but they turned it down so I vowed next
[1:16:55] time I'm not gonna let them in my house
[1:16:56] because I'll take their stuff and
[1:16:58] recycle it you know but they won't take
[1:17:00] my stuff right
[1:17:06] it's going right to the recycle bin but
[1:17:08] I'll at least flatter them see you
[1:17:10] because I want to show them I'm at least
[1:17:12] open and if I felt the presence of God
[1:17:15] I'd read that and if I didn't have those
[1:17:18] saith the Lord I'd read that but I've
[1:17:19] got thus saith the Lord I know what they
[1:17:22] believe
[1:17:23] you know I know so see now it's
[1:17:26] different
[1:17:27] I've got at least at least I'm a little
[1:17:29] bit humble to take it but they won't
[1:17:32] even take mine so I will let them in my
[1:17:34] house anymore but they haven't come to
[1:17:35] my house last time they came my wife
[1:17:37] shared about my mom being healed of
[1:17:39] cancer and they left pretty soon after
[1:17:41] that cuz they don't believe in
[1:17:42] supernatural oh where they basically
[1:17:44] believe we're in the middle millennium
[1:17:45] right now that's what they believe but I
[1:17:48] let the Mormons in and I knew where I
[1:17:50] knew right where they're going cuz I
[1:17:51] talked to them if I let those two boys
[1:17:53] sit there and I go falls
[1:17:54] I let them kind of give me their spiel
[1:17:55] just you pray about it and see if Joseph
[1:17:59] Smith is God's prophet just pray about
[1:18:01] it that's all they would say I'm like
[1:18:04] yeah right I said tell me this sir when
[1:18:08] you get the Holy Ghost they said only
[1:18:10] after baptism I said we'll open up your
[1:18:12] Bible buddy let's go to Acts chapter 10
[1:18:15] and we read it and the Bible said
[1:18:19] Cornelius got the Holy Ghost and then
[1:18:21] Peter said go be baptized I said what do
[1:18:24] you say about that he said let me go
[1:18:26] back and ask my elders I said fine you
[1:18:30] get you you bed and I told them I
[1:18:31] remember I said if you care about my
[1:18:33] soul you'll go back talk to them and
[1:18:36] call me back and guess what they never
[1:18:37] called me back because they don't care
[1:18:39] about my soul they care about church
[1:18:41] members and money and just getting done
[1:18:43] with there maybe not money but they just
[1:18:44] care about doing their job they don't
[1:18:46] see don't even have a revelation of the
[1:18:47] Word of God
[1:18:47] right and I told him I said Joseph Smith
[1:18:50] your prophet saw two persons our prophet
[1:18:53] saw one did you know that Joseph Smith
[1:18:57] saw the father's old man and the young
[1:18:59] man Jesus and came down and revealed his
[1:19:01] mysteries to them oh that's demon power
[1:19:04] right there church that's Satan there it
[1:19:06] is
[1:19:07] Satan transforming himself as an angel
[1:19:09] of light see that proves he wasn't a
[1:19:12] prophet because the God's Word comes to
[1:19:14] the Prophet and brother man saw that
[1:19:18] vision of the three rainbows coming one
[1:19:19] and the voice
[1:19:20] Thundra doubt said Jehovah the Old
[1:19:22] Testament is Jesus Christ in the new
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:19:27] forever hallelujah and they never came
[1:19:30] back and they never did come back and
[1:19:31] they've never come to our house on
[1:19:33] understand but I knew I could pin him
[1:19:36] down there I kind of like that it was
[1:19:37] kind of fun to do that we're just to see
[1:19:39] if they do respond I tried to give him I
[1:19:41] think they took a church age book if I'm
[1:19:42] not mistaken but of course you know I
[1:19:45] don't know what it would happen it'll be
[1:19:46] up to them and them in God now I'm
[1:19:50] almost done
[1:19:51] the forseeable Ram said see the
[1:19:53] Antichrist refuses what the truryde
[1:19:55] doctrine but see if you got the doctrine
[1:19:58] then you've got Christ see the people
[1:20:01] that are born again are gonna preach the
[1:20:02] right doctrine the people that are not
[1:20:05] born again are not gonna preach the
[1:20:07] right doctrine they're gonna get all
[1:20:08] scuffled scrupled up with things see the
[1:20:11] Antichrist he takes his own bride oh I'm
[1:20:14] glad I'm glad I'm Jesus's bride and not
[1:20:16] Satan's bride and builds her up under a
[1:20:19] creed of his own takes his own bride and
[1:20:21] makes her denomination she gives birth
[1:20:23] to another other denomination that's
[1:20:25] quoted in his Holy Scripture pardon me
[1:20:28] gives birth to daughter she don't become
[1:20:29] she becomes just like her mother natural
[1:20:31] worldly denominational opposing the
[1:20:34] spiritual bride the word Amen see we're
[1:20:38] a part of the word then it okay that's
[1:20:45] it now there's any questions on that
[1:20:47] topic let me know please like I said
[1:20:49] there's six quotes that I found there
[1:20:51] might be more parameters the new birth
[1:20:53] and baptism are different things but
[1:20:55] then after the seals it's all the same
[1:20:56] thing
[1:20:57] does everybody understand okay let me
[1:21:01] record us a testimony to our live
[1:21:03] streamers loving the Lord God bless you
[1:21:05] may God direct you to good home Church
[1:21:06] in God's time and season if you're part
[1:21:09] of our church I Love You Lord bless you
[1:21:10] okay later you can pause that
