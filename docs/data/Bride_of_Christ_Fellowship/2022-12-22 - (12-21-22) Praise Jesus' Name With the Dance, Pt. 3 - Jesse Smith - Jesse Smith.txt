========================================

I'm not quite sure how this will go by God's grace but trust in the Lord to Minister here tonight Hallelujah so I just wanted to look at a few different texts you know I was going through the scriptures today and on dance and I wanted to see which ones hadn't I covered you know extensively so I want to cover the ones I haven't covered as much by God's grace so just a quick review you know we found that the word dance in Hebrew means tutorial means to go in a sphere right to do circular circular Twirls rather sorry and uh and we see that and then we join all creation when we dance praise God because we know the planets are in that same motion Hallelujah we know animals and uh we you know animals dance and play and rejoice before the Lord the Bible said the mountains and Hills Skip and dance praise God hallelujah uh we know the whales sing Hallelujah in the ocean you know there's the birds singing the skies Hallelujah there's uh all creation in other words is worshiping and when we get the Holy Spirit We join all creation praise God oh it's a real blessing Hallelujah to know that that we have accomplished God's purpose like the Bible says God takes pleasure in his people when they're worshiping him praise God oh it's just beautiful praise God and God God long so beautify you and I with salvation with Deliverance praise God in other words God wants to deliver you praise God God wants to see us free Hallelujah for he whom the son is set free is free indeed Hallelujah that's exactly right Hallelujah and church we don't want to be chained up prisoners in the message right we don't want to be prisoners of the enemy right we're supposed to be in the message of the hour right we're supposed to be in the in the most uh fresh revelation of the word of God there is praise God and we are praise God and we don't want to be chained up we don't want to be prisoners of unbelief we don't want to be prisoners of sin we want to be free from sin praise God hallelujah we want to be set free we don't want to be uh chained up we don't want to be bound we don't want to be hindered we want to be free and alive and willing to do all that God's called us to do praise God thank God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus oh I love what the word of God gives us hallelujah be joyful in glory the Bible says hallelujah be joyful in the name of the Lord praise God so you know we reviewed a lot you know it's one one point I want to make you know brother Ray and I were texting about it today so it's nice to see brother Ray again to David you know dancing started with the logos dancing started with the Holy Spirit in Proverbs chapter 8 verse 30 and 31. the Bible said the Holy Spirit danced or played before the almighty invisible God so our my dance didn't start when I got saved my dance actually came from the Sun Hallelujah and the fact that I dance proves I am one of those Sons Hallelujah I'm a Son of God hallelujah you're a daughter of God hallelujah amen because where'd you get that praise from you got it from Christ amen that's the anointing praise God and the anointing breaks the yolks hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah so when we're struggling or something like that we need a fresh breakthrough right we need a fresh Revelation a fresh anointing praise God a fresh Revival praise God hallelujah we need that and God is gracious to give it to us hallelujah because he's rich in Mercy amen hallelujah now I want to look at uh a couple more here by God's grace let's go back to first Samuel 18. if you got your Bibles there first Samuel 18 familiar passage you know for those of us who watch David of course this summer you know what a wonderful uh show that is by God's grace but first Samuel 1817 now of course here this is the chapter right after Goliath went down so Goliath went down in chapter 17 and now chapter 18 is shortly thereafter right Saul uh he asked who was this young man that did that he'd forgot about all the all the Holy Ghost worship David gave him you know because he was I had all those evil spirits on him right but uh then the women start singing about David's victory right and it made Saul jealous right but verse 17 or yeah verse 18 17. and Saul said to David behold my elder daughter marib her will I give thee to wife only be thou Valiant for me and fight the Lord's battles for Saul said let not thine hand mind hand be upon him but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him okay I read the wrong one first Samuel 18. okay I'm sorry I wrote down the wrong scripture oh yeah verse six yeah six and seven sorry I wrote the wrong one six six and seven sorry and it came to pass as they came when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine that the women came out of all cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tablets with joy and with instruments of music and the women answered one another as they played and said Saul has slain his thousands and David is ten thousands so here we can see Into the Heart of Saul why he starts getting jealous he comes in and he's met with his people but they're not singing his Praises they're singing David's praises right and so uh instantly you know he gets jealous and and so Saul you know he starts going after Dave the Bible said he item from that day forth right he got all jealous but the Bible said the women were out there dancing they were praising the Lord they were singing saw us slain as thousands David is ten thousands hallelujah amen George what do we see when Giants fall the people Rejoice praise God Hallelujah and when you see a giant in your life or can say like this a mountain when you see a mountain move in your life that is time to Rejoice praise God Hallelujah that's what children of God do you know they struggle for years think about the years of struggle they were under Philistine rule they were under Philistine bondage right for years and years and years they're under that bondage and finally a mighty conqueror amen comes along and slays a giant praise God and it makes the people rejoice it gives them a new song Amen Hallelujah gives them Victory Hallelujah and to make some people dance and sing praise God Amen because giant small church if mountains move then it's time to praise God hallelujah but let's keep fighting until the giant Falls praise God keep fighting praise God because there is a time and season for all things there's a time to mourn there's a time to dance thank God there's a time to dance thank God Victory is coming Victory is Victory is ahead the Bible said through the blood of Jesus victories ahead praise God oh hallelujah it's beautiful think about the change you were under as a sinner right or you know each one of us the Bible said all have fallen short of the glory of God all of us now one of us have ever you know lived perfectly before God we've all fallen short of the glory of God we all know what it's like to struggle we all know what it's like to sin we all know what it's like to be in bondage well when we get victory over that that's the time to Rejoice praise God that's the time to give God glory that's the time to shout the Praises of God Amen that's the time to give God thanks Hallelujah and the Bible Jesus said speak to that mountain and watch that mountain move amen but really Church the real moving has got to be done in our hearts right that's what really has to happen the moving's got to be done in our hearts praise God but random said prayer is not so much about uh changing the situations about changing our hearts right sometimes so many times we pray and God change this change that brother man says what really needs to happen is we need to have a change of heart because we may be suffering and enduring through things that God wants us to suffer endure through so we can learn a lesson Hallelujah but the point is church we keep praying we keep believing Jesus said speak to the mountain he said let my if my words abide in you and you abide in my word ask what you will and the father will do it praise God he didn't say when he didn't say how he just said he's going to do it praise God oh hallelujah how many seen him do it praise God amen hallelujah thank God so we see this dance came after the giant fell dance came after the mountain moved amen that's what we need praise God hallelujah thank God he gives us like that but remember church I said uh last or last Wednesday this victory was so great it spread over into King akish's land see so Sinners heard about this and church that's what we get when a mountain moves Sinners are going to hear about it praise God they're going to overhear your testimony overhear your conversation well the Lord did this to me Lord did that oh you believe in that absolutely I believe in that Jesus Christ manifested his presence God poured out his power how can I not testify praise God amen I wonder how many people I've told about my mom being here with cancer you know I wonder I wonder how many people we've testified to about uh all the victories God has given to us praise God they need to hear it praise God and so see the dance comes naturally when the mountain moves oh Hallelujah that's exactly right Church in memory Church it takes God's spirit to do that Psalm 22 verse 3 pray please let's read that Psalm 22 verse 3. remember brother man said he said David God looked down at David and said he said that's a man after my own heart he said because he done lost all his pride amen see church when we realize we're nothing we realize God just wants us to praise him praise God it doesn't matter what people say or people think or people feel none of that matters always what matters is what God thinks Hallelujah we want God to be pleased with how we act amen we want God to be pleased with our worship we want God to be glorified with our lives amen oh Hallelujah Psalm 22 3. I'm getting there there we go what a what a portion this is this is of course verse one is the cross of Jesus my God my God why is thou forsaken me verse 3. but Thou Art holy O Lord that inhabit us the Praises of Israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou just deliver them amen so what an encouragement church just keep praising God just keep trusting in God he will deliver that's who he is he is the god of Salvation he is the god of Miracles amen he is the god of faithfulness he's the god of of Deliverance he's a god of Salvation he's the god of power he's the god of strength not by our might or our power but by the Holy Spirit saith the Lord amen doesn't come down to our power our strength not our might not our power but by the Holy Spirit praise God and God dwells in the Praises of his people so the church we know when we're praising God God is well pleased oh Hallelujah yes now if you would let's go next here I want to go to second Samuel six hopefully I got this one wrote down right here second Samuel 6 5. now this back to David Danson Hallelujah when the art came back and got into its location the presence of God was back in the church Hallelujah second Corinthians I'm sorry second Samuel six sorry second Samuel 6. verse 5. now of course we know this was in the part where uh uza touched the ark but remember all the worship was right the only thing that was wrong was that the ark was in the wrong location he was trying to do got a good service and it turned out to be a good service but he just missed the will of God in this one detail of his life right he just missed it he didn't seek God about this aspect of it but still notice here look at verse five and David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of furwood even on harps on solitaries on Timbers on cornets and on symbols praise God Hallelujah and then of course later on we skipped down there verse 12 and it was told King David saying the Lord has blessed the house of Obed Edom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the Ark of God so David went and brought up the ark from the house of Obed Edom into the city of David with gladness so see David made a mistake but church is what I love he learned from his mistake he wasn't going to complain about it he wasn't going to uh suffer too long about it he's going to say what's wrong let me fix it and let me get glad again in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah I've lost my gladness you know a man died a man died but he was able to get his gladness back he fixed the problem he got right back in the word yes he got right back in the perfect one of God Amen and then he could bring it up with praise and dancing just like he did it the first time Hallelujah and that's what I want to just point out all the instruments so we got a tambourine here tonight we got a piano organ we got a guitar how do we got these 10 string instruments right here we got vocal cords we can praise God with Hallelujah we got feet we can praise God with holy God we've got hands we can command our hands to praise the Lord all these instruments God wants all instruments to glorify him praise God bring her he said bring up the Ark of God bring up the presence of God back to the house of God bring it up with praise bring it up with instruments bring it up with worship because God is worthy of it all Hallelujah he's worthy of it all praise God Look What the Lord Has Done Hallelujah thank you Jesus oh it's beautiful that was verse 12. now go down to verse 14. and David danced before the Lord with all of his might and David was girded with the Leonard ephod the priesthood praise God so David in all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord was shouting and with the sound of a trumpet and as the Ark of the Lord came to the city of David McCall Saul's daughter looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart that isn't that something Church she could be married to this man and she despised his worship and that's something you can be so close to people and despise them now what we need church is the love of Jesus Christ Hallelujah right that's what we need we need the love of Jesus Christ so we don't despise people that are worshiping we can we can get past our uh differences and Worship the Lord praise God and sing his praises and Shout his Praises Hallelujah get into the spirit of God but someone so close even as a married partner somehow could forget the love between them and somehow could get such a starchy attitude that they no longer can worship and they speak against a real worshiper and David said if you don't like that your criticism is not stopping me I'll do more praise God hallelujah praise God that's what he had to do he couldn't let that Antichrist Spirit cool off his worship he had to worship anyway praise God oh my God see Church you know we come to church maybe even tonight I don't really feel like praising the Lord but I know I want to give God a sacrifice of praise you may have had a hard day you may have had a hard week I mean most of us have right but it's it's always a good thing to get out of the Flesh and get into the spirit praise God because God inhabits the Praises of his people the holy spirit's anointing you when you're praising the Lord hallelujah oh thank God Amen church we don't want the despiser's heart that will kill a church so fast brother said it's like a cancer that will come into the church right you know just in fact one person to the other one person to the other McCall despised it and I preached us years ago but I was uh remembering how there was numerous people that criticized the worship of the Lord right like we saw with uh McCall and remember uh there's some more we want to read here by God's grace let's go to Matthew 21 14. let's go to Matthew 21 14. now I said that on last Wednesday it was such a statement I felt it was the Lord but God looked down he said that's a son after my own heart and then he said I've got to curse the other one look that woman had made such she made a final like almost like a final decision I'm not gonna support the worship of God I'm going to stay in my uh stiff starchy religious mode she she must have made that decision or else God would have had mercy on her see church we don't want to get to a spot where we we won't repent praise God we want to be in a spot where we can repent praise God oh God hallelujah thank God we always want to repent we don't want to be in a spot where we can't repent or don't feel repentance Matthew 21 14 sorry let's do 14 15 and 16. and the Blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them hallelujah look at that healing in the Church of God hallelujah how many times has God healed in this house praise God he's the same yesterday today and forever and when the chief priests and Scribe saw the wonderful things that he did and the Children Cry now they saw me like weeping it means like shouting and praising the Lord and saying Hosanna let me save us to the Son of God save us they were so displeased so here again we see that Antichrist Spirit on the high priest now right first it was on Michael or macaw so I keep saying that wrong I keep saying that wrong week after week forgive me it was on the call and then it got on the high priest and they despised people that are trying to worship God right they're crying out praising God Hosanna save us save us and they didn't like it they're trying to cool down this worship That's what Satan noise does he tries to cool down your worship like we said on Wednesday Sunday morning we don't worship God by sleeping in church you don't worship God by passing notes and distracting people that's not how you worship God you worship God by getting into with the spirit praise God by obeying the word hearing the word accepting the word approving of the word believing the word loving the word amen and they were so displeased look at that mad in the house of God see sore displeased look at that verse 16. and said unto him hear us thou what these say so they got displeased we don't like this Jesus he said and they said do you hear what they say I like Jesus answer he answers their question with the question Hallelujah he said yay yeah have you never read I thought you were Bible students don't you remember reading this out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou Hast perfected praise Hallelujah he said Do You Hear What these children can you see these children all these bunch of Fanatics what do you think of what are these Fanatics doing he said haven't you read the word it's in the word praise God and brother Adam said there you have the Holy Ghost are in the word all the way praise God that proved these guys weren't in the word all the way because they tried to shut down real worship to Jesus Christ oh my god let's not be soreness please let's not be critical of worship let's join the worship let's get in the Holy Spirit let's be in the spirit on the Lord's Day praise God brother said that's the whole of the Christian Life that is the whole point of coming to church that's the whole point of being a Christian is walking in the leadership of the Holy Spirit hallelujah how many did it today praise God you know you're walking the spirit when you're denying the flesh when your flesh is tempted to do something and you deny that and you do the word of God now you're walking in the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah that's how you get in the spirit praise God Is by obeying the voice of the Lord as he speaks as he talks with you does he talk to your church Hallelujah does he Lead You does he does he give you those checks like brother bam said remember brother I was preaching the seals and he said something wrong he said I felt like I took candy from a child that's that's what he said the check feels like from the Holy Spirit I just stole something from a child oh my let's not have that let's not live with that feeling if we have that feeling let's confess it right away praise God let's feel like we've been good to a little child amen let's be like we bless the little children praise God let's not feel like we've stolen something so that's what the enemy does right he comes to steal your joy kill your influence right and destroy your testimony steal kill and destroy he comes to do those things but Jesus said I've come that you might have life and have it more abundantly praise God ah I'm the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father except through me Hallelujah oh thank God Hallelujah thank you Jesus so look Church there's that Antichrist Spirit there the same one that was there in McCall's day here it is but we also see the Holy Spirit the holy spirit says go on and praise the Lord just like in David's day go on and praise the Lord hallelujah don't stop praising the Lord keep praising God and here it is in Jesus day these Thousand Years Later the holy spirit said go ahead shout out the Praises go ahead and cry loud go ahead and worship Jesus don't stop him let Him worship praise God oh Hallelujah Luke 19 35. beautiful story here now here we see Jesus coming in on Palm Sunday by God's grace so the first passage children are crying out in the temple and Jesus says haven't you read the word of God this is how worship is supposed to be first you know what we we don't you know we can grow it we can grow in childlike faith right just if we just like a child you know like today we were at our house you know and and I think it was uh Zion and Genevieve just started saying let's I just had like I was playing some music from Christian music on my phone and we were just over there in our basement there and Genevieve is also like hey let's dance and Zion's like let's dance you know how you you know how he repeats everybody's phrases you know I thought look how easy it is for a child ah look how easy it is for a natural shot to enter into dancing what about a spiritual child amen to enter the Praises of God hallelujah I thought that would be look how simple look how childlike faith can just enter into the promises of God oh it's beautiful Luke 19 35 and they brought him to Jesus and they cast their garments upon the cult and they set Jesus thereon and as he went they spread their clothes in the way now let me stop there this is one of the verses I've used to say of the importance of praying before service you've got to lay the clothes before Jesus you got to make the way for Jesus to come in right you got to lay them there the other one was in uh I think it's Exodus or Deuteronomy the people had to bring the oil so the priest could minister Hallelujah and the third was Joshua the singers and some of the soldiers went before the ark the word of God and the armed one represent those who had the the full armor of God on praise God and the Bible says we got the full armor of God on the Bible says you're praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Holy Spirit that's right so there's three Witnesses church that we need to pray before service praise God and lay our requests before God lay our palms down before God hallelujah lay in his presence wait upon the Lord he'll renew your strength you'll rise up like the eagle if you wait upon the Lord Jesus Christ I didn't get to that one on Sunday morning brother Chris I wanted to get to that one I think I think that's a great teaching that scripture has meant so much to me those scriptures power of prayer before the word of God and then brother Adam said if a preacher walks into a congregation like that they're bound to hear from heaven that's that should be the desire of our hearts to hear from heaven Hallelujah Glory verse seven I'm sorry 37. and when he was come nigh even now at The Descent of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a whisper huh where they Whispering when the Son of God was there no sir with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen Hallelujah church we sing that song he's done so much for me I cannot tell it all Hallelujah so if we really believe that we should have plenty of praise for Jesus right the mighty Works you've seen now some seem more Mighty than others but the route of it is if we're saved we've seen Mighty Works in our lives we all got a reason to praise amen Glory verse 38 saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees from among the Malton look at these guys said a master rebuke thy disciples saying Jesus you need to rebuke them look at Satan trying to get the Son of God to rebuke his own children right I wonder what Jesus would Jesus give into that peer pressure well you need to rebuke them they're too loud too much noise we should have some services like that where we're really loud amen we're really enjoying praising the Lord amen and thanking God for all that he's done hallelujah hallelujah thank God he said Master rebuked these people Jesus rebuked them because they're praising you a church if he's the same yesterday today forever what do you think is going to happen today praise God which spirit is going to try to cool you down and not give God all the praise there's only one spirit that does that praise God Hallelujah and the devil say rebuke them there's too much shout and there's too much praising too much of glorifying God and Jesus says right back in verse 40. can you put it up there verse 40. he says and he answers to them I tell you that if thee should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out amen if these people don't praise God Something's Gonna praise God Amen this is scripture being fulfilled the church guys say like this our lives are fulfilling scripture praise God Hallelujah every day that we live we get closer to the Rapture I knew the Rapture is closer we're fulfilling scripture God help us to give him praise amen thank God Amen thank you Jesus oh it's beautiful so now we got two he says he says haven't you read in the scripture the the praise of children is perfected praise then he says if they will worship God he said the stones would immediately cry out like brother man preach that sermon what is the attraction on the mountain and that's this was a mountain right right here by the Mount of Olives he was coming right down in the city praise God what was the attraction scripture is being fulfilled the Messiah is coming oh Jesus is coming suddenly to his Temple and pretty soon Church Jesus coming to his broad amen well hopefully it's in our day if not praise God let's live like it is praise God every Christian should live like it is going to be in their day so they prepared they're not getting lacks on God they're not getting lazy they're not getting distracted they're focused on Jesus and they're living like he's coming praise God Hallelujah oh thank you Lord now as I was studying this I thought wow Jesus said in other words he said I'm not going to rebuke them I'm not going to rebuke real worshipers when people are excited about what Jesus doing I won't rebuke them you know why because the same uh the same voice here speaking through Jesus the Same the same Divine voice speaking through Jesus letting the praise go forth Jesus was not letting the Pharisees touch the worship he wasn't going to let the Pharisees hinder the worship of God so I love it the same voice that said I won't rebuke him they've got to praise God the same voice we find under the third seal when Satan is riding in the Dark Ages got bounces in his hand he's capturing the wealth of the world it's dark ages they don't have Bibles they don't have truth but what does the voice say in the midst of the darkest age brother said it was the darkest age in the midst of the darkest age they all of a sudden in the time where where the the black horse riders riding they hear a voice crowd and the voice says hurt not the wide and the oil praise God oh in other words Jesus is always protecting the stimulation of Revelation and the love the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus will always protect that he'll always let the people praise God he'll always give them Freedom he'll always let them rejoice in his presence praise God he won't rebuke us for praising the Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah that really blessed me today praise God Jesus is always protecting the Holy Ghost worshipers Hallelujah he says touch not my oil and my wine in other words I'm not going to rebuke them for praising me I'm not going to rebuke these children for crying out I'm not going to rebuke David for dancing with all of his might at the happiness of seeing the word returned oh oh my thank the Lord praise God I love you Jesus thank you Lord God hallelujah beautiful story Mark 14 verse 3 let's go there mark 14 verse 3. thank you Jesus so again we see here Jesus protecting the oil and the wine verse 3 and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he said at me there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spitener very precious and she break the box and poured it on his head and there were some that had indignation within themselves see they're people just mad they're just mad right McCall was mad they're mad at the worship their sore displeased in Matthew 21. what was the other one uh they they thought these people need to rebuke for their worship oh my and they had Indonesian and said why was this waste of the ointment made for it might have been sold for more than 300 Pence and have been given to the poor now that Satan lying right through judas's lips he wasn't even filled yet with Satan yet he's already letting Satan lie through his lips a fake compassion for the poor all in attempt to stop this woman from worshiping the Lord oh my God can you believe this is oh unbelievable It Was the Same Spirit now look oh it got more deceptive well the parents of the Antichrist Spirit gets more deceptive well now I see now it's just not oh tell them to shut that shut up tell them to stop this well now it's oh no we should have gave this money to the poor let's stop this worship and we should take this money to the poor and Jesus said you don't care nothing about the poor you don't care all you want to do is stop this worship why because worship empowers the person how they do worship brings you into the presence of Christ the King amen how do we just read that scripture he inhabits the Praises of his people God is right there God wants you to stay in that channel worship God doesn't want you to leave that channel he wants you to stay in the channel worship he doesn't want you to leave it and so Jesus will always protect that opportunity Jesus wants you to enjoy his presence he wants you to enjoy coming to church singing praises dancing shouting crying Hallelujah Jesus want you to enjoy that because you're living in his presence Hallelujah beautiful and they murmured against her imagine she's pouring out all this Praises on Christ they don't eat that should give us to the poor what a waste what a you know what an awful thing what an embarrassment this is to the master and the whole time Jesus is loving it Hallelujah because God Delights in the worship of his people praise God that's exactly right I love what Jesus and Jesus said in verse 6 let her alone see he says oh he always says touch not the oil and the wine you can't touch that stop criticizing her for worshiping because I'm only here for a little bit Lord this church we have a short window of our lifetime to worship on this Earth a short window we don't even know how many I mean we're probably 70 you know in a just a general probability right it's a probability right it's a probability it's not an exact number but see we're promised that we have a short window we don't know when it's our time to go so we want to make the most of every moment we want to spend time in the prayers of God we want to give God glory we want to we want to leave footprints on the sand of time this is how you serve God even in Trials give God praise amen don't don't stop the worship keep the worship going keep the victory going why take a loss and we can have Victory praise God Church are we not the Joshua Army praise God we don't have to have defeats we can have Victory all the time amen let's keep our our battles so short term and let's overcome right away let's get everything under the blood we're the Joshua Army we're Overcomers all things are possible to them that believe praise God hallelujah that's what we've seen in our church Victory after Victory we're keep moving on we're pressing forward we're loving Jesus let's not stop the praise let's keep it going praise God Hallelujah like I showed last you know Sunday it's preachers that uh bring down the praise right right I shall remember that verse I preached when I preached the doctrine of devils series of second Corinthians the Bible said uh these evil preachers would put the people in bondage right that's what we see with these message churches that fall away or denominational people they put the people in bondage and they don't allow them to be free in the Holy Spirit hallelujah it's my desire that every person here is Free by the grace of God that's my desire I'm going to be free today God sees your hands praise God God sees your hearts what a beautiful story Hallelujah should have been given to the poor but they murmured verse six and Jesus said let her alone don't trouble her I love that that see when you're worshiping God Jesus looks over at Satan said don't trouble this person Jesus make sure the Devil stay off amen praise God Amen created me a clean heart oh God Amen see Jesus always protects the oil and the wine praise God he'll rebuke Satan hallelujah amen you can't touch that oil you can't touch that stimulation by Revelation you can't touch that so t-shirts he church we just got to yield to it and let God flow through us because Jesus will protect us amen oh yes that's exactly right the Bible says he has to praise God he will not let it be hurt he will not let the oil and wine be destroyed it's not what the Bible says it's coming to me now the Bible says God will not leave himself without a witness oh thank you God there's always going to be somebody's got a witness of the oil and wine because Satan cannot stop it Jesus promised to protect it Hallelujah Jesus will not rebuke you for worship Jesus will encourage you to keep going praise God oh thank God Amen praise God hallelujah oh Hallelujah I'm glad I could be a fanatic for Jesus praise God Hallelujah aren't we all glad praise God glory I love this this is so beautiful he said let her alone why trouble ye her in other words Satan don't trouble them Jesus is going to make sure the troubles are lessened when you're when you're real worshiper the troubles won't last as long they won't be as hard because Jesus is going to protect you like that song says troubles don't last always right troubles don't last they must have been years since we say never troubles don't last always they don't last always right troubles pass right victories come because Jesus is protecting the oil and the wine he's protecting your soul that's what I'm saying amen thank God thank you Lord that's exactly right don't trouble her for sheath wrought a good work on me I love this for ye have the poor with you always in other words Judas you've had these poor people here all the time why aren't you ministers well why haven't you been ministering to them why are you complaining now see how the devil likes to do that so try to solve the problem but the whole time before he was ignoring the problem that's why we got to give all of us praise God that's why I got to fast and pray Hallelujah fast and pray and give alms always the Bible says pray without Cece see he brings us up he brings the poor people up but the whole time he's been neglecting them you don't really want to help the poor I'll say like this church we need a Cornelius attitude praise God cornillo says prayers were caught up in heaven can you imagine that brother the Angels had caught the prayers of Cornelius in a bowl as a memorial the Angels remembered his prayers his fasting his arms Church all Heaven is recording your love for Jesus praise God Amen amen heaven's got a record of it praise God and the devil can't get into God's computer system praise God the devil can't hack Heaven Hallelujah he's kicked out praise God Amen he's not going to hack that Hallelujah because I thus he don't have the keys to the kingdom hallelujah thank God Amen we've got the keys to the kingdom it's the name of Jesus Christ praise God ooh hallelujah thank God thank you Jesus she has a lot of good work on me for you have the poor verse 7 with you always and whensoever ye will you may do them good but me have not always now I love this she hath done what she could and remember verse 9 he said truly I send you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she had done shall be spoken of of a memorial of her and Judas one of the 12 went under the chief priest to betray him then look at this Jesus picks up this one woman's worship this was such an intimate worship this was such a wonderful expression of Love Upon Jesus that Jesus picks us up and said I'm going to inspire oh he said I'm going to protect the oil I'm going to protect this so much I'm going to have preachers always preach this for 2 000 years ah this act of love praise God and here's what it is church she just did what she could God's not asking you do things you can't do God just wants you do things that you can do amen hallelujah I feel like you're punching the wall like brother Diggs here I don't want that thing to fall off the wall but last time he punched it something fell off the wall in there but hallelujah praise God he's not asking you everything he just wants you to do what you can do God I can come to church I can sing praises I can preach the word I can glorify God I can pray for the sick Church let's do what we can do because God is glorified in that just do what you can do amen Hallelujah just don't sell the Lord out and do less let's do all we can do oh Hallelujah Jesus told Satan there and Judas leave her alone he's protecting the oil and the wine do whatever you can to Worship the Lord then see Church there's going to be memorials right all your all your acts for Jesus and worship are memorials can we think of another one what about the queen of the South wasn't that a memorial it's gonna be such a memorial God's going to use it on the day of judgment she crossed the whole desert she put herself in danger of being robbed she put herself in danger of being abducted oh brother Adam says on tape a woman a woman not a man who could at least maybe fight for himself and maybe be equally as strong as another man a woman who couldn't even really defend herself she put everything on the line to support God's gifts amen ah and brother I said if we do that today if we support God's gifts we'll have another Millennium praise God Hallelujah in other words God will anoint the fifo ministry he'll Rapture his bride and we'll go into the Millennium praise God oh it's beautiful Hallelujah what a promise Church Satan can't stop the oil line tonight he can't stop it because Jesus Promised nobody can touch it nobody can touch it it's mine in church it's a memorial unto the Lord praise God what a blessing so there now we see there's four examples like McCall McCall's one of the four there's four examples of worship going forth and and Satan try to stop it right there but then Jesus steps in and said no this is right I'm not going to rebuke them they got to cry out I'm going to let them praise the Lord they Satan cannot touch the oil line now before I preach that list with spontaneous Praise Jesus loves spontaneous praise he likes somebody every now and then just to give a shout or a scream or a hallelujah or a weep or or a hand waved or or just a hallelujah or something he loves spontaneous worship he loves when his children respond to the word of God Amen hallelujah amen oh he loves the church he Delights in the worship Hallelujah he Delights in the praise of his people oh it's so beautiful what a beautiful portion of scripture so we see David now going back to David he danced before the Lord with all the instruments and the Antichrist Spirit hated that it hated everybody getting an instrument it hated everybody like our church is so small if everybody got an instrument I mean if a couple more of us get a few instruments we'll have a whole church band like everybody in the church will have an instrument right I used to play the Tamarin years ago and I stopped doing it because I didn't feel like I was very successful at it I still have a hard time with beat by the way but I just want you to see this God loves when everybody's involved and everybody's giving Glory everybody's making a sacrifice of praise Hallelujah God loves that and God looks down from heaven say that's a church after my own heart that's a church that wants to go in the Rapture praise God Amen that's a church who doesn't just talk about being the bride of Christ they are the bride of Christ amen Hallelujah I said church that's not not just we're just called The Bride of Jesus the bride of Christ Fellowship but we actually are the bride of Christ Hallelujah church I don't want to talk about it I don't want to have a name I live but I'm dead that was the starter's Church age where Lutheran and 90 of them Luther said fell away I don't want to fall away I want to keep pressing on I want Jesus to protect my wine and oil amen I want him to let me praise let me be a free man let me be to worshiper let me be a true Son of God who cries out and worships the Lord amen hallelujah I kind of like having a little more room up here to preach about God's grace now I got a little bit of room to there's enough room for me to preach in here now you know like like that old Mishawaka preacher said that's 45 minutes I'm trying to see if I can bring this down here next verse uh let's go if we could let's go to uh Jeremiah 31 here Jeremiah 31. Lydia would you get me a water hun please I normally don't drink water but I had a coffee before service and now I'm really thirsty should not have had that coffee I never drink water when I preach but Jeremiah 31 please Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you sir oh it's a beautiful chapter Scofield calls this the summary is Israel in the last day so our day first one at the same time saith the Lord will I be a God of all the families of Israel and they shall be my people remember Church you already are God's beloved Romans 9 says that the Gentiles are now God's beloved you are God's people right now verse two thus saith the Lord the people which were left of the sword found Grace in the wilderness even Israel when I went to cause him to rest I like that found Grace don't you like that church you found Grace in your wilderness you found Grace in the midst of the travel you found Grace and difficulty first that's how God shows us he loves us he gives us Grace when even we walked in the wilderness right when we chose the wrong way we still find Grace we keep finding more and more good things because God is so faithful God is so loving we ought to give God praise amen Grace in the wilderness praise God Grace in our mistakes Grace in our trials thank you hon I appreciate that thank you that's the last time I'm drinking coffee on a Wednesday night right before church yeah forgive me I shouldn't have done that verse 3. the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying oh this isn't this beautiful Church look yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love your love never fails and never gives up never runs out on me goes on and on and on I just want the Holy Spirit to sing that heart in my heart all night praise God yes it overwhelms my heart and God's my soul I love us and I never ever have to be afraid because one thing remix your love never fails and never gives up never runs out he loves a blinded people are you with me Trisha he has blinded them and yet he says I still love you with an everlasting love if that isn't Grace that's Grace in the wilderness amen that's Grace and blindness what about us we've got eyes open thank God for Amazing Grace amen he's got Everlasting Love guys he's got husband love for us his bride amen his Gentile wife his gentile people thank God we found Grace in the time of the Gentiles Hallelujah oh thank you Jesus amen I've loved you with an everlasting love how many can see God's love from the the moment you were born till now praise God constantly that's all I see God you spare me from this you spare me from that you answer my prayer here you protected this one protected that one all I can see is God's Everlasting Love upon me because he says I've loved you with an everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee he's drawing you in other words he keeps inviting you come to me praise God come back to me praise God no matter what trial you're going through just come back to me no matter what you've done come back to me I've loved you with the Everlasting Love My Love won't fail my love for you keeps going on and on oh it's so beautiful hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah in church if you feel like your life's destroyed you ought to be encouraged with verse four again again I will build you up All My Life's in shambles everything's broken down it looks like everything's destroyed I'll Build You Up God said my love is going to build you up I tell you I'm obligated by my love for you my love is going to rebuild your walls your walls are salvation your gates are praised amen I'm going to rebuild your Gates so you can praise me again Hallelujah what's going to do that my everlasting love amen church when you lose your praise or lose the joy of Salvation God said I'm going to build that up again I will build it church if you like I can't build it I can't get it back I can't get the love of God back don't worry Jesus will build it back for you just repent repent every day right the Bible says repent daily Die daily and watch Jesus he'll just build it back up again pretty soon you have walls of stuff I am saved praise God I've got Gates of Praise I can go in the house of God I can give God praise because God has built me up God has strengthened me God has restored my life because he loves me with an eternal love amen no doubt because I was chosen to him before the foundation of the world that's why I praise God oh Hallelujah that's why he won't let me stay broken he won't let me stay defeated right how come I keep getting encouraged again because his Everlasting Love promised to build me up he said nobody can hurt the oil and the wine amen nobody can touch it God promised him because his love to protect me Build Me Up make me strong again praise God not by my my or power but by the Holy Spirit saith the Lord [Applause] it was not a temporary love Jesus has it's an everlasting love thank you from generation to generation he's faithful to a thousand Generations oh a thousand Generations Hallelujah he's faithful to everyone even the blinded Generations and church we're not blinded we're not chewing of the darkness we're Children of the light let us walk in the light as he's in the light amen again I will build thee up and thou shalt be built o Virgin of Israel don't the Bible say we're a chaste virgin to Christ ah think of all the sins that we've done Church think about the evils we've done before and now after we're being Christians and God still by the blood makes us pure as if we never did it in the first place because that's the soul of the believer the soul never did in the first place of course the mind and body did that they got proof of it they've got pictures of it they've got they've brought a picture of me and Kyle and say look here's you drunk I said you better keep that you'll never see it again you'll see me drunk on the Holy Ghost praise God keep it it's the only evidence you have but that picture will burn but God's picture of me and his family album can never burn amen it's Eternal praise God he sees me as a son he loves me with Everlasting Love I'm his child I was chosen praise God oh Hallelujah a virgin to Christ my soul my soul is a part of him my soul has never had another lover my soul has only loved the Lord oh thank you Jesus thank you Lord oh Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again that means you were once you're once adorned with tablets and shall go forth in the dances of them that make Mary to see church when our lives are broken down we don't feel like dancing there's not a bone in my body we'd say or I don't have one feeling about dancing for the Lord all that means is God in his love is going to build you up so you can do it again he's not going to let you remain broken down and Sham was just like Elijah like I preached on Sunday just like Elijah taking those 12 Stones amen God is going to restore praise God God will build it back praise God just like they built back the wall of Israel just like they rebuilt the temple constantly God is going to build back no matter what Satan tries to destroy God will get the last word God's Everlasting Love will make sure he builds you up again praise God hallelujah praise God Satan cannot touch the oil in the water that's why you're here tonight Church God's Everlasting Love Drew you here tonight praise God you could have skipped Church right you could have found you could have found some problem not to come to church right we all could have I've got a little cough oh my tires are a little low on air but they're not flat right Satan could have you could have tried to defeat you drag you down for some reason the love of God brought us all here tonight because God wants to rebuild you God wants to re-establish you he wants you to enjoy salvation he wants to have Gates of Praise Hallelujah the gates that open up and the praise of God flow out of your Gates amen the the praise of God flow out of your gates open up your Gates Hallelujah and let the praise of God flow out of your Gates amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah praise God thank you for your love Dear God Hallelujah well now I'm feeling good Hallelujah took a little while I'm feeling good now very good it takes about an hour to feel good preaching but man said it takes me an hour to warm up in an hour to slow down or an hour to shut down I can relate to that sometimes Hallelujah beautiful God would we rebuild Israel and then she would dance is that what the word of God says now Church what does build again mean build again means edify edify means to make strong and complete so see how your joy of the Lord is your strength see how your strength is connected to your praise right you can't have praise you can't have a dance put that back together would you honey uh Jeremiah 31 was it for see when you're built you're strong because that's edification edification is building up you come to church you get stronger you hear the word of God stronger you feed on God's word stronger stronger stronger and then comes the dance so see how it's so important the joy of the Lord is your strength Hallelujah if we want to be strong we've got to let God build up our lives God's not trying to tear us down it's Satan that's trying to tear us down but God is trying to build us up and then when God builds us up we should be glad about it and say thank God I'm strong again now I'm going to give God praise amen because he didn't give up on me Hallelujah praise God he could have given up on me and my shamos and my my destruction and my sins he could have gave up on me and my iniquity my transgressions but he did it because his love is unfailing praise God it's everlasting love it's love that cannot fail praise God it's love that is faithful Hallelujah I didn't know y'all in other words I won't let you fall I won't let you be demolished I'm backing up with myself Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah with my everlasting love praise God I'm backing you up myself Hallelujah thank you Jesus the Lord is the strength of my life I remember that from the book of Psalms the Lord is the light of my salvation the Lord is the strength of my life Church you and I can only be strong if God's anointing us and God anoints us when we praise him when we obey the word of God that's when God anoints us amen when we obey trust and obey and then God anoints us to praise His name to worship His holy name oh it's so beautiful remember the steps Joshua gave us in Joshua chapter one we're not going to turn there but he said be strong be only thou strong and very courageous to keep all the word of the Lord that you don't stray from the right to the left then he says let the word of God always be in your mouth what's the third one and then he said meditate it on it all day and night three steps keep the word of God don't go astray speak it and meditate on it obey it speak it think on it praise God let's say it together let's say obey it speak it stink it Hallelujah it's not just press play it's just obey speak and meditate amen that's what it is praise God anybody can press play and live like a devil and inject false doctors in there but those who do those three steps praise God those that obey and don't turn to left or right they don't take a permissive will of God those that stay on the narrow road and speak the word of God and meditative on it Hallelujah they're the strong ones they're the ones that are giving God praise Hallelujah it's kind of nice you're standing there because I can kind of point right here and you know gives me a little bit of a room to stretch out there Hallelujah there's not enough room for me to preach in here I'm just joking Hallelujah see Church what is it when we're strong what do we got we got the full armor of God on now I want to review this briefly for brother Chris so let's go to Ephesians chapter six brother brother you want to be strong and Lord we talked we did the Bible say this week on the phone right we talked about the basics right well here's what you do when you do that when you're studying in the morning you're seeking the kingdom of God first Ephesians chapter 6. just briefly then I got there's two more verses after that thank you Lord Ephesians 6. now Church it kind of came to me that if I'm not mistaken all these six attributes of the armor are in the human Spirit or mind all right so like like we say it just you know simply we got to get our minds right if we're going to be Warriors for Christ we got to get our minds right first thing we got to do every day get your mind right church I wake up I'm surprised how many times I wake up in a bad attitude I'm like I was dancing at church the other day like how can I be screaming and crying and praising the Lord I was shaking hands I was weeping on somebody's shoulder what happened to me right I got well just got in the flesh right got tired got in the flesh like everybody else praise God right I was just sleeping so we got to get our minds right right away now brother Chris here it is verse 11 brother actually let's read 10. finally my brother be strong in the Lord in the power of His might so it's not our might it's the Lord's might verse 11 put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand though Against The Wiles of the devil really church that's all we're battling is Satan's got traps for us Satan just set up things in our lives trying to distract us trying to get us to lay down our armor but we've got to keep the armor on in every area of Life he's trying to get us to lay down the sword or lay down the helmet of salvation are you really saved you really think you're sick you think you're good enough to be saved of course I'm not good enough that's why Jesus died for me praise God Hallelujah I can't get to heaven there'll be no Bragging in heaven why did all these Miracles or I did all these sermons there's not one brag in heaven all the bragging all the versions is on Christ Jesus Hallelujah amen there's no man that'll boasts in the presence of Jesus Christ praise God we're just tools that God may have picked up for a little while a couple years for six months God picked up John the Baptist and used him drank out of him use his ministry set him down and let him be beheaded sometimes God will train you for 30 years for six months of ministry I know shine you before the whole world and then set you down and put you off on the side now how many of us want to wait 30 years to be used by God I would raise my hand for that I'm glad nobody raised our hand I was thinking today about all the financial blessings we've got in the last few years but I thought you know what all those came after 15 years of pastoring real small churches in other words I wasn't living the rich life I wasn't living the High Life sometimes preaching just one person one time I preached to just a phone everybody's sick on a Wednesday night I think somebody took Lydia out to use the restroom and I was just preaching on it to a phone that's the way of humility Church that's a way of Fame and Fortune that's the way of humanity God's humbled me through years and years of testing and trials he's humbled me over and over and over again and at church that's because I constantly need it Satan's constantly trying to break down my walls but God's always building me back up again hallelujah praise God these last few years I've never seen such Financial blessings bra but look at all the years of sacrifice it took it did not come easy and I did not expect any of that I was thinking about like John the Baptist 30 years in the wilderness 30 years I'm going to use you for six months was it hard to understand yes but was it God's will yes it was God's everlasting love to John the Baptist verse 12 brother Chris we don't wrestle against flesh and blood our enemies are not other people but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in that evil day and to having done all stand you have to withstand his attacks in other words you know you're going to get dark shot at you but you've got to withstand them we'll never get to a spot Church where we can just hide away and say oh no more battles Satan can't get me no no that's not how it's going to be we have to withstand them we have to see the dark coming and just pick up the shield and say by faith I'll overcome praise God hallelujah praise God we got to stand and look the fiery darts in the face and say I've got weapons I've got a defense I've got Christ in me so I'm more than a conqueror amen we gotta look the enemy right in the face and say not today Satan amen get thee behind me in the name of Jesus Christ I take Faith and defeat you praise God you're not hitting my heart you're not going to hurt me because I've got faith Hallelujah is that right I'm not gonna let your burning lies and burning attacks I'm not going to let those burning thoughts get in me I've got faith I'm going to Worship the Lord anyhow hahaha they're enjoying the house of the Lord amen thank God church we gotta do that every day all of us every day each one of us have to do that every day choose today I'm going to pick up the sword I'm sorry sword today I'm going to pick up the shield you have to withstand them like I was see I was giving brother Chris some warnings on Sunday morning remember that I was saying they're going to try to Satan's going to try to overcome you but if you've got a real Revelation the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against you because your weapons are mightier than the devils have some word dreams and let's pray about it in the name of Jesus buddy let's after service let's pray about right here buddy Hallelujah Jesus can take all those dreams away he's more than able brother the oil and wine cannot be hurt Hallelujah Hallelujah you're going through seasons of testing with the Lord is standing with you that's exactly right that's exactly right Hallelujah we used to sing that song though none go with me still I will follow though none go with me still I will follow going on go with me so I will follow no turning back there's no turning back the cross before me the World Behind Me they'll cross me for me the world's behind me I'm not going back to the world they got nothing for me they've just got fiery darts to kill me that's all they got the cross before me the World Behind Me no turning back no turning back I'm going to praise the Lord I'm gonna walk on with Jesus praise God I'm gonna walk on I'm not stopping I just got started praise God if you thought that was something wait till the next year praise God Amen Hallelujah each year we should get more free in the Lord right each year we should get more in love with Jesus ready we go from glory to glory from Faith to Faith The Best Is Yet To Come amen how many believe that praise God oh Hallelujah if you would have told me in 2021 what God was going to do in 22 I would have said no way right this blessing's gonna happen that healing is going to happen uh we're gonna get another Soul save all these things you I mean I would say oh man that was that's hard to believe but God does exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think you're gonna tell me the whole church will be dancing to service in 2000 you're going to tell me that in 2022 yeah man Hallelujah there's greater things ahead for us I already believe that I believe with all my heart with all my heart because Jesus Promised it because we don't look at the natural things we look at the Unseen things we look at things that are Eternal not things that are temporary we're looking at spiritual principles being fulfilled in our lives I didn't know I was going to preach this law help me Lord Jesus usually what happens all right uh verse 14 stand you therefore having your loins good about with the truth okay so brother Chris loins is the belt so I got a belt on right this keeps my clothes up right so then I can move if not the clothes would be all over I wouldn't be able to move so the Bible says gird up the loins of your mind right so each morning you got to get your mind tight right you got to focus it you got to get ready to move this mind's got to be ready to battle here battle there battle there battle there it's got to be ready to move it's got to move from like with a preacher it's got to move

right it's got to be it's got to be tight you gotta be ready to move right your mind your mind is ready mine is ready to answer those questions right it's ready to testify like I was walking around all day doing our Christmas shopping and had my Jesus head on I was just waiting somebody talked to me about Jesus somebody talking about Jesus and a man he gets up there and he says I like your hat I said Hallelujah and he quoted Isaiah 9 6 to me he should be called wonderful counselor the Everlasting father and right there in all day I said thank God for sending the son Jesus Christ I didn't shout it out loud but I said the kids heard it I said Thank You Jesus or the Son of God Merry Christmas Hallelujah I'm just waiting for somebody to ask me about my hat ask me about my hat ask me about Jesus praise God for you there be that find it so get your mind that's the first thing brother get that mind that belt get your belt tightened so ready to move next the breastplate of righteousness now I interpret that is it's protecting your heart your emotions right your breath is protecting your heart heart is your emotions your heart is protected by Jesus righteousness Satan can't touch your emotions right because Jesus is protecting that there it is can't touch the oil in the wine Hallelujah see you got to have your heart protected by the righteousness of Christ I'm not saved because of my righteousness I'm saved because of his righteousness and let me tell you this I'm daily seeking his righteousness I don't have enough of his righteousness that's why I got to seek it first every single day praise God righteousness is integrity purity of heart and life doing the Commandments keeping the word of God yes beautiful verse 15 having your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace Brother Adam said that's being able to go Anytime Anyplace so this is now getting into Europe be able to witness or do the will of God or being willing to be a servant willing to walk and pass that maybe you're not comfortable walking in but your feet your feet your heart is ready to walk in God's ways not our ways God's ways right verse 16 above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith he may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the devil so faith faith is trust so I trust God no matter what I've got a I've got ability to trust God despite the fiery difficult lies that Satan is the Bible said he bends his bow of Lies so he's shooting all these fire lies that's a burning gossip or that's a burning uh accusation wow that's a really harsh accusation but if you've got trust in God I trust God I'm not going to listen to the devil because I know the Bible says this praise God Hallelujah I trust God right sometimes you hear something that burns you up and you how in the world because this be how is this possible don't let it hit you praise God Hallelujah get your Shield up when it comes back just defend it get it away praise God let it fall off Hallelujah the Bible says the Holy Spirit Will cast down all imaginations praise God you've got a powerful Shield when that when that lie hits that Shield it just bounces right off praise God it just bounces off you got strength you got trust in God you know there's no weapon that's formed against you that shall prosper praise God there's no fiery dark that can break through God's faith God's revelation praise God it doesn't quench some of the fiery darts it quenches what I'll ever say ah oh not some why can't we make it through some Temptations no church you can make it through all Temptations all temptation may seem hard now but you just give it some time just put some prayer in it and you'll get the victory Hallelujah that's the key we just got to talk to the Lord about it pray about it all the fiery every weapon that's formed against me shall not prosper verse 17 and take the helmet of salvation I know I'm saved Chris that's what you can tell the devil I know I'm saved I was baptized in Jesus Christ's name I wasn't baptized in my name if you weren't baptized in my name it's not I'm not going to get you to heaven Jesus is going to get you to heaven Hallelujah same way I was baptized we were baptized from William branham's name or Paul's name or Apollos or Peter those men have no authority to to say but Jesus has authority to say because he died in your praise praise God and therefore he took your shame so he can give you his glory praise God Hallelujah it's beautiful and take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God our only offensive offensive weapon praise God and nobody's got Satan don't have a sharper sword than you got he don't sometimes you don't have a bigger weapon than you he don't have a bigger gun than you you don't have a bigger nothing than you you've got the best weapon there ever was in fact church if I know the Bible right when he looks at your weapon the Bible said demons tremble oh yeah oh come on somebody hallelujah hallelujah the demons tremble at the name of Jesus Jesus said I'm going to send you away they said oh don't torment us before our time oh so the spirit of Jesus is the name of Jesus nothing is stronger than the power of God the name of Jesus Christ praise God hallelujah let's use our weapon praise God let's use a sharp sword let's use this weapon that cannot be defeated praise God we've got the greatest weapon ever given to mankind may God help us to use it speak the word of God hallelujah hmm obey it speak it and meditate on it you've got all the keys so be strong in the Lord I might preach a part
