[0:00] six God bless the live streamers trust
[0:02] the Lord will minister to you tonight by
[0:05] God's
[0:24] grace
[0:26] Hallelujah I'll read four and five then
[0:28] we can uh read verse together by God's
[0:30] grace this is a more scriptural picture
[0:32] as far as I understand the Bible never
[0:34] says the lion will lie down with the
[0:36] lamb the Bible says the wolf shall lie
[0:38] down with the lamb but we know the lion
[0:39] is in the next uh phrase there in the
[0:41] scripture so it's possible the lion will
[0:44] lie down with the lamb I don't see why
[0:45] not
[0:46] but just want to be more scriptural by
[0:48] God's grace am Hallelujah verse four and
[0:52] I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and
[0:55] judgment was given unto them brother
[0:57] tells us that's the bride p and present
[1:00] amen and if the Lord carries future
[1:02] hallelujah amen hallelujah and I saw the
[1:05] souls of them that were beheaded for the
[1:08] witness of Jesus like St Paul and for
[1:10] the word of God the Old Testament Saints

[1:29] rubbing heads and and putting the I
[1:31] guess it's all the one mind of the Beast
[1:33] putting all their minds together with
[1:34] the the Beast mind that's fine I'm not
[1:37] going to rub my head with a PO Beast
[1:39] system Hallelujah I already got Jesus

[1:43] the Seal of God in my forehead

[3:57] we bring forth fruit in every season
[3:59] father so father we love you and bless
[4:01] us here tonight in Jesus Christ's name
[4:03] the Saints said amen amen God bless you
[4:06] as you're being seated praise
[4:13] God so I realized you know last week I
[4:16] uh when I preached on Millennium at my
[4:18] house you know um I realized I didn't
[4:20] really finish it so I went and studied
[4:22] there today of course I want to preach
[4:24] on the seven dimensions uh maybe Sunday
[4:26] by God's
[4:27] grace and uh if our live streamers uh I
[4:31] wasn't able to live stream that on
[4:32] Sunday night I didn't feel like I want
[4:33] to live stream it because we have a lot
[4:35] of uh uh questions from the the youth
[4:37] and I don't like to put their names out
[4:39] there on the internet and so forth I try
[4:41] not to by God's grace um anyways uh I I
[4:45] believe there's actually only two
[4:46] Dimensions I don't believe there's seven
[4:47] dimensions there's only two existences
[4:49] right you either you're either existing
[4:51] here in the natural world or you're
[4:52] existing in the spir spiritual world
[4:55] there's only two existences right uh but
[4:58] uh God's word is true Hallelujah amen
[5:00] and we're not going to disfellowship
[5:02] based on something small like that
[5:04] Hallelujah but God's word is true amen
[5:06] we're thankful for that so we looked at
[5:08] our text here and remember just two
[5:09] disclaimers about the Millennium uh
[5:11] brother R said it's hard for him to
[5:12] understand and he said he didn't have
[5:14] all the answers on it and of course
[5:16] there's no thus sayth the Lord on this
[5:17] subject and so you'll hear in 64
[5:20] questions and answers brother R say
[5:21] there's no sin in the Millennium right
[5:23] he'll say that but then he'll say
[5:25] there's sin before and sin after now if
[5:27] I use the same scriptures he used to
[5:30] teach it then there does say there is
[5:31] sin in the Millennium amen so I
[5:33] personally believe there is and if
[5:34] someone don't agree with me that's fine
[5:36] it doesn't really matter anyway let's
[5:37] just get to the Millennium praise God
[5:40] and the way we do that is love one
[5:41] another Hallelujah brother said only
[5:43] Divine love will make it over there
[5:45] hallelujah amen so if I'm wrong you and
[5:48] your love just love me into being right
[5:50] Hallelujah if I'm wrong just love me
[5:52] until I know I'm right Hallelujah and I
[5:53] can join your group on the Millennium or
[5:56] whatever topic people want to uh you
[5:59] know maybe
[6:00] dissociate on you know by God's grace
[6:02] but uh you know I can only preach it as
[6:03] I can see it you know by God's grace so
[6:06] again I just want to read this you know
[6:07] brother talk he's talking about marriage
[6:08] and divorce and I hope this is true
[6:10] brother remember if you got the wrong
[6:11] person you'll get the right one in the
[6:13] Millennium you just keep on going all
[6:15] wrongs will be made right there so here
[6:18] you know I'd like to study this this is
[6:19] an interesting thought now the way to
[6:21] study this would be look at permissive
[6:23] will of God when did certain Saints get
[6:25] out of the permissive will of God but
[6:27] then God brought them back in amen so I
[6:30] can think of people like Jonah I can
[6:31] think of people like
[6:33] Hezekiah that purposely got in the by
[6:36] their own choice I mean in the
[6:38] permissive will of God and if they made
[6:39] mistakes in that realm God would make it
[6:42] right in the Millennium so I can't think
[6:44] of any right now off the bat I'm sure my
[6:46] wife will be thinking real deep on that
[6:47] you know by God's grace and we can have
[6:49] some good conversations about that and
[6:51] if you have one question about that
[6:53] bring it Sunday night by God's grace but
[6:55] I just love it I love how brother says
[6:57] everything will be made right in the
[6:58] millennium why because it's God's
[7:00] seventh day yes it's God's day of rest
[7:03] and it's the honeymoon for the husband
[7:05] and the wife amen Christ and the church
[7:08] hallelujah it's that Divine honeymoon
[7:11] where where the husband and wife reain
[7:13] for a thousand years amen oh it's going
[7:15] to be a grand time Hallelujah now if you
[7:17] got your Bibles I guess you know don't
[7:19] have to really turn to them here tonight
[7:20] because I got them up here on the screen
[7:21] for you I figured out how to switch over
[7:23] aren't you glad for technology M it was
[7:25] so easy I kind of kicked myself from not
[7:27] doing it sooner but uh What uh what I
[7:29] can't do everything you know so let's
[7:32] look at some more Millennium verses you
[7:33] know um I found some more by God's grace
[7:36] and at the end I want to just make some
[7:38] proofs that we're not in the Millennium
[7:39] I have five proofs that we're clearly
[7:40] not in the Millennium of course there's
[7:42] way more right but I can just clearly
[7:45] show five you know we used to have a
[7:46] brother named Loris who went to our
[7:47] church here God bless brother Loris but
[7:49] his mom believed we were living in the
[7:51] Millennium W uh while her whole life she
[7:54] believed we're in the Millennium and so
[7:56] brother Loris brought that question to
[7:57] me and I went and studied it that's why
[7:58] I preached this back in 2016 I said
[8:01] brother I said you know nothing against
[8:02] your dear mother but here's the reasons
[8:05] I don't believe we're in the Millennium
[8:06] we haven't walked on the ashes of the
[8:08] wicked amen uh Satan's still around here
[8:11] all all the time amen I fight him and
[8:13] his demons every day yes sir so I know
[8:15] we're not in the Millennium because in
[8:16] the Millennium you won't see them amen
[8:18] right we see Satan all over these
[8:19] politicians we see Satan all over these
[8:22] uh oh my these sodomites you know you
[8:25] just you start naming them you know all
[8:28] the sins so is clearly here he's not the
[8:30] bottomless pit so uh there's so many
[8:33] proofs but you know uh not not to not to
[8:36] be disagreeable but just just to be kind
[8:39] and and stand where we believe we must
[8:41] stand Hallelujah and to recognize we're
[8:43] not the Millennium brother says it
[8:44] plainly of course but you know uh uh
[8:47] Psalm 22 I just love this about God God
[8:49] hides these things all throughout the
[8:51] Old Testament that's why the Bible said
[8:53] when you teach something it's got to be
[8:54] line upon line here a little there a
[8:57] little amen right jar here's a little
[8:59] Jeremiah 3 here's a little more in Psalm
[9:01] 22 amen there's a little bit more in
[9:04] Isaiah 65 amen Isaiah 2 Isaiah 11
[9:08] Hallelujah here a little there a little
[9:09] amen but the same Holy Spirit finds all
[9:12] these different portions and puts it
[9:13] together for one thought Hallelujah and
[9:16] then you can like brother said it's like
[9:17] a puzzle amen he said if you're not
[9:19] careful these denominational preachers
[9:21] put the puzzle together they got the cow
[9:23] on top of the tree yes amen he said but
[9:25] we need the cow on the ground amen we
[9:28] need the pzz plac right together
[9:30] Hallelujah that we can see the whole
[9:32] plan of God Amen that's why God said
[9:35] brother R to finish the mystery of God
[9:37] so we can see what God is doing in this
[9:39] hour
[9:40] amen by so here we again see all the
[9:44] ends of the world shall remember and
[9:46] turn into the Lord so this see
[9:48] denominational use this and they say see
[9:50] there's going to be a big time
[9:52] Revival the whole world they think we're
[9:54] going to turn the whole world to Christ
[9:56] before the Rapture that's where they're
[9:58] wrong amen see but see how they miss see
[10:01] how they misplace it right there said
[10:03] don't misapply it don't misinterpret and
[10:05] don't misplace it yes sir Hallelujah so
[10:08] see they misplace it it gives them a
[10:10] false hope yes and it causes them
[10:13] actually to compromise because they
[10:15] think by compromising and joining up
[10:17] with the Pope they think that's
[10:18] fulfilling that but it's not amen it's
[10:21] actually fulfilling the other side the
[10:23] fall of the mother Harlot church amen
[10:25] and the daughters amen Amen brother or
[10:28] Jesus said I'm going to cast the
[10:30] children in with the mother yes sir
[10:32] they're uniting they're going back it's
[10:34] the uh the the iron and the clay and the
[10:36] feet amen right of the beast in Daniel
[10:38] chapter 2 it's that uniting together
[10:40] Hallelujah but we're not a part of that
[10:42] amen amen hallelujah glory to
[10:44] God and all the kinds of the Nations
[10:47] shall worship before thee there's going
[10:49] to come a time when all the world
[10:51] worships Christ amen but it ain't now
[10:54] amen the next thing they're going to
[10:55] worship is the Antichrist yes right
[10:57] they're all going to worship the
[10:58] Antichrist
[10:59] they're going to worship the image of
[11:00] the Beast right the the the church
[11:02] system and then the Antichrist is going
[11:04] to raise up and solve all those problems
[11:06] we preach on right we have to go back
[11:07] and preach that to refresh you I like to
[11:08] be a little refreshed on that too by
[11:10] God's grace verse 28 for the kingdom is
[11:13] the Lord's and he's the governor among
[11:15] the Nations oh what a governor amen
[11:17] hallelujah we tried to vote this current
[11:18] governor out but we missed it but
[11:20] they're not going to be able to vote
[11:21] Jesus out Hallelujah because God
[11:23] ordained him there amen hallelujah so
[11:27] see friends this hasn't happened yet so
[11:28] these just scatter look like to us
[11:30] they're just like scattered oh like a
[11:32] sewer amen sewing the word of God he
[11:34] just sews it out there and there's all
[11:36] these scriptures on different thoughts
[11:37] all scattered out but it takes the Holy
[11:39] Spirit to put them together amen that
[11:41] ought to prove to you as another proof
[11:43] that God sent brother ROM to restore the
[11:45] Bible amen oh it's undeniable like I
[11:48] told those uh the people that are
[11:50] against brother Bram the accusers I said
[11:51] if if William Bram didn't fulfill
[11:53] Revelation 10:7 then who did that's
[11:55] right amen who did right cuz it can't be
[11:58] a Heavenly angel it's got to be a man
[12:00] amen now you start naming people I'll
[12:02] show you how they were off the word and
[12:04] none of them gave thus sayith the Lord
[12:06] Brother come around and he told us what
[12:07] it was and then he said that's thus say
[12:09] the Lord yes sir and all of our major
[12:12] doctrines go right back to the Bible it
[12:14] proves God is in this message Hallelujah
[12:17] he's restoring Hallelujah glory to God
[12:19] he's restoring he's finished the mystery
[12:21] now we're eating the book and
[12:22] prophesying again amen hallelujah I love
[12:25] to prophesy again share the prophecies
[12:28] God gave us amen mhm you probably
[12:30] remember this one for us this a
[12:31] Christmas verse we'd say right the child
[12:34] is born a son is given the government
[12:35] shall be upon his shoulder now of course
[12:37] that's speaking of Millennium too I
[12:38] could put that one up there too and his
[12:39] name should be called wonderful isn't he
[12:41] wonderful to you amen counselor is he
[12:43] your counselor is he the Mighty God the
[12:45] everlas the Everlasting Father the Son
[12:47] is the father Yes these two are one
[12:50] Hallelujah not three not not these three
[12:53] are three persons these three
[12:55] manifestations are one Hallelujah said
[12:58] the good word is a offes these three
[13:00] offices are one the Prince of Peace So
[13:03] if you need peace just go to Jesus
[13:04] tonight
[13:05] amen of the increase of his government
[13:08] and peace there shall be no end so his
[13:10] kingdom just keeps expanding amen so
[13:13] again the denomination of churches will
[13:14] say well this is a Revival in America
[13:16] sorry it's not it's for the Millennium
[13:19] amen he said upon the throne of David
[13:22] and upon his kingdom to order it and to
[13:24] establish it with judgment and with
[13:26] Justice from henceforth even forever the
[13:29] Zeal of the Lord will perform this amen
[13:33] God's jealousy right it's a holy
[13:36] jealousy amen God's jealousy for his
[13:39] bride to rule amen amen he wants his
[13:41] bride ruling on this Earth amen his
[13:44] jealousy for his bride to be treated the
[13:45] right way and to reign with him his
[13:47] jealousy will accomplish this amen
[13:50] hallelujah talk about the favor of God
[13:52] hallelujah again this hasn't happened
[13:54] but now we see Jesus connected to ruling
[13:57] on the throne of David amen remember he
[13:59] got this prophecy uh right before he was
[14:02] born it was told to his mother Mary and
[14:05] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[14:06] and bring forth the son and shall call
[14:08] his name Jesus Jehovah is our Salvation
[14:10] he shall be great he shall be called the
[14:12] son of the highest and the Lord God
[14:14] shall give unto him the Throne of his
[14:16] father David
[14:19] Hallelujah and he shall reign over the
[14:21] house of Jacob
[14:23] forever right they rejected him when he
[14:25] was here first but you and I received
[14:27] him amen to them that received him he
[14:30] gave power to become the sons of God
[14:33] hallelujah thank you Lord and of his
[14:35] kingdom there shall be no end hallelujah
[14:38] amen he was promised as Throne of David
[14:41] and remember Satan tried to give it to
[14:42] him early but Jesus was smarter than
[14:44] that oh he can't the devil can't deceive
[14:47] this one Hallelujah he could trick all
[14:49] the other ones but he couldn't trick
[14:51] Jesus Hallelujah CU he was the word amen
[14:54] amen see that's how God helps us to
[14:56] overcome that's why we can't be deceived
[14:58] because because we're a part of the word
[15:00] amen Cam and I were talking today and
[15:02] we're just like we're so thankful you
[15:03] know we see all these people falling we
[15:05] see all these churches getting false
[15:06] Doctrine but we said brother C said
[15:08] thank God that the elect cannot be
[15:10] deceived thank God that we cannot be
[15:12] deceived into sin and debauchery and and
[15:15] falling away and and going and taking Le
[15:17] I'm going to preach on Le pretty soon by
[15:19] God's grace we won't take any Le in the
[15:21] church Hallelujah the Holy Ghost cleans
[15:23] out the Le cuz we keep asking him to
[15:25] clean it out amen hallelujah oh it's
[15:29] glorious remember this a picture here
[15:31] now remember I preached this a few years
[15:33] ago this is not set in stone because
[15:35] what I mean is even in Jesus Earthly
[15:37] Ministry he was called Son of God and
[15:39] Son of David he even called himself the
[15:41] Son of God during his Earthly Ministry
[15:43] but it's it's just a a simple it's like
[15:45] a framework just to understand that he
[15:48] has at least three forms or sorry three
[15:50] offices again yes sir he's son of man
[15:53] Prophet Son of God high priest in heaven
[15:56] and Son of David ruling during the
[15:59] hallelujah amen and giving you a crown
[16:02] giving you Dominion giving you cities to
[16:04] re over amen that's
[16:07] right so on Earth he was the prophet
[16:10] right that's the Rich Young Ruler heimr
[16:12] Hoffman painted that around late 1800s
[16:15] beautiful picture that's that's that's
[16:17] the closest thing I've ever seen to what
[16:19] I saw Jesus Christ in a vision twice
[16:21] amen said that's the closest I've
[16:24] seen now here's where we have the great
[16:26] Revelation here right now the body of
[16:29] Jesus Christ is in the holiest of holies
[16:31] making intercession for us the Bible
[16:33] says that Hebrews 10 amen and brother
[16:36] said there's got to be blood somewhere
[16:38] up there in heaven amen so somehow God's
[16:40] got physical blood of Jesus in a
[16:42] spiritual Heavenly Holly of holies amen
[16:45] now wrap your brain around that try to
[16:47] explain that to me but brother said
[16:49] there has to be a blood that's there for
[16:52] a sin offer amen hallelujah else we
[16:54] can't be saved amen there's got to be
[16:56] Blood Of The Mercy Seat thank God
[16:59] there's blood on The Mercy Seat
[17:00] tonight there's Mercy for us tonight see

[20:51] what the Bible says and look at look at
[20:53] the last words go to Ezekiel I don't
[20:55] have in my notes but I had it last week
[20:57] go to Ezekiel 48 the last chapter of
[21:02] Ezekiel Isaiah Jeremiah
[21:05] Ezekiel I've been looking at Lin's
[21:08] pictures boy he's quite an artist what a
[21:09] man he was my goodness for a Baptist I
[21:11] tell you he that's amazing Revelation
[21:12] for a Baptist but that's right that was
[21:14] the man age so he had the he had the
[21:15] anointing for the man age what an artist
[21:17] my look at the last verse verse 35
[21:20] Ezekiel 48:35 it was round about 18,000
[21:23] measures and the name of the city from
[21:26] that day shall be the Lord is is here
[21:29] amen oh that's what that's what the name
[21:32] is the Lord is here hallelujah amen oh
[21:36] isn't Jehovah sh the Lord is with us
[21:38] hallelujah so be very similar to that
[21:40] very similar to Jehovah sh amen what do
[21:42] you call that house Jehovah sh amen God
[21:45] is here amen
[21:47] hallelujah and what did I told this to
[21:50] brother Rod I was standing by Charles
[21:51] finny's grave last week brother what a
[21:53] man of God he was amen hallelujah still
[21:55] got the denominations of his day and he
[21:57] blasted it he still like a gallant
[21:59] Soldier Hallelujah of the Cross but John
[22:01] Wesley's last words were the best part
[22:04] is the Lord is with us hallelujah and
[22:07] then he said it one more time before he
[22:08] died took one more breath he said the
[22:10] best part is the Lord is with us and
[22:12] then he his soul went to his Heavenly
[22:14] reward hallelujah hallelujah and he said
[22:18] the best thing is the Lord is with us
[22:20] but in the Millennium everybody will say
[22:22] the Lord is there Hallelujah the
[22:25] Corporal body is there hallelujah amen
[22:28] so now we got got a good understanding
[22:29] of it now there's the size of the future
[22:31] home we'll get to that later that's not
[22:32] a really guess I guess the the angle if
[22:35] you measured out uh 1,500 miles that's
[22:39] how big the future home
[22:42] is right it's just a little bit short of
[22:44] that and then of course that's what the
[22:45] future home looks like but remember
[22:47] there's no more seat so the artist got
[22:48] it I mean these could be Lakes I mean I
[22:49] don't know God has a different way to
[22:51] define it and that's about the size
[22:53] where it will be present day that's
[22:54] where the future home now not the
[22:55] Millennium the future home now the mill
[22:58] IAL Temple will be right there too we're

[24:26] shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom
[24:28] which shall never be destroyed amen and
[24:31] the kingdom shall not be left to other
[24:33] people but it shall break in pieces and
[24:36] consume all these other kingdoms right
[24:38] Rome yes sir and all the kingdoms of
[24:39] this world Russia China America and it
[24:42] shall stand forever amen for as much as
[24:44] thou sawest now I'm not going to read

[24:53] the demon powers right of Rome
[24:56] Hallelujah I love this I love what told
[24:58] D Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar the
[25:01] interpretation therefore is sure amen
[25:04] but Peter said we've got a more sure
[25:06] word of Prophecy Hallelujah in other
[25:09] words it becomes a moreal reality we're
[25:12] closer to this being fulfilled
[25:13] Hallelujah Peter's like we're more we
[25:15] got a more sure word because we saw
[25:17] Jesus I've seen him with my own eyes
[25:19] Hallelujah I've seen him with prophetic
[25:21] eyes I've seen him in a trans Hallelujah
[25:24] that's what he saw Mount Transfiguration
[25:25] Jesus said tell this Vision to no man oh
[25:28] there's the blending in of the other
[25:30] dimension hallelujah praise God that
[25:32] Dimension Blends in and Peter James and
[25:34] John they see a vision up on Mount
[25:36] Transfiguration Moses and Elijah talking
[25:39] to Jesus
[25:40] hallelujah amen Moses represented the
[25:43] dead in Christ but you represent Elijah
[25:45] if we live to the coming if we live to
[25:47] the Rapture amen cuz Elijah never died
[25:50] hallelujah amen he he got to go to
[25:53] heaven without dying he represents those
[25:55] that are alive and remain that are
[25:57] caught up to meet the Lord in the air
[26:00] anybody remember Simon preaching that
[26:01] did he teach that here I thought he
[26:03] preached about Transfiguration while I
[26:05] was out okay remember that Moses
[26:07] represents the dead in Christ Elijah
[26:09] represents us if we live to see it and
[26:11] we're raptured up amen amen right Jesus
[26:14] is Jesus hallelujah amen our husband
[26:19] amen now this is quite a scripture I saw
[26:22] the night visions and behold one like
[26:23] the son of man came with the clouds of
[26:25] heaven and came to the Ancient of Days
[26:27] and they brought him near before now
[26:28] this is Jesus after he resurrected right
[26:33] and this is him coming to the throne of
[26:34] God so here we see son coming to the
[26:37] father amen that shouldn't stumble
[26:39] anybody because God's so great you can't
[26:41] even contain him amen no wonder he's
[26:43] called the Ancient of Days he never had
[26:44] the first day to start hallelujah
[26:46] amen right and the Bible said the
[26:49] father's invisible GL amen so the the
[26:52] visible son uh is who's the image of God
[26:55] comes to the invisible God amen amen
[26:59] Hallelujah that shouldn't but see
[27:00] trinitarian oh there's two persons well
[27:02] show me where the Bible ever says
[27:03] there's two persons it doesn't say that
[27:05] amen hallelujah one's God is invisible
[27:08] right and his son is visible hallelujah
[27:10] amen amen and there was given him
[27:13] dominion and glory and a kingdom that
[27:15] all people there it is again all
[27:18] people see you got to see these same
[27:20] words all the time all nations all
[27:22] people languages should serve him see
[27:25] they're not doing it right now amen
[27:28] serving Jesus no no his Dominion is an
[27:32] everlasting Dominion which shall not
[27:35] pass away and his kingdom that which
[27:36] shall not be destroyed
[27:39] amen
[27:41] now now I I don't want to get into this
[27:43] but if you just if you read early in the
[27:44] chapter the Bible says the ancient of
[27:46] days has has white hair like white wool
[27:49] and eyes like fire well that's
[27:51] Christ right so what we see we see God
[27:54] changing his Mas amen the Bible said he
[27:56] Chang changes his form Philippians 2:6
[27:59] says he became in the form of a servant
[28:01] amen and that means you change your
[28:03] external
[28:04] appearance right so that's what God does
[28:06] all the time he goes from a pillar of
[28:08] fire right children remember the mass
[28:09] lessons we did a couple years ago yes
[28:12] sir he takes the pillar of fire he takes
[28:14] that mask on he puts on the body of
[28:15] Jesus amen he took that mask off he put
[28:17] on
[28:18] nezic right you can you can keep
[28:20] changing all the mask well here Ancient
[28:22] of Days takes off that mask amen amen
[28:25] amen he's changing his appearance but
[28:27] it's the same person person behind the
[28:28] mask hallelujah amen hallelujah
[28:32] Glory here's a new one maybe you haven't
[28:34] seen this one lately but the Saints I
[28:36] love this of the most high shall take
[28:38] the kingdom and possess the kingdom
[28:40] forever even forever and ever that's a
[28:42] thousand years amen until the Ancient of
[28:45] Days came and judgment was given to the
[28:46] Saints of the most high there it is who
[28:48] is Judgment given to you amen if you can
[28:52] judge the situations now amen that's why
[28:55] it's so important where your home church
[28:57] is amen and how you treat people yes Cam
[29:00] was telling me you know where they live
[29:01] some not not not not everybody but some
[29:03] people they jump from one Church to get
[29:05] one problem they jump to the other
[29:06] church that's a that's a nice part we
[29:08] don't have many churches close to here
[29:10] because somebody don't agree with me
[29:11] it's hard for them to jump to another
[29:13] church and it's usually something very
[29:15] small yes sir right because by God's
[29:18] grace I've live blameless before the
[29:19] people amen hallelujah that's what the
[29:22] Bible said a pastor has to be blameless
[29:23] amen before the people but see that
[29:26] other places you know where there's lots
[29:27] of churches they can jump around and
[29:28] brother say you'll take your sin from
[29:30] that church to the next Church how many
[29:32] times have we seen it
[29:35] m in fact what's interesting sometimes
[29:37] they they jump around so much that they
[29:38] all go to the same
[29:40] church and then you got lots of problems
[29:42] in that church and a lot of false
[29:43] Doctrine amen that's right y but see if
[29:47] they can't judge these small little
[29:48] matters how are they going to judge the
[29:50] real matters amen they're not brother
[29:53] brother said if you don't catch in these
[29:54] little things he said the Rapture is
[29:56] going to go right over your head you're
[29:57] going to miss it you can't catch you the
[29:59] simple things of the Gospel amen right
[30:01] remember we had that verse Paul said it
[30:04] it should be you should have such a
[30:05] sphere of the Holy Ghost that even the
[30:07] least of the church members could judge
[30:09] something right amen that's probably the
[30:11] children yes even children if they got
[30:14] the Holy Ghost can judge a dispute
[30:16] between people amen right he said if you
[30:19] can't judge those you won't judge over
[30:21] there amen see why we got to be able to
[30:23] have the spirit of judgment hallelujah
[30:24] amen amen oh I love it but the Saints
[30:28] are given the kingdom hallelujah amen
[30:31] the holy ones that's what the Hebrew
[30:33] word means the holy ones are given the
[30:35] kingdom oh verse 27 and the kingdom and
[30:39] dominion and the greatness of the
[30:40] Kingdom Under the whole Heaven shall be
[30:42] given to the people of the Saints of the
[30:44] most high whose kingdom is an
[30:46] everlasting Kingdom and all dominions
[30:48] Shall Serve and Obey him that's that
[30:50] hasn't happened yet it's not happening
[30:52] now it's going to happen in the
[30:53] Millennium hallelujah amen oh church
[30:56] I'll tell you what I just want to be a
[30:58] saint amen if all these promises are to
[31:00] the Saints God I just want to be one of
[31:02] them
[31:03] amen I don't care if I'm the least of
[31:05] them I just want to be a Holy One
[31:07] Hallelujah yes I just want to be
[31:09] separated
[31:11] amen
[31:13] amen like like brother said if you're
[31:16] least in the kingdom of God he said then
[31:18] you still got every demon under your
[31:20] feet because if you're the least in the
[31:21] Kingdom of the body of Christ and you're
[31:23] the feet amen but if you're in the body
[31:25] you're still above every demon power
[31:28] amen like Paul told those Romans Satan
[31:30] will be bruised shortly under your feet
[31:32] hallelujah
[31:34] amen now notice Church look at all these
[31:37] verses I'm showing you tonight they all
[31:38] say the same thing that's what brother R
[31:40] said every
[31:41] Doctrine must be based on the word of
[31:43] God it not just one place but from
[31:45] Genesis to Revelation it must say the
[31:47] same thing yeah see that's why these

[32:04] everything it's all saying the same
[32:06] thing hallelujah amen the Holy Ghost is

[32:11] contradicting himself the Holy Ghost
[32:12] guides us into all truth hallelujah amen

[34:16] Mount Mariah would be where the Dome of
[34:18] the Rock is that Shrine for the Muslims
[34:20] I'm going to show the picture a little
[34:21] bit but Mount Zion is further west it's
[34:25] it's only a few feet higher you know
[34:27] elevation right now but the Bible said
[34:29] it's going to raise up God's going to
[34:32] raise up a mountain out of the mountain
[34:34] that's in Isaiah chapter 2 probably
[34:36] don't remember that this guy to preach
[34:37] it a long time ago but see you have
[34:39] Mount Mariah that's where Christ is
[34:41] crucified amen then you have Mount Zion
[34:44] it's a higher Mountain yes sir and this
[34:46] is the mountain we've been singing about
[34:49] amen why is that a special Mountain
[34:51] because Jesus is going to come back and
[34:52] stand on that mountain amen and 144,000
[34:55] Holy Ghost Saints are going to get the
[34:57] Holy Ghost there amen Israeli Saints on
[34:59] that mountain amen no wonder my mom felt
[35:02] so good when she went to Israel praise
[35:04] God your mom did too
[35:06] H because that everyone knows Jesus is
[35:08] coming back there amen he's coming back
[35:10] Hallelujah just like he said amen amen
[35:13] yeah the Mount of ol the kid Valley
[35:15] Mount Mariah Mount
[35:17] Zion so there's the elevation so see uh
[35:21] Mariah is where they're going to rebuild
[35:22] the Temple it's 2400 Mount Zion's 2500
[35:27] this about 100 ft higher wow they said
[35:29] olives is tall that that's just for now
[35:31] right that's just for now it's going to
[35:33] raise up later Isaiah 2 says
[35:35] it so so see if you're looking from this
[35:38] is from the East looking West this is
[35:40] not the right angle I'll show you later
[35:41] but here's Mount olives this is highest
[35:43] the highest point right there's the
[35:44] valley and there's the shrine now that
[35:46] that's where uh that's where uh
[35:50] Solomon's Temple used to be right in
[35:52] here right now Zion's up here right so
[35:57] you have mount
[35:58] you have Mount Mariah you have Mount
[36:00] Zion and here you have Mount of oliv
[36:02] that's the modern day view of it if you
[36:03] went there right and this is and this is
[36:06] where they think you know that's going
[36:07] to have to be broken down according to
[36:09] Revelation 11 they think and Israel's
[36:10] going to have to build their third
[36:11] Temple there yeah so here's if you're
[36:14] looking at it again the same direction
[36:16] here's Mount
[36:17] Mariah right where Christ was crucified
[36:19] and here's Mount Zion but if you turn it
[36:21] North uh if you're looking at from the
[36:23] north you have Mount Mari on this side
[36:26] and here's Mount Zion if you're look at
[36:27] just at a map so if you're looking at a
[36:29] map this is what it would look like to
[36:30] you see CU there there's North up there
[36:32] north south east west okay so Mount Zion
[36:37] the Bible said they'll remember in
[36:38] habach they'll flow into Zion amen
[36:41] they'll flow in and worship God on Zion
[36:44] amen
[36:46] hallelujah and there's a there's a a
[36:48] picture comparison so that's that that's
[36:51] Mount Mari where the Dome of the Rock is
[36:52] that's where we believe Israel is going
[36:53] to build their third Temple but Mount
[36:55] Zion is where Jesus comes back in this
[36:56] place mhm
[36:58] Jesus comes back he's going to stand
[36:59] over there see you can fit about 144,000
[37:01] people there by God's grace
[37:03] hallelujah amen where does it say that
[37:06] Revelation 14:1 and I looked and lo a
[37:09] lamb stood on the Mount Zion and with
[37:11] him 144,000 having their father's name
[37:14] written their foreheads we just come out
[37:16] of Father's Day amen and your father's
[37:18] name is going to be in your forehead
[37:20] Hallelujah who's your daddy the Lord God
[37:22] is my dad Hallelujah he's your father
[37:25] amen you were chosen in him before the
[37:26] foundation of the world he's literally
[37:29] coming to that mountain amen
[37:32] hallelujah now just to just so you might
[37:35] have heard this before I might have even
[37:36] preached this before but there's one
[37:38] quote where brother said the heathens
[37:40] that never heard the gospel will be
[37:41] raised up during the Millennium now I
[37:43] personally don't agree with this anymore
[37:44] and I'll show you why but it's still a
[37:46] possibility because I'm not God Amen but
[37:49] there's a quote just so you know it's
[37:50] from 1962 questions and answers and the
[37:53] he that that's never heard the gospel
[37:55] shall be raised in that time talking
[37:56] about the millennium and the sons of God
[37:58] will be manifested if he's to Reign he's
[38:00] got to have something to Reign Over he's
[38:01] got a domain and they rule to reign with
[38:03] Christ and Christ ruled with a rod of
[38:05] iron with the Nations then the gospel
[38:07] the Manifest the sons of God with the
[38:08] authority just like he had when he was
[38:10] here there will come the Millennium in
[38:12] that Reign upon the ashes of the wicked
[38:14] amen hallelujah amen that's why I've
[38:17] said you know think I've said over the
[38:18] years maybe God will raise up uh all
[38:20] those babies that were aborted and give
[38:21] them a chance I don't know right their
[38:23] souls are somewhere we know that right
[38:26] David's son that passed away he said I'm
[38:29] going to him amen that would be the
[38:31] sixth Dimension now that time would have
[38:32] been Paradise in the heart of the Earth
[38:33] but now it's in heaven amen right yes
[38:37] sir now here's why I don't believe it'll
[38:39] be the heathens that never heard because
[38:42] Hebrews 9:27 says it's pointed unto men
[38:45] once to die then the Judgment
[38:49] amen and then you that that's one
[38:51] witness now you got two witnesses down
[38:52] here remember these verses say all men
[38:54] are without excuse on the day of
[38:55] judgment yes sir so people got chance to
[38:57] hear and they got a chance to have uh uh
[39:00] what do they call the age of
[39:02] accountability which is not in the Bible
[39:04] but we understand it's a Bible principle
[39:05] amen if they got to that and they they
[39:08] failed to receive it then there's no
[39:10] excuses amen
[39:13] right all right so see I don't believe
[39:15] that the the people that lived and died
[39:17] will be raised up to live again I I
[39:19] believe it'll be just uh uh it'll be The
[39:22] Offspring of the people that survived
[39:23] during the battle of Armageddon that's
[39:25] it amen that's what Zechariah 14 say too
[39:27] brother we went last week if you're
[39:29] interested U Zechariah 14 that blew my
[39:31] mind I'm like wow that's been laying
[39:32] there all those years and I sir it just
[39:34] proves there's a time and season for
[39:36] everything amen there's a time and
[39:37] season for every Revelation hallelujah
[39:40] amen all right now
[39:42] um just I want to show this again here
[39:44] so the children know this especially and
[39:45] adults if you if you don't know
[39:47] this brother bam said that today is not
[39:50] the Lord's day that's right it's not
[39:52] Saturday or Sunday that's right he said
[39:54] today is certainly not the Lord's day
[39:56] this is man's day it's man's doing man's
[39:58] work man's Church man's idea of worship
[40:00] man's everything for it's man's world
[40:02] Cosmos but the day of the Lord is coming
[40:04] yes it is it's just that at this time of
[40:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ John was
[40:09] taken up by the spirit and transported
[40:11] by the spirit to that great day that's
[40:12] coming the Lord's day was when the days
[40:15] of man are over amen so it has to be
[40:17] after Armageddon amen and then that
[40:20] would be the start of the millennial
[40:21] amen right the day of the Lord and a day
[40:24] with the Lord is a thousand years with
[40:26] man yes amen
[40:29] right so we can see it the kingdoms of
[40:30] this world will then become the kingdoms
[40:32] of our God Amen oh Jesus ruling every
[40:36] Kingdom oh what a day that's going to be
[40:37] amen the day of the Lord is when the
[40:39] judgments fall and after that comes the
[40:42] Millennium right the judgments of the
[40:44] sword coming out of his mouth right yes

[41:04] seven years all the tanks planes guns

[46:38] plenty of quotes here to look at here my
[46:39] go guys so here I'm closing with this
[46:43] here now there's way more proofs we're
[46:45] not in the Millennium now but I want to
[46:46] go through five there's way
[46:49] more and and and most of them uh most of
[46:53] them on here are ones I've already
[46:54] preached but now think about all the
[46:55] verses I preached last Wednesday at my
[46:57] house and then all the verses I'm
[46:59] talking about from the Old Testament
[47:00] think about all those Old Testament
[47:01] verses and every one of those that says
[47:04] all nations and all these things and
[47:05] everybody will worship and everybody the
[47:07] the the glory of the Lord will will fill
[47:09] the Earth all those are proofs we not in
[47:11] the Millennium right right
[47:16] yes what about all those sacrifices
[47:18] Ezekiel wrote about all the animal
[47:19] sacrifices there's no animal sacrifices
[47:21] going on right now amen I'll just say
[47:24] this I I said brother Loris I felt sorry
[47:25] for your mom
[47:27] but she's wrong amen we're not in the
[47:29] Millennium now Hallelujah y I'm not I
[47:33] mean I rest a little bit during the
[47:34] summer but I don't get much rest other
[47:36] than that it's a time of rest when I'm
[47:39] in a perfect
[47:40] body say't no perfect body amen I wish
[47:43] it was five PR were not the Millennium
[47:46] now the wolf and lamb do not lay down
[47:48] together in peace now see you could you
[47:50] could go with a child does not lead a
[47:53] snake remember the Bible said a child
[47:54] lead a ass that's not happening now amen
[47:58] so there's hundreds of reasons we're not
[48:00] in the Millennium amen I'm just giving
[48:02] you five there's hundreds
[48:06] right number two you and I have not
[48:08] walked on the ashes of the entire Wicked
[48:11] population amen that's been burned over
[48:13] with the sword that came out of jesus'
[48:15] mouth
[48:17] amen see how insane people would have to
[48:19] be to think we're in the Millennium I
[48:20] mean and no shade on brother uh L's M
[48:23] she probably just she probably don't
[48:24] study like I do or preachers do do MH
[48:28] right she she just don't study right if
[48:31] you study God can reveal something to
[48:33] you amen if you don't study God can't
[48:35] reveal things to you yes
[48:37] sir it's just that's just how it is and
[48:40] sometimes you got to wait decades I had
[48:41] to wait over a decade uh I had wait a
[48:44] decade brother to get the Revelation
[48:46] brother Ram said when the seals were
[48:48] broken the serpent seed was revealed and
[48:51] brother I was like yes I love brother
[48:53] brandom I love the Bible but I don't
[48:55] understand this for 10 years
[48:57] and all of a sudden I'm driving to
[48:58] church holding my wife's hand and it
[49:00] dropped down from heaven thank you Lord
[49:03] that's right the serpent seed is in
[49:05] Revelation
[49:07] 5 because the kins and Redeemer could
[49:09] only been virgin born amen there
[49:13] amen I just said Glory struck me I
[49:17] didn't shout that loud but I was like
[49:19] smiling I think that's right and it is
[49:23] right hallelujah amen it had to be a
[49:25] virgin birth amen the Virgin birth had
[49:29] to undo whatever happened in the garden
[49:32] amen yes that's right now I got that
[49:34] from another preacher that's not for me
[49:36] because I always want to cite my sources
[49:38] now Revelation 5 that was the lord gave
[49:40] that to me amen but whatever happened
[49:43] the garden It could only be undone by a
[49:45] virgin Hallelujah God Amen that's right
[49:49] these denominational people you ask you
[49:51] ask them ask a denomination person uh
[49:53] why did Jesus have to be born virgin
[49:54] birth they have no idea well they say
[49:56] well you know he had to be sinless well
[49:57] why why amen because sin came in the
[50:00] world through a an act amen that type of
[50:04] act amen
[50:07] right amen so the Virgin birth was the
[50:10] cure to the uh the sin that entered in
[50:13] in the garden Hallelujah sir amen that's
[50:15] right amen virginity was the solution to
[50:18] the corruption that happened in the
[50:19] garden and even Paul said it Paul said
[50:21] I'm so surprised that Corinthians you're
[50:24] so soon removed from the gospel as Eve
[50:27] was beguiled by The Serpent and lost her
[50:29] virginity I've espoused you as a virgin
[50:31] church but I'm so concerned your minds
[50:33] are corrupted like e virginity was
[50:36] corrupted amen hallelujah how how much
[50:38] PL could it be amen amen it's hiding in
[50:41] plain sight they say Amen howy in plain
[50:44] sight CU people are so
[50:45] blind thank God for the isow of the Holy
[50:48] GH cuz I would not have seen it either
[50:50] unless God put that I out on me
[50:52] Hallelujah that grease amen amen
[50:58] Satan's still here on the Earth right
[51:00] but during the Millennium he's in the
[51:02] bottomless
[51:05] pit the Millennium is complete peace now
[51:07] we know there's now we as we read some
[51:10] scripture um that means there's no Wars
[51:13] the Bible said they'll learn not to War
[51:15] and the Bible said they'll turn all
[51:16] their weapons into like hoes and rakes
[51:19] and all kinds of uh garden garden uh
[51:23] utensils or whatever more garden tools
[51:24] there is garden tools
[51:27] because Jesus is ruling as the son of
[51:31] David okay now see that so even I got to
[51:34] correct that one because the Bible says
[51:36] there are sinners let me pull that up
[51:38] there just so our viewers can see that
[51:40] uh because I know I might get criticized
[51:42] on the comments that's that's you know
[51:45] if you're too hot for the kitchen get
[51:46] out of the kitchen right if it's too hot
[51:48] for you get out of the kitchen I mean I
[51:49] can handle it um I got the Bible I know
[51:51] what I believe I'm not ashamed I'm not
[51:53] ashamed of what I preach amen I study I
[51:56] wait on God I've got a Bible verse I've
[51:58] got quotes too hallelujah
[52:01] amen
[52:03] Sinners so it must be
[52:07] sinner yeah it was right there brother
[52:10] brother even cited it yeah brother even
[52:11] read it Isaiah 65 sorry uh
[52:16] 20 for the child shall die 100 years old
[52:19] but the sinner being 100 years old shall
[52:22] be a curse yes so when one of these uh
[52:24] people die from the Nations 100 years
[52:27] old is going to look like they're cursed
[52:29] now remember they can get the Bible said
[52:31] they'll get plagues brother and be
[52:32] punished if they don't come up and
[52:33] worship God Amen if they don't get to
[52:35] come to the the feast and Tabernacles
[52:37] God will instantly punish them amen I
[52:39] wish he did it now by God's grace but
[52:41] God's I guess God's God's very merciful
[52:43] right now amen okay so see look it's in
[52:46] the same context here I know God hides
[52:48] verses I I know I just preached on that
[52:49] too but in the context here Jerusalem is
[52:52] a joy Israel is not having Joy right now
[52:54] they're in war with Hamas they're
[52:56] getting attacked from the north right
[52:58] now from Iran they're not a joy this
[53:00] hasn't been fulfilled amen they's crying

[53:25] couple there by God's
[53:28] grace let me

[53:35] war on the earth during the
[53:37] Millennium Isaiah 65 let me just get 20
[53:41] says there are sinners though yes yeah
[53:45] that's right that's right okay now I

[54:06] amen right it's a very small uh minority
[54:09] that's actually built houses the Bible
