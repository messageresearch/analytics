[28:54] God's grace okay verse 6 Lord willing

[29:29] a good place to start

[29:51] I'll read 567 then we'll already ate
[29:54] together just to give you a chance to
[29:55] read there I'll read verse 5 6 7 let
[29:58] this mind be in you which was also in
[30:00] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[30:03] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[30:05] with God but made himself of no
[30:08] reputation and took upon him the form of
[30:11] a servant and was made in the likeness
[30:13] of men let's read verse 8 together one
[30:16] two three and being found in fashion as
[30:19] a man he humbled himself and became
[30:22] obedient unto death even the death of
[30:26] the cross praise God let's have one more
[30:28] word of Prayer never need on your heart
[30:29] let's just make it known unto the Lord
[30:31] here raising our hands or raising our
[30:33] hearts have any father we love you

[30:42] you realize you're here Lord God we

[30:49] here of your God to set forth Lord to to
[30:52] administer to those who are the children
[30:54] of God so Lord we're grateful for that
[30:56] God may we get in tune with your Holy
[30:58] Spirit with the lowliness of mind we may
[31:01] receive our portion of your anointing
[31:03] for this service and will bless your

[31:07] sacrifices that have been made Lord God
[31:09] and father we love your presence bless
[31:11] us now in Jesus name every said Amen god
[31:14] bless yous being seated praise God you
[31:22] [Music]
[31:25] can switch over here hon I got some
[31:27] slides here again for tonight it's like
[31:34] to continue this morning night when I
[31:36] try to do between every service on
[31:37] Sundays like I try to study both or two
[31:40] different subjects so I was trying to
[31:41] study the Statue perform and study this
[31:44] I just kind of felt led to go this way
[31:46] hopefully it'll be a blessing to you I'm
[31:48] sure will by the grace of the Lord but
[31:51] let's look continue on this thought of
[31:53] this this is such a beautiful chapter
[31:56] dealing with Christ
[31:58] dear how Christ Christ is our model on
[32:02] how to come into a unity of the faith
[32:06] right Paul we looked at this morning
[32:08] Paul wants us of one mind of one Accord
[32:11] all thinking the same thing he knows if
[32:16] they're born again of the Holy Ghost
[32:18] they're sealed in their souls but that's
[32:20] once it's sealed the battles not there
[32:22] anymore
[32:23] the battles now in the mind praise God
[32:24] and so his desire is to see every
[32:28] Christian come into a unity of like
[32:31] mindedness he calls it like mindedness
[32:34] so we we should all be even tonight we
[32:37] should all be thinking about the same
[32:38] thing praise God
[32:39] I'll be thinking about Jesus Christ amen
[32:42] now we read 6 we read five through eight
[32:45] but in 6 through 8 up here I just gave
[32:47] my little thoughts you know he gives us
[32:49] two subjects so look at we'll probably
[32:51] start with the Godhead Lord willing and
[32:52] then we will move here to servanthood
[32:55] and Paul's thoughts on this it's a real
[33:01] great thought here so verse 6 now for
[33:07] those of you who real familiar with the
[33:09] message this is brother Rams text for
[33:11] the unveiling of God he preached it
[33:13] twice once in Jeffersonville and once
[33:15] elsewhere I can't remember exactly where
[33:17] that one was preached but he preaches
[33:19] the unveiling of goddess into it
[33:21] yesterday or most of it not all of it
[33:24] so if you know the the text it's a
[33:27] beautiful text brother Branham shows how
[33:29] God is veiled in every generation God is
[33:33] invisible no man had ever see him so he
[33:37] had to come into a form just to be seen
[33:39] but no matter what form he's in he's
[33:43] always veiled brother BAM says he was
[33:47] veiled in the prophets he veil himself
[33:50] in Jesus Christ and that was the god
[33:52] veil we'd say praise God the perfect
[33:54] veil but boom he emphasizes that he says
[33:58] now you're the veil of God praise God
[34:02] now you hide God's presence amen
[34:05] he said then that's one of the major
[34:07] points of his sermon is to show that you
[34:10] and I now become the veil
[34:12] of Jesus Christ oh what a privilege
[34:14] praise God but it's just like the Old
[34:16] Testament he's hiding behind badger
[34:18] skins right he's hiding behind a very
[34:21] humble outward a texture writer outward
[34:26] appearance so humble but yet God Himself
[34:30] is hiding behind that praise God
[34:33] another great emphasis brother branham
[34:35] makes is the veil he focuses on the veil
[34:40] he said the veil of Jesus Jesus's veil
[34:43] was his flesh right the flesh was the
[34:45] veil of God but then he gets into the
[34:47] part where each age should go behind the
[34:51] veil and he brings it down to this day
[34:53] he said today there's a Methodist veil
[34:55] there's a Baptist male right there's a
[34:58] Pentecostal veil but he said believers
[35:00] have to break beyond the veil and get
[35:03] into the presence of God praise God amen
[35:06] and so that's another main thought that
[35:09] he brings out that we have to break
[35:11] through the veil praise God
[35:13] of denominationalism into the Friends of
[35:17] God now here form form is the word
[35:21] brother Graham emphasizes and if you
[35:23] have a Scofield Bible Scofield
[35:26] quotes a man named Thayer I don't know
[35:29] who there is actually didn't look that
[35:31] one up but the word form Thayer says is
[35:36] an morphing now in my lexicon I don't
[35:41] know what lexicon Thayer was using but
[35:44] there's no end before it I don't know if
[35:45] it makes a difference and just it's more
[35:47] fake more fake so in the word for means
[35:52] more fate it's the form by which a
[35:54] person or thing strikes the vision the
[35:57] external appearance so Jesus was in the
[36:02] form of God Jesus was in the external
[36:07] appearance of God praise God because God
[36:11] is invisible and this is the whole this
[36:15] is outside this this is the whole
[36:17] revelation of the Godhead if you can
[36:19] catch and I love it God sends a prophet
[36:22] tells him thus saith the LORD
[36:23] trinitarianism run but he's got to give
[36:26] us
[36:26] something to point to and he points us
[36:27] right here to Philippians to praise God
[36:29] he's got to give us some benefits if
[36:32] it's not truly what is it it's the form
[36:34] God in three forms amen God in three
[36:38] manifestations praise God and he points
[36:41] us of all the scripture he points us to
[36:43] Philippians chapter 2 praise God he said
[36:46] Christ was in the form of God he was in
[36:50] the morphe he was in the external
[36:52] appearance or the mask of God amen
[36:56] I just want to read you some quotes so
[36:58] you can have kind of the context of it
[36:59] God changed himself changed his form if
[37:02] you notice here in Philippians he said
[37:04] thinking they're not thinking at robbery
[37:06] but took the form of a man now the Greek
[37:09] word there for that form I've been
[37:10] looking at it all day yesterday trying
[37:12] to think out what it was I find I come
[37:15] with this word of and more faith now see
[37:18] that's Scofield and I added that that's
[37:20] Scofield reference but in the Greek
[37:22] there's no en which I don't know that
[37:24] makes a difference it smelled in then
[37:26] the spells it looking in the Greek to
[37:28] find out what a morph a was I may
[37:29] pronounce that wrong but reason I
[37:31] spelled it is the taste is released the
[37:34] people will scholars well you know what
[37:36] I mean by he said he when the morph a
[37:39] that means he changed himself he come
[37:41] down the Greek word there means
[37:42] something that could not be seen yet
[37:44] it's there and then it's changed and the
[37:47] eye catches it see like Elijah Dothan
[37:50] the servant couldn't see all those
[37:51] angels around there and God just changed
[37:54] he brought the Angels down but he
[37:56] changed the seeing of the servant and
[37:58] there was the mountains full of angels
[38:00] and fire horses a fire and chariots of
[38:04] fire all around his prophet see they he
[38:06] changed the seeing the thing is already
[38:09] there
[38:10] praise God so God is already here praise
[38:13] God amen but he's hiding behind veils
[38:16] amen he's a more faint right he's he's
[38:20] hiding behind a veil he has a form in
[38:23] this case is we believe which were real
[38:26] Bible believers he's behind the form of
[38:29] the preaching of the word tonight now he
[38:31] might be in the form of a gift in you
[38:33] but he he certainly isn't behind the
[38:35] form of me praise God because it's my
[38:38] it's my lot to pray
[38:40] next weekend it's not but it's my lot to
[38:42] preach so God takes the form of the veil
[38:45] and he's hiding behind that speaking his
[38:48] word to his children tonight hey man
[38:51] hallelujah that's God's grace to us
[38:55] he's already here but he he changes his
[38:57] form so what I'm trying to say God has
[39:00] always was is here the only thing he
[39:04] done we become a man he changes masks
[39:06] and morph a changes its mass to what he
[39:09] was what he is or his mask another act
[39:12] like in a great drama I was speaking
[39:14] this morning kind of catching up on the
[39:16] Shakespeare it's been a long time when
[39:18] Shakespeare wrote the drama for King
[39:20] James of England when he character of
[39:22] Macbeth see Shakespeare did not believe
[39:25] in witches but in the play for the King
[39:27] did believe in witches so he had to
[39:28] include witches and now in order to do
[39:30] this they changed the cast Becky here
[39:32] and Carmen they acted that in the school
[39:35] where she just graduated a few weeks ago
[39:37] now maybe one person play three or four
[39:40] parts in order to do that he changes
[39:42] Mass sometimes he comes out he's this
[39:44] character and next time he comes out
[39:46] he's another character but this is the
[39:48] same person all the time and that's God
[39:51] he changed himself from a pillar of fire
[39:53] become a man then change himself from
[39:56] that back in the spirit again that he
[39:57] might dwell in man God acting a man what
[40:00] he really was Jesus Christ was God
[40:02] acting in a man in a man in a man that's
[40:05] what he was he changed from the pillar
[40:07] fire and had come in which was a veil in
[40:10] the wilderness and that hid God from
[40:12] Israel Moses seen the shape of his body
[40:15] but really he was hid all the time
[40:18] behind the pillar of fire which was the
[40:20] logos that went out from God hallelujah
[40:24] now okay I thought I got one more - got
[40:26] one more yeah one more now we find out
[40:29] here since Pentecost God is not acting
[40:31] and he said now he's acting through man
[40:34] oh what a privilege amen oh no it's so
[40:36] humble let's try to see God tonight I
[40:39] know it's so hum I know I know it's hard
[40:41] and it's difficult for us at times but
[40:43] let's see try to see the Word of God
[40:45] that God wants to speak to us tonight
[40:47] praise God because since Pentecost it's
[40:50] God hiding in men and women bracelet
[40:53] and we were gathered together like this
[40:55] it's behind up man preaching the word he
[40:58] was acting in a man then Jesus now he's
[41:00] acting through man that has chosen for
[41:02] this purpose God in the form of man he
[41:04] changed himself he said from the form of
[41:07] God to a form of a man I knew you now
[41:11] let me go back and I'm gonna rehearse
[41:13] this real quick I kind of got this other
[41:15] one ready I just want to go back to this
[41:19] it's been a years and years since I
[41:20] preaches this but four or five years now
[41:23] let's go back to theophany of God just I
[41:25] wanted to briefly go through he said
[41:27] take a little trip with me this is from
[41:28] 53 before there ever was a star moon he
[41:32] said there was a time there wasn't
[41:33] nothing it was all forever and eternity
[41:35] let's go out here on the edge of the
[41:37] Bannister look over and see these things
[41:38] happen he said now no man has seen the
[41:41] father at any time no man can see God in
[41:43] bodily form because God is in a body
[41:45] form God's a spirit no man has seen the
[41:48] father only the begotten of the father
[41:50] declared him so he quotes John 1:18 now
[41:57] he said there's no light no dark no
[41:59] nothing it seems nothing but in there is
[42:01] a great supernatural being Jehovah God
[42:03] who covered all space of all places at
[42:05] all times he was from everlasting from
[42:08] everlasting the beginning of the
[42:09] creation that's God see you can't see
[42:11] nothing can't hear nothing can't move an
[42:13] atom in the air not nothing yet God was
[42:16] not yet God was there that was God no
[42:20] man has seen that now that's the father
[42:22] that's God the Father so before even the
[42:26] first day of creation before time and
[42:28] days and what could be seen in the human
[42:31] dimension so before any creation there
[42:34] was just God amen and then after a while
[42:36] I begin to see a little sacred line I
[42:38] like that little sacred light begin to
[42:42] form like a little halo or something you
[42:44] can only see it by the spiritual eyes to
[42:46] look now while we're looking so you'd
[42:48] have to have a vision to be able to see
[42:50] it praise God because it wasn't a
[42:52] natural in this natural realm like a
[42:54] light we see outside right now but it
[42:56] was in a spiritual dimension probably
[42:58] the seventh dimension right he said
[43:01] we're standing on the great big
[43:02] Bannister watching what God doing we'll
[43:04] get right down to this question here and
[43:05] you'll see how he
[43:06] brings it so before day one Genesis one
[43:10] you have this is that weeds call this
[43:13] the logos right and then scripturally
[43:18] this is what made everything this this
[43:21] pillar of fire made everything so you
[43:24] can't have light time or days without
[43:27] first having the Sun because the Bible
[43:29] said that all the Sun created all things
[43:32] praise God so out of the invisible came
[43:35] a visible light and that visible light
[43:38] spoke and created amen all things were
[43:43] created by him and for him speaking of
[43:46] Christ so this is the Christ this is the
[43:48] anointing the next thing we've been
[43:50] going to see my eyes of supernatural
[43:52] looking we see a little white light
[43:54] forming out there that was called by the
[43:56] Bible readers of logos the anointing the
[43:59] part of God begin to develop into
[44:01] something so human beings could have
[44:03] some type of type of idea what he was a
[44:06] little like moving that was the Word of
[44:09] God so the first thing God tried to get
[44:12] us to try to show us what he was was
[44:15] light amen
[44:17] light and we have to have light to have
[44:19] life praise God and so God could choose
[44:22] anything you would choose light to
[44:24] represent himself amen and that's how in
[44:27] the first veil that he chose the first
[44:30] master hidebehind was liked amen
[44:33] hallelujah
[44:34] so these are all the same thing when we
[44:37] say the logos or the word or the
[44:40] anointing or the theophany of God the
[44:42] Son of God a bit or a visible form of
[44:45] the Holy Spirit it's all the same thing
[44:47] it's all the logos it's all the Son of
[44:50] God it's all the Holy Spirit praise God
[44:53] in a visible form amen
[44:56] so this is a morphing this is God and
[44:58] morph a hallelujah now here where it
[45:04] gets down to the real deep part here
[45:06] yeah okay now God gave himself birth to
[45:14] this son
[45:16] so a Sun coming out of a father right
[45:18] which was before there was even an atom
[45:21] or or air to make an atom see Jesus and
[45:24] glorify me father with the glory that we
[45:27] had before the foundation of the world
[45:31] praise God so this is to me right here
[45:34] is the mystery the relationship between
[45:36] the father and the son that's the
[45:38] mystery of the Godhead I have more
[45:40] respect for people that believe in two
[45:42] persons than 3 because 3 is totally 3
[45:46] then the father the holy ghosts are
[45:47] separate people Jesus has two fathers
[45:49] but I have a lot more respect for the
[45:51] Tunis people now that's just a small
[45:53] group I've only met one one time that
[45:55] believe in two persons I think John
[45:57] Graham and I had a meeting with him one
[45:58] time he believed in two persons but
[46:01] that's closer than three praise God see
[46:04] Jesus says father glorify thou me with
[46:06] thine own self with the glory which I
[46:08] had with thee before the world was so
[46:13] this light the light that came out of
[46:16] God was the son praise God and God was
[46:20] in the Sun and Jesus can reference back
[46:24] that walk that's amazing oh he's on
[46:26] earth he can reference that he said
[46:28] glorify me with the glory we had we
[46:31] shared before the foundation of the
[46:32] world now that's the mystery right there
[46:34] if anybody can explain that their God
[46:37] right cuz you and I can't explain that
[46:40] and then he says father I will that they
[46:43] also whom thou has given me be with me
[46:45] where I am that they may behold my glory
[46:48] which thou hast given me for thou lovest
[46:50] me before the foundation of the world so
[46:55] the invisible God looked at that light
[46:58] and he loved that light Oh hallelujah
[47:02] praise God amen I don't believe the
[47:06] Bible praise God and to me this is the
[47:09] deepest part of the Godhead right here
[47:10] this is the part that no man can explain
[47:13] Mamre said the glory that we shared
[47:17] yea with thee and there's other
[47:19] scriptures that say we we and us they
[47:23] actually use the pronoun there looks
[47:25] like too but it's not to people it's to
[47:28] forms
[47:29] praise God or we say an invisible and
[47:32] then a visible form its form it's a
[47:35] morphate praise God
[47:38] now first John I'm sorry John 1 in the
[47:42] beginning was the word the words with
[47:43] God the Word was God who's made flesh
[47:45] and dwelt among us God unfolding himself
[47:47] down to human being now watch how he did
[47:51] it
[47:52] ok now verse 3 John 1:3
[47:54] all things were made by him and without
[47:57] him was not anything made that was made
[48:01] okay so everything was made by the word
[48:04] right by the logos now we know the
[48:09] scripture says the first words recorded
[48:10] or let there be light right now I
[48:14] believe those are the first words where
[48:16] when brother Brooks was here he said the
[48:17] first word was Jesus well it might be I
[48:19] don't know but the first words recorded
[48:20] in the Bible are let there be light
[48:22] right those are the first words of God
[48:25] so it was a voice coming out of the
[48:28] invisible saying let there be light in
[48:30] other words I want my future children to
[48:34] to see Who I am
[48:36] amen I want to become tangible I want my
[48:40] I want my children to be able to see Who
[48:42] I am
[48:43] I want to be I want to love my children
[48:46] and I want them to love me amen
[48:48] so he starts working his way towards
[48:51] flesh in Jesus Amen but he starts with
[48:55] light he wants to be known he wants to
[48:58] be felt he wants to be loved he wants to
[49:00] be worshipped and that's what we're
[49:02] doing tonight praise God amen that's
[49:04] what he was he was condescending himself
[49:07] down changing his form bringing himself
[49:10] down but he hear the word is the logos
[49:13] it speaks the word I'm sorry the
[49:16] misérable speaks the word that's the
[49:18] logos that came out from God God's first
[49:22] form and that beautiful Christ is God's
[49:25] first form he said or the Bible says
[49:27] Jesus is the beginning of the creation
[49:30] of God amen
[49:32] it's a dual purpose it's the creation
[49:34] here of light but it's also the creation
[49:37] of a sinless body amen
[49:39] both were creations right the light was
[49:42] the crash
[49:43] the beginning let there be light and
[49:45] then Jesus's body in the womb of Mary
[49:47] that was also the beginning of the
[49:49] creation of God it was a new race praise
[49:52] God there's a new group of humans praise
[49:54] God that starting with Jesus there would
[49:57] be a group of humans that have no sin in
[49:59] their bodies and their spirits and their
[50:02] souls Jesus was the first but we will be
[50:05] the rest praise God that's right
[50:08] the beginning of the creation of God oh
[50:11] I'm looking forward to it aren't you to
[50:13] have a body where there's no sin in it
[50:15] at all praise God
[50:16] where death is swallowed up in life amen
[50:21] now I'm gonna stop there go back the
[50:23] other one okay that's a little review
[50:28] now I do that because I got a lot of
[50:29] kids here let me count real quick one
[50:30] two three well I got 12 kids here you've
[50:35] all dots have heard it over and over
[50:36] again but they haven't
[50:37] so let's bear with them praise God so
[50:40] they can understand because one day
[50:42] they're gonna have those questions what
[50:43] does that mean daddy what's the low cost
[50:45] mean what is that what was the beginning
[50:46] of the creation of God what does that
[50:47] mean and so the sooner we introduce it
[50:50] humming bleah that's better
[50:51] oh yeah because we we were pointed back
[50:55] to the Bible program point us back to
[50:58] the scripture he point us back to the
[51:00] word for to understand God God just
[51:03] changes his form he changes his mask and
[51:06] that's how we receive it praise God now
[51:11] now I'm gonna hold off on this just for
[51:14] a moment let me go over this I want to
[51:16] make sure I never have to put 1/2 you
[51:18] have to put slides on this but let me
[51:21] just read through this I got some notes
[51:22] nor willing in the upcoming book Church
[51:28] how many realize that we're not actually
[51:30] official oneness of God how many
[51:32] understand that there's a whole
[51:34] denomination called oneness and church
[51:36] they've done the same thing the
[51:37] Pentecostals that they've denominated
[51:39] around Crees now it's sad to say they've
[51:43] done the same thing they they caught a
[51:45] revelation Oh God's out three persons
[51:47] but then they went and just in the last
[51:49] we'd say 30 or 40 years I have to look
[51:51] it up you can look it up on the U P CI
[51:53] website United Pentecost was
[51:55] incorporated
[51:56] their oneness and they've written up
[51:58] just in the last Emagine they had a
[52:01] little revival they caught some of this
[52:03] endtime revival but they went and
[52:06] denominated on it and now they've got a
[52:08] denomination oh god help us not the
[52:10] denominator is God God help us to put a
[52:12] comma after everything we believe praise
[52:14] God
[52:15] but they caught the idea that God is not
[52:18] three people or two he's one but they
[52:22] went and organized around it now when
[52:27] you talk with people and I've talked
[52:29] with just a few different ministers
[52:31] about this they're gonna ask you are you
[52:33] oneness and you would say well we would
[52:37] say like brother Branson they ask
[52:38] brother Branham are you Calvin or
[52:40] Armenian right what one believes what
[52:44] one believes it's all grace other one
[52:46] believes it's all works and what Madison
[52:48] I'm with Calvin as long as Calvin stays
[52:51] in the Bible he said I'm Armenian as
[52:54] long as Armenians stay in the Bible
[52:56] praise God so our answer is well I'm
[52:59] oneness as long as they stay in the
[53:00] Bible praise God so if you and they and
[53:04] people ask me I always say that well I
[53:06] believe God's one but I don't agree with
[53:08] all the oneness doctrine all the oneness
[53:11] organization Deborah I understand now
[53:14] the common word Trinitarians
[53:16] will call us if they don't call us
[53:19] oneness they'll call us motorists a
[53:21] motorist that's what they call us now
[53:26] and do I consider myself a motorist
[53:29] no because if you look up motorless they
[53:31] have a certain definition in the
[53:33] dictionaries of them and it doesn't line
[53:35] up with the scripture I'm gonna give you
[53:37] some examples but modalism is closer
[53:40] than try theism right so modalism
[53:47] oneness they're all words but we we
[53:50] never we never we never label ourselves
[53:52] by a term
[53:54] we're just Holy Ghost field Bible
[53:56] believing Christians and my Creed is the
[54:00] Word of God my Creed is Christ amen
[54:04] hallelujah so see we never want to
[54:07] organize and
[54:10] clampdown in and a limit god
[54:14] right the scripture says Israel turn
[54:16] their backs on God and they limited the
[54:19] Holy One of Israel that's why I Church I
[54:23] don't want to that's why I don't want to
[54:25] get in this this thing of we only need
[54:27] two takes you only need the taste only
[54:29] what if God would want to give us a
[54:31] revelation from a book brother Ram never
[54:33] preached on them because there's
[54:35] numerous Bible books but I've never
[54:36] preached I'll what if there's a
[54:38] scripture in the Bible that pertains to
[54:41] the bride but brother Branham never
[54:42] mentioned it is it possible God could
[54:45] anoint us to see that scripture and
[54:47] benefit from it and then it would help
[54:49] us in our lives
[54:50] is it possible yes amen I believe that
[54:53] if it's in the Word of God if it's in
[54:57] here
[54:57] now what it will do but Adam says in the
[54:59] church age book it'll just give us more
[55:01] information it won't change the original
[55:03] revelation you know aligned with and it
[55:06] all it'll be harmonious with the
[55:08] original revelation God gave us through
[55:11] brother Brendan it won't take away from
[55:13] water baptism or the Godhead or serpent
[55:15] seed or the church ages or the seven
[55:17] seals it won't take away from that we
[55:19] don't add more understanding to that
[55:22] praise God
[55:25] thank the Lord so modalism is the doctor
[55:29] that the persons of the Trinity
[55:31] represent only three modes or aspects of
[55:34] the divine revelation and not co-equal a
[55:38] coexisting persons now that's true
[55:42] so the I'm sorry that definition I use
[55:44] that from the dictionary a dictionary
[55:48] out for my app computer so I sight it on
[55:50] there so that definition is actually
[55:52] right God is just changing his mode or
[55:56] his appearance right he's changing his
[55:58] form amen
[56:00] now what they do though modalism
[56:04] sometimes breaks down in two ways
[56:07] because the father and the Holy Spirit
[56:10] are identical but the father and the son
[56:12] were not always identical okay
[56:16] the father and son share identical
[56:19] nature but God is his word and his word
[56:22] became flesh in Christ
[56:24] but their substance was different when
[56:26] Jesus was a man okay because the father
[56:32] substance is invisible but the and
[56:35] Eternal Spirit is invisible but Jesus
[56:38] had a human substance praise God
[56:42] okay so that's where it breaks down
[56:44] because the modalism will say all three
[56:48] of them are identical well not exactly
[56:51] see they'll say the Father Son Holy
[56:53] Ghost are all mortal some says they're
[56:55] all three identical but the son said I
[56:58] can do nothing but what the father shows
[57:00] me and Jesus said the father is greater
[57:03] than I don't believe that so see even
[57:08] modalism when they start that's what
[57:10] happens when they start making their
[57:11] Creed's they start limiting the word of
[57:14] God okay and now see with modalism each
[57:20] form had a different name but see with
[57:24] us we know there's only one name to the
[57:27] Father Son Holy Ghost
[57:28] that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank
[57:32] the Lord
[57:33] so that's a second way so the moralism
[57:35] says see each form has a different name
[57:37] but we know their titles father's a
[57:40] titles sons a title Holy Spirit is the
[57:43] title praise God but the name the power
[57:45] of the name is the name Jesus how many
[57:48] feel that power tonight praise God you
[57:50] just you just say let's all say the name
[57:52] Jesus ready Jesus let's say little
[57:54] louder Jesus let's wake ourself up let's
[57:57] say louder ready
[57:58] Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus
[58:01] amen
[58:02] there's no power in son I'm a son but
[58:06] there's power in the name of Jesus
[58:08] Church just breathe his name I start
[58:10] feeling good already crazy huh Jesus
[58:13] just start saying his name with faith in
[58:15] his name Peter said it's his name
[58:17] through faith in his name has made this
[58:20] man strong it's his name through faith
[58:23] in his name that makes us strong today
[58:26] just speak in his name Jesus so modalism
[58:30] says they're all equal wrong the son's
[58:33] body wasn't equal to the father they all
[58:37] have
[58:37] three separate names that's wrong they
[58:40] all one name and the third way it says
[58:43] listen can you believe this
[58:45] the modal ISM believes the father
[58:47] suffered along with Christ on the cross
[58:52] because they say he was actually present
[58:56] in and personally identified with the
[58:58] son a church the father can't suffer
[59:01] physically because he don't have flesh
[59:02] and bones he's the spirit right and so
[59:07] see this is another way modalism fails
[59:11] remember the father for sup Jesus Jesus
[59:15] said my God my God why is thou forsaken
[59:18] me so see Jesus had to become cursed
[59:22] right so that we could be blessed and so
[59:26] now I don't know how this is possible
[59:27] Church I don't know but God must have a
[59:30] remove his holy spear out of Jesus's
[59:33] soul I don't have even sure if that's
[59:34] possible so I'm just presuming right
[59:36] here right but somehow because how could
[59:39] how could God curse a Holy Ghost filled
[59:41] salt debris with me I know it's kind of
[59:43] deep out there buddy
[59:44] everybody okay tonight so Jesus has a
[59:47] body spirit soul his soul is born again
[59:50] how does God take that anointing off the
[59:53] soul I don't know but we know God cannot
[59:56] curse himself praise God
[59:59] but he could curse a body praise God
[1:00:02] he couldn't curse a body so he he
[1:00:06] created this body he some event says he
[1:00:09] probably took it off in the Garden of
[1:00:10] Gethsemane the anointing he took the
[1:00:12] anointing off so the curse could come
[1:00:14] upon him and then he cursed that body of
[1:00:19] Jesus the Bible said he was made a curse
[1:00:23] for us and God hath made him to be sin
[1:00:27] God is not sin God does not sin but
[1:00:30] Jesus body became sin for us amen okay
[1:00:37] so that's the three areas where modalism
[1:00:40] fails so I think that's a help to you is
[1:00:44] that help to you by God's grace see
[1:00:46] we're not of the oneness denomination
[1:00:48] nor do we say well we're modeless but
[1:00:50] what I've said is that don't be
[1:00:51] well modalism is the closest thing to us
[1:00:53] but whenever you start defining it
[1:00:56] whenever you start organized wherever
[1:00:58] organization is there's death as soon as
[1:01:02] a group organizes they die amen
[1:01:05] as soon as they say we got to all figure
[1:01:07] it out and God's not going to reveal
[1:01:09] anymore
[1:01:10] in other words as soon as you get
[1:01:11] complacent we start dying if you get
[1:01:15] complacent abusive and say like this if
[1:01:17] you don't keep search searching either
[1:01:19] we'll get complacent and you can
[1:01:21] backslide we have to keep seeking after
[1:01:24] more of God growing in grace growing in
[1:01:26] knowledge praise God amen see everybody
[1:01:29] and you know this church anybody can
[1:01:32] become their own denomination because we
[1:01:36] know some right we we've had friends and
[1:01:40] family people when they get their own
[1:01:42] idea they won't take anything else and
[1:01:45] now they've become the denomination of
[1:01:47] brother you may even put a name there
[1:01:50] they won't take the pastor's word
[1:01:52] anymore they won't be corrected by
[1:01:54] anybody they are their own denomination
[1:01:57] they've limit this cut off any floor
[1:02:00] revelation or any corruption they cut
[1:02:03] God they cut down off and they're
[1:02:05] organized and their spiritual lives die
[1:02:08] and they wonder why they're not on fire
[1:02:10] for God's because they've denominated
[1:02:12] they've limited the Spirit of God
[1:02:14] they're not hungry and thirsty for
[1:02:16] righteousness oh god help us to stay
[1:02:18] hungry and thirsty oh it's so true
[1:02:21] church oh my mmm
[1:02:27] there's five million oneness believers
[1:02:30] worldwide five million I wonder how many
[1:02:36] message people there that's just that's
[1:02:38] interesting number five million but
[1:02:42] there's almost 8 billion people on the
[1:02:44] earth 5 million our oneness
[1:02:48] oh my well no wonder Jesus said few
[1:02:51] there be that find it right few there be
[1:02:54] that find it no no let's get now I just
[1:02:58] want to lay that in there that's
[1:03:00] especially for the children I hope it
[1:03:02] helps the adults as well by the grace of
[1:03:04] the Lord
[1:03:07] so let this mind be in you now the mine
[1:03:10] part is is mainly in verse seven right
[1:03:15] but let's read verse six now here's
[1:03:19] where I just heard I think one or two
[1:03:20] preachers stumble on this they try to
[1:03:23] make us equal with God well we are in
[1:03:25] one way but we are not in another way
[1:03:29] because look at the word equal now look
[1:03:32] and see or that's important work Jesus
[1:03:35] only is fully equal with God only
[1:03:39] because now he's got a perfect body
[1:03:41] right body soul spirit and all power is
[1:03:45] given unto me in heaven earth praise God
[1:03:48] but see equal means equal in quantity or
[1:03:52] quality okay so we would say as
[1:03:59] Christians if we have a portion of the
[1:04:01] Holy Spirit like program says if that's
[1:04:04] a portion a spoonful of eternal life it
[1:04:07] has the same quality of eternal life as
[1:04:09] a whole ocean of water right it's the
[1:04:13] same thing but it's not the same
[1:04:15] quantity but it's the same quality
[1:04:21] praise God now here's a few quotes I
[1:04:27] wanted to read just to give you an idea
[1:04:29] this is Corinthians this is where bo-ram
[1:04:31] says he's not equal with God no brother
[1:04:34] what God does is perfect we ain't got no
[1:04:36] business with our minds putting anything
[1:04:38] to it just leave it the way it is God
[1:04:39] did it God said that sells it just take
[1:04:41] it or don't know how if I could explain
[1:04:44] it then I'd be equal with God I can't
[1:04:47] explain it I just believe it that's all
[1:04:50] that's all master dude see if we could
[1:04:55] explain every single thing he said we'd
[1:04:57] be equal with God but the fact we can't
[1:05:00] shows we're not equal with God
[1:05:02] here's where he says Satan's not equal
[1:05:04] with God the devil is not a creator the
[1:05:07] devil perverts what has been created but
[1:05:09] he's not a traitor if he was he'd be
[1:05:11] equal with God he would make himself a
[1:05:14] world but God is the only crater and the
[1:05:16] devil perverts what God has gree
[1:05:20] here's another one here now this is what
[1:05:22] I survived I was mentioned earlier the
[1:05:24] very first expectation was you become
[1:05:26] the absolute II was tempted and she
[1:05:28] wanted to become the absolute she wanted
[1:05:30] to be just like God and that's what
[1:05:32] jeffersonville's doing they're making
[1:05:33] brother Bram the absolute so to me in my
[1:05:36] opinion they're falling to the first lie
[1:05:38] the same lie Satan told Eve is the same
[1:05:41] lie these tape worshipers are falling to
[1:05:43] right now it's because it's a no changes
[1:05:46] tricks right now the fourth verse I read
[1:05:50] Genesis 3 4 and then 4 and 5 we know
[1:05:54] that you should not surely die see he's
[1:05:56] giving her a reason will you like to be
[1:05:58] equal with God in other words you really
[1:06:01] want to be right with God take my advice
[1:06:03] listen me God don't mean that
[1:06:05] he just didn't and like let me try that
[1:06:09] in now
[1:06:09] the people that become their own
[1:06:11] denomination I said earlier may become
[1:06:13] their own absolute right they won't take
[1:06:16] anybody's correction they won't hear any
[1:06:18] other thoughts outside their own they
[1:06:20] can only believe it the way they want to
[1:06:22] believe it because now they say they're
[1:06:24] equal with God that's why God will cast
[1:06:27] them down Satan said I will exalt my
[1:06:29] throne up I will be like the Most High I
[1:06:31] will be the absolute and God said
[1:06:33] because that you'll be brought down to
[1:06:35] the pits of hell that's right so we saw
[1:06:40] Eve and Satan are not equals right and
[1:06:44] their brother Ram wasn't equal with God
[1:06:48] so let's not get that thought in our
[1:06:50] mind here as far as like we are equal
[1:06:53] with God to the full degree as Jesus
[1:06:56] we're not now before I get to verse 9
[1:07:02] though I'm gonna read verse 7 so here's
[1:07:08] how honey what the mind of Christ here's
[1:07:10] how we get it let this mind be in you he
[1:07:13] was in the form of God he thought it not
[1:07:15] robbery to be equal with God verse 7 but
[1:07:18] he made himself of no reputation and
[1:07:20] took upon him the form of a servant this
[1:07:25] is where the people that have heard two
[1:07:27] preachers get off on this I'm equal with
[1:07:29] God or work brides equal with God well
[1:07:32] this is what they don't
[1:07:33] they don't keep reading and see that if
[1:07:35] you got this if you got this mind you
[1:07:37] become a servant to other people you
[1:07:38] don't become the master you become the
[1:07:40] servant Jesus then the exalt himself
[1:07:44] right he let God exalt him verse seven
[1:07:48] but he made himself of no reputation and
[1:07:51] took upon in the form of a servant and
[1:07:53] was made in the likeness of men and
[1:07:58] that's the same greek word and more
[1:08:00] faith so Jesus was in the external
[1:08:05] appearance of God and he took himself
[1:08:07] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:08:10] or took upon the mask of a servant and
[1:08:13] was made in the likeness of men
[1:08:16] his body was the mask praise God
[1:08:20] verse 8 now here it is for us to and
[1:08:22] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:08:25] humbled himself yet he had the access to
[1:08:30] the fullness of the word humbled himself
[1:08:33] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:08:37] death of the Cross so someone will who
[1:08:43] has access to all power all anointing
[1:08:48] his he was limitless right his potential
[1:08:51] was limitless because all of the power
[1:08:53] of God could be behind him but we
[1:08:57] learned Paul saying learn from him
[1:08:59] although you have all of this power you
[1:09:01] have all this word and you have all this
[1:09:03] ability you have the name of Jesus he
[1:09:05] said humble yourself unto self death
[1:09:09] writes of crucifixion dying out to your
[1:09:13] will humble yourself just as Jesus had
[1:09:16] he had this equality he had the
[1:09:18] quantitative humble himself take upon
[1:09:22] the mine of becoming humble and Jesus
[1:09:25] said I do nothing except the father
[1:09:28] shows me first
[1:09:29] thanks God
[1:09:35] I think that's beautiful don't you so
[1:09:39] the mind of a person the mind of Christ
[1:09:41] who was equal with God the only one who
[1:09:44] was fully equal with God his thinking
[1:09:48] was I need to humble myself become a
[1:09:51] servant and I need to take up my cross
[1:09:55] right and die but we take up our cross
[1:09:58] daily and follow him church every day
[1:10:06] right should feel like something is
[1:10:08] dying right we've got that something has
[1:10:10] to die every day of our lives right it
[1:10:15] has to if it's not then we're not
[1:10:17] bearing a cross if life is just all fun
[1:10:19] and all games and going after every
[1:10:21] pleasure every place then there's no
[1:10:23] death there's got to be a death if we
[1:10:25] have the mind of Christ we must humble
[1:10:27] ourselves and accept the death of taking
[1:10:29] up the cross of Jesus every day if you
[1:10:34] got your Bibles go to Psalms 12:6 I kind
[1:10:38] of ended with this one on Wednesday
[1:10:39] night but I want to go back over here
[1:10:54] Psalms 12:6 now copy you that fan on the
[1:11:03] hot air get all these bodies in here
[1:11:08] right pumping out all that heat thank
[1:11:13] you sir Psalms 12:6 wow look at David
[1:11:21] man look at verse 1 help Lord for the
[1:11:22] godly man Cephas in that about today
[1:11:25] Lord where are the godly people we see
[1:11:28] him on Wednesday and Sunday if your
[1:11:31] family right here you might see more
[1:11:33] often not let me around my family I love
[1:11:35] my brothers is my sister for the
[1:11:38] faithful fail from among the children of
[1:11:40] men my co so I see it shows in every age
[1:11:43] there's a small little remnant right now
[1:11:45] we're set to 6 is where we ended on
[1:11:47] Wednesday night speaking of the Statue
[1:11:48] program in the words of the Lord are
[1:11:50] pure words as silver tried in a furnace
[1:11:53] of Earth purified seven times now this
[1:11:57] is a little bit of a paradox scripture
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:00] God's Word doesn't need purified and the
[1:12:04] church said but David is giving an
[1:12:08] example the only thing I can compare
[1:12:10] God's Word to us would be silver that's
[1:12:13] already gone through seven fires right
[1:12:16] and it's in other words it's in the most
[1:12:18] complete pure state that's the only
[1:12:21] thing I can apply it to is the the
[1:12:24] purest thing is remember proverbs 35 and
[1:12:27] 6 says every word of God is pure a man
[1:12:32] but see I used I use the scripture to
[1:12:35] show the statue over man there's seven
[1:12:38] purifications amen a church you know you
[1:12:42] know when gold or silver is fired what
[1:12:44] do they do they got to take the dross
[1:12:46] out right the good silver and gold it
[1:12:49] comes up to the top and the dross goes
[1:12:51] down amen right so it's like our
[1:12:55] character our character we got to have
[1:12:57] that's why this seven Holy Ghost
[1:12:59] revivals amen
[1:13:00] seven hot fiery Bibles
[1:13:03] our God adds faith and virtue a
[1:13:05] knowledge to the fire of God purging and
[1:13:09] cleaning us out sanctum and that links
[1:13:12] us waiting for that great picture praise
[1:13:13] God it's a good reference for me each
[1:13:15] one is a fire and it burns away remember
[1:13:19] each one you got to reject you got to
[1:13:20] reject human reasoning and unbelief and
[1:13:24] hypocrisy and selfishness and this is
[1:13:27] what it's showing that that's how God
[1:13:29] fully purges that's how he fully
[1:13:32] sanctifies his people amen God's Word
[1:13:36] doesn't need reply but it's we're the
[1:13:38] ones that need refined praise God go to
[1:13:42] Malachi 3 this because these two
[1:13:44] scriptures tie together
[1:13:45] Malachi 3:1 see that's why God uses the
[1:13:51] 7 because 7 is the 7 steps and that's
[1:13:55] the completely pure believer after going
[1:13:59] through sanctification because they're
[1:14:01] seven virtues Malachi 3:1 we know the
[1:14:09] Word of God has already pure so David
[1:14:13] was saying the closest thing I could see
[1:14:14] would be silver that's purified seven
[1:14:17] times would be like the Word of God but
[1:14:20] the reason uses 7 is because there are
[1:14:22] seven golden candlesticks praise God
[1:14:24] there's 7 stars in the hand of Jesus 7
[1:14:26] is God's number of completion amen
[1:14:30] and silver is redemption so that's how
[1:14:33] we're fully redeemed through
[1:14:34] sanctification and then capped off with
[1:14:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Malachi
[1:14:42] 3:1 behold I will send my messenger and
[1:14:44] he shall prepare the way before me and
[1:14:46] the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly
[1:14:48] come to his temple even the messenger of
[1:14:50] the Covenant who need the leiden behold
[1:14:53] he shall come saith the Lord of Hosts
[1:14:55] but who may abide the day of his coming
[1:14:58] and who shall stand when he appeared for
[1:15:00] he is like a refiners fire and like a
[1:15:04] Fuller's soap and he shall sit as a
[1:15:07] refiner and a purifier of silver and he
[1:15:11] shall purify the sons of Levi and purge
[1:15:13] them as gold and silver that they may
[1:15:17] for unto the Lord and offering in
[1:15:19] righteousness amen
[1:15:21] she Church God is going to receive our
[1:15:23] offerings after we're purified praise
[1:15:25] God right that's not going to accept our
[1:15:28] offering if we got sin in our lives and
[1:15:30] we got dross and we're not confessing
[1:15:32] the way we ought to do we're not living
[1:15:34] a godly life we got to go through the
[1:15:36] fires of God amen
[1:15:38] we go through the fire burns away our
[1:15:40] dross that's what I'm trying to get you
[1:15:41] like every morning we got to pray and
[1:15:43] ask God to take the dross off us and
[1:15:45] then when we offer the sacrifice gallery
[1:15:48] say that praise God because it's from a
[1:15:50] pure heart a purified heart because he
[1:15:54] liked that amen
[1:15:56] thank the Lord so see seven times silver
[1:16:03] is purified each time dross is retracted
[1:16:08] from the silver and the silver solidify
[1:16:10] then it's got to be washed and purified
[1:16:12] another fiery anointing on it oh thank
[1:16:16] the Lord praise God thank God for his
[1:16:18] fiery anointing how many could say amen
[1:16:20] to that
[1:16:20] thank God those times where he comes
[1:16:23] around and he heats you up and he melts
[1:16:25] you it would ever be melted by the Lord
[1:16:26] and you feel like you're falling to
[1:16:29] pieces right here you feel like you're
[1:16:31] just dripping down he's that's what he's
[1:16:33] there to melt your desires away praise
[1:16:36] God amen to burn your desires away to
[1:16:41] apply heat to your life amen to apply
[1:16:43] pressure to your life until he burns
[1:16:45] away your selfishness or your hypocrisy
[1:16:47] or your unbelief the refining fires of
[1:16:50] God then then come to church and offer
[1:17:01] sacrifices once you're refining the
[1:17:05] fires of God once your life is and all
[1:17:09] the dross is burned out and you're clean
[1:17:12] before the Lord and you've laid in this
[1:17:14] fire praise God you've remained on the
[1:17:20] altar of God when we preach on that
[1:17:22] state keeping on yourself on the altar
[1:17:23] of God present your body as a living
[1:17:26] sacrifice so you keep your body keep
[1:17:29] your mind your thoughts
[1:17:31] on the author of God and let God's altar
[1:17:33] fire burn away all your dross when it's
[1:17:41] completely done baptize you with the
[1:17:43] Holy Ghost how many could say amen to
[1:17:44] that
[1:17:45] oh thank you lord okay now back to
[1:17:49] Philippians I want to bring that out
[1:17:51] there praise God I never really got to
[1:17:55] finish it I kind of felt bad I wonder
[1:17:56] and that's not the full finish but
[1:17:58] that's about it
[1:17:59] good that's good for now by God's grace
[1:18:02] thank the Lord so with all the power at
[1:18:10] his disposal he could ask anything you
[1:18:12] can ask the Father anything he showed
[1:18:15] his mind was I got to humble myself and
[1:18:18] I've got to obey isn't it simple church
[1:18:23] doesn't Christianity become so simple
[1:18:25] when we look at the scripture well Jesse
[1:18:27] I want to be anointed I would have Auto
[1:18:29] I don't have the mind of Christ obey
[1:18:32] praise not obey humble yourself and obey
[1:18:36] that's the mind of Christ put yourself
[1:18:41] in the fire of God in the prends of God
[1:18:43] he'll burn away any questions or any
[1:18:45] doubt any excuses they'll burn away all
[1:18:48] the dross and what's left will be pure
[1:18:51] silver oh thank the heart
[1:18:54] hallelujah remember the holiest of
[1:18:57] Holies remember the outer core had brass
[1:18:59] and silver
[1:19:00] the inner core the hold of the holy
[1:19:03] place had gold and silver but the holy
[1:19:06] place a horse voice was all gold named
[1:19:09] God see there was Redemption going on
[1:19:15] see there's redemption through
[1:19:17] justification sanctification there's a
[1:19:19] Redemption going on those seven
[1:19:21] purifying agents with the Holy of Holies
[1:19:23] there's only God there's only deity
[1:19:26] there's only the Holy Spirit their
[1:19:28] praise God hey man oh my just goes
[1:19:31] together perfectly doesn't it well thank
[1:19:34] the Lord Jesus praise God
[1:19:39] thank you lord so the mind of Christ is
[1:19:43] that I'm a great big somebody I'm
[1:19:45] equally God no it's homing yourself so I
[1:19:47] can do what God I can obey what God
[1:19:49] wants me to obey
[1:19:51] that's the anointing of God it's not
[1:19:58] well I'm the bride and look what I can
[1:19:59] do and I wrote the Bible and I can I'm a
[1:20:03] miracle worker and all these great
[1:20:04] things yeah you might be but first you
[1:20:07] got to humble yourself become obedient
[1:20:09] and do the works that the father wants
[1:20:12] you to do thank you lord
[1:20:17] okay let's clip in let's finish up here
[1:20:20] okay good now here nine through 11 is
[1:20:25] some of the most beautiful poetry
[1:20:28] scholars say they say this is some of
[1:20:30] the most beautiful poetry in all
[1:20:31] scripture some some ages have actually
[1:20:36] used this as a Creed because it's so
[1:20:38] beautiful verse nine
[1:20:41] so before we read nine again god only
[1:20:47] does this because Jesus took the mind of
[1:20:50] a servant and obedient humble lowliness
[1:20:54] of mind he only does that or he only
[1:20:57] exhaustion because Christ did that first
[1:21:00] night wherefore God also hath highly
[1:21:02] exalted him and given him a name which
[1:21:06] is above every name that at the name of
[1:21:09] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[1:21:13] heaven and things in earth and things
[1:21:15] under the earth and that every tongue
[1:21:18] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:21:21] to the glory of God the Father how many
[1:21:26] people on earth right now you should bow
[1:21:28] to him praise God right
[1:21:30] the Bible says everything will bow even
[1:21:33] on earth or in heaven under the earth
[1:21:35] everything will bow and I'm talking
[1:21:38] about not just bowing on your knee I'm
[1:21:40] talking about bowing down your will and
[1:21:42] becoming obedient to the cross that's
[1:21:45] what we're talking about bowing to every
[1:21:47] word of God there's anybody at church
[1:21:51] today any
[1:21:52] Church can maou their need and you know
[1:21:53] the catholics do i will you last night
[1:21:55] with oh they got the benches there
[1:21:56] people got on there are black benches
[1:21:58] and they had their prayer beads there
[1:21:59] anybody can bow that's not what it's
[1:22:02] really talking about it's all about who
[1:22:03] can be obedient to the word glory so the
[1:22:14] highest exaltation comes to the lowest
[1:22:19] servant amen proving the way up is down
[1:22:25] the highest name the highest praise goes
[1:22:29] to the one who became the lowest of all
[1:22:31] of us the weakest of all of us the most
[1:22:36] despised of all of us the most hated of
[1:22:38] all of us the one who became the lowest
[1:22:40] now becomes the highest church don't
[1:22:44] feel bad if you're the least despised in
[1:22:45] your family praise God don't feel bad if
[1:22:49] you're the black sheep of the family
[1:22:51] don't feel bad if you're the black sheep
[1:22:53] of the church right don't feel bad if
[1:22:56] you're the black sheep of YouTube or the
[1:22:59] black sheep of the message preachers
[1:23:01] don't feel bad if you're the loved us
[1:23:03] and most despised and rejected your your
[1:23:06] duty is just to obey the word amen we
[1:23:09] just must humble ourselves and become
[1:23:13] obedient to God's will for our lives and
[1:23:16] have loneliness of mine and simply obey
[1:23:18] God's Word and the Bible said if you
[1:23:20] humble yourself God will exalt you in
[1:23:22] due season the lowest is exalted to the
[1:23:33] highest thank you lord
[1:23:40] verses twelve to sixteen I'm closing
[1:23:42] with 12 to 16 ah I was looking to verse
[1:23:52] 17 I must have to hold out for next time
[1:23:55] back that's great
[1:23:57] verse 12 wherefore my beloved as ye have
[1:24:01] always obeyed wow this is a church that
[1:24:04] always obeyed the Lord now of course we
[1:24:08] know he's talking about God right in
[1:24:09] God's sight we boys obey right because
[1:24:11] we own our souls do not sin the soul
[1:24:14] does not sin because the seed of God
[1:24:16] remains in the believer but now much
[1:24:22] more in my absence work out your own
[1:24:27] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:24:31] oh brother Jess I'm equal with God I've
[1:24:35] got the Holy Ghost
[1:24:35] I've got a portion of eternal life in me
[1:24:37] hallelujah bless God I'm III and Paul
[1:24:43] says take them take the mind of Christ
[1:24:47] see how little you can become see how
[1:24:52] humble you can become he said work out
[1:24:54] your own salvation with fear and
[1:24:58] trembling see Church that's what's kind
[1:25:02] of I'm sure Karen and others can admit
[1:25:05] in the days past people used to come to
[1:25:08] church fearing and trembling yeah you
[1:25:12] see them praying before service they're
[1:25:13] you know they're fearing the trembling
[1:25:14] weeping what happens as time goes on you
[1:25:17] see a lot less of it
[1:25:19] seekers we're getting towards the end
[1:25:21] right going toward the end but Paul says
[1:25:24] if you've got the mind of Christ and you
[1:25:26] become a servant and humble yourself he
[1:25:30] said you'll work out your salvation with
[1:25:32] fear and trembling in other words you
[1:25:35] won't take God's word lightly right you
[1:25:39] won't take your Christian experience
[1:25:41] lightly you'll in other words you'll
[1:25:43] care about it you'll be so concerned
[1:25:46] sometimes you'll tremble in the Friends
[1:25:48] of the Lord praise God
[1:25:53] you'll be so you'll be so respectful
[1:25:56] that the Bible calls it fear and it
[1:25:58] actually means terrified it actually
[1:25:59] means terrified you're terrified in the
[1:26:02] presence of the Lord with fear and
[1:26:04] trembling and I just put this little I
[1:26:08] kind of used some of the words but I
[1:26:09] kind of twisted or not twist but I added
[1:26:11] my own little I customized it so the
[1:26:13] outworking so this these scriptures on
[1:26:16] the out working of the inward working
[1:26:19] salvation and those who have the
[1:26:21] loneliness of mind in other words this
[1:26:26] is what we'll see on the outside if
[1:26:28] you've got the mind of Christ
[1:26:30] if you and I have the mind of Christ
[1:26:33] we'll be working out our salvation in
[1:26:35] fear and trembling how many believe that
[1:26:38] there'll be times we'll be so fearful in
[1:26:41] God's presence will be trembling in
[1:26:43] God's presence right because we want to
[1:26:46] we're working it out we're trying to
[1:26:49] reach the finish line amen
[1:26:50] we're trying to be the winner of the
[1:26:53] race right Paul said run the race he
[1:26:56] said bring your body into subjection as
[1:26:58] if you would be the one who would win
[1:27:00] praise God he said approach this with
[1:27:05] fear and trembling so here's the Greek
[1:27:12] for work so work out perform your
[1:27:15] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:27:16] accomplished I like that word achieve
[1:27:19] your salvation with fear and trembling
[1:27:22] in other words reached the goal praise
[1:27:23] God you achieve it remember God is going
[1:27:30] to save us because we chose to be saved
[1:27:32] because we submit our free moral agency
[1:27:36] God's not going to force us to heaven
[1:27:38] forces to the rapture is because we
[1:27:40] decided we - we took God's present we
[1:27:43] accepted God's presence and yes I think
[1:27:45] that salvation ain't net he's not gonna
[1:27:48] force us so the part of it our victory
[1:27:52] is faith faith is our victory where we
[1:27:55] accomplish the salvation he said perform
[1:27:58] your salvation with fear and trembling
[1:28:09] now I'll say like this Johnny Graham and
[1:28:11] I used to talk about this there's times
[1:28:13] we feel like we're acting as Christians
[1:28:15] because our bodies don't feel like going
[1:28:17] to church right or our bodies don't like
[1:28:20] feel if you like reading the Bible or
[1:28:22] praying
[1:28:22] so yes church you've got to perform it
[1:28:24] you've got to go through the acts and
[1:28:26] preform the the salvation works of God
[1:28:31] you've just got to perform it until you
[1:28:34] can get under the anointing of the Holy
[1:28:36] Spirit
[1:28:38] okay cuz your body the Bible says you're
[1:28:41] your body and mind is enmity against God
[1:28:45] most of time your body and mind don't
[1:28:47] want to think about the things of God so
[1:28:49] that's why he says work it out you've
[1:28:51] got to just choose to do it you don't
[1:28:53] feel like it
[1:28:54] you just got to choose it you've got to
[1:28:56] work it out in other words let the soul
[1:28:59] let the will of the soul work out
[1:29:02] through your mind and your body bring
[1:29:04] this objection bringing the captivity
[1:29:06] and be a real worshiper of God
[1:29:12] that's good praise God huh baby thank
[1:29:15] you I'm just saying amen to the Lord
[1:29:16] here not to myself to the Lord
[1:29:20] we're performant you say you're saved
[1:29:24] performance act like you're saved be a
[1:29:29] worshiper right be obedient oh I was it
[1:29:31] be obedient to the death of the cross
[1:29:33] your cross take up your cross trembling
[1:29:36] quaking with fear I like this one who
[1:29:42] distrust that's what we saw this morning
[1:29:44] you distrust your ability you distrust
[1:29:47] your flesh right lowliness of mind I
[1:29:50] have a deep sense of my moral little
[1:29:53] littleness the Greeks said see I
[1:29:58] distrust my ability completely to meet
[1:30:01] all God's requirements my flesh is not
[1:30:03] going to meet God's requirements it
[1:30:06] doesn't want to meet God's requirements
[1:30:08] so I got to work it out I've got to just
[1:30:11] let the Holy Spirit I got to bring
[1:30:14] everything into subjection to the Holy
[1:30:16] Spirit so I can meet all the require
[1:30:24] thank the Lord
[1:30:27] now how many earlier said they want they
[1:30:29] all want the same mind how many can we
[1:30:31] get some hands out there who who said
[1:30:33] okay good this is all right this is all
[1:30:36] leaning into that we all say oh I want
[1:30:39] to be in one accord brother justice okay
[1:30:40] I do too I want to be all I want to be
[1:30:44] like minded like all the other Saints I
[1:30:45] we all want the same thing well this is
[1:30:47] what it is where we all will work out
[1:30:52] we'll perform our salvation with fear
[1:30:54] and trembling and verse 13 is beautiful
[1:31:01] now this is it right here this is what
[1:31:03] I've been trying to say the whole time
[1:31:04] for it is God which worketh in you both
[1:31:09] to will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:31:13] in other words that's living from the
[1:31:15] soul that's letting the desire of the
[1:31:17] soul live out through your life that is
[1:31:21] obeying the Holy Spirit in your soul
[1:31:24] that's obeying and submitting to the
[1:31:26] Holy Spirit in your soul it's God
[1:31:28] working through you amen if you let God
[1:31:31] work through you praise God aren't you
[1:31:35] it doesn't make it happy when you see
[1:31:37] God working through you when other
[1:31:39] people see God working through you that
[1:31:42] that's a time where you can say wow the
[1:31:44] Lord I submitted to the Lord
[1:31:46] I let the Lord work through me and this
[1:31:51] is what Paul says if you want the mind
[1:31:55] of Christ like those other brothers that
[1:31:57] preach the false doctrine they never say
[1:31:59] anything about this I never said
[1:32:01] anything about fearing trembling it was
[1:32:05] just how great they were
[1:32:06] how how equal they were with God how
[1:32:08] powerful they were but Paul says the way
[1:32:11] to do that is through fear and trembling
[1:32:14] and then when we church when we have
[1:32:19] fear and trembling then we'll actually
[1:32:21] be in a spot where we want to obey God's
[1:32:22] Word
[1:32:30] hallelujah
[1:32:32] and god only works in you to the extent
[1:32:34] you let it so see we must sacrifice our
[1:32:39] human will of our mind and our flesh in
[1:32:43] order to do his good pleasure what did I
[1:32:51] do okay now verse 14 I'm not going to
[1:32:55] spend much time on this I want to get
[1:32:56] this sixteen as as I closer 14 do all
[1:33:00] things without murmuring and disputing
[1:33:04] okay so now you know that's not the mind
[1:33:06] of Christ right if we're complaining
[1:33:08] about the mind of Christ if we're
[1:33:12] disputing it's not the mind of Christ
[1:33:16] all things verse 15 that he may be
[1:33:20] blameless and harmless the sons of God
[1:33:22] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:33:24] and perverse nation among whom he shine
[1:33:27] as lights in the world think about
[1:33:33] church think about all the riots going
[1:33:34] on and just think about all the
[1:33:35] lawlessness out there that's all
[1:33:37] darkness those are all bunch of dark I
[1:33:41] just saw today Portland Oregon has had
[1:33:45] what thirty four days of riots in a row
[1:33:48] things burning down everything being
[1:33:50] destroyed those are deemed those are
[1:33:52] demon filled darkness people out there
[1:33:55] they're just filled with the power of
[1:33:56] darkness but here we stand in the house
[1:33:58] of God this evening worshiping God
[1:34:00] praising God we are the light of the
[1:34:03] world praise God others will choose to
[1:34:07] submit to the darkness and live in
[1:34:10] darkness but the Bible says we shine as
[1:34:13] lights in the world when we are
[1:34:17] blameless harmless without rebuke in
[1:34:21] other words when we obey God's Word we
[1:34:23] shine as lights verse 16 holding forth
[1:34:31] the word of life that I may rejoice in
[1:34:36] the day of Christ they have not run in
[1:34:39] vain
[1:34:41] neither labored in vain so what's this
[1:34:44] holding forth mean presenting it church
[1:34:48] all God asks us to do search out our own
[1:34:51] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:34:53] don't complain let God work through you
[1:34:56] and just ho just present the Word of
[1:34:59] Life
[1:35:00] praise God that's all we have to do we
[1:35:03] just have to present the message right
[1:35:05] just present a godly life just present
[1:35:08] holiness under people and about and Paul
[1:35:12] says that's what I'll be called for
[1:35:14] that's what I'll achieve on the day when
[1:35:16] I finish my race he says then I'll
[1:35:19] rejoice in that day that I didn't run I
[1:35:23] didn't waste my life oh how many want to
[1:35:26] make their life a real testament to
[1:35:28] Christ I want my talents I want the
[1:35:34] things God has given me to count for
[1:35:36] something I don't want it to be wasted
[1:35:38] and Paul said this is how we do it we
[1:35:41] approach our salvation with fear and
[1:35:42] trembling we let God work through us
[1:35:44] we're blameless harmless and we just
[1:35:47] present the word of life to people Paul
[1:35:51] says if I do that I know I've run a were
[1:35:56] a worthy life can I say like that your
[1:35:58] life is worthy the gospel praise God
[1:36:01] let's stand here I'll stop right there
[1:36:03] that's my last one that I had anyway
[1:36:09] musicians you're welcome to come there
[1:36:12] children
[1:36:16] isn't that beautiful Church isn't isn't
[1:36:18] this scripture just so beautiful I hope
[1:36:25] this is helping you read your Bible I'm
[1:36:27] not going to ask you raise your hands
[1:36:28] but I hope preaching like this is
[1:36:29] encouraging you and I to read our Bibles
[1:36:32] more just read right down through the
[1:36:34] scripture and see what the Holy Spirit
[1:36:37] can bring out to us now you know like
[1:36:42] brother Branham said all the people that
[1:36:44] are going to be surprised in the Day of
[1:36:46] Judgment they're going to be surprised
[1:36:50] because they didn't do what was already
[1:36:52] given to them the word that they already
[1:36:54] had the scripture was already given to
[1:36:56] him and they're going to be surprised
[1:36:59] because they're gonna think they're
[1:37:00] going to be accepted but they're not
[1:37:01] because they didn't do what was simply
[1:37:03] given to them the Word of God
[1:37:08] now how many want to do Philippians
[1:37:10] chapter 2 how many want to search out
[1:37:12] your salvation with fear and trembling
[1:37:14] how many really want the mind of Christ
[1:37:17] amen humbling yourselves obedient unto
[1:37:23] picking up your cross daily praise God

[1:37:34] for this word that we work tonight

[1:37:54] wind up missing the God's will

[1:38:00] search out my salvation that's the
[1:38:03] answer that's those Souls it so they
