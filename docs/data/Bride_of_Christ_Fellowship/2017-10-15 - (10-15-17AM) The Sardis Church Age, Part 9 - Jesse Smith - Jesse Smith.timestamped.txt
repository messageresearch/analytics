[39:13] went lead me you know Jesus said I will
[39:14] confess your name before my father in
[39:17] his holy angels that's the thought I
[39:19] just want to by God's grace want to
[39:21] bring out this morning as we look to the
[39:23] Lord let's read verse five together and
[39:26] then I'll read verse six one two three
[39:29] he that overcometh the same shall be
[39:32] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[39:35] blot out his name out of the book of
[39:37] life but I will confess his name before
[39:40] my father and before his angels I'll
[39:43] just read verse six he that hath an ear
[39:45] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[39:47] the churches that's just by our heads a
[39:49] word of Prayer if you just like the Lord
[39:51] to remember you this morning if you'd
[39:52] like to hear what the Spirit saying just
[39:54] maybe signify by raising your hand or
[39:56] just speak into the Lord as we pray
[39:58] Heavenly Father were humbled Lord by
[40:01] your presence we're grateful Lord that
[40:03] you meet with us Lord God who are we
[40:05] Lord that you would come and minister to
[40:07] us Lord but father were grateful Lord
[40:10] that you look you look to our hearts
[40:12] Lord and you look to the sacrifice
[40:14] or we're looking Lord our our eyes are
[40:17] looking at the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:18] this morning Lord because of your
[40:20] sacrifice Lord we can have fellowship
[40:22] today Lord we ask that your spear would
[40:24] minister to us Lord worthy unworthy ones
[40:27] yet you make us worthy by your grace and
[40:29] mercy help us to hear the word of God
[40:31] help us to hear what the Spirit is
[40:33] saying to the churches and Lord as we
[40:35] look at this thought one day Lord you
[40:37] will confess our name before your father
[40:39] and we want to be it Lord in a way of a
[40:43] reward dear God we want to live a life
[40:46] worthy of the gospel Lord so just take
[40:49] this little thought Lord God I've just

[40:53] pray you administer this thought now to
[40:54] our hearts we love you Jesus and father
[40:57] for your minister now in Jesus Christ's
[40:59] name never said Amen god bless use me
[41:01] and see you there praise God preciate
[41:18] that bow thank you for thinking about
[41:20] the Saints brother I appreciate that
[41:21] thank you so let's look at part 9 here
[41:28] this morning by God's grace okay you can
[41:30] switch over buddy whenever you get a
[41:32] chance I would like to look at this
[41:34] thought here and I went through a few
[41:36] quotes you know this week you know
[41:38] Wednesday night we looked a little more
[41:40] at the book of life and I just want to
[41:42] just rehearse that there's our scripture
[41:46] that we read today I just want to
[41:47] rehearse this quote real quick where the
[41:49] Branham said there's benefits of sitting
[41:50] under the the pastoral ministry and it's
[41:53] the benefit of teaching verse by verse
[41:55] but mam said evangelists can't do that
[41:58] so Bram says you know he talks about he
[42:00] stayed a year in six months on the book
[42:02] of Revelation at the tabernacle he said
[42:03] oh I just love teaching he said it gives
[42:06] the basis and it settles the church so
[42:09] you know if the Lord is leading me to
[42:10] stay on a topic you know for a long time
[42:12] and maybe maybe you're wondering why
[42:16] it's to give everybody a foundation and
[42:19] maybe you've already heard it before but
[42:21] you know if you pull on God you can pull
[42:22] out something that you need amen brother
[42:24] Mannis I never went to church and left
[42:26] disappoint it so you can pull whatever
[42:28] you have
[42:28] made of out of God but it really settles
[42:31] the church and gives them a great
[42:32] foundation and as I've gone through and
[42:34] preached the seven church ages I've seen
[42:37] how it reveals how everybody goes
[42:39] through all these battles you know you
[42:41] lose your first love and and then you
[42:43] know there's temptations and there's
[42:46] there's test there's tribulation you go
[42:48] through as a Christian you know and then
[42:51] you got to stand you got to you got to
[42:52] hold on to everything you know that
[42:55] that's you lose don't you don't lose
[42:56] your reward you know Paul said there
[42:58] Jesus said that and there's so many
[43:00] things that we can see in our lives our
[43:02] last work should be more than our first
[43:04] we should increase our service to God
[43:06] not decrease it
[43:07] but Jesus said your last work should be
[43:09] more than your first that's a great
[43:11] mystery revelation I thought God gave us
[43:13] from the church age book there and then
[43:16] you know brother Brad was teaching the
[43:17] adoption series and he reads Ephesians 1
[43:19] and 4 and he said this book is not
[43:20] addressed evangelists so an evangelist
[43:24] is not going to come and teach us the
[43:25] book of Ephesians you might hit a few
[43:27] things but he said he said this is a he
[43:29] said I don't touch this on the fields I
[43:31] bring this to the church in other words
[43:33] I bring this to the local assembly so
[43:35] that's why we go verse by verse it's so
[43:37] critical some of my favorite sermons God
[43:40] has had me preach are the ones where we
[43:41] just preach whole books of the Bible
[43:43] like Esther Nehemiah Ezra you know we
[43:46] went through some of those and some of
[43:47] the most memorable ones the Book of
[43:48] Daniel we just got through that this
[43:49] year how God has just led us verse by
[43:51] verse good book of Galatians last year
[43:54] because it gives us a foundation Amen so
[43:56] we're very thankful for that now I want
[43:58] to look at this thought here I'll
[44:00] confess his name before my father and
[44:02] his angels so my inspiration comes from
[44:06] the next quote its action the church age
[44:08] book from the Sardis church age it
[44:10] speaks of to roll calls in heaven the
[44:14] first is after the rapture and the
[44:17] second is at the white throne judgment
[44:19] there's really two roll calls or to name
[44:21] callings in Scripture if you're if
[44:26] you're if you're familiar with this the
[44:29] Prophet quotes the scripture he said
[44:30] roll call in heaven if a man die shall
[44:34] he live again all the days of my
[44:35] appointed time will I wait till my
[44:37] change comes the body change thou shalt
[44:41] call
[44:42] and I will answer thee that would have a
[44:44] desire for the work of thy hands the
[44:47] Prophet said the great Shepherd is
[44:48] calling his sheep by name look at this
[44:52] the creative voice of God is calling
[44:55] them forth from the dust or changing
[44:58] their atoms even though they had not
[45:00] fallen asleep this is speaking of the
[45:02] rapture it is the rapture it is the
[45:07] great marriage supper of the lamb and
[45:09] his bride can you say Amen oh yeah amen
[45:13] I'll say Amen thank you Jesus oh my just
[45:18] to see that there's there's really two
[45:19] callings of the names one of the rapture
[45:22] and the other is at the white throne
[45:24] judgment Loretta said but the rapture is
[45:28] not the only roll call I want to be in
[45:31] that I want to be in the first number
[45:33] Church I'm gonna be like Paul we said on
[45:35] Wednesday night I'll do anything to
[45:37] obtain to that first resurrection I
[45:39] won't let anything get in front of
[45:40] Christ
[45:41] I want Christ first in my life there at
[45:45] the second resurrection at the great
[45:46] right throne we'll names be confessed
[45:48] before the father and his angels now
[45:52] I've been told by those who know the
[45:53] sweetest sound to human ears the sound
[45:55] of that person's name how many could
[45:57] agree to that
[45:58] I would agree how people love to have
[46:01] their names before the public right how
[46:05] they love a claim recognition but no
[46:08] earthly voice will ever sound your name
[46:10] as sweetly as will the voice of God if
[46:11] your name is in the book of life and
[46:14] remains there to be revealed before the
[46:17] holy angels what a day that will be when
[46:20] we hear Jesus say father can I just put
[46:22] my name in there Jesse Smith confess my
[46:25] name before men in the days of his
[46:27] earthly pilgrimage now I will confess
[46:29] his name before you and all the holy
[46:31] angels you can put your name in there
[46:34] too Oh hallelujah I've had my name
[46:37] announced at Ohio State football stadium
[46:39] in front of a hundred thousand people
[46:40] that don't mean nothing to me
[46:42] I want my name announced before God amen
[46:44] and crisis say well done good and
[46:47] faithful servant that's the kind of name
[46:49] that's the kind of name calling and
[46:51] confessing I want to hear praise God
[46:52] that's eternal hallelujah
[46:55] now put a little blank slide here cuz
[46:56] I'm switching over to some different
[46:57] colors so sorry about your eyes it's
[46:59] here oh no I'm sorry okay yeah this is
[47:02] my reminder to switch back I put the
[47:04] other quotes in here so sorry pardon me
[47:08] now I want to just before we get in this
[47:10] last week brother Brooks said he
[47:11] preached some rough words to us I just
[47:14] want to remind us a few these things and
[47:15] I just want to remind us to give our be
[47:17] as sincere as we can before the Lord I
[47:18] just want to just remind us let's be as
[47:21] sincere as we can for church where the
[47:23] Brooks sat at 51 minutes and you can
[47:24] listen to I went back and listened to
[47:25] the message well the Brooks said God
[47:28] don't like starchiness he said God don't
[47:32] like stiff and starchy church folk
[47:33] you're going to have to pull better than
[47:35] you were doing and he said do I sound
[47:38] rough to you he said I hope I do in
[47:42] church I don't know if I ever been that
[47:43] rough I don't know if I've ever been
[47:44] that rough to the home church but I hope
[47:46] if I have forgive me unless it was God
[47:49] you know I only want to bring correction
[47:51] if it's God's Spirit but brother Brooks
[47:53] said I hope I do sound rough to you I
[47:54] hope I'm sounding rough he said we're
[47:56] supposed to be super on fire we need
[48:00] some fire I get jealous for my lord he's
[48:03] worthy to be praised and then he said
[48:06] I'm coming in here you're supposed to
[48:07] blow me away with your amens and I
[48:12] thought you know that scriptural Jesus
[48:13] said as many as I love I rebuke and
[48:16] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[48:19] I just want to remind the church you
[48:22] know that just we want to be a sincere
[48:24] as we can be it's not always in the
[48:26] amount of the emotion or it's not always
[48:28] how loud we are but it's in our
[48:31] sincerity because brother brand there's
[48:34] two different quotes one one quote
[48:35] brother Branham says heaven is a loud
[48:37] place and we should have it loud here
[48:38] and another message he said things that
[48:41] are great are quiet he says he talks
[48:44] about the planets rotating he said
[48:47] they're going a hundred thousand or a
[48:48] thousand miles per hour rotating and he
[48:50] said you don't even hear one little
[48:52] sound so there's a balance but I don't
[48:57] want to ever discourage anybody if
[48:58] you're the kind who likes it loud I'm
[48:59] the kind of likes to go like this one
[49:00] song service and I like to shout and
[49:02] praise God I like to move you know but
[49:06] you're the one who knows if you're
[49:07] giving God your all
[49:09] and there's no really level noise level
[49:11] that's needed unless you know that
[49:12] that's what you need but just remember
[49:15] you know we should take correction
[49:16] because brother branham can he said I
[49:17] condemned the church with the latest
[49:20] message in other words I corrected I
[49:22] tried to bring correction to the church
[49:24] that had the most recent message so we
[49:26] should expect correction when we come to
[49:28] the house of God where the RAM says it's
[49:31] in questions and answers he said now a
[49:33] great part of my congregation is made up
[49:34] of Pentecostal people and become because
[49:37] Pentecost is the latest message that we
[49:39] have in denomination ranks and to me I
[49:41] certainly agree with them more than any
[49:42] of their denominational Church I hang
[49:44] towards a Pentecostal because it's the
[49:46] lair message and all I wanted to
[49:48] emphasize that all my converts that I
[49:52] bring to Christ I try to direct them to
[49:53] some Pentecostal church but I've
[49:56] condemned them in every way that I know
[49:58] how that they were wrong in the
[50:00] scripture by being a denomination and
[50:02] not willing to walk in the light when
[50:04] lights presented to them we got if I had
[50:08] to take my choice to any church in the
[50:09] world I'd take Pentecostal when it come
[50:11] the denomination I know we're passed
[50:14] we're past the age where we have
[50:15] churches now that are not we're met we
[50:17] have messy churches so our churches now
[50:19] are the latest message churches is every
[50:21] understand that and so I just thought of
[50:24] this scripture you know therefore let us
[50:25] keep the feast not with old leaven
[50:26] neither with leaven a mouth sore and
[50:28] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[50:30] of sincerity and truth you you and I
[50:33] need to be able to be mature enough
[50:34] where we know am I giving God my all
[50:36] this service am I trying to get in the
[50:38] spirit or am I just trying to get
[50:41] through the service and and then then
[50:44] you're the judge of that you know then
[50:46] you get exactly what you come for
[50:47] praise God then you can be happy leaving
[50:50] here I got exactly what I came for
[50:52] because I put everything into it that I
[50:54] possibly could so we just want to be
[50:56] sincere I don't want to be sincere
[50:57] before the Lord so it's up to us you
[51:00] know it's up to you it's up to it's
[51:01] myself we've got to get in the spirit we
[51:03] got to get out of the flesh now here's
[51:05] my thought you know I took that thought
[51:07] we're brother Branham said that about
[51:08] not only there's no two roll calls
[51:10] there's roll call for the rapture and
[51:11] there's roll call for the white throne
[51:14] judgment and then I just you know I just
[51:15] want to but make a screen here of a
[51:17] potential order and I just kind of want
[51:20] to look at the order the first event
[51:22] is the rapture and then after that
[51:25] there's the presentation of each bride
[51:27] aged to Christ now this is what I
[51:29] believe I'm just gonna preach it the way
[51:31] I can see it in the Word of God so after
[51:33] the rapture when we go to the marriage
[51:34] supper of the lamb as soon as we get
[51:36] there I believe we'll have the
[51:37] presentation of each bride to Christ
[51:39] because brother Branham said the
[51:41] marriage supper is actually the wedding
[51:43] between Christ and the church how many
[51:45] knew that we're engaged right now we're
[51:48] engaged and we have an invisible union
[51:49] and yes we're engaged in our souls or
[51:51] we're married in our souls but it's
[51:52] still the invisible union where the Bram
[51:54] said we're not married yet until we
[51:56] physically be with the body of Christ
[51:58] amen but that's the real physical
[52:00] marriage we'd say when our bodies are
[52:02] changed in his glorious but like his in
[52:04] the glorious body and then there'll be
[52:07] some rewards I believe and I put a
[52:08] question mark here cuz I'm not sure when
[52:09] the rewards actually are but then we
[52:11] have the marriage supper across the
[52:12] table and there's Armageddon and when we
[52:15] return you know Armageddon with Jesus
[52:17] and I said maybe the rewards are either
[52:21] before during the Millennium I'm not
[52:22] sure but I just feel like they're right
[52:24] there at the before the marriage supper
[52:25] then the millennium reign where we rule
[52:28] over nations and then the white throne
[52:29] judgment and that's where I'm going to
[52:31] by God's grace so that's kind of my
[52:33] thought taking here I want to look at
[52:35] some of these quotations before so can't
[52:39] ready see what we want to look at we
[52:40] won't look at when Christ will confess
[52:42] your name
[52:43] he's either couldn't gonna confess your
[52:44] name at the rapture or he's gonna
[52:46] confess your name at the white throne
[52:47] judgment and how many want to be the
[52:49] rapture well then brother man tells us
[52:51] this is how we make ready for the
[52:53] marriage supper brother BAM the part of
[52:55] the batteries the Prophet said the
[52:56] church now is engaged to Christ for the
[52:59] wedding the wedding has never been
[53:01] performed yet so see we haven't had the
[53:04] wedding yet because when I got married
[53:06] my wife went home with me and we're not
[53:08] with Jesus yet are we we're not
[53:10] physically with the body of Jesus his
[53:11] spirit is with us were born again the
[53:13] soul so brother Branham says were
[53:15] engaged
[53:16] he said the wedding has never been
[53:19] performed yet it will be at the wedding
[53:21] supper of the Lamb and there's numerous
[53:22] quotes on this there's like six quotes
[53:24] on this I just put this one on here just
[53:25] to save some time so we see that the
[53:28] church is now engaged like a man engaged
[53:30] to his wife what does he do while
[53:32] they're engaged
[53:33] he's just bestowing all kinds of things
[53:35] send
[53:36] your presents making her feel good are
[53:38] you feeling good this morning
[53:39] Christ is supposed to make us feel good
[53:41] as the rapture approaches he said well
[53:44] that's what Christ is doing this church
[53:46] he's sending us gifts of the Spirit how
[53:49] can you be engaged when then when you're
[53:52] denying those gifts exist it's the very
[53:54] love tokens it's God's token to the
[53:56] church jesus said these signs shall
[53:59] follow them that believe aren't you glad
[54:02] when the gifts operate praise God oh we
[54:04] don't have an operation like maybe 1st
[54:06] Corinthians 14 but we're grateful when
[54:08] the gifts do operate and I'm believing -
[54:10] like brother Brooks said I'm believing
[54:11] I'm confessing that over the church I
[54:13] hope you're confessing it over your life
[54:14] - that there's going to be more of the
[54:16] Holy Ghost there's going to be a great
[54:17] outpouring for you and I praise God we
[54:20] have to believe that it's actually
[54:22] prophetic there is a ladder rain to come
[54:24] amen so I'm going to say thank you Jesus
[54:28] for sending your gifts amen now I'm
[54:30] jumping to another quote brother Rams
[54:32] closing the service on the token the
[54:33] first time he preached it
[54:34] he said now just surrender your life to
[54:36] him he's singing I love him because he
[54:38] first loved me love love love him see
[54:41] what he done for you I love him it's by
[54:45] love love brings obedience love brings
[54:49] courtship love brings marriage and
[54:53] that's where we're headed the marriage
[54:57] supper of the Lamb I hear my Savior
[55:00] calling and he loves me - just all your
[55:02] heart just feel something real sweetly
[55:04] coming into you he said that's the Holy
[55:06] Spirit love we've got to love gathering
[55:10] together we got a love singing we've got
[55:12] a love hearing the preaching of the word
[55:14] we got love saying Amen we got love
[55:16] saying thank you Jesus amen
[55:17] it's love love is gonna bring the
[55:20] courtship and love is gonna bring the
[55:22] marriage in the sky it's gonna be love
[55:26] so the Prophet now moving now to the
[55:29] marriage supper the Prophet the rapture
[55:31] is followed by the marriage supper of
[55:33] the Lamb in the last three and a half
[55:34] years I remember we have to speed up to
[55:37] go to the next dimension so things will
[55:39] go really fast in that other dimension a
[55:41] lot can take place in three-and-a-half
[55:44] human years that can we're talking about
[55:46] a lot can take place in the sixth and
[55:47] seventh dimension right
[55:49] - what can happen down here for three
[55:51] and a half years the private talks and
[55:53] he and he types it - Joseph how Joseph
[55:55] put away his bride before he revealed
[55:58] himself to his brother and I'm not gonna
[55:59] read all that you know that for 3 and
[56:02] 1/2 years while the retributive wrath of
[56:05] God has poured out she will be in the
[56:08] great marriage supper the lamb that's
[56:11] where she'll be she'll be in the
[56:14] marriage supper the lamb hallelujah I
[56:16] like that now then we when he returned
[56:20] leaving his bride his father's house
[56:21] while he makes himself known to his
[56:23] brethren at this very time the
[56:24] antichrist covenant that the jews of may
[56:26] with rome will be broken Rome and her
[56:29] allies then send their troops to destroy
[56:31] all of the god-fearing word abiding Jews
[56:34] now I just wanted I just thought I'd
[56:36] read this with the great power the
[56:38] church systems will persecute the true
[56:40] bride that's where our persecution is
[56:41] going to come from the American churches
[56:43] and politics can brace amen that's
[56:45] what's going to happen before the
[56:47] rapture as far as we know they're gonna
[56:49] try to bring that they're gonna get
[56:50] close to that squeeze to bring it down
[56:52] because they have to be able to put
[56:53] force after the bride leaves they got to
[56:54] be able to force it where you'll die if
[56:56] you don't take the mark of the beast so
[56:58] we got to get close up there and
[57:00] experience little bit of a squeeze this
[57:02] image will try to keep the bride from
[57:04] preaching and teaching etc her ministers
[57:06] will be forbidden to give comfort and
[57:08] true to the people who need it but
[57:09] before the Antichrist and person takes
[57:12] over the complete world system of
[57:14] churches the true church will be taken
[57:16] away from this world to be with the Lord
[57:18] God will catch away his bride for the
[57:20] great marriage supper of the Lamb now
[57:22] here's why I believe the presentation of
[57:25] each bride from each age by the
[57:28] messenger is the first thing that
[57:30] happens once we get to the seventh
[57:31] dimension here's what I believe it
[57:34] because the Prophet teaches this and
[57:35] uses second Corinthians 11:2 so this is
[57:38] the scripture right here here's the
[57:40] quote now each of the messages is
[57:44] directed to the angel human messenger -
[57:47] a very great responsibility as well as a
[57:49] wonderful privileges as lot to these men
[57:52] God makes special promises in the case
[57:54] of the 12 apostles sitting on the twelve
[57:56] Thrones judging the twelve tribes of
[57:57] Israel then remember Paul was given a
[58:00] special promise that of presenting the
[58:02] people of the bro
[58:03] side of his day to Jesus amen
[58:07] Paul said that I may present you as a
[58:10] chaste virgin to Christ Paul's going to
[58:13] present the Corinthian church the
[58:14] Galatian Church all the churches he
[58:16] established he's going to present them
[58:18] and say Jesus
[58:19] here's your bride amen here's what we
[58:22] labored for here's all the prayers and
[58:24] the fasting and the preaching here's
[58:25] what it produced a bride without spot or
[58:28] wrinkle or blemish hey man how'd it
[58:30] happen by the Holy Ghost amen
[58:33] so it will be with every messenger who
[58:37] has been faithful to the Word of the
[58:38] hour in his age it will be some last day
[58:41] it'll be the same special reward that
[58:43] was given to Paul I think most remember
[58:44] how I said I'd always been afraid to die
[58:46] lest I should meet the Lord and should
[58:48] not be pleased or he should not be
[58:49] pleased with me as I failed him so many
[58:51] times
[58:51] well I've been thinking that one morning
[58:54] as I lay in bed suddenly I was caught up
[58:56] in a most peculiar vision we might
[58:58] believe it might have been a translation
[58:59] I say it was peculiar for I've had
[59:02] thousands of visions and not once did I
[59:04] seem to leave my body but there I was
[59:06] caught up and I looked back to see my
[59:08] wife and I saw my body laying there
[59:10] beside her then I find myself in the
[59:12] most beautiful place I've ever seen it
[59:14] was a paradise
[59:15] I saw throngs of the most beautiful and
[59:18] happiest people I've ever seen they all
[59:20] look so young about 18 to 21 there was
[59:23] not a gray hair or wrinkle or any
[59:24] deformity amongst them the young women
[59:27] all had hair down to their waist and the
[59:28] young men were so handsome and strong oh
[59:30] they welcomed how they welcomed me they
[59:32] hugged me and called me their darling
[59:34] brother and kept telling me how glad
[59:36] they were to see me as I wondered who
[59:38] all these folks were one Masami said
[59:40] they are your people and I was so
[59:42] astonished ask are all these branham's
[59:44] and he said no they're your converts
[59:47] amen
[59:48] he then pointed to one lady and say see
[59:51] that young lady that you're admiring a
[59:53] moment ago she was 90 years old when you
[59:55] want her to the Lord I said Oh mind the
[59:58] thing that this was I was afraid of the
[59:59] man's that were resting here while
[1:00:02] waiting for the coming of Lord I replied
[1:00:03] I want to see him he said you can't see
[1:00:06] him just yet but he is coming soon and
[1:00:10] when he does he will come to who first
[1:00:13] you first
[1:00:16] and you will be judged according to the
[1:00:18] gospel you have preached now we know
[1:00:21] this can't be the white throne judgment
[1:00:22] because he's filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:23] and we will be your subjects and I said
[1:00:27] do you mean I'm responsible for all
[1:00:29] these he said everyone you were born a
[1:00:31] leader and I asked him will everyone be
[1:00:34] responsible and he what about st. Paul
[1:00:35] answered he'll be responsible for his
[1:00:38] day Jesus actually said generation
[1:00:40] you'll answer for your generation
[1:00:42] remember that we're gonna get to that at
[1:00:44] the end our generation
[1:00:45] someone's gonna answer I'm gonna answer
[1:00:48] for this area if God keeps me here
[1:00:50] there's gonna be somebody answer for
[1:00:52] Lorraine right Lima there's going to be
[1:00:56] somebody answer for every generation
[1:00:57] that's what Jesus said
[1:00:59] every generation he said well I preached
[1:01:04] the same gospel that Paul preached and
[1:01:06] the multitude cried were resting on that
[1:01:08] he said yes I can see that God is going
[1:01:10] to have a special reward to his
[1:01:12] messengers who have faithfully
[1:01:13] discharged the responsibility he has
[1:01:17] placed upon them if they have received
[1:01:19] the revelation of the word for that age
[1:01:20] and faithfully preached in their day and
[1:01:23] live what they preach they'll receive a
[1:01:26] great reward that's all my desire I just
[1:01:28] want to live what I'm preaching amen
[1:01:31] hallelujah I just want to be faithful to
[1:01:33] the word I'm preaching hallelujah now no
[1:01:36] I'm gonna make a now we're gonna bring
[1:01:38] in a dream brother Branham had in the NE
[1:01:40] Sheridan in the the sixth seal in the
[1:01:43] dream I'm about to read brother Neville
[1:01:45] enter before brother Branham he entered
[1:01:48] into the marriage supper but in brother
[1:01:50] bear's vision the voice said the message
[1:01:52] into each age would be judged first I'm
[1:01:54] just saying I can't explain that I don't
[1:01:56] know how brother never would enter
[1:01:57] before the messenger to each age I'm
[1:01:59] just sharing a dream that the Prophet
[1:02:01] had and he called it when the rewards
[1:02:04] I'm sorry when the crowns were given out
[1:02:05] under something you know that's what the
[1:02:07] the vision said the messengers judged
[1:02:10] first but then brother Branham had a
[1:02:12] dream so I'm just sharing it with you
[1:02:13] what I know the sixth seal and I dreamed
[1:02:17] about a month after that I was standing
[1:02:19] one day I was watching a great time not
[1:02:20] the judgment now so not the white throne
[1:02:22] judgment I don't believe that urge every
[1:02:25] life through in judgment I mean the
[1:02:26] bride comes to judgment but I was there
[1:02:29] when the
[1:02:30] pounds was being given out so this is
[1:02:33] the reward but we Paul say we all stand
[1:02:35] before the judgment seat of Christ this
[1:02:37] is the judgment for rewards and the
[1:02:40] great big throne set up there in Jesus
[1:02:42] and the recording angel and all was
[1:02:44] standing there remember just a dream but
[1:02:47] it's very scriptural dream and there was
[1:02:49] a stare likes like coming down this way
[1:02:52] of white ivory run down in a circle and
[1:02:57] so that all this great hosts standing
[1:02:59] out there could see what was happening I
[1:03:00] remember this is where Paul said it why
[1:03:03] do we work and labor here and Laodicea
[1:03:05] because whether we're present here late
[1:03:08] Asiya or we die we want to be accepted
[1:03:10] of him
[1:03:10] that's why we work that's why we labor
[1:03:12] that's why we don't give up that's why
[1:03:14] we increase our service because we want
[1:03:16] Christ to accept us for we must all
[1:03:19] appear before the judgment seat of
[1:03:21] Christ and everyone may receive the
[1:03:24] things done in his body according to
[1:03:25] that that he had done whether it be good
[1:03:27] or bad
[1:03:28] so si will either appear before Christ
[1:03:31] before at the marriage supper or will
[1:03:33] appear at the white throne judgment I
[1:03:35] want to be sitting with him right well
[1:03:38] somewhere behind him at the white throne
[1:03:39] judgment I want to I want to place on
[1:03:42] the throne by Christ because I want to
[1:03:44] be the bride of Jesus Christ I don't
[1:03:47] want to face him at the white throne
[1:03:48] judgment I want to be sitting with him
[1:03:50] and I want to judge his word right
[1:03:52] correct right now amen hallelujah now I
[1:03:56] want to just slide a note in here I'm
[1:03:58] not certain when the crowns are actually
[1:04:00] given out to non apostles what do you
[1:04:04] mean really Jesse well the Bible says
[1:04:06] that 24 elders had their crowns before
[1:04:08] the seals were even open if you read the
[1:04:10] Bible how many know what I'm talking
[1:04:12] about there was 24 elders before the
[1:04:15] seals were ever broken and brought forth
[1:04:17] the 24 elders already had their crowns
[1:04:20] so I'm not sure when the crowns are
[1:04:22] given out and I'll go a step further I'm
[1:04:24] not even certain that we have literal
[1:04:27] crowns if we're not apostles because
[1:04:30] scripture says were crowned with life
[1:04:32] we're crowned with glory and scripture
[1:04:35] says we're clown crown with
[1:04:36] righteousness now revelation 3:11 is one
[1:04:38] that seems where we may receive a
[1:04:40] physical crown but to me it doesn't
[1:04:42] really
[1:04:43] as long as I'm there with Jesus that's
[1:04:45] the only crown I need amen
[1:04:47] hallelujah I don't care they put a crown
[1:04:49] on my head or not just let me be
[1:04:51] accepted by Christ just let me live a
[1:04:53] million just let me live eternally with
[1:04:54] Christ amen it don't matter to me but
[1:04:58] one thing I want I want the crown of
[1:05:00] life I want the crown of righteousness I
[1:05:02] want the crown of glory amen
[1:05:04] that's the crown that were actually
[1:05:06] promised but all three of those Bible
[1:05:09] writers said that James Peter and Paul
[1:05:10] all said we're giving a crown but they
[1:05:12] gave a spiritual crown but we know the
[1:05:16] 24 elders actually have a golden crown
[1:05:18] the Bible said and they throw them down
[1:05:20] before the throne in Revelation 4 verse
[1:05:22] 10 so I just I just don't want to preach
[1:05:24] something less I can know it's at
[1:05:26] exactly in the scripture does anybody
[1:05:27] understand you might wear a crown I
[1:05:29] might I don't know but all I want is
[1:05:31] Jesus so that I think you understand now
[1:05:34] but as I was standing way back to one
[1:05:36] side I was standing there never an idea
[1:05:39] I had to walk up those circular steps up
[1:05:41] to the throne and you remember the
[1:05:44] reason you had this dream because he was
[1:05:45] wondering who he would be married to in
[1:05:47] the future you know in the marriage
[1:05:49] supper of the Lamb and God showed him
[1:05:50] they're both with him
[1:05:51] remember they both came and got a hold
[1:05:53] of his arm hope got this one me too got
[1:05:55] this remember that so that's the reason
[1:05:56] he had this dream I was standing there I
[1:06:00] had seen a recording angel would call
[1:06:02] certain name and I would recognize that
[1:06:04] name I looked and way back out there
[1:06:06] here come the brother walkin or the
[1:06:08] sister walk up like that the recording
[1:06:10] angels standing there by the side of
[1:06:11] Christ just a dream now and was watching
[1:06:13] and their names was there it was found
[1:06:15] in the book of life remember brother
[1:06:17] Branham said this was not the judgment
[1:06:19] this was not the white throne judgment
[1:06:21] this is after the rapture so to see
[1:06:24] there's still books there there's it
[1:06:26] must be the Lamb's Book of Life right it
[1:06:28] must be the Lamb's Book of Life they're
[1:06:29] calling forth all the names that were a
[1:06:32] part of the rapture for the Lamb's Book
[1:06:34] of Life he looked out over them and say
[1:06:36] it was well done my good and faithful
[1:06:37] servant not enter in I look back where
[1:06:40] they was going there was a new world and
[1:06:43] all the joys sew up this circular stairs
[1:06:46] and white throne and everything after
[1:06:49] they would enter in they would enter him
[1:06:50] behind the throne and there be mountains
[1:06:52] and
[1:06:52] a brand new world a joyful world all can
[1:06:55] you see it in your spiritual eyes today
[1:06:57] Church oh there is another land
[1:06:58] hallelujah that we're longing for its
[1:07:01] beauty of land amen that's what we're
[1:07:03] longing for today hallelujah
[1:07:05] and he said entering the joys of the
[1:07:07] Lord has been yours since the foundation
[1:07:09] of the world and I thought oh they go
[1:07:12] through there and meet one another and
[1:07:14] just rejoicing and going over mountains
[1:07:15] and great big places oh can you imagine
[1:07:20] it I thought oh isn't that wonderful
[1:07:22] glory hallelujah just jumping up and
[1:07:24] down see jumping up and down watching
[1:07:26] the saints go into the the mountainous
[1:07:28] area the joyous area oh how many want to
[1:07:30] be there by God's grace oh I want to see
[1:07:32] that hallelujah
[1:07:34] then I hear another name I'd say oh I
[1:07:36] know him I know him there he goes watch
[1:07:38] him and enjoys the Lord oh my praise the
[1:07:41] Lord now this is scriptural because
[1:07:43] Jesus goes through the person who
[1:07:44] received the five talents and he says
[1:07:47] enter into the joy of the Lord
[1:07:49] this is scriptural so this is going to
[1:07:52] happen when the rewards are given out or
[1:07:54] we'd say when all the bride appears
[1:07:55] before the judgment seat of Christ just
[1:07:58] think they'd say ormond Nevel and I'd
[1:08:00] say that's old brother Nevel there he is
[1:08:02] of course he wasn't old anymore
[1:08:04] right and here he come out the crowd and
[1:08:07] I could hear him say Jesus say entering
[1:08:09] the joys the Lord has been prepared for
[1:08:10] you before the foundation will enter in
[1:08:12] and old brother Nevel just change and
[1:08:15] just start back in there just screaming
[1:08:19] and hollering boy and I just shout glory
[1:08:21] to God sitting here by myself having a
[1:08:24] wonderful time watching my brethren go
[1:08:26] in oh ha ha and then he said a recording
[1:08:30] angel said William Branham there's the
[1:08:34] name there's the time where we want
[1:08:36] Jesus to confess our name amen that's
[1:08:38] the time we're hearing your name
[1:08:40] publicly claimed that will be the most
[1:08:42] valuable time your name could ever be
[1:08:45] proclaimed hallelujah but the man said I
[1:08:47] never thought I'd have to walk that so
[1:08:50] then I was scared I thought oh mine will
[1:08:52] I have to do that son walking down there
[1:08:53] and just everybody Pat me say hi brother
[1:08:55] branham god bless you for the RAM
[1:08:56] patting me as I go along through a big
[1:08:58] crowd of people and all of them reaching
[1:09:01] over patting me like god bless you
[1:09:02] brother god bless you brother and I was
[1:09:04] going I said thank you thank you thank
[1:09:05] you like come
[1:09:06] I have a meeting or something you know
[1:09:07] and I was going to have to walk these
[1:09:09] great big ivory steps and I started
[1:09:12] walking up through there as I made the
[1:09:13] first step and I thought I looked at his
[1:09:15] face we looked at Jesus face and I
[1:09:18] thought I want to get a good look at him
[1:09:19] this way and I stopped I had my hands
[1:09:22] like this
[1:09:23] I felt something slipping my arm here it
[1:09:25] was somebody else's arm I looked around
[1:09:27] and there stood hope those big black
[1:09:29] eyes and that dark hair hanging down her
[1:09:30] back white robe on looking up at me like
[1:09:33] that
[1:09:36] and I said hope I felt something hit
[1:09:39] this arm I looked around there was Mita
[1:09:41] those dark eyes looking up in that black
[1:09:43] hair hanging down a white robe on and I
[1:09:44] said me too and they looked at one
[1:09:46] another you know and I got the member
[1:09:48] arms and here he went home I woke up and
[1:09:51] I got up and down in the chair and cried
[1:09:53] you know I thought oh god I hope it
[1:09:56] comes like that now he says why it's
[1:09:59] gonna be a wonderful thing don't miss it
[1:10:01] by the grace of God do all you can do
[1:10:03] and then it'll be up to God to take care
[1:10:06] of the rest of it glory amen
[1:10:11] so see there's gonna be a time where
[1:10:13] we've got to enter it and I believe
[1:10:15] it'll just be like that I believe God
[1:10:16] will go by the ages now remember there
[1:10:20] will be the Old Testament Saints
[1:10:21] standing there as well such a huge
[1:10:23] multitude of witnesses and all the
[1:10:25] angels and they'll call Ephesus and Paul
[1:10:28] will come up first what message did you
[1:10:29] preach Paul and Paul said I'll preach
[1:10:31] the message that Jesus taught me in
[1:10:33] Arabia amen for three years I only I
[1:10:37] learned it and I only preach what Jesus
[1:10:40] revealed to me so Ephesus and then all
[1:10:42] the emphasis Saints one by one have
[1:10:44] their names called amen
[1:10:45] then some Myrna then Pergamos then
[1:10:48] Thyatira hallelujah then Sardis then
[1:10:51] Philadelphia then later to see you and
[1:10:53] God will say William Branham he'll walk
[1:10:56] up his wives there say what message you
[1:10:59] you preach he said I preach exactly what
[1:11:01] Paul preached then hallelujah and then
[1:11:04] one by one will enter into the joys of
[1:11:06] the Lord what a meeting that will be
[1:11:08] hallelujah amen and then I believe it'll
[1:11:13] be time for communion because the bride
[1:11:16] because we always have the bride and
[1:11:19] groom are United before
[1:11:20] we eat right there United before we eat
[1:11:24] so they got to the United the messenger
[1:11:27] has to present the bride to Christ and
[1:11:30] then once they're United in holy
[1:11:32] matrimony divine holy eternal matrimony
[1:11:35] hallelujah then they go in to have the
[1:11:37] wedding supper praise God and Jesus said
[1:11:40] drink ye all the cup on his night he was
[1:11:42] crucified
[1:11:43] I'm sorry rested for this is my blood of
[1:11:45] the New Testament which is shed for the
[1:11:47] many many for the remission of sins but
[1:11:49] I say and you I will not drink
[1:11:50] henceforth of the fruit of this vine
[1:11:51] until that day when I drink it new with
[1:11:54] you in my father's Kingdom see they
[1:11:58] remember the door was there they had to
[1:11:59] walk into the kingdom there's mountains
[1:12:01] and he said Oh a brand new world Oh
[1:12:03] hallelujah I want to walk in there amen
[1:12:05] but I was praying in 1964 in Beaumont
[1:12:09] Tennessee or Texas rather sorry he's
[1:12:13] there sitting at tables and a Christian
[1:12:15] Christian businessmen he said we trust
[1:12:17] that we'll all be there everybody

[1:14:50] many sitting around the table because of
[1:14:52] this effort let me say it again this
[1:14:55] effort let's talk about us
[1:14:58] because of this effort that we're
[1:14:59] putting forth now we'll do all we can do
[1:15:02] Lord we're depending on you to help us
[1:15:05] so all the brother Rams efforts you'd be
[1:15:08] able to look across the table and say
[1:15:09] all because of my efforts I left my
[1:15:11] family
[1:15:12] I left my children but because I went
[1:15:14] these people got saved and they're here
[1:15:17] because of our effort how many wanting
[1:15:18] to give more effort to Christ I don't
[1:15:21] want to give misguided effort I want to
[1:15:23] give effort that I know is thus saith
[1:15:24] the Lord the perfect will of God that's
[1:15:27] the kind of effort I want to invest in
[1:15:28] amen hallelujah I want to know God's
[1:15:31] will and I want to give the effort that
[1:15:33] God's required me to give amen glory so
[1:15:36] I can look across the table with soul
[1:15:38] Satan you're the one that got saved in
[1:15:39] Akron you're the one that got the Holy
[1:15:42] Ghost in Akron hallelujah and because of
[1:15:44] your efforts where he
[1:15:46] here well Christ will wipe away our
[1:15:48] tears and will enter into the joys of
[1:15:50] the Lord Amen let's give some effort
[1:15:53] praise God as I said you know just so
[1:15:56] you know I'm not saying this to exalt us
[1:15:59] or anything but we we supported ro
[1:16:02] Simon's whole trip to Thailand he's
[1:16:03] coming home today and just a weekend
[1:16:05] they had 11 baptisms already and he said
[1:16:07] God has blessed every meeting except one
[1:16:09] people all kinds of people are receiving
[1:16:11] so I told him I said when you get back
[1:16:13] come give us a missionary report but I
[1:16:15] said get some rest first by God's grace
[1:16:17] you see because Bob Ram said if you
[1:16:20] can't go and you send somebody he said
[1:16:22] your church's name is wrapped around
[1:16:23] those crowns or wrapped around those
[1:16:25] believers for all eternity
[1:16:27] if we can't go let's keep sending
[1:16:30] somebody let's give effort let's do
[1:16:31] something for the kingdom of God Oh
[1:16:33] hallelujah because we'll look across the
[1:16:35] table and say oh it's because of your
[1:16:37] church it's because of what you guys is
[1:16:39] because of your effort you did that
[1:16:41] we're here by the grace of God now next
[1:16:46] is our return at Armageddon and then the
[1:16:49] Millennium now I didn't make any quotes
[1:16:51] on this or anything on the Armageddon
[1:16:54] notes in Revelation 19 when Jesus comes
[1:16:56] back the Bible said he's crowned with
[1:16:58] many crowns now that might be the I
[1:17:01] don't know how all the millions of
[1:17:03] believers from the church ages I don't
[1:17:05] know how he's gonna wear that many
[1:17:05] crowns I'm not quite sure that's what I
[1:17:08] don't know if we're all gonna cast our
[1:17:09] crowns over just the 24 elders I don't
[1:17:12] know for sure but one thing's for sure
[1:17:14] he's crowned with many crowns and he
[1:17:16] comes back with his army and they're all
[1:17:18] dressed in white amen and we know that's
[1:17:21] when we return praise God will return at
[1:17:23] Armageddon with Christ and then the
[1:17:26] Millenium in the Millenium the bride
[1:17:28] will rule over nations because remember
[1:17:32] it's going to be a thousand years where
[1:17:34] the nations are gonna grow children will
[1:17:36] be born in the money and they remember
[1:17:37] all those nations that are outside the
[1:17:39] city are going to be deceived by Satan
[1:17:41] and he's going to bring them all
[1:17:43] together around Jerusalem remember that
[1:17:45] but somebody's got to rule over them for
[1:17:48] a thousand years and the Prophet said
[1:17:50] that's the bride because Jesus Christ
[1:17:52] said if you overcome in a fire to your
[1:17:54] church age he said you'll rule over
[1:17:56] nations now let's look at the character
[1:17:59] what is the care
[1:18:00] of somebody who rules over Nations what
[1:18:02] it would look like in laodicea in 2017
[1:18:05] brother Aaron told us I'm sorry to
[1:18:09] switch over to colors I know that hurts
[1:18:10] your eyes forgive me had he the
[1:18:12] overcometh and keepeth my works to the
[1:18:14] end it is very evident from the remarks
[1:18:15] of the spear on works that the Lord is
[1:18:18] trying to get his own to see his opinion
[1:18:20] of righteous works four times he
[1:18:23] mentions work see we gotta give effort
[1:18:25] Church we're not saved by works but we
[1:18:27] want to do works because we want to see
[1:18:28] people saved I want to see somebody
[1:18:30] saved like I'm saved I've always prayed
[1:18:33] that God send people to my church that
[1:18:35] just love God like I do
[1:18:36] let me save somebody I always pray for
[1:18:39] my children God let my children show
[1:18:41] more love than I've showed to you give
[1:18:43] them a double anointing or triple
[1:18:45] annoying thing if I got a double give
[1:18:46] them triple we just want to see people
[1:18:47] love the Lord Jesus a man in sincerity
[1:18:51] and in truth
[1:18:53] give effort for the kingdom of God and
[1:18:55] now he says that he who keeps now
[1:18:58] looking keeps doing his works faithfully
[1:19:00] you got to keep doing the works until
[1:19:02] the end will be given power over nations
[1:19:07] that's what Jesus said he said you'll
[1:19:09] give power
[1:19:09] I'll give you power over nations and
[1:19:11] we'll know who this is what they're
[1:19:13] gonna be they're gonna be strong
[1:19:14] spiritually they're gonna be capable
[1:19:16] unbending ruler and they can handle or
[1:19:20] cope so powerfully with any situation
[1:19:23] that's the kind of person that's going
[1:19:25] to make the rapture that's the kind of
[1:19:26] person that's gonna rule over nations we
[1:19:28] have to be unbending in our convictions
[1:19:30] can you say amen to that we've got to be
[1:19:33] strong in the Lord we've got to be able
[1:19:35] by the Spirit's guidance to handle any
[1:19:38] situation that's what overcomers do they
[1:19:41] handle all the situations by the holy
[1:19:42] spirit now even the most desperate enemy
[1:19:45] enemy will be broken if need be his
[1:19:48] demonstration of rule by power will be
[1:19:51] like unto the very sons just like Jesus
[1:19:55] Oman and this is very amazing how many
[1:19:59] appreciate that the man said it's very
[1:20:02] amazing when we're gonna see people rule
[1:20:03] over nations because they were strong in
[1:20:05] the Lord
[1:20:06] they didn't bend to the pressures of
[1:20:08] Laodicea they were unbending they didn't
[1:20:11] bend to the pressure of family or
[1:20:12] anything at all they didn't
[1:20:14] they just kept the Word of God and they
[1:20:16] handled every situation with the power
[1:20:17] of the Holy Spirit Gloria
[1:20:20] how many want to be one of those I want
[1:20:23] to be one of those I want to handle
[1:20:25] every situation by the power of the Holy
[1:20:26] Spirit now let's jump now to the white
[1:20:29] throne judgment like I said I don't plan
[1:20:31] to preach preach much longer here let me
[1:20:34] set timer here give me 15 more minutes
[1:20:36] I'll try to finish by God's grace the
[1:20:40] white throne judgment now as we looked
[1:20:42] on Wednesday night the white throne
[1:20:44] judgment is a separation of people it's
[1:20:47] the people that are as sheep being
[1:20:49] separated from the goats
[1:20:50] but brother ham said the foolish virgin
[1:20:52] are not truly sheep because they didn't
[1:20:54] receive the Holy Spirit during their
[1:20:56] days on earth they weren't truly sheep
[1:20:58] they they must have been following
[1:20:59] something else rather than the full
[1:21:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost now let's look
[1:21:04] at the saved or the righteous or the
[1:21:05] foolish virgin we call them all those
[1:21:07] those are just different names for the
[1:21:09] same group of people now this was
[1:21:12] encouraging as you probably remember
[1:21:13] this Jesus speaks to the foolish virgin
[1:21:16] and the King says unto them on his right
[1:21:18] hand come you blessed of my father
[1:21:20] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[1:21:22] from the foundation of the world see
[1:21:26] this proves the foolish virgin was
[1:21:28] foreknown before the foundation of the
[1:21:31] world because God knew which names would
[1:21:33] remain on the book of life amen
[1:21:36] hallelujah so you must remember that
[1:21:39] remember jesus said a very similar thing
[1:21:42] to the bride right who had the five
[1:21:44] counts well done good and faithful
[1:21:45] servant enter into the joys of the Lord
[1:21:48] prepared for you from the foundation of
[1:21:50] the world he says a very similar thing
[1:21:52] see because both their names remain on
[1:21:56] the book of life the bride is the Lamb's
[1:21:58] Book of Life
[1:21:59] the foolish version is the book of life
[1:22:03] but the Prophet says after that there'll
[1:22:06] be disappointments and surprises at the
[1:22:08] judgment Satan's Eden the Prophet says
[1:22:12] again it's religious sin as at the
[1:22:14] beginning so deceitful watch it now it's
[1:22:16] not just purely every old everyday sin
[1:22:19] committing adultery and getting drunk
[1:22:20] and using God's name in vain that's not
[1:22:21] it so we're not going to actually look
[1:22:24] for that today right that's not really
[1:22:27] deceptive
[1:22:28] someone's committing adultery or getting
[1:22:30] drunk or cussing that's not a surprise
[1:22:32] that's we know that sin right but Satan
[1:22:35] is more deceptive than that he said you
[1:22:37] remember years ago many of you hear the
[1:22:39] old timers remember that sermon I
[1:22:40] preached on the disappointment that the
[1:22:42] judgment the heart at she ain't gonna be
[1:22:43] disappointed there she knows where she's
[1:22:45] going
[1:22:46] the drunkard ain't gonna be disappointed
[1:22:47] there the bootlegger gambler the liar
[1:22:49] the thief he's not going to be
[1:22:51] disappointed because they know they
[1:22:53] stole from God they lied to God they
[1:22:55] lied the guy of God's people
[1:22:57] I brought I brought drunk I gambled I
[1:23:01] know I should not have gambled I should
[1:23:03] not have trusted management trusting God
[1:23:05] but it's the man who thinks he's right
[1:23:07] there's the disappointment that's what
[1:23:11] the fellow said come haven't I preached
[1:23:13] the gospel but not cast out Devils in
[1:23:14] their name so he goes back to Matthew
[1:23:16] 7:21 Lord have we not done this and
[1:23:19] Jesus said you didn't do the will of my
[1:23:20] father see their efforts were in the
[1:23:23] right channel the efforts of the
[1:23:25] believer must be in the right channel
[1:23:26] right we must have the right effort in
[1:23:30] the right channel now I just want to
[1:23:33] note this remember all people still have
[1:23:35] their human spirits and souls at the
[1:23:37] white throne judgment they all have
[1:23:40] their human spirits because some of them
[1:23:42] have a state of surprise and then others
[1:23:46] ask Jesus questions see so they still
[1:23:49] have a human spirit they're able to ask
[1:23:51] Jesus questions because remember the
[1:23:53] righteous who are say the foolish
[1:23:54] version they're like when did I do
[1:23:55] anything good deal Lord see they're
[1:23:57] asking questions they're trying to
[1:23:58] understand they have to have a human
[1:24:00] spirit to do that
[1:24:01] remember the souls under the altar the
[1:24:03] Jews they said Lord how long will it be
[1:24:07] to revenge our blood and they're asking
[1:24:09] for something that's not good revenge is
[1:24:11] not anything for man its revenge is for
[1:24:12] God so see their reasoning and their
[1:24:15] their thoughts aren't the right way in
[1:24:17] the rich man and Lazarus member they're
[1:24:18] both reasoning down there in hell we'd
[1:24:21] say in the prison house their reasoning
[1:24:24] they've already died but they still have
[1:24:26] their human spirits and souls and
[1:24:28] they're able to ask Jesus questions and
[1:24:35] here's where we
[1:24:37] generations and individuals we judge by
[1:24:39] their works at the light throne judgment
[1:24:42] God will call every generation forth and
[1:24:45] then the generation want to answer and
[1:24:48] then individuals will have to answer as
[1:24:50] well and brother Bram said for those who
[1:24:52] are lost which we know the Scriptures
[1:24:53] Jesus said this as well for every
[1:24:56] individual the prophets said the rising
[1:24:59] up of every warning will come upon the
[1:25:03] individual so somehow God will replay
[1:25:07] every warning God sent to that
[1:25:08] individual you had a chance here you had
[1:25:10] a chance here Church let's take every
[1:25:12] chance we had to get right with God
[1:25:14] every warning will rise up against those
[1:25:17] who just turned the warning away well I
[1:25:18] should have did this I did it I should
[1:25:20] have did he's gonna bring up every time
[1:25:22] he gave us a warning God have mercy to
[1:25:24] hear the voice of the Holy Spirit to
[1:25:27] take heed to warning because it's true
[1:25:31] the Bible said they'll be judged out of
[1:25:34] those things written the books corta
[1:25:36] their works they were judged every man
[1:25:38] according to their works God will bring
[1:25:40] up every time a warning came up but yet
[1:25:42] they chose this work well I'll do this
[1:25:44] work instead of that work let's choose
[1:25:46] God's works God's works or eternal the
[1:25:49] works of man will are frivolous they'll
[1:25:52] fail the Bible said they're judged by
[1:25:55] their works they chose to do this work
[1:25:57] instead of doing what God warned them
[1:25:58] not to do here's where he says in Elijah
[1:26:02] 1953 you see a man a young man here this
[1:26:05] week and look back and look it looked
[1:26:07] like it hasn't been no time and there he
[1:26:10] is broke down his hairs returning grace
[1:26:11] let's see how that or how fast time goes
[1:26:13] and the beautiful young woman she's
[1:26:17] withering away that's a warning
[1:26:20] so she withering away getting older gray
[1:26:22] hair it's a warning the Prophet said
[1:26:24] prepare to meet God yes sir and
[1:26:28] everything that's pointing you to that
[1:26:30] will witness against you at the day of
[1:26:33] judgment I forgot to highlight
[1:26:34] everything let's all say everything
[1:26:36] ready everything the gray hairs the
[1:26:38] witness the withering away getting old
[1:26:41] all these are witnesses we've got to
[1:26:42] answer some day when I come to the end
[1:26:47] of the road and you come to the end of
[1:26:48] the road when we get there God is
[1:26:50] to make everything here listen the trees
[1:26:53] how trees die and come back God's gonna
[1:26:56] use trees to witness against people
[1:26:59] everything is going to make every
[1:27:01] warning be rising up in judgment against
[1:27:04] those who are lost God's gonna use the
[1:27:07] trees he's gonna use the storms all
[1:27:09] these mass shootings gonna use
[1:27:10] everything everything that's a warning
[1:27:13] God's gonna bring all I tried to warn
[1:27:15] you here I tried to warn you here I
[1:27:16] tried to warn you here god help us to
[1:27:18] listen to the Holy Spirit now look at
[1:27:20] this he'll call up now let me get back
[1:27:23] to this quote I'm gonna jump back here
[1:27:25] let's go to Jesus words here yes the men
[1:27:30] of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with
[1:27:33] this generation the member this is all
[1:27:36] everybody you have the bride behind the
[1:27:38] throne you have Jesus on the throne
[1:27:39] you have the bride back here the Old
[1:27:40] Testament Saints back here and then out
[1:27:44] there you have all the people from every
[1:27:45] generation and Jesus said the men of
[1:27:48] Nineveh will rise in judgment so see
[1:27:51] every warning will rise against the
[1:27:52] person who rejected it
[1:27:53] and shall condemn it because they
[1:27:57] repented at the preaching of Jonas and
[1:27:59] behold a greater than Jonas is here hey
[1:28:02] man
[1:28:02] and not only will the men of Nineveh
[1:28:05] rise but God gives every word with two
[1:28:08] or three witnesses hey glory now Louie
[1:28:11] does he raise up Nineveh he raises up
[1:28:15] the Queen of the South which was a
[1:28:17] thousand years before Christ the queen
[1:28:23] of the showers South shall rise up in
[1:28:25] the judge with this generation and shall
[1:28:26] condemn it for she came from the
[1:28:29] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[1:28:31] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[1:28:34] than Solomon is here now look at Church
[1:28:37] the only gift she came for was wisdom
[1:28:40] glory
[1:28:41] it wasn't tongues it wasn't miracles it
[1:28:44] wasn't bait it was just a gift of wisdom
[1:28:46] and God is going to make all the people
[1:28:49] jeez they answer because they left
[1:28:51] everything they had to support one gift
[1:28:54] of wisdom what about us today hey man
[1:28:56] we've got the fivefold ministry or we've
[1:28:58] got to give them healing or get their
[1:29:00] tongue in the congregation but we've got
[1:29:02] to invest in that we've got to put
[1:29:03] effort into
[1:29:04] if not God's gonna make those answer who
[1:29:07] don't invest in the gifts amen so can
[1:29:14] you imagine let's skip all the Old
[1:29:15] Testament and Jesus will start he'll
[1:29:19] start with the generation the generation
[1:29:20] that was on the earth we'd say 100 BC to
[1:29:24] 100 AD that generation must rise and
[1:29:29] then Jesus would say open the books to
[1:29:31] this generation that the Bible wrote
[1:29:33] about Matthew Mark Luke and John open
[1:29:36] the books and judge their works and
[1:29:39] they're gonna shout out and and they'll
[1:29:41] shout out things that they'll make up
[1:29:43] excuses well I I couldn't I couldn't
[1:29:47] leave you know the Sanhedrin because I
[1:29:50] would have lost my money like people
[1:29:53] today I couldn't leave my job because
[1:29:55] the money are couldn't forsake my family
[1:29:57] and follow the message because of my
[1:29:59] family and the church said well this was
[1:30:03] said here look at this
[1:30:04] I'm sorry he said even the crimes of the
[1:30:07] wicked will condemn you he says when the
[1:30:09] cries of the wicked that is in hell when
[1:30:11] you stand there and say well I didn't I
[1:30:13] meant to do right Lord he said but there
[1:30:16] will be millions of them in Hell saying
[1:30:18] you have to condemn him because I had
[1:30:20] the same intention and you sent me down
[1:30:23] here you're not just God if you let them
[1:30:26] get by with it hey man so that
[1:30:29] generation will rise Caiaphas will stand
[1:30:31] there man
[1:30:32] all these Sanhedrin all these Jewish
[1:30:35] people stand there and have to answer
[1:30:38] they'll make excuses well I couldn't
[1:30:39] give this I couldn't give up that and
[1:30:41] and I meant to follow the message I
[1:30:44] meant to do better
[1:30:45] I meant to try a little harder but those
[1:30:47] voices arise up many million voices said
[1:30:49] we had the same intentions it's not
[1:30:52] about intentions it's what you feel led
[1:30:54] to do praise God it's the actual fruit
[1:30:56] that comes out of your life and the
[1:30:58] church said glory
[1:30:59] it's the fruits that come out of your
[1:31:01] life that's what matters the Pharisees
[1:31:05] had corrupt fruit because they were
[1:31:06] Crupp seed praise God
[1:31:08] but the believer had fruit come out of
[1:31:11] their lives how many thankful were the
[1:31:12] fruit of the Spirit amen
[1:31:14] millions so those
[1:31:18] make excuses Caiaphas will say well I
[1:31:19] was the there was so much pressure I
[1:31:21] tried I couldn't I didn't mean to do
[1:31:24] this and they'll say you can't do that
[1:31:27] you can't let Kivus go in all these
[1:31:29] millions of voices you must be just and
[1:31:31] they'll say they'll say God is a just
[1:31:33] God and he'll see you say depart from me
[1:31:35] you that work iniquity I never need you
[1:31:38] Caiaphas I don't appreciate the word of
[1:31:42] the Lord
[1:31:44] they'll rise and if there's nobody in
[1:31:47] your day well that someone might from
[1:31:49] our day one Slayer to see it comes up I
[1:31:51] might say well you know I meant I meant
[1:31:55] to follow the message closer I meant I
[1:31:57] meant to do all these things I meant to
[1:31:59] do a little better but there was nobody
[1:32:01] you know nobody that I knew was no
[1:32:04] struggle like I did and God will raise
[1:32:06] up a witness there'll be a hand raised
[1:32:08] up on the sea of witnesses a hand raised
[1:32:10] up and God will rise that witness up and
[1:32:13] come up to the courtroom right rise up
[1:32:16] against God can pull back somebody from
[1:32:18] a thousand years
[1:32:19] God can go pull back somebody from five
[1:32:21] hundred years but God has a witness God
[1:32:24] has a witness in every age amen glory so
[1:32:28] we cannot make excuses because God will
[1:32:33] have every warning rise against us well
[1:32:36] you saw the trees you saw them lose
[1:32:38] their leaves every year you knew death
[1:32:41] was coming you knew this your hair's
[1:32:43] turned gray right you saw somebody else
[1:32:46] living it you should have filed their
[1:32:47] example and remember we know this jesus
[1:32:52] said another one that saith Lord Lord
[1:32:53] but he that doeth the will my father
[1:32:55] look what he says in Matthew 25 then he
[1:32:58] said them depart I'm sorry then he shall
[1:33:01] say unto them on the left hand depart
[1:33:02] from me he cursed an everlasting fire
[1:33:04] prepared for the devil and his angels
[1:33:06] for I was hungered and you gave me no
[1:33:08] meat I was thirsty and you gave me no
[1:33:10] drink our merciful God gives salvation
[1:33:15] by the simple act of kindness jesus said
[1:33:19] so by simple act of kindness these that
[1:33:24] are lost only have enough kindness to
[1:33:26] give a little bit of clothes to somebody
[1:33:27] I think about you who've you who've you
[1:33:30] and I huh plainly with clothes
[1:33:32] who we help with food now this is the
[1:33:34] foolish version will get saved for that
[1:33:36] and the foolish version gets saved for
[1:33:38] that how much more should we be helping
[1:33:39] out the poor is there anybody in prison
[1:33:45] you can go visit eternal life we know is
[1:33:48] living for others who are we helping our
[1:33:50] lives are here to help other people who
[1:33:53] are we helping with our money who we
[1:33:55] helping with food who are we helping
[1:33:57] with this we open with that that's what
[1:34:01] the fouché version does at least we
[1:34:04] should at least do that now I want you
[1:34:07] to this this this next slide goes back
[1:34:09] to that thought about Nineveh God is
[1:34:11] looking for respect for his gifts that's
[1:34:15] what God is looking for we must fully
[1:34:18] support the gifts God has placed in our
[1:34:20] area that's what it came down with the
[1:34:22] men of Jesus day they didn't support the
[1:34:25] ministry that God sent them see God God
[1:34:31] is going to do this respect to a lesser
[1:34:34] gift of God we'll witness against those
[1:34:35] who disrespected a greater gift
[1:34:38] solomon's ministry was on no level
[1:34:41] compared to Jesus Christ praise God
[1:34:43] Jonah's ministry was on no level to
[1:34:46] Jesus Christ not even close but because
[1:34:49] they respected Jonah they respected
[1:34:52] Solomon even though it's a lesser gift
[1:34:53] God gives them eternal life amen so we
[1:34:58] must respect the ministry that God sends
[1:35:00] to us we can't to determine the ministry
[1:35:04] God sent to us we just have to recognize
[1:35:06] where's God's ministry that he sent to
[1:35:08] us and we must back that with all we've
[1:35:10] got right cuz he's the same yesterday
[1:35:13] today and forever he'll always judge
[1:35:15] justly now this is one thing I brought
[1:35:18] out Wednesday I want to bring it out if
[1:35:20] he didn't hear it the foolish virgin was
[1:35:22] unaware that Christ was in the brethren
[1:35:25] they said when do we do anything good to
[1:35:28] you Jesus they didn't even know that
[1:35:29] Christ was living inside of the wise
[1:35:31] virgin
[1:35:32] they got so common to them praise the
[1:35:36] Lord the wise version were so common to
[1:35:38] the fourth virgin oh they're just you
[1:35:40] know that's just brother-sister so and
[1:35:42] so you know I just
[1:35:45] this proves a few things first it shows
[1:35:48] how foolish the foolish version truly is
[1:35:50] because she couldn't recognize a Holy
[1:35:52] Ghost filled life Jesus when did we see
[1:35:55] you we didn't even know you were in your
[1:35:57] people they didn't even know that I
[1:35:58] thought it was just about attending
[1:36:00] church I thought it was just about being
[1:36:01] a good person and Jesus gonna say I
[1:36:04] lived in them I was living in their
[1:36:07] lives and because you were good to them
[1:36:10] I'm giving you eternal life we can do a
[1:36:17] better job of serving one another here
[1:36:19] can't we
[1:36:21] Paul said be good especially to those of
[1:36:23] the household of faith we must be good
[1:36:28] to one another
[1:36:30] second it proves how humble the bride
[1:36:33] truly is because she never exalted
[1:36:35] herself she never stood there and said
[1:36:37] look at me I'm the wise virgins look at
[1:36:39] me the foolish virgin just was nice and
[1:36:42] they're giving eternal life see it's
[1:36:44] always God hiding himself in simplicity
[1:36:46] in the bride's simple spirit filled life
[1:36:50] the bride's life just just revolves
[1:36:53] around the Lord Jesus Christ they're
[1:36:55] filled with the spirit they're walking
[1:36:57] the truth but it's so humble people will
[1:37:01] miss it because it is so humble and
[1:37:04] remember every congregation will answer
[1:37:06] at the White Throne someone bring it
[1:37:07] back to us I like to do that from time
[1:37:09] to time now remember if you're in the
[1:37:14] bride though you'll stand there right
[1:37:16] with Jesus and then when the the foolish
[1:37:19] version is brought up or whatever to
[1:37:20] make the rapture and it comes to our age
[1:37:23] the generation of twenty twenty
[1:37:25] seventeen whatever generation we're in
[1:37:27] maybe two generations after the Prophet
[1:37:29] they'll call I don't know we will come
[1:37:32] up or those that aren't in the bride
[1:37:34] will come up to be judged and Paul said
[1:37:36] obey them that have the rule over you
[1:37:38] and submit yourselves for they must
[1:37:39] watch for your souls as they must give
[1:37:41] account that they may do it with joy not
[1:37:44] with grief for that is unprofitable for
[1:37:46] you so see they'll give joy if it's at
[1:37:49] the if their foolish virgin grief if
[1:37:51] it's if their lost
[1:37:52] think about all the churches the Prophet
[1:37:56] said you
[1:37:57] misbehavior of unconfessed sin of you
[1:37:59] believers can cause this church to
[1:38:00] bitterly fail and at the Day of Judgment
[1:38:02] you'll be responsible for every bit of
[1:38:03] it and the church said here's another
[1:38:07] one adoption well Graham said let us
[1:38:10] just read it and believe it the way it's
[1:38:11] written and especially we shepherds of
[1:38:13] the flocks we pastors who someday will
[1:38:16] gather yonder in that glorious land with
[1:38:18] the little flocks and will stand the
[1:38:22] presence of the Lord Jesus SR you're
[1:38:25] gonna stand with on that day church all
[1:38:28] of us will stand together this
[1:38:31] generation would come up and our church
[1:38:33] will stand there left to answer in our
[1:38:36] church bitterly fail or did our church
[1:38:38] succeed by the power of God and we'll
[1:38:43] see that generation come up upon a Peter
[1:38:45] and of Luke and a mark and Matthew know
[1:38:46] them and see them judge there with their
[1:38:49] groups we don't have to wonder well Who
[1:38:53] am I gonna be judged by right where we
[1:38:55] gonna be at we're gonna be right with
[1:38:56] our flocks right with our generation God
[1:39:01] grant that I can lay ten million
[1:39:03] trophies at your feet while I humbly
[1:39:04] crawl up my and lay my hands upon your
[1:39:07] precious feet and say Lord they are
[1:39:08] yours look at the humility there how
[1:39:18] many love the Lord today I'm happy to I
[1:39:22] want to I want to stand there with joy
[1:39:23] like all of you by God's grace but we've
[1:39:25] got to make the effort we've got to make
[1:39:28] the effort
[1:39:28] Branson you got a decision to make your
[1:39:30] Cadis you see it much you you see it
[1:39:33] stand much longer why why halt you
[1:39:35] between two opinions why isn't the
[1:39:37] church on fire why isn't this place
[1:39:39] packed out with people wise and great
[1:39:40] signs and wonders done don't lay it on
[1:39:42] the pastor he said it's you now I'm
[1:39:45] gonna say later it can be on the pastor
[1:39:47] like he's gonna say it later he's gonna
[1:39:48] say later I'm not saying I'm I'm the one
[1:39:51] who's not guilty or anything like that
[1:39:52] I'm just let's just read the quote he
[1:39:55] says we got a mixed multitude one point
[1:39:56] one way and one the other we got to come
[1:39:59] to a time a decision if it's the pastor
[1:40:01] there it is fire fire me if I'm if I'm
[1:40:05] keeping the church for meat on fire fire
[1:40:07] me
[1:40:09] right get him out of that and put
[1:40:11] somebody else in there who will take his
[1:40:13] place if it's a deacon take him off the
[1:40:15] board and put somebody else in his place
[1:40:17] that will take the place he said what
[1:40:19] are you gonna do brother God put the
[1:40:21] responsibility upon you our church and
[1:40:25] we've each one got to give an account
[1:40:28] for our own sins and answer at the day
[1:40:31] of judgment but see the bride that the
[1:40:33] bride won't have any condemnation
[1:40:35] because she's born again and God's
[1:40:37] Spirit has helped her confess all the
[1:40:39] sins now on this side amen so there is
[1:40:42] no surprise at the judgment Amen because
[1:40:45] everything is under the blood here
[1:40:46] Church everything says confess any
[1:40:50] questions any wonderings about how's
[1:40:51] this how's my relationship with that
[1:40:53] brother sister any questions are taken
[1:40:55] care of here and so they can be the
[1:40:58] Bride of Christ because there's no
[1:40:59] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:41:01] Jesus
[1:41:03] now let's stand because I got just a
[1:41:06] couple more quotes I mean I'm going back
[1:41:07] to this one here let's then so our names
[1:41:14] are going to be confessed and either the
[1:41:19] marriage supper of the lamb or the white
[1:41:22] throne judgment and the Prophet said
[1:41:27] well the Bible tells us we'll come up
[1:41:30] with our generation will come up with
[1:41:32] those that we associated with here in
[1:41:35] life and did we respect the ministry
[1:41:40] that God sent to us Solomon's age can it
[1:41:45] helps you know all's we got is to get
[1:41:47] the wisdom that's all right just support
[1:41:50] it maybe that's what you need support it
[1:41:52] with all that you got if they disrespect
[1:41:56] that ministry hear that I'm here with
[1:42:12] the spears edge of the church once more
[1:42:15] the Spirit has spoken
[1:42:17] I trust he spoke at the school once
[1:42:19] again we've reviewed the record of what
[1:42:21] the spirit said to another age and we
[1:42:23] have found the record correct another
[1:42:25] age has gone by and it was fulfilled
[1:42:27] exactly as he said it was easily what a
[1:42:29] consolation that is us I'm you're hoping
[1:42:37] to eat the last day I can say that
[1:42:40] because I know what hope I'm talking
[1:42:41] about
[1:42:41] I thought about just oh I'm talking
[1:42:44] about hope that comes because of what a
[1:42:51] conservationist is to the last a Gentile
[1:42:54] bride who's hoping to be in the rapture
[1:42:57] it causes our hearts to leap for joy
[1:43:00] that he's faithful and he Oh performance
[1:43:03] every promise if he was faithful and
[1:43:05] true to those of us are Asian age that
[1:43:08] he is just as true to this age if they
[1:43:12] by His grace and power they receded to
[1:43:14] condemn by head then solo eat but ask o
[1:43:17] therefore to perfection and meet the
[1:43:19] Lord in the air and forever be with him
[1:43:22] this is the hope of pretty maturity also
[1:43:31] we go through browser first tribulation
[1:43:33] will produce patience patience will
[1:43:36] produce experience experience produces
[1:43:38] the hope that I'll be there at the first
[1:43:42] resurrection I'll be there the first
[1:43:44] time he calls nate's I'll be there like
[1:43:47] that I love the more church I love you
[1:44:03] I just couldn't have a message for about
[1:44:06] two weeks
[1:44:16] morning today I hope everything is a
[1:44:20] warning place to get us
[1:44:28] the Bible says we warn everybody
[1:44:31] the first Thessalonians Shepherd 5
[1:44:33] whatever event everybody's warning for
[1:44:35] tiny words we all need warnings we all
[1:44:43] walk in the flesh at times don't walk in

[1:45:05] remember me privileges any father used
[1:45:09] to all the hands Lord I'm taking today's
[1:45:13] message as a blessing that has the
[1:45:15] spirit giving us our hope we must
[1:45:34] respect the ministry that you've sent
[1:45:36] and I'm talking about the entire Bible
[1:45:38] ministry we know some people may be
[1:45:42] battle with like an Avengers too much or
