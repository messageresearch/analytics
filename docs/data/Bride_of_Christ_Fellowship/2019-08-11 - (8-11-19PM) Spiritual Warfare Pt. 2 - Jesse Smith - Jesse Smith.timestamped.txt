[16:46] god bless the live streamers here God's
[16:48] grace god bless all the saints that
[16:50] showed up tonight by His grace happy to
[16:53] be in the house of more famous Asian
[17:10] chapter 6 verse 12 how this was such a
[17:17] good reminder this week I wasn't sure my
[17:27] little testimony how we prayed for that
[17:30] amen God given a good victory on the job
[17:31] so we're very grateful for that Lord
[17:35] really moved as we prayed so we thank
[17:38] the Lord for moving and that's the
[17:41] purpose behind this series just real
[17:42] briefly to look at the power of prayer
[17:45] for someone to children does have a good
[17:48] understanding of that as they grow up
[17:51] and remember this is the this is a
[17:53] ministry anybody can be called to every
[17:56] Christian is called this ministry so
[18:00] children when you feel burdened to pray
[18:01] for someone this is God calling you to
[18:05] be an intercessor visions six
[18:14] that's just our verse 10 finally my
[18:19] brethren be strong in the Lord and the
[18:21] power of his might but on the whole
[18:23] armor of God that you may both be able
[18:25] to stand against the wiles of the devil
[18:28] let's all reversible ready one two three
[18:34] blood but against principalities against
[18:38] powers against the rulers of the
[18:40] darkness of this world against spiritual
[18:43] wickedness in high places that one more
[18:46] word of Prayer father in heaven we thank
[18:48] you for this word Lord we bread it break
[18:50] it to us now Lord God teaches Lord thank
[18:53] you for answering one prayer request
[18:54] this week lord as we cried out to you
[18:56] Lord and prayed for you to intercede we
[18:59] thank you Lord and they continue to
[19:01] teach us Lord to battle for your glory
[19:04] in the spiritual warfare in Jesus Christ
[19:06] it sure said look at I want to look at
[19:22] these four forms of evil that we wrestle
[19:26] with last week I was looking at it and
[19:28] it looked kinda look like levels like
[19:31] hierarchy levels but as I studied it
[19:33] this week it didn't really seem like
[19:35] that we know there are hierarchy levels
[19:40] but it seems like seems like because all
[19:46] these if you notice all these are plural
[19:49] so we look at Lydia people Ephesians
[19:52] 6:12 or blessed for the banking systems
[19:56] anymore bless you bless you James and
[19:58] Lily praise the Lord last we got
[20:04] these were kind of like four levels but
[20:06] as I look at this later as I studied
[20:08] this weed I looked at the Greek it
[20:10] didn't really seem like that because
[20:12] principalities is plural powers is
[20:15] plural and rulers is plural so as I
[20:21] looked at that it didn't seem like it
[20:22] was four levels anymore we know there
[20:24] are levels though last we saw the Prince
[20:26] of Persia last week
[20:27] there's the Prince of Greece show so we
[20:30] saw that last week in Daniel 10 so over
[20:32] these kingdoms were demons so I believe
[20:36] there's a demon over the United States
[20:37] programs there's fear on every Church on
[20:39] every nation and of course churches - if
[20:42] you're not born again but we're born
[20:43] again Jarrett came and so the Holy
[20:45] Spirit old rusted the Holy Spirit I
[20:47] believe that but there's a spirit over
[20:49] Russia there's one demon that kind of
[20:51] rule over then he's got little demons
[20:53] under him controlling but as I look at
[20:57] this I would just rather say this is
[20:59] four forms of evil maybe not levels but
[21:03] we know there are levels so let's look
[21:07] at each one and then we will look at all
[21:09] these and some there's numerous
[21:10] scriptures now we'll look at and now I'm
[21:13] going to end with a few scriptures on
[21:14] prayer just to remember or to remind us
[21:17] of the power of prayer that we have so
[21:21] being out here a little testimony
[21:22] brother amen was having a real bad work
[21:23] situation so we went to special prayer
[21:25] on Monday and Tuesday I went to special
[21:27] prayer in a prayer closet he said he got
[21:29] the victory on Thursday so I just wanted
[21:32] to thank the Lord for that so it took a
[21:34] little extra prayer and it seemed like
[21:35] and I was wrestling in the prayer clause
[21:37] I just tried to have faith and speak
[21:40] against the evil you know just speak
[21:41] against that and evil and claim the
[21:43] victory and so the Lord brought the
[21:46] victory by Thursday so I think the Lord
[21:48] for that
[21:48] and I think that's why I think that you
[21:51] know sometimes God allows that to teach
[21:53] us the very reality of this scripture
[21:55] that we're not wrestling against you
[21:57] know people on the job we're not resting
[22:00] against family members who don't believe
[22:01] wrestling against spiritual powers that
[22:04] that they are letting control them right
[22:06] like we saw this morning with with Jesus
[22:09] speaking to Satan like Lydia and I were
[22:12] talking about Jesus said get behind me
[22:14] Satan but he was speaking to Peter but
[22:17] still I say
[22:17] was on his right shoulder you know what
[22:19] he's right behind him Jesus was not
[22:21] speaking really to Peter but the spirit
[22:23] that was on Peter we'd say above Peter
[22:26] if you know just want to look at it as a
[22:27] as a image in your mind so let's look at
[22:33] these here and there's so what I did as
[22:35] I looked at each scripture each Greek
[22:37] meaning and then trying to find the most
[22:39] important scriptures that use the same
[22:41] work now first wrestle wrestle and the
[22:44] Greek means a contest to throw the other
[22:48] and it says it was decided and the Greek
[22:52] it was decided you know you had wrestled
[22:54] one when you were able to hold down your
[22:56] opponent and put your hand up on his
[23:01] neck when you had him by the neck and he
[23:02] was down and couldn't breathe anymore
[23:04] it's like today they do martial arts on
[23:07] TV and when they choke him out sometimes
[23:09] they cut off their breathing and that's
[23:11] when they that's when they win the fight
[23:13] sometimes that's kind of like this
[23:15] wrestling in the Greek when they had
[23:17] somebody down by the throat and they
[23:19] said okay no more I can't breathe then
[23:21] you wrestled and you want at that point
[23:23] because you can't breathe anymore that's
[23:26] what this wrestling means and then in
[23:29] the spiritual its our struggle with the
[23:31] power of evil okay so it kind of deals
[23:35] with the neck and your air right and
[23:36] that's interesting too is that
[23:38] interesting it just struck me remember
[23:40] the four kinds of grounds the third one
[23:42] was like the foolish virgin remember it
[23:44] got choked out there is the there's the
[23:48] same type of thing so see that that's
[23:50] why that's why we need to be wise
[23:51] virgins so our prayer life doesn't get
[23:53] choked out so Satan doesn't defeat us
[23:58] but we defeat Satan we've got the rests
[24:01] on the piece Satan by prayer and that's
[24:03] the only way we're going to overcome so
[24:05] children I want you to know that as you
[24:06] grow older the only way you're over
[24:08] covers from prayer you've got to pray I
[24:11] know mommy spent significant time pray I
[24:13] spent significant time pray every
[24:16] Christian should start your day or
[24:18] sometime early the morning started with
[24:20] prayer that's how you're going to get
[24:22] the victory because that's what you're
[24:23] wrestling your rest against all the
[24:25] spirits remember remember God told Cain
[24:29] he said if you do well great
[24:31] but if not what's laying at your door
[24:33] sin so as soon as Cain left the house
[24:36] was right there even powers ready there
[24:39] to battle him right now we know they can
[24:41] be in the house as well but God just
[24:43] gave that example if you don't obey the
[24:45] Word of God you're gonna open your door
[24:48] up to demons open your life up to demons
[24:51] okay so that's what we have to remember
[24:54] children as you get older you're gonna
[24:56] overcome through prayer wrestling that's
[24:59] kind of like when I was praying for a
[25:00] man I was just praying on my knees just
[25:02] I was speaking against the spiritual
[25:05] powers how we're working at his job okay
[25:08] any sick person I prayed for I'm
[25:11] wrestling against it right we've been
[25:13] listening to brother Rams life story -
[25:15] you just have to keep praying and rebuke
[25:17] the demon spirits and pretty soon they
[25:19] would leave so we have to remember that
[25:21] we got to keep trying we have to keep
[25:23] wrestling they have to do the wrestling
[25:24] match spiritually until we got Satan
[25:26] down by the neck then he then he goes
[25:30] because he's overpowered so there's
[25:32] power in prayer that's what we're
[25:34] praying for word from Jose as you pray
[25:36] this morning that God would give him the
[25:37] victory in his in his vision and also
[25:40] he's got pressure in his in his head so
[25:42] we need to keep praying for that and
[25:44] trust God to him the victory has been
[25:47] wrestling against the spiritual powers
[25:49] all right now the word principalities
[25:52] here means the first place the rule or
[25:57] majus magister Cena says so the
[26:00] Principality the rules so these are the
[26:02] rulers so against the rulers now there's
[26:06] a few good scriptures I want to get to
[26:09] personally of all up 2nd Peter 2:19 how
[26:13] did Satan even get power of course we
[26:18] know God allowed him to have power but
[26:20] how did he get power here's how Satan
[26:23] really got the power from Adam while
[26:26] they promise them Liberty they
[26:28] themselves are the servants of
[26:29] corruption but here's where we're
[26:30] getting to for whom a man is overcome of
[26:33] the saying he has brought bondage why is
[26:37] man under Satan's principalities because
[26:41] Adam gave over his power when Adam
[26:45] power when he was under the anointing of
[26:46] the Holy Spirit before he said he had
[26:48] all the power he had all the dominion
[26:51] over the earth right but then when he
[26:53] saw his life of that condition he saw a
[26:56] hard condition he said well I don't want
[26:59] to lose her I love her she's a part of
[27:00] me so I willingly partake of the fruit
[27:03] I'll partake of that and so what he did
[27:05] he was overcome that by sin and because
[27:08] he forfeited that from the power
[27:10] dominion over the earth it went over to
[27:12] Satan the one who overpowered it one
[27:16] overpowered him as well so that's how
[27:19] Satan got this power of principalities
[27:21] over the earth that's why he's boomer
[27:24] over the earth
[27:25] now remember Saint already had we looked
[27:27] at last week
[27:28] Satan already had power in heaven right
[27:30] a little bit of power because he
[27:31] includes the third The Devil's in there
[27:34] the angels and other devils he was able
[27:36] to slander God or he'd say Christ or
[27:39] might call him one you instead don't
[27:41] leave Michael is Christ though he was
[27:43] able to slander you know the Archangel
[27:46] Michael and maybe God on his throne he
[27:48] was able to slander and deceive a third
[27:50] of them to following him and he had this
[27:54] power and so then when he was cast down
[27:57] to earth he was able to find a way in to
[27:59] get the power of man on the earth that's
[28:02] how he did it now here's a beautiful
[28:06] scripture romans 8 37 and 38 so keep
[28:14] this in mind there's nothing that can
[28:17] separate you from the love of Jesus
[28:19] Christ now keep it in mind for your lost
[28:21] loved ones right or that your friends
[28:23] aren't serving God and children they may
[28:25] seem like they're so far from the love
[28:27] of Christ but remember the scripture
[28:28] they and all these things we as
[28:31] believers are more than conquerors
[28:32] through him that loved us next scripture
[28:35] prime for suena neither death nor life
[28:37] nor Angels nor principalities so any
[28:42] high rulers any demons nor powers nor
[28:45] things present or things to come can
[28:47] separate us or shall separate us from
[28:50] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[28:52] our Lord amen so see there's no reason
[28:56] to fear any demon or any scary movie or
[28:59] any scary feeling that you have because
[29:01] there's nothing that can separate us
[29:03] from the love of Jesus Christ the love
[29:05] of the Cross is so powerful that no
[29:08] demon can keep you from it if you want
[29:10] God's love and if you want to be loved
[29:12] by God there's no demon that can stand
[29:14] in your way and keep you from it but
[29:16] never be able to hold you know to keep
[29:17] you from it you if you just say I'm
[29:19] coming in on repent God forgive me of
[29:23] all my sins that demon has to move right
[29:25] out of the way and you can't go right
[29:26] the threats of God amen
[29:28] it only takes four pets because it's
[29:30] repent and be baptized and you shall
[29:32] receive of the Holy Ghost
[29:34] I need even a slide all you have to do
[29:36] is say that will get behind me
[29:38] I repent God forgive me my sins I'm
[29:40] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ
[29:42] and there's God of you a Jesus is the
[29:44] way the truth of the life you knew you
[29:47] would be on the way to serve God amen
[29:50] that's just so keep that in mind that's
[29:52] beautiful
[29:54] now here's another come on let's go to
[29:56] Ephesians 1 verse 20 ephesians has a lot
[30:07] about this proceeding to 120 which he
[30:09] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[30:11] from the dead and set it at his own
[30:12] right hand in the heavenly places look
[30:15] at this is beautiful far above all
[30:17] principality there's that word remember
[30:20] we wrestled we're wrestling against
[30:21] principalities but where is Christ
[30:24] Christ is way far above that amen so see
[30:29] your prayers we may not be like each
[30:31] other but if we believe and we really
[30:33] trust God and we have no sin our lives
[30:35] our prayers go far above that layer of
[30:38] demon principalities everything with me
[30:41] because it basically the demon powers is
[30:43] the fifth dimension right because you
[30:45] have the third dimension is everything
[30:47] we see taste touch feel smell here the
[30:49] fourth dimension is the invisible you
[30:51] know Internet waves and TV waves and
[30:54] sound waves and all these things but the
[30:57] fifth dimension is that demonic
[30:58] dimension that's the Principality six
[31:01] dimension is the believers seventh
[31:03] dimension is a throne of God Revelation
[31:05] chapter four and five gives us great
[31:06] picture that so the Bible says God
[31:10] Christ is the seventh the
[31:12] dimension is far above the t-nut demonic
[31:15] dimension and our prayers go far above
[31:18] that amen hallelujah
[31:20] remember day you remember Daniel
[31:21] sprayers they went far above all those
[31:25] demon powers but the answer came down by
[31:27] an angel he came down that fifth
[31:29] dimension a wrestle three weeks and then
[31:31] Michael came it helped about have
[31:32] brought the ensign amen
[31:34] so we got to keep believing children
[31:36] keep praying because our our God is far
[31:40] above all that and then he can send out
[31:42] the health through this spiritual layer
[31:45] of demonic power
[31:46] he's far above all principality power
[31:49] Mike Dominion and every name that is
[31:51] named not only in this world but also
[31:53] and that which is to come amen
[31:55] children if you ever have any fear if
[31:57] you ever fear any spirit just speak the
[31:59] name is used to say the name of Jesus
[32:00] Christ because it's every day he's far
[32:04] above every name that's name whether
[32:06] it's fear whether it's discouragement
[32:08] whether it's depression whatever demon
[32:10] power you're feeling just speak the name
[32:12] of Jesus Christ and this far above any
[32:15] principality and he named it to be Nick
[32:17] praise God
[32:21] all right now so get a couple more here
[32:23] now before I move on here oh yeah let's
[32:30] watch this - 14 - 14 and the only bar
[32:34] that's me now here's what Christ did he
[32:42] blotted out the handwriting of
[32:43] Ordinances that was against us which was
[32:46] contrary to us and took it out of the
[32:50] way nailing it to his cross all right
[32:56] that's good patina and having spoiled
[33:00] principalities and powers he made a show
[33:03] of them openly triumphing over them in
[33:06] it what is good sure how they do you so
[33:12] jesus spoiled or robbed and remember how
[33:15] did that how did he rob honey spoiled
[33:17] principalities and powers he went down
[33:19] to the heart of the earth and took all
[33:21] the believers away from the heart of the
[33:23] earth
[33:23] it's how he spoiled it because spoiling
[33:25] is robbing out of Jesus Rob the devil
[33:28] but the devil had he had he had dominion
[33:32] over all the believers because they were
[33:33] under the blood of Jesus yet until he
[33:36] came in shed his blood so he come down
[33:38] there and we know he took the keys of
[33:39] death and hell you kicked over Satan's
[33:41] door right he spoiled all this all his
[33:44] believers he took all those believers
[33:46] and he also took the keys of death and
[33:48] hell and then he tried to over them when
[33:51] he walked on the earth and all those
[33:53] Saints were seen by people all over
[33:54] there
[33:55] it was a triumph amen there's a great
[33:57] parade and Jesus by his own blood
[33:59] and triumph over the enemy and he's
[34:02] showing the hopefully triumphing over
[34:05] them in it now I want to look at a few
[34:08] more scriptures let's go to book of John
[34:10] maybe I'll get there in just a minute
[34:12] let me put this truth yeah John 12:31
[34:18] now I don't know if this is exactly
[34:20] right but this is the way it seems like
[34:22] it is it's like Satan before them the
[34:26] bat I'm sorry before the crucifixion of
[34:28] Christ it's almost as if Satan had up
[34:31] had that list of ordinances against us
[34:34] it's almost like Satan had a list of
[34:35] complaints against us but then the Bible
[34:39] said Jesus nailed that to his cross so
[34:41] there was a spiritual nailing of those
[34:44] sins that we had to the cross because
[34:48] look at the look of Jesus says he know
[34:50] he doesn't get crucified - later I think
[34:52] a chapter 18 or 19 Jesus says now is the
[34:57] judgment of this world now shall the
[35:00] Prince of this world be cast out hey man
[35:03] so see the Prince of this world is Satan
[35:06] so somehow Jesus going to Calvary Satan
[35:10] would be cast out so almost as if we and
[35:15] this is the same time where the Bible
[35:17] said Jesus would crush or bruise the
[35:20] head of the serpent right but Jesus's he
[35:23] would be bruised so this is almost a
[35:27] casting out of Satan's power or the
[35:29] casting out of Satan's proof that he had
[35:32] power over us or maybe his his write to
[35:35] us right in
[35:37] Satan's right to keep Daniel in the
[35:38] heart of the earth Satan's right because
[35:41] the blood of bulls and goats never
[35:42] really forgave them right so he had a
[35:44] right to kind of keep them in the heart
[35:46] of the earth
[35:47] but when Jesus brought his own blood now
[35:49] the power of Satan was cast out amen and
[35:53] now these Saints can come right up to
[35:55] heaven amen that's beautiful to see that
[35:58] the Satan's power any power that he had
[36:01] to influence and try to accuse the
[36:03] Brethren was no longer there that power
[36:06] was cast out amen
[36:10] John go to John 16 11 there's another
[36:18] powerful scripture but not only is Satan
[36:21] and his accusations cast out which means
[36:24] it doesn't hold a place before God
[36:26] anymore
[36:27] now the Bible said that Satan's already
[36:31] judged a men of judgment because the
[36:35] prince of this world is judged praise
[36:38] God
[36:40] so see like the Bible said like the
[36:44] Bible said Jesus said in Moses and just
[36:47] as Moses lifted up the brass surf or the
[36:49] wilderness yeah so shall the Son of Man
[36:50] be lifted up as well and that brass
[36:52] serpent represent that sin was already
[36:54] judged in other words the payment for
[36:56] sin has been money paid amen so Satan is
[37:00] judged because all the all the wrath for
[37:03] sin has been paid amen it's argument
[37:06] baby Jesus took the penalty for sin so
[37:10] there's no more penalty for sin for the
[37:12] believer because jesus paid the price
[37:14] amen he prints the worldís cash now the
[37:18] prince of this world is judged
[37:20] that's why Jesus that's 1,000 Jesus is
[37:23] far above all principalities and powers
[37:25] than men because he's already cast out
[37:29] all his accusations against the believer
[37:35] his claim on people on the Old Testament
[37:39] Saints and those Saints who were yet
[37:41] under the blood Jesus Christ Jesus Jesus
[37:44] but paying the price and the Prince of
[37:47] this world is judged a mentum yeah
[37:50] there's a great
[37:51] change right there's a great change that
[37:53] happened in Calgary the transition from
[37:57] the Old Testament the New Testament
[37:59] remember the veil kept everybody on the
[38:02] Friends of God now we go right the
[38:04] prints of God they had nothing can keep
[38:06] us out it's not just one man once a year
[38:08] the high priest but now that Satan's
[38:11] medicines been judged and since been
[38:13] paid for and now the believer by
[38:15] repentance can go right the presence of
[38:17] God amen the windows of heaven are open
[38:19] they men hallelujah we just got a heap
[38:22] Ranger children we got to keep praying
[38:25] and keep wrestling against these
[38:27] spiritual wickedness and not give up
[38:28] that's what Satan wants us in he wants
[38:30] us to give up but we can't give up we
[38:33] got to keep offering prayer and keep
[38:34] wrestling until we can get the
[38:37] stranglehold on the devil praise God
[38:39] amen yeah that's right now let's go to
[38:43] the next one so that was principalities
[38:45] now powers the powers means one who
[38:51] possesses authority or a ruler someone
[38:56] who is the leading or more powerful one
[38:58] created beings superior so here we see
[39:04] we have to wrestle against Satan's
[39:05] authority or anyone who has power over
[39:09] someone else we have to be able to
[39:11] wrestle against them so let's look at a
[39:14] few scriptures of this year
[39:21] wrestle against principalities and
[39:24] powers so let's look at a few parts go
[39:28] to Luke 4 5 Luke 4 5 this is Jesus
[39:40] temptation we look at this this morning
[39:41] a little bit and the devil taking him
[39:45] into an high mountain showed him all the
[39:46] kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[39:49] time and he said to him all this power
[39:52] would I give thee and the glory of them
[39:55] for that is delivered unto me and who
[39:57] saw her I will give it if therefore thou
[40:01] will worship me all shall be thine
[40:05] now we see here we wrestle against the
[40:09] power so we wrestle against you go back
[40:11] to verse four
[40:14] I'm sorry verse five Luke four or five
[40:16] the kingdoms of this world
[40:19] so the kingdoms of the world are
[40:20] governed by powers and Satan has the
[40:24] power of them and he gives them to
[40:26] whomsoever he will right
[40:28] shaking decides I would eat it off I
[40:30] hate to say but perhaps Satan allowed
[40:32] trump to be elected is that's what it
[40:34] seems like which many of these
[40:35] presidents but but what God can do
[40:38] though God though can cut down and he
[40:41] God can annoy unbeliever and still use
[40:44] him right yeah just like Cyrus God came
[40:46] down and called Cyrus my servants Cyrus
[40:49] was a Ethan king but God anointed him to
[40:52] do good to Israel
[40:54] look at God's be able to no trouble to
[40:56] do good for Israel like all the previous
[40:58] presence had not done that I'm not a big
[41:01] Trump fan I mean I pray for a soul
[41:03] that's what we pray for Obama so pray
[41:04] for all them but this is the power that
[41:07] we have to wrestle against the power has
[41:09] over the United States government
[41:11] because that's the authority of power
[41:13] and authority that the scripture is
[41:15] talking about so the same word power is
[41:21] used the powers of the kingdoms of this
[41:23] world okay so let's look at maybe one or
[41:28] two more here yeah here's the same power
[41:37] vote up revelation 13:2 that if you
[41:39] could hunt
[41:43] so I like I like how God does it God
[41:46] allows Satan to have control over all
[41:48] these demons whatever you know that God
[41:49] will say you know what I'm gonna move
[41:51] this God in my purpose I'm gonna noise
[41:53] Cyrus and to be good to my people Israel
[41:56] I'm annoyed I'm an anointed Trump to be
[41:59] good to my people Israel that's what he
[42:01] did that's what it seems like so every
[42:04] now and then God will intervene to bring
[42:07] about prophecy to bring about his will
[42:09] look at revelation 13:2 here's this
[42:13] power and authority is the same word
[42:15] here now you know this is Imperial Rome
[42:19] from right around the turn of the last
[42:24] millennium and the Beast which I saw was
[42:27] like unto a leopard and his feet were as
[42:29] the feet of a bear in his mouth as the
[42:31] mouth of a life this is the Roman Empire
[42:34] and the dragon gave him his power and
[42:37] his seat and great Authority so it was
[42:40] Satan
[42:41] giving Rome their pot his power and
[42:44] authority right so this is what we've
[42:47] got to wrestle against you have to be
[42:50] able to wrestle against these spiritual
[42:51] powers that are over the United States
[42:55] government and more other governments
[42:57] like when we pray for people like an
[43:00] Iran or the Saints in the Philippines or
[43:02] anyone being persecuted well we need to
[43:05] realize that we can actually pray and
[43:07] try to influence the powers over that
[43:10] country we need to try and do that and
[43:13] perhaps it's in the will of God to do it
[43:15] not always I think God's what it do it
[43:17] but there are times where God does do it
[43:19] let's look at one where you can clearly
[43:22] see this so go to Acts chapter 12 X 12 1
[43:31] up try to try to understand especially
[43:33] the church I hope you can catch this dog
[43:35] here God doesn't always hear the prayers
[43:39] you know to overcome these kingdoms but
[43:41] there are times he does and this is kind
[43:44] of a little bit limit personal I'd say
[43:49] personal but it's just kind of I guess
[43:52] sad in one way but in other way we can
[43:54] see the power of God now
[43:56] verse 12 verse 1 12:1 now about that
[43:59] time Herod the King stretched forth his
[44:01] hands to vex earth of the church and he
[44:03] killed James the brother of John with
[44:05] the sword this is Harry God allowed
[44:09] Herod to arrest James who wrote the book
[44:12] of James and he was a martyr there in
[44:14] the early church now God never
[44:17] intervened to stop that God allowed
[44:19] James to be a martyr right
[44:21] look at verse 3 and because he saw it
[44:24] pleased the Jews he proceeded further to
[44:26] take Peter also then were the days of
[44:29] unleavened bread and we need apprehended
[44:31] and he put him in prison and delivered
[44:32] him to four courtiers nyrians of the
[44:35] soldiers to keep him intending after
[44:37] Easter to bring him forth to the people
[44:40] Peter therefore was kept in prison but
[44:42] prayer was made without ceasing of the
[44:44] church unto God for him and when Herod
[44:47] would have brought aboard the same night
[44:49] Peter receiving between two soldiers
[44:51] Muhammad two chains and the keepers
[44:53] before the door kept the prison behold
[44:56] the angel Lord came upon him and a light
[44:58] shined the prison and he spoke Peter on
[45:00] the side and raised him up saying arise
[45:02] up quickly and his chains fell off from
[45:05] his hands praise God look here's one
[45:08] where where no doubt the church was
[45:10] praying for James as well they were
[45:12] praying for James but God allowed him to
[45:15] go home
[45:15] but now the church cries out to God said
[45:18] god minister to Peter st. Peter so this
[45:22] time God does hear the prayers the
[45:25] prayers go up above all the
[45:26] principalities of Rome praise God they
[45:30] go above the principalities of Rome than
[45:32] God sends out an angel other this angel
[45:35] broke through those spiritual powers
[45:36] really max didn't he because Peter was
[45:40] in a maximum prison right maximum
[45:43] security this guy's such a bad guy the
[45:46] eyes of hair he's got he's got to sleep
[45:48] by two soldiers that's max from security
[45:51] he's not even in isolation he's got two
[45:54] prisoners right next to him he's got
[45:56] guys sleeping on both the shoulders but
[45:58] God God so moves upon the prayers of the
[46:02] Saints that he sends down the angel
[46:04] right for that fifth dimension comes
[46:06] right through those inner powers smites
[46:09] Peter said
[46:10] I sell quickly we got to get out of here
[46:12] amen
[46:13] let me ask you who had more power their
[46:16] new role or did the church have more
[46:18] power the church but the church will
[46:22] only see the results when it's the will
[46:24] of God everybody understand that but
[46:27] should we should should we what should
[46:29] we do should we give up on prayers we
[46:32] pray every time somebody gets arrested
[46:34] pray every time somebody gets arrested
[46:36] and then if it's God's will God will
[46:38] bring the man out if not then don't go
[46:40] home and their heavenly reward he's got
[46:43] that beautiful who's more powerful that
[46:46] Rome or the church who's more powerful
[46:50] today the United States government or
[46:52] this church our church if we're truly
[46:56] the Church of God under the blood of
[46:58] Jesus Christ then our prayers are more
[47:00] powerful see we're of a different
[47:02] Kingdom but we have to pray for the will
[47:04] of God to be done praise God
[47:07] hey man now go to John 19 10 this says
[47:11] it beautifully right here and this is
[47:16] the same thing there 4x chapter 12 then
[47:19] said Pilate unto him speakers down not
[47:21] unto me Jesus was keeping silent like a
[47:23] lamb at this point the worst now now
[47:25] that I power and crucify their power to
[47:27] release thing notice what Jesus says
[47:30] jesus answered thou goodness have no
[47:33] power at all against me except it were
[47:37] given thee from above amen
[47:40] what uh what uh what uh for the
[47:43] consolation what a confidence we haven't
[47:46] got no government can hurt us no police
[47:49] can arrest us nobody can kill us unless
[47:51] it would be God's Widow unless God would
[47:54] allow in other words we are in the hand
[47:56] of God our entire life is in the hand of
[47:58] God if anything would happen to us it
[48:00] would have to be God that would allow it
[48:02] and we know still even if God allows
[48:05] danger to happen to us there's nothing
[48:07] that could separate us from the love of
[48:09] Christ amen Alleluia thank you lord
[48:15] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[48:17] hath the greater sin see there's levels
[48:21] of sin you know that there's levels of
[48:23] sins
[48:24] than others I want you to see that power
[48:27] I've could have no power at all you have
[48:30] no authority over me except my father
[48:33] allowed it mm-hmm so see everything that
[48:36] happens to us has to be allowed by God
[48:39] praise the Lord
[48:44] okay now let's let's go to this one to
[48:49] refers to the end 6:12 now this is the
[48:53] scripture I used to overcome tobacco and
[48:56] other sins I just kind of quoted this
[48:58] scripture right in the scripture many
[49:00] many years ago
[49:02] notice the washing comes by the blood
[49:05] and the Holy Spirit verse 11 and such
[49:07] were some of you here wash your
[49:09] sanctified your justified the name of
[49:11] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[49:13] so immerse you got to get washed that
[49:15] verse 12 says all things are lawful unto
[49:17] me but all things are not expedient all
[49:20] things are lawful for me but I will not
[49:22] be brought under the power of any Amen
[49:27] Lucy because because they look at our
[49:29] lives that's why we go to church what
[49:31] power is ruling me what Authority is
[49:35] ruling me even in our house right in our
[49:38] house what's what's moving you you know
[49:41] what's moving each of the children of
[49:43] the adults and banging on we're leaders
[49:45] in our home what authority is moving us
[49:48] what do we obey are we obeying the
[49:50] powers of darkness or the powers of
[49:52] Christ's crew obeying the powers of
[49:53] Christ amen if not you be under you'd be
[49:57] under the influence of demons demon TV
[50:01] shows demon movies right see but we are
[50:05] under the power of Christ and then we
[50:08] have the we have the desire I'm not
[50:10] going to be brought under the power of
[50:12] any except God Almighty praise the Lord
[50:19] so that's a good scripture for that so
[50:22] you can see that that we have to live to
[50:24] look at our lives and say what is moving
[50:26] my life is it the power of God or is it
[50:30] the power of darkness
[50:39] now let's go to Luke 4 again we were
[50:42] there twice this morning let's go for 32
[50:50] and in sugar this is where you're gonna
[50:53] see we've been preaching on this lately
[50:55] the power of the spoken word here's how
[50:59] you have power over wickedness look at
[51:01] the Bible said and they were astonished
[51:03] at Jesus's doctrine for His Word was
[51:07] with power
[51:09] so Jesus would speak the word and the
[51:12] devil's move see I had an experience
[51:16] that my life Luud with my addictions I
[51:17] had to speak against the addiction until
[51:19] they finally left you got a you speaking
[51:22] so if you children want to see more
[51:24] victory in your lives you want to see
[51:25] victory for Adam you're gonna see
[51:27] victory for other Benjamin Austin these
[51:31] things we got to speak the Word of God
[51:33] and ask God to do it in prayer we have
[51:36] to ask him I'm good to make our request
[51:38] they don't have to God
[51:39] let's see your friends safe you got that
[51:42] speak it because the word is with power
[51:44] there's power in the Word of God okay
[51:48] and then if God does it praise the Lord
[51:50] if not then we know it's a time or
[51:52] season we have to wait for the time or
[51:54] season or perhaps it's not God's will to
[51:56] save them but we do have we do what to
[51:58] ask right we do want to be burden for
[52:02] people to be saved all right so it's
[52:05] always by the word of power we have to
[52:08] speak that word okay now let's look at
[52:13] another here actually we'll just move on
[52:19] the next one let's go to rulers let me
[52:20] go back to Ephesians 6:12 those
[52:23] scriptures are very similar so let's go
[52:25] back of course we know what the Word of
[52:27] God Jesus spoke the demons right there
[52:29] in people's lives and they moved out I
[52:31] think I told this testimony of a few
[52:33] months ago we had two people sitting on
[52:36] this side of the church like right in
[52:38] this row right here - there's two people
[52:41] on the side and they both came up for
[52:43] prayer dinner service saying that demons
[52:45] were
[52:46] trying to tempt them to leave the church
[52:47] and do evil things while I'm preaching
[52:50] demons are in this building but they
[52:55] both got the victory by the blood of
[52:57] Christ by coming up for prayer by
[53:01] resisting the devil so I want the tutor
[53:04] know that these are real things now the
[53:06] Spirit of Christ protects us right it's
[53:09] a hedge about us but there are times we
[53:11] get tested and God may pull back that
[53:13] heads a little bit to see if we'll
[53:15] overcome he wants to test us right to
[53:18] make sure we'll pass the test I want you
[53:20] to know that that that though there's
[53:23] voices going on there there's a battle
[53:24] going on even now praise God and we've
[53:27] got to believe and we've got to speak
[53:30] the Word of God and know that we've got
[53:31] power the blood of Christ our word has
[53:35] power amen that's why you don't have to
[53:39] even have need pray you can just pump
[53:41] the altar and just as your bread you
[53:43] just speak against whatever is tempting
[53:44] you come against depression I need
[53:48] depression the name of Jesus whatever
[53:49] whatever Satan's trying to battle you
[53:51] with you got power because you got the
[53:54] Word of God that's right
[53:56] and you have to refuse him and keep
[53:59] wrestling against him and choke him out
[54:00] so he has no more influence so he leaves
[54:03] you resist him and no fleet praise God
[54:06] amen so thou rulers of the darkness of
[54:10] this world I showed you two rulers last
[54:13] week the Prince of Persia and the Prince
[54:16] of Greece of Princeton Greece and they
[54:19] both battled angels two for in order to
[54:23] stop prayers being answered to God here
[54:28] every prayer though yes he did
[54:30] does God hear every one of your prayers
[54:31] yes he does but there are times and he
[54:34] won't he lets us know the Angels bowed
[54:37] out until he answers it praise God
[54:41] so these are rulers of the darkness of
[54:44] this world that's what wrestling against
[54:46] Peter and the church wasn't wrestling
[54:48] against Herod their runs against the
[54:50] powers above here
[54:52] mara what happened to Herod never happen
[54:55] next well right after that after Peter
[54:58] got out whatever what happened he
[54:59] I made a speech and they said oh he's
[55:01] like God and what happened God smote him
[55:03] right there and the worms ate of them
[55:05] from of that so see how bored it is that
[55:10] we remember like vengeance is the Lord's
[55:12] we're not they weren't rest against
[55:15] Herod the rest against the spirits that
[55:17] were influencing her and all we got to
[55:20] do is pray for God's prisoners or God's
[55:22] children to be set free and let God deal
[55:25] with the unbeliever praise God
[55:29] so that's our duty church is to pray
[55:32] against wrestle against the rulers of
[55:36] this world
[55:36] now the word ruler in the Greek means
[55:38] the lord of the world which is saying
[55:41] but this scripture says rulers of the
[55:43] darkness so we know it's not just
[55:44] speaking of Satan's become Satan and
[55:46] that higher demons the rulers of the
[55:49] darkness of this world and I'm just
[55:54] going to put this last one last one
[55:56] together here because I want to watch
[55:57] the time spiritual wickedness in high
[55:59] places
[56:00] this means the heavenly regions so we
[56:03] wrestled against rulers of the darkness
[56:05] of this world against spiritual
[56:07] wickedness in high places but he came up
[56:10] Ephesians 2:2 here visions tumors - okay
[56:20] now I want everybody to see this here
[56:26] we're in times past ye walked according
[56:28] to the course of this world according to
[56:31] the Prince of the power of the air so
[56:35] I'm glad children I'm glad you weren't
[56:38] here when I was a sinner if you would
[56:40] have saw me if you tur saw me I was
[56:42] walking according to the Prince and the
[56:44] power of the air I was living like every
[56:47] other sinner I wasn't being a good boy
[56:49] that was being a good teenager I was
[56:52] living a very simple life I was walking
[56:55] the course of the world I was only doing
[56:57] the things I wanted to do the spirit
[57:02] that now worketh in the children of
[57:04] disobedience so Satan is the Prince of
[57:10] the power of the air and then his spirit
[57:12] is
[57:13] Christ's spirit is what's working in
[57:16] people that disobey the Word of God so
[57:19] now you know your friends that haven't
[57:20] given their hearts to the Lord they're
[57:21] walking according to the Prince and
[57:23] power of the air when they disobey the
[57:27] word they haven't they have the spirit
[57:28] of disobedience so we've got to pray God
[57:34] help them to repent so they have
[57:36] obedience because right now there's
[57:39] spirits working up in their minds and
[57:42] controlling them to walk in disobedience
[57:45] to the Word of God and our prayers have
[57:48] to be lord help them to repent and walk
[57:51] under the sphere of obedience instead of
[57:54] a spirit of disobedience all right so
[57:58] this is scriptural this is what we're
[58:00] wrestling against spiritual wickedness
[58:02] in high places the spirit of
[58:05] disobedience in other words the spirit
[58:08] of rebellion they're under Satan's
[58:11] influence of the spirit of their day
[58:15] okay now let's finish with this I want
[58:22] to go through a few scriptures on prayer
[58:26] and then we'll be done maybe give you
[58:29] about 1500 soon okay let's go to 2nd
[58:38] chronicles 7 again we're in 10
[58:41] chronicles 20 earlier this morning
[58:43] service let's go to 2nd chronicles 7:14
[59:02] now this is Solomon praying and remember
[59:05] this morning we saw how Jehoshaphat he
[59:08] was surrounded by the Syrians and he had
[59:11] no choice of what it was what jobs that
[59:15] did was he recalled the prayer of
[59:16] Solomon and prayed he cried to God a
[59:20] prophet prophesied they received the
[59:23] word they started worshiping and during
[59:25] their worship God ambushed all the
[59:27] enemies so worship is a weapon now here
[59:34] some oven says this and this is a very
[59:36] familiar passage but let's just look at
[59:39] it and revisit it here let's go to verse
[59:45] 12 the Lord appeared to Solomon by night
[59:48] instead of him I have heard that prayer
[59:49] and I've chosen this place to myself for
[59:51] a house of sacrifice if I show up Evan
[59:54] that there be no rain or if I command or
[59:56] locusts to the bow the land where if I
[59:58] send vessels among my people if my
[1:00:00] people which are called by my name shall
[1:00:03] humble themselves and turn from their
[1:00:06] wicked ways sorry
[1:00:08] of themselves and pray and seek my face
[1:00:11] and turn from their wicked ways then I
[1:00:13] will hear from heaven and will forgive
[1:00:15] their sin and I will hear Oh heal their
[1:00:18] land now mine eyes shall be open in my
[1:00:22] ears attend under the prayer that is
[1:00:24] made in this place praise God
[1:00:27] now we as Christians should never be in
[1:00:31] a spot where we're so evil that God cuts
[1:00:35] off all the blessings from us in other
[1:00:38] words we should have lived like sinners
[1:00:39] we should be living the holy calling of
[1:00:42] God but I just want to bring this out
[1:00:45] because brogrammer mentioned this the
[1:00:47] scripture many times about the humility
[1:00:50] of Prayer if the Bible says in verse 14
[1:00:55] God's people that are gone guys they
[1:00:58] humble themselves and pray turn from
[1:01:01] their wicked ways then he'll hear from
[1:01:04] heaven forgive their sin and heal their
[1:01:06] length
[1:01:08] okay so there's a clear promise if my
[1:01:10] people humble themselves and cry out to
[1:01:12] God I will hear them and heal their land
[1:01:16] all right so we know though America's
[1:01:21] not gonna have a national revival and
[1:01:24] it's already that saith the Lord they
[1:01:25] won't so we've got to do is pray for
[1:01:29] small little revivals in other words we
[1:01:33] have to pray God send a revival to our
[1:01:36] little church yeah revive our church
[1:01:38] save all the souls in Akron because we
[1:01:42] know that all of Akron is going to be
[1:01:43] saved now all of Ohio is going to be
[1:01:46] saved but there there can be small
[1:01:49] pockets of revival right here in Akron
[1:01:53] now I don't know remember I told you
[1:01:55] this honey remember brother Steve
[1:01:56] Alexander that the deities of the sable
[1:01:58] guide talked I told her God needs to
[1:02:00] come to church I reach out to him and I
[1:02:03] remember he said I've been praying for a
[1:02:04] church in Akron since the 1990s he told
[1:02:07] me so he showed us such as say 1995 just
[1:02:11] middle of the decade in 1995 Steve
[1:02:14] Alexander starts praying for a church
[1:02:16] and after 95 2005-2006 11 years later
[1:02:22] God raised up a church in Akron
[1:02:25] and so but God has done is he started a
[1:02:28] revival right here in Akron and there's
[1:02:31] at least one person we know that was
[1:02:34] praying for a message Church in Akron
[1:02:36] and now God's done it amen
[1:02:39] faces are so see this is what God is
[1:02:42] doing just little revivals and the last
[1:02:45] cleaning there's there's a few stalls in
[1:02:48] Akron God wants us to glean those but if
[1:02:53] we want to see more save we have to
[1:02:54] continue to humble ourselves and pray
[1:02:56] and seek God's face you know I remember
[1:03:00] talking with brother James brownie
[1:03:01] before he passed away and I said brother
[1:03:05] you know did you guys because I like
[1:03:07] doing outreaches I might give you did
[1:03:08] the postcards last year and he said I
[1:03:11] said what about outreaches he said we
[1:03:12] never did outreaches like that he said
[1:03:14] we would just pray over the years for
[1:03:16] God to save souls and God would save
[1:03:18] souls
[1:03:20] so there in other words he to the same
[1:03:23] thing we're doing we're just praying God
[1:03:24] saves Souls and then God will send them
[1:03:28] in see we're praying against the
[1:03:30] spiritual wickedness that's over
[1:03:32] people's lives but we got to keep
[1:03:34] wrestling we can't give up we got to
[1:03:36] keep credit there he's God so we have to
[1:03:41] humble ourselves though and pray and you
[1:03:46] know I'm thinking about this I'm praying
[1:03:49] about maybe changing the order of
[1:03:50] service a little bit you know in the
[1:03:52] future months we'll see I would like to
[1:03:54] maybe start with a little more prayer
[1:03:55] time so I'm just I'm letting you know
[1:03:58] I'm praying about that if God would lead
[1:04:00] me to do that here's why
[1:04:02] you know Jesus says that in Mark 11 17
[1:04:06] is it not written my house should be
[1:04:09] called of All Nations in the House of
[1:04:10] Prayer so I feel like we should have
[1:04:13] more prayer time at church if people
[1:04:16] can't make it early to pray then maybe
[1:04:18] we should just pray more together in
[1:04:20] church and I'll try to short my sermons
[1:04:22] a little bit but as I've been studying
[1:04:24] prayer I've been seeing how this is so
[1:04:27] important I go to first Timothy 2 and a
[1:04:31] few more scriptures
[1:04:34] first Timothy 2 verse 1
[1:04:38] [Music]
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:51] first Timothy 2:1 I exhort therefore
[1:04:54] that first of all prayers which are
[1:04:57] supplications prayers intercessions and
[1:04:59] of giving thanks be made for all men as
[1:05:02] that beautiful almond so it is God's
[1:05:08] will God loves it when you children
[1:05:10] raise your hand for a prayer request
[1:05:12] right
[1:05:13] God loves that because that's what's
[1:05:15] supposed to be done we're supposed to
[1:05:16] give thanks we're supposed to intercede
[1:05:18] for all men and he says first of all so
[1:05:22] paul sartre the first of all i want to
[1:05:24] remind you we need to pray for everybody
[1:05:26] we need to pray verse 2 for kings so for
[1:05:32] us that be present
[1:05:33] and for all that are in authority so our
[1:05:36] Senators and Representatives and our
[1:05:37] governor our mayor that we may lead a
[1:05:41] quiet and peaceful life in all godliness
[1:05:42] and honesty mm-hmm praise the Lord
[1:05:47] a church when was the last time we
[1:05:49] prayed for the mayor of Akron I don't
[1:05:50] know if I ever have a right those last
[1:05:54] time we prayed for governor Mike DeWine
[1:05:56] from Ohio I remember maybe one bunch of
[1:06:00] twice but see I think myself even as a
[1:06:05] Christian and other Christians we just
[1:06:07] forget that we need to pray for these
[1:06:09] people and if we're not doing it at our
[1:06:13] homes that we've run into a reminder to
[1:06:14] do it here and then we'll take it to our
[1:06:16] homes you see Mike going time he prays
[1:06:19] around election time but we need to pray
[1:06:22] more than that meeting pray for that the
[1:06:24] Bible said first of all do this make
[1:06:26] prayer for all men verse 3 this is good
[1:06:31] and acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:06:33] Savior who will have all men to be saved
[1:06:35] that all who have that word hat means
[1:06:38] wishes who wishes all men to be saying
[1:06:41] and come to the knowledge of the truth
[1:06:44] verse 5 there's one God I want to eat
[1:06:47] mediator between God and men the man
[1:06:49] Christ Jesus did you catch that mediator
[1:06:52] we'd have to go through the mediator
[1:06:55] Jesus Christ its first ones that we have
[1:06:56] to make intercessions for all men so we
[1:07:00] are going to Jesus saying Jesus please
[1:07:02] intercede further as we said Benjamin
[1:07:04] Oster some of these we've been praying
[1:07:06] for Jesse's dead Justin's mom everyone's
[1:07:08] were praying for me to go to Jesus and
[1:07:11] say Jesus will you intercede on behalf
[1:07:12] of these people cuz you're the mediator
[1:07:18] verse 6 who gave himself a ransom for
[1:07:21] all to be testified in due time where do
[1:07:24] I learn ain't a preacher an apostle I
[1:07:26] speak the truth in Christ I lie not a
[1:07:29] teacher the Gentiles of faith emeriti I
[1:07:32] will therefore that then for anywhere
[1:07:34] everywhere just a church everywhere
[1:07:39] that's what I said well I can't remember
[1:07:41] the last time I prayed in my home for
[1:07:43] some of the leaders in the government
[1:07:44] you know Kepler
[1:07:45] maybe the president and students
[1:07:47] freeport the Bible said pray everywhere
[1:07:50] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[1:07:55] doubting so when we pray we need to be
[1:07:59] assured that God is going to hear our
[1:08:01] prayers because we want to lead a life
[1:08:07] of quiet and peaceable life in all
[1:08:09] godliness and honesty now let's look at
[1:08:17] two more scriptures before we finish
[1:08:18] here let's go to Romans 10:1 Romans 10:1
[1:08:28] brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[1:08:31] God for Israel is that they might be
[1:08:33] insane so this last one I want to bring
[1:08:36] out we should pray for Israel mm-hmm we
[1:08:40] should pray for Israel and remember they
[1:08:42] will be saved because the fist seal
[1:08:44] tells us that because their souls are
[1:08:46] the author they only have the testimony
[1:08:48] of the Word of God they don't have the
[1:08:49] testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:08:50] they don't have white robes yet which is
[1:08:52] eternal life so they cry out have
[1:08:55] vengeance but it will be when will we be
[1:08:58] avenged remember that but then the Bible
[1:09:02] says your brethren have to suffer a
[1:09:04] little while and then you'll be amazed
[1:09:08] right the Bible said white robes were
[1:09:10] given to them they didn't have eternal
[1:09:12] life on the earth so they got eternal
[1:09:14] life there in the sixth dimension there
[1:09:17] in heaven so see we got to pray for his
[1:09:20] role that God will save them I was
[1:09:22] watching a video yesterday on on
[1:09:24] Facebook on the Temple Mount faithful
[1:09:26] and there's Jews there just walking
[1:09:28] right up there by the Wailing Wall
[1:09:29] just singing and praying to God never
[1:09:31] saying God build the third temple build
[1:09:34] the third temple will rebuild the temple
[1:09:36] of Israel their brain workers are making
[1:09:39] their crane and fasten the Jews are
[1:09:41] praying and fasting because they want to
[1:09:43] see that tumbleweed be rebuilt now you
[1:09:46] and I know and that temple gets rebuilt
[1:09:48] and the coming of Christ is very near if
[1:09:50] it's not fast mm-hmm because remember
[1:09:53] they worship we saw that couple weeks
[1:09:54] ago we saw last week or two weeks ago in
[1:09:57] Daniel
[1:09:59] the Antichrist cuts off the daily
[1:10:01] sacrifice remember so the Jews will get
[1:10:04] a temple rebuilt and they'll have a
[1:10:06] daily sacrifice they'll make a cover
[1:10:07] with the Antichrist and it'll be cut off
[1:10:10] in the middle of the week so after three
[1:10:12] half years of the Covenant go get cut it
[1:10:15] off now the only way that can happen is
[1:10:18] if Jesus are decayed and he leaves the
[1:10:21] Gentiles takes the Gentiles in a rapture
[1:10:23] then he goes back to the Jews so we
[1:10:26] don't know which side that rebuilt
[1:10:28] temples on but we know the rebuilt
[1:10:30] temple is part of the end times the
[1:10:33] coming of the Lord and they're marching
[1:10:36] right now saying God rebuild the temple
[1:10:38] give us this land back amen let the
[1:10:41] mosque of Omar be torn down and let the
[1:10:43] temple of God be built amen Paul saying
[1:10:47] let's pray for Israel that they'll be
[1:10:49] saved amen praise God let's go to Psalms
[1:10:56] 122:6 Lydia 122:6
[1:11:14] it's owns 122:6 ii Alaska a church when
[1:11:25] I read these scriptures doesn't it I
[1:11:26] hope it does YouTube it makes prayer
[1:11:28] more of a reality doesn't it at the end
[1:11:32] of the service I'm gonna ask their buddy
[1:11:33] lift their hands England sugar let's
[1:11:35] lift up holy hands and pray that their
[1:11:37] the service because God's a great
[1:11:39] aviator he said we're called to make
[1:11:42] intercession and pray for all these
[1:11:44] different levels and see if God will
[1:11:47] move on our behalf
[1:11:48] praise God alright what's about to say
[1:11:52] pray for the Peace of Jerusalem they
[1:11:56] shall prosper that lovely amen see
[1:12:01] that's what I mean to pray for Israel
[1:12:02] have peace God once this people have
[1:12:04] peace God is constantly protecting
[1:12:06] Israel I just saw an article last year
[1:12:11] the palace some of the evil Palestinians
[1:12:14] they're not all evil that's ours they
[1:12:16] don't do all the evil things but some of
[1:12:18] the terrorists they had dug a channel
[1:12:21] you know there's a oh here's the wall
[1:12:23] where Israel's protect I think it was
[1:12:25] which part of us on Eastern Israel and
[1:12:28] there's a wall and they they dug a
[1:12:30] secret tunnel under Israel under the
[1:12:34] ground to try to bring in terrace at the
[1:12:39] very last moment somehow the government
[1:12:42] figured it out and they were able to
[1:12:44] stop them from getting in I think that
[1:12:48] was just last year and see the Bible
[1:12:52] says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem so
[1:12:54] see someone's prayers were heard yeah
[1:12:56] because the these evil I'll just say
[1:13:00] like this thing's an evil demon
[1:13:02] worshippers these terrorists were trying
[1:13:04] to destroy disrupt the Peace of Israel
[1:13:06] but God protected them no doubt because
[1:13:10] the prayers of the Saints maybe even
[1:13:12] their prayers as well just like we saw
[1:13:16] last week with the Six Day War God had
[1:13:18] this tiny little country defeat three
[1:13:20] big countries he confused their
[1:13:23] communication right amen he had sneak
[1:13:26] attacks come where where
[1:13:28] weren't expected the Israel to attack
[1:13:30] God will make away God is with Israel
[1:13:33] how sadness God is with us say no best a
[1:13:36] to our feet here let's let's just have
[1:13:38] Malachi come here's the last Scripture
[1:13:42] Ephesians back to Beaton's 6 verse 18 so
[1:13:48] he says if we're gonna we have we're
[1:13:51] gonna wrestle we got to have the full
[1:13:52] armor of God and then verse 18 praying
[1:13:55] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:13:57] the spirit and watching thereunto with
[1:14:01] all perseverance and supplication for
[1:14:03] All Saints all right he's got to all
[1:14:16] Fred all prayer whether supplication
[1:14:19] intercession personal prayer any prayer
[1:14:23] we should make it to the Lord and if
[1:14:25] we're fully armored with the armor of
[1:14:27] God and we can pray with confidence that
[1:14:29] God hears us praise God Lily just turn
[1:14:32] off the livestream now god bless them I
[1:14:34] don't want anyone to feel I don't want
[1:14:37] the children to feel like nervous if
[1:14:38] anyone's watching so you can just throw
[1:14:39] it off outside I do it them to raise
[1:14:41] their
