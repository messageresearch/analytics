7 AAA for the live streamers there Romans uh Book of Romans partk 27 by God's grace Romans chapter 12 verse1 I think we'll be able to preach with this chapter here in lording today by God's grace Beautiful chapter these are very familiar scriptures here at the beginning you know I felt like you know in the last few years God has really opened up verses one and two you know to us as far as understanding the perfect will of God hallelujah you know we've looked so much at the permissive will of God and the perfect will of God and everyone has a choice today everyone has a choice today to walk in the perfect will of God full obedience to the word of God or they can walk in the permissive will of God Contin continuing to live life knowing that they're disobeying parts of the word of God but thank God for his grace Hallelujah that we can repent of any mistakes we've made and we can get right back on the perfect will of God hallelujah thank God for Amazing Grace and love I'll read verse one then we can all read verse two together here verse one says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service let's read verse two ready 1 2 3 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen may God add his Blessing to reading of his word you can be seated praise God Hallelujah okay so I have some U quotes here some scriptures by God's grace it's good to see brother mercy and the the Saints there Hallelujah God bless you Hallelujah so we're looking at part 27 here on the book of Romans here uh part or chapter 12 rather by God's grace um brother brand always had a scoffield Bible you know brother mam said he didn't agree with scoffield on everything but it was just the Bible that he was uh raised on you know as a as a young Christian and he always kept it and even up to the end of his life you know I believe it was in 1965 uh brother bram's wife uh bought him a brand new Scofield bible and of course you know he preached that uh uh he preached out of that uh that one sermon birth pains right uh and there's another another important uh sermon right there it's not coming to me right now but right along with birth pains there oh yeah this day the scripture is fulfilled that's right and remember the pages stuck together and a Catholic priest comes up and said God's doing something here hallelujah and uh brother R liking that you know as a type of Jesus you know when Jesus went into the synagogue and I believe it's Luke chapter 4 and opened the scripture and said this day the scripture is fulfilled brother R said that repeated in his time where he was giving warning about birth pains right other words birth pains were starting to begin there you know in brother Ram's uh lifetime in Ministry and that's what we're seeing with the war and in I with Israel right that's a birth pain wars and rumors of wars Hallelujah uh interesting too I preached on Israel on Wednesday night you ever everybody catch that there I I caught that this morning I'm like oh my goodness I didn't even realize what I was doing uh but just a it's a reminder to pray for them remember the Bible said don't boast yourself against Israel right because God can graft us off at any time God can cut off the Gentiles any time now of course he won't cut us off because we're his people but as far as the Gentiles overall as a group of people he can be done with the Gentiles anytime and just finish it right there but God is rich in Mercy praise God and so uh let's just remember to keep Israel in Prayer by God's grace now here's the outline Scofield gives if you have a Scofield bible uh these are the uh sections he kind of divides it up into seven sections um we just finished on Wednesday night whether I didn't realize it I finished you know uh this fifth section and now we're on to the section of the Christian Life and service you know it's quite it's quite awesome to see you know he'll take 11 chapters think about you know if you wrote a real long letter to somebody you know pretend Romans was a letter you'd write to somebody to try to help them understand the gospel you know the first 11 chapters he lays out so Gentiles and Jews can understand how God has broken down the Walls between Jews and Gentiles and now we're all God's people praise God hallelujah he blinded most of the Israelis but Jesus said or Paul said there's a remnant of them that can see the gospel praise God and now he's going to take uh these next three chapters here or four chapters I'll just break it down you know if you have a a Scofield bible or any other type of a Bible that that has headings you can kind of see what you know these next few Services we're going to look at by God's grace uh today we're going to look at chapter 12 12's about the gifts of Grace that God gives to each individual and church each one of you have a gift of God some more than others right uh but it's all it's all given based upon God's ability that he gave you before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and then these all these gifts are given to us not by our Merit but by what God wants us to do and therefore our service to one another uh especially to the body of Christ Allelujah because that's what we're going to spend most of our time with right most of our time we spend with the body of Christ I'm talking about our free time right which is our family you know when we're when we leave work we don't just go spend more time with the people at work right we come and spend time with the with the body of Christ Hal Hallelujah and so that that's a very important part of Christianity is uh serving the family of God the body of Christ and so that's what we'll look at today by God's grace and then chapter 13 it's it's it's really interesting you know uh Paul goes into this chapter and he says we must submit to the authorities he was saying we must submit to the Roman government Hallelujah that's what chapter 13 is all about in other words we must obey the laws of man as long as they obey with the laws of God Hallelujah and so of course you know we know if someone uh in the government would tell us to break a law of God we know that we can obey God's word and we of course we have to deal with the consequences maybe God will deliver us maybe God won't but God expect expects expects us sorry God expects us to obey God rather than man Hallelujah but of course uh man has a uh man has a purpose I'm glad you know I'm I'm glad there's policemen they come to my house this week because of the identity theft you know I'm thank f for policemen praise God I'm thankful for law enforcement you know uh they play A Part Hallelujah God can use them for his glory as well and then of course you know uh how love fulfills the whole law in Chapter 13 chapter 14 uh Paul's telling the Jews and Gentiles don't judge each other um and he says don't cause others to stumble so make sure and we'll get into these basically Christian Liberties in chapter 14 you know we have these areas of Liberty I wrote about it in my 2019 book my first book uh there's all these areas of of Liberty you know uh of course with holidays and wine and uh different uh meats and and diet and things like that you have all these Liberties as a Christian but Paul says never cause someone to stumble in their faith whatever you allow or whatever you feel like you have the LI Liberty to enjoy just make sure you don't cause others to stumble Hallelujah and then chapter 15 now there's a chapter 16 but I I didn't list that here but chapter 16 is more of like a letter to those Saints in in Rome uh so we'll maybe just a little bit of time on that one chapter 15 is about all this why is all this important because it follows Christ's example of service to us Christ modeled complete service surrender in order to serve our needs and to help us hallelujah and that's why we should do this for others amen and then he offers hope for Jews and Gentiles and he explains about his ministry there at the end of chapter 15 so uh just kind of you kind of know where we're going here by God's grace to finish the um uh the the book here Lord willing if the Lord terries Hallelujah and I'm going to be heavy on the Greek today as you can already see I'm going to be heavy on the Greek it really helps me understand uh what Paul is is talking about and of course I'll bring in some quotes from Brother brandom as well uh by God's grace I hope this will be a help to you uh by the grace of God now remember church this this chapter Romans 12 is what was preached at the Asbury Revival last year do you remember that Kentucky remember that college started they started a 16-day Revival where they just would only leave to sleep and and pray I'm sorry to sleep and eat and they would come back 16 days straight and there was uh you can see it on video demon a demon was cast out uh people gave their hearts to God people were baptized one person said people were healed of cancer there um and so it was what we'd call a a denominational uh pouring pouring out of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah uh and and it just proves this church if people draw nigh to God God will draw nigh to them now remember friends this is all happening while the men are wearing shorts the women are wearing shorts and while they're wearing makeup and cutting their hair because Jesus said I'm I send the rain on the just and the unjust Hallelujah but I just want again see you know there's so much power in this chapter it'll cause people to not want to leave church for over two weeks Hallelujah and church many of these outpourings as I've seen too uh and I as I know I knew I know some of the people that had Revival like the Asberry one beforehand in the early 2000s God does that to call people into lifetime service see I know people that were part of another College Revival around the year 2000 when I went to college and they got saved and they had like a similar maybe it wasn't 16 days it might have been like five or six days and numerous preachers were called out of there and uh also missionaries to go be missionaries for denominational systems so you might you you and I might wonder you know why does why does God pour out you know uh revivals like that it's to get people into service like some of those young people they just need to see what does real worship look like what does what does the spirit of God feel like they've never felt it before so God has to pour out these uh blessings and pour out these revivals right right and it puts people into service right and yet we know the world fewer and fewer will be saved Jesus said few and fewer will be saved right until he gets to the spot where uh where no one else can be saved right and then God will cut off the Gentiles he'll turn back to the Jews so see you know in other words what I'm saying is God has a wise virgin God has a foolish virgin God has to have a way to catch both of them amen hallelujah how many glad God caught your attention Hallelujah God gave you Revival called you into service amen hallelujah my Revival is still going on Amen you know a lot of those people that'll only go to church on a Sunday morning they won't go on a Wednesday night they won't pray every day they won't read their Bibles listen to sermons but yet they're they're still trying to serve God thank God for that but see our lives by the message God has sent to us it should produce a life of total consecration Hallelujah that's what Romans 12 1 and two is all about finding the perfect will of God the wise versin life is what I'm talking about A Life That's aversion to Christ in other words no uh there's there's no intercourse with the things of the world right we don't get involved in the politics and and the social trends of the world we our lives are totally devoted to the service of God hallelujah in other words this church and and our body of Christ that's what we're devoted to praise God hallelujah this is what we we'll be we we'll show our full Devotion to Christ for the body of Christ that he's called here in akan Ohio praise God Amen in other words everything else is just a a filler the main thing in our lives is the perfect will of God ministering to the body of Christ here in akan praise God whereas their lives you know the main thing there is maybe social justice or the main thing there uh is equity with what they call Equity not what God calls Equity right or protests or you know uh conferences and things like like that politics and elections that's their main focus but our main focus is serving Christ Hallelujah finding the perfect will of God serving God being ready for Jesus is coming hallelujah amen and church it is worth it a life live that way is totally worth it to the cause of Christ hallelujah amen amen because the Bible says we we we come out from those unfruitful works of darkness we come out from among them and Ephesians remember Ephesians says we are to expose the unfruitful works of darkness Hallelujah because there's very few Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road Hallelujah so even amongst those revivals like we talked about the college revivals thank God for them but even amongst them there's going to be very few saved compared to the whole number of the the number of sinners in the world so Paul you know he he he finishes off this chapter on Israel and how we uh he said oh the the the depths of the knowledge of the love of God you know who who who's been God's counselor his ways are past finding out Hallelujah he Praises God for this idea of of cutting off the Jews and bringing in the Gentiles and then he starts this new chapter now he focuses on all the Christians and he says I beseech you I make a call to you I beg you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice and that means a victim so see something has to to die Hallelujah each day something has to die and it's your selfish will right it's my selfish will it's your sinful nature it has to die every day Hallelujah present your body as a victim right I killed it I killed the desires this morning right it would been easier to sleep in right it been easier to just scroll on my phone all day been easier uh just to go out to eat and skip church but know I make my body a victim Hallelujah I make my body a sacrifice that Christ might be glorified in me hallelujah hallelujah holy that means separated acceptable unto God so see there's people that live their lives and it's unacceptable God does not accept their sacrifice like Cain Hallelujah like like Saul King Saul they give a partial sacrifice they compromise parts of their lives God doesn't accept that Hallelujah and the Bible said they can still be saved but they'll have no reward but we want a reward because we've known enough We Know Better Hallelujah and we want a full reward we want to see a fruitful harvest in our lives amen we want a life that we we live and it's a life of sacrifice and we're holy separated to God God accepts us and this is our reasonable this is our logical service or our logical Ministry this is logical Jesus forgave all my sins so the very least I can do is serve him Hallelujah Jesus gave everything for me on the cross the least I can do is give him my entire life Hallelujah this this this makes sense this is logical praise God and friends this is the solution to the temptation of being prideful right well God's God's not with the Jews so much right now he's with us and of course God watches over everybody right but I'm saying he's not he's not pouring out his spear in a great way among the Jews so this is the solution here's how we here's how we show our appreciation for God's grace and we overcome the sin of Pride we present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice and we find a Ministry that we can serve God in because the Bible said boast not against the branches right we shouldn't Pat ourselves in the back well thank God we're so holy that's why we're not getting bombed by by Iran remember there's a bomb coming there's bombs coming to the US right it's thus sayith the Lord right it's thus say the scripture right all the nations will fall and Jesus will set up one new nation Hallelujah where he'll be the righteous leader of the nation Hallelujah All Nations will flow into Jerusalem one day every nation will fall except Christ's holy priesthood Hallelujah the holy nation amen the spiritual Nation The Peculiar people hallelujah so do not boast against the branches or be highminded or proudful but the Bible said fear that means honor greatly honor with great respect and reverence see we Must Die daily as the scripture says hallelujah so here's the solution let's not be prideful let's continue to make our bodies a Living Sacrifice Hallelujah you I've heard uh some message churches they don't even believe in fasting they don't even believe in prayer well that what they're doing is they're denying this scripture this scripture says your bodies have to be victims amen they have to lose something they have to feel the effects of death right they have to feel that hunger or the pain it must be done hallelujah in order to serve God right and you can see it like as we talked about the lust of the flesh people get so uh fed in these buffets or it don't have to be a buffet but they just get so so used to filling themselves up they get bigger and bigger and bigger these things should not be so it's an effect of the days of Noah Jesus says As it was the days of Noah they were eating and drinking the sin of gluttony so shall be in the days of the coming of the son of man and brother Ram said we'll pay $8 for a plate of food and slide half of it off into the trash while children are starving other countries brother Ram said God is going to make this nation pay Hallelujah but not the bride not God's people they've already passed from Death unto life amen there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that's why we don't waste so much right we shouldn't waste anything Hallelujah we should be good stewards of what God has given us praise God now verse two and be not conformed I spent a lot of time on this scripture over the last few years but I just want to read these things again here so you give us a better understanding be not conformed or that means shaped like another's pattern in other words your life shouldn't look like your coworker's life or your uh your classmates life right girls in school your life shouldn't look like their life you you shouldn't pattern yourself after them you should pattern your life after Christ Hallelujah your life should be totally different they can work on Sunday you're not gonna Hallelujah they can watch they can play those video games you're not gonna amen right you're you don't you don't look like them your life is looking more like a Christian's life all the time is that right Paul said this is how you do it first you got to be a victim you got to you got to die to your own desire and shape your life like a Christian's life and the way to do this is get new thinking a new mind a a new thought process that's the way to do this that's why brother R called it the greatest battle ever fought praise God because if we can get our mind transformed then this is possible then we can have a life because we're thinking about God's thoughts we have the mind of Christ as we think about God's thoughts our life will be shaped into the pattern of Christ life amen think about that he only lived 33 years and yet had the greatest impact of anyone on the entire history of the world because he had the mind of God hallelujah he said I only do that which the father shows me amen all my Doctrine isn't mine I've taught what I've heard from the father Hallelujah that which I see that's what I do praise God Amen so he says be not conformed to this world don't be shaped like the world's pattern but be transformed and this word is from here it's this transfigured it's the same word in other words Paul could have said be ye transfigured by the renewing of your mind now Paul's not saying you have to have light shining out from you like Jesus but that's what the word means it's a spiritual shining right when they went on Mount Transfiguration Simon preach it here I wasn't here but Simon said they went up looking like normal men but when they got up there Jesus transformed all of a sudden it's bright right it's kind of like if you're you know in the dark and all of a sudden you ever like that if you're married and or you know sometimes I've been in bed or something and my wife walk in she got the flashlight on right and I'm used to the dark and all a sudden the flashlight you know it's a transformation right it's a transfiguring and it's it's the law of contrast in other words when you're walking the perfect will of God your mind is totally turned on the light is shining now I see what God wants me to do praise God it's completely different than what I was doing like like Jonah Jonah is the great Jonah's a simple example the permissive will of God he's in the belly of a whale he's in whale vomit he's got seaweed wrapped all around him and he he he struggles to find a place to pray it's dark it's wet it smells the opposite of that when he's transforms he's brought out he sees the sunlight he gets cleaned off amen he gets regular food he lives a reg life that's the transformation it's from life to death from day to night Hallelujah from worldliness to Holy Ghost Christian Living Hallelujah that's the difference I'm talking about in your mind and that's why you know I've even experienced that this week I went from being depressed and having no hope especially with this financial situation to now I'm happy again by God's grace now God can make all things new praise Goden I'm not the only one I've met three or four people that had the identity theft this week and they said well it's going to be all right you know might be a few months hopefully you get it all back by God's grace but you just you know the uncertainty you know these these evil thoughts can Cloud your mind right I must have spent over 12 hours maybe on the phone and on the computer this week it just crazy trying to get everything back uh and Cam's like be like David and God God will make you like David you'll bring everything back from Zig lag you know you you'll restore everything I said well Amen brother I'm going to I'm going to hope in that maybe that is God's word for me I hope so but this is how we shape if we want our lives shaped like a Christian we got to have Minds that are shining right we got to have Minds that are transfigured Minds that have hope Hallelujah Minds that have the word of God just shining brightly into them praise God it's kind of like you know that uh Eclipse we saw on Monday right it was so bright how many how many how many remember you you know you can look at it but when you take off your glasses it was so bright that's that's what it's like Hallelujah right your mind your mind can be so dark but when when when when when your mind gets the thoughts of God everything changes there's power amen power in the word of God you get you get motivation you get inspiration it shines Hallelujah there's there's power in the light of God there's power in the word of God gives you a brand new outlook hallelujah amen this is the only way to serve God this is the only way Hallelujah to be a Living Sacrifice praise God you all know it you know when we're we're struggling with mind battles I know it this week when we're struggling with mind battles uh we don't do much service for God we just worry complain and fret and get frustrated nothing's being done for God that's why we need a transformation Hallelujah when our minds get transformed something gets done for God's Glory Hallelujah and not Glory Hallelujah he said be transformed by the renewing or the renovation of your mind and I think this this brings to light that scripture uh the entrance of God's word is light from the book of Psalms there's a scripture that says the entrance of God's word brings light so when God's word enters your thoughts it renovates the whole place Hallelujah I remember when we renovated this place I got pictures of of it when Mali and Casa were painting and the walls were dirty filthy in here the the carpet was nasty oh boy it was nasty dirty but we come in here and we renovated It Out by God's grace it's a total transformation now it's numerous years old now it's almost 10 years old now I'm very thankful for this place Hallelujah is that right trustees we got our contract coming up at the end of this year wherever God leads us we we want to go wherever God leads us but that that's a great uh aspect of renovation that's a great application when God's word comes into your mind it cleans out your mind it renovates it makes it brand new again Allelujah changes your thinking for the good that you may prove and this means to test or examine or scrutinized like Metals what is good and acceptable what's the perfect will of God so when you Church you have to we have to remember this the only time when we really know we're doing the perfect will of God is when we obey the word of God and we have a transformed mind if we're wondering whether we're in the perfect will of God or permissive will of God it's time to repent it's time to obey every word that we know and then when we do that then we can prove I know what God called me to do and see Church you're going to need you're going to need signs from God to know that you're doing what God wants you to do right with with many people in the Bible they had to ask God remember Gideon had to ask God for signs right David had to go David had to know God's word about his future before he could act on it he had to know I'm going to be king and all the he had to know God had to tell him right so God will tell us what God wants us to do praise God hallelujah and so just examples in my life many times I've asked God to give me uh signs am I called to preach and God always has done that you know to confirm different things in my life God's always done that the recent one I told you about was when uh my children were younger and we had another family in the church and they stopped coming to all the services and I laid right here before God and I beg God he said God as a give me a sign that by attending more services that's your perfect will give me a Sign by filling my children with the Holy Ghost before those children get the Holy Ghost and God Vindicated it God gave me the sign amen hallelujah amen hallelujah see now I can prove I've done the perfect will of God hallelujah and over the years I've we seen many other signs that we we made the right choice Hallelujah remember brother R tells us in the church age book I don't know Mercy if you know this brother bam said the secret to Christianity is increasing your service to God brother tells us that in the th tan Church age Jesus knew their Works their love their faith and I know your works and the last are more than the first hallelujah amen hallelujah we've got to increase our service for God we've got to be a a servant for God we have to know the ministry God wants us to do amen now as you can kind of see where I'm going now uh if you know this chapter so once your mind is transformed and and and you're thinking God's thoughts then you can test and prove am I in the perfect will of God or am I out of the perfect will of God and you can prove it by what God has done by answering your prayers or giving you vindications or words from the Lord like uh you know Simon Simon you know I don't think he'd mind me telling this I'll I'll send him a message after this if I remember but Simon you know for years just wondered was he called to preach right and I would always tell him brother you're called to preach brother you got a gift I mean he shared things with me since 2001 here's 20 23 years later for all these years he told me all these Revelations and my didn't see that I said brother you're called to preach well I can't call myself a preacher I'm just I just do Bible studies I said you're a teacher brother and that's how it is sometimes we can't see our own gifts but other people thank God other people can see them sometimes Hallelujah one time he was thinking about getting out of the ministry I came in there and preached uh that that sermon about diligence remember my diligence sermons there and Simon said that that was exactly the word of wisdom he needed to hear and remember last year remember he preached those nine things that discern things I had questions about things I study things in my life and I went out there and I sat in the rain maybe we stood there for 5 minutes Mal I don't know how long it was I stood there soak and wet for 10 minutes just to tell them brother you don't let anybody tell you you're not called to preach and then he got ordained when we were there the last time finally by God's grace and the brothers were saying why don't you smile we're taking pictures you know at the ordaining he's like why don't you smile he said it's a serious thing and I said yeah brother but you know once you're a preacher you can smile you you know so I I share with him the picture when I got ordained I wasn't smiling either I was like oh God help me my wife smiling you know brother Brooks is smiling he's like here's you I'm like God help me help me to be a faithful witness right but now I can smile because God has given me signs amen I can prove the perfect will of God hallelujah so when God's word enters our thoughts and our mind and our lives we can see a total difference it's a night and day difference Amen brother amen can see in his life his denomination life and now this life Hallelujah I can see the same in mine our sisters each one of us can oh it's for like night and day Hallelujah I wish sometimes we could pull up the sermon they preach at the CMA church or my former Assembly of God Church and compare it to how I'm preaching today or brother Brooks you know or brother cam what would the difference be it's night and day Hallelujah verse three for I say through the grace or the favor given unto me to every man that's among you not to think himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly so apparently in the church people thought really highly of themselves boy I'm somebody special I'm look who I'm I'm brother so and so I'm sister so and so I'm somebody great so Paul had to tell them don't think you're so great and handsome right Brothers right oh I'm so handsome look at me let me take a selfie of my big muscles or my big Faith look at my big Faith you know apparently these people you know they were they were really wonderful people but apparently they had trouble with pride so he said you know God's given you Grace but don't think too highly of yourselves now that's what I feel like happened in the message these preachers think so highly of themselves they call themselves the greatest of all time that's a sin but here wouldn't this help everybody Hallelujah wouldn't reading the Bible preaching the Bible help out everybody in the message you understand don't think more highly than you ought to think but to think soberly now that means a a moderate estimate of oneself now the example I give is Jesus said everybody's got either one Talent two talents or five talents so you know you know the most practical way brother Austin I can apply this to my life is say I'm a one Talent preacher I can't go wrong with that is that right so in humility brother amen would say I'm a one Talent song leader and that's a gift of healing now that's a holy ghost gift I've been healed many times through brother amen songs Mali is playing oh I just get the presence of God I feel so good I confess whatever I worship God it's a blessing Hallelujah that's what music is music heals so let's apply that practically you know whatever you have to recognize you want to find your gift but make it on a smaller level so then if it's greater then you you didn't go around bragging about it Hallelujah so don't think so highly as you ought to that's just one simple application I've always tried to apply to my life I know I got at least one talent to preach at least one brother Mercy I got at least one brother Jose Hallelujah I got a little bit by God's grace or to pray for the sick or for healing hallelujah or teaching or wisdom or whatever it may be knowledge he said but think soberly put a put a moderate estimate how much talent do you have a little bit of talent according as God had dealt which means to separate or cut in pieces God took a he did on the day of Pentecost amen God had his spirit and he gave everybody a little lick of fire amen everybody got a piece amen the the awesome part is as soon as he cut it and divided it he still had that same amount because he's infinite praise God if we cut a if we cut a pizza in pieces we're going to run out if God Cuts himself in pieces he ain't going to run out hallelujah amen hallelujah he's infinite Hallelujah am amen so God separates God cuts out aart a gift of faith for each one of us and he gives you that gift think of that children you got a part of God's spirit and it's a part of God and he gives every man the measure or the portion of Faith so you might have five talents of Faith you might have two talents of Faith now imagine there's a four and a three in there too I don't know why the parable just says 521 imagine there's all levels in there right and so God gives you uh uh some amount but he said don't don't get prideful about it okay now I've always put these verses together in my mind you know I've misquoted these scriptures I've always put these together for some reason I don't know why if it was a song or my my past but Jesus said ask and you shall receive that uh that your joy may be full so there's some prayers uh Jesus wants us to ask so we'll be joyful Hallelujah God want there's times God wants us to be so joyful we might dance around the church or we might jump and praise the Lord hallelujah amen he said ask that you shall receive that your joy may be full so sometimes God wants us to pray and say God fulfill this and then God wants to see us rejoice about it amen hallelujah praise God Amen you don't want to see us come to church all stiff and starchy like I'm not giving God any praise come on preacher make me happy I can't make you happy Jesus's Joy makes you happy amen hallelujah but God's word ought to make ought to make us happy hallelujah hallelujah I get all that money back I'm gonna have another dance for god you watch hopefully we'll see you by Wednesday night Hallelujah either way I owe God a dance because at least I got a fourth of it back Hallelujah because it was stolen from me and I can't do anything about it I'm at the mercy of these other people but I've asked God that my joy might be full Hallelujah Ephesians 3:20 now to him that's able to exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think Hallelujah so see we're we're supposed to make our request and then God may do more than what we even ask Hallelujah but with our own individual gifts we're just humble with them oh brother you had this good testimony sister you have this good testimony always humble yourself in those moments well it was just God's grace right don't give any glory to ourselves give all the glory to Christ now this reminded me of the parable the talents remember Jesus tells a story he's like a man who's leaving and he gives uh three people different amounts of money a talent is money and I worked it out it's it's either like you know $5 million or $1 million the highest amount you know I work worked it out I put in the book there by God's grace now what God wants you to do is to trade with your gifts which means to labor or do work or exercise now what that means of course we don't work for we don't work for God as far as like we earn it but what that means is God wants us to Die daily God wants us to spend some time laboring in prayer right he wants us to spend some time dying to ourselves the Bible said exercising your faith Hallelujah Godly exercise prophets Hallelujah other words God wants you to God wants you to reach out in the Holy Spirit remember the the three steps for being on fire brother R tells us three steps of being on fire reaching out in the spirit a fervent desire to please him and a passion to know his word amen that's how you know you're on fire amen amen you got those three steps Hallelujah and so with with when we see God move in our lives if God has a testimony or something that we got to say Lord do more of that in my life God here I'm I'm fasting I'm praying I'm setting myself aside for a service amen and so God use me if you want to use me you can use me praise God you got to trade you got to invest in it right now the sin of this Parable was hiding or concealing God's money that he gives to the people hide it or conceal it where it doesn't gain anything right just hiding it away from the world see church that's why when you come to church you want God to use you you want you want God to speak to you at church right so there there's testimonies about your life Hallelujah I want testimonies about my life each one of us want testimonies about our lives that proves we're not hiding God's talent that He gave us but we're exercising it hallelujah we're we're trying to invest it oh God use me today let me be led by the Holy Spirit praise God Amen lead me and I'm going to show you a real common example youve probably heard before but I'm going to show you an example here in a little bit and then Jesus rebukes him and said you should not have hid it you should have gave it to the exchangers you should have took it to the bankers and at least got a little bit of benefit Hallelujah right and church I I I'll just be honest I always see little gains in all your character amen even the little children right like with Haven and Caris even encouraged me this week both of them were encouraging me I'm a grown man I'm a preacher right I preach I know God's word some of it you know by God's grace a little bit being humble I know very little by God's grace but I I preach what I know but I can even see how God's using them to get my mind like like last night Haven said Daddy it's just like pressure you've had all this pressure this week it's just like the Potter and the clay you preached on a few weeks ago I'm like yes I want to bang my head on this Pulpit yes that's right don't forget silly you know you just preach on that pressures on your life but it's going to form you and to make you into the vessel God wants you to be praise God Amen all this pressure in our lives see God moved her mind to that and I can see that's that's keeping now that's impacting me praise God hallelujah or leaving you know a little uh Caris had a nice little rhyme on there I can't remember it now but don't worry about the money and all these things like that just trusting God all just nice pictures like that she even offered to give us some money bless her heart that that's sweet as you could be you know by God's grace but you know this is what I'm saying you know with all of our Lives we should see little testimonies all around us praise God there should always be some some little things going on in our lives oh that was a little blessing when our brother did that or our sister oh that really helped me when the sister sang that or did that and we see little blessings in our lives Hallelujah that means it's our talents are being invested hallelujah amen remember Church you have one of these or more and then brother BR tells us at any time God can use you for one of these a Word of Wisdom that's timely advice are managing your Affairs you know relationships Financial you know anything any Affairs in your life you have to deal with right Church situations a word of wisdom will tell you what to do at the right time knowledge is just understanding oh now I understand Jesus said it's a key of knowledge it opens up a door oh okay yeah I can walk into that now now I understand it right that was like with the Philip and the unic the unix's like who's this talking about ma Isaiah 53 and Philip said let me preach you I'm preaching to one person a one a one person congregation I'm preaching Jesus unto you praise God and then you understand I understand can I be baptized if you believe with all your heart how many believe in Jesus with all your heart today hallelujah amen believe him with all your heart amen invest in that Talent Hallelujah say God used my talent Lord I'm surrendered here I'm I'm making my body a victim amen I'm killing my desires I'm doing what God wants me to do today hallelujah amen or maybe some of you got faith that's a revelation of God's will which is a trust and belief that God is going to do something amen the Roman centor had great faith just speak the word I know it'll be done Miracles spontaneous powerful healings Supernatural things unexplainable God does a miracle Hallelujah prophecy foretells or predicts the future many times with us it's dreams Hallelujah I had a dream this week I don't know if I remember this or not but I had a dream I was preaching at a church in Lima and it was really uh there was hardly anybody there the pastor wasn't there I know who the pastor is I met him before uh and it was just a strange it was like it was like all the things leading up to the service there's it was even a different building you know and I was going up there to preach and I didn't quite know what I was going to preach and that's when the dream ended so I don't know if there's any significance to that or not but I've had dreams that come to pass let me tell you this one you probably remember this one I told it before but just so everybody remembers I had a dream about a brother in the message he just got married to his wife and in the dream they're they're they're on a a tennis court and there's a fence and he's playing tennis but he's in a girl's outfit the the short skirts and it's pink and he's got the tank top on a man I'm like this is strange this guy's a message believer we've done Bible studies he's baptized and then his wife is there sitting at the fence looking in like I wish I could play I wish I could join in I went and told the brother this was years ago this was probably 200 uh before we started the church so 2004 2005 and the brother's like well I don't play tennis brother so this this doesn't apply to me but later he he confessed it later he confessed he during that time when I told him the dream he wasn't studying the Bible he was playing solitary on his phone so games tennis is a game game fast forward 10 years he leaves the message we're I'm on Facebook brother Jose him and his wife put a picture on Facebook he's got his shirt off playing tennis and she's got these sexy clothes on playing tennis they were warned Hallelujah and I told the brother I said I said here's now this was in 2004 10 years before it happened I said brother you're playing around with games and if you don't stop it you're going to draw your wife into this and it wasn't taken heed now see church I'm not a prophet but brother man says if there's no prophets on the Earth God will send you a dream hallelujah amen so be careful Hallelujah take heed to dreams amen if if they're spiritual right and then Discerning which is judging Spirits okay this is from God this is from the devil that's discernment right that's what Peter had when he discerned ananas and Safa why have you agreed together to lie to the Holy Ghost nobody told nobody told Peter but God told Peter here God gave him the ability to to judge that their statement that's not a true statement right that's from the wrong spirit and then tongues of course is uh languages of men or languages of angels and interpretation is uh making known the meaning of those remember these are the Lesser gifts now these are the ones we want to see right right as a natural person right but really God values these more Hallelujah didn't the Bible say with all your G getting get tongues is that what the Bible says with all you're getting get wisdom hallelujah amen that's what Solomon said now there's nothing wrong with these gifts thank God for them but they're so impersonated today where nobody knows what they're saying and if it's a real gift of God and there's no interpreter the Bible said be quiet in the church Hallelujah now we haven't had one since 2016 so it's been eight years since we had a tongue but if God wants to send one we'll take one Hallelujah but we will not seek the gifts instead of The Giver we must seek Jesus Christ amen I tell you which one is going to help you more speaking an unknown tongue where it just edifies you with no interpretation or giving somebody a Word of Wisdom the exact thing they need to do at the right moment like with brother Simon said that he was thinking about quitting preaching but the word of wisdom came invest in your gift and God will bless you hallelujah amen now most of you know this you've heard of this but I wonder how many have listened to it read it so I'm going to read it now brother ra says the only thing a minister can do would be to point you to the one who did save you or heal the Healer points you to the one that's already healed you and the church said you know not not no preacher can heal no brother or sister can heal all we can do is try to get you to look to the Healer now in doing so God set in the church first apostles teachers prophets all kinds of gifts for the perfecting of the body you believe that don't you now that's what I believe that God has set in this church some that can preach like some of the ministers here others are great teachers and Scholars in the word some are seers and sees Visions some of those who speak with tongues some of those who interpret some of those who have great faith in healing that's called Gifts of healing or gift of healing there's no such thing as the gift of healing because it's in the plural its gifts that's why music is one way to heal right brother R said Bulldog Faith like or Roberts you just speak to those devils and command them to move but as brother Bram he never yelled at the demons he just said Satan I rebuke you just so humble right but you have to move you have to operate in the gift that God has given you in other words where have you seen God used you before you want to try to keep going like that hallelujah amen praise God God works in many different ways to heal the sick sometimes preaching the word sometimes a neighbor sitting by you and just lay his hand over on you feel like he should do so think about that just person can just lay their hand and pray for you and you'll be made well always do that brother says always do that when you feel led to pray for somebody that's why church I invite you to sometimes I'll invite you to come up let's pray for this person but really you don't have to have my invitation let me just announce it here officially you won't hurt brother Jesse's feelings I won't stop church and say you're out of order when have I ever done that if you're led by the Holy Spirit follow God's leading it's way better than anything else amen follow God's leading sorry always do that whatever a born again child of God feels to pray for the sick that's the Holy Spirit moving in you to do so no matter who's going to pray for the person you go ahead and pray for them anyhow see if you feel a burden on your heart to do something and you know it's not selfish you know it's of God then follow that leading we just had something that happened in Louisiana now this is the part you'll be remembering right he said there was a lady got a prayer card she had a little baby she was rocking the little baby and another poor little mother sitting there she felt so sorry for the little mother with the baby on her arm she said well I some just told her go pray for that baby how many know this story most people okay oh she said I couldn't do that brother Brandon will pray for that baby oh the preacher got to do this this can't be God the preachers got got more power in prayer than I do well he might have more gifts but God may not want to use that gift at this time God might want to use your gift Church so each one of us can we identify with being a poor little mother can each one of us just be just realize how insignificant and how humble we are remember don't esteem yourself too highly Hallelujah don't make yourself too great or I got all these gifts or I got all this power and authority with God make yourself a poor little mother or poor little brother Hallelujah they got a prayer card but it just kept going now notice this if if God's leading you to do something and you don't obey the first time he's going to give you another nudge okay pushing so something was push pushing her go pray for the little baby so wasn't just one time wasn't twice and after a while a little lady come around again she's seen that baby the holy spirit said go a third time go pray for that baby see church if God wants you to do something he's going to help you do it and if you miss just say I'm sorry Lord help me to be more sensitive next time and you're forgiven there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus but because of our love for God we want to do what he he's called us to do Hallelujah so the timid little mother we got any timid little saints in here today I would say most of us are pretty timid in here right nobody walks up here and say brother Jesse let me tell you all about it let me do this let me do that I mean who's the most outspoken amongst us probably me brother Jose maybe Austin you know who who who enjoys talking in front of people we don't have we have a lot of timid people here by God's grace right so we can relate to this right timid little Believers and that's what I I want to be a timid little in God's sight Hallelujah I'm used to being the pastors I'm used to being in front of people but I want an attitude where I'm humble before God I want to approach god with reverence and and godly respects Hallelujah and honor so the Tim mother you know walked up to the lady and said sister I see you have a prayer card perhaps brother brand will pray for your baby tonight she said well we're hoping that number will be called sister she said would you excuse me if I said something to you look how humble her approach is not like bless God sister let me get out of your way give me this baby I'm gonna pray for her right now I've got faith right now would it be okay look how humble would it be okay if I I ask you something would it would it be okay see God always works in humility so certainly sister she said I'm a Christian too and I'm a mother and just to relieve my conscience so just to help me out for the last 30 minutes now look at that over half an hour God's dealing with her go pray for the baby go pray so Church let's remember that this week let's remember that if God deals with you for a number of minutes it's probably something you should do and this was so simple like right God's God's not asking her to part the Red Sea right God's not asking her to speak something into exist existance God's asking her go lay your hands on the baby and pray for the baby for half an hour see church that's what you'll see too in Services when a preacher is preaching on something and he keeps going back at it and you know it's for you that's probably God for like half hour or maybe the whole hour sermon like that one time Simon preaches like the whole sermon was just for me like okay God's talk I just you see me sometimes I I'll write notes but once Simon started saying that I put my notebook down I'm like oh God's talking to me yep Hallelujah I mean God God God has a way to get your attention timid little Believers like we are Hallelujah would would you mind if I just prayed for the baby before you took it up to brother BR would that be okay it would just help me out so much she said why certainly she had nothing to worry about and she let the she let the little baby out and the mother prayed for it and she said thank you for letting me pray for your baby I just I got to get this off my heart I just got this burden can I just pray for the baby walk back very timid little Southern mother sat down and when she went back to sit down somebody got the seat so she had to go away up in the balcony she even lost her seat the devil said see you lost your seat you should not have went and prayed for her now you got to stand the whole service now you're not going to enjoy service get behind me Satan I I went to the variety store Hallelujah I got my Divine Healing out Hallelujah and I checked out amen and I've got God's receipt hallelujah amen hallelujah have a bad day devil Hallelujah that's right lost my seat that's all right I'm a timid little Christian that's okay like like we're going to get to I prefer others above myself if somebody needs a chair you can have my chair and so that night on the platform sure enough she's in the prayer line the lady comes she got near of course and praying for the sick all you know how it happens I looked back over the recordings that was taken the lady was told by the Holy Spirit your baby has a certain disease yes there's a woman today dressed a certain way prayed for the baby it's already been healed and there was a little lady sitting up there in the balcony just what screaming hallelujah thank you Jesus I finally obeyed after a half an hour of wondering whether it was God's spirit and the church said I so happy I'm so thankful I was used by God Amen God nudged me for half an hour and I finally surrendered to the leadership of the holy spirit that would make anybody shout hallelujah amen God used me I'm a humble little timid Christian at bright of Christ Fellowship in a little old akan Ohio I'm a timid little Christian and God used me to heal somebody Hallelujah it wasn't me but God used my lips Hallelujah God used my faith amen hallelujah that don't make anybody scream Glory a timid little woman screaming up in the balcony oh thank you Jesus amen now God had ordained that that woman should pray for that baby even though brother random was there to pray for the baby you see how it was see how the Holy Spirit works the Bible said confess your faults to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed that's just not for preachers that's for everybody pray for one another so when God puts somebody on your heart and it's more than just one thing you should pray for that person what and I'll say like this when I'm walking in the spirit I just want one nud just give me I think you understand what I'm talking about you you understand too when you're walking in the spirit all you need is one nudge sometimes right how many you have seen that before one time I was uh somebody just called me on the phone I think and I was driving home from work I was I remember I was turning right on to 585 on 21 South and I talked to him on the phone and I and I said I I'll pray for you as soon as we hang up I hung up and while I'm driving I just prayed for them and within a few moments I got the prayer request back that God had helped the person or maybe it was an hour it wasn't long after that and it was just one little prayer the Holy Spirit didn't have to nudge me you're Pray Again again you're home now pray again no no no Pray Again what I'm saying is that sorry I don't mean to push you but you understand what I'm saying you could beat me up anyways you don't understand what I'm saying when we're when we already have a transformed mind we'll pray right away praise God but if we're uncertain God will give us a little nudge come on Jesse come on I got students all the time that they have defiant disorders and so whatever I tell them they'll do the opposite I'll say line up they'll go the other way and so I have to gently gently move them into line we we we have permission you gently push him on the back and gently that's what God does to us sometimes we got defiant disorders oh my goodness Hallelujah sometimes we get evil spirits in our minds right doubt fear depression anger Hallelujah and God's got to push us and finally when we finally get in position God will use us we we'll start screaming thank God thank God for using my hble timid little life Hallelujah Glory see there's no individual person can heal it's not brother Jesse or anybody else healing no person can even save you against your will to heal you against your will it has to be your attitude towards Jesus Christ that determines your healing God just uses other people to encourage you to believe he said now God has s ministers to preach he put the word out there he put ministers to preach different things he's got members in the church people in the church God has said set the church in order and if the people would just get in the place where God put them then the church would be in order and I'm talking about myself too I'm not just reading that for all of you I want myself in order I realized this week I can't be in order if I'm struggling with certain things right if I'm if I can I lose sleep over this situation right I can't be in my right place I need God to rescue me Hallelujah I need God to transform My Mind by the renewing of my mind I believe this only through that since I've been repent pcal people I explain that as a Doctrine I believe the gifts and callings of God are without repentance we just preached on that on on Wednesday night Romans 11 I'm sorry yes and there's no way at all for you to do anything I believe in the election of God that God does the electing that means the choosing God does the calling you taking thought you could not add one cubit to your stature see but whatever God is determined to be it will be and you are called by election I've heard people say oh I sought God day and night no man never sought God at any time that's some good grammar right there no man never no never that's a double negative no man never sought God at any time God seeks man not man seeking God hallelujah if you ever sought God it was God saying seek me come on push me push me come on Jesse come on Amen come on Austin put seek me seek me seek me and when we finally seek him then we get the blessing of seeking him Hallelujah but it wasn't us that sought God it was God moving us to seek him come on Jesse come on come on come on Along beatric come on on right come on along Casey Come on God leading us into this it's God's calling it's God's election he said that's the very nature of God from the beginning it wasn't Adam Adam Adam should have been running around father father where are you it was God saying Adam Adam where are you when Adam sinned he wasn't saying God God God help me it was the exactly opposite running from Adam ran from God and God had to run after him same thing applies to us and I love this great verse Jeremiah 1:4 God told Jeremiah before you was even conceived in your mother's womb before you came from the belly I knew you I Sanctified you I ordained you a prophet to the Nations what did Jeremiah have to do with that let's all say together what he have to do with it he had nothing nothing huh so brother Mercy you had nothing to do with with the gifts God has placed in your life you had nothing to do with it brother Jose you had nothing to do with it it was all God God called you before you in your mother's womb he ordained you and he has a purpose for you Hallelujah and you just have to submit to his purpose Hallelujah that's all you have to do find what God's called you to do Paul said you must find the mystery of God's will Hallelujah God did it you had nothing to do with what God's called you to be like I told you this before too two people that knew me one is a sinner and one when I first got saved they knew automatically I was going to be a preacher and like I didn't think I was going to be a preacher I never I grew up in church I never thought I was going to be a preacher I didn't never feel like oh one day I'll get up there and I'll preach I never felt like that but this you know this former girlfriend I had in the world she once I got saved you know she just emailed me when to see how I was doing I said well I'm starting to preach the gospel you know she's like I always knew you'd be a preacher I'm like you didn't tell me that I mean not not that I needed her to tell me that but just interesting how did you see that in me and I wasn't even saved and then uh remember brother Browning came his wife she was here the first time she met me she said he's going to be a preacher I wish somebody would told me that too but I didn't see that I didn't see it but God has determined it's what God does I don't you and I have nothing to do with it it's God doing what he wants to do amen we are the he's the Potter amen it's God's Sovereign Grace his favor that does things God has set a church that's going to appear without spot or wrinkle he's already said that the church is foreordained and church you're a member in the body of Christ because you've been baptized into the holy spirit that makes you a member of the body of Christ Hallelujah now let's keep going in this chapter I told I told you I'm going to finish this chapter today I didn't know I was going to preach like this or the Lord was going to preach like this first we have many members in one body all members have not the same office which means a mode of acting we don't act all the same we don't all have the same business so we being many are one body in Christ and every me everyone members of One Another We're limbs of one another we're all connected to one another this is a limb right it's connected to so I'm connected to you you're connected to me we're all connected one to another kind like blood vessels that's a good way to look at it or nerves they're all connected to each other having then gifts differing according to the grace or favor that's given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith now that word doesn't have a Greek meaning uh the translators put that word in there because it may it made the the the the scripture make sense it fit with the other scriptures above like the measure of the gift earlier that we read so the in the Websters it means a equal share everybody can use their gifts with the share that God's given them the portion God's given them right the easiest example is brother brandom right brother Bram had the prophetic gift the son of man Ministry he could tell them all the thoughts intents of their heart by the vision well if I have a dream right I can I had that dream I could tell the brother the thoughts of his heart right with playing with games but I couldn't do it like brother brandom I just have a little small little measure right understand so we can clearly see with brother Ram or Jesus Look what Jesus could do look at all the healings look he'd heal everybody man he would discern he know all the secrets and he it was God in flesh amen it was the fullness of God had bodily praise God but you and I have a small portion Hallelujah but remember brother Ram said if you have a spoonful of the ocean you got the same chemicals as the rest of the ocean amen hallelujah if you got the Holy Ghost you've got a portion of the same life that's in Christ hallelujah amen amen now we definitely don't want to think more highly of our gifts than we ought to but we also don't want to limit God's gifts right so it's a great balance right we don't want to be too prideful but we don't want to be too humble Hallelujah so how do you know you know because you're confessed all your sins and you're looking for God's signs you're looking for God's leading in your life that's how you know Hallelujah verse seven or Ministry let us wait on the ministering now this is interesting this word ministry can mean a service a deacon or food preparation in other words wait until it's God's time for you to do this service that you're going to do or he that teacheth on teaching Simon's done a good job of that he's waited on God he's just been faith fful only has a few churches calling him now you know that's kind of like me the more the more we preach God's word you know the less invitations we get well that's fine by God's grace I'm not going to apologize for anything I believe if I can find it in the Bible by God's grace if people don't like it that's fine I like God's word hallelujah verse eight or he that exhorteth this means to comfort beg teach or instruct on exhortation see God has called some of us to exhort one another right that's what we looked at on Wednesday night God has called some of us to encourage each other right and some people have a gift to do that some people can really Comfort somebody or really teach or instruct somebody now he that giveth so some some people are better givers than others is that right oh yeah I've seen I've seen Christians they'll just hoard all their money like like they're going to take all their money to heaven with them right I mean you're not going to take anything with you and other people just give it away to you hardly got any anything left and sometimes finances get tight if you would have kept it more of it you would they wouldn't have been so tight but you want to give it away that's true and he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity or honesty or free from hypocrisy right that's what Paul says God loves a cheerful Giver whatever you give just be happy about it he that ruleth like a leader a preacher Deacon a trustee let him do it with diligence or earnestness right Earnest means you really want to get it done you're really focused on it you you you you're aware of what's going on you're not slothful and ignoring it you're Earnest about it you're going to make sure you're going to follow through and get this done he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness or Readiness of mind so see some people have a gift of they have this Mercy that they express they're so cheerful they're so ready to show Mercy on people that might not seem very easy to show Mercy on praise God now you're getting quiet now say everybody's getting tired so I'm about my hour and a half so let me see where I should close I just need let me be sensitive to let me feel the nudge of the Holy Spirit here I Don't Preach too long by God's grace let love be without dissimulation which means disguise don't put a disguise on I love you take it off I hate you I love you I ha you that shouldn't be like that Hallelujah that's what the Bible said love and make sure you don't have a mask no masks amen just be you Hallelujah now look at this abhor that which is evil now God help us to have horror for sins I'm talking about sins on our cell phones I'm talking about sins uh thought life right any sin like we all know about horror movies if you're a sinner you know thankfully our children don't know too much you know but if you're a sinner you know what a horror movie is the Bible said we should have horror towards sin have horror towards that which is evil but be glued to that which is good amen just stay around that anything that's good just connect yourself with that all the time stay in the good stay in the good hate the evil stay in the good this is advice for Christians Hallelujah be kindly affection which means loving tenderly one to another with Brotherly Love sometimes I love these brothers so much I got to kiss them on their necks you know when I first come in the message I'm like how could they do that and I'm like I totally understand how they could do that they've been prayed for me they've been with me during my tough times they've been faithful they've done so much for me how could I not love them had to learn i' had to learn these things there's one brother used to kiss me all the time he don't kiss me anymore so I I probably need to talk to him did I offend you brother with something I said that's from over in another church he said be affectioned one to another with brotherly love that means cherishing one another I cherish our time together I don't want to take it for granted because something could happen in honor preferring one another so here is leadership so show the Bible says you should show you should cherish one another and then lead others into love so lead by example don't wait for somebody else to be kind you and I should be the leaders in kindness that that's what preferring one another means yeah I'm I'm going to take initiative and I'm going to show kindness first because that's what a Christian should do right I'm going to cherish this person because I prefer them right because I I want to I want to lead by example how many know Jesus led by example the Bible said don't be slothful which means sluggish or reluctant in your business now there's all days we don't want to go to work sometimes your work's right in your house right right stay at home moms sometimes the work is right in your house and so the Bible tells us don't be reluctant to work but be fervent amen which means I'm zealous to do good I'm I'm zealous to work I'm excited to go to work and the church said I'm excited to go to work tomorrow amen amen he said be fervent serving the lord this means to be a slave now look at this I I want to show you what I see this word be be fervent serving the lord it actually means to literally be a slave this is the Greek Lexicon in other words I a slave to God like brother R says I'm a love slave to Jesus Christ amen I put myself into this slavery amen because if if I don't brother amen if I don't be a slave to Christ I'm gonna be a slave to sin so I know this is the right way amen I'm be a slave either way I'm I can't serve two masters I want to serve the master that I love amen I'm going to make my body a victim Hallelujah I'm going to make my body a sacrifice so I can be a slave to the one that I love amen I know what it's like to be a slave to to evil sins to to to drugs I know what on some level I know what that's like I don't want to be a slave to that I want to be a slave to the one who set me free from that hallelujah amen I want to yield my obedience to Christ I don't want to be a reluctant servant we've all like that's what I got this week I'm on the phone with some of these companies they're really reluctant they don't want to help me out uh can you do this no sorry I can't do that you need something else can't you help me out a little bit NOP sorry I got a call back we don't have that service here or you got to pay $149 to get your email back that's not a very good that's not a helpful servant or they're reluctant oh I guess I can help now some people were very helpful amen this PNC Down the Road God bless them amen they they're really helpful Hallelujah but we don't want to be reluctant like well I guess I'll help I I guess I'll do something nice let's be ready to help let's be fervent verse 12 rejoicing which means to be glad in Hope be glad in expecting God's goodness how many expect God to do something good in your life be patient which means endure your pressures right right Haven that was good scripture there Haven we're the clay he's the Potter be be patient to endure when God puts pressure on your life and he allows it just and just get through it so I woke up Monday morning that's when I first logged in I checked my finances that's when I saw oh I'm hacked and I finally had Grace Friday by Friday I was finally got got out of this pressure finally my accounts are frozen finally no more money's going out and I could just breathe a sigh relief yesterday Hallelujah just had to endure it a whole week of stress continuing instant in prayer now that means being always ready to pray always be ready to pray for somebody now I'm going to finish up I'm going to finish this chapter because this this my hour and a half Distributing to the necessity of the Saints so not the wants of the Saints but the needs of the Saints amen right we've all seen different people at different churches where uh they want the they want things but it's not their needs it's the needs of the Saints Hallelujah right so it's very important that we recognize that remember in the book of Acts uh they were ignoring widows that didn't even have daily food they wouldn't even give them daily food think about that a book of Acts church and some of these people were so proud they wouldn't even give the widows any food throughout the day God's got to come around and say I'm going to raise up some Holy Ghost filled men called deacons they're going to make sure these women get their food it's it's striking that Christians need reminders about the Necessities Hallelujah given to hospitality so we should be willing to host other people praise God bless them which persecute you bless and curse not that's what's been happening to me some a lot of people or a few people been cursing me online what's my job to say God bless you you don't like what I preach God bless you I'm not going to curse you God's GNA take care of it right I'm going to bless them well I hope God blesses you with a repentant heart Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep so again recognizing the seasons of our lives right if somebody's really happy let's be happy with them praise God if somebody's sad let's show them care and compassion let's cry some tears with them as well Hallelujah this is what a Christian does remember this chapter caused a 16-day Revival last year preaching this chapter see because these college student they had never done any of this before the church said they were going to that's a Christian College they go there to be to learn how to be a Christian like to and so the you know this struck them at this time like wow I just want to I Just Want To Worship I never want to leave the church for two weeks they didn't know how long it was going to last but see this is and you know a a lot of those kids that go to these Christian Schools they're raised in church but they never had an experience themselves aren't you glad Church you had an experience with God you're not a you're not a Pentecostal grandchildren amen you're not a grandchild amen you had the experience amen I was there when the spirit came Hallelujah God changed my life God inspired my life I felt the anointing I knew God's spirit was on me Hallelujah God's spirit moved through me the Holy Spirit spoke through my lips hallelujah amen a lot of these people never had their own personal experience I just say thank God if they got one hallelujah hallelujah let me say this if they got one I'll just say it like this may God give you Grace because the spirit of God will lead you in the wilderness to be tempted I just read that this week Jesus gets the Holy Ghost and then the spirit of God the next chapter leads him in the wilderness to be tempted brother BR said that's what God will do to you he'll give you an injection of the Holy Spirit and then let's see if if the diseases will harm you and of course the diseases won't harm you because you've got a greater power that's within you Hallelujah you're not going to get sick in the things of the world you've already got the in ction Hallelujah you've got the inoculation you've got the power Hallelujah to keep you from sin oh thank God Amen for the injection of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things don't mind honor and riches this is a church that battled pride and no doubt because there in Rome it was the richest the richest Kingdom of the world just lot like America right but condescend or yield yourself submit oneself to lowly things I've said this before but church if you see somebody that don't have anybody to talk to go talk to them and you know nobody wants to talk to that person condescend humble yourself and go talk to that person just show them some love right happens all the time at school I I'm able to smile at kids wave at kids see how they're doing right I've done that other church fellowships I've seen that you know when I preach to other churches I'll go sit with the people I won't sit with the preacher sometimes I'll sit with the people that don't have anybody sit with them right now sometimes the preacher wants you to sit by them right because you are their guest but the Bible tells us this is Christianity submit yourself to people that you see they're less fortunate than you to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits like those Walmart workers I'll stop and talk to them some people will just walk right by them I'll talk and say yes sir how you doing God bless you talk about Jesus right these are the low people these are the lowest people we'd say you know they're they're not making millions of dollars working in Walmart wish you could verse 17 recompense uh to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men Hallelujah so again honesty not returning evil for evil so turning the other cheek as Jesus said right giving love when they've given you hate this is the Christian Life if it be possible everybody say possible possible sometimes it's not possible as much as lith in you live peaceably with all men just try to bring peace to the situation and church it's very easy I've seen it many times just humble yourself and say you're sorry even if you didn't do anything and they misunderstood just say I'm sorry if I did that I'm sorry if if I hurt your feelings and you know no you didn't but if it brings peace Hallelujah for peace that's what we need the Bible said let's have peace within our gates in other words let's have peace in our homes this is the last La yeah last last uh scriptures here musicians going to come let me finish with this let's stand to our feet I'm just going to finish the chapter dearly beloved look what he calls him you're my you're my dearly beloved I think that means apple of my eye if I'm not mistaken in the Greek dear dearly beloved he's writing to the dearly beloved Saints in Rome avenge not don't punish people that have mistreated you don't punish them right we're all tempted to get revenge this person said this well look what I'm going to say right this person stole from me look what I'm going to do to them don't punish people but rather and don't give Place unto wrath like I've told you this before different family members they get so bottled up in different friends and co-workers I've had they'll get so bowled up they'll just explode then they'll be like oh I feel better now well of course because you just you poured out your wrath but you shouldn't do that you shouldn't keep you shouldn't Harbor all those evil spirits you should cast them on the Lord amen cast your cares on the Lord for he cares for you Hallelujah it is written vengeance is mine God will pay these people back I will repay sayeth the Lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him so if there's any enemy if anyone's going against you now try to feed them if he thirst give him drink for in doing so Thou shalt reap coals of fire on his head here's what this means it means this is proverbial when you do a favor on your enemy the memory in him of his own wrong gives him pain like there's l five coals burning on his head anybody ever felt that as a child maybe your sibling was nice to you and you were mean to them anybody ever feel that before I felt that right whenever I whenever I've done something wrong whenever I've whenever I've sinned or whatever and I know and someone some good happens to me it's like like you feel this hotness on your head am I the only one out there am might be the only one okay well at least I'm in the Bible by God's grace Hallelujah but when you you do good to those that do evil it's like pulling it's like pouring live coals on their head you've seen it on cartoons right that's what it is and it it makes them remember that's right I did Evil to you and you're doing good to me and it makes them upset that's what the Bible says now this is not the kind of coal we want we don't want the coal on our our head we want the coal on our tongue like just struck me right now just like when it struck Isaiah God said who will go for me and the Bible said God an angel took a live coal from the altar this was a holy coal Hallelujah and that Holy Co touched his lips he said now my lips are clean he said here am I send me Jesus amen that's what we need coals Hallelujah we need the fire of God in our lips Hallelujah we don't want to take wrath on other people we don't want to take revenge on people we want the fire of God in our lips so we have clean words our mouth is cleaned out with the Holy Spirit praise God Hallelujah the Bible said no man can tame the tongue only the Holy Ghost contain the tongue Hallelujah do not punish for other people for their mistakes towards uh towards you and I God will repay be not overcome with evil but overcome evil with good there's I used to sing that song in Sunday School always wonder why am I singing this and now I know Hallelujah I know I'm going to choose one of the other I'm going to let either power take me over the church said you're either going to let evil evil take you over and just let evil fuel your life or you're going to let the Holy Spirit F fuel your life amen hallelujah I'm G to be o I'm either going to be overcome with evil or overcome with God's spirit hallelujah oh let's yield our spirits to God hallelujah let's have a transform mind Hallelujah where our minds are transformed and our lives are patterned after the Christian Life Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 6:12 this is a verse I Ed when I overcome tobacco you probably got it memorized now I didn't know I told him Christ I said I don't know how I'll ever quit chewing tobacco but I saw this I saw this man he lost his jaw from chewing tobacco and I I hung that up as a warning to me and I wrote 1 Corinthians 6:12 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient but I will not be brought under the power of any and I read that verse Mercy every day and I started saying I'm not going to be brought under the power of this thing now I was but I was talking like I wasn't I was like Abraham calling those things not as though they were hallelujah praise God Amen I look at that little that tobacco can I said I will not be brought under the power of you now what's your tobacco can today hallelujah it's probably not a tobacco can but something that you're struggling with with say devil I will not be brought under the power of that I'm going to get a transform mine so I can do the will of God today amen let's bow our heads here father God we thank you for today Lord God thank you for these powerful verses Lord this chapter caus a
