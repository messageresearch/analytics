[18:06] to say to us to see them if you would
[18:09] standard once all the minute just get

[18:28] me to proverbs chapter twenty five
[18:31] thirty point eight also in proverbs
[18:52] twenty five twenty eight it says he that
[18:56] hath no rule over his own spirit is like
[18:59] a city that has broken down and without
[19:02] walls James 4:17 says therefore to him
[19:09] that knoweth that knoweth to do good do
[19:15] with it not to him that knoweth to do
[19:19] good and do with it not to him
[19:29] Thanksgiving is humility in our heart

[20:49] questioning their walk with you and
[20:50] wonder if they should step away we just
[20:52] we just want to try to head those things
[20:54] off and try to encourage a soldier of
[20:56] the cross to continue on and and to
[20:59] fight the good fight of faith so Lord
[21:01] with with your help we just do that
[21:03] tonight father we ask it your precious
[21:05] name our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[21:07] it may be seated thank you for your
[21:12] attention this morning Oh y'all are
[21:15] always a good group to come and talk to
[21:20] let's turn to First Samuel chapter 15
[21:29] I'm just going to kind of talk a little
[21:31] bit on try not to preach it too much
[21:35] just just want
[21:38] kind of talk to you like we were sitting
[21:40] in my living room just talked to you for
[21:42] a little bit just like we were sitting
[21:43] down kind of like a Bible study type
[21:46] type deal First Samuel chapter 15 and 24
[21:53] it says and Saul said unto Samuel I have
[21:58] sinned
[21:59] for I have transgressed the commandment
[22:01] of the Lord in thy words because I
[22:04] feared the people and obeyed their voice
[22:07] now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin
[22:10] and turning in with me that I may
[22:12] worship the Lord and Samuel said unto
[22:15] Saul I will not return with thee for
[22:18] thou has rejected the word of the lord
[22:20] and the lord hath rejected thee from
[22:22] being king over israel now beforehand if
[22:27] you know the story which every Bible
[22:29] reader should know the story is that
[22:30] Saul was specifically told to slay
[22:34] everything all the Amalekites all the
[22:37] all the goats all the sheep and not keep
[22:39] anything he was supposed to destroy all
[22:41] and which he did not so he had a
[22:45] specific instructions and he didn't obey
[22:47] Anna as we read in James 4:17 therefore
[22:50] to him that knoweth to do good it's all
[22:52] new to perform a specific order he knew
[22:55] he should have carried it out but and do
[22:59] with it not to him it is sin so when
[23:02] Samuel had confronted him with this
[23:04] wrong saw knew that he did wrong he knew
[23:07] it but he was just afraid of what the
[23:09] people was what they were going to think
[23:12] as he said I feared the people and
[23:15] obeyed their voice instead of giving God
[23:18] the honor just like we were talking
[23:19] about Eli and his sons that he was more
[23:22] concerned about his sons he doesn't you
[23:24] could kind of take it how you want but
[23:26] you can kind of view it as as I he
[23:29] didn't want to hurt their feelings or he
[23:31] didn't want to get in an uproar over but
[23:33] it it is said in the scripture which we
[23:35] didn't read it that that Eli had given
[23:37] more honor unto his sons than then under
[23:40] God which we know that honor should be
[23:42] bestowed upon God you know we ought to
[23:45] honor God more than brothers and sisters
[23:48] and and prophets evangelists you know
[23:50] God
[23:51] is the one that needs to be honored
[23:52] above all for he is king of kings and
[23:55] the Lord of lords he is all and above
[23:57] all and the creator of all so we should
[23:59] always put the praise and thanksgiving
[24:00] up above to exalt God amen and I pray
[24:06] that that will always be my song is that
[24:08] I will give God praise I praise itself
[24:10] that's always my desire and I wouldn't
[24:11] fall short of that being far from us
[24:14] that we would give more honor unto unto
[24:17] man that is only here as a vapor been Oh
[24:22] a little while back I was I was having
[24:26] some issues that I wanted to discuss
[24:29] with with some people unfortunately I
[24:33] didn't I didn't get to discuss those
[24:35] issues because I do it would start a
[24:41] conflict I do or at least I think I know
[24:47] sometimes you think you know something
[24:49] you're afraid to do something because
[24:51] you think it's going to have a certain
[24:53] turn out and that sometimes you do that
[24:55] it has a completely different turn out
[24:57] that what you thought so I had some
[25:01] predetermined thoughts that things were
[25:03] going to go a certain way so that's why
[25:05] I didn't want to talk to discuss those
[25:08] issues because I don't like to argue
[25:11] except it fits in with my own family of
[25:14] course that's I generally don't like to
[25:18] argue especially over Scripture I don't
[25:23] I don't like confrontation I don't like
[25:26] contention I don't I don't like conflict
[25:32] not to say that I can't handle it but I
[25:34] just don't like those situations and I
[25:38] generally get nervous because I know
[25:41] I've seen what it can turn into so I
[25:45] like to discuss things we can discuss
[25:48] the scripture some people like to argue
[25:50] and debate Scripture and if you don't
[25:53] see it their way they get pretty heated
[25:55] and if you don't see it their way you're
[25:58] going to hell and I just don't like
[26:01] those kind of confrontations because it
[26:04] doesn't really
[26:06] it's not beneficial it's not edifying I
[26:09] meant so when I get what I get defensive
[26:14] I get pretty angry so I try to stay away
[26:19] from that because I don't like the
[26:21] spirit of anger upon me because
[26:22] sometimes when people get angry they
[26:24] they're they're you're out of your mind
[26:26] and some people just don't know what
[26:27] they're doing and they take things a
[26:29] little too far whether it gets to
[26:31] fisticuffs fighting or just like Cain
[26:36] and Abel you know ends up in killing one
[26:38] another but uh one night brother Jim was
[26:48] ministering and I thought it just struck
[26:52] me I thought wow how true that is and so
[26:57] I wrote it down and I just write my
[26:58] notes down of what might possibly
[27:01] possibly preach on or were to discuss
[27:03] with you know just have a topic of
[27:05] discussion with with people and so I
[27:09] want to share that thought with you
[27:10] tonight we were around a campfire I
[27:13] didn't think that it would amount to
[27:14] much and our Labor Day meetings we had a
[27:17] campfire testimony service and people
[27:19] were testifying I was thinking about
[27:20] there wasn't really anything great that
[27:24] had happened I can't think of any
[27:25] testimony I just couldn't think of it
[27:29] not that nothing happened you know
[27:30] within the family even a even a healing
[27:33] of sicknesses of testimony for us and
[27:35] you know we appreciate those things but
[27:37] I couldn't think of anything all that
[27:40] kept coming to my mind was this thought
[27:42] and a brother had said one time he said
[27:47] you know I've learned that when I'm
[27:51] sitting here and I feel that I should
[27:53] say something and I I sit here and I
[27:56] battle with it I'm not going to say
[27:58] anything I'm not going to say anything
[27:59] but something keeps pushing what just go
[28:01] ahead and say he said you know I found
[28:04] out when I when I eventually said I give
[28:07] it and I say it that somebody says I
[28:09] absolutely needed that thank you so much
[28:11] for sharing that that has really helped
[28:13] me he said that uh that's what that's
[28:15] when he learned that he should just say
[28:17] it anyways
[28:18] there's a because it might help somebody
[28:20] so that feeling that you have to try to
[28:23] hold back that's probably not the Holy
[28:25] Spirit trying to hold you back trying to
[28:27] help somebody
[28:28] man so that's the other fellow that's
[28:30] probably trying to hold you from helping
[28:33] somebody Amen but what I'd like to speak
[28:36] on I'll talk to you about tonight as a
[28:39] fear of conflict causes compromise we
[28:46] might try to avoid conflict and in a
[28:48] pieces situation so it doesn't get out
[28:50] of control because if you've gotten into
[28:53] some heated discussions some people get
[28:56] out of control it's like a defense
[29:02] mechanism when when people get
[29:05] uncomfortable you know I've heard it
[29:07] said that you know people get
[29:11] uncomfortable when you I don't know how
[29:14] they could say this you know if there's
[29:16] another when there's an elephant in the
[29:17] room you know if people are
[29:18] uncomfortable talking about the elephant
[29:19] in the room
[29:20] yeah and it's something big and
[29:22] noticeable but nobody wants to discuss
[29:24] it
[29:25] so some there are some topics out there
[29:28] that are uncomfortable talking about if
[29:31] you see somebody that you are doing
[29:34] something that you don't exactly agree
[29:36] with you kind of feel I don't really
[29:39] want to talk about it you know but it's
[29:41] okay to confront somebody with something
[29:44] look I disagree with what you did you
[29:47] know so you don't have to go and yell
[29:51] with them in their face and and you know
[29:54] just put them down but there's there's a
[29:55] way that you can go and talk to people
[29:58] you know some people are really good at
[30:00] it probably sales salesmen those are
[30:01] good salesmen you know this can put you
[30:04] down in a nice way but it's on how you
[30:08] on how you deal with people it's like
[30:12] people that I work with we have some
[30:14] apprentices and I just feel humbled when
[30:18] they tell me I'm glad I got to work with
[30:20] you I told one fellow I said you know
[30:24] you did a good job today I appreciate
[30:26] you doing a good job and doing what you
[30:30] did
[30:31] you did a good job he said coming from
[30:33] you that means something what do you
[30:35] mean he said cuz other guys and we might
[30:38] not do anything all day and then they
[30:40] tell me at the end of the day that good
[30:42] job well we didn't do anything but I've
[30:47] had a couple tell me that they part me
[30:50] out I don't mean to lift myself up by
[30:51] any means but I'm just trying to
[30:52] illustrate that I need a couple tell me
[30:57] that they'd like to work with me because
[30:59] I try to show them things and I try to
[31:01] teach them something and if we have some
[31:03] down time I try to take them to
[31:06] something else to try to show them and
[31:08] instead of just sitting there doing
[31:09] nothing because you're not gonna learn
[31:11] anything doing nothing right staring at
[31:14] the wall you just learned what color the
[31:16] wall is you know what pattern is on the
[31:18] wall and that that's all you're going to
[31:19] do but what I'm getting we need
[31:21] challenged a meant is we need something
[31:25] to come against us sometimes we need a
[31:28] little conflict in our lives we need
[31:30] something to get us out of our comfort
[31:32] zone because one it's not that it's
[31:37] going to shake you from your faith but
[31:38] it's going to rattle you a little bit to
[31:40] find out it's going to let you know
[31:42] where you stand with the Lord if you're
[31:45] going to you know God tested the
[31:49] children of Israel as far as you know he
[31:52] would do different things and I can't
[31:54] remember if it's the numbers he's we're
[31:57] an exodus I can't remember which one it
[31:59] is but he said I tried you to see if you
[32:01] would stay with me to stay see if you
[32:03] would stay loyal to me so it's nice to
[32:07] have conflict it's not so nice when
[32:10] you're going through it but it's nice to
[32:12] know when somebody asks you why do you
[32:14] believe what you do why do you go to
[32:17] church and then you might get that
[32:18] uncomfortable while they're gonna try to
[32:20] rail me and bring all kinds of
[32:23] accusations and put me down and maybe
[32:25] they maybe they're genuinely asking
[32:26] because they they see something in your
[32:29] life and so sometimes people get
[32:31] defensive right away with that conflict
[32:33] is well that's a good question why do I
[32:36] believe what I why do I say I believe
[32:40] something or why do I stand for truth
[32:42] what truth am i standing up for
[32:45] what exactly do I go to church
[32:48] why don't I drink
[32:51] why don't I smoke why don't I go to
[32:54] clubs and the movie theater and the
[32:57] bowling alleys and and the different
[32:58] things that people were refrained from
[33:00] doing it's because you don't want to be
[33:02] in those atmospheres at least that
[33:03] that's my my reasoning I don't want to
[33:06] be in those type of atmosphere because I
[33:08] used to do those things and that's not
[33:12] to be entangled with being bondage and
[33:15] entangled with the yoke of bondage of
[33:17] what we were before so we try to shun
[33:22] the very appearance of evil and then so
[33:25] that's why I don't like to do those
[33:28] things brother Branham said you know I
[33:31] smoked all I want I drink all I want to
[33:33] do all these things I do all I want to
[33:35] do but I don't want to do those things
[33:38] the Lord has taken that desire from ease
[33:40] so I don't want to be as a dog returning
[33:44] back to his vomit so when somebody asks
[33:48] you about Trinity or why don't you see
[33:52] the Trinity the way that they do or why
[33:54] don't you see
[33:55] the rapture is pre-trib or post-trib
[33:58] whichever they they believe or wherever
[33:59] you stand or however you sit why don't
[34:03] you see it the same way that I do it's
[34:05] going to check you to see what you
[34:07] actually believe but like I said we we
[34:13] may try to avoid that kind of conflict
[34:16] too because if you know people that try
[34:19] to argue it and argue it and put you
[34:23] down with it you're going to be a little
[34:26] bit more defensive but when we do that
[34:30] when you have that fear of conflict you
[34:33] tend to compromise on the way on where
[34:35] you stand because you don't want to
[34:39] explain how you believe or because of a
[34:42] fear of something coming back at you or
[34:44] somebody railing against you do you see
[34:46] what I'm trying to say is when you had
[34:48] that fear that you don't want to
[34:50] confront the truth or make the error or
[34:53] to try to correct the error
[34:55] sometimes people compromise because if
[34:58] you don't
[34:59] correct something if you see somebody
[35:01] robbing a bank and you don't say hey you
[35:04] shouldn't be robbing a bank then and
[35:06] you're there you don't try to stop it
[35:07] you're you're kind of like an accomplice
[35:09] I mean not not exactly I mean you're not
[35:11] going to get charged for being
[35:12] accomplished but if there's something
[35:13] that you could have done to avoid it
[35:16] then you have become a part of it
[35:19] I can't think of the scripture now but
[35:22] there is a scripture about not partaking
[35:24] of the things that they do in the
[35:26] darkness you know I don't think people
[35:32] like conflict because they don't want to
[35:35] offend people maybe people like
[35:43] offending others so maybe that's why
[35:45] they like conflict but I just think that
[35:49] it's it's better to to be upfront and to
[35:56] show where you stand to be bold and and
[36:02] speak the truth speak of why I mean if
[36:07] there's a Bob Harrod woman that's
[36:09] somebody that's that cuts her hair a
[36:12] woman that cuts our hair and she'd be in
[36:14] the room or something and and they ask
[36:16] why don't you cut your hair and well I
[36:19] don't want to offend you you know but go
[36:21] ahead and say it because you can say it
[36:23] in love there you know so if you're
[36:26] going to stand for something stand for
[36:28] it but if you if you fall you're gonna
[36:30] fall for anything
[36:31] hey man so we've got to have a backbone
[36:35] in this in this day you've got to stand
[36:40] for something what is conflict everybody
[36:50] knows what conflict is I'm sure just to
[36:53] kind of give definition a little bit
[36:54] it's a state of disagreement or
[36:58] disharmony between persons or ideas or a
[37:02] clash to fight or to contend it's a
[37:06] battle or it's a warfare it compromise
[37:12] compromise is a weakening or reduction
[37:16] of one's principles or standards I was
[37:26] getting a an infusion uh in August it
[37:34] was a little bit ago anyway and the
[37:36] night nurse practitioner that was
[37:38] administering the infusion uh that I
[37:42] battled Crohn's disease I'm not going to
[37:44] say I have Crohn's disease I'm not going
[37:47] to say I suffer from Crohn's disease but
[37:49] I battle Crohn's disease because I don't
[37:52] want it there it doesn't belong here so
[37:54] I don't want it and but she had I told
[38:03] her some things that some of the things
[38:06] that I was going through and she decided
[38:08] to get a little bit adamant about
[38:10] telling me that I have a certain disease
[38:12] she's like getting in my face and you
[38:14] have such a such as ease you have such a
[38:16] such disease and she said it like three
[38:18] times in a row and I didn't really like
[38:20] that but the way that I the way you know
[38:28] why do people make that personal like
[38:30] it's a license plate or something or
[38:31] like like it's my pet dog you know and
[38:35] they say well how's your Crohn's well
[38:36] it's not my Crohn's for one thing and
[38:38] second of all we don't get along very
[38:40] well and I want to give it back you know
[38:44] we don't have a good relationship I
[38:46] don't like it and but it wants to stay
[38:47] on me it's kind of like one of those
[38:49] ankle-biting dogs that love you no
[38:51] matter what they'll follow you anywhere
[38:53] but I don't how battling it so that's
[38:58] all I'm gonna say is I I keep giving I
[39:00] keep giving it back where it belongs and
[39:02] I just keep giving back to the devil but
[39:05] I just never understood why people well
[39:08] how is your Crohn's like I put my name
[39:10] plate on it like I wanted it you know I
[39:13] got dibs I didn't do that you know it
[39:16] wasn't my choice well when I converse
[39:21] with people I tend to I tend to nod my
[39:23] head and say yeah
[39:25] because I'd like to keep the flow of
[39:26] conversation going and let the person
[39:29] know that I'm paying attention to what
[39:31] you're saying you know okay yeah so he
[39:33] says where she told me you have such a
[39:36] such disease and I'm sure yeah you know
[39:39] wait a minute that's not what I meant
[39:41] you know I wasn't shaking my head in
[39:43] agreeance so I was fueling that in my
[39:45] heart and that's not how I feel and
[39:47] immediately I just went to the Lord and
[39:49] you know I was thinking of my mind and
[39:50] praying on my heart Lord that is not
[39:52] what I meant I did not want to confess
[39:55] to this disease that I had this that I
[39:58] had this disease I did not want that
[40:00] confession so in my heart I always
[40:01] checked right away lord I did not mean
[40:03] that you know please forgive me if I
[40:06] gave a negative confession but where I
[40:08] made a mistake was is I didn't correct
[40:11] the error - this - Beth is her name I
[40:15] didn't make a correction to that because
[40:18] I I felt that it was going to lead to
[40:22] conflict you know because she's not a I
[40:25] had already given a testimony excuse me
[40:28] I've had to experience with her already
[40:32] but I testified of how the Lord took
[40:35] cigarettes away from me and she's she
[40:40] combated it with well if you want to
[40:42] quit something if a person wants to quit
[40:44] they can quit no you don't understand
[40:45] because I wanted to quit I tried to quit
[40:48] and I couldn't quit no matter how much I
[40:51] wanted to quit because I had butts on my
[40:55] garage floor that I would go back if I
[40:58] tried to quit I might made it a day but
[40:59] that next day I was back in the garage
[41:01] trying to take a hit off that cigarette
[41:03] or something now I was trying to find
[41:05] something to ease that craving I tried
[41:07] cigars I tried candy nitride snuff but I
[41:10] tried almost everything except
[41:11] acupuncture and medication with some of
[41:15] that stuff out there isn't very good
[41:16] I've heard chantix you know give some
[41:19] people nightmares and it makes some
[41:21] people think they're in paradise so it
[41:22] it's kind of playing roulette with with
[41:25] something like that but but one day
[41:27] April April 19th of 2002 was the last
[41:31] day I ever had a cigarette and to me
[41:32] that was a miracle I don't care what any
[41:35] doctor says yeah some people might have
[41:37] been able to quit but I couldn't
[41:39] I tried to quit and I wanted to quit
[41:41] because I didn't want to pay the money
[41:42] for it but I'm telling you what after
[41:44] after that April nineteenth day I was
[41:46] working midnight shift and and I bummed
[41:49] a cigarette off of a guy it would have
[41:52] been a couple days later I had have had
[41:54] to crave a much lissa a week you know so
[41:58] within a week a week's time I couldn't
[42:01] stand the smell of cigarette smoke which
[42:03] before it would have stirred up the
[42:05] craving to make me want one so to me
[42:08] that was a miracle now that nobody's
[42:10] gonna talk me out of that with you
[42:12] anyways so I had already had a
[42:14] confrontation with her before I mean it
[42:17] wasn't I knew that she was going to
[42:20] continue to stay in her ground and I was
[42:22] going to stay in my ground because I
[42:23] wasn't gonna get shaken because it
[42:24] happened to me I was there when it
[42:26] happened so that's something when you
[42:29] could have that experience as you can
[42:30] remember you could point back to that
[42:32] that happened to me
[42:34] Amen but uh this is another situation
[42:43] now I was thinking about along with
[42:47] wanting to talk about people was the
[42:49] listener nurse practitioner Beth that I
[42:54] have felt that I had compromised on my
[42:57] stand with my confession of healing
[43:00] because I didn't want to I didn't want
[43:04] to engage in that conflict so to me by
[43:09] not saying anything that was agreeing
[43:11] with that you see what I mean now if I'm
[43:16] confusing you I apologize I God's not
[43:18] the author of confusion so I don't want
[43:21] to I don't want to be the confusion so
[43:28] because I didn't battle that and correct
[43:30] that I just felt that I had compromised
[43:33] and it just made me sick in my heart you
[43:36] know my heart just sunk I can't believe
[43:38] I did that I should have said something
[43:40] to combat not that I want a contentious
[43:45] spirit I don't I don't like that I used
[43:47] to be like that I don't I don't want to
[43:49] be like that again
[43:50] again the scripture says be not a tank
[43:52] with the yoke of bondage again but some
[43:59] people are just timid they're their meat
[44:00] they're quiet not having a contentious
[44:03] spirit right I can't help but think of
[44:06] piglet you know if you've seen Winnie
[44:08] the Pooh piglets that real meek and
[44:10] timid a little creature but I'm not
[44:14] saying that we should be training as
[44:16] cage fighters either but dialled oh
[44:20] brother jewel for me no brother jewel
[44:24] forty told a story at one time or if he
[44:27] would pray for somebody he would say if
[44:29] I brought you a box of rattlesnakes
[44:31] would you accept that box of
[44:32] rattlesnakes would you accept a box of
[44:35] rattlesnakes would you accept a box box
[44:38] around snakes
[44:39] Malakai no I wouldn't accept the box of
[44:42] rattlesnakes so why would I accept the
[44:44] confession of a disease I don't want to
[44:47] accept that I also think of Shamgar
[44:53] Shamgar he only took so much from the
[44:57] Philistines according to the story of
[44:59] according to the version that brother
[45:02] Branham gives because there's only a
[45:04] small portion of Scripture it doesn't
[45:07] describe Shamgar very well only that he
[45:10] slew 600-650 I can't remember the amount
[45:14] of what it was about Philistines but
[45:19] brother brother branham went on to tell
[45:22] the story of how they would come an army
[45:25] would come of so many men and would take
[45:29] their harvest every year and do whatever
[45:32] else that the army wanted to do and
[45:33] there was nothing Shamgar could could do
[45:35] about it
[45:36] until one day now if you notice we are
[45:38] weak until the Lord shows up and I just
[45:42] see that in the Old Testament Saints and
[45:44] and even even the New Testament Saints
[45:47] well all of them all of them were weak
[45:49] until the Lord showed up so the Lord
[45:52] well he promised to go and fight the
[45:55] battle for us is that right so he told
[45:58] that to get in he told that to two other
[46:01] men of faith said I will go before you
[46:06] I can't remember where where it was but
[46:08] I've been thinking about the there's a
[46:13] picture hanging up in here about the
[46:14] different names of God and and one is
[46:17] the strength of Israel they call him the
[46:19] strength of Israel and I never caught
[46:20] that before until I think it was today I
[46:22] was reading through reading through the
[46:24] Bible and it was capitalized strength
[46:26] you know that he is the the strength of
[46:27] Israel but we are weak until he shows up
[46:30] when we allow him to have his way what's
[46:32] going to stand in our way he said what
[46:34] what weapon formed against these shall
[46:35] prosper
[46:38] but of how Shamgar he can only take he
[46:42] only took so much of about the the
[46:45] pilfering and the pillaging as a he had
[46:49] enough so we don't have to sit in a
[46:53] corner and let people bully us and we
[46:55] don't have to sit in the corner and uh
[46:57] just people tell us that we're worthless
[47:00] and tell people that our Bible is dead
[47:02] that our God is dead that this Bible is
[47:04] a myth our God is a myth we don't have
[47:06] to stand in a corner and take that kind
[47:08] of you're only going to take so much
[47:10] event until you could stand okay I can't
[47:17] think of that that term now your
[47:19] righteous indignation comes up and that
[47:21] you stand for truth it's okay to stand
[47:24] for truth amen
[47:25] but if you if you back an animal in a
[47:28] corner and they feel threatened they go
[47:31] into a defensive mode to try to survive
[47:34] you try that with a dog you try to
[47:36] corner a dog or raccoon or something and
[47:39] you try to get them you know I'm I'm
[47:41] saying not a not a tame dog I mean
[47:43] you're gonna be able to go get your
[47:45] little pooch in the corn you know I'm
[47:47] saying you try to let's use a wild
[47:50] animal like a raccoon or a possum and
[47:52] yeah or skunk and you try to get one of
[47:54] those you back them up at a corner and
[47:55] you're gonna be surprised even a
[47:57] groundhog the groundhog can get pretty
[47:59] uh big run or get pretty violent because
[48:03] it's a survival mode with with the
[48:05] animal kingdom but we don't have to we
[48:11] don't have to take that kind of abuse
[48:12] duh but I think of I it seems like I'm
[48:19] kind of getting
[48:20] I want to move on I want to progress
[48:22] here so I think of brothers and sisters
[48:24] that have that have left the faith and I
[48:27] I really want to go talk to them I want
[48:30] to persuade them back and but it's a
[48:33] mind battle to me to go talk to them
[48:36] because like I said I don't like the
[48:38] contention but we don't have to cower in
[48:40] fear we've been taught that brother
[48:43] Branham tardis said that faith has
[48:44] muscles on faith has muscles that we
[48:48] come boldly to the throne of God man so
[48:51] we don't have to kneel an oppression
[48:53] just because we get a little
[48:55] uncomfortable doesn't mean we have to
[48:56] compromise with our faith to fit in but
[49:01] uh I just think of let's you could turn
[49:03] to Matthew 26 69 I apologize I kind of
[49:08] feel like I'm rambling Matthew 26 what I
[49:23] want to say is we don't have to feel bad
[49:25] when we do fall if we do find ourselves
[49:28] in that condition you don't have to beat
[49:30] yourself up though because even Peter
[49:33] did he did the same thing Matthew 26 and
[49:37] 69 it says now Peter sat without in the
[49:40] palace and a damsel came unto him saying
[49:43] now also what's with Jesus of Galilee
[49:45] but he denied before them all saying I
[49:48] know not what thou sayest and when he
[49:52] was gone out into the porch another maid
[49:54] saw him and said unto them that that
[49:56] were there this fellow was also with
[49:58] Jesus of Nazareth and again he denied
[50:01] with an oath I do not know the man and
[50:04] after a while came unto Him they that
[50:08] stood by and said to Peter surely thou
[50:10] also are one of them for thy speech be
[50:13] wrathy which that means that your speech
[50:15] is showing who you are because you talk
[50:17] like it's being made manifest of of who
[50:20] you are then began he to curse and to
[50:24] swear saying I know not the man and
[50:26] immediately the crew and Peter
[50:28] remembered the word the word of Jesus
[50:30] which said unto him before the crow
[50:32] thou shalt deny me
[50:34] thrice and he went out went out and wept
[50:37] bitterly now there's an issue if we deny
[50:41] Christ and we continue on in that same
[50:44] condition but there's a difference when
[50:48] you catch yourself like Peter did here
[50:50] he went outside and he realized what had
[50:53] happened and he wept bitterly now so see
[50:57] if you can repent not a dry eye
[50:59] confession well well I'm sorry you know
[51:01] just whatever no but if you really mean
[51:04] it if you're really sincere you're
[51:06] weeping within yourself or weeping on
[51:08] the outside whatever it is you can weep
[51:10] bitterly in repentance saying lord I
[51:12] didn't mean that I don't want that kind
[51:14] of a spirit on me I don't want to deny
[51:16] you because the scripture tells us if
[51:18] you deny him he's going to done deny you
[51:21] now I don't want to be that in that way
[51:24] again here's a story with Peter it's and
[51:27] Galatians two and verse seven I'm gonna
[51:34] go I'm gonna read seven and then skip to
[51:36] eleven because I just want to establish
[51:38] something in verse seven well it's
[51:40] already established but I just want to
[51:41] point it out but contrariwise when they
[51:46] saw that the gospel of the
[51:47] uncircumcision was committed on to me as
[51:49] the gospel of the circumcision was unto
[51:52] Peter excuse me I yeah I did say it's a
[51:56] story about Peter but Paul is saying
[51:59] that he is called to the uncircumcision
[52:02] and Peter was called to the circumcision
[52:05] so just establishing that adversity
[52:08] lemon it says but when Peter was come to
[52:11] Antioch I withstood him to the face
[52:13] because he was to be blamed for before
[52:16] that certain came from James he did eat
[52:18] with the Gentiles but when they were
[52:21] come he withdrew and separated himself
[52:23] fearing them which were the circumcision
[52:28] see the fear of the conflict fear of
[52:30] being railed on he separated himself and
[52:34] he went with the circumcision which it
[52:36] which is of the Jews and the other Jews
[52:40] dissembled likewise with him insomuch
[52:42] that Barnabas also was carried away with
[52:45] their dissimulation or
[52:47] that means their hypocrisy or their
[52:50] deceitfulness at verse 14 it says but
[52:55] when I saw that they walked not
[52:57] uprightly according to the truth of the
[52:59] gospel not according to his opinion but
[53:03] according to the truth of the gospel I
[53:05] said unto Peter before them all if thou
[53:08] being a jew live after the manner of
[53:10] gentiles and not as do the jews why
[53:13] compel us thou the gentiles to live as
[53:16] do the jews so he's trying to Paul saw
[53:23] what they were teaching that part that
[53:25] Peter was teaching falsely and living in
[53:27] hypocrisy at that point in time is uh
[53:29] trying to appease the Jews and trying to
[53:32] appease their opinion but he was wanting
[53:34] the Gentiles to do the same as his Jews
[53:36] when he's telling the Gentiles and it
[53:38] doesn't matter so he's kind of talking
[53:41] out of both sides of his mouth to try to
[53:43] appease the different groups that's kind
[53:45] of the way that I think about it but
[53:51] what I want to get at is Paul had no
[53:53] problem confronting Peter about this
[53:55] situation because Paul was just a it was
[53:58] a bold man to begin with he wasn't a
[54:00] pigley he wasn't a timid little creature
[54:07] so we know Paul didn't compromise to try
[54:10] to save Peters feelings maybe he didn't
[54:14] care if it hurt his feelings or not a
[54:15] matter of fact I think he wanted to hurt
[54:17] his feelings to get him into the truth
[54:18] to get him back according to the truth
[54:21] of the gospel and I don't want to talk
[54:26] just kind of give another example
[54:29] there's a Exodus 32 in Chapter 1 excuse
[54:34] me 32 and verse 1 everybody okay this
[54:41] evening Exodus 32 and 1 it says and when
[54:53] the people saw that Moses delayed to
[54:55] come down out of the Mount the people
[54:58] gathered themselves together unto Aaron
[55:00] and said unto him up make us gods which
[55:04] shall go before us for as for this Moses
[55:11] the man that brought us up out of the
[55:13] land of Egypt we wot not what has become
[55:16] of him now we spoke earlier this morning
[55:18] about the servant that that was getting
[55:22] upset you know saying that the lord
[55:24] delayeth is coming I couldn't help but
[55:25] notice that I think I noticed that this
[55:28] mortar or something when I was looking
[55:29] at man is Moses there thinking that
[55:31] Moses is delaying his coming down from
[55:33] the mountain and uh how we talked about
[55:37] with it the evil certain servant when
[55:40] they see that the lord delays is coming
[55:42] that they start fighting and and start
[55:45] drinking and and and the different
[55:47] things so this is the same thing as I
[55:49] where Moses Moses delayed his coming and
[55:52] the people started to they wanted to
[55:54] worship other gods but I thought you
[55:59] know through impatience people will
[56:01] start to they start to fall away to to
[56:04] find something else to follow or worship
[56:06] you know they try to find something else
[56:08] like I was saying earlier that when we
[56:11] get cleaned out we got to fill it with
[56:15] God you know we got to fill that void
[56:16] with with something of righteousness but
[56:20] I thank God that there's something that
[56:21] keeps holding me amen there's there were
[56:26] times that I wanted to quit there were
[56:28] times that I didn't I didn't want to
[56:29] continue on you know it just felt like
[56:33] it was I wasn't getting anywhere just
[56:36] kind of stuck in a Retton you know like
[56:38] I said this morning that I've had I've
[56:41] had times I'm not even I'm not even
[56:43] worthy to beer you know what point is
[56:45] there to go on oh you know just the
[56:48] different mind battles and and if you
[56:49] let those mind battles hammer you and
[56:52] hammer you and hammer you you tend to
[56:55] believe it after a while if you don't
[56:56] combat that you're going to compromise
[56:59] and remember what compromise is is a
[57:04] weakening or a reduction of one's
[57:06] principles or standards so maintain the
[57:09] standard of righteousness amen
[57:15] then I was just second there's a
[57:18] scripture there you know when when the
[57:19] enemy comes in like a flood but I just
[57:21] I'm gonna try and stick to to the text
[57:23] of yeah yeah an errand said unto them
[57:28] verse 2 and Aaron said unto them break
[57:30] off the golden earrings which are in the
[57:31] in the ears of your wives of your sons
[57:34] and of your daughters and bring them
[57:36] unto me and all the people break off the
[57:38] golden earrings which were in their ears
[57:40] and brought them unto Aaron and he
[57:44] received them at their hand and fasted
[57:46] it with a graving tool after he had made
[57:50] it a molten calf and they said these be
[57:53] thy God's o Israel which brought thee up
[57:56] out of the land of Egypt and when Aaron
[57:59] saw it he built an altar before it and
[58:06] Aaron made a proclamation and said
[58:08] tomorrow is a feast to the Lord and it's
[58:12] capitalized Lord is capitalized so
[58:15] there's a difference there so he's not
[58:17] talking about the golden calf and they
[58:20] rose up early on the morrow and offered
[58:22] burnt offerings and brought peace
[58:24] offerings and the people sat down to eat
[58:26] and to drink and rose up to play like I
[58:32] said through people's impatience because
[58:34] they can't hold on for the time that's
[58:38] coming they can't hold on when they get
[58:41] impatient they don't see things
[58:43] happening of what they should they tend
[58:46] to follow us something else because they
[58:49] can't follow they're compromising their
[58:52] faith to follow something else which is
[58:56] it got a saving you know something
[58:58] that's going to cause them to fall for
[59:03] time say god I didn't want to be very
[59:05] lengthy tonight but I was good though
[59:09] that's Elijah in the 450 prophets of
[59:11] Baal you know just continue on but
[59:14] they're in John John chapter 9 and verse
[59:17] 19
[59:30] John nine and nineteen it says and they
[59:34] asked them saying is this your son who
[59:37] you say was born blind how then does he
[59:40] now see
[59:41] his parents answered them and said we
[59:43] know that this is our son and that he
[59:45] was born blind but by what means he now
[59:49] see if we know not or who hath opened
[59:52] his eyes we know not he is of age ask
[59:54] him he shall speak for himself
[59:57] these words spake his parents because
[59:59] they feared the Jews see because out of
[1:00:02] fear they compromised they chose not to
[1:00:05] say anything because I didn't want to
[1:00:07] get kicked out they were afraid of
[1:00:08] losing their meal King and I think it's
[1:00:10] how it was preaching no because they
[1:00:13] feared the Jews for the Jews had agreed
[1:00:15] already that if any man did confess that
[1:00:18] he was Christ he should be put out of
[1:00:20] the synagogue therefore said his parents
[1:00:23] he is of age ask him then again then
[1:00:28] again called they the man that was blind
[1:00:30] and said unto him give God the praise we
[1:00:33] know that this man is a sinner he
[1:00:35] answered and said whether he be a sinner
[1:00:37] or no I know not one thing I know that
[1:00:40] whereas I was blind now I see you know
[1:00:43] you couldn't take that away from him
[1:00:44] just like I was talking about cigarettes
[1:00:46] and stuff like that the drinking it and
[1:00:49] just my old life you can't take that
[1:00:51] away from me I'm not going to tell you
[1:00:53] that something else happened because to
[1:00:55] save your feelings and it's not
[1:00:56] happening so he was the same way I don't
[1:01:00] know one thing I know is I was blind now
[1:01:02] I see then said they to him again what
[1:01:06] did he do to thee or what did he to thee
[1:01:10] how opened he thine eyes he answered
[1:01:14] them I have told you already and you did
[1:01:16] not hear wherefore
[1:01:18] would you hear it again or why would you
[1:01:20] hear it again will you also be his
[1:01:22] disciples I like how he turns the tables
[1:01:24] on we know that God spake unto Moses as
[1:01:28] for this fellow we know not from whence
[1:01:31] he is the man answered and said unto
[1:01:33] them why herein is a marvellous thing
[1:01:36] they
[1:01:37] you know not from whence he is and yet
[1:01:39] he have opened my eyes now we know that
[1:01:43] God heareth not sinners but if any man
[1:01:46] be a worshipper of God and doeth His
[1:01:49] will him he hear it you know this guy
[1:01:52] isn't even a Pharisee or sad you see or
[1:01:54] well-educated person such as such as
[1:01:56] that and he could see this so see it
[1:01:58] comes to the simple you don't have to be
[1:02:01] a scholar to be able to see how God can
[1:02:03] move hey man oh
[1:02:08] the first 31 he says now we know that
[1:02:11] God heareth not sinners but if any man
[1:02:13] be a worshipper of God and do with his
[1:02:15] will him he here since the world began
[1:02:19] was it not her that any man opened the
[1:02:21] eyes of one that was born blind this is
[1:02:24] something new that people are seeing if
[1:02:27] this man were not of God he could do
[1:02:29] nothing see the confession in the
[1:02:32] testimony that this man has he's turned
[1:02:34] it from them railing on him to where
[1:02:36] he's preaching to them and they answered
[1:02:40] and said unto him that was altogether
[1:02:41] born in sins and dust south teach us and
[1:02:44] they cast him out they couldn't take it
[1:02:46] anymore because they're like I said they
[1:02:47] were trying to then this man maintained
[1:02:50] his profession for he was the one who
[1:02:53] was blind and they were trying to get it
[1:02:56] out of him what did he do did he do some
[1:02:57] kind of a magic thing that he getting is
[1:02:59] there some kind of a magic ointment of
[1:03:00] course it's not in there but but I'm
[1:03:03] just I'm just going on a pseudo means so
[1:03:08] they're looking for some other avenue to
[1:03:10] explain what happened and these are
[1:03:12] supposed to be the religious people that
[1:03:14] they they can't even see God to know
[1:03:16] that this has never happened before this
[1:03:18] is something new that we're seeing and
[1:03:20] if any man be a worshipper of God and do
[1:03:24] his will God's gonna honor that in here
[1:03:26] so this man is doing the works of God
[1:03:30] and you're trying to call him a sinner
[1:03:38] but the Pharisees kept pushing and
[1:03:40] pushing it wasn't this guy who kept
[1:03:42] pushing he answered and said why do you
[1:03:44] have to hear it again but it was the
[1:03:46] Pharisees that kept pushing and pushing
[1:03:48] and pushing and pushing and just like
[1:03:50] Shamgar Shamgar could
[1:03:51] they take so much he says up but he just
[1:03:54] he just spoke up he didn't fall apart
[1:03:57] under their pressure instead of getting
[1:03:59] under upset he preached to them and put
[1:04:02] them in their place
[1:04:03] then they got all embarrassed and
[1:04:05] they're the ones who got upset so he
[1:04:09] didn't compromise no matter what kind of
[1:04:10] pressure was to to get him to doubt he
[1:04:13] maintained his profession and that's
[1:04:17] what I want to and go through all this
[1:04:19] that's what I want to get at is don't
[1:04:21] compromise on your stance with God
[1:04:23] because somebody's trying to pressure
[1:04:24] you into doing something else I'm gonna
[1:04:33] bring this to a close but there's
[1:04:42] something not with just not just with
[1:04:49] other people there's a fear of conflict
[1:04:51] with oneself so what do you mean by well
[1:04:56] have you ever had the thought that well
[1:05:00] I've come this far now what's it matter
[1:05:02] if I'm if I continue on I've already
[1:05:04] committed the sin what's it whether you
[1:05:08] held a beer in your hand or you took a
[1:05:09] sip of beer why I've already come this
[1:05:11] far what's it going to hurt if I
[1:05:12] continue and just drink a six-pack or a
[1:05:15] 12-pack where do you stop if you know
[1:05:18] that what you're doing is wrong when you
[1:05:19] come whether it be on a website of a
[1:05:23] pornography or whatever it might be
[1:05:27] whatever how whatever the situation
[1:05:29] might be you might say to yourself and
[1:05:32] it's just a philosophy and it's just
[1:05:34] trying to be a justification to continue
[1:05:37] doing what you're doing but when you
[1:05:39] once you recognize I have a beer in my
[1:05:42] hand I'm not supposed to be drinking
[1:05:44] when you start thinking I'm already this
[1:05:46] far what's it gonna hurt and you finish
[1:05:48] that beer you could have said I've come
[1:05:52] this far I'm gonna stop I'm not gonna
[1:05:56] compromise my testimony I made a mistake
[1:05:59] I'm not going to continue in the mistake
[1:06:01] you can stop and repent repent means to
[1:06:04] turn
[1:06:05] go the other way right so you don't have
[1:06:09] to keep going when you get where you're
[1:06:13] not supposed to be you don't have to
[1:06:15] keep going you can stop and turn around
[1:06:17] I'm talking about temptation that's the
[1:06:20] that's it that's a conflict with oneself
[1:06:23] because it's a war against the flesh
[1:06:25] it's a flesh warring against the spirit
[1:06:27] it's warring against yourself because
[1:06:29] this flesh wants to experience a moment
[1:06:32] of pleasure whether it be adults or not
[1:06:37] that we want to do it but there are
[1:06:39] certain things that this flesh wants to
[1:06:41] wants to have so we war with the spirit
[1:06:46] that's within us because with my mind I
[1:06:48] follow Christ and I die out daily with
[1:06:52] my mind I follow Christ with my mind
[1:06:54] I'm having a mind battle I'm going to
[1:06:57] kick this thing out I'm gonna kick this
[1:06:58] desire out I don't want that desire here
[1:07:01] it doesn't belong here
[1:07:02] you don't have to harbor that if there's
[1:07:04] a bird coming to make a nest you don't
[1:07:06] have to let it make a nest there just
[1:07:08] because it lands doesn't mean that you
[1:07:09] have to let us sit there and make a nest
[1:07:11] you can knock that thing down but it's a
[1:07:15] war against the desires of the flesh but
[1:07:17] yeah what I what I want to get to is
[1:07:20] people tend to compromise with death
[1:07:23] thinking that it's better than their
[1:07:26] present situation which at that time
[1:07:29] seems hopeless to continue on which is
[1:07:33] suicide
[1:07:35] people tend to compromise with that they
[1:07:38] think that I'm not worth anything people
[1:07:40] might have told them well you're
[1:07:42] worthless you're useless nobody could
[1:07:45] use you nobody likes you you're ugly
[1:07:46] you're fat you're you're this I don't
[1:07:50] like being around you you I don't like
[1:07:52] the food that you eat I don't like this
[1:07:53] I don't like that people don't like to
[1:07:56] be told those things over and over and
[1:07:58] over and it gets people and despair it's
[1:07:59] better instead of speaking words of a
[1:08:02] doubt and discouragement and and uh
[1:08:05] trying to bring people down how about a
[1:08:07] word of encouragement we can combat
[1:08:09] those things by saying a soft answer
[1:08:11] turneth away wrath that's proverbs 15:1
[1:08:14] a soft answer turneth away wrath you
[1:08:16] don't have to let somebody beat somebody
[1:08:18] else down
[1:08:19] verbally you don't have to don't put
[1:08:23] people down because you put them in that
[1:08:24] in that spot of despair where they feel
[1:08:27] that and I'm not saying everybody but
[1:08:29] people there are some people that are
[1:08:31] not as emotionally stable as what you
[1:08:34] are there are some people that are for
[1:08:39] lack of better terms weak minded weak
[1:08:41] spirited that they can't come back
[1:08:43] they're different things on their own or
[1:08:46] they need to help with the pressures
[1:08:48] that come their way so what are these
[1:08:54] people they think that I'm not useful
[1:08:56] enough I'm not good enough what's the
[1:08:58] purpose of me to continue on which
[1:09:00] somebody knows that person so they don't
[1:09:03] think at that point time it's a
[1:09:05] selfishness because they think that
[1:09:07] nobody loves them and they don't take
[1:09:08] into account of how many people around
[1:09:11] them that do love them maybe they don't
[1:09:12] tell them enough you know if you have a
[1:09:14] father and a mother brother and sister
[1:09:16] tell them you love them it seems like
[1:09:21] anytime my sister comes on my mind
[1:09:23] recently not that I can't think of the
[1:09:30] term now but anytime and I would think
[1:09:34] about my sister and uh I would want to
[1:09:36] text her I wouldn't do it and then I
[1:09:37] would text her her her husband was hurt
[1:09:40] getting hurt somehow every time I would
[1:09:42] text well but it doesn't hurt when you
[1:09:46] have somebody come on your mind
[1:09:48] text them call them whatever it is send
[1:09:51] a leave a note form hey I appreciate you
[1:09:53] you know I thank you for doing such and
[1:09:56] such what's it gonna hurt to take five
[1:09:58] seconds of your time to say something
[1:10:00] nice to somebody or to encourage
[1:10:02] somebody a co-worker a neighbor whatever
[1:10:05] it might be it might take five seconds
[1:10:08] so what if they grumble and complain I
[1:10:10] had a guy that I worked with years ago
[1:10:12] he told me I needed to be shot
[1:10:14] we were working midnight shift and uh I
[1:10:17] was on a steady midnight shift at the
[1:10:19] time and and uh I got a little bit happy
[1:10:22] because it was getting close to the end
[1:10:23] of the shift and I think I was kind of
[1:10:25] bouncing around a little bit then and I
[1:10:27] was singing I was happy because I was
[1:10:29] getting ready to go home and uh
[1:10:31] sometimes when I get
[1:10:33] I get tired I get a little goofy anyway
[1:10:34] but this man he says you know what you
[1:10:38] ought to be shot what he said there's
[1:10:41] nobody in the right mind that should be
[1:10:43] that happy on a midnight shift like that
[1:10:47] well what's it gonna hurt to give a word
[1:10:49] of encouragement to somebody so what if
[1:10:51] they say something and then you say
[1:10:53] something encouraging again it's gonna
[1:10:55] wear on him eventually so where they're
[1:10:57] gonna accept that you know they're going
[1:10:59] to see that hopefully you mean it you
[1:11:01] know and not say just just to go through
[1:11:03] motions you know I want people to have a
[1:11:05] good day you tell people have a good day
[1:11:08] but we say it's so so empty sometimes
[1:11:12] because it's just filling words that we
[1:11:14] say is that it becomes a common thing
[1:11:17] okay have a good day and but do you
[1:11:19] really may not really I want you to have
[1:11:21] a good day I pray that you have a
[1:11:23] wonderful day I have pray that you have
[1:11:24] the most wonderful day you've had in
[1:11:26] years or ever have you know what's wrong
[1:11:28] with saying something like that but
[1:11:32] spiritual suicide
[1:11:33] what is suicide suicide is a separating
[1:11:39] oneself when we know that death is
[1:11:40] separation from God so that spiritual
[1:11:43] suicide but suicide is the act or an
[1:11:47] instance of intentionally killing
[1:11:49] oneself the destruction or ruin of one's
[1:11:53] own interests whether it be political
[1:11:54] whether it be managerial in a company or
[1:12:00] whatever it might be or one who commits
[1:12:02] suicide it means to kill oneself commit
[1:12:06] suicide relating to embalming or
[1:12:08] resulting in one's voluntary death now
[1:12:13] what do you mean you might ask what do
[1:12:15] you mean about spiritual suicide because
[1:12:17] suicide means to separate oneself
[1:12:20] voluntarily so when you withdraw
[1:12:23] yourself from fellowship you are
[1:12:26] committing spiritual suicide because
[1:12:28] when you withdraw yourself from
[1:12:30] fellowship you draw your you take the
[1:12:32] strength away iron sharpens iron when
[1:12:36] you don't when you're not fellowshipping
[1:12:38] with saints of like precious faith when
[1:12:40] you're out there a fellowship in with
[1:12:42] the world instead of and instead of
[1:12:44] other Christians you're gonna fall
[1:12:45] you're gonna come
[1:12:46] remise you're going to go the way of the
[1:12:48] world you're not going to go in the way
[1:12:50] of faith that's spiritual suicide when
[1:12:53] you decide that you're not going to
[1:12:54] serve God anymore you now withdrew
[1:12:56] yourself or withdrawn yourself from
[1:12:59] fellowship with God you know those are
[1:13:09] the people that have been falling away
[1:13:11] and I have seen people fall away almost
[1:13:14] like it's a plague and it hurts to see
[1:13:21] people fall away I could understand
[1:13:24] disagreeing on on certain things but
[1:13:26] when you take it seems like when people
[1:13:28] completely take themselves out of
[1:13:30] fellowship or let's say out of the
[1:13:33] message ranks or whatever it is they
[1:13:35] completely stop being a Christian all
[1:13:37] together not just not just falling away
[1:13:42] from the message but falling away from
[1:13:43] God completely I don't understand it but
[1:13:48] we know the scripture tells us that
[1:13:50] there will be a great falling away
[1:13:51] before the before he comes
[1:13:53] amen I kind of want to close with this
[1:13:57] as a everybody knows what a faucet is or
[1:14:00] a spigot I heard this analogy one time
[1:14:04] about a faucet excuse me a faucet is
[1:14:09] very useful brings us water you can wash
[1:14:13] your hands you can fill fill jugs up
[1:14:15] fill pots and pans or whatever you need
[1:14:17] to do bathe your children bathe yourself
[1:14:21] you know a faucet is very useful but
[1:14:24] it's absolutely useless an order for a
[1:14:27] faucet to work there has to be something
[1:14:29] behind it there has to be a power behind
[1:14:31] it in order to be a useful tool so if it
[1:14:34] has no power then it becomes useless it
[1:14:37] just sits there so are you gonna be a
[1:14:40] closed faucet or are you gonna make open
[1:14:42] faucet you're gonna have the power of
[1:14:43] the Holy Ghost behind you are you gonna
[1:14:46] withdrawing yourself from fellowship go
[1:14:49] ahead and stand your feet hope I could
[1:14:53] say something to help you this evening
[1:14:55] there was an article that I had read by
[1:14:59] the man
[1:15:00] his name is thank you with matches he
[1:15:04] had an article conflict is an
[1:15:06] opportunity for grace and he says
[1:15:10] something that he really stuck out the
[1:15:13] statement that he made said for the
[1:15:15] Christian conflict is not something to
[1:15:18] avoid or ignore it is an opportunity for
[1:15:23] the triumph of grace amen
[1:15:32] straight to Stephanie father or just
[1:15:36] talking with the people tonight not so
[1:15:39] much preaching but just lay it on what's
[1:15:42] been on my heart recently just some
[1:15:44] things that I've been going through it
[1:15:45] just praying it would be help to
[1:15:49] somebody here jumping shouting message
[1:15:54] nor it's just something from the heart
[1:15:56] as Esther just created your word that
[1:16:01] was spoken tonight
[1:16:02] just be embedded in the hearts of your
[1:16:04] people here tonight father and that they
[1:16:05] would go strengthened with the with the
[1:16:08] power of the mind of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:09] tonight and Lord the Spirit is withdrawn
[1:16:13] from the Lord I pray that you would give
[1:16:15] it a refreshing of that Holy Spirit
[1:16:16] tonight on God for more that is so
[1:16:18] important to have in this day we're a
[1:16:20] design watchtower it tells us when we're
[1:16:22] doing wrong it it gives us morning if
[1:16:24] we're going in the wrong direction it
[1:16:27] gives us a warning if something bad is
[1:16:29] going to happen it serves as many
[1:16:33] purposes and Lord we need your Holy
[1:16:35] Spirit in this day to keep this pure to
[1:16:38] keep the strong to so we can withstand
[1:16:41] the wiles of the devil and Lord just
[1:16:45] help us in this day in this hour - Lord
[1:16:49] maybe not be found without the armor of
[1:16:50] God but maybe we have that each piece of
[1:16:53] armor in place as we walk from day to
[1:16:56] day may be growing strength with you or
[1:16:58] God not compromising with pressure comes
[1:17:00] our way with conflict comes our way for
[1:17:02] Lord we know that in your scripture that
[1:17:05] trouser are worth more than then gold
[1:17:08] itself O God for it's in the triangle
[1:17:10] fire that
[1:17:12] molds us and shapes us and the more that
[1:17:14] we have adversity the stronger we get
[1:17:18] and the more grounded we get into your
[1:17:21] word Lord we appreciate those things we
[1:17:24] appreciate the tests and the trials that
[1:17:26] come our way and may we take it
[1:17:27] patiently and may we endure it patiently
[1:17:30] then we endured with prayers
[1:17:32] Thanksgiving and reading it in your
[1:17:34] Scripture to continue get stronger and
[1:17:36] stronger Oh God
[1:17:37] father those those that would be
[1:17:39] unbelievers those that had fallen away
[1:17:41] and then a Lord you know who is on my
[1:17:43] heart and lord I don't want to call our
[1:17:45] names tonight and Lord you you know
[1:17:47] who's on my heart and I can't stop
[1:17:50] thinking them when lord I just pray that
[1:17:52] that grace was just reached down it and
[1:17:54] strike him and his hardened and strike
[1:17:56] something in his mind and break him free
[1:17:58] of that bondage that was drawn withdrawn
[1:18:00] from fellowship or God I just pray that
[1:18:02] it would be with his family Lord I love
[1:18:04] him I appreciated and Lord I want to see
[1:18:06] it back and fellowship and Lord many
[1:18:09] others that have fallen away learned
