========================================

right before service I selected that as my text for this morning so I thought that was a definite indication that we're on the right mind of Christ by God's grace John chapter 4 verse 10. I'd like to preach on I will never thirst again praise God John chapter 4 verse 10. Hallelujah I will never thirst again praise God Hallelujah John 4 10 we'll read 10 down to 14. it looks like Lord willing to do communion this morning would that be okay Don't Preach too late I guess I'm just concerned the kids get too hungry if I preach too long so they get a little famished you know I don't want that to happen try to see by God's grace I remind Eve Malachi when he gets back to do me a little Aaron here but anyways let's read our text and we'll have you be seated and have a word of prayer and trust God to speak to our hearts what a joy to Worship the Lord today amen all the songs and all the specials wonderful songs John's 4 verse 10. I'll start at verse 10 and I'll read 10 11 12 13 and then we'll all read 14 together verse 10 says Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given the Living Water the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater what a question art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall never thirst again let's read verse 14. ready one two three but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life praise God let's have a word of prayer do you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God today Heavenly Father we've worshiped you Lord in the songs and we've loved it Lord we've enjoyed Lord God having brother Irvin and all the Amish Saints here Lord bless each and every one he made a great sacrifice to travel up here we thank you God for their fellowship and their their testimonies Lord God it is such an encouragement to us the Lord God to see them worshiping you in their first love it's such a joy Lord God and I thank you God for such wonderful testimonies through all the saints Lord God that you're doing and father we're grateful Lord for all the Akron Saints here as well so father we just pray in the name of Jesus Christ Lord the word we've read may it be powerful and effective each one of us Lord God May administer to each and every one of us Lord God preparing our hearts for communion here this morning Lord God so let your Holy Spirit have preeminence the Lord God just take control of me God may I get out of your way and Lord may you accomplish God all you want to accomplish father let your will be done above ours we pray always your will to be done we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name and Saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I'd like to preach on I will never thirst again yeah oh yes yes open the windows I was going to tell somebody to get the fan if you want the fan by God's grace do you think we need a fan darling he's always ask my wife sorry to put you on the spot there you think anyone think we need a fan does anyone anyone want a fan by God's grace I'd be okay okay no preference all right okay hopefully this doesn't help well have somebody get the fan here by God's grace so thank you so by God's grace will preach here on this little thought it's kind of like an Evangelical thought it's not like a teaching or anything like that I just kind of like to preach the scriptures let me set a timer here so I can make sure we have enough time don't go over too late for a communion and uh communion of course is talking with the Lord and that's what we came to do today praise God talk with the Lord we sure enjoy talking with one another but the main thing is to talk with the Lord Jesus today praise God speak to the Holy Spirit and we know the holy spirit will speak back Hallelujah so we open up with our text here that's a very familiar text to us of course Jesus ministering to the uh the woman at the well and I love what brother Ram says about this brother Graham says this woman had a had more of God in her than the priests had this woman had no theological training she didn't go to a seminary but she knew more about God than the priest did that rejected Jesus the Pharisees Sadducees and herodians and all the all the different groups there and this woman had we'd say a predestinated seed inside of her heart and life and and brother Branham of course used this verse often to show this is how Jesus interacted with people and uh this is he said this is how Jesus would contact their spirits another word for that would be discern their spirits and so we see here this example of course this woman is a Samaritan now Samaritans were some of the leftover Jews that were not taken out there were descendants of the leftover Jews who were not taken out when uh when Jerusalem was uh the people were exiled and all the different nations and then those leftover Jews they intermarried with gentiles and so that's why they're called Samaritans because they're not they weren't full Jews they were we'd say half Jew and of course then the when the Jews came back they came back with their man-made Creeds and and uh they actually learned all those they started all those man-made Creeds while they're in captivity and uh they added books unto the Old Testament and they came back with those denominational thinking and then those the dominations you know the uh uh they rejected the Samaritans right they because they weren't in their group right they weren't in their denomination uh but we see here by God's grace that this woman had a a revelation of the Messiah praise God and uh she as she was talking you know we know that Jesus started Discerning your hearts and and started telling more or new things that she never heard before she never heard that uh uh that that a man could give water that would cause a person to never thirst again hallelujah oh thank God thank God we met that man hallelujah amen aren't you glad he came to you Hallelujah I gave you a drink of his living water what a blessing praise God and so she asked you know are you greater than Jacob our father and of course he could have said a lot of things he could have said before Jacob was I am right just like he said before Abraham was I am Hallelujah in other words the spirit that was in Jesus was God hallelujah it was the creator Hallelujah it was it was the invisible God and the visible God created a body to dwell in and that body's called his son Jesus Christ Hallelujah but God was speaking the father was speaking through the son amen and God here speaks through Jesus and and discerns the thoughts and intents of her heart and I just want to bring out you know this uh just a simple thought of of Jesus says if you would know who I am you'd ask me for Living Water and he then he would give it to him now I want to just you know just make this plain and simple Church all God desires is that we ask for Living Water in other words we've got to stop thirsting for the things of the world we've got to stop caring for the things of the world and really trying to live out the things of the world we've got to repent of thirsting for the world and we've got to have a genuine thirst for Jesus Christ amen for God almighty praise God and then if one does that then Jesus says I will give you that water and then he says then you will never thirst ever again hallelujah praise God Amen thank God so you want to just preach a little bit on this and uh and hopefully a few helpful thoughts from the word of God here by God's grace now uh this might be helpful you know for Amish friends here you know in this case in this story Jesus is Discerning the thoughts of a Samaritan now in John chapter 1 he discerned the thoughts of Jews okay so let's go to John chapter one it was Nathanael John chapter one verse 44. and this this is an important part about brother Adam's Ministry brother Irvin so that's why I just thought I'd bring this out wasn't in my notes but I thought I'd just bring it out so you can see it uh now Philip was was of baseda the city of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth Nathanael and say that and we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and Nathaniel said in him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip say to him come and see him brother man says that's what you'd always tell people just come to church amen if there's questions about what you believe and how do you know I know that's true just come and see praise God just like the Queen of Sheba just come praise God no matter how far the distance is if you're hungry for God God will satisfy your thirst amen Hallelujah just come and see in other words church that ought to be encouragement if we don't feel like we can explain the message we don't feel like we can explain the Mysteries or explain all these things you don't have to explain nothing you just have to say come and see praise God Amen Hallelujah you might be gifted to explain some things and praise God for that amen so in other words just say whatever the spirit of God wants you to say but at the very least we ought to be able to say come just come and hear the word of God hallelujah amen hallelujah because it's the word of God that has life Hallelujah hey man I feel right at home this morning praise God if you like it last Sunday too I was right at home in the garage because it's the same Spirit like brother Irvin said the same Spirit praise God the Holy Spirit praise God amen now if we go down here to verse 47. now Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and say them behold in Israel I indeed in whom there's no guile or no pretend Nathaniel wasn't a pretender that's why he was a straight shooter right he's like he's like can anything good come out of Nazareth he wasn't gonna say well maybe I'll go listen he was a straight shooter can anything good come out of there there had been nothing good come out of there and he was just telling it like it was and so the first thing Jesus does he starts Discerning the thoughts and intents of his heart and Jesus tells him something about himself that only Jesus could know Jesus knew he was not a pretender and Jesus calls out he discerns his spirit and said you are a man that's completely transparent amen hallelujah now I don't know about you but I seek to be more like that praise God in other words I don't like conflict all the time I don't like to being upset I don't like to talk about hard things so I need God's help to be a better uh a better Communicator praise God and I'm not perfect and no one is and anyone that claims that is wrong only Jesus is perfect praise God but I just want you to see what kind of man Nathanael was a man with no guile Hallelujah verse 48 Nathanael say to him whence knoweth thou me when did you know me and before that Philip called thee when thou was yeah I'm sorry Jesus answers to them before the filth called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee so brother man says look Jesus had a vision of Nathanael and he must have been praying under the tree or really asking God God is there really a messiah is this really the time for the Messiah remember history says numerous people rose up claiming to be Messiahs and they draw people out in the wilderness and they'd get murdered kind of like the Jim Jones thing and all kinds of antichrist Spirits would rise up because Satan has an idea when God's Gonna you can kind of see things changing and kind of knowing God's word is going to be fulfilled but here Jesus tells him I had a vision of you Philip I was listening to brother Brown last night in a communion uh 1957 on the drive home and he's like how many have a how many he said how many are sick in here he said not too many how many have a prayer card he said okay he said but he said God is here uh and he said we don't even need prayer cards he said I see that light now he said I see a circle in the building and he shares I counted he went through seven people called out their name their address what they're going through and with each one his faith has got stronger and stronger and stronger now who do you know that can do that nobody like I can't even remember five things I can't remember one thing about five of you you know so people say well brother man memorize that and they were uh they were just they were faking it that's nonsense he preached a whole hour and a half sermon and then memorized seven things about seven details about people and and all these things impossible it was the Holy Spirit praise God because how do we know because he preached the word of God hallelujah amen thank God and there he discerns and he goes down through and tells him and each each one is the faith is rising until he says finally he said I'm out of strength he said just lay hands on one another and just believe he said speak to the Rock and they'll Walk The Rock will bring forth its water praise God that's what I want to end with today amen so I'm kind of jumping ahead of myself but you know how it is it's hard to hard to hold it back when you're preaching right brother Evan it's hard to hold it back that's where I'm going to get to by God's grace but here he sees a vision he said I saw you when you were under a tree well there would have been something Nathaniel remembered about being under that tree that was important like I said probably praying verse 49. Nathaniel answers her name Rabbi Thou Art the son of God Thou Art the king of Israel amen hallelujah amen so here we can see Nathanael had also a spiritual Gene inside of him anybody that can tell me the secrets and thoughts and Tents in my heart that can only be God hallelujah uh Nathaniel had heard about him oh this Messiah out of Nazareth and all but when he gets discerned and he and Jesus tells him only only something he knows how do you know me Lord how do you know me I saw you in a vision praise God that was the identity right there he's got to be the Messiah he said I will follow you you're the son of the Living God Amen and church when we come to church and God speaks Secrets or God gives brother Irvin John chapter four like I'm going to preach on that lets us know Jesus Christ is here amen Hallelujah amen I didn't even really know what I was going to preach today until the late this morning praise God I didn't even know and God takes me to John chapter 4 brother because he's a discerner of the thoughts thoughts your heart and with his heart amen amen verse 49 Rabbi Thou Art the son of the god Thou Art the king of Israel Jesus answers unto them because I said unto thee I think I told this to brother Irvin last week or if not one of the other brothers maybe Daniel because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believe us thou Thou shalt see greater things than these now here we get a principle if you'll believe Jesus in his first Revelations your promise to get more praise God oh like that amen how many what more of Jesus Amen when you come to Jesus he discerns your life he tells you all about uh the the questions in your life he tells you the truth and then he says if you believe that you're going to get a whole lot more praise God Amen in church isn't that how the life of a Christian it goes from Faith to Faith from glory to glory from one Revelation to another praise God amen Hallelujah verse 51 he said in him verily bear I said to you Hereafter ye shall see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man now that was fulfilled later in the ministry by God's grace so I believe if I'm not mistaken Nathaniel saw Jesus in a vision and Angels going up and down if I'm not mistaken praise God now I go to John 7 38 I believe I preach this at Amish Country a few weeks ago it might have been the first time I went but here we just see again another a witness that the Living Water is the holy spirit John 7 38. well actually let me just read 37. in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink so the question is are we thirsty because Jesus invites everybody everybody can have a drink Jesus has enough water to feed this entire church amen Hallelujah and your friends and your family praise God he's got enough water praise God the question is are you thirsty for Jesus and all of us would say a hearty what we'd say a hearty amen hallelujah we say Jesus I'm thirsty I need Living Waters praise God I want your spirit to flow through me Hallelujah speak through me Hallelujah satisfy The Thirst in my life Hallelujah amen verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water it might be in a song right I could sing you your love forever praise God Hallelujah any song I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them praise God it might be flown out through a song it might be flown out through a testimony it might be flown out through preaching it might be flown out through something but God's spirit if it's in you it's going to come out praise God the words are going to come out the Praises are going to come out praise God the worship is going to come out why because you've got life inside of you you've got a whale inside of your soul praise God oh thank God for the will Hallelujah thank you Jesus verse 30. eight you need to leaveth on me as a scripture I've said out of his belly shall follow rivers of Living Water so it's not a trickle now church we all get trickles at times right but we all go through hard times where the Praises really aren't ringing out like they used to remember he promised Waters rivers of waters and that's what the Bible says he restores our soul praise God hallelujah that's why David said my cup runs over amen cast me not away from thy presence of God take not your Living Waters for me amen restore the joy of my salvation restore the rivers of water Let the Praises flow out let the word of God flow out let me be a light Let Me Be A Witness let me testify to somebody about the life-giving Waters of Jesus Hallelujah amen Glory verse 39 but this fake heat of that of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified as we went over this is the Holy Ghost and the soul of the believer praise God in the Old Testament the Saints could get the Holy Spirit on their body they could dance like David danced praise God hallelujah they could dance and Samson could lift up Gates and carry him on his back for miles and miles and miles and they had the anointing on the Mind where they could write the word of God they could prophesy they could do amazing things but the Holy Ghost had never come on the soul and so the sins the Bible said were fully abolished their sins weren't really done away with uh and so God couldn't fill their souls with the Holy Ghost but when Jesus came Jesus Paid the price Hallelujah in this case uh the the life of Jesus could come upon the worshiper in the Old Testament you want you wouldn't want the life of a of a goat to come on you you wouldn't want the life of a bullock to come on you you you you wouldn't want that but that was the sacrifices but the Bible said we have better sacrifice now amen we got one sacrifice once and for all and now the spirit of Jesus the spirit of the sacrifice can now come upon the believer praise God amen now he takes away all our sins and now the Holy Spirit falls on the soul of the believer oh thank you Lord now brother Adam says this in the Ephesian Church age I just got a couple of quotes I don't have a whole lot of quotes here he says uh now that tree back there and eat and that tree which was a source of life was Jesus in John chapter six through eight Jesus sets him forth sets forth himself as a source of eternal life he called himself The Bread of Heaven he spoke of giving himself and that if a man ate of him he would never die praise God he said he proclaimed that he knew Abraham and that before Abraham he was he prophesied that he himself would give Living Waters that if any man I'm sorry if any man drink he would never thirst again praise God but he would live eternally so what is this bread and this water it's eternal life oh I just caught it now Jesus said you won't hunger anymore for bread because I'll be your bread Hallelujah ah the bread and the wine amen he said I won't drink anymore he said you won't thirst anymore because I'll give you the the blood of my spirit praise God oh my thank God what a blessing praise God and what is it it's eternal life he said Jesus showed himself as The Great I Am he's the bread of life The Well of Life The Eternal one the tree of life he was back there in Eden in the midst of the garden even as he will be in the midst of the paradise of God oh my God Amen thank God for his Mercy now go to Ephesians 2 verse 3. this is a little lesson that was meant a lot to me a couple years ago Ephesians 2 verse 3. I preach a few sermons on thirst Ephesians 2 verse 3. I just think this would be helpful for all of us just a good refresher I know I need it so I feel like if I need it then I feel like the people might need it too praise God Ephesians 2 verse 3. now Paul's writing course this is a beautiful chapter on salvation and the gift of salvation but he says in verse 3 among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others now let's stop right there now the Bible says you have desires of your flesh and you've got desires of your mind like brother Daniel you're going to build something weren't you last week we were talking about you were going to build something for your business right so he was he was telling me a little bit about last week they're asking about getting the materials so brother Daniel had a desire in his mind to do something so the mind has desires I need to think about this I need to plan this out I need to buy that it's a good example buddy but the flesh has desires too well I need to eat or I need to drink or I need to do this or I need to exercise or I need to do that so we have desires both in our mind in other words your mind desires something every day and your body desires something every day but then also your soul desires something every day so brother Irvin we have three parts we have to feed and take care of all day every day praise God we got to take care of our bodies their desire things our mind and desire stimulation right of the things of God and our soul desires it as well Hallelujah and Jesus said If any man will thirst If any man will hunger I'll give him bread and I'll give him more honor praise God so all three parts of you all day are crying for something feed me or maybe give me sleep I'm going on four hours of sleep here so I feel like I'm doing pretty good about God's grace but my body's saying put me to bed I just couldn't sleep real good last night maybe all the excitement or something but your body's calling for something your mind is calling for something and your Soul's Calling for something and Jesus said if you can recognize that all those all three are calling for the word of God then you'll never hunger you'll never thirst you'll be satisfied God wants to satisfy all three parts of our being praise God amen so if you got your Bible let's go to the Book of Psalms here I've been on Psalms a lot lately and just bear with me just a second I want to look some up here here we go okay go to Psalm 17 here we're just going to flip through just a few verses I mean there's there's 16 verses in the Book of Psalms where David is talking about God is our satisfaction in other words you know we must satisfy our desires with Christ and Christ Alone now we got family members like we're praying uh for Sarah's brother by God's grace as she put a prayer request in we pray for him on Wednesday night and uh and there's family members that we know and love and they thirst for relationships or they thirst for money or popularity or or status or something we all we all thirst for for all these things but a Christian has to make God their number one and only thirst praise God Amen yes we got to have businesses I got to work we all got to work and make money and Feed the Children and and all the important things we have to do but the main thirst that's satisfied is our thirst after God Hallelujah now I said Psalm 17 15. as for me I will Behold thy face in righteousness I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness how many want to wake up happy in the presence of God that's what the Bible if the Bible promised this you in the Old Testament what about the new amen I'll be satisfied with this presence go to Psalm 22 26. so I'm 22 26 the Bible says the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the Lord that seek Him your heart shall live forever amen a church what a promise if you spend any time seeking God God promise you'll find him Hallelujah what a promise God will satisfy you spend a little time with God spend a little time seeking God don't worry God's going to come and bless you God's going to come and meet you there praise God remember we preached it a few weeks ago all the animals are calling to God for food all the animals on land all the water animals they're all calling God God I need food God I knew food and God can take all those requests and say yes I meet that yes yes yes yes I'll take her he can meet all those requests and if he can meet the Beast request what about the children in his own image praise God what about his sons and daughters amen hallelujah Hallelujah if we have a thirst for God he's here to satisfy it amen thank God I like Psalm 36 8 if you would Psalms 30 8 6 because this deals with coming to church and that's my favorite thing in life is to go to church praise God wherever the people of God are that's where the church is it's not a building it's a group of people praise God Psalm 36 8 they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house oh thank God and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures is that is that what the will of God is to you is the will of God pleasure to you even if it's hard we still got to recognize it's God's will it ought to be our pleasure to surrender to God it ought to be our desire to surrender to God and say God your ways are higher than my ways your thoughts are higher than my thoughts I'll trust in you your word will not return void you'll keep your promise to me praise God if you stand with God God will stand with you amen the fatness of thy house all the blessings of the house of God how many know there's blessings in the house of God that's where I find so many praise God thank you Jesus Hallelujah go to uh yeah here we go Psalm 63 5. that's the one I was looking for like I said there's 16 we're not going to read all of them but Psalm 63 verse 5. Lydia why don't you read that one since you're there honey you're really fast here go ahead amen so now we know what it what it feels like when your Soul's getting fed the word of God right the Bible says it's like getting the marrow and the fatness the best tasting parts right the healthiest parts my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips amen hallelujah praise God we just preached on Joy recently too God Amen so see God wants to satisfy you and when you're satisfied with God you praise God you love God you worship God you've got joy in God Amen ah Hallelujah in other words if you drink you'll be joyful praise God if you Feast on God's word you'll have joy in your heart Hallelujah oh thank God and notice your soul your soul the soul needs the word of God the soul needs the Praises of God like I was telling somebody recently uh they were saying you know how do I get the joy back I said well just start I said for me it works for me uh the way I get my Joe back is I just start thinking about all the simple blessings that we have like my children are healthy my children got food every time I struggle God provides whatever I need every time oh I gotta wait longer than others sometimes but he still provides and just in the simple things like that like I told the one person I said you know that's why I like Thanksgiving Services because I I try to encourage everybody come up here and tell us all what you're thankful for I want to hear from everybody you know I want to hear some testimonies I haven't heard for a while you know or whatever I love one I just love that the giving of thanks and I told the saint I said I said when that happens when I start testifying about what God has done it's like that River of water starts building up on the inside of me praise God like that song says come up my soul don't get quiet on God because you've got a line inside of you in other words you've got a praise inside of you you've got Joy inside of you praise God remember us remember what God has done and the praise of God will start ringing in your soul praise God amen thank God see your soul will be satisfied um so I'm 65 4. all right so I'm 65 4. blessed is the man whom thou chooses church God chose you and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy Holy Temple oh God we just want to bless God God calls you blessed because we came out of man-made churches and we come to the real Church the body of Jesus Christ amen and now we're living in the prince of God praise God not controlled by man but controlled by Christ Jesus Hallelujah and the bible promises you'll be satisfied in the house of God hallelujah in the courts of God how many can say Amen to that praise God oh I can say amen hallelujah we're satisfied with God's goodness in his holy Temple praise God amen boy there's so many I could hardly get to these now here's one for when we wake up go to Psalm 90 verse 14. I think Shane and Shane did a song on this satisfies With Your Love yeah we listen to that one yesterday that's a beautiful song Psalm 90 verse 14. we'll just do a couple more here Psalm 90 verse 14. you got that sister Emma there we go let me read that for us hey amen praise God now Church you're going to interpret this a couple ways satisfy me early in the morning or save me when I'm young so I spend all my days giving God the praise amen hallelujah early satisfy me early I'm so glad God saved me at 19. praise God before I turned into even worse to Hooligan and sinner like I would have been no doubt I'm so glad God saved me early I wish it would have been earlier but I'm thankful it was early enough praise God Hallelujah I'll just say like this anytime God Saves you is a good time praise God anytime God save you that's early enough praise God because as you're saying before you'd go to hell God in his Mercy saves us and takes us to Heaven amen he opens up paradise and say today you'll be with me in Paradise Hallelujah all right on time satisfy me early with your love Hallelujah amen show me your mercy early now so most of the time goes on we're gonna enjoy Psalm 91 16. so I'm 91 16 but amen you want to read that Psalm 91 16. amen hallelujah you know we want to we want to live the full life God has for us praise God now we know like Jesus he died at 33. and uh Stephen I think was 29 when he was stoned but no doubt they were satisfied both of course the Son of God was satisfied but here the psalm writer says Lord give me a long life that I can praise you all my days satisfy me with a long life so I can see my children's children grow up and be Servants of the most high God Amen praise God glory all right now yeah go to Psalms 107 9. I think I'll actually I'll stop right there for the psalm scriptures not for preaching I got a little bit more to go here by God's grace Psalms 107 verse 9. you got that Malachi you read that buddy amen now Church you have a Divine promise if your soul is longing for God he gave you the promise I will satisfy your longing Hallelujah it's a Divine promise now what we need church is we need to be longing after God and not longing for whatever we desire from the world whatever our mind desires our flesh desires if you're a Christian your soul will always desire God hallelujah so we've got a long in our and we gotta we got to bring our our bodies and our minds into subjection to the Holy Spirit and we've got to long for the things of God and if we do if any man thirst praise God the Bible says I will give him Waters of Life freely praise God and God promised I'll satisfy the longing soul the soul that wants to know God God will show himself to them praise God what a promise amen now go to Jeremiah 2. I was just listening to brother Brandon on the way here to church and this scripture come up Jeremiah 2 12. I'll read this one I'll give everybody a break on this one here Jeremiah 2 12. be astonished oh you Heavens at this and be horribly afraid be very desolate saith Lord now remember chapter one was a beautiful chapter God told Jeremiah before I formed you in the womb I knew you and ordained you a prophet see church God has ordained a Ministry for all of us before you reform before you even came to this earth church if you're wondering what you're supposed to do just know God's going to let you know long for it long for it seek after God long for the things of God because God knew in advance what Jeremiah was going to be and God knows what you're going to be too praise God the thing to do is long for God and God will satisfy you praise God like I was talking with Brother John yesterday and we're talking about being fulfilled in life and he said are you fulfilled brother I said absolutely I mean I still desire more of God but I Feel So Satisfied with what God's done he's taking care of my family he's giving me a loving Church by God's grace and really that's the best thing you can say about a church is that they're loving right because Jesus said that you're known they're known that they're my disciples by their love one for another right I got a good job I can take care of the kids and get enough rest I don't have to work too much I shouldn't say too much but I got a good job praise God a lot of breaks you know to stay refreshed I said I feel fulfilled I feel satisfied you know God has Vindicated that uh that I'm I'm walking in the will of God I believe that by God's grace what a blessing to know that praise God that's what the Bible calls the mystery of God's Will and each person should should seek the mystery of God's will and church if you long for God's revelation he'll give you the Revelation like we're talking on the phone yesterday brother Ervin God wants to give Revelation so much and brother man says pray for Revelation more than anything else praise God pray for the will of God is it God's will to heal this person is it God's will to save that person is it God's will to do this in my life is it God's will to do that is it God's will for all your decisions that's fighting the mystery of God longing after God and God will satisfy you praise God amen sorry if I'm wearing you out here verse 13 here let me try to move on here Jeremiah 2 13. for My People Israel have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and have hewed them out cisterns broken sisters that can hold no water now one of the commentators said you know the world the Sinners the Gentiles they just done one evil they just got idols but Israel did two evils the the Sinners never knew God God didn't make himself known to them right he didn't call them and call them out of Egypt he called Israel out of Egypt so the the two evils are greater than the one evil and the first evil is that they forsook The Living Water and they hewed out cisterns now some writers say they would they would use mud and they'd uh they'd create like a pool and try to catch water in the cisterns others say that of course they might build a cistern with with wood or some other material brass or something but we see here the idea here is instead of taking the Living Water of God they wanted a stagnated water they thought well I'll just catch the water I'll try to catch and contain all this water I'll just try to contain the holy spirit in my denomination you can't do that praise God Amen it's impossible like brother Adam said God will move and but and the sad thing is people will build up a denomination they never should have done that when you build up the denomination you're building up the cistern and God said don't build a sister because I promise I always pour out fresh waters amen you don't need a sister because I'm going to pour it out from Heaven Hallelujah and there's no end to this rain there's farmer rain there's latter rain Saints God wants to rain Hallelujah oh thank God Amen and he says God rebukes him and said you built a cistern but it's even even that don't hold water your denomination can't hold the spirit of God in it's going to leak out and fail eventually so church we can learn a good lesson there's two evils first you forsake God's water and then people build a denomination well this is all God can do nothing more and brother man tells us always put a comma after everything you believe because God can give you a little more Revelation on the same revelation that's right Hallelujah so I thought you'd like that now the sermon brother random says you know I used to have this old sister and I had to pour water down there and Prime and Prime and Prime with this old sucker pump to get it up out of there you know pour some more water and it just poured a bunch of bugs and things in it to pump out bugs and things that's just about the way some of these systematic revivals is right they're trying to pump up the people to get a Revival but all the water that comes out is stagnated Waters right in other words man-made creeds God's three persons or everybody has to speak in tongues or it doesn't matter if you get tattoos or not or you can marry two or three times that stagnated Waters that's not a Revival no matter how much emotion no matter how much dancing or how much the music those are stagnated Waters God doesn't give those Waters at my grandma's when I was growing up I don't have any siblings in here I thought I thought maybe Betsy would be here or something like that my my grandma Smith had a pump and we had a pump and I had to pump and pump on that thing and finally some of the water from the pond would come out of there but there's always dirty water I wouldn't drink that I knew as a child don't drink that water you're going to get sick and yet the spiritual thing is don't go to denomination and drink their water you're going to get sick hallelujah thank God God doesn't tell us to go to denomination God doesn't tell us to go to the man-made Pub we've already got a living well praise God God doesn't tell us to go to the well God puts the well inside of ourselves amen hallelujah praise God thank God Amen so when you read your Bible in the morning you get some of that well water coming up and you read John chapter four praise God then the preacher preaches on it praise God hallelujah it's God feeding us with the Waters of his word hallelujah oh brother said but thank God there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel veins where Sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains Hallelujah he said just one taste of that water it's convincing to all kinds of courage to clergyman he says he said why should we want any swamp water or stagnated water he says how would you like to swap an Artesian well for swamp water full of bugs and contaminations of all kinds of man-made theories which God that said add one word to his word or take one of his words away his part will be taken out of the Book of Life my goodness Hallelujah let me read this he said what he said that's the matter with so many people's experiences today they're just full of Wiggle Tails wiggling from one to another in other words stagnated water and one to another telling tales that ain't got no true to it at all that's right wiggle out of one into another I was Methodist I joined the Baptist I was Catholic I went to this I went to that it's just wiggle Tales he said forget the whole thing in other words come out of her my people and come to the Fountain amen the Artesian well that ever living presence of Christ I believe them to be the inexhaustible Fountain of Life the more you get from him the fresher it gets the more you get from him the colder it gets the better it gets the sweeter it tastes amen come on somebody amen ain't that the truth praise God if we really thirst and long after God the services get better ah come on somebody amen the worship gets better the song specials get better praise God is that right the song service gets better the more you long after God the better it gets Hallelujah [Music] if it got old then God would be guilty appointing you to a broken cistern so when it gets old is it God's fault or is it our fault well we know the answer that amen but keep all your sins confessed keep calling on God keep longing for Jesus and he'll bring satisfaction oh Hallelujah he said I've been serving him now for 33 years and each day grows still sweeter than it was the day before Jesus said you would never thirst if we drank of this water notice how great it is how many believe it's great Hallelujah let me just try to close here I'm already gone over half hour and that's really short for me by God's grace really short well you can see here God has water and he wants us uh to approach it in a certain way he wants us to come to him and daily seek water and not try to catch it in a man-made system well if I just do this like I did yesterday how many times that happened we gotta we got a blessing and a service well how did I play it in that service I'm going to try to repeat that again today now we got to be careful we don't make God like a an Aaron boy for us or God like some machine right well if I punch this and punch that I'll get the same results [Music] right now we always got to be faithful we always got to be obeying the word of God we have to understand God moves the wind blows and nobody knows when it's coming who knew that Revival was coming over there in the point anybody know that was coming I thought it might have come on Thursday night that's the first night everybody's got their most energy or maybe Friday night the last service brother Brooks is going to preach you never know but we know God wants to pour out a spirit we know the wind's going to blow so we gather with expectation we long and say God send your win send your ring send your power send your water and God is faithful when it comes just at the right time Hallelujah it comes as we're longing for God he pours out his Spirit he satisfies the Thirsty Soul amen um thank God well let me close with this here because I'm doing a new communion by God's grace I think it'd be best you got to work tonight buddy okay yeah so it'd be good to do it tonight here and brother Bang's here so I was hoping brother Vang and brother Austin could take it so we can do it today and our honest friends are welcome to communion with us when was the last time you did commune we haven't done it since I think November or December of last year I don't do it every month I just kind of do it as I'm led to the Holy Spirit by God's grace and that's okay the Bible just said just do it till he comes back he didn't say how often to do it so I felt led to do it today by God's grace and so we're happy to have all of you by the grace of God you're welcome to partake in the Lord's supper with us amen now go to well I'm going to close with this go to uh Exodus 17 6 Exodus 17 6. of course this is familiar if you listen to brother man preach I think he's preached it five times speak to the Rock Hallelujah speak to the Rock Exodus 17 6. yeah it seems like we get the landscapers always on Sunday in the spring and summer and fall that's okay God bless that man maybe someday we can keep witness into him I witnessed him to him before I'll try to do it again by God's grace all's will I was listening to brother Brown last night and he had to deal with jalopy races so jalopies are a certain type of automobiles anybody know what a jalopy is a certain brand of automobile and you can hear the jalopies racing we'll just have to raise our voices he said we'll just have to shop Down the Walls like Jericho you know praise God Amen I like that Exodus 17 6. now of course you know this this is uh the people are thirsty right God brought them out and they danced on the red Seashore praise God but pretty soon they get thirsty and the Bible said they start chiding with Moses give us water give us water and Moses in verse 4 I'm sorry in verses verse 4 Moses cries unto God and says what shall I do on this people they be almost ready to Stone me isn't that interesting you know God used the Prophet The Prophet you God used the prophet to deliver them and then the next problem they have they want to destroy the leader right right we should we should have patience with everybody praise God let's be patient with that each and every person by God's grace but look but look how church it just shows it shows how quick we are to forget the testimonies right I mean you would think how could I ever forget walking through a red sea with water walls on the both sides of me that's true how could you but also how could we forever get what God did for a sister who and brother Bang's dad there how can we forget that great testimony or God bringing back Austin and then bringing Lena with him how can we forget that praise God see it's just human nature we're going to forget from time to time but the Bible says the Holy Spirit Will stir up our remembrance praise God and remind us of what he's done hallelujah so we don't judge Israel they didn't have the baptism Holy Ghost we were done the same thing right but verse 5 the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the Elders of Israel and the thy rod wherein thou smote is the river taken thy hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock and aurob and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel Hallelujah now here we say we see that people are longing for water amen and Moses cries out to God and God said strike the Rock and water will come out of the rock praise God now you know the next time in numbers I think his numbers 20 I'm not going to go there but the next time God told Moses speak to the Rock and Moses disobeyed because he was upset with the people he magnified himself now preachers really got to be careful not to get upset with the people and the people got to be careful not to get upset with the preacher see we've all got to have the love of God hallelujah we all need the love and mercy and patience Marcia glad patience is one of those virtues he gives you praise God aren't you glad that's one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit naturally comes out of a Christian Life Hallelujah and you can be patient with one another but brother Adam uses that text there here Exodus 17 and numbers 20 and he brings it down to close he says tonight if you need a drink if you're thirsty if you're longing for God he said all we've got to do is speak to the Rock praise God and then when the Holy Spirit starts starts falling people are shouting rejoicing you can hear the prayers go up and he says he says now he said now you don't got to speak to him he said now praise the Rock hallelujah hallelujah Now Praise The Rock in other words he's here and he's going to meet your need God Hallelujah by God is here amen God's going to meet the need so now how many believe that can happen today praise God let's end our feet musicians you can come praise God before I take communion let's have a time of prayer let's speak to the Rock for all of our thirsts all of our desires praise God and how many believe God will minister to our needs amen he may not answer right away but he promised I'll answer in some way praise God you may have to wait he might tell you no he might tell you later he might do it right now but in God's wisdom he knows the best way to answer your prayer amen the main thing church is for every man and woman and child to thirst after God's water how many need more of God's spirit today let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer now church do you pray in your own way I'm going to pray for these needs that we prayed for earlier if you're longing or you're thirsting for God to move or meet a need let's talk to the Rock today let's talk to the Rock who brings forth his Waters the Bible said in First Corinthians 10 that rock was who that rock was crying Christ became a dry Rock Christ became this this massive rock in a dry land and he smote him once and then all they do is speak to him and the waters would have come forth abundantly Church that's all we got to do is speak to the Rock Jesus Christ today let's pray together father God we're so grateful the rock is here amen we feel the rock we feel the presence of Jesus today you've indicated by the John 4 reference [Music] Lord I want to thank you God that our souls will never thirst again [Music] and Lord in that context I didn't actually get to that now that in that context it means the soul will never go after the world [Music] sinful lifestyle we used to have happened [Music] because I've always had a water right here I've always had a rock that I could talk to [Music] you Rock should I preach the word of God dear Rock Lord Jesus should we start a church [Music] the Lord through all these years we speak to The Rock The Rock The Rock Lord I Thank you for today as we approach communion Lord we know communion is talking so that's what we're going to do now we're going to have communion and talk it over Saint let's start by talking over let's confess any sin in our hearts let's just take a moment to pray your own way [Music]
