[13:52] like to just share a few announcements
[13:55] the Sunday Lord willing I'd like to have
[13:57] a carry in this Sunday so I'll text
[13:59] everybody about that between services I
[14:02] still won't do a second but I'm gonna
[14:03] ask my wife to remind me to sit down and
[14:05] relax so I don't preach so hard the
[14:07] second service to wear myself out so you
[14:10] could do that honey I'd appreciate that
[14:11] so let's try to a carry in this Sunday
[14:14] I'll text everybody and let them know
[14:16] about that I just kind of wore myself
[14:18] out you know Sunday you know preaching
[14:20] twice and song leading twice I kind of
[14:22] wore myself out a little bit so let's
[14:24] just do two more services also the
[14:27] following Sunday brother Simon will be
[14:29] preaching because my wife and I
[14:30] scheduled a little getaway from my wife
[14:31] and I to get away a little bit rest up
[14:33] so brother Simon will be here on
[14:35] February 17th for two services then the
[14:37] following Sunday my brother cam will be
[14:40] here so it three Smith brothers three
[14:42] weeks three weekends in a row by God's
[14:44] grace so looking forward to that and we
[14:46] may call a communion on when brother
[14:49] cams here on the 24th I maybe do a
[14:51] communion that evening by God's grace on
[14:53] the 24 so Lord willing would like to do
[14:56] that by the grace of the Lord okay also
[14:59] just announcement here I just want to
[15:01] share but I got the first draft of my
[15:03] book in my hands by God's grace oh I'm
[15:06] so happy about that you can tell there's
[15:09] just a few mistakes I've found a few
[15:11] more mistakes so it's not the final
[15:13] drafts I got to fix I fix a few things
[15:16] but I sent it out to four other pastors
[15:18] I'm sorry
[15:19] three other pastors one and then brother
[15:20] Simon was evangelist so four other
[15:23] people got in our hands now and they're
[15:25] making corrections and so it looks
[15:27] pretty good front and back there look
[15:29] looking really excited about it and
[15:30] reading through it trying to find any
[15:32] more mistakes
[15:33] I'm really excited and thankful that the
[15:36] Lord allowed us to be able to do that so
[15:38] we're maybe a month away
[15:39] Lord willing maybe a couple of weeks
[15:42] we'll see what happens kind of depends
[15:44] on how quickly the people can get me
[15:46] some corrections but really excited
[15:49] about that and hope it'll be a blessing
[15:51] to the Bride of Christ the pastor's who
[15:54] have read it one pastor from Arkansas
[15:56] said it's much needed he's going to try
[15:58] to get copies for everybody in his
[15:59] church then another pastor said it's a
[16:01] great tool it's be a great help and
[16:03] brother cam said he said that these
[16:05] thing think is gonna be very helpful for
[16:06] especially young sisters who maybe don't
[16:09] know the scriptures about modesty and
[16:10] holiness and things like that so that's
[16:13] what I hope it is I hope it's a book
[16:16] that brings people revelation I hope
[16:18] it's a book as they meditate on the Word
[16:19] of God that God overview stuff and I
[16:22] hope that introduces denominational
[16:25] people to the message of the hour that's
[16:27] what I really want that's I really
[16:28] wanted to be so I'm really excited about
[16:30] that brother I don't mention brother
[16:32] Branham but like I said to chapter 8 so
[16:34] that's when they can know where do I get
[16:36] all these teachings from from Jesus
[16:38] first but then Jesus gave me brother
[16:39] Branham brother Graham gave them to us
[16:41] so anyway looking for that also
[16:46] just a few prayer requests here I guess
[16:50] just one actually to keep praying for
[16:53] the boy in my class he's had it really
[16:56] hard but just this week something
[16:58] changed the mom put a post today on
[17:00] faith yesterday on Facebook and said all
[17:01] of a sudden and just changed so he
[17:03] hasn't thrown up or had any any other
[17:08] problems for the last 48 hours we can
[17:11] thank the Lord for that thank the Lord
[17:12] for that and we're just thankful for
[17:17] that but also brother Jim from Albion
[17:19] sends his greetings he's a pastor he's
[17:21] preached I think last year right maybe
[17:23] two years ago he preached for us or was
[17:24] it last year probably two years ago was
[17:26] it last year okay so we had him out
[17:28] praise God that's right yeah
[17:29] right the end of July yeah where he he
[17:32] came and preached that last outreach
[17:34] service for us and I just told to preach
[17:35] yeah so he sends his greetings but he
[17:38] also asked for prayer so I told me well
[17:40] yeah we will lift up in prayer I said
[17:42] many a Wednesday night I'll pray for cam
[17:43] and brother Brooks and all the brothers
[17:46] around here brother Jim and so we'll
[17:48] lift him up in prayer tonight
[17:50] are there any other requests tonight

[18:26] letter in the mail from a preacher from
[18:28] California and he says I never heard
[18:30] about what you teach but he said I found
[18:32] you on the Internet
[18:33] I like some more resources from you so
[18:34] let's pray for that man and perhaps the
[18:36] Lord will reveal the message to him so
[18:39] he's a California pastor just got that

[28:54] the grace of Lord thank the Lord for his
[28:56] amazing love Alleluia like to go to
[29:01] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 tonight I
[29:03] like to look at part 6 of the purpose
[29:06] series by the grace of North Hebrews 12
[29:14] verse 1 very familiar scripture to us
[29:36] but would like to look at it in the
[29:38] light of God's view of our lives God
[29:41] looks at our life in one way there's a
[29:43] few ways he encourages us to look at our
[29:45] lives and one of them is a race I'm a
[29:47] little bit familiar with that you know I
[29:49] used to run track you know so play a lot
[29:51] of sports a lot of racing in my life but
[29:54] God gives us these different metaphors
[29:56] and we look at Lord willing look at for
[29:58] metaphors tonight of how God paints out
[30:01] our life for us ways we can think about
[30:04] it and that should help us to know our
[30:06] purpose by the grace of the Lord Hebrews
[30:10] 12:1 if you're there say Amen let's read
[30:13] verse 1 together then I'll read a little
[30:15] bit further let's just join our voices
[30:18] for verse one on three one two three
[30:23] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[30:25] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[30:29] let us lay aside every weight and the
[30:32] sin which does so easily beset us and
[30:35] let us run with patience the race that
[30:39] is set before us I like to read verse
[30:42] two also looking unto Jesus the author
[30:45] and finisher of our faith who for the
[30:49] joy that was set before him endured the
[30:51] cross
[30:52] despising the shame and has sat down at
[30:55] the right hand of the throne of God for
[30:58] consider him that endured such
[31:00] contradiction of sinners against him
[31:02] lest she be wearied and faint in your
[31:05] minds you have not yet resisted unto
[31:09] blood striving against sin and you have
[31:13] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[31:15] unto you as unto children my son despise
[31:18] not thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[31:20] faint when thou art rebuked of him amen
[31:24] let's have a word of Prayer if you ever
[31:25] need on your heart just make it known
[31:26] unto God hear Heavenly Father we loved
[31:29] your word we've sung your songs we
[31:31] worship you tonight your love is what's
[31:33] defending us Lord on all of our battles
[31:36] it's your love that gave us the shield
[31:37] of faith to extinguish every dart of
[31:40] Satan oh god it's your love that gave us
[31:42] a sort of the spirit to chop down our
[31:45] enemies that come against us Lord with
[31:47] your word it's your love that gave us
[31:50] the helmet of salvation to protect our
[31:52] mind Lord God the belt of truth Lord to
[31:55] hold up all of our armor Lord and to
[31:57] keep us in a ready position our minds
[32:00] ready to fight against all lies we thank
[32:04] you for your love did this to us and
[32:06] Lord we give you glory father help us
[32:08] Lord to lay aside any sin that would
[32:10] easily beset us and let us run with
[32:13] patience the race that set before us
[32:15] speak to us we pray tonight in Jesus
[32:18] Christ's name and the church said Amen
[32:21] god bless you being seated praise the
[32:22] Lord
[32:25] I'll have a few slides here tonight
[32:28] Lydia not all I don't didn't have the
[32:30] time to get maybe all the slides but
[32:33] we'd like to use some quotes here and
[32:37] scriptures by the grace of God so look
[32:45] at that part
[32:45] six tonight I told you on Sunday I think
[32:49] I'm gonna close the service kind of with
[32:51] it'll update on some things that's been
[32:55] said you know in the Jefferson movement
[32:57] I think I'm gonna or Jefferson bill or
[32:58] rather Jefferson Jeffersonville movement
[33:01] I just kind of said that on Sunday I've
[33:02] just kind of been listening to some
[33:05] things that are coming out of that
[33:06] movement I just kind of want to share
[33:08] them in order to just show you the truth
[33:12] I just want you to see the truth not
[33:15] that any of us are you know moved by
[33:16] that I don't think any of us have ever
[33:17] been you know tempted to forsake you
[33:21] know preaching live preaching you know I
[33:23] hope not because brother Branham never
[33:26] did that and he never told anybody to do
[33:28] that but just because it's such a burden
[33:32] it's the it's the current it's the
[33:36] current wave the Bible said there's
[33:39] tossed you know by every wave of
[33:42] doctrine and so this is the most recent
[33:44] wave that's kind of hit the message
[33:46] remember back in 2012 it was to believe
[33:48] the signs stuff that was the wave that
[33:50] hit the gospel ship right but our ships
[33:53] still sailing thank God
[33:55] we've capped the wave thank the Lord and
[33:59] overcame the wave well this is this this
[34:01] Jeffersonville tape only movement that's
[34:03] you know that's the it's the current
[34:05] wave and I don't say that critically but
[34:09] we got to be honest what's the truth of
[34:11] God's Word and so like I told you on
[34:13] Sunday night I said I want to mention
[34:15] that so I'm gonna mention that I've been
[34:16] studying a little bit on that too but
[34:19] lore winning tonight we want to start
[34:21] with this thought we read our text I
[34:23] didn't get to all that I put verses 1:8
[34:25] but didn't get to all that I want to
[34:27] just start with some inspiration that
[34:28] I've received from chapters 5 and 6 in
[34:33] this book I read this book last year it
[34:37] was a real good blessing to me like I
[34:40] said I think about 90% of it is pretty
[34:42] accurate I should say pretty Akron oh
[34:45] really believed 99% is really accurate I
[34:48] would encourage you to read it as long
[34:49] as you just obviously if you don't
[34:50] believe in the Trinity I mean you'll be
[34:51] you'll be good I just got to stay away
[34:53] from that there's two thoughts on the
[34:55] Trinity and I actually actually cite
[34:57] those
[34:59] Quotes in my upcoming book after this
[35:01] one gets out Lord willing if God Terry's
[35:03] the writer says that you know God didn't
[35:07] need us because he wasn't alone he had
[35:10] the Trinity with him so he had all you
[35:13] have the two other persons with him and
[35:14] he was he wasn't at all he wasn't alone
[35:16] at all so it doesn't really need us or
[35:18] didn't have to it which is true I mean
[35:19] one way God didn't need us the Bible
[35:21] says that in acts 17 it's not that God
[35:23] needs you God doesn't need man you know
[35:26] necessarily to exist he's easy turtle
[35:28] but he wanted us he wanted our
[35:30] fellowship right and he was lonely in
[35:33] that sense like he wanted the fellowship
[35:35] with his children and then there's
[35:38] another one where he mentions the
[35:40] Trinity and of course we know that's
[35:41] wrong but like I said I found much great
[35:44] truth in here and I want to start with
[35:47] that and then Lord willing look at four
[35:50] metaphors
[35:51] where God gives us to kind of view our
[35:54] purpose from God's eyes many times you
[35:57] know it you know if we're not careful
[35:59] you know Satan will go try to convince
[36:01] us you don't really have a purpose right
[36:04] your life is hopeless there's no real
[36:06] meaning behind your life and you know if
[36:10] you're not famous if you're not rich if
[36:12] you're not a part of a big church or if
[36:14] you're not if you're your name's not all
[36:15] over social media or or you're not a
[36:18] millionaire you're nothing right that's
[36:20] what Satan tries to get people to to
[36:22] think all your life is just who are you
[36:24] you're one little person and so Satan
[36:27] tries to attack your purpose but the
[36:29] Word of God tells us our purpose we have
[36:32] a holy calling amen
[36:34] and then inside of that holy calling if
[36:36] you're male you know you have a certain
[36:38] calling this way if you're a female then
[36:40] you're calling goes off a different
[36:42] direction there's branches like roots
[36:43] you know and then they all trickle down
[36:45] and and your purpose goes down one of
[36:48] those tracks and you've got to recognize
[36:51] you got to see your track which one it
[36:53] goes down and you've got to be obedient
[36:55] and you don't you want to stay on God's
[36:57] track and not try to afford your own
[36:59] track and so it's important that we we
[37:03] have to get in tune we saw that's last
[37:05] week that God will drive you to your
[37:08] purpose right
[37:09] he drove Cain to his purpose just
[37:11] offer the right sacrifice and you'll be
[37:13] accepted he drove Judas to his purpose
[37:16] you're chosen you just got to be a
[37:18] faithful apostle just don't just don't
[37:20] lust over money and you'll be all right
[37:22] he drove the rich young ruler to his
[37:24] purpose
[37:24] just forsake everything and come follow
[37:26] me you have amazing riches put out but
[37:29] they didn't they didn't accept that
[37:31] purpose but thank God there was some
[37:33] like Peter and James I said all these
[37:36] fishing nets who cares about this job I
[37:38] want to serve Jesus I'm willing to leave
[37:42] it behind I'm willing to leave my dad
[37:44] with my job that he thinks I'm gonna
[37:46] take over one day I'm willing to leave
[37:48] the father's business in order to join
[37:50] my true father's business amen that's
[37:55] right and so God will use the events in
[37:58] your life he'll Drive everyone to their
[38:00] purpose and they can either accept it or
[38:03] reject it if they accept it then they
[38:05] receive that power and then that purpose
[38:07] drives them forward like we know Paul
[38:10] Paul's Paul was driven to his purpose
[38:12] through meeting Christ there on the road
[38:16] to Damascus and then that purpose drove
[38:18] him right yeah that purpose drove him to
[38:23] be and Jesus told him you're gonna be a
[38:24] light to the Gentiles you're gonna turn
[38:26] many from the power of darkness to the
[38:28] power of light and it's that purpose
[38:30] drove him and then Jesus he also heard
[38:33] how Jesus said this man will must suffer
[38:36] great things for my sake
[38:38] remember God told that to Ananias so no
[38:41] doubt Ananias we're told that to Paul
[38:42] you're gonna do great things you're
[38:45] gonna turn men here and turn on the
[38:46] light for many people right you're gonna
[38:47] turn on the light switch or pull the
[38:48] light switch but also you're gonna
[38:51] suffer great things and so when people
[38:54] rise up back of us in different ones
[38:55] would say you're going to Rome to die
[38:57] Paul could be bold and say that's fine
[38:59] that's part of my purpose amen because I
[39:02] persecuted the Church of God I've got to
[39:04] suffer for the Church of God amen
[39:07] and every time Paul got persecuted he
[39:11] wrote it and every time he went jail he
[39:13] wrote about it later saying what
[39:14] encouragement it was to the Saints
[39:17] remember that's it off to preach on that
[39:19] eventually it was such an encouragement
[39:21] to them they they heard of Paul saying
[39:24] faithful yet
[39:25] his bonds and they knew that either real
[39:27] revelation of Christ he didn't sell out
[39:30] and try to baby and try to get out of
[39:33] the the prison sale and baby his way out
[39:35] and he didn't he didn't try to roll back
[39:39] or what's the word day he didn't try to
[39:40] recant that's the word I'm looking for
[39:42] he didn't try to recant say well I'll go
[39:44] back to gym just give me my freedom back
[39:46] I'm gonna be a happy Roman citizen I
[39:48] won't cause all this trouble no he knew
[39:50] the trouble was just the effects of
[39:52] preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ
[39:54] hallelujah and so see Church God uses
[39:58] the events of our lives to drive us to
[40:01] our purpose and then we gotta let that
[40:02] purpose drive us forward now
[40:06] let's look at these metaphors here the
[40:10] chapter is actually called seeing life
[40:11] from God's view but let's look at for
[40:14] metaphors God gives us of our purpose
[40:17] okay the first one is the race and
[40:22] that's the one we just read in Hebrews
[40:23] 12 now Paul talks about running the race
[40:27] as well but but here the Bible says in
[40:29] Romans 12:1 let us lay aside every
[40:32] weight and the sin with which dust so
[40:35] easily beset us and let us run with
[40:37] patience the race that is set before us
[40:40] now you know runners look for every
[40:43] advantage they can get I think the last
[40:45] time the Olympics came around I never
[40:47] watched him but I think I heard online
[40:48] that some fastest guys would shave every
[40:51] little hair on her body any hindrance
[40:55] that would give them just a slight edge
[40:57] to try to go a little faster they'd be
[41:00] willing to do that and you know how
[41:03] immoral it is they strip almost all
[41:05] their clothes off especially the women
[41:06] now or they look like they're running
[41:08] around in bikinis out there onto the
[41:10] track which is a disgrace in the sight
[41:12] of God but they'll take they'll lay
[41:15] aside anyway they'll lay aside anything
[41:17] that even gets close to discouraging
[41:20] them from running their best now how
[41:23] much more church should we apply that
[41:24] spiritually to our lives if we know
[41:27] something's on our phone keep struggle
[41:29] with us how much how quick should we be
[41:32] to get rid of that if we know being
[41:35] around this person at this certain time
[41:37] of the day is going to lead to some
[41:39] awful how much should we avoid that if
[41:42] we know going to that friend's house or
[41:44] that family members house or if we don't
[41:47] listen to that certain music is going to
[41:48] bother it's gonna hinder us how much
[41:50] more we should avoid that we should
[41:53] easily lay aside any weight that we
[41:57] might run the race with perseverance now
[42:04] don't get me wrong there's a difference
[42:05] between laying aside away of sin but
[42:08] then carrying a cross as you run the
[42:11] military I talked to brother Adam rego
[42:13] I've talked to mr. Atkins at and when
[42:19] they train they got to run their mile
[42:20] with the heavy pack on I forget how
[42:22] heavy it was was it fifty pounds or
[42:23] something I forget do you remember me I
[42:25] do okay he might not have been there
[42:27] when we talked about it but maybe it's
[42:28] like a 25 or 50 pound pack and they've
[42:30] got to run their mile race and they got
[42:32] a certain time now that's that's like us
[42:35] as Christians we've got a jesus said you
[42:38] got to take up a cross daily and follow
[42:40] me and so that's part of our Christian
[42:45] race is taking up the cross and carrying
[42:48] the cross and dealing with the same
[42:50] burden every day right but the nice
[42:53] thing is that Christ is there to help us
[42:54] carry it or were we were following his
[42:57] footprint sir we know this is the right
[42:59] Road I'm on the right Road I've got the
[43:01] cross without a cross then you're not
[43:04] doing what God's called you to do you
[43:05] forsake in your ministry you for taking
[43:07] your purpose so there's a balance we
[43:11] must we have to understand there's going
[43:14] to be a burden there's going to be a
[43:15] heavy load as we run but it's a
[43:17] different kind of load than the load of
[43:19] sin because the load of sin brings death
[43:23] oh but the weight of the cross brings
[43:26] joy because jesus said he did it for the
[43:28] joy that was set before him like your
[43:34] life in my life although it's hard
[43:35] although it's we struggle we get weak
[43:37] sometimes there'll be times God will
[43:39] give us great joy they'll come a
[43:42] testimony after you know there'll be
[43:44] great joy finally Oh after all these
[43:45] weeks or all these months or years oh
[43:47] there's a great joy thank God for this
[43:50] joy it was worth it all
[43:52] I wouldn't change it all because there's
[43:54] joy at the end of that but at the end of
[43:57] sin is only death and heartache and torn
[44:00] lives and ruined lives and ruined
[44:03] relationships in church splits and all
[44:05] all these awful things negativity and
[44:09] slander that's the end of sin and death
[44:13] but we at the end get to see joy the joy
[44:17] of the Holy Ghost oh it's a race eh is
[44:22] it not church so the thing is that verse
[44:26] two this is how you got a run see we run
[44:28] and with the cross and our head get so
[44:29] our face just points down and alls we
[44:32] can see is when will I die when I go
[44:35] into heaven or whatever I go to heaven
[44:37] but the Bible said he got lifted Jesus
[44:40] you gotta run with your face after
[44:42] heaven amen
[44:43] looking unto Jesus Jesus is not below
[44:46] Jesus is above amen set your affection
[44:49] on things above so see you as we run the
[44:53] race we gotta keep our eyes on Christ I
[44:56] love that don't you
[44:58] thank you lord if the cross is heavy it
[45:01] will bet it make you bend over from time
[45:04] to time but we must keep our eyes on the
[45:07] Lord Jesus and not love the things of
[45:10] the world or feel sorry for ourselves or
[45:12] oh the world must have it so much better
[45:14] they don't we've got it the best because
[45:18] we've got the fruit of the Spirit praise
[45:20] God we're actually producing something
[45:23] that has value to it while their lives
[45:26] are producing death hell amen
[45:32] alright now let's go I believe it's a
[45:36] first Corinthians 9 let's go there for a
[45:39] scripture about running the race again
[45:41] here's another one I just came to me so
[45:51] I didn't really have a chance to look it
[45:53] up but I'm just you know sort of
[45:54] familiar I imagine yeah
[46:00] first Corinthians 9 look at verse 19
[46:04] let's start a little bit before that
[46:06] this is a thought I've been working with
[46:08] a little bit I may preach it later but
[46:11] this thought of how Paul he was all
[46:13] things to all men so let's read this for
[46:16] a little bit to a Jew he became like a
[46:18] Jew to a slave he became like a slave to
[46:23] a free man he became like a free man and
[46:26] that's interesting I want to just go a
[46:29] little deeper in that and study on that
[46:31] doesn't that sound interesting because
[46:33] in other words God wants us to try to
[46:35] feel the pain or feel the struggle that
[46:39] another person's in he wants us to put
[46:42] ourselves in their shoes not judge them
[46:45] and say well you're just a serpent's
[46:46] eater or you're just not as good as us
[46:49] no but try to feel that their pain and
[46:52] relate to them so you can understand how
[46:55] to win them for though I be free from
[47:00] yet have I made myself a servant unto
[47:02] all that I might gain them more so the
[47:04] way you gain souls is by serving people
[47:07] god help us to do that
[47:10] God show us how to serve people and unto
[47:15] the Jews I became as a Jew that I might
[47:17] gain the Jews to them that are under the
[47:20] law as under the law that I might gain
[47:21] them that are under the law to them that
[47:23] are without the law as without law but
[47:26] not without the law to God there it is
[47:29] right there so Pete so sinners that had
[47:32] no law off he tried to think how would
[47:35] they think but he always kept the law of
[47:37] God that's why people got all mixed up
[47:40] well Jesus ain't with drunkards so I can
[47:42] go into the bar no you're just deceived
[47:45] that's not what Jesus did he went into
[47:47] their homes
[47:49] and then he did probably didn't go into
[47:51] big places like that because he never
[47:53] sinned and and he was always righteous
[47:55] and pure and he created an atmosphere
[47:57] amen
[47:58] he changed the atmosphere I remember he
[48:01] always cried even Mother Mary
[48:03] he even corrupted corrected mother Mary
[48:05] if he corrected mother Mary and Peter
[48:07] how much more a bunch of sinners sitting
[48:09] around at the table that means he was
[48:11] constantly correcting people ever he
[48:13] went but see people use that as an
[48:15] excuse to play pool or listen to dirty
[48:17] music or lust after women or something
[48:19] like that they use excuses like that
[48:21] well uh it's a it's a wedding so I can
[48:24] you know I can get drunk and I can I can
[48:26] dance a worldly music at a wedding not
[48:29] if you're a Christian you can't you see
[48:32] so we got to balance these out here he
[48:36] was still under the law to Christ
[48:39] now did you catch that we're not under
[48:42] law Moses weren't in law of the Holy
[48:44] Spirit people say I'm not under the law
[48:47] well that's true in one way but it's
[48:48] wrong in another it's true yeah we're
[48:51] not under every 613 law of Moses but we
[48:54] are under the law of the Spirit and the
[48:56] law of the Spirit is life in Christ
[48:59] Jesus in other words the Holy Spirit
[49:02] would tell you don't sin obey the law
[49:04] and if you obey the law you walk in the
[49:06] spirit but if you disobey you broke the
[49:09] law of the holy spirit now you breathe
[49:11] the holy spirit and now you got to
[49:12] repent to get back to where you are free
[49:14] from sin that's right
[49:17] so we are under law and I put that in
[49:19] the book hopefully people catch that
[49:20] hope hope that serves people up a little
[49:22] bit we are under a law today amen glory
[49:27] there's rules this this this this law is
[49:30] love but there's also rules to love amen
[49:34] now look at verse finish 21 that I might
[49:38] gain them that are without the law to
[49:41] the week became eyes weak that I might
[49:42] gain the week I have made all things to
[49:44] all men that I might by that all means
[49:46] save some
[49:47] and this I do for the Gospels sake that
[49:51] I might be partaker thereof with you
[49:53] know ye not that they which run in a
[49:56] race run all but one receiveth the prize
[49:59] so one that ye may obtain
[50:03] so you and I have to run the Christian
[50:05] race like we're the only ones who are
[50:08] gonna win
[50:08] isn't that what brother branham said Oh
[50:10] Graham said you've got to have the faith
[50:11] that if if one person goes in the
[50:14] rapture Bride of Christ fellowship it's
[50:15] gonna be me
[50:17] amen if one person goes at Ohio it's
[50:21] gonna be me levan said if your faith is
[50:23] not like that then you've got the wrong
[50:25] kind of faith see we got a run in a way
[50:30] that we are gonna win the race now that
[50:38] I heard you know this it goes way back
[50:39] to college so I'm going back some 15
[50:42] years I heard my friend at college he
[50:44] taught a Bible study and I quote he said
[50:46] I think I'll pass it on just another way
[50:48] to think about it he said this prize was
[50:51] intimacy now we know it's eternal life
[50:52] but he called it intimacy in other words
[50:55] if everybody else around you isn't
[50:57] seeking God that's fine
[50:59] but your prize the reason you want to
[51:01] draw closer to God is the prize of
[51:03] intimacy that I can know him better that
[51:06] I can know Christ better in the powers
[51:09] resurrection and here's the one we don't
[51:11] like the Fellowship of his sufferings
[51:14] praise God so I like that I thought that
[51:19] was intimacy because everybody knows
[51:21] everybody can quote well gosh we've
[51:23] baptized which scripture is here
[51:24] everybody can quote that acts 2:38 what
[51:27] scriptures speaker brother branham
[51:28] everybody can quote that Luke 17:30
[51:30] Malachi 4:5 and everybody can know that
[51:33] but whose intimate with the Holy Spirit
[51:35] today and knows kind of what God is
[51:39] dealing in their lives today and who
[51:42] they're supposed to serve like Paul we
[51:45] must become a servant all in order to
[51:47] gain some but yet while doing that never
[51:49] breaking the law of the Spirit now who's
[51:53] that intimate with the Lord you see so
[51:58] that I thought that was a good
[51:59] illustration of a price let me pull that
[52:04] up real quick before he finished this
[52:06] scripture the fellows
[52:10] of his suffering just I don't forget
[52:13] okay now let's finish first cutting
[52:15] these six no I'm sorry 925 and every man
[52:20] that striveth for the mastery is
[52:22] temperate in all things and they do it
[52:24] to obtain a corruptible crown but we an
[52:25] incorruptible so athletes will put their
[52:29] bodies under great discipline in order
[52:33] to get a prize right college was the
[52:37] most discipline I ever got we would get
[52:39] up and like sometimes in the in the HOF
[52:41] season we get up at 4:30 in order to be
[52:43] at the practice field I'm sorry get up
[52:46] at 4:00 in order being on practice field
[52:47] we start practice at 5 a.m. we practice
[52:50] from 5 to 7 a.m. out in the winter out
[52:53] at the rubber bolt and then get showered
[52:56] up and drive back for class at you know
[52:58] 8:45 or whatever it was and then after
[53:01] class lunch and then films and then a
[53:05] little more practice two practices a day
[53:08] and then do your classwork after that
[53:10] and just just a cycle week after week
[53:13] after week after week that's the most
[53:15] discipline ever had and you know the
[53:19] famous people day they'll have a sugar
[53:21] free diet you know we think that's
[53:22] that's real discipline no sugar for
[53:25] months and months and no sweets and then
[53:28] they have such discipline and they do it
[53:29] just to stay looking young but see we
[53:33] should take that attitude no of course
[53:35] we should take care of our bodies and we
[53:37] can't have sugar and then get cancer
[53:39] from the sugar and say well oh the devil
[53:40] did this to me no you did that to you
[53:43] right did I saw a study this week that
[53:46] said obesity leads to cancer many times
[53:49] and of course everybody knows that but
[53:50] science finally proved it this week so
[53:55] you got to take care of your temple but
[53:57] they're trying to obtain a corruptible
[53:59] crown but we are obtaining an
[54:01] incorruptible crown eternal life a crown
[54:04] that will not fade away
[54:06] Paul's referring to that garden remember
[54:08] that the wreaths they wrap around the
[54:10] winners and the Greek society they they
[54:12] wrap around and Paul would have seen
[54:14] that because they had Olympic Games
[54:16] right there in Corinth or not Olympic
[54:17] but they had these games right there in
[54:19] Corinth he would win the city he would
[54:21] see their games he'd see them put
[54:24] on there they're guarded and everybody's
[54:26] clapping all are so good but all Paul
[54:28] saw that's nonsense but that's just a
[54:30] copycat that's Satan comping what Jesus
[54:33] is going to do for us amen
[54:34] that's just a corrupt and perverted copy
[54:37] of what's gonna happen in heaven amen
[54:41] all the winners of the race are gonna be
[54:45] crowned with eternal life amen
[54:48] so verse 26 therefore so run I run not
[54:53] as uncertainly fight not as one beating
[54:56] the air in other words I know where I'm
[54:59] running and I know who I'm fighting so
[55:02] this is where people struggle when they
[55:04] come to church they don't know where
[55:06] they're running they don't know where
[55:07] they're coming to church they don't know
[55:09] what gifts are in their life they don't
[55:11] know what God's called them to do in
[55:12] their homes or don't know what job or
[55:14] don't know what they don't know they're
[55:15] just running and kind of here to the air
[55:17] not quite sure but ball says work to
[55:20] know where we're running and we did not
[55:23] want to know who we're fighting let me
[55:25] say this before we get then we're not
[55:27] fighting Jeffersonville right we're not
[55:29] fighting you name the church we're not
[55:32] fighting any church we're not fighting
[55:33] organizations
[55:34] we're fighting Satan that's propagating
[55:37] lies behind some of these churches we're
[55:42] not fighting flesh and blood so we can
[55:44] argue we can disagree bitterly but then
[55:46] we should be able to hug and love each
[55:48] other that's right that's right and so
[55:52] it's got to be done with love in our
[55:54] hearts and at the end we can smile shake
[55:57] hands and love and pray we know who
[56:04] we're fighting it's not the individual
[56:06] it's not that city it's not that church
[56:08] it's not that organization that's not it
[56:10] we're fighting the devil verse 27 but I
[56:14] keep under my body and bring it into
[56:15] subjection lest that by any means when i
[56:18] have preached to others preached to
[56:19] others i myself should be a castaway so
[56:25] we don't want to be a castaway means a
[56:27] reprobate which means a rejected mind
[56:29] remember the homosexuals have reprobate
[56:31] minds
[56:31] casteau so in other words I don't want
[56:33] to be a castaway God's just done with me
[56:36] Paul says if I don't stay steer
[56:38] spiritually disciplined I can be a
[56:40] castaway if I don't keep my prayer life
[56:42] right if I don't keep my Bible reading
[56:44] right if I don't lay aside these sinful
[56:46] temptations that easily slow me down if
[56:49] I don't lay them aside I could be a
[56:51] castaway God could cast me away we don't
[56:55] want to be like that we wouldn't be
[56:58] winners of the race praise God amen
[57:02] we want to be winners of the race we
[57:05] want to follow all God's rules and win
[57:07] the race now go to Philippians 3:10 now
[57:23] this is a beautiful portion why don't we
[57:24] just read 3 7 this is one of the most
[57:26] sweetest portions of scripture Paul's
[57:29] testimony about suffering the loss of
[57:31] all things that he might gain Christ but
[57:35] what things were gain to me those I
[57:37] counted loss for Christ
[57:40] yayyyy doubtless and I count all things
[57:42] but loss for the excellency of the
[57:44] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for
[57:47] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[57:48] things and do count them but dung that I
[57:52] may win Christ and be found in him not
[57:55] having my own righteousness which is a
[57:58] law but that which is through the faith
[58:00] of Christ the righteousness which is of
[58:02] God by faith here it is that I may know
[58:05] him see we only know him right this is
[58:08] the reward knowing him better on this
[58:10] side and the power is resurrection right
[58:14] they got for that we want to see more
[58:16] power of Christ and here's where we
[58:20] struggle and the Fellowship of his
[58:24] sufferings being made conformable unto
[58:27] his death so hope you see that one way
[58:34] to know Christ is to partake of his own
[58:38] sufferings Jesus why do I got to be
[58:41] rejected why don't have to be made fun
[58:43] of and mocked what have to be ridiculed
[58:46] why do I have to be
[58:48] abandoned you have to be abandoned or
[58:51] ridiculed or mocked or go through awful
[58:53] trials in order that you might know
[58:56] Christ in his suffering to relate a
[59:00] little bit to what Jesus felt then you
[59:05] can be made conformable unto his death
[59:09] how'd he die he died as a servant he
[59:13] died as an innocent lamb and that's how
[59:16] God wants us to end our lives right that
[59:20] when we die if God terry's and we go to
[59:23] the grave we died as a meek innocent
[59:26] little lamb amen because we he allowed
[59:31] us to suffer and he taught us obedience
[59:33] through the things that we suffered
[59:38] everybody everybody wants those first
[59:39] two I want to know
[59:41] I'll give me revelation give me the
[59:43] power but they don't always leave out
[59:45] that last one know that maybe a partaker
[59:48] of your sufferings oh thank you lord
[59:54] I love verse 11 if by any means so no
[59:58] matter how whatever it takes that I
[1:00:00] might obtain unto the resurrection of
[1:00:02] the Dead program interprets this force
[1:00:04] in the church age book Paul saying so by
[1:00:07] any means I might be in the rapture the
[1:00:09] first resurrection because everybody's
[1:00:12] going to be in one of the resurrections
[1:00:13] everybody so this has to mean the first
[1:00:16] resurrection you'll either be
[1:00:18] resurrected for the rapture or
[1:00:19] resurrected for the white throne
[1:00:21] judgment I don't know I don't know how
[1:00:23] to I'd rather meet Jesus in the air than
[1:00:25] meet Jesus on as a judge sitting on a
[1:00:28] white throne in front of me I'd rather
[1:00:30] meet him in the air as his wife and then
[1:00:33] when the white throne comes I'm already
[1:00:35] sitting way behind him on a throne - yes
[1:00:38] Jesus that's right yes sir I want to
[1:00:42] meet them in the air and say hallelujah
[1:00:43] I believe that you're coming back I've
[1:00:46] prepared my whole life to meet you in
[1:00:48] the air amen and then also I got news I
[1:00:51] just got to sit behind the Great Lord so
[1:00:53] you guys hear that
[1:00:54] remember when you preach that in our
[1:00:55] church that's right and they say I need
[1:00:59] a witness from there to see an aged
[1:01:00] would you stand up
[1:01:02] if you serve God admits his sufferings
[1:01:03] and God will call brother Jesse will you
[1:01:06] stand up because remember he's gonna do
[1:01:08] that he's gonna say Queen of Sheba stand
[1:01:10] up there's any witnesses men of Nineveh
[1:01:13] stand up and God's gonna call your name
[1:01:16] and God's gonna call my name it ought to
[1:01:19] be a faithful witness right now praise
[1:01:20] God I want to know him in the power of
[1:01:23] his resurrection I want to know him but
[1:01:26] I also have to be able to know him in
[1:01:28] the Fellowship of his sufferings and you
[1:01:32] know what that Fellowship is church
[1:01:33] it's Jesus coming when we get up to
[1:01:36] heaven at the marriage supper but if the
[1:01:38] Bible says it Jesus comes up and he
[1:01:40] wipes away the tears from our eyes
[1:01:44] because we've suffered because we and
[1:01:46] maybe brother Anderson will be
[1:01:47] disappointed some didn't make it Jesus
[1:01:50] will have to come and wipe away tears
[1:01:51] and maybe put an arm around us there
[1:01:54] there it's okay I lost you know I lost
[1:01:59] the son of perdition he can relate to us
[1:02:02] those that were with him he called him
[1:02:04] friend he was this for Judas was Jesus
[1:02:07] friend and he lost him the Fellowship of
[1:02:10] his sufferings being made conformable
[1:02:15] unto his death to die like a little lamb
[1:02:19] little mystery lamb isn't that how
[1:02:24] brother Branham died is a little mystery
[1:02:25] to Lamb
[1:02:26] everybody forsook him out in Arizona he
[1:02:29] got no invitations to preach from any
[1:02:30] church out there they don't want nothing
[1:02:32] to do with him because of his servers he
[1:02:33] doctrine and all that all women hate his
[1:02:35] women hating preaching which it's women
[1:02:37] loving preaching right loving the way
[1:02:40] God made a woman loving the way God made
[1:02:43] a man and he died as a lamb a rejected
[1:02:47] little lamb that's how he died I was
[1:02:50] talking to my friend last Saturday on
[1:02:52] the phone and I was praying lord help me
[1:02:55] to share the message with my friend and
[1:02:56] I said I said oh yeah you said 1965 I
[1:02:59] said yeah that's when our prophet went
[1:03:01] off the scene and I said you died in a
[1:03:03] car accident and I said but he saw
[1:03:05] visions he was a mighty man of God you
[1:03:08] know what his response was well he must
[1:03:11] have not had a vision that day that he
[1:03:12] was gonna died I said well no sir I said
[1:03:16] I said sometimes God takes people on
[1:03:19] certain ways
[1:03:20] I said you know you know I gave him some
[1:03:23] examples of other people that God let go
[1:03:26] through hard times and see that's how
[1:03:29] the world the carnal mind will think of
[1:03:31] that but in God's eyes it wasn't like
[1:03:34] that at all God was conforming him to
[1:03:36] die like Christ as a rejected humble
[1:03:41] meek little lamb because the Bible says
[1:03:44] we are made conformable unto his death
[1:03:50] that's right if by any means I might
[1:03:56] make the rapture praise God
[1:03:59] how many would say that tonight lord
[1:04:01] help me to know you your power and your
[1:04:03] sufferings so by any means I can go in
[1:04:05] the rapture
[1:04:06] that's what Paul that's what Paul wrote
[1:04:10] all right so that's the first one now
[1:04:12] the second one actually let me read this
[1:04:16] this is a good thought here I want to
[1:04:17] read right out of the book here because
[1:04:18] I'm not supposed to put this on a neat
[1:04:20] electronic device I don't want to break
[1:04:21] the law he said the way you see your
[1:04:26] life shaped your life how you define
[1:04:30] life determines your destiny your
[1:04:33] perspective will influence how you
[1:04:34] invest your time spend your money use
[1:04:37] your talents and value your
[1:04:38] relationships all through your attitude
[1:04:41] all through your perspective or what
[1:04:43] your life really is he gives some
[1:04:49] examples how people see their lives this
[1:04:51] is kind of funny he said people call
[1:04:53] their lives how I used to your life as a
[1:04:54] circus my life is a circus wouldn't that
[1:04:58] be so sad if you thought your life was a
[1:05:00] circus one little trick after another
[1:05:03] that would be awful
[1:05:05] but people told this man my life's like
[1:05:07] a circus one joke after another he said
[1:05:12] some people say my life is like a
[1:05:13] minefield I walk around I'm try not to
[1:05:17] step on a mine and get blown up wouldn't
[1:05:20] that be an awful way to see your life
[1:05:23] I'm just trying not to
[1:05:24] blown up the Bible says were more than
[1:05:29] conquerors in Christ Jesus amen
[1:05:31] now their trap set for sure but it's not
[1:05:34] going to take our life nothing's gonna
[1:05:36] take our life until it's Jesus time for
[1:05:38] us to come home some people say I see my
[1:05:42] life as a roller coaster you ever heard
[1:05:43] that oh my life is just up and down ups
[1:05:46] and downs we're brother have said it
[1:05:48] shouldn't be that way a Christian should
[1:05:50] live more holy and holy every day should
[1:05:52] be the same living in the Shekinah glory
[1:05:54] of Christ some some people call their
[1:06:00] life a puzzle my life is like a puzzle
[1:06:02] I really want this to fit it's just not
[1:06:04] fitting I can't you make this I can't
[1:06:06] make this to look right brother branham
[1:06:08] said that's how the denominations do
[1:06:10] right he said they put a cow on top of a
[1:06:12] tree doing some other things you know
[1:06:15] that I forget I read the quota over last
[1:06:17] year they got their puzzle all mixed up
[1:06:21] oh my some people say my laugh at life
[1:06:27] is like a dance or a journey or a
[1:06:28] symphony my life is like a carousel
[1:06:31] sometimes I'm up and down we read the
[1:06:33] carousels last year at Kennywood
[1:06:34] remember that girls up and down up and
[1:06:37] down on the carousel just around and
[1:06:40] around not getting anywhere just around
[1:06:42] and around I'm going on the same every
[1:06:44] every month I got to do the same thing
[1:06:46] it's just up and down up and down church
[1:06:49] our life is not a carousel see some
[1:07:01] people think
[1:07:02] is like a party right you've heard your
[1:07:04] sinner friends say that Oh life is just
[1:07:06] a party live it up if your life is like
[1:07:10] a party then your your only value having
[1:07:13] fun so this is how your your idea about
[1:07:16] life shapes your decisions well my life
[1:07:18] is a party I might as well live it up
[1:07:20] now I'm well I'm young so what's our
[1:07:27] view of life is it a minefield I'm just
[1:07:32] walking a minefield
[1:07:33] off I go to church if someone's gonna
[1:07:35] blow up in my face
[1:07:36] this pastor's gonna blow up in my face
[1:07:38] again I hope that never happens do we
[1:07:44] see it as a minefield because well how
[1:07:45] do we see life shapes of our decisions
[1:07:48] shapes everything so as we said the
[1:07:52] Bible offers four metaphors the first
[1:07:54] one's a race if you see it as a race
[1:07:56] then always you have the new church is
[1:07:58] just keep running made a pretty good lap
[1:08:02] this time we made it through 2018 praise
[1:08:05] look let's pick up the pace a little bit
[1:08:07] for 2019
[1:08:08] sorry and all you got to do is just lay
[1:08:12] lay aside anything that's hindering you
[1:08:15] I've been carrying this pack of guilt of
[1:08:18] 2018 Oh God forgive me you can lay the
[1:08:22] pack down oh it's a lot easier to run
[1:08:24] now thank you lord amen
[1:08:25] oh my it's silly but it's true people
[1:08:31] will hold on the weights for years
[1:08:33] trying to run the Christian waste and
[1:08:36] wonder why they don't get anywhere
[1:08:38] my parents my mom and dad both got
[1:08:41] weights they tell me they just told me
[1:08:42] last time on the phone with my mom about
[1:08:44] weights they're still holding on to
[1:08:46] trying to run the Christian race and
[1:08:49] that's why sometimes Church that's why
[1:08:50] even message people can't get anywhere
[1:08:52] with God because they're so bogged down
[1:08:54] by all their weights helpless
[1:09:03] with the help of Jesus tonight give me
[1:09:05] about 20 more minutes I'll hear try to
[1:09:06] be mindful the time the second one is
[1:09:12] the test God offers us to look at life
[1:09:16] as a test other words might be trial
[1:09:20] temptation or like a refiners test right
[1:09:24] how gold is refined or it's tested to
[1:09:28] make sure it's the right kind of quality
[1:09:31] how many of them are Abraham's tests
[1:09:33] with Isaac he was tested God said I'm
[1:09:37] gonna test you do you love me more than
[1:09:40] my blessings are you serving me because
[1:09:43] you love me or you serve me because I
[1:09:45] blessed you God tested Jacob right he
[1:09:53] worked seven years for Rachel oh they
[1:09:57] even pulled a quick one on him on our
[1:09:58] work seven more tested him in church we
[1:10:05] got to be able to pass the test Adam and
[1:10:09] Eve failed their tests in the Garden of
[1:10:10] Eden did they fail the test can you keep
[1:10:15] all the Word of God in Heaven's and the
[1:10:19] Russians they haven't but in the earthly
[1:10:21] Garden of Eden can you keep all God's
[1:10:23] Word and they couldn't keep it and yet
[1:10:25] then God turns around and asks us to
[1:10:28] keep all the Word of God in Satan's Eden
[1:10:30] but let me tell you the bride's gonna do
[1:10:32] it hey that's right Adam Eve couldn't do
[1:10:36] it because they weren't born again even
[1:10:38] in an earthly perfect Eden but we can do
[1:10:41] it in Satan's Eden because we've got the
[1:10:44] power of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:10:46] I remember church this message if you
[1:10:49] remember this this is the message that
[1:10:52] God had in heaven and the angels one two
[1:10:56] looking so bad
[1:10:57] can you imagine that the BIOS that the
[1:10:59] Angels desired to look in God's seven
[1:11:01] sealed book God's book is there in
[1:11:05] heaven it's got seven seals and the
[1:11:06] Angels just look at it I'd like to see
[1:11:09] what God's gonna do we've had all these
[1:11:11] years with the Jews and Moses and
[1:11:13] Solomon I wonder what God is going to do
[1:11:16] Oh hallelujah they're just chomping at
[1:11:20] the bit I really like to look into that
[1:11:22] book wouldn't you Gabriel yeah Michael I
[1:11:24] told you that about 8,000 years ago now
[1:11:28] of course they wouldn't say that like
[1:11:29] that but remember that's our three dead
[1:11:31] that's I think that's first Peter
[1:11:32] chapter one
[1:11:35] yeah first Peter chapter one nope
[1:11:53] let me look it up here okay verse 12
[1:11:57] thank you sweet thank you I appreciate
[1:11:58] that thank you that's a great blessing
[1:12:01] now unto whom it was revealed actually
[1:12:05] the speaking of Christ's crucifixion
[1:12:07] resurrection under whom it was revealed
[1:12:09] that not under themselves but unto us
[1:12:11] they did minister the things which are
[1:12:13] now reported unto you by them that have
[1:12:16] preached the gospel unto you by the I'm
[1:12:19] sorry with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[1:12:20] heaven which things the angels desire to
[1:12:24] look into oh my and that amazing the
[1:12:28] angels desire to look into those things
[1:12:33] that's awesome
[1:12:36] they wanted to see what is it all about
[1:12:38] what are these seven seals all about
[1:12:41] what is it now Church because they would
[1:12:45] see - they would see you know that they
[1:12:47] would they would minister to Gideon they
[1:12:49] would minister to Abraham and and they
[1:12:51] would see these guys die and they would
[1:12:52] not come in heaven where are these guys
[1:12:54] at and they knew they were in the heart
[1:12:56] of the earth how is God gonna get these
[1:12:58] guys up here they deserve to be in
[1:13:01] heaven but because they sit and sin debt
[1:13:04] wasn't paid for they had to stay in the
[1:13:06] heart of the earth and they desired to
[1:13:09] look into these things ha ha
[1:13:10] hallelujah and one day God sent his son
[1:13:13] right and they saw the sudden crucified
[1:13:17] and instead of coming up he went down
[1:13:20] amen and brother have said he defeated
[1:13:23] every devil on the way down there he
[1:13:25] kicked the door down took the keys of
[1:13:27] death and hell
[1:13:28] come follow me boys and Abraham said can
[1:13:30] we make a pit stop
[1:13:32] and Jesus said of course let's stop
[1:13:34] right there in Jerusalem amen
[1:13:36] and pretty soon after the resurrection
[1:13:39] he comes all up and he said it said open
[1:13:41] up he heavenly gates and they said who
[1:13:44] is the king and glory and they all
[1:13:45] shouted the Lord mighty in battle amen
[1:13:48] and then heavens all open they all come
[1:13:52] in and the angels say this is what it's
[1:13:54] all about
[1:13:54] praise God the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:13:57] blood of God's own son was going to
[1:14:00] redeem and redeem them from the pits
[1:14:02] near the pits of hell and bring them up
[1:14:05] in the prints of God and give them
[1:14:07] action place higher than the Angels amen
[1:14:10] because they're more than servants
[1:14:12] they're bribed they're more than
[1:14:17] servants their family hallelujah the
[1:14:21] Angels desire I wonder what they were
[1:14:24] thinking in 1963 when the seals were
[1:14:26] open they desired what do these seals
[1:14:29] mean what are these symbols God and God
[1:14:31] never revealed it to them but he
[1:14:33] revealed it to a prophet and now he's
[1:14:37] revealed to us that we might overcome by
[1:14:40] the Eagle anointing praise God and be
[1:14:42] overcomers in this hour hallelujah that
[1:14:46] we might be made ready for Jesus as
[1:14:47] second coming oh hi oh yeah praise God
[1:14:52] which things that angels desire to look
[1:14:55] into Oh mine now of course there's one
[1:15:02] thing that all of us desire look into
[1:15:03] when is that day an hour of the coming
[1:15:06] of the Lord
[1:15:07] when is that rapture going to be but
[1:15:09] Jesus said I don't even know that only
[1:15:12] the eternal spirit knows that the
[1:15:15] eternal spirit did not let the flesh
[1:15:16] know did not let the veil know and the
[1:15:19] Angels want to know but bo-ram said once
[1:15:23] the angels he said once Jesus gets that
[1:15:25] different robe on with the paps and
[1:15:26] everything like that once he steps off
[1:15:28] that throne then all the Angels gonna
[1:15:30] say he's ready he's he's gonna come now
[1:15:34] it's time for the rapture and the angels
[1:15:39] will see it first but guess what Christ
[1:15:41] will let us know
[1:15:42] the Bible said we'll know the times and
[1:15:44] seasons amen that's why I want to preach
[1:15:46] out and pretty soon remember the Bible
[1:15:48] said you need not know the times or
[1:15:50] season because you yourself know that
[1:15:52] the Lord comes as a thief in the night
[1:15:55] amen in other words we know the time and
[1:15:59] season will feel it will have that right
[1:16:01] in our souls will feel it oh the Lord is
[1:16:03] going to come soon
[1:16:04] why because we'll see the latter rain
[1:16:06] and bromance say we'll see our loved
[1:16:09] ones for about a month or 40 days that's
[1:16:11] how we'll know to praise God everything
[1:16:14] will be letting us know the people of
[1:16:16] God will know everybody else it'll be
[1:16:18] like a thief they weren't expecting it
[1:16:19] but it won't be a thief to us because
[1:16:21] we'll be the ones that were know we're
[1:16:23] gonna get taken up we're the ones
[1:16:25] getting snatched up we are what Christ
[1:16:27] is coming back for amen
[1:16:29] he's gonna let us know before he takes
[1:16:31] us that's right so the second one life
[1:16:37] is a test enough after finish with this
[1:16:38] one God is continually testing your
[1:16:44] character and my character he wants to
[1:16:47] see how much faith we have how much
[1:16:49] obedience we have how much love and
[1:16:51] integrity and loyalty we have he's
[1:16:54] constantly testing us
[1:16:56] because he wants us to be more loyal he
[1:16:58] wants a hat he wants us to have more
[1:17:00] integrity he wants just to really love
[1:17:02] one another so he tests us do you really
[1:17:06] love your brother do you really love
[1:17:08] your sister it'll let a little tests
[1:17:11] come in to see if we really love them
[1:17:13] how many want to pass those tests I want
[1:17:17] to run a good race I don't want to be
[1:17:18] bogged down I want to run the fastest
[1:17:20] time I can the fastest time I ran was
[1:17:23] like a ten six I think that was pretty
[1:17:26] good for high school I want to run
[1:17:27] faster than that
[1:17:28] I'm gonna run I don't run this fast my
[1:17:30] personal time I want to do is in a blink
[1:17:33] of an eye because the Bible said you'll
[1:17:35] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[1:17:37] of an eye I know I'm gonna have a
[1:17:40] personal record when these days for the
[1:17:41] air I'm gonna have a PR one of these
[1:17:43] days I'm gonna be 10-6 by longshot and
[1:17:47] brother says it's not even badly batting

[1:17:53] then just a little twinkle
[1:17:55] I'm gonna run a lot more than 100 meters
[1:17:57] I'm gonna run to the air praise God amen
[1:18:00] amen we have said that we're running so
[1:18:02] far we weren't even past the Milky Way
[1:18:07] what a race we should run that's right
[1:18:13] we don't need to because we are the moon
[1:18:15] glory will go so fast right past that
[1:18:19] we'll travel like a thought we'll travel
[1:18:24] like light because that's the fastest
[1:18:26] thing there is in the universe light
[1:18:28] jesus said you are the light you are the
[1:18:31] light of the world hallelujah Oh God
[1:18:35] helped me to be ready amen
[1:18:37] help me to have loyalty integrity and
[1:18:40] love obedience character faith let me
[1:18:44] have that even if it costs much
[1:18:47] suffering let me be conformed to the
[1:18:49] image of Christ give me a few more
[1:18:56] minutes here like to take a few more
[1:18:58] thoughts I see the nice part is it's
[1:19:00] like I already just I just wrote my own
[1:19:02] thoughts all over this book so it's like
[1:19:04] my sermon notes are already right here I
[1:19:05] just gotta look at my notes so it's
[1:19:08] different usually I type out my notes
[1:19:09] and put them up here but here I just
[1:19:10] kind of wrote out Oh make sure you
[1:19:12] preach this this this ties this with
[1:19:14] with that that think of how all these
[1:19:18] people all these believers pass their
[1:19:21] tests like with Jove I've been reading
[1:19:24] through drobe now I'm at the part where
[1:19:26] allah who is rebuking job and job is
[1:19:29] like elihue's like speak up job if I'm
[1:19:32] wrong and job don't say nothing he says
[1:19:34] you made me said you justified yourself
[1:19:37] more than God that's what Joe was saying
[1:19:41] something's wrong with God God's not
[1:19:42] defending me I'm a righteous man and
[1:19:44] member Joe repented at the end of that
[1:19:46] he was wrong Joe made it sound like
[1:19:49] something's wrong with God God's not
[1:19:50] giving justice and Allah who rebuked him
[1:19:53] for that see it's like Joe was he was
[1:19:56] starting to fail the test but all of a
[1:19:58] sudden God raised his faith and God came
[1:19:59] to help him out he was having struggles
[1:20:02] my medals oh it was should have been
[1:20:05] better than I've never been born and
[1:20:06] that's not God that's not
[1:20:07] wanted them to do and then there was
[1:20:10] times he would get an encouragement I
[1:20:11] know my redeemer lives the lightning
[1:20:13] flashes thunder rolls he getting Karen
[1:20:16] now standing with him on that day but
[1:20:18] there was times he got down but God
[1:20:21] ended up ended him up helping him pass
[1:20:23] the test I know God's gonna help you and
[1:20:26] I pass the test - if God help brother
[1:20:29] man pass the test he's gonna help us
[1:20:31] pass the test
[1:20:32] Joseph passed the test twelve eleven
[1:20:35] brothers getting rid of him right we're
[1:20:37] not all eleven but most him want to get
[1:20:38] rid of him he passed the test of being
[1:20:41] away from his family of being thrown in
[1:20:42] prison and even being approached by a
[1:20:45] woman right he passed that test along
[1:20:49] with the beautiful woman coming on to
[1:20:51] him and trying to seduce him he even
[1:20:54] passed that test and said how can I do
[1:20:56] this evil not just to your husband but
[1:20:58] to God so God spirit was so close to
[1:21:01] Joseph how could I do this physical
[1:21:03] lustful act when God is right here with
[1:21:05] me Amen that's what we need hallelujah
[1:21:08] how could I say evil how could I think
[1:21:10] any lustful thoughts when the Holy
[1:21:12] Spirit's in my soul praise God Amen
[1:21:15] that's what we need we need the
[1:21:17] character to pass the test
[1:21:20] in fact church character is both
[1:21:25] developed and revealed by tests so in
[1:21:29] every test it helps your character get
[1:21:32] better but by also showing what your
[1:21:34] characters like it reveals what kind of
[1:21:37] character you have right our trial
[1:21:44] show what we're made of if we fall out
[1:21:46] the pride that it shows we weren't
[1:21:48] strong enough and we got to get stronger
[1:21:50] if we follow the lost that shows well we
[1:21:53] weren't strong enough there we've got to
[1:21:55] get stronger but we overcome lost
[1:21:57] overcome pride overcome all these fears
[1:22:00] and struggles and all these if we
[1:22:02] overcome that it shows we've grown as
[1:22:04] Christians amen and we're further up the
[1:22:07] road today than we were last year ah
[1:22:12] thank you Lord you are always being
[1:22:16] tested by God let me read this I got a
[1:22:18] few more minutes this is beautiful I
[1:22:19] just put a star this is great I got to
[1:22:21] read this word for word listen you don't
[1:22:25] know all the tests God will give you but
[1:22:28] you can predict some of them based upon
[1:22:30] the Bible you can know what kind of what
[1:22:32] tests you're gonna have you're gonna be
[1:22:35] tested by major changes Joseph went
[1:22:37] through a major change he didn't expect
[1:22:38] to be thrown into a pit church think
[1:22:42] about it he was walking the glory of
[1:22:43] vision he just saw a vision everybody's
[1:22:46] bound down to me my God's gonna help me
[1:22:48] a rule and then the next day he's thrown
[1:22:50] in a pit and he's off as a slave where
[1:22:53] and it never sees his brothers you're
[1:22:54] gonna go through major some of us will
[1:22:56] go through major changes but we've got
[1:22:59] to have godly character in the midst of
[1:23:00] that test things we don't expect to
[1:23:03] happen but we got to have godly
[1:23:05] character the next thing is something we
[1:23:09] all started with delayed promises well
[1:23:12] God I thought you promised me to heal me
[1:23:14] I thought you promised to save my family
[1:23:16] and the church said I thought you
[1:23:19] promised a new America for me I thought
[1:23:22] you did and God's like yeah why are you
[1:23:24] getting so upset about it I'm trying to
[1:23:27] develop patience in you I'm trying to
[1:23:29] get you to produce some patience
[1:23:31] well I supposed to be right now the
[1:23:33] preacher made it sound like it was now
[1:23:35] well how do you know it was a preacher
[1:23:36] and not your misunderstanding well my
[1:23:40] mom made it sound like this or my dad
[1:23:42] made it sound like this or grandmother
[1:23:44] made it sound like this and Abraham
[1:23:48] didn't know Church Abraham didn't know
[1:23:50] was gonna be 25 years he didn't know
[1:23:53] that that's just what God allowed it to
[1:23:55] go through
[1:23:56] Joel didn't know it was going to be
[1:23:58] months but it was many long months with
[1:24:02] skin boils and not being able to sleep
[1:24:04] all through the night and losing his
[1:24:06] family and losing his money and losing
[1:24:08] his respect even from church members how
[1:24:14] many months sometimes do we have to go
[1:24:15] through of hard trials and we think
[1:24:18] where's God at he's here the whole time
[1:24:22] he's here the whole time he was with
[1:24:26] Joseph the whole time he was with job
[1:24:28] the whole time he was with brother
[1:24:30] Brandon the whole time he'll be with us
[1:24:32] the whole time
[1:24:34] you'll get tested by major change is
[1:24:36] delayed promises impossible problems
[1:24:41] like Abraham and Sarah's age how could
[1:24:43] they ever do anything about that how am
[1:24:45] I gonna have a baby I'm 90 years old
[1:24:47] well actually 89 at that point she
[1:24:50] laughed how am I gonna have a baby I'm
[1:24:52] 89 years old how can God do what I'm
[1:24:55] asking him to do yesterday it's
[1:24:58] ridiculous how that happened and then
[1:25:01] they named Isaac laughter that's his
[1:25:03] name laughter so God can remind them you
[1:25:06] laugh but I gave you a laugh of joy
[1:25:07] afterwards I change your mocking right
[1:25:11] or your unbelief I turn your unbelief
[1:25:13] into belief amen unanswered prayers you
[1:25:19] have to might have to go through some
[1:25:20] unanswered prayers
[1:25:21] remember Hebrews 11 read it last week
[1:25:23] they so many of them died not inheriting
[1:25:26] the promise they didn't get to see the
[1:25:29] Messiah they were all sacrificing for
[1:25:31] the Messiah believing the Messiah is
[1:25:33] going to come I know you didn't come
[1:25:35] then come in their lifetime undeserved
[1:25:40] criticism and senseless tragedies I
[1:25:47] didn't deserve this why is this
[1:25:49] happening why is such a tragedy I've
[1:25:52] lost my closest friends senseless it
[1:25:56] seems but it's not because God works
[1:25:59] everything according to his great plan
[1:26:01] his great sovereign plan
[1:26:10] Church when we understand that life is a
[1:26:13] test I'm gonna read this right out of
[1:26:14] here you realize that nothing is
[1:26:18] insignificant in your life everything is
[1:26:21] significant in your life every stage of
[1:26:24] Joseph's life was significant it was
[1:26:28] preparing him for what was next
[1:26:30] so church think about it what is this
[1:26:32] current stage what's this season
[1:26:33] preparing you for God will show you
[1:26:37] right either now or afterwards he's
[1:26:41] going to show you
[1:26:42] Joseph could know because he had the
[1:26:44] vision oh I'm gonna rule or my brother's
[1:26:46] gonna bow down before me
[1:26:48] my dad's gonna bow down before me he
[1:26:52] knew somehow that's going to be a part
[1:26:54] of it we may not know but we've got to
[1:26:56] trust God's sovereignty amen that God is
[1:26:59] sovereign
[1:26:59] he'll mate he'll make all the events
[1:27:01] happen for a purpose there's a time and
[1:27:03] season for everything and I just got to
[1:27:06] be obedient in the time and season
[1:27:13] everything
[1:27:15] significant in your life now this is
[1:27:20] beautiful the good news about the test
[1:27:23] is that God will not give you a test you
[1:27:26] can't pass Amen hallelujah as a teacher
[1:27:31] as far as I know I've never given a
[1:27:32] student a test they couldn't pass I
[1:27:33] tried to prepare them I gave them all
[1:27:35] the information I could possibly do how
[1:27:37] much more is God gonna do that for us he
[1:27:43] will not give us a test it's impossible
[1:27:46] for us to pass he promised it and first
[1:27:48] Corinthians 10:13 and then church when
[1:27:53] you pass it so he prepares you for the
[1:27:55] test you pass it then he rewards you for
[1:27:57] passing it that's what the Bible says
[1:28:03] James 1:12 let's read that Hebrews 1:2
[1:28:20] of blessed is a man that endureth the
[1:28:23] test just got to get through the test
[1:28:26] for when he is tried he should receive
[1:28:29] the crown of life which the LORD hath
[1:28:31] promised to them that love him so I'm
[1:28:34] not going to give you a test you can't
[1:28:36] pass but then when you pass it you get a
[1:28:38] great reward glory now that to me that
[1:28:42] sounds like a loving Heavenly Father
[1:28:44] that doesn't find it sound like a cruel
[1:28:46] God or a cruel judge that sounds like a
[1:28:49] got grace in mercy
[1:28:50] let's stand to our feet here the last
[1:28:55] scriptures of what William was still
[1:28:57] with us here I think I preached the
[1:28:58] whole sermon kind of on this thought go
[1:29:00] to 2nd chronicles 32 31 if you got your
[1:29:02] Bibles I'll stop right here have you
[1:29:08] enjoyed the Word of God tonight
[1:29:10] amen it's just a good reminder to me all
[1:29:12] these thoughts coming together we've got
[1:29:14] to look at our lives through one of
[1:29:15] these metaphors one of these views
[1:29:18] because this is how God views your life
[1:29:22] it's not a roller coaster
[1:29:24] you're just not hanging on for dear life
[1:29:26] like we went to the roller coasters last
[1:29:28] year acacia was hanging on for dear life
[1:29:29] and that 95 mile or 80 90 mile per hour
[1:29:33] a roller coaster
[1:29:33] so was I location we were both hanging
[1:29:35] on for dear life that's that that's that
[1:29:39] you don't see roller coaster in God's
[1:29:40] Bible do you life is just a roller
[1:29:44] coaster just hang on try not to get
[1:29:46] trying to fall off
[1:29:50] no God clearly calls it a race that you
[1:29:56] can win God calls it a test that he
[1:29:59] knows you can pass this is not too hard
[1:30:05] second chronicles first ascent
[1:30:07] chronicles 30 to 31
[1:30:10] you got that Lydia you got that oh it's
[1:30:14] a cowboy I'll get it I just thought
[1:30:15] maybe somebody had here 10 chronicles 32
[1:30:17] 31 I preached the whole sermon when
[1:30:19] brother William was here I remember that
[1:30:21] on a Sunday night
[1:30:27] I'll be in the business of the
[1:30:29] ambassador's of the princes of Babylon
[1:30:31] who sent unto him to inquire the wonder
[1:30:34] that was done in the land God left him
[1:30:36] to try him that he might know all that
[1:30:38] was in his heart remember when I
[1:30:40] preached that you didn't remember that
[1:30:42] God left Hezekiah to see what was in his
[1:30:46] heart God kind of stepped back a little
[1:30:47] bit well let's see if my anointing
[1:30:50] leaves him let's see how he acts
[1:30:52] remember Church this was after Hezekiah
[1:30:56] got sick the Bible said he threw his
[1:30:57] hands against the walls like give me
[1:30:59] there are 15 more years and God gave it
[1:31:02] to him but then God left him and said
[1:31:05] let's see how he acts now and we all
[1:31:08] know what happened the Babylonian
[1:31:10] princess came in said oh would it be
[1:31:12] okay if the Catholic Church look at the
[1:31:14] great things of God can you show us all
[1:31:16] your mysteries and and can we see all
[1:31:18] the vessels of God and he has get has it
[1:31:23] guys like sure he's all prideful yeah
[1:31:25] come on and you can you can touch and
[1:31:27] and see all the lower lash I'll show you
[1:31:29] all these mysteries and the Bible said
[1:31:31] don't cast your pearls before swine and
[1:31:35] because of that as a kind I'd was God
[1:31:39] angry at him he got so exalted and
[1:31:42] lifted up he let unclean people go into
[1:31:45] a clean and holy place that's not how it
[1:31:49] works in those days you had to be clean
[1:31:51] to come in a church the same thing could
[1:31:54] be for us Oh somebody that they're kind
[1:31:56] of like a they kind of act like a
[1:31:58] believer oh but but yeah you're part of
[1:32:01] the church you can do communion and you
[1:32:03] can do everything with us and find out
[1:32:05] later they're not really they don't
[1:32:07] treat it as reverently as they ought to
[1:32:09] or be some of something like this oh
[1:32:11] you're new the church oh you can come
[1:32:13] and you can preach right away you just
[1:32:14] you're right in the right in the faith
[1:32:16] oh you can come right up to the piano
[1:32:18] and you you can just have a position
[1:32:20] here or you can ride away you can be a
[1:32:22] Deaconess oh yeah yeah you're right in
[1:32:24] there and they're not they haven't
[1:32:26] proved a holy life yet so God left him
[1:32:30] to try him now the thing with us
[1:32:32] churches like this brother Branham said
[1:32:34] when he lied he said there's like a
[1:32:39] black sheet that came down between him
[1:32:41] God and God had done talking to him I
[1:32:43] don't remember that but at the same time
[1:32:47] the Bible said he was sealed with the
[1:32:49] Holy Ghost unto the day of his
[1:32:51] Redemption so what does that mean it
[1:32:54] means he's got three parts soul body
[1:32:57] spirit and so God cut off the anointing
[1:33:00] from his body and the spirit
[1:33:03] but not the soul right because God said
[1:33:07] I'll never leave you or forsake you
[1:33:08] that's what Hebrews 13 says so God took
[1:33:12] all the feelings out the visions out
[1:33:14] remember Abraham said that for two weeks
[1:33:16] he said let me pout when I said you owe
[1:33:19] me to understanding why this woman died
[1:33:21] in the hospital that was saved you know
[1:33:23] when she was should've drowned he got
[1:33:25] arrested you only understanding and the
[1:33:27] black sheep came down he said God let me
[1:33:29] cry it out for two weeks no one didn't
[1:33:31] feel God didn't feel nothing but yet he
[1:33:33] was sealed by the Holy Ghost the whole
[1:33:35] time
[1:33:36] Church you and I ought to be feel
[1:33:38] grateful when we can feel God's presence
[1:33:40] because brother Graham many numerous
[1:33:42] times in his life made mistakes like we
[1:33:44] all do and couldn't feel God's presence
[1:33:47] in other words come to church in you
[1:33:49] don't feel the anointing you don't feel
[1:33:51] the sacredness you don't feel the
[1:33:53] sweetness of the Holy Spirit we should
[1:33:56] live close to God obedient to God that
[1:34:00] we can always feel as presence there may
[1:34:03] be times we know in those times God is
[1:34:05] was testing us God was seeing well what
[1:34:09] are you gonna do when you're all alone
[1:34:10] and you're at a hotel and there's a TV
[1:34:12] there you're gonna turn it on and watch
[1:34:13] one of those movies oh it's a free movie
[1:34:15] we're gonna watch it what do you do
[1:34:21] you're all alone
[1:34:22] and here's this temptation what are you
[1:34:24] gonna do sometimes God will try us like
[1:34:26] that won't he
[1:34:29] how many want to pass the test by God's
[1:34:31] grace the Bible said the pride of his
[1:34:35] heart it was pride and he's an example
[1:34:40] of someone not dying prematurely but
[1:34:42] post maturely
[1:34:44] he lived longer than God wanted to live
[1:34:47] post maturely maokai won't you come here
[1:34:52] I'm gonna let's just have a word of
[1:34:53] Prayer and then after that I'll have you
[1:34:54] be seated again and I'll share a few
[1:34:56] things from that Jeffersonville movement
[1:35:00] let's just bow our heads here and I
[1:35:01] won't have the right spear of course
[1:35:02] when I say this and I'm gonna say Lord
[1:35:06] how do you raise your hand say lord help
[1:35:07] me to see my life as a race and a test
[1:35:10] and not a puzzle not as a minefield not
[1:35:16] as a carousel up and down not as a
[1:35:18] rollercoaster I'm just hanging on in
[1:35:20] this fast-paced world for dear life oh
[1:35:22] god help us tonight Lord my hands are up

[1:35:35] go see the family and I'm trying to go
[1:35:37] quick study real quick and pray and get
[1:35:40] all this done so I can do this and pay

[1:43:11] just just go over a few quotes just stay
[1:43:14] there America I just keep playing them
[1:43:15] this just let me just say like this I'm
[1:43:18] gonna do this just a little test we got
[1:43:19] a pass and what is the test to not
[1:43:24] criticize our brothers and sisters in
[1:43:26] Christ switch back over then I want to
[1:43:30] show a few quotes I told you on Sunday I
[1:43:35] wanted to share those again I like to do
[1:43:37] that tonight just real briefly and I
[1:43:41] have these videos I saved them if you
[1:43:43] want to watch him you know I shared him
[1:43:44] with Wendy I think I knew she wouldn't
[1:43:46] be our Wednesday night so I told her you
[1:43:47] know before she left some of the quotes
[1:43:49] and I shared some of the videos and and
[1:43:53] then after this we'll pray for the
[1:43:55] movement here
[1:43:56] I believe it's if I believe it's just a
[1:43:58] movement that gets got off track I
[1:44:00] believe they're sweet sincere say people
[1:44:02] I believe they're off track by taking
[1:44:05] preachers on the pulpit and then
[1:44:07] criticizing those who do have preachers
[1:44:10] in the pulpit so Bob Arum said when the
[1:44:13] seventh church age comes the he'll be a
[1:44:15] prophet you'll know he's a prophet
[1:44:17] because they'll be in that word exactly
[1:44:21] as God gave it to Paul so brother
[1:44:24] Branham was supposed to give us this
[1:44:26] right here and not change one thing that
[1:44:28] Paul said he said he won't deviate from
[1:44:32] that word for one moment not by one iota
[1:44:35] now here's what's been said it was a
[1:44:39] literal quote from a certain Brandon
[1:44:41] family member says God's Word which is
[1:44:43] the tapes and they say it's the tapes or
[1:44:47] nothing now what does this do Church
[1:44:50] this exalts the tape on equal level as
[1:44:53] the Bible and I believe that's wrong I
[1:44:57] believe the Bible is on its own level do
[1:45:01] the tapes contain many truths yes but
[1:45:04] the tapes are not the Bible the tapes
[1:45:06] points you to the Bible
[1:45:08] they say the tapes which is the worst so
[1:45:11] see what they've done they made a man
[1:45:14] infallible they made every word a man
[1:45:18] said they've said they made it thus
[1:45:20] saith the Lord that's wrong that's wrong
[1:45:24] and the second one this is word for word
[1:45:27] this is what a family member said the
[1:45:29] make believers so remember there's three
[1:45:31] kinds of believers and we are called
[1:45:34] make believers I can let you listen to
[1:45:36] it if you want make believer says man I
[1:45:39] don't know if playing the tapes is right
[1:45:41] or not it could be I don't know my
[1:45:42] pastor says if I play tapes in the
[1:45:44] church and we listen to them I'm a lazy
[1:45:45] pastor that's the make believer he says
[1:45:50] well the family says if you don't play
[1:45:54] tapes all the time
[1:45:55] you're I'm sorry when you play tapes all
[1:45:57] the time you're a believer you're a real
[1:45:58] believer if you struggle with should we
[1:46:01] play tapes or you live preachers you're
[1:46:04] a make believer see so all my preaching
[1:46:10] too something to this movement is make
[1:46:12] belief that Church let me say this I'm
[1:46:16] not a make believer I believe this word
[1:46:22] I've I wasn't raising the message I
[1:46:25] don't know nothing I didn't know about
[1:46:26] it I left everything to this message
[1:46:29] like I told the guy on the the YouTube
[1:46:31] the message believer or the the
[1:46:33] Jeffersonville guy I said the message is
[1:46:35] not the tapes brother Manson the message
[1:46:37] is the Bible vindicated word that God
[1:46:40] promised the message is the Bible I
[1:46:45] believe every word of the message
[1:46:48] because the message is the Bible brother
[1:46:49] Branham says now here's the test we're
[1:46:55] gonna get angry with it am i angry
[1:46:57] tonight I'm gonna pass this test
[1:47:00] I'm not gonna fail this test somebody
[1:47:03] calls me a make believer I'm not gonna
[1:47:04] let me tell you you're an unbeliever
[1:47:07] I'll do you one better no sir
[1:47:10] I'm gonna pass this test let me say like
[1:47:15] this God's gonna prove who's the
[1:47:18] believer and to make I'm gonna make
[1:47:19] believe let me say like that I'm not
[1:47:22] gonna Pat myself look at me I'm a
[1:47:25] believer and Jefferson movement
[1:47:27] Jeffersonville movement is a make
[1:47:29] believer I'm not saying that tonight I'm
[1:47:30] saying though I'm a believer I believe
[1:47:32] that with all my heart if I if I don't
[1:47:33] say that something's wrong with my faith
[1:47:35] well am i a make believer or not what am
[1:47:37] I see you have to say you're a believer
[1:47:40] they better understand what I'm saying
[1:47:43] you have to say you're a true believer
[1:47:46] but the test is are you gonna point the
[1:47:49] finger right back and say you're a make
[1:47:51] believer you're an unbeliever no sir no
[1:47:56] sir I see my life as a test I see my
[1:48:00] life as a race I'm not gonna pick up
[1:48:02] those those critical stones and try to
[1:48:04] run a little faster with these 20-pound
[1:48:06] stones a year they make my layer I'm not
[1:48:10] gonna run the race like that
[1:48:11] I'm gonna lay those weights aside I'm
[1:48:13] gonna run real smooth I'm just gonna be
[1:48:15] real patient and run the race without
[1:48:18] any weight of sin hindering my walk with
[1:48:21] God okay are you gonna email them back
[1:48:26] and text them back oh you better believe
[1:48:27] that
[1:48:29] with all the sweetness in my heart like
[1:48:33] today I was called because I made a
[1:48:35] comment about that made a comment and
[1:48:36] the it was the tape the tape boys from a
[1:48:40] certain country in Africa they call
[1:48:42] themselves the tape boys I can show it
[1:48:44] to you if you want afterwards the tape
[1:48:45] boys from a certain country in Africa
[1:48:47] they said well you wouldn't they said if
[1:48:50] you were a tape person you wouldn't even
[1:48:51] ask these questions and they said you're
[1:48:54] not even a real preacher
[1:48:56] and I left everything to preach the
[1:48:59] message I got two choices either I can
[1:49:02] fail the test I can pass the test I've
[1:49:06] ever written him back but I'm gonna
[1:49:07] write him back tomorrow in the morning
[1:49:08] after I pray I'm gonna pass the test I'm
[1:49:12] gonna say I'm not going to stoop to your
[1:49:14] level
[1:49:14] I might not even say that I'm gonna say
[1:49:19] well you're a child to your opinion but
[1:49:20] here's what brother Branham said show me
[1:49:26] what Paul said I'm the prof of the age I
[1:49:29] real sit down and preach no he said you
[1:49:31] preach the word he said preaches the
[1:49:34] faithful men that they can preach it
[1:49:35] also Amen rightly divide the word of
[1:49:39] truth don't sit down
[1:49:41] preach the word brother BAM said I'm not
[1:49:44] the only trouble on the beach he said we
[1:49:45] need more of them he said if God calls
[1:49:47] do you preach get out there and preach
[1:49:49] it we need more of them huh well the
[1:49:52] Branham says we need more preachers but
[1:49:54] the people say say what the tape say say
[1:49:56] what the tape say are not saying what
[1:49:57] the tapes say so that's fine you don't
[1:50:01] fine I'm not gonna call you make
[1:50:04] believer
[1:50:04] I'm gonna call you my brother and I'll
[1:50:08] let God sort it out
[1:50:10] because at the test church I got a pass
[1:50:15] to test how does that make you feel
[1:50:19] Lydia and a man says all your daddy's
[1:50:22] not a preacher how does that make you
[1:50:23] feel now guys that make you feel kind of
[1:50:31] putting them on the spot that thank you
[1:50:34] sir it would make me feel bad if
[1:50:37] somebody said something about you oh
[1:50:39] you're just a bunch of snakes in here
[1:50:42] let's basically kind of what they're
[1:50:43] saying you're make believers these
[1:50:46] aren't snakes these are God's lambs
[1:50:50] God's sweet little lambs and you know
[1:50:54] what the family member said the family
[1:50:56] member said their church is the lion's
[1:50:57] den now did you catch that
[1:50:59] what is the Lions that in the Bible the
[1:51:02] Lions then was Daniel the prophets test
[1:51:04] and the Lions were the enemies so God
[1:51:07] had to close the mouth of the Lions and
[1:51:10] this family member said their church his
[1:51:12] the Lions dead making it something like
[1:51:15] it's good the lion's den was not good
[1:51:19] God had to save them from the Lions then
[1:51:22] I thought how striking they admit
[1:51:25] they're the lion's den
[1:51:25] we're not the Lions then were the fold
[1:51:28] of the Sheep
[1:51:30] praise God and we say that with love
[1:51:36] it's just the test that the last one you
[1:51:39] know that's last one but just close with
[1:51:42] that let's pray for our friends in
[1:51:43] Jeffersonville they might not believe
[1:51:46] I'm a pastor or you know someone's not
[1:51:48] everybody horse but you know they might
[1:51:50] not believe I'm a believer but I believe
[1:51:55] God knows I'm a believer
[1:51:58] and that's really all that matters and
[1:52:00] God wants me to pass the test and I'm
[1:52:05] not the judge but Christ is the judge
[1:52:07] and Christ will all sorted out I'm gonna
[1:52:10] be one of those three that's for sure
[1:52:11] believer make-believe or unbeliever and
[1:52:15] I'm gonna run the race with patience
[1:52:16] that I can win the prize to have the
[1:52:22] fellowship with Christ and his
[1:52:24] sufferings Heavenly Father we love you
