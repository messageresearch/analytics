[0:23] by the grace of the lord
[0:26] joshua 17.
[0:30] just want to encourage you and your
[0:32] position in the lord praise god and i
[0:34] trust some things have been said the
[0:35] last few services that have been helped
[0:37] to you i know i've been really blessed
[0:39] and
[0:40] encouraged especially knowing that other
[0:41] people are listening to and being helped
[0:43] and
[0:43] feed on that that always encourages me
[0:45] as well but i've had a better week of
[0:46] prayer this week so i thank the lord for
[0:48] that
[0:49] and i think it was just you know hearing
[0:51] one thing what really helped me was
[0:52] hearing brother vang situation that just
[0:55] really moved me like wow it's starting
[0:56] to get a little serious for some of us
[0:57] you know so
[0:59] that really helped me and um let's just
[1:01] be uh really sensitive to the holy
[1:03] spirit praise god and
[1:04] uh we don't know all that's going to
[1:05] happen but one thing we do know that's
[1:07] going to happen is we're going to show
[1:08] the love of jesus christ
[1:10] to this world that's how they'll know
[1:12] they're my disciples that we love one
[1:14] another
[1:15] praise god and then we will love jesus
[1:17] christ with all of our hearts we'll love
[1:19] one another that's our main desire
[1:21] praise god to manifest the love of
[1:22] christ joshua chapter 17 let's just read
[1:27] let's start at verse 14. i'm gonna kind
[1:29] of build to 14 and try to just you know
[1:31] finish
[1:32] the chapter there
[1:34] towards the end
[1:35] of this hour-long sermon hopefully it'll
[1:38] be by god's grace joshua 17
[1:42] this is one of those beautiful thoughts
[1:44] that i hope the holy spirit can help me
[1:45] to
[1:46] relate to i remember i was telling you
[1:48] oh there's some beautiful thoughts later
[1:49] in the chat later in the book i thought
[1:51] it was one sunday you know last
[1:53] wednesday i hope this is another
[1:54] beautiful
[1:55] never seen it this
[1:57] in depth before and that proves to me
[1:59] that the holy ghost is revealing more
[2:01] truth because he's guiding us into all
[2:03] truth
[2:04] i never had these thoughts to this year
[2:06] so i just believe it's god giving us
[2:09] further revelation so i'm trusting that
[2:12] so let's read 14.
[2:14] i just want you to look at the attitude
[2:16] here uh
[2:18] we have a complaint from the children of
[2:20] this is five to seven years after
[2:22] they've already been in the land you
[2:24] know overcame jericho overcome ai the
[2:28] five kings
[2:29] uh
[2:30] judah already had the land ephraim had
[2:32] the land well manasseh
[2:35] has a little complaint they're
[2:36] complaining because of the battle
[2:39] and joshua has to encourage them
[2:41] and he has to speak the word to them
[2:43] praise god you'll see how it kind of
[2:44] goes here
[2:45] tonight so let let me read this just for
[2:47] the sake of time and then we'll read our
[2:49] memory verse for brother stephen
[2:50] together let me just read this myself
[2:52] here so the word of god says joshua 17
[2:54] 14 and the children of joseph spake unto
[2:56] joshua saying why hast thou given me but
[2:59] one lot and one portion to inherit
[3:00] seeing i am
[3:02] a great people for as much as
[3:05] the lord hath bless me hitherto
[3:07] so manasseh feels like i don't have
[3:09] enough
[3:09] you need to give me another portion
[3:12] verse 15 and joshua answered them if
[3:14] thou be a great people then get up or
[3:16] get the up to the wood country and cut
[3:18] down thyself there in the land of the
[3:19] parasites and the giants if mount eve
[3:22] from be too narrow for the look at verse
[3:24] 16.
[3:26] now we finally get to the bottom of this
[3:28] why they're complaining
[3:30] it's fear
[3:31] fear is causing them to complain at
[3:33] church the same thing happens with us
[3:35] but let's read verse or let me read 16
[3:37] and the children of joseph said the
[3:39] hill's not enough for us and all canines
[3:41] that dwell in the land of the valley
[3:42] have
[3:43] chariots of iron so now we see the real
[3:46] reason why they're saying more land they
[3:48] don't want to go to the land that was
[3:49] already given to them because they're
[3:51] afraid of the chariots of iron
[3:54] ever have that where god's calling you
[3:56] to something and you just
[3:58] a little afraid to take the possession
[4:00] a little afraid to possess or possess
[4:02] the promises of god that's how they'd
[4:04] gotten after five to seven years
[4:06] they kind of lost that initial
[4:09] confidence
[4:10] that they could defeat any foe
[4:17] and they are of the valley of jezreel
[4:21] okay if we do one let's go to remember
[4:23] verse philippians 2 verses 2 and 3.
[4:25] we'll read this one together
[4:30] philippians 2 verses 2 and 3.
[4:46] praise god let's read verses two and
[4:47] three together and just trust the lord
[4:49] to write this upon the fleshy tables of
[4:51] our hearts here
[4:52] ready on three one two three fulfill ye
[4:55] my joy that ye be like-minded having the
[4:59] same love being of one accord of one
[5:02] mind let nothing be done through strife
[5:05] or vain glory but in lowliness of mine
[5:09] let each esteem other better than
[5:12] themselves praise god let's have one
[5:13] more prayer if you ever need on your
[5:14] heart let's just make another god here
[5:16] heavenly father we don't come here in
[5:18] former fashion but we come by faith and
[5:20] lord through the holy spirit of truth oh
[5:22] god we thank you god we pray you meet
[5:24] every need lord you saw the hands that
[5:25] are up lord i just pray to speak to
[5:26] people hear present and also listening
[5:29] dear god in the name of jesus christ
[5:30] just anoint us for this service the
[5:32] purpose of this service lord god i've
[5:34] studied i've done what i can do lord i
[5:36] prayed i'm all like
[5:38] god just lord to go above and beyond my
[5:40] efforts because my efforts the lord are
[5:42] are just mine when i pray you do
[5:44] something supernatural or speak your
[5:45] word to your people lord give them the
[5:48] desire of their heart i pray in jesus
[5:50] christ's name and the saint said amen
[5:52] god bless you as you're being seated
[5:53] there uh we have slides here so you can
[5:55] hold them up here part 23 on joshua
[5:59] there's only 24 captors so
[6:02] we're coming down here
[6:04] close to the end i'm just checking to
[6:05] see if there's anything urgent here on
[6:07] the phone okay
[6:09] okay so part three i'm going to turn
[6:10] back to joshua so uh we're trying to do
[6:12] about 45 minutes and then uh hopefully
[6:14] we can finish around eight or so
[6:17] by god's grace
[6:21] so we're looking at here joshua again
[6:23] and and uh we're looking at chapter 17.
[6:25] we finished 16 there on sunday and begin
[6:28] looking at
[6:29] 17
[6:32] and again i want to say sunday what a
[6:33] what a wonderful job everybody did
[6:35] pulling on the word of god i think i
[6:37] preached two hours and it felt like an
[6:38] hour it even felt less than that so
[6:40] uh thank you for pulling on the word of
[6:42] god that's what makes being a pastor a
[6:43] real blessing
[6:44] the people love the word of god they can
[6:46] say amen they can clap they can smile
[6:49] they can enjoy the word of god so thank
[6:51] you for your your love for the word of
[6:53] god that's what separates us church from
[6:55] everybody else
[6:56] is our love for the word we have
[6:58] preeminence for the word of god
[7:00] more so than anyone else that ought to
[7:02] be what separates us praise god
[7:04] so joshua chapter 17.
[7:08] now we got there the uh the outline
[7:10] there's 17. here's the outline again i
[7:12] think i'll just review it real briefly
[7:13] here
[7:14] and then we'll start getting down to the
[7:16] major thoughts i'd like to
[7:17] minister on here tonight so verses one
[7:20] and two give the a lot of the half tribe
[7:22] of manasseh
[7:26] and and then verses three to six that's
[7:28] kind of what we ended on on sunday
[7:29] morning i should say sunday morning
[7:31] sunday first service because it wasn't
[7:32] morning it was afternoon
[7:34] uh the daughters of zahala fahad
[7:36] uh received their inheritance and we
[7:38] found our sisters
[7:40] can receive all the blessings of god
[7:42] amen all the rights for our sisters they
[7:45] can receive them same for our brothers
[7:47] praise god all of our brothers now i
[7:49] just thought about that just now but the
[7:51] ram said stephen wasn't a preacher but
[7:53] yet it looked like he preached in acts
[7:54] chapter 7.
[7:55] remember that right before he was stoned
[7:57] they bring him to the council and he
[7:59] sounds like a preacher he starts with
[8:01] abraham and he goes all down through
[8:03] comes up through david and solomon and
[8:05] he says you stiff-necked men
[8:08] how often you rest or how often you
[8:10] resist the holy ghost and then they
[8:11] stone him it's a whole chapter of
[8:13] basically church history right and there
[8:16] he is he's not a preacher but he's
[8:18] expounding all the word of god and he's
[8:20] discerning their spirits right
[8:22] he's discerning judging that they're
[8:23] resisting the holy spirit in other words
[8:25] they're keeping the holy spirit instead
[8:27] of accepting the holy spirit praise god
[8:30] so there you have like this this liberty
[8:32] of god right the liberty of god to let
[8:34] sisters speak the word of god at times
[8:36] in certain ways just not behind the
[8:38] pulpit and brothers they might not be
[8:39] called behind the pulpit but they can
[8:41] truly speak the word of god
[8:43] amen many again many of god's blessings
[8:46] are going to come through speaking the
[8:48] word of god hallelujah by opening your
[8:50] mouth and letting the re the living
[8:53] rivers of water flow from your mouth
[8:56] that's what jesus said when you get the
[8:58] holy ghost that water will flow freely
[9:00] praise god now of course not every day
[9:02] of your life you know but when you get
[9:04] under the anointing you confess your
[9:05] sins and you get under prayer and under
[9:07] the anointing that it's very likely the
[9:09] waters of life are ready to flow from
[9:11] the lips of your mouth praise god
[9:14] amen so that's what happened to stephen
[9:16] at a young age i believe in philanthropy
[9:17] he was 25 when they uh when they
[9:20] martyred him if i'm not mistaken i wrote
[9:22] it in the book i did the history in the
[9:23] book it's in the book i just showed how
[9:25] stephen had one or two years of mystery
[9:28] and yet jesus stood up to honor him when
[9:30] he came into his his kingdom praise god
[9:33] and whereas john had over 70 years of
[9:36] ministry
[9:37] what the what didn't jesus say both get
[9:40] the same reward praise god
[9:42] amen
[9:43] hallelujah
[9:44] so it doesn't matter how long
[9:46] it don't matter how long we got to serve
[9:48] god we got to serve god all the days of
[9:50] our life and we'll expect the same
[9:52] reward praise god because we're all
[9:54] laboring in the vineyard whether it's in
[9:56] the heatness or the heat rather than
[9:58] bait or the end of the day no matter how
[10:01] long we labor whether it's one hour or
[10:03] whether it's eight hours or 12 hours no
[10:05] matter how long we labor jesus gives the
[10:07] same reward praise god i want to be
[10:10] thankful for that praise god forget the
[10:11] reward of eternal life amen
[10:14] thank god now
[10:17] struck i never really thought about
[10:18] steven until just now in that way with
[10:20] uh this this thought here
[10:23] uh with brothers being able to speak the
[10:24] word of god as well and there may not be
[10:26] preachers because it don't matter uh you
[10:28] can still speak for god at any time amen
[10:31] now
[10:33] the borders here of manasseh are
[10:35] described in verses 7 to 13 and you stop
[10:39] you see rivers you see seas uh you see
[10:43] uh different towns they go through it's
[10:45] a unique
[10:47] boundary here of the half tribe of nasa
[10:50] very unique boundary okay just as we saw
[10:53] all the other boundaries none of them
[10:55] were the same they were all unique and
[10:57] they all required uh different
[10:59] boundaries
[11:00] now um
[11:02] i'm sorry that was just one of my notes
[11:03] never got to that thought but let me
[11:05] just go to this thought okay just i'm
[11:06] just going to review this remember paul
[11:08] said he had finished his court
[11:10] at the end of his life so he had he had
[11:12] walked in all the land god had called
[11:15] him to amen
[11:17] and that was only two years after saying
[11:19] he not yet attained
[11:23] so see god makes all things beautiful in
[11:25] his time in season
[11:28] now we know last week we went through
[11:29] all his ministries he no doubt had all
[11:32] five preaching gifts no doubt about it
[11:34] as far as i'm concerned from the bible
[11:36] and the quotes in history it seems to me
[11:39] no doubt about it
[11:41] um now his vocations he was a faithful
[11:44] tent maker
[11:45] and in his day god called him not to
[11:48] take anything from that specific church
[11:50] he was at now remember he did take
[11:51] things from other churches right
[11:54] but there were some times in the month
[11:55] of corinthians he didn't take anything
[11:58] he was just a master temp maker
[12:00] he was able to make a tent by the way
[12:01] and that you'd sleep it would handle all
[12:03] the weather you sleep in it and you feel
[12:05] like this is going to last forever he
[12:06] was he was such a good tent maker he
[12:08] must because he was faithful just as he
[12:10] was faithful with the word he was
[12:12] faithful with his job and may god help
[12:14] us to do the same amen
[12:16] be faithful with the word be faithful
[12:18] with our occupations as well be the best
[12:20] worker you can be praise god i got my
[12:22] next uh
[12:25] i got my next uh what do they call it
[12:26] like a grading for me coming up last
[12:28] time i got the highest score i'm hoping
[12:29] to get the highest score this year but
[12:30] it's coming up in a couple weeks here
[12:33] so i'm gonna strive to get the highest
[12:34] grade i can on this one to be the best
[12:36] teacher i can be uh but that's how paul
[12:39] was he was a expert tap maker
[12:42] in common with aquila right
[12:45] now his vo his locations was led by the
[12:47] holy spirit remember he tried to go to
[12:49] asia one time and the holy spirit said
[12:51] not now
[12:52] he said go down to macedonia remember
[12:54] that he got the macedonian mission
[12:56] remember there was one time he had to
[12:58] leave i forget which church he was we
[12:59] had a little church so he could go to
[13:01] jerusalem and be there by the by the
[13:04] festival time because he had a vow to
[13:05] keep
[13:07] you see he was led by the holy spirit on
[13:09] his locations as well
[13:11] he was one that didn't stay in one place
[13:13] very long but then you have other people
[13:15] that stayed in certain places for their
[13:17] whole life
[13:18] they got gotta just call them to be
[13:20] there other people called to travel now
[13:22] don't get jealous if you like to travel
[13:24] but you know god's not called you to
[13:25] travel
[13:27] don't get jealous
[13:29] right and if you if god's called you to
[13:31] travel don't complain about traveling
[13:33] and it's hard to travel in copenhagen
[13:34] but
[13:35] uh it's starting to open up a little bit
[13:37] in fact i saw an article today it's so
[13:38] it's so funny they said oh uh they all
[13:41] the airlines expect to be open by 2024
[13:43] huh that's when the next presidential
[13:44] election is going to be
[13:45] makes sense doesn't it get they're going
[13:47] to try to cheat again and get their own
[13:48] candidate in again just like they did
[13:50] last time
[13:51] interesting that they say that but see
[13:53] church we can't complain what god has
[13:55] called us to be sometimes i wish i
[13:57] traveled more but i've learned to be
[13:59] content
[14:00] right it will whatever state god's
[14:01] called me to be in may god help me be
[14:04] content praise god and same with you and
[14:06] i
[14:07] whatever god's called us to be in each
[14:08] area of our life we should show
[14:10] contentment by the holy spirit
[14:12] not complain not and others right we
[14:15] just read be kind to others praise god
[14:18] right have one mind
[14:20] don't be jealous of other preachers
[14:21] don't be muslim other brothers other
[14:23] sisters be thankful for what you have
[14:25] because godliness with contentment is a
[14:28] great spiritual attainment amen
[14:30] that's a great mountain you can possess
[14:32] amen being content with what you have
[14:35] praise god and living a holy life that's
[14:37] a great achievement that's a great giant
[14:39] to slaughter amen
[14:41] hallelujah thank god
[14:44] now just so you know i'm going to say
[14:46] this i'll mention again all these are in
[14:48] my book in chapter 11.
[14:51] i tried to simmer it down or what's it
[14:53] called not silver evaporated down what's
[14:55] in another word distill it down i tried
[14:57] this what was it
[14:58] condensed that's the word thank you
[15:01] that's a hundred dollar word right there
[15:03] if you want to get that going to kent
[15:05] state university right there
[15:07] you try to condense it down and i found
[15:09] i could be wrong five is the number of
[15:11] grace but i could be wrong brother i
[15:12] thought there was five errors that we
[15:14] have everyone has to be responsible for
[15:15] in life and i could be wrong i'm just
[15:17] saying
[15:18] i try to condense it down to
[15:20] uh the areas so the next one was gifts
[15:22] of the spirit now paul said i speak with
[15:25] tongues more than you all
[15:26] well no doubt this guy would encourage
[15:28] church if anybody needed encouragement
[15:30] it would fall
[15:32] we went through his list right of
[15:33] beatings and trials and sufferings and
[15:36] if anybody needed to speak with tongues
[15:38] it would fall
[15:39] right
[15:40] and you need it just ask god for i
[15:42] talked to numerous people they just
[15:43] needed god to encourage them to speak in
[15:45] tongues and god let them now i ask and i
[15:47] don't get to so
[15:48] you keep asking i'm asking too
[15:51] amen just keep asking but if anybody
[15:54] needed a just strength to keep going it
[15:57] would have been paul so god let him
[15:59] speak with tongues god let him prophesy
[16:02] uh god let him do discern spirits right
[16:04] he descended the spirit of that man that
[16:05] was trying to get uh that he called the
[16:07] son of the devil that he called blind
[16:09] elimus elimus
[16:11] he discerned that spirit so i believe if
[16:14] i studied it out i could probably find
[16:15] that he had at least eight of the nine
[16:17] gifts of the holy spirit i don't know
[16:19] that we have a scripture where he
[16:20] interpreted tongues
[16:21] but i wouldn't put it past him
[16:23] would you
[16:25] i wouldn't if he had all the preaching
[16:26] gifts and if if martin luther had all
[16:29] nine spiritual gifts
[16:30] what about paul
[16:32] so i believe we could probably prove it
[16:34] if we just took the time the thought
[16:35] just came to me so i didn't really study
[16:37] it out yet but i believe we can find
[16:39] that don't you no doubt if anybody had
[16:41] wisdom it was paul
[16:43] right here if anybody had a word of
[16:44] knowledge to point him to the word of
[16:46] god it would have been paul right
[16:47] miracles right here we go here we go
[16:49] americans uh divine healing praise god
[16:52] uh
[16:52] all these gifts of the holy spirit
[16:55] i believe we'd find them in this man of
[16:57] god except maybe interpretation
[17:00] and then relationships this is an area
[17:02] where he had a special gift he didn't
[17:05] really desire wife right
[17:07] and paul said to each man his own gift
[17:10] right
[17:11] and so
[17:12] that's what we're given here in the
[17:14] scripture uh it seems to me there's
[17:16] around five maybe less maybe more uh
[17:18] areas church that you and i must attain
[17:21] to
[17:22] at the end of our lives we want to say i
[17:25] walked in the course that god had me to
[17:27] walk
[17:29] right
[17:32] now he was faithful in all these
[17:34] preaching gifts as we said along with
[17:36] every other heir of his life now how
[17:38] many like art
[17:40] everyone like nature likes did you have
[17:42] art today
[17:44] in at school yeah all right good we had
[17:46] music
[17:47] uh
[17:49] how many like art though oh i just had
[17:51] this idea after i preached sunday mo uh
[17:53] the first service
[17:54] remember i put all these in chapter five
[17:56] so if you want to go read that list i
[17:58] don't have the audio ready yet but if
[17:59] you want to read that you can read it
[18:00] now i already preached it you know a
[18:02] year ago maybe but i just thought
[18:04] wouldn't it be interesting just to give
[18:05] us a little visual this is brazil right
[18:07] but let's just have just have a
[18:10] let's just pretend that we're christians
[18:11] right
[18:13] and we're trying to take the land
[18:16] there is a time and season let's pretend
[18:18] this is your land
[18:20] okay there we go mercy
[18:23] i just want to just want to give you a
[18:24] visual so i thought i'd be an artist
[18:26] tonight actually i drew that tonight at
[18:28] or today at school i was at school i had
[18:29] my break
[18:30] just pretend you are joshua and you are
[18:34] possessing your land
[18:36] you've got to go in the land and it
[18:37] doesn't really matter the order that
[18:39] these are in
[18:41] but there's something about you church
[18:43] that you want thus saith the lord for
[18:45] your relationships
[18:47] you just don't want any relationship you
[18:49] want to be thus saith the lord that god
[18:52] put these relationships together or lack
[18:54] thereof like paul
[18:56] right
[18:57] and church is something you have to
[18:59] battle for i don't know you have to
[19:00] battle sometimes in relationships
[19:02] to keep peace
[19:03] right to show forgiveness in your
[19:05] relationships
[19:07] and you've got to possess that land it's
[19:10] something you've got to conquer i can't
[19:12] do it for you you can't do it for me god
[19:15] has called you to possess that land
[19:17] that's right
[19:18] right and then when you possess that
[19:20] then you want to possess
[19:22] ministries that god has given to you
[19:24] and that can be almsgiving that can be
[19:27] giving of clothes like tabitha right she
[19:29] had a clothes mystery
[19:31] a music ministry
[19:33] right a song special ministry
[19:37] all these different ministries god has
[19:38] given to you a witnessing ministry
[19:41] robertson orphanage ministry is he said
[19:43] that's of the lord
[19:46] and you've got to possess that it may be
[19:48] a great amount of possession and maybe a
[19:52] lot of battles but church if you want if
[19:54] you want to be a real holy ghost field
[19:56] state you don't have a choice you've got
[19:57] to possess the land amen
[20:01] that's why church you won't be satisfied
[20:04] until you possess all these things cause
[20:06] that's what paul said
[20:07] paul says i'm not alive but i'm pressing
[20:10] towards the next goal i'm pressing
[20:12] toward the next land that i can possess
[20:16] i'm forgetting the losses in the past
[20:18] right i'm forgetting those things which
[20:19] are behind me but there's something
[20:21] about a christian you won't feel settled
[20:23] brother william you won't feel settled
[20:25] until every era you know you finish your
[20:27] course amen
[20:29] he's driven out every enemy he's driven
[20:31] out every giant praise god that's why
[20:34] you keep coming back to church right
[20:35] that's why you keep reading your bible
[20:37] praying studying the word of god listen
[20:39] to brother branham where you listen to
[20:40] some of my sermons or some of the
[20:42] visitors we've had here you can't feel
[20:44] settled you can't feel at peace until
[20:46] you possess all the promises of god amen
[20:51] and then church you got to press in you
[20:52] got to find the right vocation
[20:55] a lot of brothers struggle with that
[20:56] somebody somebody emailed me from i
[20:58] forget which state it was this week he's
[21:00] like i'm having such trouble with my job
[21:03] and he was worried about you know should
[21:05] he go back to school and get a biology
[21:06] degree with that contract the word of
[21:08] god i said no i said i know saints have
[21:10] got degrees i've got two degrees
[21:12] i could get it i could've got a lot more
[21:14] if i wanted to i could because it's
[21:16] school work right it's just learning it
[21:17] says there's nothing really hard about
[21:18] getting a degree
[21:20] but he was trying to say is god in that
[21:21] well yes god is in that because god
[21:23] needs an overcomer in the universities
[21:26] right god's got to have somebody that i
[21:28] stood there i heard all their lies i
[21:30] cast that down and i still passed the
[21:32] course and i told the professor about it
[21:34] or he read my he read my paper about it
[21:37] right and i took a stand for it and i
[21:39] really expressed christ to those people
[21:41] amen
[21:42] while the other people were cussing in
[21:43] the class or smoking after class or
[21:46] something like that i was reading my
[21:47] bible i was i was i was living a holy
[21:49] life and things like that god needs a
[21:51] witness in every area praise god
[21:54] so i told that man i said don't feel bad
[21:56] about that in fact when i told you this
[21:58] maybe when i came in the message a lot
[21:59] of my friends left because i heard
[22:01] brother brahm say education's wrong well
[22:03] i mean it is
[22:04] but i didn't feel allowed to do that
[22:06] right and so i stayed in education and
[22:09] now church a lot of my friends and
[22:10] family look at me and say well well you
[22:12] got one of the best jobs because you
[22:14] have all this time with your family in
[22:15] the church so i said thank you lord
[22:17] i'm glad i felt letting us in right and
[22:20] i see some of my family and friends they
[22:21] work endless hours they don't get any
[22:23] family time they don't get any vacations
[22:25] i get vacations all the time
[22:28] right
[22:28] but that's a lot that's why i just felt
[22:30] led of the lord to do that praise god
[22:33] and god has vindicated i told the one
[22:35] brother on the email i said i had so
[22:37] many families tell me that i was the
[22:38] answer to their prayers they wanted
[22:40] their children to have a good teacher in
[22:42] the beginning and it was a christian
[22:44] teacher
[22:45] and god used me to answer their prayer
[22:47] so this is just a humble thing just a
[22:50] just trying to find god's will for your
[22:52] life
[22:54] and then the gifts of the holy spirit
[22:55] that's one that we all can grow closer
[22:57] and right we all want to know god help
[22:59] me to help me to know my gifts and then
[23:00] help me to be faithful with them as well
[23:03] and that's where you know we really need
[23:04] to the bible said
[23:06] follow charity right but then covet
[23:08] gifts
[23:09] so that's one thing i i need i need the
[23:11] holy spirit to keep reminding me that's
[23:12] something we should pray for so every
[23:14] now and then we should just pray for
[23:16] that god we want to see gifts in church
[23:18] right a few months ago we prayed for our
[23:20] little daughters they would be prophets
[23:22] right here we pray that that uh he'll
[23:24] god pour out his spirit upon all flesh
[23:26] right i think i know i remember naomi
[23:28] was here i know my children were here
[23:29] when we prayed that prayer for the
[23:31] daughters like philip's daughters right
[23:33] we want daughters that prophesy praise
[23:35] god we want sons that prophesy
[23:37] hallelujah we want them to feel the
[23:39] premise of god as well
[23:41] amen
[23:42] let's see that's one that's one we can
[23:43] press into
[23:46] and can i say it like this with location
[23:49] one reason paul never felt like he
[23:51] arrived because he had to get to a place
[23:54] he had to get to rome
[23:57] because the holy spirit had been telling
[23:59] him you've got to go to rome you got to
[24:00] go to rome right
[24:02] every city where i don't it's witness
[24:04] that you must go up the road
[24:06] so that was one that's interesting i put
[24:08] in that last place because i must have
[24:10] been led by the lord there but paul's
[24:12] last
[24:13] ground that he possessed was going to
[24:15] rome and testifying to the leaders
[24:17] enrolled that jesus christ is alive and
[24:20] resurrected amen i wonder what his last
[24:22] words were before he was beheaded
[24:26] right there in rome right there in front
[24:27] of all those men remember
[24:29] remember the book of philippians he
[24:31] witnessed to every guard that was there
[24:33] in the jail
[24:35] so i imagine he was witnessing the whole
[24:36] time before his head got chopped off too
[24:39] just witnessing just manifesting and
[24:41] that was the very last and he could feel
[24:43] it he could feel when he wrote that last
[24:44] letter to timothy i finished my course
[24:47] i've done exactly what god's called me
[24:48] to do i possess the locations i possess
[24:51] the gifts in my life the vocations my
[24:53] ministry my relationships i've stayed
[24:55] pure i've done all these things i'm
[24:58] ready to be offered and i'm ready for
[24:59] the crowd amen
[25:01] hallelujah
[25:02] he's an overcomer church praise god
[25:06] how many want to be overcomers
[25:08] so i hope i hope next time church you
[25:09] think about your life you'll picture
[25:11] something like this because this is what
[25:12] came to my mind brother am i like i need
[25:14] to draw that in there that's that's me
[25:16] i'm possessing the land i possess these
[25:19] possess these i really feel like uh yeah
[25:21] maybe there may be more vocations or
[25:23] gifts or even ministries like one day i
[25:24] want to be a missionary if the lord be
[25:25] willing so i feel like there's more area
[25:27] for me to possess praise god
[25:30] i'm not attained i'm forgetting the
[25:32] things in the past i'm saying god
[25:34] forgive me my favorite in the past i'm
[25:36] going to go forward with you in the name
[25:37] of the lord jesus
[25:39] amen
[25:41] so let's possess our land church
[25:46] now here's one thing that's different
[25:48] from you and i we will attain the
[25:50] perfect will of god church now don't the
[25:52] foolish virgins have all these two don't
[25:53] they have them oh
[25:55] but do they really possess god's perfect
[25:57] will for their lives now think about lot
[25:59] and abraham did lot really possess he
[26:02] was foolish virgin did he really possess
[26:04] the perfect will of god for his life no
[26:07] because he lost his wife right
[26:09] he lost family members to sodom
[26:12] he lived a life daily vexed can you
[26:14] imagine being tormented every day
[26:17] who wants to live in torment the bible
[26:19] says the word devil means torment praise
[26:21] god
[26:22] who wants to live in torments that
[26:24] proves he never defeated some of those
[26:26] giants in his life
[26:28] right he let those giants live in his
[26:30] home the angels didn't want to go into
[26:32] his house brother
[26:34] he said we'd rather sleep on the streets
[26:36] i've never wanted to sleep in the street
[26:38] okay i stepped outside twice when i was
[26:40] in college
[26:41] on the florida beaches that was enough
[26:42] for me
[26:43] i don't want to go out to the streets
[26:45] but these angels said i'd rather sleep
[26:47] on the streets than walk in that man's
[26:49] house what was in that man's house well
[26:51] we know his women daughters
[26:53] that eventually wanted to sleep with him
[26:56] right there must have been something
[26:57] there must that was the end result but
[26:59] there must have been something laying in
[27:00] their spirits that would want to do that
[27:02] you understand
[27:03] that that that the incest the manifest
[27:07] had to start somewhere inside of their
[27:09] hearts or spirits
[27:12] no one angels didn't want to go in there
[27:15] right
[27:16] so see
[27:17] lot never possessed these things he
[27:20] never got to the perfect will of god
[27:21] like abraham where god convinced abraham
[27:24] amen
[27:25] and come right to his tent door
[27:27] hallelujah and visit him and say this
[27:29] time next year i'll visit you and sarah
[27:32] according to the time of life amen
[27:34] and you're going to possess the promise
[27:36] that i'm the land i promise to you for
[27:39] 25 years you're going to possess it in
[27:41] the right time in seas today man
[27:44] glory praise god he's going to possess
[27:46] that relationship of being a father
[27:48] to isaac's son amen
[27:51] he's got she's got to change some
[27:52] locations
[27:53] right because remember went up to uh the
[27:55] other king abimelech he had had to go to
[27:57] some locations he had to change
[27:58] sometimes but see he was in the perfect
[28:00] will of god that's one thing we should
[28:03] have that denominations won't we should
[28:05] have the perfect will of god because we
[28:07] know how to present our bodies a living
[28:09] sacrifice unto god and we know how to
[28:12] have our minds transformed amen
[28:15] if not you need to pull more on the word
[28:17] of god that's how you get your mind
[28:18] transformed
[28:19] you're going to go listen to brother
[28:21] dixon's friday night sermon again
[28:23] praise god
[28:25] under the influence
[28:26] i know you're right that's what i need
[28:28] to at times right we all need that
[28:30] we have to transform our mind out of
[28:33] carnal thinking into holy ghost thinking
[28:37] and then we possess these things
[28:39] remember let's go to ephesians 4 here
[28:41] this is one difference between the wise
[28:43] and foolish virgin the y spends her time
[28:46] redeeming it i just want to rehearse
[28:48] this i know it's
[28:50] i know it's something i've preached in
[28:51] the past can preach it a couple of times
[28:53] ago he was here we preached on the wise
[28:55] and foolish
[28:57] i just want to reiterate to you your use
[28:59] of time
[29:01] is what's most important
[29:05] because you will spend time in the areas
[29:08] god has called you into
[29:10] and then you will overcome in those
[29:12] areas how many can say amen to that
[29:15] see the foolish virgin will never
[29:16] possess the land
[29:18] in fact lot moved away from abraham
[29:20] right he left he forgot about the
[29:22] promised son he left that
[29:25] and he didn't spend his time on the
[29:26] right things if he would he would have
[29:28] lived in peace like abraham
[29:34] does god want us to live continue the
[29:36] life of torment i don't believe so
[29:38] i don't believe son
[29:40] we're supposed to stir up our pure minds
[29:42] by way of remembrance right walking in
[29:44] love imitating the father
[29:46] all right ephesians 4.
[29:55] well you know what i'm sorry might not
[29:56] be four might be five yeah i'm sorry
[29:58] after five
[30:00] five
[30:02] five verse fourteen where for he saith
[30:04] awake thou that sleepless and arise from
[30:06] the dead in christ shall give thee light
[30:08] see then that ye walk circumspectly that
[30:10] means exactly not as fools but as wise
[30:13] redeeming the time because the days are
[30:15] evil wherefore be not unwise but
[30:18] understanding what the will the lord is
[30:21] so wise virgins will understand god's
[30:23] will proved it with god by spending time
[30:25] with god by being renewed in prayer with
[30:28] god having a renewed life by hearing the
[30:30] word wise virgins will know exactly what
[30:33] they did and they'll know they did it
[30:34] right before the lord
[30:37] but foolish versions will have questions
[30:40] i didn't really possess that
[30:42] why did this happen in my life why did i
[30:44] lose that why why how come i was
[30:45] tormented all these times
[30:47] because they didn't follow the revealed
[30:49] word of god their day
[30:51] all right does that make sense everybody
[30:53] understand
[30:54] okay
[30:57] now verse 18 kind of tells us why be
[31:00] and be not drunk with mine wearing his
[31:02] ex but be filled with the spirit see
[31:03] they didn't walk according to the
[31:05] feeling of the holy spirit they didn't
[31:07] stay filled with the holy spirit in
[31:08] their mind they never had in their soul
[31:10] right
[31:11] but they didn't
[31:13] keep it in their minds either
[31:15] okay foolish virgin now that's what
[31:17] foolish version would be would do they
[31:19] would not redeem their time and i've
[31:21] seen it like i told you i tell you all
[31:22] about all my friends that are not in the
[31:24] message and the same thing is true they
[31:26] spend all this time watching movies like
[31:27] we talk with tucker or the football game
[31:29] like we talked about on sunday with that
[31:30] preacher they spend that would be six
[31:33] hours if they watch the browns game and
[31:35] the buckeyes game six hours of wasted
[31:38] time they could have been in prayer they
[31:39] could have been in the bible they could
[31:41] have been in a bible study or something
[31:42] like that but where were we
[31:44] in the house of god amen redeeming the
[31:47] time because we know the days are evil
[31:49] we know the beast system is on the move
[31:51] but that means if they're on the move
[31:53] we're on the move too amen
[31:55] hallelujah jesus is going to rescue us
[31:57] from the beast system hallelujah amen
[32:01] hallelujah we're not ordained unto wrath
[32:04] but we're ordained to salvation paul
[32:06] said
[32:09] that's what i put in that texas
[32:10] foreigner so i'd like to share with you
[32:12] about the beast and the roman catholic
[32:13] church
[32:14] and the united states government and
[32:15] their role together that's what i said
[32:17] in the text but i haven't heard back
[32:19] so see that's one thing that separates
[32:21] us church we know the perfect will of
[32:23] god
[32:25] so that means church you know it was
[32:26] god's will where are you located
[32:29] it was god's will
[32:30] to give you those gifts and you were
[32:32] faithful those gifts
[32:34] it was god's will that you had this job
[32:35] or that job or stayed at home that's a
[32:37] real job
[32:38] you know it was god's will to do the
[32:40] ministries god called you to do
[32:43] you know it was god's will to be in the
[32:45] relationships that you were in because
[32:47] they didn't go against the word of god
[32:49] amen
[32:50] and the church said
[32:52] but see foolish virgins have all
[32:53] questions they haven't possessed these
[32:55] they haven't possessed the perfect will
[32:57] of god yes they get married yes they
[32:58] have ministries yeah they go to church
[33:00] and exercise gifts but they haven't
[33:02] possessed the perfect will of god for
[33:04] all those
[33:06] does that make sense
[33:08] they have all these things
[33:10] but they don't do god's perfect will for
[33:12] them
[33:14] right
[33:16] all right i hope that's simple there by
[33:18] god's grace now let me lay this in here
[33:20] go to uh romans 8 15.
[33:26] we'll just read these down malachi lydia
[33:27] can you get your bibles ready
[33:29] uh malachi romans 8 23 lydia galatians 4
[33:33] 7.
[33:35] brother jose can you get first john 3 2
[33:37] do you like reading brother jose
[33:38] first john 3 2. can you get that one
[33:41] i just want to lay this in here without
[33:42] having to preach a whole sermon on it
[33:44] church i believe if you are born again
[33:46] you are in the process of being adopted
[33:50] the full adoption doesn't take place to
[33:52] get the new body
[33:54] that's what the bible says
[33:57] and if you're adopted then that means
[34:00] you have the rights of the father
[34:03] the you have the inheritance of the
[34:05] father praise god
[34:07] right that's what it means
[34:09] doesn't mean you're a beggar a child is
[34:11] not a beggar right
[34:12] a child is a heir praise god a child is
[34:16] a possessor
[34:17] praise the
[34:18] lord lydia doesn't have to sign papers
[34:21] to drive the car here when she's you
[34:23] know you have to make a deal with me and
[34:24] give me money to drive the car she's my
[34:26] daughter
[34:28] now if you take my car i might say am i
[34:29] no i'm just kidding
[34:32] my neighbors caught him i have to pay me
[34:35] some money to borrow my car
[34:38] maokai and lydia don't have to ask me to
[34:40] go in the fridge
[34:42] they know they can go in the fridge now
[34:44] don't touch my stuff though
[34:46] but you understand their family praise
[34:48] god and so are we that's why brother
[34:50] abraham says our name on the check is
[34:52] good just as good as god's amen when we
[34:54] ask according to his will
[34:58] right we shouldn't ask for a mercedes
[35:00] right i don't think we should ask for
[35:01] that we shouldn't ask for
[35:04] you know mansions and things like that
[35:06] why would we want to mention here we
[35:07] want the mansion over there praise god
[35:09] we don't want to get this confused i
[35:10] don't want my mansion here i want my
[35:12] mansion over there
[35:13] praise god
[35:14] you know we have a place to live and if
[35:16] god gives you something that's different
[35:17] we talk about that
[35:20] but we want to set our sights on things
[35:22] above praise god
[35:24] set your affections on things of love
[35:26] but yet we have authority as children of
[35:28] god yeah i'm reading romans 8 15 and
[35:32] then malachi you do romans 8
[35:34] 23
[35:36] now for we have not received a spirit of
[35:38] bondage again to fear so we don't live
[35:39] in fear like slaves but ye have received
[35:42] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry
[35:45] abba father so if you're born again
[35:47] you've already got this spirit of
[35:49] adoption amen and you cry out to god you
[35:52] know god's your father amen so you're
[35:54] growing in that relationship right with
[35:57] how to act around your father how to how
[35:59] to have confidence in your father how to
[36:01] treat your father your girl he's not a
[36:03] stranger he's your father amen amen
[36:06] i'm the children's father i'm around
[36:08] them all the time they know how to
[36:09] approach me when they need something
[36:10] when they want something well i'd say
[36:12] victoria really knows how to cuddle up
[36:13] to with me in the morning and ask me for
[36:15] honey toast she knows how to do that
[36:16] real good
[36:17] she knows how to butter daddy up you
[36:19] know
[36:20] she'll probably ask me tomorrow morning
[36:22] if i got it if i got it i'll do it
[36:25] but see if you've got the spirit of god
[36:27] you're already adopted now the doctrine
[36:29] is not finished but you've got the
[36:31] spirit of it and that's what's most
[36:32] important amen
[36:34] right like brother said by the spirit of
[36:36] uh michelangelo i do art
[36:40] but by the spirit of jesus christ i live
[36:42] like christ amen because i got the
[36:44] spirit of it amen
[36:46] hallelujah now romans 8 23 this says
[36:50] the fullness of adoption comes when we
[36:52] get the glorified
[37:07] all right nice job malcolm
[37:09] see we
[37:10] earlier it says we have the spirit but
[37:12] then it says when we get a new body
[37:14] that's when we are fully adopted all
[37:17] right galatians 4 7 please lydia
[37:19] galatians 4 7. now this whole chapter
[37:22] verses 1 to 7 is about adoption it
[37:25] doesn't say the word adoption but it
[37:27] talks about leaving the law as a slave
[37:29] and coming into grace and now you're
[37:31] adopted by the baptism of the holy ghost
[37:32] so can you read
[37:34] actually literally 6 and roof 697
[37:48] amen praise god let's say this let's say
[37:50] i'm an heir of god ready i'm an heir of
[37:52] god and if you need something ask the
[37:54] lord from it but be willing to be be
[37:57] happy even if he says no
[37:59] right or would be happy even if he says
[38:01] wait on it brother jess
[38:04] praise god
[38:05] you should be happy make your request
[38:08] because you are sons that's why he gave
[38:10] you the holy ghost you were
[38:11] predestinated to be sons because he
[38:14] foresaw you choose him so he gives you
[38:16] the holy ghost because you are sons and
[38:18] that's what the bible tells us amen
[38:20] you're not a servant you're not a slave
[38:22] you're a heir of god you're a possessor
[38:25] of god's blessings amen
[38:29] and then first john 3 2 brother joseph
[38:33] now are we the son of god and he does
[38:36] not just appear
[38:39] but we know that when he shall appear
[38:46] hey man great job jose i feel like
[38:47] giving him claps i'll give him two claps
[38:50] it's been a while since we've done that
[38:51] for him
[38:53] john said we are beloved we are now
[38:56] everybody say now
[38:57] now we are now the sons of god amen
[39:01] but we'll be totally adopted when we see
[39:03] jesus face to face but now we are the
[39:06] sons of god and now we can ask the
[39:08] father for what we have in need of and
[39:09] we can also be happy if he says no or
[39:12] wait or yes i'll do it right now we can
[39:14] be happy because we have a relationship
[39:16] with god we trust him we love him and we
[39:19] know he loves us
[39:21] amen we're not slaves under the law
[39:24] we're not trying to earn salvation we're
[39:26] already saved we got the spirit of god
[39:28] amen we are his children praise god we
[39:30] are possessing the land in other words
[39:32] if we're born again we're already in the
[39:34] land praise god
[39:36] and if there's a battle there's
[39:37] something we must face we must go up
[39:39] against it remember we won't drive out
[39:41] every day tonight praise god there will
[39:44] be some left on there some troubles we
[39:45] still have but the majority of them we
[39:48] should drive out by the grace of god
[39:50] because that's what joshua did he had a
[39:51] few failures he had a few mistakes but
[39:53] when god looked at his life he done
[39:55] everything god asked him to do when god
[39:57] looked at abraham's life it said he
[39:58] staggered out the promise of god church
[40:01] let's be strong in praise giving god
[40:03] glory because he's our father amen
[40:06] he'll look past your faults
[40:08] he's going to look past those and just
[40:10] say that's my daughter that's my son
[40:12] they confess their sin they moved on
[40:15] they kept possessing the land and they
[40:17] got the purple they got they found my
[40:19] perfect will for every area of their
[40:20] life amen
[40:22] hallelujah
[40:24] so what am i saying i'm saying you're
[40:26] born and you are adopted
[40:29] amen
[40:30] you're adopted you're growing in the
[40:32] adoption but you are god's child and so
[40:35] you must do what the father tells you to
[40:37] do praise god
[40:39] that's what i told my brothers in that
[40:40] little minister's meeting i said i'm an
[40:42] adopted pastor when i speak the word of
[40:44] god god speaks to his people god gives
[40:46] them just what they need
[40:48] right
[40:50] and that's the proof the proof is you're
[40:52] still living on the things of god
[40:55] the proof is you still rejoice in the
[40:57] house of god amen
[40:59] that's the proof of it the proof is that
[41:01] you're still here you're still believing
[41:03] i i haven't preached false doctrine if i
[41:05] made a mistake i'm sure someone would
[41:06] let me know
[41:07] but that's the proof of i'm speaking
[41:09] god's word you're god's children you're
[41:11] receiving god's word you're you're
[41:13] groaning in it and you're thankful for
[41:15] it and you're growing closer to god all
[41:17] the time amen just i'm just trying to
[41:19] show the sims and blessing of it praise
[41:21] god i'm receiving word from god i'm
[41:24] preaching it to you it's feeding your
[41:26] soul you're moving on in god your lives
[41:28] are growing closer to god all the time
[41:31] amen
[41:32] or is your life growing more like the
[41:34] beast system which one is it
[41:36] these churches are either going one way
[41:37] or the other the foolish birds are going
[41:39] to have some things that they're not
[41:40] faithful and they let the cares of the
[41:42] world slipping right that's what jesus
[41:43] said
[41:44] but the bride should be fruitful
[41:46] bringing forth more fruit some 30 some
[41:49] 60 some 100 she's got a good ground she
[41:52] got an honest heart praise god
[41:54] but the bullish person won't have all
[41:56] that don't be fully honest they won't
[41:58] have the fruit of the spirit like a real
[42:00] christian will have
[42:03] that's right church
[42:05] that's that's what i can see in the
[42:07] scripture
[42:09] now let's get just look at a few quotes
[42:10] there's no way i have time to get all
[42:12] these here
[42:14] now brother is praying and count down
[42:16] and he says
[42:18] uh he says uh
[42:20] where can i pick this up
[42:23] i was praying he said thank you for
[42:25] giving us good rest he said lord place
[42:27] us position where we need to be at this
[42:28] hour how many would say that's your
[42:30] prayer too
[42:31] i believe i'm out i believe i'm at where
[42:33] i need to be at this hour pastor
[42:36] fathering
[42:37] teaching i believe i'm right where god
[42:39] wants me to be because i've laid it all
[42:40] before him i said god just do whatever
[42:42] you want my life
[42:44] i want to obey all the word of god
[42:47] for we must be at the right place for it
[42:49] to happen
[42:51] and we want to be lord if it's a
[42:52] housewife behind the table if it's a
[42:54] factory man with a wrench in his hand
[42:56] and a testimony if it's the minister and
[42:58] the pulpit or the deacon or trustee or
[43:00] the child at school see that children
[43:02] raise your hand if you go to school here
[43:04] all right there you go amen
[43:06] the teenager in the discussion at the
[43:07] class how many zoom discussions is lydia
[43:09] malcolm this week you won
[43:13] lydia's got one too so they've got zoom
[43:14] discussions in class
[43:17] whatever it is lord let us be there at
[43:19] the right time amen amen
[43:21] wasn't joshua there at the right time
[43:24] gotta have that mercy 400 years right
[43:26] and then joshua came at the right time
[43:28] same thing for you
[43:30] you'll be at the right time right you
[43:32] for your position in life you'll be
[43:34] there right when god wants you to be
[43:36] there
[43:37] he said for we know you promised it it's
[43:39] going to happen because you said so why
[43:41] it's our faith is built there how do we
[43:42] have faith built in god
[43:46] now this is a different i think this is
[43:47] adoption part four
[43:50] man said that's just my church alone i
[43:52] got a right to or whatever i want to do
[43:53] this is my tabernacle i'm telling you
[43:55] now i believe that people are safe he's
[43:56] talking about denominations yes sir i
[43:58] truly believe it but oh how much more is
[44:00] it to walk when you know where you're
[44:02] walking church that's what makes us
[44:04] different we know where we're walking
[44:06] amen we're walking where the apostles
[44:09] have tried amen
[44:11] hallelujah that's what i feel like when
[44:13] we go to those churches i feel like paul
[44:14] going in those uh synagogues of the jews
[44:17] amen i'm walking there i'm bringing
[44:19] caring the word just waiting for them an
[44:20] opportunity to speak praise god
[44:23] see
[44:24] we know we're walking denominations
[44:26] don't know where they're walking god's
[44:27] going to profit or not they can't even
[44:29] walk in the prophetic
[44:30] right they can't walk into those things
[44:32] they'll well a pastor i'll marry this
[44:34] person a second time i'll marry this
[44:36] person the third time they don't
[44:37] understand their relationships they
[44:38] don't even know where they're walking
[44:40] but the bible says one man one wife
[44:42] until death amen
[44:45] that's just one example
[44:47] see they look at this church isn't this
[44:49] what they do this is what you did before
[44:50] you got the holy ghost you staggered
[44:52] stumbled along
[44:54] but he said let's stand in the light and
[44:56] walk in the light and know which way
[44:58] you're headed the lord be with you
[45:01] and church what what is the light unto
[45:03] your path
[45:04] thy word that's what we've got we've got
[45:07] word amen we've got thus saith the lord
[45:10] on the word of god amen
[45:12] so we can walk
[45:14] the right path where denominations can't
[45:17] they're stumbling and bumbling along
[45:19] they don't have thus they hate the lord
[45:20] on the word so they someone in this
[45:22] doctrine they stumble to that one they
[45:23] just stay in their creed keep someone
[45:25] around never move on in things of god
[45:30] oh i should have i should have heard a
[45:32] few more shots from that one
[45:35] hallelujah right because we are not
[45:38] stumbling along we know where we're
[45:40] walking we know where we're heading amen
[45:44] and if each one of you in here now has
[45:47] not been positioning place you might say
[45:49] well i'm nothing but a housewife well
[45:51] brother brad i've never done a thing in
[45:52] my life i'm not a preacher well maybe
[45:53] god brought you here to raise a family
[45:55] of children out of that family of
[45:57] children may come another family of
[45:58] children that would be a preacher
[45:59] that'll send a million souls to christ
[46:02] you had to be here you're here for a
[46:03] purpose did you know that

[46:20] shepherd's going after them he's leaving
[46:22] the 99 to get the one amen remember he

[46:26] out and he said go out one more time and
[46:29] make sure my house is filled amen
[46:32] your life and your
[46:33] your calling in life is to get more
[46:35] people saved to make sure the house of
[46:38] god is filled that's the greatest thing
[46:40] you can do praise god
[46:44] you're here for a purpose
[46:48] amen what if my mom would have been here
[46:51] we would have three less preachers right
[46:53] think about that
[46:54] what if my mom would not have been here
[46:56] would you not have a pastor in akron
[46:58] right
[46:59] but was her part important she wanted a
[47:01] preacher was her part important
[47:02] oh yeah
[47:04] praise god i think about you buddy what
[47:06] if you weren't here
[47:08] see everybody has such an important role
[47:10] male or female young or old everybody

[47:16] purpose for every single person amen
[47:18] they're all practicing his sight praise
[47:20] god
[47:21] and each one's going to play a role in
[47:24] getting people saved for the glory of
[47:26] god
[47:29] well you say all i ever done was harold
[47:31] the cold the old clods or working the
[47:33] field i think out in the evening didn't
[47:35] know how to
[47:36] make my kids a living i looked at the
[47:38] poor little fellows no shoes on i've set
[47:40] and cried i got old buggy and me and
[47:41] molly just went to church he said don't
[47:43] worry brother you just keep loving you
[47:45] loving him he's got a purpose for you
[47:48] so also to his farm and take my wife to
[47:50] church he said don't worry god had a
[47:52] purpose for you just stay right where
[47:54] you are just go on you might not never
[47:56] preach a sermon but you might be the
[47:58] great grandfather of one that will do it
[48:02] amen praise god
[48:04] did you know that god credited now look
[48:06] what he uses glory he says levi
[48:09] so in other words he uses foreknowledge
[48:12] don't worry about you know being like
[48:14] anybody else just be yourself
[48:17] because you are playing a part church in
[48:20] god finishing the temple of god amen
[48:24] filling the heavenly temple the marriage
[48:26] supper you you're doing your part to
[48:29] make sure every seed is filled at that
[48:31] glorious supper amen

[48:36] or to fill outside the holy city in the
[48:38] new jerusalem
[48:39] amen praise god one of the other praise
[48:42] god
[48:44] but what does brother adam say he said
[48:45] don't worry about it because levi paid
[48:47] tithes and he's the loins of abraham
[48:49] when melchizedek met him how many knows
[48:51] that
[48:52] see when he was in the loins in the seat
[48:54] of his great-grandfather the bible
[48:57] claimed
[48:58] from kazakh so in other words church
[49:00] don't worry about what you see trust
[49:02] that god has
[49:03] and god knows your life is going to
[49:05] speak through other people's lives amen
[49:08] god knows your life has an importance
[49:10] it's going to make an impact people are
[49:12] watching how you live and all the
[49:14] obedient acts you do now will bless the
[49:16] future generations if they have some
[49:18] amen
[49:20] hallelujah
[49:21] that's what he tells us
[49:23] whether a factory worker housewife
[49:25] preacher
[49:26] whatever you are be faithful in your
[49:29] life be faithful in your position god
[49:31] will use it greatly in the future
[49:34] think about if you ever thought about
[49:35] that
[49:36] when when moses left egypt think about
[49:39] 400 years of all those families that
[49:40] didn't get to go into exodus
[49:43] were those people just wasted lives no
[49:46] they were instilling in the next
[49:48] generation keep praying
[49:50] keep crying out to god keep being
[49:52] faithful and finally the redeemer came
[49:54] amen god needed all those prayers from
[49:57] all 400 years remember i heard all their
[49:59] cries i need each and every one of them
[50:02] then i'm going to send moses down there
[50:04] to pass it on to the next generation and
[50:07] look what kind of faith moses's mom had
[50:09] she's like i won't let the government
[50:10] touch my son i'd rather put him in the
[50:12] hands of god amen
[50:14] that faith was built in generation after
[50:16] generation may god raise our faith amen
[50:21] it's a generation of praying and god is
[50:23] faithful he's gonna answer he's gonna
[50:25] deliver us for so many generations they
[50:26] just talked about it but one day brother
[50:28] it wasn't talk it was science amen
[50:32] hallelujah
[50:33] the rapture may not come in our
[50:34] generation that's fine let's be faithful
[50:37] with it so the next generation if it
[50:39] does come they'll be ready because our
[50:41] lives push them on to higher heights
[50:43] amen
[50:45] glory to god
[50:47] greater depths and greater love of god
[50:49] hallelujah
[50:50] and if i pass on malachi and lydia
[50:52] connotation can stand there with faith i
[50:55] know dad believed him and what he he
[50:56] didn't have the privilege to to to miss
[50:59] death but we may have that privilege and
[51:01] i'm gonna live like he lived amen
[51:08] hey i could i could i'll tell my
[51:10] children now hey if i really wanted more
[51:11] money i could go to a second job
[51:14] i could do that
[51:15] i could go get a second job i'd go start
[51:17] third job i'd have two jobs i forgot
[51:19] about pastor
[51:20] and teacher
[51:22] see but what would that tell my children
[51:24] i would tell my children
[51:26] that the world's more important than
[51:27] them than the word of god
[51:30] i could skip church and say well i got
[51:32] to work instead and you wouldn't have a
[51:33] preacher on wednesday night
[51:35] i could do that
[51:37] see my life is preaching a different
[51:39] message to them amen
[51:41] money's not the most important thing
[51:43] seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[51:45] then everything else gets added unto you
[51:47] praise god
[51:48] that's the lesson they learn
[51:50] to take the land you put god first amen
[51:57] now providence says by foreign knowledge
[51:59] god pre-existed he was self-existent
[52:05] now god he said what's he going to say
[52:07] there's nothing lost knowing that he
[52:09] knows this attribute him would project
[52:11] something out there younger than he
[52:13] could save then when he did that by four
[52:15] hours he looked down and he saw everyone
[52:17] that would accept it so before the world
[52:19] made god foresaw all those who accept it
[52:24] he said he said he's and he said to save
[52:27] that the only way i can do it will be
[52:29] become thou myself and be made flesh and
[52:32] take the cinnamon upon him and die from
[52:34] that i might be the one that's worshiped
[52:36] because he's the god the object of
[52:38] worship amen
[52:40] so he saw i i know jesse's going to
[52:42] believe i know william's going to
[52:43] believe i know all those saints in that
[52:45] are going to believe so i'm going to
[52:47] make a way for them to be saved amen
[52:50] and i know i'm the only one that can
[52:52] take all their sins so i'm going to make
[52:54] i'm going to predestinate the events of
[52:56] their lives so they can be saved they
[52:58] can possess the land they can overcome
[53:00] through my grace and they can they can
[53:03] know me in the power of my resurrection
[53:05] and the fellowship of my sufferings
[53:09] then you come down and take it upon
[53:11] himself in
[53:12] christ he said you see what i mean
[53:17] he said he did that that he might save
[53:19] you who wants to be saved that's right
[53:22] do you see what i mean by four knowledge
[53:23] the infinite god know it all they saw
[53:25] the lamb save the land before the
[53:27] foundation or put your name on the look
[53:28] of life and he said your name on there
[53:30] and he said that the antichrist would be
[53:32] so religious so good look at the pope
[53:33] right look at that look at all all these
[53:36] religious people they're so good that's
[53:37] fine such a smart man such a religious
[53:40] man he would deceive the very elected if
[53:42] it was possible but it is an impossible
[53:47] because their names were for ordained
[53:48] before the foundation world by election
[53:51] he chose them by predestination they
[53:53] know where they're going amen
[53:56] see because we're walking in the perfect
[53:58] will of god
[53:59] not the foolish virgin where they don't
[54:02] know where they're going but we are
[54:03] possessing the bible promised land that
[54:06] we should possess because it's given to
[54:08] us without saith the lord
[54:12] now who could doubt that brother graham
[54:14] says
[54:14] who could not death he said because
[54:16] that's what paul said
[54:18] church when we got things paul said we
[54:20] can say the same thing who can doubt
[54:21] that
[54:24] because that's the bible that's jesus
[54:25] christ revelation to paul and paul said
[54:28] if you change it one word you're cursed
[54:31] amen
[54:33] so those tape people that say well the
[54:35] pastor don't have to preach so much you
[54:37] just change one word of it
[54:39] and now you curse
[54:40] because you can't say well he preached
[54:42] less now the bible said more he said go
[54:44] to the world preach the gospel to more
[54:46] amen finish the great commission he
[54:48] never said preach less he said be
[54:50] infinite preach in season and honesties
[54:52] in amen
[54:53] and you think you don't think religious
[54:55] people could see that but some of them
[54:56] can't
[54:58] because they got the wrong spirit
[55:00] he said that's what he tells church that
[55:02] the church posits before the foundation
[55:04] of the world when god in his labor pain
[55:07] was bringing forth you know knowing that
[55:08] you would knowing what you would do he
[55:11] positionally placed you into his own
[55:12] body to be a housewife
[55:15] to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a
[55:17] prophet to be this or be that he placed
[55:20] you positionally
[55:22] then he talks about you being filled
[55:24] with the holy ghost
[55:27] how many left the garlic lands of egypt
[55:28] how are you left got in egypt
[55:31] you come through sanitation baptize the
[55:33] promised land
[55:34] amen
[55:35] praise god greet out the holy spirit of
[55:38] god whereby you're sealed to the day of
[55:40] your redemption then god having free
[55:42] destiny in the church said and all the
[55:43] peoples there'll be millions times
[55:45] millions that will walk very religious
[55:46] and be deceived the only ones that will
[55:48] not be deceived were those that came
[55:50] over into the promised land who before
[55:53] the foundation world had their names put
[55:55] on the lamb's book of life and has come
[55:57] over into the promised land and church
[55:59] we're enjoying church tonight amen we
[56:02] enjoy the land amen we enjoy conquering
[56:05] we enjoy overcoming we enjoy knowing
[56:07] we've got the saint the lord amen
[56:10] we enjoy knowing we're in the perfect
[56:12] will of god with the perfect revelation
[56:14] of god's word
[56:16] nominations don't care they can preach
[56:18] preach whatever they want but we need
[56:20] more than that we need thus saith the
[56:22] lord
[56:25] let's get past that one
[56:30] man's praying for the people he said
[56:31] fill them with the holy ghost give them
[56:32] eternal life call them out set them in
[56:34] the ministry give them special jobs in
[56:36] the great vineyard of god i don't want a
[56:37] special job
[56:39] i do
[56:40] if it's a little housewife see that
[56:42] special they'll know it's where to put
[56:45] her if it's a man in the office or in
[56:47] the plant you just know where to put him
[56:48] to do the best work
[56:50] see god knew there's something that you
[56:52] can do that's the best job that can be
[56:54] done
[56:55] praise god man on the street on the farm
[56:58] you know just where to put him thou
[56:59] knowest all things in the place
[57:01] positioning where to place him so father
[57:03] we pray that by the works of the holy
[57:04] spirit this night you'll place them in
[57:06] your kingdom many that raise their hands
[57:08] and god saw you when you raise your hand
[57:10] tonight
[57:14] so church what is this
[57:17] what is this all about
[57:19] possessing the spiritual land this is a
[57:21] lesson where to learn joshua is a lesson
[57:23] to learn from the school master of the
[57:25] law
[57:27] we're looking now at the law of joshua
[57:29] right that was right to the law started
[57:31] right moses started the law
[57:32] just a few years after that 38 years
[57:34] after the the
[57:36] law came they win the promised land so
[57:38] we're looking at the law and saying wow
[57:40] if they just obey the law they would
[57:41] possess natural land
[57:43] and that's a lesson for it right
[57:46] it's a great lesson that we're learning
[57:48] now notice church the law was a school
[57:51] master what is the lesson now remember
[57:54] church judah possessed 112 cities
[57:58] but the bible said if you don't obey the
[58:00] land will vomit out the inhabitants
[58:05] remember there was three years of famine
[58:07] in the days of david because of saul's
[58:09] bloody ways
[58:11] so because he didn't live right in the
[58:13] natural land
[58:15] the land suffered and the people
[58:17] suffered
[58:18] immature character in the land led much
[58:21] suffering
[58:22] and church this grieved the heart of god
[58:25] it greeted the heart of god to see that
[58:27] he brought his people in here and they
[58:29] turn their backs on right after joshua
[58:30] dies they go make idols
[58:32] it green god to have to send judge after
[58:34] judge because they just backside right
[58:36] after the the last judge died
[58:39] and god finally got sped up with it and
[58:41] he kicked him out of the land
[58:44] see the the lesson was they had immature
[58:47] character god was showing immature
[58:49] character will not treat the land the
[58:52] promises of god the right way
[58:55] amen
[58:56] david sinned in the land and the sword
[58:59] never left his house or the land
[59:02] well he had uh bathsheba and then
[59:05] slew uriah
[59:07] he never recovered after that
[59:10] see it was a lesson for us we need more
[59:13] than just supernatural thank god for
[59:15] supernatural david had supernatural he
[59:17] had dance and he had shout he had all
[59:18] these things but he needed something
[59:20] more than that he needed an anchor amen
[59:24] so when the temptation come he would
[59:26] still keep the word of god instead of
[59:27] despising the word of god he needed an
[59:30] anchor to obey the word of god but
[59:32] because he didn't have that anchor he
[59:33] didn't have the baptism of the holy
[59:35] ghost he and his family and the land
[59:37] suffer the lesson is immaturity
[59:41] with great things doesn't get you very
[59:43] far
[59:46] he bloodied his own house
[59:49] and bloodied the land it never left his
[59:50] house
[59:52] children killing children step children
[59:53] killing other children never left this
[59:55] house
[59:57] so what's the lesson
[59:59] satan pulls one of these old testament
[1:00:01] tricks he said bow down now and i'll
[1:00:03] give you all these kingdoms
[1:00:07] he tries to pull on these old
