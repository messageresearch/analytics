mothers Lord God and and just be a real Christian Lord God in this uh in this Dark World Lord God let us just shine his lights Lord God hallelujah may we be cities on the hill that cannot be hidden Lord God and may our light so shine that men might see our good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven as you told us to do Lord God so we thank you God for this day bless us now in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise the Lord we'll take this thought here today oh I just got to text from Brother bang he said James is sick he's been got a stomach flu and so forth so we'll have to pray for him at the end of service so James the birthday was on Friday so we have to do something I missed that one so I told the kids yesterday I said we got to make up for that we gotta maybe we can do that today I don't know we'll see today's supposed to be mom's day Monday we gotta maybe I can do that tomorrow so we thank God for his grace amen thank God for his Mercy so you want to look at this thought just a simple thought on Mary highly favored of the Lord praise God so we uh we look at this scripture here and we see we see this was about bc7 uh so if you study the scripture and you study history you know Jesus was born before it switched over from BC to A.D um so we we see here that the Lord Jesus here his mother was being prepared here by the angel of the Lord Gabriel and I just heard brother Adam say this week you know there's lots of minor angels He said but when God wants to do something great he sends a major Angel he'll send Gabriel he'll send Michael wormwood you know there's other of course numerous angels that we know by name but here God is going to do something major and think about a church you know uh the world the world had been waiting for messiah for 4 000 years they'd heard about him since the Garden of Eden there's going to come one that's going to bruise the head of the serpent he's eventually going to come one and and for four thousand years they'd waited and waited and waited and even 800 years before this Isaiah had prophesied that a virgin would conceive and think about I mean all the different interpretations that that could have come out of that over 800 years well I just think it means a a spiritual version to the word of God and it has to mean that it's been 800 years and this couldn't happen and no no doubt people had wondered about it for hundreds and hundreds and no doubt thousands of years until finally an angel came and finds a virgin here we'd say a teenage girl brother Brandon says a teenage girl and I like I like the the drama brother Bradham gives he said he says every Saturday after synagogue Joseph and Mary they were espoused you know and they would go home to to one of their family's house and just talk about what the the minister said and brother random said one Saturday uh they went home and talked about that Isaiah scripture that a virgin would conceive and they thought my what an amazing thing this would be well wow God is so great someday there's going to come a woman who's going to conceive the Christ child and brother Adam said the reason God could come to them was because the word meant so much to them that they spoke about it when they went home right they were they were both thinking about the word of God so often and they would go home and they would they would just not go to church and say well it was a nice service but which we all thank God for nice services but they would go home and meditate they would take what they heard and then discuss it when they got home now remember church this is also in the Book of Malachi let's go to Malachi it says just a few paper a few turns of the paper over before Matthew there brings to thought this scripture Malachi chapter 2 I believe it is about about those that think about the Lord and meditate on the things of God yeah this just come to came to my mind here let me see if I can find anybody find that one about uh there's a book of remembrance yeah there's I'm sorry chapter 3 verse 16. yeah I'm sorry 316. my friend Jacob all about preached on this recently at the middle school Bible Club so it was fresh on my mind the Malachi 3 16. then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearken now look at that you see it's a cause and effect the more we talk about God the more God will hearken to our desires you have to make sure we fill our conversations with the Lord and all that God has spoken all that God is doing all that God is going to do praise God testifying about what he has done see they when you when they When We Fear God the Bible says we fear God we speak often one to another about God and the Lord hearkens and he hears it now that's exactly what happened with Joseph and Mary Amen brother man said they were just talking about the things of God talking about God fulfilling his word and the anticipation of a messiah coming and then the Bible said a book of remembrance was written before him speaking of the Lord for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name now this must be a book of remembrance for rewards right like the angel told Cornelius he said there's a memorial up in heaven for all your praying you're fasting and you're giving of alms there must be some book of remembrance that's a memorial as well and and the more we talk about God here the more we testify about God here the Bible said God has a book that's written right before him not not our names on the Lamb's Book of Life that's different this is a book of remembrance praise God just like Mary and Joseph talking about the things of God and pretty soon God hearkens to their requests oh my God Amen thank God Hallelujah God hears our prayers amen no and beyond that God here's our conversations praise God God wants to testify in our conversations about his promises and how Faithful Is I admire Mike McCloskey that man has testified for 14 years I believe that God's going to heal him and raise him up out of that wheelchair he still says it he still says I'm already healed I'm just waiting on the manifestation of it just a beautiful testimony now church I believe God's writing that down the Bible said that the more we talk about it God writes it down in heaven amen Hallelujah for them that fear God and that thought upon his name Hallelujah verse 17 and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man's Spirit his son his own son that serveth him now look here God calls you one of his jewels praise God Hallelujah he doesn't call you his trash amen he calls you his jewels amen his valuable stones don't the bible say that we're Lively Stones Hallelujah we're living stones amen we're not a deadstone or we're most stones are dead but not us we're living stones Hallelujah we've got we're stones that have life Hallelujah we have the life of God in us amen so we're solid like a stone we have these attributes like a stone we're part of a foundation we're part of a building but we're not dead we are alive hallelujah oh thank God then he calls us jewels Hallelujah by jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son so here we even see God's mercy to those that talk about him uh God's Mercy is to his his people his jewels his living stones praise God Verse 18 then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked now of course the beginning of Israel but I believe there are some spiritual type Force as well so the ye shall return he and and the Bible says between him that serveth God and him that servth him not so so God is speaking of a faithful remnant of Jews here that because they talk about God all the time they Fellowship about God all the time God's right God right down God writes down their names rather sorry and they make up his jewels and then they will have the ability to discern good and evil Hallelujah like I told virtue I think on should come up for prayer on Wednesday night and and uh I said well her prayer request related to you know being a mature Christian I said remember what the Bible says I said are we going to be milk drinkers are we going to be meat eaters I said and she said the right answer she said we want to eat meat and that's what we want we want to be mature Christians and what is meaning though it's Discerning between Good and Evil in church I'll tell you there's many god let's just go through trials where sometimes we don't know right and wrong sometimes the truth is so close or sometimes a lie is so close to the truth but God allows that because he wants us to go through tests he wants us in the midst of our questions the crowd to him for the answers amen he wants us to learn to lean upon him and every question recognize there is an answer God Is The Answer amen amen hallelujah and that he's writing down all those that talk about God all those that think about that thought upon his name did you ever just do that just think about the name of Jesus Jesus Hallelujah Jesus just think about his name amen and the Bible said he's writing down your name in a book Hallelujah oh thank God and he will remember and then he'll hearken to repress let's do that today praise God on this Mother's Day amen let's let's think about god let's talk about God and let's expect God to hearken to our requests amen God is faithful God does love me God God answers prayer God has answered so many prayers before however God's been gracious to me Hallelujah and I know that I know that he's writing down he's seeing what's going on now he sees my heart praise God and I know he's going to answer my request Hallelujah oh my what a blessing what a great scripture here now regret regarding the the the I want to get to this the highly favored here it just means uh just we I say just means because the Catholic Church makes this uh a scripture of worship of Mary um but it just means that that the Bible or the the concordance says one who's received Grace from the Lord one who's a blessed uh to a certain degree above the Lord and church we just have to you know start you have just have to think about it a little bit that that God has called some people to hire callings than others some people have five talents some people have two or one now that's just the general uh this is General description Jesus gives but we also know there's nine gifts of the Spirit there's five preaching gifts and so people can have a mixture of those and we have to we just have to trust that that like the parable says God knew which or God knew how many talents each worker could handle because the Bible said he gives us talents according to his to his ability the Bible says Hallelujah and so whatever God gives us we ought to be thankful and then we ought to invest in it as much as we can praise God right I mean that's that's just what the parable tells us he gives each one all that according to their ability so think about that you know God God gave uh brother random or God gave John the Baptist and and and Jeremiah and Enoch and and Moses and Joshua these prophets of God he gave them the most amount of responsibility right we we get we have to remember not to be uh not to be discouraged maybe if God didn't make us a prophet which all of us can say amen I mean God didn't make us all prophets if we did we would be having visions from from just a young child because their form from their mother's womb praise God a prophet is formed a prophet is built designed from his mother's womb praise God and so we can all we can all just have confidence that whatever God made us to be that that you know as as long as we yield to God God is going to bring out all that's in our lives and God's going to help us to fulfill uh what he's called us to do like I was talking to Brother John last you know last Saturday brother John grahaman and we're talking about being fulfilled now Church which one of us which one of us wants to be fulfilled like we want to live a life of fulfillment like you know as we go through the years like I thank God I see what God's doing in my life how many want to see what God's doing in your life I mean I think that's one of the greatest blessings we could have is in other words that we know we're in the will of God we feel we feel fulfilled and the best way to do that is to obey the word of God hallelujah and to keep to keep the commands of God hallelujah to be fulfilled and so Mary you know she that scripture and think about that the scripture meant so much sir from Isaiah about a virgin shall conceive because she was the one that was going to do it got it ordained her that scripture now which scriptures mean a lot to you amen hallelujah I believe there's some key in there there's some key to your life in there Hallelujah the verses that mean so much to you now we all look at the Rapture verses that means a lot to us hallelujah it does mean a lot to us that's why we're living like we're leaving amen praise God we should live our lives like we're going to leave this place behind amen because here we have no continuing City but there we go to a city whose Builder and maker is God hallelujah amen and it's a kingdom it's a city that cannot be moved Hallelujah that's where we're going praise God and we see you know this scripture about highly favored you know there's think about that there's going to be no other woman like Mary a virgin that would conceive there was no other uh interesting there's I mean there's only two men that never died you're not gonna Elijah there's no other places until the the bride of Christ praise God who's changing a moment a drinking of an eye amen there's just a few that are chosen in these things you know and and those people that have chosen are highly favored but it's not all a bed of roses we do got some roses out there everybody let it be a reminder that it's not all the better roses there's some thorns on the Roses as we'll see here with Mary you know I I just flipped over my Bible and I was looking at the wrong chapter and it went right to the chapter I I actually would like to read uh so we go to Luke 11 here I thought was really really something Luke 11 27 and 28. I was looking for Luke 1 28 I went to Luke 11 28 by accident but it turned out to actually work really good Luke 11 27 and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and say on him blessed is the womb that barely suck and the paps which thou has sucked now look again here's this Mary worship right so I'm blessing the woman that brought forth the Christ child blessed is she now no doubt she was blessed we just read it the Bible said she was highly favored but in this case the person has has put the wrong influence the wrong uh Honor on Mary in this sin in this situation the honor wasn't supposed to go to Mary the honor Jesus directs where the honor goes it is a great blessing for Mary to have brought forth the Christ child it was a great blessing for Enoch and Elijah not to die but God Jesus plainly tells us there's greater blessings than that praise God in other words the the main blessing we should seek for is to keep the word of God hallelujah amen not to we don't want to get on the the side of you know worshiping someone or giving someone too much honor like they do to brother Bradham right like they do some people do to uh to John Wesley right or Martin Luther they give them too much honor right we we must honor all God's servants and Mary and we must honor the Bible says to do that the Bible said there are a cloud of witnesses up in heaven praise God but we can't we don't want to go too far because Jesus says blessed are they rather that hear the word of God and keep it praise God oh it's a great blessing for us to hear the word of God and keep it and remember that great scripture Jesus told uh Thomas he said you're more blessed to have not seen a miracle and still believed well in our minds we think well I've been seen America I'm not blessed but Jesus said you're more blessed if you believe when you haven't seen amen amen so see our thinking is often opposite of what gods is right because we just we get carnal we're prone to wonder Lord I feel it praise God prone to leave the God I love so what we need is the right meditations upon the word of God in other words be thankful for what God's done in our life be thankful for the favor God has given to us amen because what does favor mean favor means Grace if you actually look at the definition of Grace it means favored and you're saved by what God's grace you're saved by God's favor and it was not any work of your own it was not a work of I wasn't saved by my grace or my favor I was saved by God's grace and favor Hallelujah not by my works by God's works so I just want to start with that that Luke one there what a beautiful scripture here and I'll be good I'll be getting that back to that in a moment but I just want to say how what brother Brandon said here about mothers I want to read this I and I'm not sure I read this every year but Brother Brad says quote mayor I'm sorry mother is so great now this is not worship right let's let's make sure we say we're not worse been married today and we're not worshiping our moms because they're not worthy of worship but they are worthy of honor mother's so great you know the first one that receives you in this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart she's the first one to know you the first two in this life to hold you then when you're born she's the one she's the first hands that touch you and wipes back the tears out of your eye she's the first one to Pat you and to love you and to coo over you I've seen it eight times Kristen's really good at cooing in this in this life is your mother now I think that there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother mother is the first with the child and she's a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has a responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's why mothers has a special little touch think about you know Brotherhood talks about Jacob bed being jacobed you know guided Moses's life she told him there's a prophecy on your life you're meant to be a deliverer you were drawn out of water you should you know according to the world you should have been killed but God rescued you and God exalted you and he never forgot that at 40 years old it came into his heart and he tried to fulfill that promise with his own power but he found out I could only kill one Egyptian I can kill one stink in Egyptian with my own power but with God's power all things are possible with God's power amen and all the credit of Moses like brother rabbit says he said give that credit to jochebed who formed his character think about John the Baptist John the Baptist and think about Samson these men couldn't they were nazarites they could not achieved their purpose unless their moms had kept them from the wine and Samson from cutting his hair think about that Samson never would have had a gate a massive two-ton gate or whatever on his shoulders Samson never would have ripped the line apart unless the mom obeyed the word of God oh mothers amen may God encourage our mothers today amen keep the word of God hallelujah honor God's word train your children up in the ways of God God will use them and bless them beyond our wildest thoughts amen like my mom I was texting my mom today telling her how much I loved her happy Mother's Day and probably be better if I just read it I'll probably chop it up she said my dear son you and your siblings have made me say it was worth all the hardship and suffering we went through together in Christ Jesus our lord Hallelujah amen it was worth it all to see children that love the Lord and want to serve God hallelujah she's got three preachers out of all that suffering too praise God hallelujah thank the Lord for that she said I'm so thankful for children that are serving their Lord and Master the Lord Jesus Christ have a wonderful day with your precious family I think that's a special praise God but you know brother man said the same thing about uh Abraham Lincoln you know he only had a few books growing up one of them was the Bible and brother Adam said that I don't know if this is true but he said Abe Lincoln said if there could be any good thing found in me it's because of a Godly mother that reared me to serve the Lord I don't know if Abe Lincoln said that but brother Ram said he did now I don't know if that's right or not all I know is that I if he did say that I agree with it because my life was formed mainly by my mother right and so that's why I like that I like the man he says not sure if this is oh yeah he said uh if there's any good found in me praise God let it be because of the influences that were upon me praise God and church don't you know God he orchestrated all those influences to be around you as a child so you'd raise up and you become the person the christ-loving person that you are today praise God Amen Hallelujah even though even in some of the darkest testimonies like we've heard brother Austin say his childhood you know even in some of the darkest cases God was still in that God was still forming a testimony from that right because now Austin will he will change the cycle praise God he will he will overcome the curse praise God because he's been on that side of it so even in our pain God's with us in the pay just like he's with us on the Mountaintop praise God like my uncle told me who passed away you know the reason your dad left you is so you'll never leave your children and I agree I agree I know what it's like to be left but it's a lesson I learned but I also learned that Jesus never left me praise God and all that amen and I can handle it because he was with me praise God and he promised he would not give me anything he would not give you anything that you and I could not handle right temptation is common to all men praise God but with every Temptation he makes a way of Escape Hallelujah ah there's always an exit door there's always a way out and God always shows us the way out and God makes us more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I just want to encourage you brother Adam says he says Mother's Day He says they make a lot of money out of off of Flowers and Things but Mother's Day should be every day not send her a bunch of flowers on mother day but love her and care for her 365 days and nights through the year but of course the commercial world has got a great hold on in these things like this and it depreciates the mother look so Mother's Day depreciates if you only do nice things for her on Mother's Day it actually decreases her value well she's she's only valuable one day out of the year that's why every day's got to be Thanksgiving Every Day's got to be Mother's Day every day's got to be Christmas let me say this every day ought to be Father's Day no I'm just kidding every day is Father's day because you all love me so well my family my wife loves me so well every day is Father's day I'm just glad I got a Heavenly Father praise God that's that because that's all that really matters I'll fail as a father every every father mother Earthly mother father will fail we honor them but God is the ultimate mother and father we thank God for his grace today Hallelujah brother says oh he's talking about a sinner oh well last Mother's Day I sent her a bunch of flowers brother Brandon said she'd appreciate a whole lot more if you just sat down and talked to her just a little bit he says write her a line which might be a telegram what do they call those what was it was it telegram the old-fashioned text messages that cost a lot of money to send one he said or Pat her on the shoulder so today you might want to Pat your mom on the shoulder kiss her on the cheek tell her you love her he said it'll go a lot further than all the flowers that you can buy from the florist so let's remember that today and like I said I know there's harder situations than others you know we talked about that but even in the midst of the trials that's an opportunity to express the Divine Love Of Christ I thank God for our family members our brothers who do that like guys our sisters who do that it's not always easy but God's grace overcomes Hallelujah now brother bam even says in what was the Holy Ghost given for 1959 he talks about a uh he said he's talking about a young young lady he said you might be the best dressed woman in the country you might be the prettiest you might be the best built you might be a idol to your husband you might be all these things which that's wonderful now of course it doesn't mean it's actually wonderful if you're an idol you say in other words you might you might look pretty he says but that's wonderful but sister unless you have the Holy Ghost in you which is eternal life at the end of this road you're finished right so no matter what natural blessings we do or don't get the the end of the road is what we're looking for we want a life that that tells everybody at the End of the Road God gave me eternal life amen all of our life is fleeting all of our our good looks or whatever our our happy whatever whatever we have you know whatever we have naturally it's just it's just carnal there's going to come to an end to it but there is no end to the Life of Christ amen there's no end to eternal life there's no end to the love of Jesus Hallelujah and brother Adam tells us so see we want to honor our our wives and mothers without worshiping them just like but I said you can't hardly honor mom enough right because of all that she does think about that in this age of abortion where over 65 some million babies have been aborted that's just on record out of all those that lost their lives Your Mother by God's grace kept you for those nine months right and she'd she'd rub you there she'd sing to you there I don't know what to do she'd feel your kicks hey stop kicking like that honey but she took care of you she carried you for all those nine months she suffered all those through nine months and now look what you are today praise God so there's honor that can be given and we see the same thing with uh as we said with Prophets brother Ram said this last day Prophet Messenger will have such power before the Lord Jesus that there will be those who mistake him for the Lord Jesus he said there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some of them to believe this because Matthew 24 says for there shall rise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that ever were possible they shall deceive the very left he said behold I've told you before wherefore if they shall say to them behold he's in the desert going out forth behold he's in the secret Chambers believe him not brother says don't you believe it the the last day Prophet messenger is not Jesus Christ he's not the Son of God he is one of the Brethren a prophet a messenger a servant of God he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which John received which he was the voice that cried I am not he but he is coming after me praise God think about the honor that men of God got in the Bible if I'm not mistaken when Moses died I Think They Mourn for a whole month if I'm not mistaken either him or Aaron no matter which one Moses might have been longer than a month now the longest funeral I've ever been to is just a few hours they'd spend a whole month in the funeral service for one one man one man that's a great honor so this is the point we're making it's okay to honor someone there's an old saying that we always they always play at uh the Veterans Day assembly it takes uh I'm sorry it takes a moment to acknowledge someone it takes an hour um just show someone you love them it takes a whole day to say you appreciate them but it takes a lifetime to forget them I thought was a nice I I mix it up I mean we could I could go on go and look it up real quick but there's this idea that you know if you really want to honor somebody it takes more time each time and then when someone passes like we've experienced family loss you know this this year then it takes a whole lifetime to forget that person because of the great love they poured out because of the care they showed because they provided for us because they loved us praise God and so this is a great it's a great thing Church to honor one another as long as it's not worship it's a great thing we see it all through the scripture and so we want to make sure we do that by God's grace I think it's a great thing to do that's why I try to build build honor into honoring my wife every week a couple times a week by the grace of God how can I honor my wife in a way that's uh that strengthens her how can I do that and so I Seek You know I seek to find more ways to do that by the grace of God by God's grace amen now I want to go back to Luke 1 28 praise God I'm gonna go back to Luke 1 20. okay here we go so church I encourage you to do that as well you know honor your husband honor your wife honor your mother honor your father find ways to do it now I've had this one on my calendar for a couple years my mom was here to cancer on August 17th so I want to find a way to honor my mom on August 17th I haven't got to it this year but I thought wouldn't it be good just take a just take a morning and honor the fact that God healed it's kind of that thought of memorials you know well there's nothing wrong with that we ought to take some time hopefully this year I can get it by God's grace because it's coming up we're almost there it's May June July August I only got three months away to August I got three months away till the next school year starts oh I'm dreading that right now we'll make it by God's grace um and so it's a good thing it's a good thing to do these things now Luke 1 28 going back here it says and the angel came into her and said hail now hail just means peace be with you or Joy be with you doesn't mean like hail like hail Hitler or something like that it just means God's peace be with you or Joy be to you peace be on you and then the Bible says here uh she was trouble I'm sorry no yeah hail Thou Art highly favored which means uh graciously accepted or much grace so God has accepted you in heaven and also God has given you much favor hallelujah praise God church we ought to be thankful whatever favor we've got from God we ought to be thankful for that because what if that favor wasn't there if you didn't have what what's the opposite of favor if you don't have God's favor what do you have you have God's punishment he's either for you God he's either for you or against you we ought to say praise God that he's for us hallelujah thank God I have some favor with God hallelujah whatever portion that is no matter how much or how little praise God want to be thankful that God has given me some favor God has given me some Grace Hallelujah people have confidence in my prayers or people people like the fellowship with me people like what I say about the Lord we ought to we ought to appreciate that and church I believe this I believe each one of us are highly favored praise God I'm just going to try to get to my main point here I'm gonna have to jump ahead my punch line that's the point I'm making as my title is Mary highly favor the Lord each one of us are highly favored of God in some way Glory hail Thou Art highly favored now I like what Albert Barnes the uh I think he was a Baptist preacher if not mistaken from the 1800s before this Eagle age came in he was under the man age he had the right anointing he said now by being mother of the long expected Messiah Mary was highly favored the mother of the Redeemer of mankind think about that long had he been predicted long had the eyes of the nation been turned to him and long had his coming but an object of intense desire to be reckoned even among Jesus's ancestors was accounted a sufficient honor for even Abraham and David just being in his family lineage meant a lot I mean don't people take advantage of that today well I'm the descendant of George Washington or you know I I mean it's an honor I I met someone a few years ago I can't remember who it was they were like the great great of some president I can't remember who it was but I was like wow you can trace it back somebody visited our school a couple years ago I can't remember who might have been Ben Franklin or John Adams or somebody one of the founding fathers here's the actual descendant I'm thinking wow this is quite an honor because your your ancestor had an amazing impact on the natural country and think about our great ancestry Jesus Christ had a great impact on all of Heaven's history Heaven's history and Earthly history praise God and then he says and then he says you are my offspring in Acts 17. wait Lydia what family you come out of Jesus's family brother amen who's your dad God almighty's your dad oh my you can go all the way back it takes a lot of Honor praise God that gives a lot of honor to you right we're we're not fatherless we're not motherless we're not orphans we're Children of the king hallelujah amen we're chilling the most high God in church at some point the whole world is going to recognize because we the Bible said we'll Rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years Hallelujah those the heathens or whatever they are whatever they are the Gentiles that during the millennial Reign they'll recognize that we were the family of God hallelujah for a thousand years when we have glorified bodies and they've got natural bodies my goodness Hallelujah if you can feel this good you know if you can feel this good in a teenage body milk how you how good are you going to feel in a glorified body if you can be that strong how good are we going to feel in a glorified body see it was a it was an honor just to be of the lineage of David or the the tribe of Judah oh the Messiah is going to come out of Judah you're in the family of the Messiah now did that make the Levites any worse no no did that make the those of Simeon any worse no no no no no but it just was their calling it just was their lot in life right so see there's people some people are going to have certain Graces given to them that you may not have but don't feel bad you've got God's grace as well praise God Hallelujah and like you know I've always gone back to that quote brother man I can't explain it my brother Adam says how much a great reward will some of these sisters get he says in the visible Union if I'm not mistaken or is it chose uh choosing of a bride brother bam said some of our sisters are going to get a greater reward than the brothers because they've had to suffer more persecution because of the way they dress and they have to give up more to become a believer that's quite a statement I'm still looking for some scripture on that but the same is true you know whatever you suffer you you're rewarded for your amount of suffering so it's something to consider but here it's a great blessing just to be in the lineage of Christ he says but Albert Barnes says but now the happy individual Mary was designated was to be his mother and on Mary no actually I'm going to stop right there before I read this next part because I want to get to that here notice the word Grace means favor Mary was highly favored and so are we remember the scriptures you know Ephesians 1 3. Ephesians 1 3 said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ ah Church whenever we go to feeling bad we ought to open up our Bibles and read this I have every spiritual blessing that I need of right whether I'm experiencing right now or not I've got it Hallelujah that's what I mean either God's a liar right or not God's telling the truth hallelujah the truth sets me free praise God I've got every spiritual blessing that I'll receive there then I'll receive and open myself up to praise God amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah in the name of Jesus thank God now verse 4 says he chose us in Christ we looked at that recently in in Christ before the foundation of the world and then verse 5 we're predestinated to be adopted as his children now we all know the adoption process right uh the family's got to go to court it's a big deal I've had a couple of kids in my class over the years being adopted and they go to court they take a picture and it's the happiest day of the child's life because before his previous family abandoned him but now the previous family said I don't want you I don't want you I can't take care of you but then the new family says I want you I'll take care of you I'll provide for you I'll be a mother I'll be a father oh that's what God did to us amen hallelujah the world made us orphans the world rejected us the world left us for dead religion left us half dead Hallelujah but Jesus Christ comes and he adopts us into his family praise God he said I care about you I'm bringing you in you get all the benefits of being in my family let's take a picture you got a certificate you're adopted and here's my certificate praise God I'm in the family of Christ I'm adopted I got a new daddy and mommy praise God there's my certificate let's take a picture Jesus thank you Lord I'm in your family now hallelujah thank God Amen I'm not an orphan I'm not alone I got someone that will watch over me praise God in church he has done that very thing praise God watched over me protected me guided me strengthened me helped me praise God that's what he did he predestinated me to be adopted in other words he knew the whole time there was never not there was never a time when when God didn't know I wonder if I'll adopt sister so and so I wonder I wonder if I'll bring brothers so and so to my family no the whole time it was all determined he knew the plan he knew the day he knew the hour he knew the church service praise God he know this he knew the sermon you needed to hear or the song that you need to hear praise God he knew exactly what you needed it was already determined amen Hallelujah you're adopted as children of God by Jesus Christ to himself Hallelujah he chose me to be in his family Hallelujah in one way I chose him another way he chose me that's right now look at verse six now here's Albert Barnes goes to verse six Ephesians 1 6. thank you to show that we are highly favored now I just all those other verses would have applied to to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved beloved means the heart of God in other words the Throne of God we are accepted in Heaven's Tabernacle today amen we're accepted at the throne we're not rejected God's not turning down our prayers because he doesn't like us or we're heathens or workers of iniquity we're workers of righteousness and we are already accepted in the Beloved praise God already so please let's remember we are highly favored maybe not in the way Mary was but that's okay God God's choice is best right and I said man I'm glad God didn't choose me for that it would be impossible right but God did choose you for something praise God Hallelujah and you are highly favored now I just wrote this down you know just as a reminder you know Mary was highly favored and uh and she is she was chosen for this purpose and somebody say well she's more highly favored than maybe Rebecca or or Ruth or someone like that but remember church when heaven was searched in Revelation chapter 5 When Heaven Was searched for somebody worthy the Bible said no man can be found they searched all Heaven All Earth they even searched the Angels there's no angel that was Worthy no one was worthy to take the promises of God the book of redemption no one was worthy to take that and open it other than Jesus Christ praise God so all any honor we give to somebody and any any blessing they have in their testimony it's wonderful we thank God for that but it's so small in comparison to the honor of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because this is what crisis it's different than just honoring and thanking God you know for for each one of our lives and our testimonies it's wonderful we ought to do that more but there's an honor that's reserved there's a worship that's reserved for only Jesus Christ Hallelujah and all heaven will recognize only Christ gets the worship praise God so it's a great balance praise God and remember we know the scripture all 24 Elders not one of them kept their Crown when Jesus come out and did that not one of them said you know what I'm not going to cast my credit I think I'm going to keep my crown on not one of them all 24 not one of them stood up and said we really appreciate the Lord no no each one of them bowed down in worship and said we are not worthy I got this Crown because you you fought like Malachi sang last week I'm fighting a battle Christ's already won for me praise God he gave me the grace overcome he protected me he's the one that gave me favor each one of those Godly men with all those rewards and all that honor realized they only got the honor because of God's grace Hallelujah not one of them kept their crown and say well I you know I'm a pretty good guy now I think I thank God for Jesus but I'm a pretty good guy no they all realize I'm nothing without Christ for without Christ you can do nothing Hallelujah that's right and then you know then the other side of that is in Revelation Jesus says you'll walk with me in white because you are worthy there's none worthy to be worshiped like Jesus but then we can walk a life worthy of the Gospel we can obey Hallelujah like like I read that quote a few weeks ago by the man said try just try your best praise God sees that we're trying our best and God God is pleased with that praise God he's not expecting Perfection but he's expecting he's expecting us to lovingly sacrifice right to make our bodies a Living Sacrifice unto God thank God Hallelujah actually I turn on my flashlight there part now here's what I want to I just want to uh read this or what Albert Barnes said here he says but now the happy individual was designated who was to be his mother Mary and on Mary look Church a poor version of Nazareth was to come this honor which would have rendered infinitely illustrious any of the daughters of Adam the honor of giving birth to the world's Redeemer and the son of God this this is a beautiful thought who did God choose a poor teenage woman from Nazareth it'd be like it'd be like a poor person from the slums of Akron can any good thing come out of the inner city of act well LeBron James did but you don't do much good for God right he's on the left side he's the woke side you know can anything good come out of the slums here and yet God when he's looking for someone who who can I highly favor he goes to the least expected place he doesn't go to the castle the king he doesn't go you know to the the wealthy he goes to the poor when God wants to honor a woman he goes to the humble women praise God you don't go to the celebrities of this world you don't go to celebrities praise God he goes to the low this world and makes him a celebrity in heaven hallelujah thank God I love this praise God he goes to the lowest Town Nazareth and he goes to the lowest income class the poor to find I want and when God finds somebody he wants to honor he goes to the meekest of the meek so church we ought to be encouraged praise God no matter what our history is no matter what our current life is like let's be like Mary like the Bible said let's Ponder the word of God in our hearts let's keep these promises in our hearts and talk about them all the time praise God because God is writing down who's doing that and then God will hearken to their prayers at the right time and season like God I'll just dramatize it 18 years ago up in Indiana an Amish man came out of the Honors Community and got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for 18 years he said Lord he said please save an Amish church and may they all get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so for all those 18 years God was looking for a church to do that in right oh my that's just powerful praise God 18 years he kept asking God and you all got to see it last week was that a good surprise or what do you like when I surprise you like that I don't tell you guests are coming well there's a couple reasons I do that I don't want us to try to be more spiritual than we normally are right even myself included and then also I don't know if they're coming you know sometimes people cancel so I don't want to announce something and they don't come but here this man for 18 years he just kept praying God I know you can do it not I'm just dramatizing oh and maybe over the over the years 18 years there's a couple of disappointments like it looked like this church was really going to receive it but then they didn't look like finally a church my goodness but then finally when the right time comes brother random says the promises of God circle the Earth and they're waiting for people to get in their position and when they get in their position the timing's right that promise comes down and anoints the individual and that person gets inspired and they do the will of God and God fulfills his promise Hallelujah said that promise for 800 years Circle diversion shall conceived and think of all the turns of the sun think of all the seasons winter spring summer fall all the all the seasons they went through till finally there's somebody that's meditating on the word finally is the right time this the right person a poor little person an insignificant person out of an insignificant Town God said that's a kind I'm going to use because it shows the character of God he takes the meek and makes them strong praise God hallelujah he takes the humble praise God and gives them honor Hallelujah he honors the poor virgin daughter Mary of this awful town he finally finds somebody that's obeying his word praise God he bites now God bypassed all those 800 years of young Israeli women to find Mary now the Bible proves they're poor Luke 2 24. now Joseph Pride was a pretty good Carpenter but he wasn't a rich man he was no rich man and maybe with carpentry it's hard to get rich maybe it's easier to get rich in those days with you know bullocks goats sheep right like Abraham and Isaac Jacob Luke 2 24 and this is when the Bible says Mary and Joseph brought Jesus on the eighth day to be circumcised and give them the name Jesus and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons now Albert Barnes says those who are able on such an occasion were required to offer a lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon or turtle dove for a sin offering if not able to bring a lamb they were permitted to bring two turtle doves or two uh young pigeons that's in Leviticus 12 6 and Leviticus 12 8. so did Mary Joseph bring a lamb and a turtle dove no they just brought two birds so they were the poorest they were on the level the poorest and let me ask you Church even though they were poor was God still interested in them even though they were there even though they were poor man even though they were poor did God still highly favor Mary or not you see no matter what struggles we have in our lives we have to remember the spiritual favor of God is way more valuable amen than the natural favor of man or the devil right because the devil offered Jesus I'll give you all these kingdoms I'll give you all this I'll give you and we know all the musicians that have sold their souls to Satan for riches and popularity like Bob Dylan who admitted it on the Live 60 Minutes interview he said he sold his soul for Satan so he could be a be rich and famous and that's just natural I'd rather have the favor of God in a small Church of 15 people then a million subscribers or 50 million subscribers on iTunes or Instagram or whatever you got I'd rather take the way with the Lord to spies for you and have spiritual favor with God even if I just got one blessing from God I'd rather have one blessing of God than a million blessings from the Devil that's right Hallelujah amen thank God and notice she comes in a state of poverty bringing Jesus to be circumcised and God has shown that it is not dishonorable to be poor it's not a dishonor to be poor if that's the case then Mary was a dishonor to God she was no dishonor to God she was an honor to God no station in life is dishonorable where God places us he knows what is best for us and he often makes a state of poverty an occasion of the highest blessings I'm quoting Barnes now if with poverty he grants us as is often the case peace contentment and religion is worth far more than all the jewels or all the gold of Mexico in this case I'll say the goal to Fort Knox okay or the gold of the Vatican how about that if it be asked why since the Savior was pure from any moral defilement in his conception of birth it was necessary to offer such a sacrifice Okay the reason of sacrifice had to be offered is because the Bible said it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness so why did Jesus need to sacrifice him he's a holy baby well because they got to fulfill the word of God in other words Mary had to go to church just like everybody else had to go to church can I say like this Mary had to pay her ties and offerings just like everybody had to pay toxin offers right right God wants to see if we'll humble ourselves and obey God in the little things and then God can bless us in Greater spiritual things that's right now let me move on to this next thought here by God's grace I always feel a little pressure on Mother's Day like I wanna I was praying this morning like Lord that every sister feel encouraged when she leaves this place and don't forget the brothers too I don't want them to feel just a certain pressure I don't know we've had some good Mother's Day Services over the years you know I remember some of them like Leah loves the Lord and some other ones in there but I just want the Holy Spirit to bless each person praise God Luke 2 34. now the next chapter Luke 2 34 and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary's mother behold this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against now look Jesus was was was came for for the rise of the Apostles rise in what in finances no how about popularity did they get more popular because they were Apostles no they actually got more hated this rise mean this rise has to mean in the blessings of God Hallelujah Jesus is set for the rising of many but also the falling of many in other words Jesus everyone's reaction to Jesus would either help them rise in God or fall in God think about that Judas Rose for a while but then he fell at the towards the end of his life of course he had the thief's heart this whole time we're told in the Book of John chapter 12. but Jesus came and when he was when when I'm sorry Jesus came and went when Judas was sincere he was rising in God he had power he had Authority he cast out devils but pretty soon Jesus also revealed what was in his heart and because of Jesus he because Jesus truth and everything he and and Jesus was talking about honesty and not stealing it revealed his fall and he loved the world and so he fell right Jesus either makes you rise or fall Hallelujah thank God Church you ought to be so happy today we ought to be so thankful today that I see Christ helping me rise my life's not going down in in curses my life is rising in God's mercy and blessings praise God Hallelujah I was already low in sin and shame I was already addicted to sins and I already had a life that was falling away from God hallelujah but when the real Christ when the real message came to me church I see nothing but rising in Christ amen we're Rising with with more Authority with more wisdom and more understanding God is here Christ is here to help us rise today Hallelujah let me say like this may God help you to rise to the occasion to overcome the Temptation you're battling right now that's what he come for to help you rise Hallelujah shade but to rise in Victory and repentance and overcoming Grace he wants you to rise up out of your place Hallelujah amen that's why he came Hallelujah to help us rise and the church said that's what the that's what the prophet Simeon said he's a minor Prophet right because the Lord spoke to him and said hey I got a revelation for you you're going to see my you're going to see my Messiah before you die I hope that's true for us praise God I mean the Rapture amen hallelujah praise God I hope we see Christ before we die I just found that quote brother man said it in the I can't remember the I think it was in this questions and answers but Rob said Jesus may not come for a hundred years and look we're getting pretty close to that he said that 1963. here we are 2023 we're already past the halfway point in the hundred years halfway point if time keeps going fast like it is now we're going to be there pretty soon so let's be ready praise God no man knows the day or the hour praise God let's be faithful to God hallelujah let's trust God let's see God with all that we have praise God let's trust in the Lord and help us rise above our trials Hallelujah amen reminds me that Chris Tomlin song out of the Ash's room we rise you know there's no one like you our God is greater our God is stronger amen he helps us rise out of our destitute condition spiritually now this is what he tells his mom because of your son which was really God's son not really her son many are people are going to rise some will rise and some will fall and people are going to speak against your son now look at that isn't it just gracious of the Holy Ghost to let you know you got some trials coming ahead people are going to speak against you verse 35. and now look at this no we we all let me say this right away we all honor Mary and think wow what if I could have been that or what if what an honor but let's not forget this the suffering she went through yay so so many people are going to rise because of this boy but also you're going to get spoken against and a sword a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also what this isn't a natural sword this is a spiritual sword in other words God who's going to test this means she's going to be tested the very heart the very core of her being is going to be tested and this is the mother we're preaching about for Mother's Day this now which one of our mothers won a sword thrust through their heart all right none of our money but this was what she was called for we all remember all the honor oh she's the she's the Virgin that conceived we that's that's a lot of Honor for that but here comes suffering that goes along with that honor praise God a sword through your heart through not into Rue aren't those the most powerful attacks right when something will actually go through your body when those wouldn't those be the most painful so you're blessed you're highly favored but you got a sword coming through your soul in other words you will be tested to the Limit you'll be tested beyond measure right and every every Jewish woman would have said oh I want to be the Virgin that would conceive I want to bring forth the Redeemer I want to bring forth all all Mankind's Redeemer but you want to suffer like Mary's going to suffer thoughts of many hearts may be revealed now I have all the quotes there I'm not going to read them all but brother man said everywhere Mary went she was spoken against she was called an illegitimate mother because they all thought she had fornication with the man so she had this she had these great spiritual experiences with angels with uh Simeon the prophet but then everywhere she went publicly her life was a Public Disgrace everybody looked down on her so she was poor everybody looked down on her but God said you're highly favored so what do they come down to church it depends on who you're going to believe whose side are you standing on praise God like that song says whose report will you receive we shall receive the report of the Lord see we think it's all bed and Roses a bed of roses for Mary like it was some easy life it was a difficult challenging life she saw many rise like Peter hallelujah amen like James and John Hallelujah sons of zebony praise God but she saw many people fall as well and then she herself suffered this sword piercing through her soul now I'm not certain church but I imagine that that sword was the test at the cross I don't know but what what other what other experience could be so difficult that it would be compared to a sword piercing through your own soul how about your child being crucified and to know that the child was innocent healed the sick raised the dead healed lepers and and she doesn't she's not hid from that she has a front row seat in that what could be harder than that and this is the woman who's highly favored of the Lord praise God is it sinking in deep today praise God the sink in let that word become a part of me let me be able to accept the trials that I go through and help me to remember that I'm highly favored despite all the trials helped me to accept that Church there are so many times and you've seen it you've seen me you'll just see me cry many times I'll just cry at the end of a service sometimes church I'm just crying because I think about what Jesus went through on the cross sometimes I just cry because of that I think he suffered all that he was taking my shape he was taking the punishment that I deserved right all the pain of the cross even beforehand in the in the in the trials he was slapped and mocked and his beard ripped out Psalm says that the gospel doesn't say that Psalm says his beard was ripped out sometimes I just think about the cross and I'll just cry in in my in my hardest trials you know in my most difficult trials where the lord always brings me back is to the Cross of Christ I got to remember despite my faults or my failures or my trials Jesus suffered more than I could ever imagine he suffered far beyond me he was beaten to a man a man could even call him a man and the Bible says Mary watch this and it was like a sword was struck right through her soul wounded just endure this wound imagine all the movies we've seen right I'm sword fighting and people getting stabbed and it's this is what her experience was yet she's highly favored you see all those preachers say you're highly favored you're all blessed that's true that's so true that's so true but there are sufferings that go with it I thank the Lord for the cross praise God he's made us to rise and church the beautiful part is Jesus his word has come to you and it's revealed what's in your heart now for all of us the majority of us it's revealed good things right but each one of us can say well there's still places where the word has revealed I'm not being obedient in including brother Jesse all of us the word always reveals what's in our heart always never fails to amaze me all the times I preach it it'll impact somebody's heart and I appreciate everybody letting me know when I got another one the other day how the service was just what the person needed to hear I thought well God is so good that's the word he's revealing the thoughts and intents of our heart Hallelujah and so that's what Christ does he comes to show us now church for the for all of us we've risen to some degree but we've got to be able to rise higher as well Hallelujah I got that in there brother amen I said you are standing with him today you're standing on his side and that's what the song he's saying I like little things like that Hallelujah so Mary was going to suffer at the cross her soul would feel like it was cut and Pierce and and just broken through my soul is broken is what she would say yet she's highly favored in heaven yet she's blessed with extra Grace above marriage I tell you she was blessed above measure of amen hallelujah and the greatest blessing was is that the the next morning after she come early before the dawn I'm sorry two days later praise God that was the greatest blessing praise God even though the word was crucified even though she felt like she was pierced through she still came to give honor to the Son of God hallelujah not just because it was her son because the angel said he's the savior of the world Amen and she said I rejoice in God my savior praise God in other words she needed a savior she needed forgiveness and she came to honor the the Christ who had died she came to honor them honor him praise God but then God did a great thing God raised him from the dead forevermore once and die but forever he'll live Hallelujah oh my and God had that great blessing in that trial Hallelujah so she felt cut all the way through God bless her with the resurrection of her son praise God oh it's so beautiful how many can take courage from a testimony like that praise God I can certainly you don't come from the greatest place you don't come from the best family you don't come from the richest family God still has a calling for you praise God he still has a purpose for you he's given you great favor Hallelujah what's more favor to be able to call the president say Mr President can you do this or that or say dear Lord Jesus could you please minister to this need which is a greater blessing of course it's the praise of the Lord he's the closest friend we've ever had right the closest he's the best friend that will ever have he's the Lord Jesus Hallelujah am I wearing you out church I mean am I wearing everybody out tonight or I'm sorry this morning sorry let's take courage from testimonies like Mary let's take courage from testimonies like Jacobin she just trusts in the god she she overcame the fear that the government put on her like the government's going to kill my child she overcame that fear and put it in God's hands Hallelujah that's what the Bible said God honored her because she had trust in God like sister know we had a good testimony about trusting in God for uh Beatrice's expired passport maybe you'll share that after series or after service this year that's a good just trust God church we just got to trust God Amen how about Sarah I love this this testimony of Sarah both Abraham and Genesis 17 laughed at God God said Abraham I'm going to bless her and give thee a son also of her I'll bless her and she shall be the mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her then Abraham he just didn't like laugh like that the Bible said he fell on his face and laughed and said shall shall be born unto him that's a hundred years old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear can you imagine hearing a sermon and it's about you and you just fall down and laugh and say that could never happen how is that possible oh my goodness and he turned out to be the father of the faith see sometimes Church our weakness is there so God will bypass our weakness he'll expose our weakness to ourselves and then make us strong in other words he'll do the opposite of our weakness and make us strong in that area let's have confidence in God Amen trust God Amen he literally let your law on the ground happy oh I'm going to go in the Rapture like a little church like this and go all right oh my goodness church this this church a tiny little church like this is going to go around right for sure we're going to get a body change [Laughter] the promise of God amen God Amen someone's going to believe it praise God Hallelujah is that always to the rich churches it's not always to the the fancy churches and so all those who believe it's all those who are predestinated to God's will Hallelujah and I might as well believe I'm just as it was pretty as anybody else I wasn't born the message but God called me into it praise God hallelujah I'm just just as much as Freedom as anybody right and you can play you can place yourself in there as well all of you have left left Temptations and left trials and left situations I'm going on an hour and a half huh it's a normal Sunday morning okay I just know I looked up at the clock hadn't looked at this whole time Hallelujah each one of us have situations that don't look very good but in each one God comes in our situation and he says my grace is sufficient for you Hallelujah Hallelujah my strength just like Abraham God's strength was made perfect in Abraham's weakness praise God oh and then Sarah laughed when God visited her in Genesis 18. she overhears God talking to Abraham and she laughed within herself and said after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also how am I going to have magic God comes rebukes her she laughs at the promise of God church as a preacher I've had people literally laugh at my sermons how would that make you feel you study and pray all these days all these weeks hours and somebody laugh at your sermon like that's okay depends it depends who you're looking at for approval praise God I want to look at this for I don't look at my adoption certificate for approval yeah that's right I am adopted whoops I always do that thank God no the word of God fell out of here praise God I always want to remember that's right I was the Bible says I am a God of God I was predestinated to be adopted God already knew he was going to adopt me and I've got the certificate to prove it praise God I got the proof of the amen I got the scripture I can point somebody say look he predestinated me to this now some of us might not laugh at God's promise but how many get discouraged and complain about God's promise same thing same thing same thing well when is God going to show up when I'm already 90 years old when's God going to show up Sarah could have said if he had done it surely he would have done it earlier surely just like saying he said surely you'll not die surely God doesn't need us to interpret the word of God God just wants us to believe the word of God thank God the Lord said why did Sarah laugh wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I Surety bear a child when I'm old is there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I'll return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah tonight said I didn't laugh for she was afraid and she said nay but thou didst laugh laughed at God lied to God and then the beautiful part is once the baby comes in Genesis 21 Sarah said God hath made me to laugh right right because I've had a son so that all that here will laugh with me but it's a different kind of a laugh Hallelujah the other life was disbelieved like oh God you must who how does he even know what he's talking about he might not he must have forgot who he's talking to I'm a 90 year old woman but now she's laughing look what God has done look how God proves his word look how God is faithful to his promise I'm laughing in Joy now I'm going to name my son laughter I'm gonna name it Isaac because I laugh at how good God has been to me praise God Amen despite my unbelief Hallelujah despite my Laughing despite my lying amen despite all of our sins and what we do our mistakes despite our faults God's word will come to pass Hallelujah amen thank God am I helping anybody today by God's grace I heard a couple amens good that encourages me thank you thank God church and I just want to kind of bring this down here if I can by God's grace pardon me God has been forming you God or God informed you in your mother's womb I just want to think once you think about that it wasn't your mom that formed you it was God that formed you Psalm 22 verse 9 but Thou Art he that took me out of the womb so not your even your mom might not deliver you the doctor might have not delivered you God delivered you out of the womb how many believe that and it's make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts right I was cast upon thee from the womb Thou Art my God from my mother's belly here on Mother's Day let's go back to when we were little babies God made us hope right after we were born God's the one that allowed us to be born right Psalm 71 verse 4. deliver me oh my God out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man for thou art My Hope oh God now look he was he was hoping on his mother's uh chest and now he's hoping as a Man Too amen Hallelujah Thou Art he that took me out of my mother's bowels my praise shall be continually of Thee I am as a Wonder unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge to church you got to realize God is your hiding place this world is an awful place but God is our safety zone praise God just like God had you protecting your mother's womb the safest place for a baby is a mother's womb right that's the safest place and and so we're born we leave that safe place but Church the same God that was protecting us there is the same God that's protecting us now that we're out of the womb praise God Hallelujah so what do we got to do we got to praise him all the time he's my refuge verse eight let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honor all the day cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength failed anybody ever get tired he says don't he said don't cast me off when my strength fails for my enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together saying God hath forsaken him persecuted and take him for there is none deliver him oh God be not far from me oh my God make haste for my help now look the way to encourage yourself is remember God for me in my mother's womb God brought me out and God's still with me today praise God so many times David talks about this from my mother's womb in other words God was there before I even knew he was there amen come on he was there he's the one that formed me think about that you know if Sister C were here the Holy Ghost is forming the holy spirit is forming that baby right now the anointing of God is on her life forming that child right now doing July event told me the baby's doing July and God is the one for me and think about that God even does it in the sinner's lives too it's not the mom doing that it's God doing that Psalm 139 verse 1 to the chief musician a Psalm of David oh Lord thou has searched me and known to me oh Church the greatest thing is not that you know God but that God knows you let me prove that by the Bible Galatians 4 9 I'm sorry gonna have you jump over all but now after that year have known God or rather are known of God how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements where unto you desire again to be in bondage what did Jesus tell the workers of iniquity I never knew you but what is he going to tell us he says he knows us because we're his church where his bride we Let Jesus wash us with the Waters of the word service after service year after year we kept coming back and Jesus kept washing us making us pure making us white making us rise in the faith Hallelujah helping us rise we all don't learn everything the first week we come in the message do we no how about the first year we're in the message do we learn everything do we obey everything of course not how about the first decade we're in the message do we understand everything when we come we got everything figured out the first decade we're in the message absolutely not no he's still helping us Rise Above The Temptations and trials that come into our lives but the most important thing is that he knew you he predestinated you he adopted you into his family verse two Psalm 139 verse 2. God knows my down sitting now look everybody's all down sitting down nobody's standing up right now but God knew you'd be sitting right there God knows all about it he knows what you're thinking right now I don't know what you're thinking but God knows what you're thinking you're sitting down I'm standing he knows when you're going to rise next thou understand my thought afar off but some of you might be thinking way far off of the sermon right now he knows it he still loves you right well my thoughts are really far off brother bring him into subjection the word of God hallelujah take him captive the Bible says God knows all about it thou verse 3 thou Compass my path and my lying down aren't acquainted with all and now awesome and that encouraging when you lay down God's right there have a good rest brother Jess I'll be here right with you all night even if you start snoring your wife's gonna help you stop snoring stop snoring he's watching over me don't choke on your on your tongue yeah whatever for the snoring he says he's right there I confess you when you're lying down yeah one time Victoria got lost remember she was lying down in our yard and we're like where in the world is Victoria and God was right there compassed around Victoria and she just leave it right there on the line just have enjoying the Sun I said Thank You Jesus that you laid down with her hallelujah thank God because God knew her God knows you verse 4 for there is not a word in my tongue but oh Lord thou know I sit all together he knows what you're going to say and thank God he stops sometimes what we're going to say I like those amens I look I like those eight minutes too amen verse 5 thou has beset me behind and before God's got you on both sides and lay thy hand upon us he's around you on both sides and he's got his hand on you he just walk in you right right through your life he's walking right through the trials of your life I got you I'm gonna walk right with you this is this is God's promise David says this is God not only here but he for me in my mother's womb now how many how many feel you're highly favored now we're highly favored verse six such knowledge is too wonderful for me brother I can't even preach it so it's 200 how can I express it to the people will catch it then I'll catch it it is high I cannot attain to it I can't even begin to understand how God is all over my life verse 13. for thou has possess my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb that's a hedge fence protection God had a fence around you in your mother's womb I will praise thee for I'm fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance will not hit for me when I was made in secret and cursely wrought in the lower parts of the Earth I was reading there when I when a when an egg is fertilized over there's either 100 million to 250 million germs there and each one has different attributes one might have curly hair I didn't get that one that wasn't me something's got black hair brown hair blonde hair red hair there's a hundred million different attributes of a person but there's only one that makes it you were the one that made it that these certain attributes about you that's the that's the one that God first saw he said I knew brother amen is going to make it right there this is what he's going to look like this is what he's going to be like of all these possibilities brother Randolph said the natural birth is more mysterious than the Virgin birth in the Virgin birth God just come down and create the egg and The Germ put him together there's Jesus but with you and I right the mom has all these eggs right now of course there's a certain type of ovulation but the man has all these germs and there's a hundred million and only one brings forth a fertilization that produces what you are today praise God oh in other words God knew exactly what I was going to be he formed me exactly the way he wanted to be I'm fearfully wonderfully made this knowledge brother Austin is too great for me I can't contain it but what I can do is praise God hallelujah amen praise God I can't contain it and then he's around me all the time he formed me in my mother's womb he kept me healthy and he's been watching me all my whole life just protecting me this whole time walking with me he sees me when I lie down he wakes me up Hallelujah sometimes at 4am when I don't want to get up but he wakes me up anyway praise God to study and pray and hear the word of God but I know he's with me praise God I've got his favor you and I are highly favored Hallelujah hey man verse 60. thine eyes that see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them God had the whole book of your life all written out before you'd even come to this earth before there was even one of them God already had it figured out verse 17 how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I'm awake I am still with thee remember I showed you the sand of the sea remember I show you that illustration there's ten thousand grains of sand in one handful ten thousand and then David said all your thoughts about me are more than all the sand right that's hard to understand but do we believe that will that give us courage today when we go see our moms or we try to call our moms or whatever will that give us courage today God knew all about this day he set me up for my mother's womb for this day right every day every day but today he's with me he formed me he's with me he's going before me he's going he's behind me and His Hands All Over Me Hallelujah I want to read this here just briefly I'm gonna preach a little longer here but if you didn't notice somebody I wonder I've got this so oh yeah I heard sure just just take a moment just think about here's the first trimester of a fertilized egg and its development okay by week number yeah we fertilization fertilization happens in week three week four is implantation in week five the hormone levels increase in week six the neural tube closes for neurodevelopment first I'm sorry not verse seven in week seven the baby's head develops seventh week I think about that church throughout every week God is making sure that head develops the right way God made sure your head developed the right way he took that whole week he said I'm going to make sure Malachi's head looks just like his dad's because that's remember that's what his dad prayed for that's what the Bible says week eight the baby's nose form so he looked at my nose and he thought I want to make a nose just like Jesse's because there we go all right just the right nose God takes he said I'm going to take a whole week on that nose brother amen is that what the Bible says he for me he had all these things written in his book this is beautiful this is how much God loves me he took a whole week just on my nose apparently it took a week on just a week on creation itself right a natural week maybe Maybe right but he also took a whole week on your nose in week nine he worked on your toes I can see sister who is right there I saw my toes this morning brother Irvin saw my toes at foot washing last week and look I say look brother look God worked on these for a whole week look check these out here see this one is this this one's my favorite that big toe because without that I don't have any balance week nine is the baby's toes we uh 10 is the baby's elbows start bending oh see where I got that joint I'm gonna work a whole week a whole week on both of these joints I'm going to make sure they can bend you I'm with you week 11. reproductive parts develop he takes a whole week on reproductive parts week 12 and I think this is the end of the first trimester right party okay okay well Mayo Clinic stops at week 12. so I'm gonna trust my wife not Mayo Clinic or else I'll be in trouble no [Laughter] I'm just kidding we dropped week 12 God takes a whole week on your fingernails everybody look at your fingernails there a whole week he took on those I'm gonna form those and make them to grow I don't start eating them because I'm gonna take a whole week that's just the first trimester but there's three trimesters is that right how many believe the Bible is true now think think of all think of all the thoughts God had to have to make one fingernail let alone 10. and then the Bible says all these thoughts were so many is as it says the sand of the sea how many can say Amen to that I was thinking today praying I was like how did God actually form my nose like how did that how did that actually work how does he do that because I was thinking of the scripture and we can say I'm fearfully and wonderfully made let me close with this here there's many other verses that speak about the mother's womb John the Baptist had the anointing in his mind from the mother's womb look how God was given him special Grace amen I wish you would I wish I would have had it from the mother's womb but I'd come out lying and speaking evil things all kinds of bad things but that wasn't my testimony God had a special Testament but I thank God for that testimony Jesus said eunuchs are born from the womb some of them so that's a special anointing God forms them and gives them such a human Spirit where they don't need to get married they can just serve God no problem Galatians I'm sorry Acts 3 2 and acts 14 8 says these two men one were both one was lame one was blind I believe they were born that way from the womb well that gives us another picture it seems like it seems like to The World God made a mistake but church God doesn't make any mistakes knew about that disability God knew about that paralyzed condition God knew about the blindness and by God's grace he healed them on this side he left something undone over here in the womb in order to manifest his power on this side Hallelujah but he knew all of it from the mother's womb and then he told Jeremiah I knew you before I formed you thank God Amen I knew you before the womb praise God because brother Graham said remember we come he said we Jesus came the regular line from attribute in the mind of God to theophany flesh glorified body but these two switch for All Humans we we start from the attribute of God then we go to flesh to be tested and then after flesh after we die we get a glorified body oh hallelujah amen at the rapture we get a glorified body Hallelujah attribute flesh the odd body hallelujah thank God and lastly Paul said I was called from my mother's womb to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ let's stand to our feet Church what musicians can come what were you called to do from the mother's womb Jesus cares so much for us as we've seen in the natural development if he cares so much for us in the our natural development what about our Spiritual Development if he took a week on my fingernails he's probably gonna need more time on that to overcome my pride how about my selfishness how long is that going to take or he really works he's really got to work and form it and change things how long is that going to take but I can be confident that very God who formed the natural helped me develop naturally and mature the same God will help me develop spiritually because that's really the more important part how many believe that by God's grace the Bible says Philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ and Jesus said teaching them to observe all things whatsoever command and use now listen to church we're all trying to obey all things right we're all in the process of learning to obey all things Jesus said none of us can say I've obeyed all things today brother Jesse nobody can say that but I love this part and lo I'm with you alway even unto the end of the world amen let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer I didn't really know how this was going to turn out I'm just as surprised if anyone I really am humbled In God's Presence too because I love Jesus I'm thankful that he gave me this life thankful he adopted me into his family I didn't deserve it as we see here in the scripture no one deserves it we'll get to it maybe so Romans 3 says all have fallen short in the way of God there's none that doeth righteous not one and to think he took a week just to focus on my nose it took a week just to make sure that my elbow bends the right way then I'll complain if I get up like I said [Music] by God's grace let's be thankful today that we're fearfully and wonderfully made [Music] you are highly favored Church friends my brothers and sisters who are highly favored today he's made you accepted in the Beloved in heaven in the heart of Heaven
