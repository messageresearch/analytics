========================================

got it maybe otherwise but we took time took some time to sit at jesus and the things that were given to us they won't be taken from us so joshua 13 i have some slides here saints just a few slides here i'll try to keep it uh brief tonight but either way we're gathering together more it's a joy to see each one of you god richly bless you and we surely love you with the love of the lord by god's grace so uh hanging with me for a little bit longer here so i mean maybe i'll only preach hour tonight we'll see here let me just let me say the hour timer okay uh i don't i don't want to wear my voice out either but um welcome to august though by god's grace welcome to august it's good it's hard to believe it's the eighth month already eighth month we're almost done with this year right two thirds done with your hard to believe so let's look at this thought of taking the whole land now just i'm just bringing this from last week remember church we are just like joshua we have we have battles within the land and without the land okay now they had it within the land because they still had heathens in the land and then they had to guard their borders right they had outside enemies but for us it's a little different we have battles inside of our bodies and outside of our bodies like with you know with people that persecute us or people that mock us or make fun of us or you know belittle us or something like that because paul said without i had fightings and within he had fears now i don't know what kind of fightings these were saints but look he had to fight off robbers now can you imagine that god let his prophet be rubbed was it was he still loving oh absolutely was he sometimes god let him be robbed did he have perils and waters did he have trouble on the seas yeah he did yet he's the prophet of god church age messenger a star in the hand of jesus right i'm sorry without trouble i'm talking about so he had robbers he was he had to constantly worry about getting stolen from he had problems traveling shipwrecks right troubles with heathen people heathen gentiles perils in the city right trouble in the city perils in the wilderness perils in the sea perils among false brethren it looked like church every place he turned he had trouble outside but then inside he's still battling fear that's why he said pray for me that i'll have boldness see because he was just like you and i right that's right now you might have a minor prophetic gift and that'd be great that'd be wonderful to help the body of christ but here he had trouble on every side but yet he was fearful on the inside am i going to get robbed today so church don't feel bad if you worry about am i going to get covenant am i going to get the delta variant right i got the first covenant well i might get the delta variant too that's a fear that we may have inside but it's common that's human nature but we got to battle that fear off by god's grace praise god got to battle that fear off the inside fears and then we have these outside battles too so see how it's so similar it is so similar to joshua they had inside battles within right and then they had battled without and so we can benefit from joshua by looking at that and seeing how god was faithful god kept his word praise god god always backed up his word to joshua amen i just thought of a different scripture let me see if i can find it real quick this just came to my mind and usually i'll stop if something seemed like i could be a help to the people i thought it was a last verse but maybe not maybe i'm okay i think i must be thinking of a different oh no there it is okay yeah go to uh let's skip ahead real quick go to joshua21 i heard it this this good scripture look at this yeah wow great joshua 2144 look at that my take courage church take courage let's take courage from joshua that as he had he had a trust in god in every battle he had to trust in god church every battle he trusted in god and every battle he eventually was victorious so will you be you you're gonna have you and i are gonna have lots of battles in fact history says it took him seven or eight years to defeat those 31 kings it just didn't all happen in like two months it was just bad here take a few months off battle there a couple months off battle battle that's how it is for us we have a battle we'll get out of battle praise god just enjoy some seasons of rest then we're back in another battle praise god but if we just stay faithful we just obey the voice of the lord god will make us conquerors look at verse 44 this is beautiful and the lord gave them rest round about so the lord gave them battles first brother bang 31 kings worth of battles and then he gave him rest amen see god's going to give you battles then he's going to give you rest according to all that he swear to their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them uh i don't have this up on the screen sorry the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand look aw so anyone that was willing to fight the battles is willing to stand there and god would give you the victory as long as you're willing to face that enemy and say devil i'm going to stand up i'm going to cower to you i'm going to stand up to you in the mighty name of jesus as long as god made a victory look at this look at verse 45 there failed not ought any of good thing with which the lord had spoken unto the house of israel all came to pass think about that testimony church if we live to die like if we in a real session or procession i hope somebody says every promise god made to jesse it was fulfilled praise god that's what i want my testimony to be if if i live and the rapture is after my lifetime i want to have that testimony and before i die i want to tell everybody i look my children to eye and say everything god promised to me he brought it to pass amen and every man that stood before me every demon that stood before me i overcame it by the blood of christ and the word of my testimony see this is what they had the natural by animal blood what about us in the spiritual with the son of god holy blood amen what about that church see we see we can be happy the priests come praise god we may not see it now but the victory's on the way amen and this becomes more and more real the longer we're christians right because this person will come that person will come these battles are coming up and as long as we stand there with the word of god we know we're going to get the victory we might have fears within we definitely got battles without praising but as long as we got christ within we know the victory's on the way now as i said this morning i want to stir you up again remember church every place or every blessing is ours if we'll fight for it just real quickly remember every place that your feet goes you'll have because paul said he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings every every ev everything you want to conquer church you can conquer in jesus name anything anything you want to see god give you the victory over it's yours just believe it praise god if it's a spiritual blessing and peter said he's given all given gift given all things that pertain unto life oh in my life i really could use this well it's given to you in my life i could use some godliness right it's given to you how do you get it though by promises right by promises you're a partaker so in other words lord you gave me the promise of peace you gave me the promise of victory you gave me the promise of forgiveness you give me the promise of the gifts of the holy spirit i know you're going to bring it to pass thank you for the promise i'm going to keep confessing it until i see it come to pass in my life we partake of all these blessings by believing the promise like abraham for 25 years believe god's going to give me a seed god's going to give me a child and sometimes he questioned him but the bible said he staggered not at the promise of god amen but he was strong in faith giving god the glory we ought to give glory tonight if there's a promise you want from god but you don't have it yet but you know it's coming you ought to give god glory i didn't know you glory that's right we must be strong in faith giving god the glory and didn't paul say if he spared not his son his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall need he not also with him freely give us all things now all things that pertain to our walk with god right because a sister's walk is gonna look a lot different than a brother's walk right so anything that pertains to a sister's walk you can have it all sisters brothers anything that pertains to a walk for the brothers you can have all of it and you will have all of it if you're a real holy ghost-filled christian you will have all of it praise god now look here's another one i just read this yesterday i'm like oh i got to add this one in there as sorrowful yet rejoicing as poor yet making many rich these were poor preachers but they made people spiritually rich having nothing and yet possessing all oh man paul's like give me that coat make sure you bring my one coat i don't have any i have no other coats so he had nothing but yet he said he had everything because he said i can do all things through christ who strengthens me see the presence of jesus christ the peace of jesus christ the love of jesus christ uh the mercy of christ if he had he had it all so church what's stopping you what's stopping me from possessing any spiritual blessing just time right just time and unbelief we gotta kick out on the belief and give god glory while we're waiting for the blessing to come so think about that church what blessing do you want your life just keep trusting god for it just keep saying i'm just like joshua every place where i put my foot yeah i'm going to get the victory in that that's going to be my possession okay so i just want to stir your minds up again i'll stir you up i'm going to boil you up praise god turn up the heat there now i'm not going to preach this whole chapter because uh i only found i really only found inspiration in maybe a couple of verses okay as far as like things that i thought would be a benefit to us right for reading just like this morning i had like 60 quotes well i only read a couple of them right you know you can't read all of them but uh you can't i can't read all these verses right but i can give you the outline and then kind of preach what i felt inspired to preach now the outline is there's much land to be possessed uh by the nine and a half tribes because remember two and a half tribes already got their land on the uh east side of jordan right so verses one to seven is what we'll focus on now verses eight to twelve uh god talks about the land east of jordan given to the reubenites and gadites and then in verse 13 estranged he just puts he says there's two heathen groups dwelling in the land in that land still and then verse 14 and 31 said levites inherit nothing they just inherit the lord that's a beautiful type there hallelujah that's a beautiful type of us right who who's our portion god's our portion amen jesus is our portion let the celebrities go rent their uh their speed boats and go have their their boat their boat party that's fine just give me jesus let them have their movie theaters and their showings and and their private security just let me have the angel of the lord right here but the bible said the angel lord encompass all those that fear the lord and he will deliver us amen psalm 34 7 praise god let me have that let me have that escort by god's grace oh hallelujah the rumor knights their inheritance gaddites and then the half tribe of half tribe of manasseh rather now verse 1 we read this for our text verse one i'm getting i want to get to reward so brother again brother william's been inspiring me a lot lately but uh last sunday when i was driving to get the chipotle he was commenting on our sermon the sermon i preached last sunday and he says that was a beautiful thought about how joshua possessed all the promises but everybody else had a work to do he said brother branham had a ministry but we have a ministry too you remember that brother i thought beautiful thought i never even thought about it like that uh i thought wow that's right the prophet went in first and he did everything but then there was he died joshua died but then there were still believers that needed to possess their their inheritance praise god so the prophet was faithful with his he did everything he was supposed to do right the holy spirit said a huge portion of heaven awaits you right because you've chosen the harder way the narrow way you've chosen my way so a huge portion of heaven awaits him but joshua died and so now the other tribes have to learn to lean on the lord like joshua they have the same faith as joshua right and know that god's with them the same god that was with joshua is with us today amen the god of brother burnham is here today praise god amen he's the same yesterday today and forever and church that that's that's the great revelation like that's the great revelation is jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise god so in other words we got to recognize christ today and see how christ is dealing with us today right and receive his help today receive his strength right and then overcome today hallelujah right because we know what happened in the past we don't know what's going to happen in the future but one thing we can do is overcome today hallelujah so verse one this this it's it's a funny kind of verse to me so joshua's old and stricken stricken means like you're uh you're just kind of uh you're given to it but it's it's not like a good thing it kind of looks like a bad thing right and so then the lord the lord tells josh joshua you're old and stricken in years so it's kind of like you're you're you're burdened with all these uh all the hard parts are getting old right you're burdened with being old and there remaineth yet much land to be possessed verse two this is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the philistines and of jeshura from sihor which is before egypt even unto the borders of accra northward which is counted to the canaanite and so forth so god shows joshua all these boundaries okay philistines here canaanites here i'm just kind of you know throwing them out there right so joshua kept all the commandments god to him but god told him there's so much more people need to do praise god amen just like revelation 10 eat the book and go prophesy before many nations peoples kindreds take it right it's got to be taken around the world praise god so see the the first preacher does his work but then the rest of us must do our job as well amen see very much land remain to be possessed but joshua did all of it so here back to verse 23 of chapter 11. this is where i got my title joshua took the whole land see taking the land taking the whole land see according to all that the lord had said unto moses and joshua gave it for inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by the tribes and the land rested from war so see church that's the beautiful thing we don't have to do everything but we got to do what god has called us to do right and it really opened up to me yesterday i this just was a fresh revelation the remainder of these chapters deal with like all the borders and and where everybody it defines all their limits and their borders i thought my isn't that it wasn't an easy thing like it was a very detailed because there's mountains there's valleys there's hills and i thought wow that's just like the new testament how god will define he'll define a pastor is a little different than an evangelist an event just a little different from a song leader say like that and the gift of faith is a little different than the anointing of faith right it's all these details but they're so important so you know exactly where you stand with god amen like a deacon has a special his qualifications are a little different right it's unique it's not like just a simple cookie cut for everybody somebody preaching on that coming up by god's grace you know mothers have a certain role but then church mother [Music] mother can teach younger mothers right her younger mothers could go sister beatrice and ask her questions i hate to call her out we love mr beatrice if our if our young mothers you know uh if they have questions the bible said the elderly sister teach the younger sisters that doesn't seem like a cookie cutter well women shouldn't preach and women should but that doesn't mean another woman can't teach another woman not not behind the pulpit but just in fellowship right but it's so specific it's so unique and all of these borders were so unique it wasn't a simple cookie cutter one fits all kind of thing right it was all unique but joshua did everything god called him to do in church that's what we you you and i can't answer for anybody else but one thing we can do is lord help me to do all that you want me to do right we are let me tell you like this we're one church we're one tiny church with uh just a handful of tithe players which we're all grateful for we can't change the world necessarily but we can do great things where god has called us to do it we cannot build like physical churches like we can't write a check for a 50 000 and go build a church in south africa or something like that or you know wherever they need it you know london or whatever we can't do that but we can do what god has called us to do and a big church can't do what we can do praise god now what that is is to be revealed by the holy ghost like we're talking about going to denominational churches and trying to be a witness well the big churches won't do that right they've got bigger things to do well we've got things to do too now to us they're big right we want we want to possess our land that's important to us praise god so we must recognize we must find out what god has called us to and then we must ask god to give us grace to do it because you're going to see that with caleb too they knew what god was called them to do but then they had to ask for certain things too in other words we got to ask god for wisdom praise god amen all right so yeah now this isn't very good can i zoom in on this yeah sorry that bummer uh yeah i can't zoom into that but anyways here's jordan here's jordan uh there's shiloh where's someone's we've been preaching on they didn't put them on here oh there's ai okay yeah there's a and gibeon okay there's jericho okay so joshua was basically told to get all this red right now is this interesting joshua got about a third of the land it looks like maybe a third i thought that's interesting kind of reminds me of the three parts of man like god gave us billy oh we have total victory in the song but the message we gotta fight for i don't know that was i thought that was kind of funny it just looks like a third to me right okay so syria they didn't get all syria galilee other parts here philistines we remember that right remember that in our text right so remember god told joshua you have a lot more to go as far as the people you've done all you had to do but there's a lot more land left to be taken look there's a lot more victories to be won so see church when we get the holy ghost you would think oh it's all done it's all finished no there's a lot to do praise god there's a lot of old habits to clean out amen there's a lot of thinking you've got to be removed from your thinking right there's a lot there's a lot more things i can review to you if you'll keep fighting the good fight of faith see a lot of people though don't want to fight right they don't want to fight they don't want to keep pressing in and and hungering and thirsting for righteousness like they want to denominate right we've seen people denominate like people that bend the message so they can dominate after a year they can denominate after five years they can denominate after 10 years and say this is all god's going to reveal nothing else church god forbid we should ever do that may we have an open heart and say god keep revealing more of yourself to us you're an eternal being there must be more revelation for us amen see we can never denominate and become a message denomination because we'll die right there that's why we've got to keep praying for souls to be born like our young children they've got to have the baptism of the holy ghost mj's got to get it right remember when you guys got it that was glorious time and we got to keep labor until everybody gets that amen see a church that's not bringing forth is dying amen so we have to constantly have those acts 2 38 youngins amen the first uh the belief back on the day of pentecost amen see we're always going to be uh i always got a father leading a hold up back to the baptism of the holy ghost right because we've got to constantly be bringing forth it never gets old remember when can preacher last year wouldn't preach on the holy s and the pomegranates it felt like a brand new sermon yet we've heard sermon after sermon on the holy ghost right you would think it would just get oh but it never gets old it's always fresh because it's eternal praise god it's the presence of god and never you can never get used to it amen you can brother i say you can never get used to it's too holy it's too sacred praise god it's always just that uh shekinah glory of god that holiness of jesus christ oh it's heaven to us that's why i don't matter that's the thing just don't get it don't don't get discouraged just keep coming one of these days is gonna be your days it's gonna be your day praise god it's gonna be the day of your prayers answered praise god now i brought this out now a few years ago four years ago i preached on the types of the seven heathens joshua drove out and i used i understood the types because i used their hebrew definitions or their occupations so remember god told joshua here's the seven canaanites hittites hivites perizzites gergescites amorites and jebusites so i don't hear you weren't here brother uh william when i preached this a while back but i'm going to just bring it real briefly i started studying the names of these uh peoples and i was really shocked i'm like these sound like battles i'm fighting so for example canaanite the word canaanite means a traitor or merchant and that made me think of the love of money so when we get in the promised land we got to drive out the merchant right the the love of money right brother brahms said remember brother bam said out of women popularity money his greatest battle was money so he said that's why i won't call an offering that's why i'll only take a hundred dollars a month right as a as a church pastor housing allowance they call it and brother look i looked up hittites hittite means a son of hef and hath means terror a son of fear i thought i battle fear all the time i just showed you how paul battled fears he was a holy ghost-filled saint i thought what a beautiful type now i'm not saying this is i'll say the lord but it's really spiritual even though you're born again you're still gonna have to battle money right still gotta battle the love of money don't love it love god right but if you're rich in this world make sure you're always ready to give to people and that should be most of us most of us if we have a little bit of savings in the bank account we're rich and so we must always be ready to give to those that need it not everything they want just give them a little bit right like don't give up all your money right then you can't feed your kids and everything but give them a little bit so hivites now this one had to use their bible definition not not the group not the hebrew word okay so hivites are like compromising with the world because most of the hivites were gibeonites and joshua made the league with the gibby knights so in other words that should have taught him don't compromise in the promised land so in other words we're about a compromise to speak with the world well it's okay just to do a little bit of willingness it's okay to have a little bit of world leaders in life no don't make any league with it don't make any don't make any promises all right hallelujah so see that's when we battle compromising parasites the parasites were former so i had to take that earthy and the bible says we were earthy right so earthy means you're carnal so this one i had to use this one's kind of a stretch right but uh farmers earth you know land earthy carnal so i just thought that was maybe that's probably the hardest one that maybe doesn't really fit perizzites but this one's beautiful gurgashite means clay brother and in daniel 2 the iron and clay mix brother brahm said the iron was the catholic church and the clay was the protestant that means clay is denominational protestants and we have to battle denominational spirits do we not i'm sure you've seen it over the years people want to denominate on their revelation or denominate in their church and not fellowship with other people peter had the battle of that right with the the gentiles so see we gotta we gotta drive that out in the name of jesus how many how many believe it can be done amen all these all these god gave in to joshua's hand and joshua succeeded in driving them all out praise god not a one of these stood in joshua's way that's so beautiful amorites now amrit they were giant hill men so they lived up in the mountains right so this reminded me of giant battles right speak to the mountain it'll move so i just call this giant fleshly luster just just giant mountains you have to face in life right so the amorites represent mountains that have to be moved even though you're born again there's mountains in your life and you need to speak the word of god to the mountain and tell it to move amen praise god we all got to do it right we all got to speak like media's tumor meet his tumor was a mountain and the holy spirit said whatever you say it'll happen in other words speak to the mountain and the mountain will have to obey you and brother said before the doctor can touch it the two feet to the mountain it'll move now this last one is beautiful too yes this was to me jebusite means son of jabus which means a stronghold stronghold is a complex right and paul said paul said the word of god pulls down strongholds and what was brother ramsey's last battle before he went off the scene the complex of not loving the people remember his complex in uh standing in the gap the last battle he fought as far as spiritual battle now not not the not the squirrel that was a physical battle right the last spiritual battle he fought was the complex before he went off the scene he wanted to move up in the mountains with meda and just he said stomp down the mountain whenever he had thus saith the lord preach it and then walk back up he said because he said every year he goes back to the same churches they keep cutting their hair wearing makeup and the men keep compromising enjoying denominations he said it gets worse every year and he said if they don't want to hear me they don't have to hear me then that's just what the devil wanted but the holy spirit had to say he had to give him a vision and say if you do that you'll turn into a bum and media will leave you he said the angel said you're not an old testament prophet you have apostolic gifts in other words the new testament prophet doesn't run from the people he runs to the people praise god so see church now if i'm honest with myself and i'm sure william and all the brothers will be too we battle all these right we battle complexes fleshy lusts that are giant things denominational carnal compromising fear the love of money these are all things we battle and this was a great this was a great help to me a few years ago because i thought i'm in the promised land what here's what i'm fighting right all right there you go how do we do it we got to cast it in other words don't give out it right cast down any imagination exalts itself against the word of god bring that thought into captivity bring it into prison and lock it up right lock it up and the bible says revenge or disobedience in other words have a zeal this time i'm not going to disobey this time i'm going to be kind this time i'm not going to shut up my bowels of compassion my poor brother this time i'm going to help him out this time i'm not going to that spirit or lust this time i'm going to overcome by the grace of god see see that that's when we've really repented that's what happens now we have a zeal to do what's right next time praise the lord because we're fighters we're warriors we're new testament soldiers praise god we got the full armor of god on praise god now getting back to verse one now look joshua fulfilled all the will of god for his ministry like david and caleb now here we see the type of the three kinds of rewards and here's a fresh thought that came to me recently there's three levels of rewards for christians that are holy ghost filled and i'm going to show a chart on this in a minute 100 fold 60 fold 30-fold now look david even though he stumbled in that one spot with bathsheba and uriah the bible says he fulfilled all the other will of god now look at that can you imagine church like i said you're about ready to die but you can die with peace knowing i did everything god wanted me to do that would make me so happy right that would make that make you want to shout even though you're dying you'd want to shout and say thank god god help me do everything he called me to do i'm not in other words i'm not leaving anything undone like we saw last week josh didn't leave anything undone right what a peace david must have had in his heart lord i fulfilled all of it i got all these items stored up so the next generation can build the house of god he was living for the next generation praise god he was planting seeds for the next generation many of us are doing that right we're pouring into the next generation that's to come maybe we won't see the fulfillment of what we want to see but maybe the next generation will amen beautiful david fulfilled all the will of god for his generation and what was what was the will of god serving his generation church god's will for you and i will always be to serve one another how can i serve brother vang how can i serve by the amen and sister how can i serve the saints right your your will or god's will for your life your land is going to be service right not self-promotion i didn't say self-promotion i said service service who can i serve at the church right so he did all the serving of god just all serving that god won't do for his generation jesus said i didn't call me served he said but i give him a lot of cows make lords over each other you serve me used to me he said but with you it won't be so with real holy ghost the greatest among you will be the servants see see how much you can serve people you don't have to be with money don't have to do with books you don't want to be within it can be just with prayers what is really most important in this life church the longer we live the more the more we know the most important thing is our prayer life amen that's really the best way to serve people pray for them and then find a way to help them out praise god and look at joshua oh i'm sorry look at caleb caleb they say this about caleb like three or four times in the bible he's known as a man who wholly followed the lord god of israel that's how he's known you say caleb oh he's a strong he was a strong old man he stayed strong in his old age just as he was when he was younger and he did everything the lord do his whole heart was about following the lord how many want them to say that about you praise god jesse wholly followed the lord in all that the lord told them to do oh my that's what i want people to say but it's going to take sacrifice it's going to take some battles praise god it's going to take some fights with the sword of the word amen to wholly do the will of god for your life there are some beautiful thoughts that we're going to get to i think we had a couple more sermons on this this chapter this book rather there are some beautiful thoughts coming up i'm telling you just hold on there are some powerful thoughts like what i was sharing earlier about the the different qualifications in other words the land you and i are supposed to possess not everybody's land looks the same right it's not all the same but everybody has land and everybody has to overcome in that land and you've got to do it don't look to anybody else you look to do it you be the warrior you be the prayer warrior you be the fighter praise god it's wonderful brother amen saying about god is better and i had all these better scriptures in here samuel told saul to obey is better than sacrifice because rebellion is the same as witchcraft and because saul rejected the word lord god rejected him from being king so see saul rejected obeying david obeyed for the most part right other than a few things and look remember again we can possess all of our promises because paul said he finished his course in other words saul didn't saul didn't finish his course samuel said david is better than you saul look at that samuel said the lord hath read the kingdom of israel from this this day yet he was going to be king for many more years but samuel said god's already ripped it out of your hands even though you're going to be king for numerous more years and if given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou well i had a spell for the william the first time i preached i thought my hallelujah the holy ghost says i'm a better obeyer than denominations amen i'm not the one saying that god said that amen i'm better at obeying oh my they can smoke and drink and cuss and fornicate in adultery and do all that but god looks at our life and say you're better at obeying than those creeds hallelujah those churches with the mother harlot and the daughters god said i'm better i didn't say it i'm just repeating it church not a prideful way but you are better at obeying the voice of the lord than denominations let's thank the lord for that praise god hallelujah it's bible facts brother branham says david obeyed better than saul so god took down saul and raised up david god has taken down denominations hallelujah and he's raised up the bride like we felt this morning amen he's raised us up in heavenly places as the real queen of the earth the real bride of jesus christ the real kings and queens are kings and priests unto god on this earth oh hallelujah i said i showed on wednesday night remember wednesday night uh i cut it off so i'm sorry but i showed i preached on the trinity right how it's evil it's of satan and i showed how joe biden is a trinitarian he's also a liar he's also an adulterer he's also an idolater he's also a rapist he's all these things i said that is the that is the culmination of just accepting the trinity because the bible says like a little eleven and then it leavens the whole lump i said look look what a denomination produces it produces a liar like that but the holy ghost should produce the opposite someone who's filled not with leaven but someone who's filled with god amen someone who's filled with unleavened bread someone who's uh filled with sincerity and truth that's what it produces in our life right i said the same thing about trump he's an adulterer he sometimes he lies right sometimes he he cusses he's a curser he's a presbyterian so he believes in three persons he may be under the same condemnation i don't know it's between them and god but we have no excuse we've seen a prophet we've seen the son of man we've seen the last sign we've heard the word of god we have no excuse we should be overcomers amen we're better than that right right better resources better everything better preach get better everything because we obey the promises of god we obey the word of god we're not in the witchcraft we're into holy ghost power hallelujah that's right church so god said there's a kind that's better to fulfill all the will of god for their lives are better than those who just fulfill some of it in church we can all possess the promises because paul now i put the greek words in there he said i have fought a good which is an excellent or honest or magnificent fight i fought an honest fight i didn't cheat i fought a magnificent fight robbers right shipwrecked whips terrors false brethren i fought against all these things on the inside he's dying he's afraid you know he's asking for the fire of god to take over but yet on the outside he's using his words to fight against all these all these adversaries taking the land by the power of christ spiritual land amen hallelujah he said i fought an excellent fight i finished i fulfilled i've accomplished i've executed my course just like joshua i've done everything the lord called me to do everything he placed in there i've done it when he asked me to do this i went to ephesus done i went to colas done i went to thessalonica done i went to rome done he could cross off everything i've done the will of god and i know there's a crown of righteousness waiting for me praise god i've done everything he's called me to do i possess all the land amen i trust on my on my to-do list brother amen was write the modesty book write the 12 mysteries book i wonder what's next but i would do whatever the lord puts on my list i want to do that for the glory of god like i said if it just helps one person it was worth it because my mind was not in the things of the world it was meditating on the things of god he says i have kept i have attended to the faith i have guarded the faith i have observed the faith i finished the course henceforth there's a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me it that day not to be only but all those that love the rapture oh glory so see paul is saying the same thing joshua said joshua said i took the whole land because god gave it to me i kept everything moses told me do i did it everything the holy ghost told paul to do he did it everything the holy ghost has told us to do let's do it praise god now here's a fresh revelation that came to me this came to me while i was writing the next book about family now this is quite a chart so i don't want to overwhelm you but just bear with me here get your bibles ready would you church i found there are three levels of rewards for the wise virgins here's wise version one two three i'm foolish here's f so here's foolish foolish legislation with no fruit and no real no no real reward in heaven and that's what ma'am says in the church book the foolish virgin doesn't inherit anything he said they're not the brethren he said they're just inheritors of eternal life that's the church age book so the first level of this reward is just really no reward other than eternal life now church look at this i have three i have three sections of scripture that say there's three levels of rewards now this is a fresh revelation to me i'm pretty sure only missionaries can reach this level brother william because jesus christ said so i think it's right there let's go let's go to mark 10. i'm pretty sure only missionaries like paul can reach that top level of reward because of what christ himself said mark 10 28. can somebody read that lydia malcolm get your bibles ready help me out here please mark 10 28. mark 10 28 malachi can you read 28 29 and 30. yeah 30. yeah 28 29 30. then please began to say unto him what we have left on and followed me when jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that has left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or land for my amen who gets 100 hundredfold the man that leaves his family in houses in other in order to preach the gospel go to uh lydia matthew 13 23. can you read that lydia matthew 13 23. now here we see the same thing now we're going to hear the jesus says there's a hundredfold there's a 60 fold there's a 30 fold so lydia matthew 13 23. and the church dead this was beautiful to me now we know that their what levels are going to look like in heaven there's going to be some notice some get a hundred fold those would be the missionaries these are these will be all brothers like the mission like the twelve discipline because they're giving the the they're giving the seats right next to jesus in revelation now here's where sisters and brothers i believe could do level the second and third levels they could do 60 or 30. right okay now go to uh john 15. john 15. let me show you these three levels again and we don't need to we don't we don't need to read the other ones but remember jesus said some get five talents some get two some get one right three why are there three levels because three is perfection right i mean it's a it's a perfect design whenever you design something you put three parts to it right father son holy ghost uh blood water spirit right there's always no water yeah the three phases of the earth goes through there's always three faith hope and charity like there's always three three is the perfect way to design something so god designs rewards on three levels missionaries get the highest reward and then brothers sisters if they're faithful with their gifts would be in here with three and two i'm sorry levels three and two so yeah john 15 here and i have verses 2 and 5. john 15 2 and 5. now keep joshua in mind why am i sharing this because joshua did it all joshua conquered all so what level joshua would have got he would have got the highest reward right but a little bit last week with and gaza there's some people that some tribes that drove out a lot but they didn't drive out everything and see that's how we have with rewards some people will drive out everything get the complete victory other people will drive out a lot they'll get a good they'll get a good reward but not the highest reward all right john 15 2 every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that bear fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit okay so in verse two you have fruit right and then you have more fruit in verse five i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing so in verse 2 you have fruit then you have more fruit and then you have much fruit hallelujah i mean church i'm just reading the scripture and this is what comes to me nobody taught me this it just came to me okay and then all these scriptures now here's the next one this this may be clear right this may be a little bit easier so these yellow ones are wise virgin and this is foolish virgin the wise highest reward hundred fold much fruit five talents they turn five tenths into ten the middle reward to sixty-four more fruit two talents into four and the smallest reward for the wise version thirty-fold you have fruit and you turn one talent into two now i'm probably right there i probably got one talent but i'm gonna be faithful with that one talent praise god i'm gonna preach my heart out brother until my vocal cords just snap or something like that i'm gonna i'm gonna write everything i can do teach everybody i can teach preach i'll pray for all the sick i can i'll give every i'll pour all myself into it and hope that i get a one-fold reward i hope i can double what god's given to me oh hallelujah after 15 years i hope i produce something for the kingdom of god hallelujah but church all these scriptures say people have salvation but no reward so let's read those go to first corinthians 3 8. now a little bit of this is review but is it help is it helpful to see that this was brand this was so fresh to me i like i gotta share this with the church i was just waiting for the right time and it seemed to tie out tie in right here with joshua because he possessed everything but other people didn't they didn't do as much right and here we see some people didn't have as much some people didn't do as much some people weren't as fruitful as others so we want to be fruitful now this is not on the topic church but i have scripture i can show how paul had almost all nine gifts of the holy spirit by history i can show paul had all give all five gifts of the fightful ministry brotherham said he was the first pastor in ephesus he's a prophet he foretold the rapture he's evangelist because he said let's go visit our brethren and see how they do let's go on that evangelistic circuit right he was a missionary an apostle and he was a teacher to the gentiles he had all five but there was a time in season for all the gifts so church that may be how you are like i told amen and bang i said god may call them to the pulpit someday you never know there's a time and season for all things god didn't deal with abraham's it was at 75. god didn't actually get a hold of moses until he was 80. i'm not talking about you brothers i'm preaching in 80 but i'm just saying like there's times and seasons where god needs a servant and he's look the bible said as i search the whole earth i need a servant i need a servant who will serve me who will call out against the evil simon showed that verse and so as long as he can find one man he can do something with that one man so in other words we want to be ready if he does call us because paul's ministry changed brother graham said you can't mix them but look paul had all five i just proved i can prove it to you by scripture so that means he wasn't mixing them he was one at a time pastor now other times he was a teacher other time he would sit under the pastors and just teach right he'd evangelize he'd prophesy so see church god see there's all these details there's all these unique details in the land amen praise god it's sad it's sad people don't have this understanding by the way because i i've asked pastors to come here and preach and they say brother man said you can't mix the ministries but look at paul he found a season to be a evangelist why can't a pastor find a season to be an evangelist just for like one week one week that's a short season right and then the brother was like all defeated like when i talked to him he was all he passed away last year but he was so defeated all the time like i'm the david and saul's person cute me all the time he just lived the defeat of life and i felt like he was like caught up into these denominational thoughts rather than seeing the beauty and the uniqueness of the christian land in the new testament let's not live a defeated life let's be more than conquerors in christ jesus so you gotta yes you have quotes but you gotta take other quotes yes you have quotes but you gotta take them back to the scripture see that i could take a whole sermon on paul's five gifts maybe i'll do that sometime you'll keep pulling it out of me that guy over there he's he'll say something i'll be like that was holy ghost right there brother okay first corinthians 3 8. now he that planted the he that water through one and every man should receive his own reward according to his own labor so see we've got labor for the people we've got to serve other people 14 if any man's work abide which he hath built upon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer lost he lost a reward but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire so someone can have a big reward they build up but if if it isn't a real genuine act it can all be burnt and washed away like lot he had all those family members but see how his wife his reward of his wife was washed away part of our reward is inheriting our families how many children did a lot have died in there he had some at least son-in-laws die in sodom he lost it was purified by fire right it was proven by fire the fires that fell he lost some of his reward because he didn't live he should have lived separated like abraham he should remember the promised son but man said he forgot about isaac he forgot about jesus he forgot about the promised son the rapture praise god may god help us always remember the rapture the coming of the lord second john 1 8 please this is to me this is sweeter than the honey on the comb god's word god's word is so sweet to me oh my goodness i i feel like i understand it better and better all the time and it's not by just quotes quotes are good it's by scripture i have quotes for all these right i can pull a quote oh there's four crosses i can pull a quote for all these things the version losing their reward i can pull quotes that brother bram said they don't inherit anything but life i have quotes for all these but to see in scripture that's where it really gets rock solid that's where your foundation is really solid because now you've got the quotes are great but we've got to have a scripture to back it up ii john 1 8 look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought or labored for but that we receive a there it is full reward to get a full reward you got to be fully faithful you got to fulfill every promise of god that god has given to you not to other people just to you that's why it's so important to have a relationship with christ lord show me what to do next what's my ministry what am i supposed to do now this stage of my life what's my ministry help me to do it show me what i must do and i'll do it i'm glad i heard his call to start preaching at 23 praise god i accepted my ministry i've failed at times i made mistakes at times but god has kept me he strengthened me and i've accomplished what he's called me to do for these years god forbid that i preach not the gospel of jesus christ i've kept the faith now just for those people that despise doctrine look at verse 9. all these preachers say oh we have too much doctrine not enough power we got to have both whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god hallelujah so when i got the holy ghost i got right doctrine see they said they say well i'd rather have the right spirit than write doctrine well i can have both i can have god and the doctrine god god is the spirit and doctrine is the truth amen i worship in spirit and truth i can have both we can have both we can do it all praise god i don't have to choose one or the other can i have the right teaching or the power i can have both hallelujah amen it's a must exactly right look at the rest of the scripture uh he that yeah he that abideth not in the doctrine hath both i'm sorry he that abideth in the doctor christ had both yeah verse 10 and if any of you and bring out this doctrine and receive him not in your house neither be with him godspeed for he that bit of him godspeed is a partaker of his evil deeds yeah verse 9 if you abide not you have not christ see that's a real wimpy excuse preachers will make because they don't want to study they just want to go back to their own quotes the sermons they preached 10 years ago see i try not to do that to you guys well the bank should say amen on that one amen who has been here a while now too so i don't go back and get this now sometimes i'll pull little bits but i try to make it fresh i try to make it something fresh that god has shown me recently praise god and it builds on yes it's fresh man it builds on the revelation we've already heard because the bible said he brings out treasures new and old oh hallelujah thank god that's right it's an excuse many preachers use oh as long as i got the right spirit i don't have to study doctrine well the bible says if you got god you got the right doctor that makes me feel good praise god you know because you just want to have the word see they're trusting in quotes without taking the quote back to the word every quote we've got to take back to the word remember joseph is the one who says you don't have to take quotes back to the word he said even if they're lies he said i'll still believe that it's still thus saith the lord i'm sorry lies are not thus saith the lord god our god doesn't lie okay last one revelation 3 11. i'll try to close here i'm at uh i'm at 57 minutes so bless your hearts i think it'd be i didn't think it'd be an hour anyways revelation 3 11. brother brahm says these things church by the way i'm like when i read that you know how many years ago was that now 19 years ago i'm like how can the foolish virgin have no reward and look all these years later now i can see it it's in the bible it was there the whole time someone just had to go digging and find these scriptures so we just had to study the word reward amen somebody just had to do it but it's laying there the whole time in quote form we've got to go find it in the word form hallelujah thank god amen oh thank you jesus behold i come quickly hold fast that which thou has that no man take thy crown matthias took judas's crown right he forfeited the crown of an apostle can you imagine that judas no that's right there judas forfeited this for hell he gave up a hundredfold he gave up the highest reward in heaven brother william for 30 pieces of silver how wicked and how shallow that is because the apostle the bible says first the apostle then the prophets and i have quotes brother brahm said the apostle is higher than a prophet i have quotes on that he said that the bible says that an apostle is higher than a prophet but see you start preaching that people say oh he don't believe the message not your version of the message but i believe this message right here that's the same one brother and pointed to you just don't believe it see someone can take your crown if you don't fight and win if you don't become a king in your life somebody will come and take it so may god help us to be kings and priests unto god all right now hopefully that's enough okay now now church salvation is a free gift you don't do anything for salvation except repent and believe that's all you do it's a free gift all these verses say it's a free gift but the same man who says it's a free gift say but rewards are earned by works he says salvation is a free gift but then he says you'll be judged by your works praise god we're not judged are you going to heaven or hell you're going to heaven church but you're judged by what did you do during the time you were working in my vineyard brother amen obama said he's going to ask all of us that brother vang what'd you do while you're working in my vineyard can you imagine that i'm going to stand there brother jesse son what did you do while you were working in the vineyard all those years in akron what did you do lord here's what i did you won't be able to lie right we won't be able to we won't lie or nothing we got to tell the truth there's no line of that holy presence right there there's my hour but church if you want me to preach a whole sermon on that i can later just so you can see it now peter had the keys to the kingdom he said we're all judged by works see at the judgment seat of christ not for salvation we're all salvation's a free gift but we're all judged later and say son i saved you by grace now what did you do how did you show your appreciation for my gift oh jesus i gave everything i could to you i i tried to do everything i could i was so faithful to the house of god i tried to pray for my my saints my brothers and sisters in christ i tried to i did everything i could to help them out that's what i want to say praise god peter says as obedient children be holy i'm holy he says if you call on the father who without respect a person's judge according every man's work a holy ghost-filled preacher who has the keys of the kingdom said the the king of the kingdom is going to judge every man by his works every man oh yeah right there he said pass your time in fear not in frolick fear the lord while you're on this earth so you do the right works peter keeps going he says being born again yeah purifying your souls be born again i'm going to skip past that in other words this born-again experience produces a fruitful life as you labor for the master now look what paul says we shall all everybody say oh stand before the judgment seat of christ every knee shall bow then every everybody say every one of us shall give an account of himself to god brother jesse i'll let you be a pastor there now at this point 15 years what did you do in those 15 years did you preach the truth to them or not did you baptize them the right way did you pray for them to get the holy ghost so yeah i can say amen yes lord yes lord i did not compromise on this word i tried to rightly divide the word of truth praise god amen i tried to fulfill every promise that the bible gave to me now i'm going to skip past this but the bible says there's something with the the preachers where they must give an account for their shepherds i'm sorry for their flocks the shepherds must give account for the flocks there's something about that in hebrews 13 17. so you have to answer individually but then a pastor also has to answer how did he did he walk over the souls of the saints like i said the greatest thing i can see with watching your souls make sure you go to church if you come to church you're likely your soul's going to be in good condition in most cases right by urge and beg people come to church come back to church because you can't be separated from the body of christ and serve christ and love christ you're not you only love christ as you love his people now look revelation 22 this is the white throne judgment 20 verse 12 said the the dead were judged by the things written in the books according to their works so see no matter whether you're a sinner or a saint everybody at one point has to stand before christ and be judged by what they did after they received the grace of salvation the gift of salvation now sinners of course won't have either but they still got to be judged by their works but even though we have free gift of salvation jesus wants you to invest in the talents he's given you he wants you to possess the promised land that he's given you and you're gonna have to answer for how you did it praise god last verse i'm sorry i'm going the wrong way last verse peter says the time has come judgment must begin at the house of god and if at first begin to us what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel so that shows you don't obey god now look and if the righteous now righteous is a lot because remember there's four kinds of believers holy righteous unjust and filthy and if the in other words if the foolish virgins scarcely be saved where should the ungodly and the sinner appear so see the fact you're coming to church is a good sign right you're you're being judged now so there's no judgment of wrath later praise god that's the end of our feet praise god i better stop right there perfectly that's one hour and about five minutes musicians can come was that a blessing by god's grace when william said that last week that just kind of sank in my soul like oh my i need to just bring that out at least one sermon let us strive church to be like joshua and david and caleb and paul all that the lord has called me to do i fulfilled it how many want that testimony tonight now let's pray and ask god let's express it to god with our lips okay let's say with our own lips because we want to be able to recognize lord what season of life and am i in right now and lord what do you want me to do right now and then lord give me the grace to do it amen hallelujah thank you jesus let's pray heavenly father we thank you for this word tonight lord god lord i believe you showed us through jesus words through paul's teaching lord god that there's three levels of rewards for those of us who are born again [Music] lord most of us aren't missionaries so lord we maybe wouldn't expect that hundred fold reward but lord we want to expect a reward because we want to be faithful in all that you call us to do [Music] lord as we saw lord we want to be like joshua we want to be like caleb we'll be like paul and david we want to fulfill all your will for our lives so lord i pray right now in jesus name and we look at our lives lord show us the season of life we're in right now and show us lord what to do in this season dear god i can see through the testimonies you called me to teach before you were training me up lord god teaching me so i could teach others in the previous season lord show me the season now where we are lord i feel like i need to go to my denominational brethren i feel i need to go to those harlot churches and try to call out any predestinated souls in there so they have a chance to hear this message as your prophet said i feel i feel the burden of akron on my shoulders i know all the saints feel it too we want to impact this the city dear god and try to find some souls that want to be saved if the rights are scarce to be saved what about them that are outside the house of god so i pray by your grace lord speak to each one today [Music] show them their season as brother mike mccloskey he's in the season he's trying to figure out his gifts may each one of us the season we're in what we're called to do whether it's teaching or divine healing lord god or dreams or visions or prophecies or god wisdom or knowledge miracles show us the giants we must conquer lord god and give us to take the word of god and take the whole land like joshua took the whole [Applause] [Music] right [Music] lord help us to survive for the pride i serve my generation by the will of god [Music] jesus christ
