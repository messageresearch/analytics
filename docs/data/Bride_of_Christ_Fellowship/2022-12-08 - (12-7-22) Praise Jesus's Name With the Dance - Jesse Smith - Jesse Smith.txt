service by God's grace so I just want to put it on the schedule you know I got uh I have a I made a new friend this week who called me lives in Washington and he's like I heard you want to do a dance service he said I wish I could be a part of that and uh I'm like well yeah we've never done one before I'm researching a dance you know I was a research in Jewish dances and things and I said I don't know if I'll put it out there on the live stream yet I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to do that I said I surely can't dance I don't have any Rhythm you might say but as long as I'm joyful that's all that matters you know so uh I'll try to schedule that in then for uh it would be December 25th oh wait okay Christmas well we could make Christmas a dance service so let's just see about that we'll see about that by God's grace it's only one service anyway that day so we could try that I know in Ghana from what brother Williams says they dance every service at least from is that right sister but okay so they have a dance service every service so I guess we could do a Christmas dance service so you know the Bible said there's a time to dance praise God there's a time to mourn uh so it's a blessing praise God let's take a few prayer requests then here tonight if you just pray for me I've had a little sore throat all week my wife says I'm probably not sleeping enough that's probably right I've been taking as much spray and cough drops and gargling as much as I can I just kind of need God's grace here is it okay well I'll rebuke that in Jesus name by God's grace yeah we had a friend who had that last week and they missed school they never came into school but we had a friend a teacher friend um yeah I definitely reviewed that in Jesus name okay that's great by his grace happy news a couple uh good news uh Gene my mother-in-law's husband had his first cancer treatment today went really good so we thank you for your prayers I think he's got two more if I'm not mistaken or three more okay and then trust that he'll be cancer free also my brother cam his wife Julia had the baby girl today they don't have a name yet but we can thank the Lord for that praise God so the uh the sister Brielle has been wanting she's finally got it she had to wait a few extra years I'm sure was worth the wait I'm sure by God's grace so very thankful cam just sent me the pictures on the drive to church and Malik I was driving so I got to say oh what a precious baby I'm very happy for for the Cameron sister Julia there's a couple sad things though um I have a a friend I see at Giant Eagle every day or some days and he's in his 60s and his 41 year old son committed suicide this week so they're Catholic Malachi met him not long ago and he was in tears today you know he's trying to he's the greeter and he's always so happy and but he wasn't happy today you know and I started crying too talking to him he said will you pray for my son I didn't say anything because he's catholicated I can't pray for a son but I can pray for the family we can pray for the family um you know I went in cases like that I just say it's up to God I don't I don't condemn people to hell I mean usually the way a tree leans that's the way it falls you know but God God will be God will be fair and he will judge the right way that's we have confidence in that um but those are heartbreaking moments he's been a drug addict for years but let's remember his name his name's Al and he said his wife has really taken it hard three boys now they only have two boys and of course they have a few grandchildren and everything but this man was single he didn't have a he didn't have any kids or anything like that just been a drug addict his whole life also brother Simon and Beth Simon's dog passed away today and Simon really loves that dog he chairs ice cream with that dog that's how much he loves that dog so I'm sure he's crying and he's hurting here tonight let's remember brother Simon in prayer by God's grace anybody else have any other what's that oh yeah yeah I'm sorry I said her at the beginning you haven't prayed for bed too that's where they're really close to that dog there brother Chris you have a request brother do you know what he's got or what he's battling okay is it stage four I'm sure that's understandable paper yeah yeah in my experience brother if you don't have a thus saith the Lord is going to be healed I would prepare that he's going to pass and then try to witness to him about the Lord you know you know ask him this question like I was the man on a deathbed I recorded I got the recording too I said are you trusting in Jesus Christ to be saved and he said yes and you know that was a couple days before he passed away so Jesus said If you deny me before men I'll deny you before the Holy Angels but if you recognize me before men I'll recognize you so if you need me to come talk to your grandpa let me know you know we can talk about that but we'll definitely pray for him by the grace of God anyone else have a request here says relina yes amen we're starting to pray for that when I was all in nature okay yeah we'll graphically pray for that by the grace of the Lord Hallelujah anybody else uh Haven yeah pardon me oh you have to remember those six Miracles yes thanks sir yeah a couple weeks ago I was up here Weeping at the altar praying for those and just asking you know Lord I don't know why you know I don't know why you know some people don't get the Miracles you know I don't understand that but I can pray I can pray to the walls come down by God's grace you know you just your heart goes out to people who hurt physically hurting um and I just wish I could do the miracle but I'll never be able to do one only Jesus could do it in other words I wish I could ease their pain out I'm sure you feel the same way so let's remember them in prayer I appreciate that to him by God's grace it's powerheads here for word of prayer here tonight father God we love you Lord we've loved to sing these songs Lord especially this last one what an uplift Lord God and we sing unto you Lord a new song Lord God and we lord worship you today I give you all thanks and praise all honor to the name of Jesus Christ feels so good to worship you and the beauty of Holiness Lord I I feel such Freedom here tonight Lord I thank you for that Lord God yet at the same time Lord God I'm thinking about those who are hurting it Lord God in such a paradox Lord as Paul said we could be ever rejoicing but yet uh uh he said um he said I'm struggling but not defeated you know and Lord such a paradox we can struggle and you can see people struggle Lord and yet at the same time we can Rejoice on the things you've done Lord God and it just helps us to understand that we're a body and we need to feel for other people Lord God so father tonight Lord we come by the blood of Jesus Christ we ask you Lord to forgive our sins May nothing hinder these prayers Lord we just learned over the years that we've got to trust you Lord God we've got to make our request in order to you and Trust You Lord God at times you've done great things and you've answered immediately other times or you ask us to wait Lord you teach us long-suffering you teach us patience you teach us trust Lord God so we come to you Lord with confidence knowing that you will do what's right dear God and you will do it in your time and season we just want to Humble ourselves and Lord we just want to recognize that you're above all Lord God and you are you're just and you're powerful you're mighty and you're great you're the awesome God the only wise God the scripture says we thank you for your love and compassion today thank you for the son or your son Jesus

tonight father God lord we just come with Faith Lord we ask God you heal the sick and The Afflicted Lord God we pray Lord God for Chris's grandfather Lord in Jesus Christ and we pray you make a way Lord God that he could be healed Lord Lord we've seen you numerous times bring people out of hospice Lord God you are such a great healer but Lord I pray you show your your will to us Lord and brother Chris and father our Lord I pray Lord Chris could have these important conversations about Jesus Lord or Lord if I could do it or Austin or someone that he knows the Lord got it so we would know his grandpa is ready to meet you Lord God in peace Lord God so father we ask for healing of the body but also healing of the Soul if his Soul's not ready to meet you God I pray God for our Lord God and Simon and Beth Lord they've lost Lord and of course Al's case a much harder loss Lord they've lost a 40 year old son Lord God so I pray you'd Comfort Al and his family Lord God and he's been such a

with them Lord in a great way Lord God minister to their needs and I'm sure we'll hear a testimony about it Lord God I think it happened the last time Lord that this other dog passed away there was a testimony that came out of it and Lord we know the Lord there's a purpose for this often it reminds us Lord that we have to meet death Lord God we've got to go that route and we need to be ready also Lord as a reminder there is a resurrection dear God this is not the end of uh these lives Lord many times God we know there's animals in heaven and Lord we know of course the soul has eternal life

we just pray for great works to be done your father meet the unspoken needs here tonight Lena's in Nature's God you know what was behind that that testimony or that question rather Lord God you know what's behind that unspoken need father I pray you ministered to it and Lord no doubt each one of us have an unspoken need so we lift them up to you we pray Lord that as we're preaching and as we're praying afterwards and singing God we'd feel your presence and Lord we would be obedient to that presence we would fear the lord Hallelujah Lord we would learn to morally reference you Lord God and Obey in all these areas of Our Lives dear God make us more like you Lord you said you would conform us to the image of your dear son we know it's not the physical image you're not trying to get us to have shoulder length hair or all be five foot one or five foot two Lord but Lord we understand you're shaping us into the spiritual character of Jesus Christ Lord God what a privilege that we have here tonight I pray God you shape us to modus shape our character to be more christ-like the father be those live streaming Lord as I talked with my friend there Lord God out in Washington today knowing that he's probably live streaming here tonight are you minister to him and different ones around the world Lord that are being ministered to thank you God that Lord you can strengthen the Saints Lord God through our just humble little lives and father we just thank you and we rejoice in all you've done and we continue to ask you Lord God to minister to our needs here tonight in Jesus Christ's name and Saint said amen God bless you let's stand and take our Bibles here tonight I like you open up to the Book of Psalms please Psalm chapter 149 verses one to three I'd like to begin ministering on Dance so my title tonight is praise Jesus's name in the dance praise God Psalm 149 verse 1. Psalm 140 9 verse 1. I'll read one and two and then we'll read three together here praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the Saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King Hallelujah let's read verse three together ready one two three let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and the Heart praise God may God has blessings are reading of his word you may be seated praise God all right so we'd like to uh I got some scriptures to show by God's grace I'd like to begin looking at this here tonight pulling up a few notes that I had here it was kind of like a last minute thing I just started studying it uh I'm not mistaken yesterday if I'm not mistaken you know so sometimes you got the thoughts well in advance sometimes you're uh you're just studying up with you're studying at the last minute by God's grace good to see you brother Ray God bless you sir Hallelujah so uh you know I was thinking about dance and uh how many times I've danced around the church and how I love it and we talked about having a dance service and I saw I thought well I want to study on that I want to get a good understanding on that by the scripture so I like to begin looking at that maybe this will be a two or three part series you know the fear of the Lord would I could do a couple more on that you know because there's more verses on the fearing the Lord but I'd like to look at this here tonight and Trust to be a blessing to you you know the uh the Hebrew word for dance has a couple of different words and eventually when you get back to the root word it's the word uh I don't know how to say it it's chol c-h-u-l or I guess another maybe it's cool or can you kahil not sure exactly what is it cool I can't say I'm not Hebrew I know our brother studied it so um It's A Primitive route and it says it's to it means to properly twist or whirl in a circular or spiral pattern twisting or whirling in a spiral pattern that is to dance specifically to dance some of the words mean shake or tremble but the main part there at least in the top of the definition means to so whirl so think about that you know how we I looked all around I found no one you know that's it we've got to dance around the church you know times and that's a good thing to do by God's grace if we should dance for anybody should be for Jesus praise God that's why my title was praise Jesus's name in the dance because the Old Testament just has praised his name we don't speak enough Yahweh you know you know speaking of Jehovah but Jesus Christ is Jehovah the Old Testament right Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new and so we know God created All Things by Jesus Christ Hallelujah and we know in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God hallelujah so Jesus Christ is the word of God praise God and so we just want to look at this thought here I got lots of slides here so actually I'm going to skip a little bit well I guess you know yeah I guess I'll just start right here then we'll just get to the verses you know as you probably read before heard brother Brandon said dance means victory or in the Hebrew uh I'm sorry for what I read in the the dictionaries another word is re rejoicing dance means to Rejoice you when you rejoice you dance I know when brother Austin got his uh bills debts paid off I dance around the church for that I told the Lord I said Lord if you pay off all his debts I'll dance around the church I made a vow with the Lord hallelujah um other times I dance you know and I think amen some with amen's job I danced around the church for that I don't remember what it was I don't know if it was when you be able you were able to come all day or every Sunday that might have been it this is a couple years ago now I'm going back a long time here but uh that's the whole thing you know that's why you dance you're dancing because you're rejoicing you're thankful to God you're joyful and uh dancing is Victory what brother Adam says and of course this is 1950 but still applies to today he said there Israel was called out a type of the church Israel always was a type of the church that church was natural and the church is spiritual today they was called out as soon as they were called out they passed through the Red Sea baptized into Moses and as soon as they come on the other side they were baptized with the spirit now I made that in blue because we see brother Ram's growth in his terminology for the baptism of the Holy Ghost right because later Brothers going to tell us they weren't born again in type at the Red Sea they didn't get born again in type until canaan's land so see how brother Ram grew in his Revelation everybody see that Miriam picked up a tambourine and down the bank she went dancing Hallelujah yes sir she had the victory did you ever get that much and the church said did you ever get that much Victory praise God see I think it's just beautiful how brother man brings it out like that all right she was dancing in the spirit and all the daughters of Israel followed her dancing Moses did with his hands up and sang in the spirit praise God hallelujah now just so you know later on you know here's finishing the quote why they laid all those taskmasters laying behind them and all the things they ever done the meanest they and the things you've done when you see the red blood of Jesus Christ is cleanse you from all your sins you can sing too with a Victorious song Hallelujah Amazing Grace how sweet this out that saved a wrets like me Hallelujah so brother Ram you know he uses it the natural type to the spiritual in the natural their natural taskmasters was gone when the spiritual all of our sins are in the sea of forgetfulness and the spiritual our past is gone our past doesn't have to haunt us hallelujah amen all the records of the past sins is all gone praise God if you've confessed your sins Jesus forgives it the Bible said he forgives us of all transgressions Hallelujah can't let Satan bring those taskmasters back they are drowned they're no more praise God yes we have current sins we have to confess and no doubt future sins of time goes on but anything from the past when you're a Christian it's been forgiven you praise God Hallelujah now if there's something from the past that comes back and you feel like you need to make it right well go make it right praise God but the guilt of it or the punishment for it has already been taken care of praise God he was wounded for your woundings that you deserve praise God the punishment for your past sin was paid for and if there's anything that you can undo yes try to undo it like I've told you I used to steal from my mom I gave her hundreds if not you know a couple thousand dollars you know over these years to try to make it right until I felt peace like okay that's probably good enough like I told you the last time I went into the the bank and they let me do something and I should not have done they let me deposit money in her account without her knowing that was probably breaking some law but hopefully the cops don't hear this they'll come arrest me and they'll show me take me out to jail for give my mom money all right I'm guilty I wonder what my bond will be but you know you you do that and uh if there's things you made wrong you know you go back and make it right I mean I had numerous friends in high school I said I said hateful I really said hateful things to them and when I became a Christian I went back and said you know what I'm very sorry I said I hated this about you in high school I'm very sorry and they're like oh brother Jess and they call me brother Justin oh Jess you know but I said no it's something I had to do some of you know my cousin Matt I said some of the office things that my cousin Matt when I was a young boy but at a football game at one of Paul's football games years ago I went and I said can I talk to you down here and we left the stands and I went down there and I said you know what Matt I'm so sorry I said that to you I said forgive me I started crying and now before that he was really kind of cold shoulder to me and now you've seen how he treats me I'll be like Matt I love you he's like I love you more foreign ever since I confessed that sin to him he has loved me with like amazing love I guess as much as a sinner can love you you know um so I just want to tell you know there are things if you did some really awful things and you get a chance make it right but you never have to pay for that sin because that's why Christ died for you so you gotta we have to find that balance that's what Zacchaeus did he made his wrongs right he said if I stole from anybody I'll give him four times the amount I stole from them so hopefully I'll reach that amount if not after sneaking in the bank sometime again and do that so just so you know brother Brown later would say this is 10 years later justification was leaving Egypt they crossed the Red Sea right they killed the things behind them the test Masters which was sanctification through the blood that kills all the human desires of evil second stage of the journey okay so now even changes later he said the second stage was the wilderness so in later quotes brother Brown says you know coming out of Egypt and then Crossing Jordan was was step one justification Wilderness with sanctification and then Crossing Jordan was the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I just want you to see how brother M Gruen is understanding but the main point is dance is Victory now you may remember this story I'm not going to read all this but there was a time when brother Ram saw people dancing in the church and he said that's horrible now look church he didn't blast him the Holy Ghost because he didn't understand it yet right he said oh my that's terrible people dancing and then one night he was having a meeting a New Year's Eve service and I want you to notice and you'll probably be thankful he preached four and a half hours I'm still waiting for my turn maybe this New Year's Eve straight straight two and a half is the longest ever preached down there in Guyana because they just kept pulling I almost died after the service I felt like I'd fasted all day I still got the recording of it I I was listening to it the other day two and a half hours um some ladies come up and want to beat on some little tin cans and things so look at the instruments they had we're pretty blessed to have the instruments we got on a washboard I guess you've seen the hookup one was playing the piano they started playing song there's gonna be that meeting in the air right that sweet sweet bye and bye the little lady turned real wide around the mouth and began to beat the piano I'm not sure how that looks man she said I believe if there have been three decks of keys she would have played them every one so her hands otherwise her hands are going like this me okay I never seen such a plane in my life that lady on the washboard hitting them with the Thimbles a thimble okay now thimble on a metal washboard I never seen such blonde headed sister about so high jumped out in the floor and started dancing and I was sitting there in my Tabernacle I thought oh my here it is I thought now why'd they have to do that so I waited looked around and they looked up at me imagine everybody looked up at the pastor what are you going to do about that Pastor just like you do sometimes Brothers what are you gonna say about that wow we couldn't wait to say something I thought oh I'm a fundamentalist you couldn't show me that in the Bible and he says where did Dancing ever come from he was sitting in the seat of the scornful look at that he was in the seat of McCall he was scornful why do they dance why do they got to dance like that he said he said I was afraid to say anything because I was afraid they might be right and me wrong look at that there's the Holy Spirit right there see sometimes God will keep you from saying things because you're a child of God and God wants to spare you from a little shame and I'll say Amen to that God spared me from things I've said before I've said them and I thought isn't that terrible right right in here in my tap look my Tabernacle later God sent him out and said it's not your Tabernacle right he said this lady up there her eyes closed just dancing around first thing you know got another one started I thought oh my I began to rehearse in my mind in in that Bible they did dance I thought when they danced what was it Pharaoh was pursuing Israel the enemy was drowned Miriam picked up a tambourine and began to dance and all the daughters followed her dancing I thought well there they had the victory and I read in David when the ark had been away so long and when he returned back why he was so happy started dancing he had the victory his sweetheart made fun of him kind of laughed at him he said well if you don't like that watch this and down there he went round and around he went again I thought well she set up there and laughed at him and God put a curse on her and thought David thou art a man after my own heart well I thought the only thing is the matter with me I just got I just ain't got enough Victory Maybe in a few minutes something happened now this might shock you when I come to myself I was out there with that little girl dancing on the floor that's right just the thing I thought I wouldn't do I did now church that's what the Holy Ghost does to you sometimes you will do the things you never thought you'd do yeah I never thought I'd preach I never thought I'd dance in church I never thought I'd scream or shout or cry or weep or I never thought I'd do any of that but the Holy Ghost makes you do things you won't think you'll do amen brother says sometimes God will do it to you to Humble you to get all the starch out of you as I told the brother on the phone today around Washington I'm like I don't even care at this point I hardly care what anybody thinks anymore right right because if they don't think I'm a fanatic by now then I don't know they must actually be a real saint most people probably think I'm a fanatic that's okay I probably am amen I'm a fanatic for Jesus praise God and I like it that way praise God I don't want to be a chained up fearful scared uh prisoner of the world Amen I want to be God's free man Hallelujah thank you Jesus amen I spent the first 19 years of my life in in Chains I spent the first 19 years of life and the change of sin in the church and didn't like church didn't like going to church and when I became saved and when I became I couldn't wait to raise my hands and then this was as far as I could raise him when I got saved I look around and say who's raising anyone's raising their hands if not I'll put them down but you better believe I wanted to raise them then when I came to message yeah now I finally got some Freedom Hallelujah thank God Amen I could raise and shout and cry and rejoice and leave with the best of them praise God I think about that mishawashi Mr Walker preacher how he he jumped up and clicked his heels like that you know he's old man he said you ain't got enough room for me to preach up here that's about our church right we already got enough room for me to preach up here I almost pulled a muscle on that jump there I got to start stretching out before I jump around here getting older now but that's what the Holy Spirit does Church it makes us do things we wouldn't think we do because it's not about our desires it's about God's glory praise God just the thing I thought I'd never do I was never on a dance floor in my life but I guess I did it all right I sure about awful good I had a lot of Victory after that and brother Jeff said amen Hallelujah and George that's what I you know I danced a few weeks ago around here I was having a good old time sometimes when that music just gets going I just I just got to move I I got to give God some glory amen and the next day I'll notice it's easy to read my Bible it's easier to pray it's easier to get up I've noticed that church and if you haven't done it bro I mean I've said have you done it yet have you done have you tried it yet praise God that's what Ram said have you ever felt like that where you're so free and you got all the Victory church if not make a vow with God say God if you do this I'll dance around the church for you that's what I've done I've done that a couple times with Austin like I said with brother amen and other times I Just Dance because I feel good I feel like dancing I'm good I'm good I'm in good health I dance at the school why can't I dance at the church we dance for Jesus in my classroom praise God I've done that for years why can't I dance in God's house amen Hallelujah so God's in music don't You Believe God's music certainly God's in music he's an art and God's in this universe he's in his creatures he's in his church he's in his creation he's in the universe God's all around just everywhere he's here in the Shriner Auditorium right now this night he's here at bride of Christ Fellowship tonight he's right president here tonight God's everywhere I just wonder sometimes if he just take the shades off her eyes to our sight would be fast enough to catch his presence in the building I don't know how often brother Ram dances may be one of the one or a few times on tape that he talks about it I know out in the Canadian wilderness when he was way up there you know he heard he heard uh the elk cry for the he heard the mail elk cry for the female elk and then he heard the chitter chatter the Chipmunk was trying to discourage him then he saw the eagle and he said he got so excited he ran around the tree and was praising his maker you know he said oh he said this is where God's at God's in his creation amen he said he was he said if people would have saw me they would have thought I was insane that I just got out of an insane institution praise God he said he's kicking Up The Mulch on the ground and the leaves and everything just praising God oh my if you haven't felt like that I pray you'll feel like that sometime praise God if you can't do it around nobody else at least do it between you and God Amen Hallelujah that's right church that's right what is dance to twist to whirl in a circular spiral manner Hallelujah I'm going to skip past this I'm going to get to the verses yeah I'll get back to that later well maybe we'll see kind of how the time goes here 37 30 man that clock's a busy body uh let's look at just briefly dancing in the Bible a couple of these I didn't get a chance to study all the way on so I'm not going to read a couple of these but these are familiar the first mention of dancing in the Bible is Miriam dance is Victory and if you notice it's just the women dancing with the women and so that's where I found it good that's what I saw in Ghana too the Ghana when William sent me the videos all the sisters dance on one side and all the brothers dance on the other side that's a good thing to do praise God that's a real wise thing to do so Moses was singing in the spirit you should I mean we should read that song sometime maybe we don't have it all the time I'm just gonna hit the highlights tonight but he was singing the spirit and pretty soon Miriam gets out there gets out the tambourine and all the sisters start to dance and and they start answering Moses back so Moses would say the Lord is a man of war the Lord is a man of war and men would say singing to the Lord for you Triumph gloriously I don't know how wet you but you you get the picture it was the answer it's kind of like is he Worthy is all the world groaning he is I'm sorry is all the world groaning it is is the new creation coming it is it's an answer it's a call and answer song Amen Hallelujah and remember they just seen all their uh other task Masters they've just seen all their past they've just seen any threat Hallelujah of any future life would be an awful life any threat to their future was just washed away praise God they were just giving a clean bill of life amen hallelujah no more slavery I'll never be a slave again praise God because there ain't nobody to make me a slave ah Church there's nobody that can make you a slave tonight Jesus set you free Hallelujah sorry okay I'm gonna spit on malcast sorry about that buddy nobody can make you a Slave it's all done you just got to stay out of Egypt and the church said or can I say like this get all the Egypt out of you amen that's what I need to do right because we so we have the sin nature inside of us it's hatred against God see that's what the Bible says the flesh is enmity the flesh is hatred against God and sometimes our minds are too when we when we Harbor the wrong thoughts so Miriam got the Tam room out all the women followed her so see we need somebody to be the leader that's why I said Naomi and uh Beatrice are going to be our leaders there I'm just kidding you don't have to be I'll lead if I have to I'm the pastor God is good I can't dance anyway so I just I dance for Jesus as far as anything that can look like it's a real dancing but see somebody's got to catch the Holy Spirit Moses caught the spirit and started singing hallelujah amen song leader Hallelujah and then somebody's got to catch a spear to dance amen and notice everybody joined in all the women joined in on the dance Hallelujah and so that's what we want to have we're just free where if you feel led you can dance if you don't feel led you don't have to dance but I'll tell you you have a lot of Victory if you do dance praise God you're missing out just like you're missing out on a good shot for Jesus the church said you feel real good you shout kind of wakes you up Hallelujah you feel alive again you get out of that rut that you're in right we get sometimes we're in that rut oh woe is me I'm tired I've got a headache sore throat feeling sick we start talking about Jesus things change amen thank God Hallelujah it does something to you praise God it changes the atmosphere Hallelujah thank you Jesus now here's part of Moses song then saying Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake and saying I will sing unto you imagine Moses singing 80 year old Prophet I will sing unto the Lord for he hath trying gloriously the horse and his rider he's thrown into the sea you know he gets going Miriam's answering back and forth and this is the first time so the first time dance is mentioned in the Bible is the first time the word salvation is mentioned in the Bible do you think there's a connection to that I think so this wasn't written by no man this was written by God wanted to place salvation at the same spot as dancing the same place as all your enemies drowning the sea the same place where you are officially out of Egypt hallelujah thank God Amen I'm officially out of Egypt and nobody can take me back Hallelujah yes Glory thank you Jesus Egypt always represents the world Egypt is the first really civilization uh or the Kingdom built by man in the Bible right Tower of Babel got started but God stopped it but if you look at the Bible the first major civilization the first major kingdom was Egypt so it represents the epitome of Satan's kingdom but God used it as a type to bring Israel to show us God was going to bring us out of the kingdom of darkness Hallelujah and he was going to bring us into the Kingdom of Light Hallelujah that's the first time we see salvation in the Bible Moses singing the Lord has become my strength and my song and he has become my salvation he is my God and I will prepare him and habitation yeah he got he got going and Mary said we've got to go get the tamarinds out come on somebody hallelujah thank you Jesus that's the first time they danced was when they had the victory Glory they had forgiveness they had a future ah oh my the past was gone Hallelujah a new life Oh I thought I'd get more amens on that Hallelujah a new life has started a new life in Christ Hallelujah that came to pass Exodus 32. now of course this is sinful dancing Moses and Aaron come into the camp and the Israelites the same people that were dancing for Jesus are now dancing for the devil we see it all the time I don't have to be dancing but you live for you live in the message for a while then you go back out in the world same thing same spirit right the spirit of Satan any any uh rejoicing over idolatry right any any idolatry would lead to this kind of dancing they'll laugh they'll Rejoice they'll they'll shout they'll show all their emotions for the world but be cold on God that's an evil spirit of idolatry right that's why I was telling uh well I told the church over and over again you you know you watch these sinful sports games or you go to sinful movies and you can spend two and a half hours laughing and shouting and spending money on on the sinful things and you come to church and you're dead quiet that shows your soul is dead if you can be emotional about the things of the world and love them and be excited and clap and and jump and dance if you can do that for Satan and you're cold on God you are lost and going to hell unless you repent and message people do that I know them they're not message people they're Pretenders they're like the mixed multitude that's what happened a mixed multitude come out of the denomination ah but not us we're like Joshua and Caleb we got a different Spirit hallelujah amen and you know why because my life proves it praise God the proof is in the pudding the proof is in your life amen hallelujah I don't dance for the world I dance for Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Jesus now this is this is a sad story I don't quite understand the story I don't know if uh Jeff and I had to sacrifice his daughter or she just didn't have to be married the rest of her life but anyways he come back from the battle and he was met with timbrose and dancing so there was a dancing act after a victory in battle see church when you come to Revival like amen who are talking about her if anybody has the victory that's a good time to dance when you're happy when you're feeling it that's a time to dance Hallelujah because you feel it praise God you fear the victory you feel the rejoicing that's the time that's how you should know this is my time to Rejoice this is my time to give God thanks because I know more valleys are coming but while I'm on the Mountaintop let me give him a dance Amen Let me give him a shout let me give him a praise because he's worthy he brought me up to this mountain amen I know what the valleys are like church right that's the time to give God praise after the victory Hallelujah no that's what I didn't understand so I made it real obvious on my notes like I don't understand that one um it was a case where uh women were dancing and they were caught and robbed in the days of Judges that's no surprise judges is like the most uh Wicked book of as far as Israel they had backslidden so far it's like Israel without Joshua I'm sorry yeah Israel without Joshua had become the Book of Judges right no prophet and it was just awful now here's the one where the women danced um and it says nothing about men dancing okay this after David slug Goliath and uh notice they're singing they're singing their women are singing dancing they're playing they're worshiping God see another great victory the giant fell Hallelujah church when the giant Falls you ought to give God glory praise God when the giant Falls we give God the glory but notice Saul I David from that day forward Saul wasn't hearing the Praises he wanted the Praises he should have just been happy his brother got the victory because his brother had the courage to go out there and fight him and he didn't right how sad is that somebody does something you're jealous of their you're jealous of their uh you didn't have the courage you were you were afraid to do it but you're jealous of them because they had the courage and they got the Victory and God bless him and you're jealous of them it shows it shows us we got to keep our eyes on Christ the Bible said Saul idem from that day forward if I get a chance I'm gonna do something bad to him let's keep our eyes on Jesus because if we keep him on Jesus pretty soon we're gonna see those nail scarred hands amen where those good to get those scars in the house of my friends and he was Scarred For You and I he died for our wickedness for our iniquities bruised for our iniquities Hallelujah so we see a great testimony there now here this is a strange thing in fear David acted insane when he was uh at the at the king akish's uh Kingdom there the men of akish knew the women dance for David's victory over Goliath but now he was running from Saul so the dancing look at this this just shows how far Our Testimony will go oh my if mountains fall or if mountains move in 2023 Hallelujah and we get some miracles in this church we ought to dance and it ought to spread a testimony to other close churches by God's grace Hallelujah because that's what happened in David's day they at these nearby uh Heathen kingdoms had heard about the dancing they'd heard about the shouting they heard about the victory amen oh God give us Grace until the victories come Hallelujah help us to hang on to her sometimes you know the victory's just right around the corner we may think it's never going to happen how can it happen and Churchill we just hang on and give God praise in the hard times how do we know the victory is just not coming next week or something praise God we don't know so let's let's let's let's be full of Faith praise God let's encourage ourselves in the Lord like David did Hallelujah remember David act like he was crazy to get out of there uh David is such an awesome character of the Bible here uh David said can't thou bring me down to this company and he said swear unto me by God that thou will neither kill me nor deliver me in the hands of my master I'll bring thee down to this company okay uh when he brought them down behold they were spread abroad upon all the Earth eating and drinking okay so this is after uh the enemy had come and taken David's spoils and his family they've taken all the Israelites spoils and it was that sick lag right and David prayed Lord do I go he inquired the Lord Lord do I go get it back and the Lord said go take all of it back and so when David finally got there all these heathens were rejoicing in dance so again showing how Sinners dance over their victories and the Sinners dance over victories what about us praise God you think Satan's going to get all the glory and we're not going to give it God any glory god deserves the glory praise God he deserves a good dance style every day every now and then praise God he deserves a few swirls or a few Twirls he's so great praise God how can you contain it we got to give God glory Hallelujah Hallelujah the Cleveland guardians or Indians do not deserve our praising Glory they haven't done nothing for me nothing and even though the Cavs won the uh the NBA championship in 2016 they haven't done nothing for me praise God I don't even care right they just getting steeper and deeper into sin deeper and deeper into wickedness it just gets worse and worse it's rotting it's decaying oh but the word of God is forever alive amen the word of God is life Hallelujah Hallelujah brother Adam said if the word won't give your life nothing will bring your life praise God oh thank God the preaching of the word is what brings life Hallelujah that's why Jesus said go and preach go and teach All Nations Hallelujah that's exactly right so David spoiled their dance party I'm sure he started a dance party for Israel as soon as they got back no doctors No Doubt here David dancer for the Lord when the ark was returning with all of his might and day was girded with the Leonard ephod so he put on the Priestly garments because David was prophet priest king oh Hallelujah so Dave and all the house of Israel brought up the Arkham Lord was shouting and with the sound of the trumpet you're telling me they can shout under the blood of bulls and goats but we can't shout under the blood of Jesus Christ I'm gonna shout amen I'm going to shout out of Jesus Amen thank God for the blood of God's son Hallelujah they can shout about the Old Testament what about the new Hallelujah as our Lord came in the city of David McCall Saul's daughter looked through a window the man said she said I saw King David leaping and dancing so again leaping if I stretched out enough here leaping for the Lord clicking the heels together David was leaping for the Lord I'd like to show the kids at school that jump you know they like that jump he wasn't just you know walking around and you know the answer he was leaving for the Lord not with some of his Mike Church with all of his mind that's about as high as I can jump right there you want to see one more time okay that's all my my that's all I got tonight I just pulled a muscle no I'm just kidding see David love the Lord and so he didn't care what anybody said he he knew God was in his midst amen he knew God Favored him he knew God gave him all those victories God's given us every Victory we ought to rejoice in what he's done for us praise God I was just there when it happened Hallelujah I was just there amen it was Jesus that did the work Jesus did the grace Jesus did the power I was just there when it happened praise God oh thank you Jesus leaping and dancing see sometimes Church let me say like this if you dance just expect someone you're going to criticize you just have an answer ready to go oh you didn't like that wait till you see this now I'm gonna go again am I going what do you like this thank you Jesus Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah you didn't like that it was for God it wasn't for you that's right I didn't come here to dance for you I came here to give God the praise because the words returned ah Paul's gospel has returned the water baptisms returned the God has returned Hallelujah the fivefold Ministries returned the Seven Seals are revealed amen I ought to give God praise amen I ought to thank God we have the original word amen Hallelujah [Applause] that's what we got thank God we got the prince of the Lord here that's exactly right it's up to God what he wants to do well we've got to be yielded vessels the more we yield the more we're one Accord the more we'll see God move but don't forget this too you know brother may have said the sign of a Believer is these signs follow them that believe that's true but we don't know how often they're supposed to come God don't say how often he's going to do it he just said they follow us so I'm glad every now and then we get another sign that follows us praise God that's a beautiful thing so we rejoice in that these signs follow us because we're Believers praise God Glory so we can express criticism we can expect it now you know all the criticism I've got over these you know 14 years on YouTube I'm kind of used to it now but every now and then I'll get somebody that's a real big name and they'll criticize me then my heart will start beating but most of the time it's like I mean yeah just join the club everybody else is criticizing me you can just join the club be a Critic but I always got to answer back I'm praying for you and I hope this helps you God bless you I hope this helps you I hope God will bless you with repentance is what I say to some of these uh these criticizers because church I know we've got the truth and it's proven we have the fruits of the truth hallelujah thank God so see you're going to be despised when you dance for the Lord but not by God and that's all that matters amen as long as God is calling you to give him a dance then you're in you're in the right and brother Adam said I don't I don't have the code in front of me but brother man said as long as you live right he says as long as the people lives right it doesn't you know it's okay as long as they live right maybe I should try to find that quote here real quick here as long as the people lives right I know it's in the seals here let me see if I can find it as long as they live right I don't know if I'll find it we'll see if we get blessed if we get blessed to get it we'll see no I don't think I gotta I think as long as the people live right you maybe have heard it yep I got that one coming up too but yeah I wrote that one down I didn't get a chance to quote it but that's the right but the RAM said only live or jump as high as you live Hallelujah so like I've said if I if I've overcome cigarettes and chewing tobacco and dirty magazines and and uh uh you know movies and and cuss and swear and hating people if I haven't lived if I've lived if I'm living above that how should I jump I should jump pretty high Hallelujah thank God that's how you should do too praise God thank you for your patience as long as the people oh it's Liv's right it's lives right it's that Kentucky grammar right as long as the people lives right yeah there it is brother man said I know there's a lot of fanaticism this is the fourth seal people carrying on I know sometimes they do it when the music is jumping up and down and everything I know that goes I know and I believe that too and the church said brother man believes when the music going it's okay to jump up and down it's okay to rejoice he said but I've seen people in the day when as long as the music is playing everybody was jumping and screaming but when the music stopped it stopped see I believe that well that's still all right as far as I'm concerned see as long as the people lives right let me tell you church I've seen both I've seen people dance and say true to God I've seen people dance run around the church and leave the message and go back to three persons and the fathers and Holy Ghost and criticize Brother Brad I've seen both I've seen on both sides Hallelujah so what does it show I mean it shows you get anointed on the flesh which is good the thing is we need anointing on all three courts praise God that's a thing God wants to know all three parts of our body praise God of our being rather Body Spirit soul that's the thing and so when the word comes it shows who's got the anointing on the soul Glory that's right the shouting screaming dancing or whatever weeping crying that just shows the holy spirit's on the body or this in the spirit too but when the word of Correction comes who's able to receive that now we see who's got it in the soul praise God because Jesus looked at his disciple said you want to go to you guys want to go too you said Peter said those wonderful words where we go Lord thou Hast the words of eternal life where am I going to go back to the Catholic Church where am I going to go back to the Pentecostal church and try to speak in tongues right which would be okay to speak in tongues like we thank God for that should I go back to the Methodist Church and try to accept the lgbq2 or QT whatever they got should I try to accept that should we go back to the Baptist and just be stiff as a board sitting staring Stern okay all right we'll go out now should I go back to that what should I do I should go back to the word praise God hallelujah and this is the word hallelujah thank God Amen and this is a man after God's Own Heart right now Church let's be that let's be men and women after the heart of God all of his physical strength all of it you know every Sunday I leave here I always start feeling when I'm sorry I start feeling all this sweat go down the middle of my back because I'm preaching so hard I almost feel it yet tonight I'm starting to get a little bit here I try to give all my might right without without putting myself in more danger being sick you know but when I'm healthy I give it all you got praise God preach so hard to your voice gets sore you know hands are bleeding you give all your strength God that's what Jesus said love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength let's give God all of our strength praise God see church we give our work so much strength let's give God some of that strength praise God now we what I'm saying is we have to give it to work we have to but let's preserve some of that strength for God too praise God right if I wanted to I could let everything sap I could let all the problems of school day I could let it sap all the joy and strength out of my life I could go home like oh how could that parent say that about me and didn't they know I emailed they missed the email I could I could go I could just I could just give myself over that to be so discouraged or I can say I'm sorry I'll do better next time have a good night let's go praise the Lord now I mean I got the choice hallelujah what am I gonna am I gonna be up man after the heart of the parents or am I going to meet a man after the heart of God that's what I want to be and I know with my heart's after God's heart everything else will work out okay I love them I'll treat them respect kindness I know if I'm after God's heart then I'll have a heart to love them as well this is another uh yeah this is right afterwards then David returned now look he dances what does he do he comes back he starts blessing people so you can look for victory you're going to bless people you're not going to be so self-centered anymore you're not being criticizing other people because now you got the victory you're gonna be blessing other people ah come on somebody yes Michael come out to me and look she come out like I gotta tell him how he was dancing today he was so vile oh my goodness oh how Glory now she comes out with all the sarcasm oh how glorious you were at church today thanks for embarrassing me hubby you uncovered yourself in the days in the eyes of the handmaids of the servants as one of the vain you see he says as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovered himself all he did was he took off his kingly robes and just put on the ephot he wasn't naked anybody that has any sense in the Bible knows he wasn't naked he took off the king robes and put on the ephot of the priest it was less close it was wasn't that heavy outer garment on oh you just shamed me today and look what David said it was all before the Lord sister I wasn't dancing for you again I'm gonna say that again when you dance or raise your hands that's not for you or somebody else that's for God right God wants your praise God wants your hands raised God God wants your amens God wants your hallelujahs God wants your dance Hallelujah God Wants You on the altar praise God Amen God doesn't want an animal on the altar he doesn't want flowers on the altar he wants you on the altar praise God Hallelujah that's why I lay on the altar because I know I'm dying to myself right there I'm dying to myself so I don't preach and I don't feel the headache I got while I'm preaching and the church said yet I feel sometimes I Gotta Die there am I gonna accept Jesse's body feelings or am I going to go with the spirit of God I'm going with the spirit of God well listen honey it was before the Lord who chose me before your dad and all of his house so God chose me above your daddy and your uncles and everybody else Brothers in your house I was chosen for this amen I was chosen before the foundation of the world Amen to live and learn to see you and be an overcomer praise God I didn't ask to come here God sent me here praise God God sent you here hallelujah above all these denominations that are waiting in sin God chose me above all them oh God thank God and he made me the ruler over the people and in my case he made me pastor and I told my wife I said I'm so glad God made me a pastor I couldn't sit under some of the other teachings that I hear from some of the other pastors so thankful praise God see God did that therefore I will play before the Lord [Applause] just be a child just just enjoy the friends of the Lord just tell God how much you love him I'll just have freedom I'll just have a wonderful joyful time I just it just guided me praise God Amen amen it's not Michael and me it's God in Me or Macau whatever however you say it it's not Michael it's Macau and I love this and I will yet be more vile than thus you haven't seen nothing sister wait till I get some energy back wait till I get my second wind one more song I'll be more involved than that but yeah I'll be humble in my own sight because it's all it's look what God has done oh my God's art God's Ark was wandering out there in the wilderness God's Ark didn't have a place God's Ark was far away from the city of Jerusalem the city of God but now God's Ark which represents his presence has come back to his sin he praise God God has come back to inhabit with his people praise God that's why you rejoiced amen God came back to dwell in his people and church says we start seeing this revival increase which I believe is going to increase Hallelujah as we see God's spirit coming back or more of God's fear more Revival we should see more Victory praise God when we see the word the presence of God came back the prince of God was coming back to the position that's where it is today the Revelation is come bringing the people back to their position back to the book of Acts we'll walk where the apostles have tried Hallelujah if you don't like that sister wait till you see what I got next and of the maidservance which thou spoken of they're actually going to have me in honor you're thinking you think they're going to despise me but really they're going to honor me see church that's how it is I mean my wife can tell you all the saints we've known the message the ones that really worship God and live the right life we give them a lot of Honor they're the most honorable people it's those stiff starchy people that don't want to worship God they probably got a closet full of like pornography or Abominations or or secret sins or something like that they don't worship God those aren't the people that get honor it's the people that are unashamed to worship Jesus Christ and give Jesus Christ all the glory those people who get anointed by the Holy Ghost they're not ashamed they let God do things in them they thought they never do and that shows God is truly in charge of them Hallelujah ah thank God Amen thank God I want to be one of those people that people honor because I get in the spirit of God I hope I'm there but if I'm not God help me I want to I want to be there by God's grace in fact that guy I talked to on the phone he uh he sent me an email uh Sunday after church or Monday and he said I just want to tell you I'll just read it to you I'm going to chop it up or I'm going to say things that aren't in there my wife knows I can hardly tell a story and get half of it right because I'm a human man remember I was making up that song I'm going to stay in the fear of the Lord remember he said that I couldn't get that song out of my head after you sing that that's good it's either because of bad singing or it's a good song I think it was a good song it's probably bad singing too but where did he say it in here maybe it's the next one oh yeah I am fascinated quote I'm fascinated by how freely and easily you can praise the Lord now think about that I would love to be able to praise him with such gusto that's a new word I never used before and inhibition well God give me some more gusto give me some more Gusto for Jesus Hallelujah I hope he's watching now and Lord bless you sir if he's watching now God give us hearts of gusto see I like that he sees I'm not inhibited to praise God in other words all my channels are cleaned out oh Hallelujah I just said something right there church that was God Amen my channels are open Satan can't stop me from worshiping God because all my channels are cleaned up praise God my conscience oh that's why I come up here and get my conscience cleared out every conscious memory reason affection imagination see uh if you're imagining oh what are people going to think you can't worship God but if you don't care what people think if you can imagine that the angels are watching you worship amen now you're gonna get somewhere huh use your imagination for God hallelujah Hallelujah so this fascinates our worship fascinates people let it continue Jesus not the world it's foolishness to the world right but to them who are of the faith of God it's the wisdom of God it's the power of God and the salvation thank God thank you Jesus oh you didn't like that damn service wait do you see part two Oh Glory and look at Michael she was cursed till the day she died just like Judas she said why you do that waste on Jesus why would you waste that oil I'm not wasting my energy when I'm shouting for Jesus when I'm dancing for Jesus I'm not wasting it I'm actually making the best investment I can make right not only is it helping my physical exercise it's spiritual exercise too all right because they're going to be thankful the next day and the church said I'm gonna have Victory spiritual Victory the next day because I chose to invest my body into the service of the Lord oh just like brothers said if you don't get anything out of service it's because you put nothing into the service if you leave here and you get nothing out it's because you put nothing in ah Hallelujah put some Hardy amens into it or pray after service or go lay your hands on and pray for somebody afterwards if they're praying that they ought to go pray for them put something into it and you'll get more testimonies praise God that's right that's right that's right you get out whatever you put in just like with your physical muscles you get out whatever you put in right same thing with God you're only going to get out of God whatever you put into God you'll reap what you sow so let's plant some seeds tonight praise God spiritual seeds let's plant some Joy tonight some dancing tonight some shouting tonight some amen tonight Hallelujah so I'm going to be faithful I'm going to believe tonight let's plant some fear of the Lord's seeds tonight praise God ah thank God and you'll see it Hallelujah and you'll see the fruit of Eternal last eternal life Hallelujah the fruits of everlasting life but you got a plan Church we got to plant them I've been listening to some of our sermons from 2007 brother the year after we started this church I am amazed at the loudness and the noises and the screaming the shouting and everything I'm amazed like wow our Zeo you think I'm zealous now wait do you hear that I thought I was else no I thought oh my Lord have mercy I'll share the sermons if you want [Laughter] now a lot of them had you know guest guests there you know brother Ray and brother or some other sisters and brothers oh yeah Lorraine okay yeah yeah okay yeah I was thinking about when we first started the church here in Akron but yep yep I agree no doubt about that I'm gonna play Lord willing and next time I preach maybe next Wednesday I'm going to share some of those I want you to hear because if I if I could point you back to a time where I know I was in Revival mode like the first first love Zeal I'm going to point you back to there now I'm doing everything I can now don't get wrong I'm doing everything I can now to stay within that Revival but things are different now I got eight kids now things are a little different now I'm older now I'm more feeble now but see I do everything I can to get to stay in that Revival mode because remember men have died for pushing too hard in revivals Robert Evan Roberts died early because he pushed so hard in the Welsh Revival he just physically was exhausted his body till he died people can do that that's why brother random church people criticized him he had to go out for hunting trips right and these men would pay huge money to send him overseas but he needed that rest all right all right I don't see the burned out and would have lived to 40. 45 or whatever job saw the Wicked dancing and rejoicing with instruments so again the world does it of course we know that but just just so you see it's in the Bible um I love this Psalm a Psalm at the dedication of the House of David so that was when the ark finally got to Mount Moriah right as we preached out not long ago Mount Zion series I will extol thee O Lord for thou Has Lifted Me Up and has made me or made my foes to Rejoice over me hear O Lord verse 10 and have mercy on me Lord be thou my helper thou has turned me I'm sorry that was turned for me my morning into dancing thou Hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with kindness I see church I believe I'm preaching on this for a reason praise God so if we've been mourning we got to say God bring me to a season of Dancing David couldn't have the dance unless he had the morning because he said God did this to me remember he killed Goliath everybody's dancing Hallelujah but then he started getting chasing down for 15 years or whatever 14-13 that was a seasonal Mourning we don't see him dancing we see him acting like he's insane get this insane guy out of here he's got spit all over his beard get this insane where's the dance there right he's afraid for his life the mountains look at the mountain and valleys in David's life such mountains but so deep deep valleys adultery and murder his own son absolutely taking the throne from him but then there's coming to Mountain Church yeah there's coming to Mountain Church I'm saying something their season you have to in order to really dance you have to understand what it's like to mourn and God hallelujah he'll turn that morning into a dance he'll give you a reason to dance absolutely will Hallelujah to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee so the what is all the point of this dancing what's all the point so that God is praised and I will not be silent God doesn't want a silent worshiper now Church there's going to be times when you are and that's okay that's mourning but you need to say God bring me a bring me a garment of Salvation amen bring me a garment a dancer I want to dance and get in the house of the Lord I want to know victory in my life praise God bring me a dancing garment praise God bring me garments of Salvation take away my ashes and give me some beauty praise God I ain't talking about straighter teeth although I got to pay for that yeah what can I do he's talking about giving God the praise getting his Joy back getting his victory back and he did it at the dedication of the House of David it was a dance for a new season of Life how many ever been through a new season of life but Austin came in Lena came that's a new season of life right there brother oh got the dances she's on Hallelujah out of dad and they're back oh my God hallelujah thank God I guess I'm still in that dancing season Glory right thank God but it took a seasonal mourning though to get there took a season in the morning but that's why God does it he does it to teach us remember we must suffer nor that we might obey we have to suffer so then we can help somebody else who suffers with the same thing to be a help to us in the midst or I'm sorry to be helped to them in the midst of their trials here's our text Praise You the Lord sing the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful and occurred in other words worship the one who made you don't ignore the one who made you he made you he knows how you can worship he wants you to worship he made you to worship praise God let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praise unto him with the timber in the heart for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation haven't you seen that a sinner you know you see their pictures and they look so awful and then you see the joy of Salvation on their face picture a picture B right that's what it is beautify the meek with salvation I'm going to hell I hate everybody I can't talk good about anybody I love everybody I hope they all make it to heaven with me praise God beautify them with Deliverance oh Hallelujah you know I've had some college friends and they're of course in a denominational church but I loved it on Facebook years ago his friend my name was his name was Mike good guy black guy good guy from from Columbus he had these pictures like he was like gangster you know he had these football jerseys on he's got chains on he's like giving these signs or whatever and then right next to that he's got his uh picture he's crying he's now a pastor in Columbus and he's crying and works about like I love that he's got the meat he's beautified with the joy of Salvation praise God or he's got a cigarette in his mouth or a weed in his mouth he's got his thug life with his chains and his earrings and then he's there praising God he's weeping crying he's got his microphone he's got his Vibe on his hand I'm like I like that praise God Amen Children Of Darkness has become the children of light thank God let the Saints be sorrowful all day no not verse 5. let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud on their beds that's a trouble We complain on our beds right we speak evil things on our beds right we fear on our beds we cry in desperation well we cry with with no hope we're hopeless on our beds but the Bible said sing to God as you're going to bed Hallelujah ah thank God Amen we all need that church and do like me turn off your phone and set it in the other room don't even take your phone into your room if you don't have to that's what I do now I don't work for everybody but that sure works for me praise God takes pleasure and dance new songs praise oh it might say 15 already next chapter last chapter of Psalms Praise You Lord Praise Him in a sanctuary praise God praise him in his mighty affirming of his power praise him for his mighty acts that's where we got the song Praise Him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him with the Sultry and the harp praise him with the Timber on the dance ah praise him with his strength instruments and organs praise him with the loud symbols praised him upon the highest sounding symbols let everything that hath breath who has breath go ahead and praise the Lord now I said Praise Him amen thank you Jesus you got breath you ought to praise him praise you Jesus praise God hallelujah that's why you got it so you can praise God praise ye the Lord Praise Him amen what was the context of this this was the time and season for dancing he had mourned but now he had peace and victory over his enemies Church you realize David had a time where he just fought tooth and nail for two decades almost but then he finally had a chance no more battles what would that feel like brother no more battles no more going out to battle no external battles Hallelujah and then he could start at that time he started praying I feel led to build a house for the Lord praise God can I do that prophet he said do all that's in your heart Prophet went home have a good night go tell him his he's not going to build it yes sir yes my friend I'm sorry I said that a little too early now actually you're not going to build it you can sort up but your son's going to build it because you're a man of war you shed too much blood this is going to be a house of peace platform for the children or grandchildren go in the rapture we don't know praise God how do we know we got to be faithful win every battle find every battle and let God bring us the seasons of Peace Hallelujah fight battles Hallelujah while you're strong fight him Hallelujah also recognize scenes of scenes the rest we had that remember we talked how we had years of rest right after certain people leave that are criticizing us or whatever we just have these seasons of rest but then guess what we go back into battles so enjoy The Season's arrest because God gives them to you that's the time to really meditate on God that's why I share that if we're not under a mandate for masks and lockdowns well let's enjoy it let's praise the Lord more let's let's spend more time together let's do whatever we got to do praise God Amen let's enjoy it Hallelujah because we got the season to do it to everything there's a season a time and purpose under the heaven verse 4 a time to weep and a time to laugh there's a time to laugh in church a holy laugh not the denominations holy laugh that's that's probably an evil spirit a time to mourn and a time to dance he's made everything beautiful in his time God wants to see you do both church God does God wants to see you dancing but he also wants to see you mourn for people he wants you to experience loss sure right and then you can feel that suffering and then in your scenes of Joy he wants you to feel that Victory you want you to feel like David praise God you want to feel like uh Miriam praise God you want you to feel that praise God so you can look at the Bible and say I'm one of them yeah like brother Brown said he made it he made an identification he said because God's Spirits in me that I was with Elijah Mount Carmel because God's spirit was there on Mount Carmel Hallelujah right in other words the spirit of God that's in me the spirit of God that was in me was also there so another in one way I was there Hallelujah see he was he became one so see he was one of them he was ready for The Showdown now oh because he got the god in him had already been to The Showdown so there's a showdown to come the god that's in me has already been there he's already won it and he'll help me win that Showdown praise God I hope that makes sense by God's grace I don't have a doctorate degree so I can't really explain it the best way you know it's a good thing I don't have a doctor again this is Solomon's end of his life there's a time and season he looked back he said okay there was a time I danced there's a time I mourned he had a lot of more to do at the end of his life for all of his hundred thousand wives yeah I'll tell my wife about that if you calculate a thousand weddings in 40 years he reigned for 40 years that's a wedding every two weeks well honey let's go enjoy our honeymoon yeah hurry up because I gotta get married to this other woman here could we hurry up get back is that crazy of course I don't think I had a wedding for every one of those but it was a type right a type there's one Christ with a many-membered bride Hallelujah it turned out to be awful in the natural but in the spiritual it's a beautiful thing Hallelujah so we can all get leadership from one man amen we can all get the same truth from One Source oh we're all drawing on the same source and the source loves you just as much as he loves me and loves you just as much as you love Brother Ray the same King the same husband the same lord loves us all the same we are his wife we are his body praise God and every part of his body is important and I know there's no good in my days but for a man to rejoice what's dancing all about rejoicing and to do good in his life that's many times while I love dance church I'll just think like I can't believe I danced at all those dances you know for homecoming and prom I made a literal fool myself out there and I want to get that I want to I want revenge on Satan hallelujah amen I want to get it back for Jesus thank you Lord amen hallelujah you know they got pictures of me and all these things out there on the Dance Floor I'll tell you but really those pictures are in the sea of God's forgetfulness you might think you got a copy but really there's no copy of that in heaven there's only copies of this in heaven oh thank you Lord when am I going to come into these notes Here now the Bible said animals dance you know that sure I don't know what satires are seders seders what are seders in the in the Hebrew you want to look it up real quick brother I know they're in Narnia that's all about all I know that's about all I know okay I'll get it here just a second here it's uh Shaggy goat goat oh goat dance like a goat all right it's time to go look at some goat videos now well if the goat can dance surely I can dance right right if a dirty old goat can dance and and praise His maker right then I can dance too Hallelujah thank God could be yeah could be oh yeah oh yeah I've seen people shaking the spirit oh yeah I've seen that oh yeah Saul does it soft shakes Hallelujah the thing is there's liberty in the Holy Spirit that's why I tell the kids at school I said just don't shake your private parts you're good right I mean really you can do everything else just don't shake your private parts and the kids were like okay Mr Smith I'll do that I said let me show you how I do it let me show you I just do this and one there's three kinds of ancient Hebrew dances one of them is just a hop they just hop all over the place it just happened they praise the Lord you know they hop on they're Circle dances I'm gonna get to these hopefully maybe next week they dance in a circle and they got all these steps they do you know right right or they do these you know you can see this they do women dances together it's beautiful when it's done the right way when it doesn't the tree dancing for God will never exalt you won't be like oh let me do this break dance and you can see it I mean I can spin around and do all the that's that's not that's not God that's glorified man but a dance for God will glorify him it's in humility here Israel's promise to dance when restoration comes Church they're going to have a dance the 144 dollars are going to have a dance oh look they go from morning to dancing amen the Bible said they're mourned from house to house how do we kill them how do we kill him he's one of our own but pretty soon they'll get the Holy Ghost and they'll be dancing all over the place saying hallelujah I'm sealed I got the mark in my forehead I'm one of them praise God Jesus says the Messiah I'm dancing God has restored us amen ah Hallelujah after 2 000 years God's restored us the Jew's been blind for 2 000 years and when they recognize Christ they'll say oh oh we now we can see the Messiah we're restored they'll dance and they'll sing they'll praise the lord they're going to really worship God what all we to do because right now we're God's beloved yeah what should we do since God loves us so much thank you Jesus and look he said I have loved thee with an everlasting love church if he loved the Jews how much more the Gentiles do he loved the Jews What About Us we have the baptism Holy Ghost they're blinded they don't have it let's not ever wonder if we are loved we are loved eternally I'm the one he loves Lord just remind me who I am uh Hallelujah thank you Jesus I love this Thou shalt again well that means they were before see this will help anybody if you've been in the season of rejoicing now you're in a morning season you shall again be adorned with eye tablets and shall go forth in the dances of them that make Mary again you're going to get out there again and praise the Lord might not be happening right now but you'll get it again Hallelujah and look you you go join them so you look people are already dancing out there people might already have the anointing but you got to get you got to step in that anointing you got to dance and praise the Lord you got to rejoice in what God's done for you you've got to follow the lead of others who are free to worship God I better close here where where am I here are my notes Here I just got a couple more to go oh yeah here the sin stops dancing so this is why I was saying like people have closets full of sin that's why they don't worship God the way they should that's why I didn't worship God when I was in the dominations and when I first come to message I'll still tune tobacco I was doing other sins I should not have done once I'm embarrassed to admit but that's the reason I didn't have dancing the Bible says our dances turned into mourning woven to us that have sinned that's why people brother that's why people can never really some people can never really get the worship because they never confess their sins all you got to do is say God I'm sorry take this eve away from me and I'm gonna do everything in my power I'm going to make my calling election sure that I'm not going to be addicted to this again well you're gonna get your dance back when the word returns you'll get your dance back I'll say like this when you let the word return right David had to make sure that word come he had to bring it back you've got to bring the word back to your life in the right position of your life we all got to do that whether I'm as excited as I can be for a couple days I appreciate I'm gonna get tired I'm going to sin I'm gonna make a mistake I've got to bring the word back to first place in my life all of us got to do it so we're not I mean you're not alone nobody's here is it alone nobody's here uh is without God's help you have God's everlasting love that's right Hallelujah Jesus's Ministry was compared to uh John Jesus ministry was compared to a gluttonous winebiver I'm sorry they called him a gluttonous winebiver and they compared him to they compared his ministry to piping so Jesus is Ministry in the spiritual was like angels singing people rejoicing dancing praying all the Miracles all the signs wonders all the teaching was just a joyful time but John the Baptist was um came neither eating or drinking yeah more yeah John the Baptist is more of a morning sanctification and uh dedications kind of ministry it was mourning but Jesus's Miracles think of all the Miracles the dead Rays it caused dancing and rejoicing and and all this and that's the imagery that's given see when God does a miracle or God heals somebody we should come to church ready to dance and praise God and just tap me on the shoulder now cause I'm the pastor I can I can put a song request into the song leader and I'm sure he'll sing it yeah or if he's busy I'll sing it you might not like how I sing but you are we ought to just worship God we gotta that's what we need to grow we need to mature and recognize okay this is a season for rejoicing or maybe I'm in the season of tests and trials maybe I'm in the season of losing maybe I'm in the season of getting hey we're in the season of getting let's let's get some worship on hallelujah amen thank God so Jesus doing Mighty Miracles and saving Sinners through Fellowship was dancing spiritually it's like a spiritual dance of course we know herodi's daughter dance alone she did such a wicked seductive dance that the man said I'll give you anything you asked for right what kind of a dance could a woman do to get that kind of offer and we're talking like maybe millions and millions of dollars what kind of a dance and this the Bible said Herod actually observed the prophet John the Baptist look see look how lukewarm he was he could observe John the Baptist but then he could watch this girl dance see that's just a make that's called a make-believer right you know the word is true but then you enjoy sensual things that's a make-believer you got to repent of that become a real believer praise God that's right uh who remembers the first now the first dancing in the Bible was Miriam what was the first dancing in all of history Jesus oh you didn't know that the Bible said the low guys I preached this a number of months ago under the godhead series remember that the logos Rejoice that actual means in the Hebrew the logos danced before the Lord that lick of fire was dancing saying thank you Jesus I'm sorry no thank you thank you Father thank you Father thank you Lord uh the Oneness of God what a mystery huh gory the logos was the Delight of the father rejoicing dancing always before him yeah I just like that little goat like that little Ram just oh I'm so happy oh we're so that's so wonderful it's so sinless here it's holy holy holy holy amen thank God Amen he rejoice in the habitable part of his Earth so that that Pillar of Fire would dance all around creation oh Hallelujah and that was during the foundations of the world that was after God chose you because God chose you before the foundation of the world and the church said see there was dancing after you were chosen the first dancing was Jesus the logos dancing before the invisible father oh brother Jess you just copied that dancing from oh you know brother Ram's tapes or you just got no I actually got it before the foundation or I'm sorry when the world was founded that's where my dancing come from like brother Graham said we didn't copy shouting and dancing from the Devil shouting religion is the oldest religion there ever was because the Bible said the angels of God shouted at the foundations of the Earth all I've got is the same religion the Angels had amen glory not the Fallen Angels the Holy Angels I've got holy religion praise God I know you're getting getting tired I'm getting tired too here so let me find a place to close oh man I just I gotta stop somewhere let me see where I'm at I gotta stop at some point I'll just have to preach a part too um I want to close with this thought here let me uh did I get it yeah I'm gonna close with this thought all nature praises the Lord all nature praises the Lord do they have any I think okay I didn't get a chance to get those scriptures on there okay bear with me here I had him say right here on my yeah I looked up real quick before service like I said I didn't have a lot of time to prepare for this one because it came at the last minute Psalm 65 13 the pastors are clothed with flocks and The Valleys cover with grain they shout and Triumph indeed they sing did you know that the flocks and valleys the Bible says shout and Triumph and they sing I watched the video of that that brother left for us do you know whales sing whales sing we all know birds sing birds in the sky sing their song for you I want to sing thank God Amen I love that song Hallelujah we all know a bird's singing but you know the flocks sing the Valley's covered with grain they shout and Triumph they sing Psalm 4 148 3. yeah we got that praise him all the Angels praise him all of his hosts Praise Him son in the moon the Sun and the Moon praise God sir you think the sun ever takes a break from praising God nor does Jesus praise him all ye shining stars Praise Him highest Heaven you Waters above the heavens let let them praise the name of the Lord for he commanded and they were created Isaiah 55 13. you will indeed go out with joy and be peacefully guided the mountains and the hills will break forth into singing before you and all the trees of the field are clapped their hands Hallelujah he answered I tell you if they were to keep silent the stones would immediately cry out Psalm 19 says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firm and it showeth his handiwork day and today utter speech and night on tonight showeth knowledge there's no speech nor language where their voice is not heard the mountains and the hills break into singing Hallelujah all the hosts praise God I'm gonna close with this I heard a preacher say this I really liked it so I'm gonna close with this a Pentecostal preacher the word dance in Hebrew means to world or go in a spherical a spherical shape so Circle here circular shape right and some of the dances some of the most popular dances we said they go in circular fashion praise God and the Bible says that we were made we were born to praise God we are his we're his creation and church when we actually get in that channel of worship we actually and we're dancing and singing or praising God or you might be whirling in your home praising God I'd like to do that too Hallelujah when you do that you actually join all nature that's already praising God right because the last time I checked the Earth spins all the time right is that right and doesn't it spin around something what is it spinning around and spinning around Christ the Sun hallelujah oh my so when we can finally get our worship in order we can finally get to a season of Dance Hallelujah a season of joy take off the mourner's clothes put on the dancers clothes we actually join all creation glorifying the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah We join him we join him in his creation the birds are singing out there the the trees are clapping out there Why Can't We join them amen we ought to join them amen we've got a soul that's

feet praise God let's join all creation musicians can come Hallelujah thank you Jesus I'm really interested to see what brother Nathaniel preaches on Sunday maybe something about Liberty and the Holy Spirit or something like that oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah Church let's bow our heads here let's pray if there's any sin that hinders your worship let's take care of that we all got it we battle it every day at times right now I'm not hindered by that I've confessed all my sins I'm free in the Holy Spirit praise God Hallelujah I want to give my Creator Glory tonight and just worship God with all you've got because it's not about what other people think of you right like we saw just be ready somebody's going to criticize you eventually but just be ready to say it wasn't about you it was about God if you don't like that wait till I worship God again that's a man after God's Own Heart that's not a that's not a sinner that's a man after God's Own Heart when I get criticized for praising God

Lord dancing for Satan and I'm ashamed of that dear God that's why I'm so glad you brought me through the Red Sea that's all washed away and now I can dance for the right purpose because my Creator made me to praise him my Creator made me to be cleaned out Sanctified made holy and to be a man after my Creator's heart Lord as a church we just want to grow Lord each one's at a different spot Lord God but we just want to grow in Freedom we want to grow we want to recognize seeds of mourning but also recognize seasons of Dancing or foreign as your Prophet said have you experienced that Hallelujah do you like that or we surely like that but Lord if there's any sin hindering any person that would take away their Joy I pray Lord now in Jesus Christ's name they'll confess it May no one leave here with sin until may all sin be put under the blood of Jesus Christ here tonight right Lord God foreign I'm not ashamed of the son of God what's all to be unashamed for the Son of God lord
