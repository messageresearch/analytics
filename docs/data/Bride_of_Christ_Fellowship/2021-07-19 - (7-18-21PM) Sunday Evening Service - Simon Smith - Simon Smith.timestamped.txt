[8:27] really
[8:28] blessed to hear that and i pray it was a
[8:29] blessing it was uh
[8:31] um something that's
[8:34] of all the revelations i've gotten
[8:36] recently in my battles with uh
[8:40] individuals uh
[8:43] brothers who've turned that was probably
[8:46] the most
[8:47] wonderful to me
[8:50] it means a lot giving it getting it from
[8:53] the lord and
[8:55] anyhow this this evening though i'd like
[8:57] to teach on something uh
[9:01] just a real basic something but uh
[9:05] that's on my heart and we just want to
[9:08] be led by the lord you know obviously
[9:09] and uh so we could go to uh revelations
[9:13] two verse one
[9:18] pennsylvania saints all stayed and you
[9:22] guys got a long haul on the way home so
[9:23] we'll bless you guys and
[9:27] i'm sure it's so i don't want to wear
[9:28] you guys out and
[9:30] stretch you guys out or anything but uh
[9:33] appreciate all everybody for showing up
[9:34] and a big crowd here and for me
[9:37] uh revelations 2 let me
[9:40] hear myself
[9:45] the lord's faithful in all things
[9:48] all i see is his hand of grace
[9:50] constantly
[9:52] uh you know the bible says he's a god a
[9:53] much long suffering and
[9:55] surely we found that out and i find that
[9:57] out daily and
[10:02] i have the pleasure recently of working
[10:04] with an apprentice he's a christian
[10:05] newer christian and uh got twin to some
[10:08] things and
[10:10] he always says you're not lying so
[10:12] you're not lying
[10:14] because when he sees it he sees it he's
[10:17] like yeah you're not lying so i was like
[10:18] yeah all right
[10:20] just waiting for me to catch a little
[10:21] more um
[10:24] anyhow revelations two verse one
[10:28] he says unto the angel of the church of
[10:30] ephesus right
[10:31] these things saith he that holdeth the
[10:33] seven stars
[10:34] and his right hand who walketh in the
[10:36] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[10:38] he says i know thy works and i labor and
[10:41] thy patience and how thou canst
[10:43] not bear them which are evil and thou
[10:45] has tried them which
[10:46] say they are apostles that are not and
[10:48] the son of liars that's born and has
[10:50] patience and for my name's sake hath
[10:52] labored and has not painted
[10:54] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[10:55] thee because thou has left thy first
[10:58] love remember therefore from whence thou
[11:02] art fallen
[11:03] and repent and do the first works or
[11:05] else i will come unto thee
[11:06] quickly and remove thy candlestick out
[11:09] of this place except thou
[11:11] repent but this thou has
[11:15] and i call this at home i said this thou
[11:17] has
[11:18] and if there's every uh a little section
[11:22] of
[11:22] churches here that believes in the deeds
[11:24] of nicolaitans the way
[11:25] uh we teach from there i know we believe
[11:29] those things
[11:30] but this thou hast thou has hated the
[11:32] deeds of nicolaitans which
[11:34] i also hate he that hath near letting me
[11:38] hear with the spirit satan the churches
[11:39] to him that overcometh will i give to

[12:24] the word needs to be going a different

[12:46] lord bless them all
[12:48] bless the service in the name of jesus
[12:50] christ
[12:51] you may have your seats um
[12:56] so
[13:01] uh this morning or tonight i'd like to
[13:03] teach on um
[13:06] turning back oh god
[13:10] so i'd like to like to do a little
[13:11] teaching it might be a little simple
[13:12] whatever but uh
[13:14] i trust to be it'll be okay
[13:20] as uh i i was thinking about
[13:23] turning back in uh revelations two there
[13:28] seems to god my mind when i think about
[13:31] turning back and how we're to turn
[13:34] to the lord i think about when i first
[13:37] came into this message
[13:40] i think about all that i was going
[13:42] through at my time period of life there
[13:45] and i think about how
[13:48] miserable i was in denomination and you
[13:50] know you know
[13:51] absolutely nothing saints
[13:56] you don't know what's right you have no
[13:58] idea what scripture
[14:00] means you have no idea what the
[14:03] importance
[14:04] i'll say this of what we have of the
[14:06] prophet you and
[14:07] and i may have said this before here but
[14:09] the importance of
[14:11] the prophet was that now we have
[14:14] someone that could say that this was the
[14:16] absolute meaning
[14:18] of what this means amen because if you
[14:21] go to the baptist they're going to tell
[14:23] you
[14:23] the baptists are going to say this verse
[14:25] and this bible means a certain something
[14:27] if you go to the methodist they the
[14:29] methodist would say this bible means a
[14:30] certain something
[14:31] if you go to the catholic that means
[14:32] they say that the bible is going to mean
[14:34] a certain something or not you might not
[14:35] need the bible at all
[14:37] they're going to say the catechism is
[14:38] what you need
[14:40] so when you're in that kind of a
[14:42] spiritual state when you're that kind of
[14:45] of that kind of an area
[14:48] you you just sit there or you stand
[14:50] there and say what is right
[14:52] what is the truth what is
[14:56] going on so when i we come into this
[14:58] message and
[14:59] and and those in the movement uh sister
[15:01] christian but jesse
[15:03] uh for the amen or brother brother bang
[15:07] brother amen was a little later but
[15:09] brother bang remembers the very
[15:10] beginning of the
[15:11] we have a i have a we have a picture of
[15:13] me brother rang
[15:14] wow we were babies
[15:17] baby babies like yeah we put some weight
[15:21] on
[15:23] yeah i i was blown away when i got that
[15:25] picture from i think you gave that to me
[15:26] picture i can't remember
[15:27] but when we but jesse found it really
[15:30] just he had it
[15:39] so when we receive this word
[15:42] and i believe i i met your wife sister
[15:44] sarah there at a
[15:46] bible believers banquet maybe i think i
[15:48] met you before
[15:49] when i first come in a couple years or
[15:50] whatever i met your cousins really early
[15:52] sister charity sister faith and uh
[15:56] got to meet all them but but when i come
[15:58] into this to this word
[16:01] my instant thought was we are in
[16:04] the book of acts
[16:08] my expectations were to the
[16:11] smooth my thoughts was like this
[16:15] is we have arrived
[16:17] [Laughter]
[16:19] and within the first two weeks i was
[16:21] telling a certain brother i said brother
[16:23] wherever you want to go door to door and
[16:26] start healing the sick and raising the
[16:27] dead you let me know
[16:30] and he gave me this look like and when
[16:32] he gave me that look i was like
[16:34] what does that mean and then as you
[16:37] continue with the coming the service and
[16:40] and meeting the people you realize
[16:41] wow this this message is kind of messed
[16:44] up
[16:44] [Laughter]
[16:46] the truth of the word is there but you
[16:48] find all kinds
[16:51] it's just as it's what you
[16:54] what you find is a lot of good people
[16:57] absolutely
[16:58] and yet you find a lot of good people in
[16:59] the nomination as well but the
[17:02] difference
[17:02] is the people are all battling
[17:04] denomination in this word of god has
[17:07] come they're all
[17:08] battling but the one difference is the
[17:11] word of
[17:12] god the true
[17:15] interpretation of the word of god
[17:19] and as i was thinking about turning when
[17:20] i first come in and
[17:22] how i was so fired up for the lord i was
[17:25] walking
[17:26] from almost complete towns at a time i
[17:28] walked most of florida ohio
[17:30] i walked mostly defiance or part of
[17:32] defiance i just did a couple blocks in
[17:34] toledo
[17:35] uh covered almost all of houghton ohio
[17:39] uh witnessed a little bit uh did quite a
[17:42] few
[17:42] probably a third or half of delta ohio
[17:45] walked that passed out tracks and
[17:47] i was just on fire for the lord
[17:53] very few came in
[17:58] had a lot of battles in the doorsteps
[17:59] there
[18:01] but nonetheless the word of god stood
[18:03] still
[18:04] it stood solid it did not hinder me it
[18:07] did not
[18:08] phase me or whatever but my initial
[18:10] thought was when i come into this word
[18:12] and baptism by brother craig was showing
[18:14] me baptism
[18:16] i said this is so simple i can't wait to
[18:19] show
[18:19] everyone because it's laying right
[18:23] there this is so easy to see brother
[18:25] william i mean you
[18:26] it was by in five verses you can prove
[18:29] what the true baptism is i mean it's
[18:30] that simple
[18:32] and you know what i said man everyone's
[18:34] gonna see this we're
[18:35] my old pastor's coming in this message i
[18:37] mean no one knows about this
[18:40] well guess what
[18:45] no one could see it
[18:48] no one could see it and if they could
[18:51] see it
[18:52] no one cared
[18:56] and now the realization
[19:00] that we are a special people
[19:05] this is not a simple book
[19:09] not just anyone can see this not just
[19:12] anyone can see
[19:13] and read this and understand it not it's
[19:16] not for everybody
[19:17] it is an elected group of individuals
[19:20] you are
[19:22] you might not think you're special but
[19:24] i'm telling you what you are the
[19:26] apple of god's eye you are
[19:29] chosen and elected from the foundations
[19:32] of the world to see
[19:34] things that no one else on the face of
[19:36] the earth can see
[19:38] praise god
[19:41] but what kind of what kind of what kind
[19:44] of person is god
[19:45] looking for though in the entire bible
[19:50] there is one kind of a man that the
[19:52] bible says has a is a man
[19:54] after god's own heart and that's david
[19:57] now as you would have it sights and
[19:59] sounds is doing david next year
[20:02] and i am going by the grace of god
[20:06] i am going to watch it and i'm going to
[20:08] go there
[20:09] and i'm going to sit and watch this
[20:14] because esther got me hooked
[20:16] [Laughter]
[20:18] now but now notice in first samuel 13
[20:22] and 14
[20:23] the bible says but now thy kingdom shall
[20:25] not continue
[20:26] and the lord has sought him a man after
[20:28] his
[20:29] own heart
[20:33] now david was designed this kind of way
[20:36] he if you look at all the rest of the
[20:39] kings whenever one of david's sons or a
[20:41] king from
[20:42] judah or king of israel whatever they'd
[20:44] always compare him back to david
[20:47] and he did not walk in the ways of his
[20:48] father david or he did walk in the ways
[20:50] but not up to so and for
[20:52] he was the standard he was the one that
[20:55] god was the
[20:56] the spirit led the writers of these
[20:59] books to compare him to amen was david
[21:04] but how do you get to be a man after
[21:06] god's own heart
[21:09] you know when saul started getting evil
[21:10] spirits on him
[21:13] and they said bring he said bring in a
[21:14] man with a harp that was ordained of god
[21:18] they brought in david he took the harper
[21:20] and started playing and he was
[21:21] casting out demons with a harp
[21:26] but with that was that his first concert
[21:30] david from a child a youth up
[21:33] you little ones from a youth up david
[21:36] was in
[21:37] at the sheepfold he was a shepherd and
[21:40] he had a harp
[21:41] and he played that heart by himself for
[21:44] hours
[21:44] and hours and hours at a time what just
[21:48] getting in the presence of god by
[21:50] himself
[21:52] out in the wilderness watching sheep and
[21:55] uh i was like this playing before the
[21:57] lord
[22:00] and he had built a relationship with god
[22:04] he would be communing with god as a
[22:07] young boy
[22:10] so much that he'd be playing and a lion
[22:12] would come over and take a sheep
[22:13] and the anointing still owed him because
[22:16] he knew how to entertain god
[22:18] he knew how to worship god he would go
[22:20] and rent the lion and save the land
[22:24] and he'd be playing and a bear would
[22:25] come and steal one
[22:27] but because he was in the presence of
[22:29] god he always glorified
[22:32] god he always was a worshiper of the
[22:35] lord jesus
[22:38] he had victory after victory and god was
[22:42] with him and he was a special designed
[22:46] man like that
[22:50] but he was given for our example
[22:53] he was given for an example
[22:56] of how what we should if there was a man
[23:00] after god's own heart if there was a man
[23:02] after
[23:03] the heart of the lord jesus christ it
[23:05] would be like david
[23:08] so much so that with christ we call the
[23:10] son of david
[23:13] so in other words how are we supposed to
[23:14] be about i'll say like this
[23:16] my brother-in-law brother dustin salmon
[23:19] married my sister betsy
[23:23] and brother dustin's not a real
[23:24] emotional guy
[23:27] but when they first come in to the word
[23:29] of god
[23:30] and they got married right away they had
[23:32] told me one time they would just go
[23:34] and drive the parking lots and they
[23:36] pulled our songbooks out
[23:37] and just sing to the lord
[23:39] [Laughter]
[23:41] in their car just singing to the lord
[23:46] you know what we did on our friday
[23:47] nights and saturday nights when we first
[23:48] come into the word we'd be up to two or
[23:50] three in the morning brother brooks
[23:52] would come out and preach down in fort
[23:53] ohio
[23:54] on a saturday night priest preached
[23:55] freeze to about eight or nine
[23:57] maybe ten and then from ten to about
[24:00] midnight or one we would be in a circle
[24:02] singing for two to three hours
[24:05] all of us would have our song books and
[24:07] you know what our favorite song was
[24:09] i'm one of them i'm one of them
[24:15] i'm so glad they got they got one of
[24:18] them
[24:19] absolutely that was our song
[24:22] and we would sing saturday night after
[24:25] saturday night
[24:26] after saturday night we would do bible
[24:28] studies after the sermons
[24:30] brother craig would teach brother brooks
[24:32] and preach and vice versa and
[24:34] man we were just eating the word we were
[24:35] coming we were on fire for god
[24:44] we'd be worshiping god constantly
[24:47] talking about the word
[24:48] eating we could not get enough bible
[24:50] studies we could not get enough sermons
[24:53] we would go with brother brooks and he
[24:57] would go preach this church and that
[24:59] church in this church and he preached
[25:01] the exact same sermon four times in a
[25:03] row you know what we were there
[25:05] he didn't phase us on sunday nights at
[25:08] outside of this on the weekends
[25:10] we would as soon as i hit friday night
[25:12] and and we all
[25:13] our group there we all said that we
[25:16] lived for the weekend
[25:18] as soon as friday work was over we would
[25:20] drive down to lima and brother brooks
[25:22] would have 15 to 20 young men
[25:23] on his four sleeping bags every weekend
[25:28] did we wrestle we wrestled did we arm
[25:29] wrestle we aren't wrestled
[25:31] did we cut up and joke around absolutely
[25:34] but we loved
[25:35] the lord
[25:35] [Laughter]
[25:39] it was a tremendous golden age golden
[25:42] time
[25:45] but that was my beginning the fire and
[25:48] zeal
[25:49] for god and his word witnessing to
[25:53] everyone in sight
[25:56] and then the last 10 years i've slowed
[25:59] down
[26:01] i have a witness to as many as i used to
[26:04] i lost my
[26:04] zeal what is the part what part what's
[26:08] what's the hard part is you see so few
[26:11] you see everything drying up
[26:15] nobody wants god nobody wants to hear
[26:17] about him very few
[26:18] even listen to you as you witness
[26:30] so what i'm trying to say is i'm not
[26:31] where i used to be
[26:35] but i want to get back to where i want
[26:37] to be
[26:41] and when you bring as you as let's say
[26:44] brother william goes out witnesses or
[26:46] however
[26:46] and a soul comes in and this is this is
[26:49] this is how it works usually
[26:50] as soon as that brother or sister comes
[26:52] in you're going to watch
[26:54] god deal with that young person
[26:56] supernaturally for about a year year and
[26:58] a half
[26:59] and then after that the lord starts
[27:01] pulling away a little bit
[27:02] now he's got to fight for it i've
[27:05] watched it time
[27:06] and time and time again brother mike
[27:09] mccluskey
[27:10] come on into the word there were so many
[27:13] supernatural miracles going on
[27:15] at that time dreams this happened that
[27:17] happened this brother i ran this this
[27:20] almost for a year and a half almost two
[27:22] years god was just boom boom boom boom
[27:24] and then all of a sudden
[27:27] he pulls off
[27:30] he has to let you start fighting for
[27:32] yourself
[27:34] reading the word taking the word obeying
[27:37] it believing it
[27:38] those sort of things
[27:43] now here's another thing he says and
[27:45] when he removed him he raised up unto
[27:47] them a gate
[27:48] of david to be their king to whom he
[27:50] also gave testimony and said
[27:51] i have found david the son of jesse a
[27:53] man after mine heart which shall fulfill
[27:56] all my will what made david different
[27:58] than all the others
[28:00] he wanted to do the will of
[28:03] god alone all he wanted to do was find
[28:07] out
[28:08] the very decisions god had for him to
[28:10] make in life and make the right
[28:14] decisions
[28:19] have we all found our calling
[28:24] do we know what we want to be as far as
[28:25] the lord do you know do we know what the
[28:27] lord wants us to be are there any
[28:30] missionaries in here
[28:32] brothers any evangelists in here
[28:36] any speakers with tongues sisters
[28:38] brothers
[28:39] anyone with gifts of the spirit rolling
[28:41] out ready to go
[28:45] i'm so i'm still waiting on mine too
[28:47] [Laughter]
[28:49] saints of god there are nine spiritual
[28:52] gifts
[28:52] gifts every one of you was born with
[28:55] some of those gifts
[28:57] and we must the saints of god remember
[28:59] what what were those gifts given for
[29:01] to keep this church clean
[29:04] this body clean because satan is
[29:08] either going to rise someone up from
[29:10] within or he's going to bring someone
[29:12] from without in
[29:15] i've watched it happen not here but
[29:18] others
[29:20] but we need the holy ghost to really
[29:23] start dealing now
[29:28] there's only one uh sin
[29:32] really recorded by david and that's when
[29:34] he fell to bathsheba
[29:36] and of course and david comforted
[29:38] bathsheba's wife went into her lay with
[29:40] her and bear a son and called his name
[29:41] solomon the lord
[29:43] loved him now remember as solomon
[29:46] uh was anointed king
[29:52] and the one thing he prayed for was
[29:53] wisdom
[29:55] and god said everything else correct now
[29:58] as
[29:58] as solomon would now be endued with
[30:00] wisdom on high coming straight from god
[30:03] he started to teach and you'll see
[30:05] through his teachings and proverbs a
[30:06] certain thing
[30:08] look what he says here proverbs 2 1
[30:11] he says my son if thou receive my words
[30:14] and hide my commandments with these
[30:16] he says sow that thine thou incline
[30:18] thine ear unto wisdom
[30:20] and apply thy heart to understanding he
[30:22] says yea
[30:23] if thou criest after knowledge he says
[30:26] and lifted up their voice for
[30:27] understanding if thou
[30:28] seeketh her as silver and searches for
[30:30] her as for hidden treasures
[30:32] thou shalt understand the fear of the
[30:34] lord and find the knowledge of god amen
[30:36] in other words
[30:37] saints of god the beginning of all
[30:39] wisdom is the fear of the lord jesus
[30:41] christ amen
[30:42] if we fear a lot of times people
[30:45] will continue just in life and act like
[30:48] this doesn't exist
[30:49] or it doesn't apply for them for that
[30:51] moment or they say well
[30:53] they just kind of like get a little
[30:54] relaxed and let a little bit slip and
[30:56] slide how that
[30:56] that kind of way well cut corners or
[31:00] something like that
[31:02] and now i got a little testimony on that
[31:04] here coming up
[31:06] for the lord giveth wisdom out of his
[31:07] mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
[31:09] now notice he says he says boys he says
[31:11] listen to me
[31:12] i'm going to give you some wisdom look
[31:14] look what he says to deliver thee from
[31:16] the strange woman
[31:19] even from the stranger with flat earth
[31:22] with her words
[31:23] which forsaketh the guide of her youth
[31:25] and forget the covenant
[31:26] of her god he says guys he says watch
[31:29] out brother he says watch out for these
[31:31] women they're
[31:32] strange women notice in proverbs five
[31:35] and three says
[31:36] for the lips of a strange woman he says
[31:38] drop as a honeycomb and her mouth is
[31:40] smoother than oil
[31:43] but her end as is as bitter as wormwood
[31:45] sharp as a two-edged sword her
[31:47] her feet go down to death her steps take
[31:50] hold
[31:50] on hell so all this wisdom is coming to
[31:53] solve and
[31:54] in the main wisdom he says beware of
[31:56] these women
[31:59] proverbs 5 20 and will thou thy son uh
[32:02] wilt thou my son be ravished
[32:04] by us with a strange woman embrace the
[32:07] bosom
[32:07] of a stranger continually
[32:12] warning
[32:14] he says in uh proverbs 6 and 23
[32:17] for the commandment is a lamp and the
[32:19] light the law is a light and reproves of
[32:22] instruction of the way of life
[32:23] to keep thee from the evil woman from
[32:25] the flattery of the tongue
[32:27] of a strange woman thus not after her
[32:30] beauty and thine heart
[32:31] and thine heart which goes right back
[32:32] what to jesus he says
[32:34] if you're lost after a woman he said
[32:36] you've already committed adultery with
[32:37] her in her heart
[32:38] in your heart he says lust not after
[32:41] beauty and that heart lest
[32:42] neither let her take thee with her
[32:44] eyelids
[32:46] for what means a woman is a
[32:48] woman a man is brought to a piece of
[32:50] bread and the adulteress will hunt for
[32:51] the precious
[32:52] life can a man take fire into his bosom
[32:55] and his clothes not be
[32:57] burned look at all this wisdom psalms
[32:59] compiling for us
[33:01] my son keep my words and lay up the
[33:03] commandments unto thee keep my
[33:04] commandments and live in my
[33:05] my law as the apple of thine eye
[33:09] bind them upon thy fingers and write
[33:10] them upon the tables of their hearts
[33:12] saying to the
[33:12] sins of wisdom he says thou art my
[33:14] sister and call understanding my kissmen
[33:16] that they may keep thee from the strange
[33:19] woman time and time and time this wisdom
[33:23] that he prayed for
[33:25] and god was showing him beware of women
[33:29] strange women
[33:32] the mouth of the strange woman is a deep
[33:34] pit he that the of the lord shall
[33:36] fall
[33:36] therein all right runs all the way
[33:38] through proverbs
[33:40] he says my son give me thine heart and
[33:43] let thine eyes observe my ways
[33:45] for a is a deep ditch and the
[33:47] strange woman is a narrow hit
[33:49] she also lieth in weight as for prey and
[33:51] increases the transgressors among
[33:53] men proverbs 23 and verse 33
[33:57] thine eyes shall behold strange woman
[33:59] and thine heart shall utter perverse
[34:02] things so time and time
[34:06] and time again solomon now given
[34:10] given this wisdom he has wisdom he's
[34:12] given this wisdom
[34:15] and god gives it to him and a lot of
[34:17] this message is focused towards
[34:20] with wild women i'll say it like that
[34:23] now now these are his teachings these
[34:27] are his sermons these are
[34:28] proverbs one some of the greatest
[34:31] understandings of the scripture
[34:34] but at the end of solomon's life but
[34:37] king solomon loved many
[34:39] strange women
[34:43] together with the daughter of pharaoh
[34:45] the women of moabites amorites
[34:47] zionites and hittites all these nations
[34:53] even to these in love and he had 700
[34:55] wives princesses three hundred cockman's
[34:57] wives turned away his
[34:58] heart yet he talked against it and
[35:01] taught against
[35:02] and taught against intelligence and yet
[35:04] he partook himself
[35:07] now remember solomon was the first
[35:10] old testament church age messenger
[35:15] he was the type of the first heat
[35:17] another one remember
[35:18] david was a type of christ and then his
[35:21] son
[35:21] what would move right into the first
[35:23] church age of the old testament
[35:25] and notice because of women
[35:29] his heart his divine love for god had
[35:31] fallen now into the pit
[35:32] sure and it came to pass with psalms all
[35:36] that his wives turned away his heart
[35:38] from with after other gods
[35:40] and his heart was not perfect with the
[35:42] lord his god as was the heart of david
[35:44] his
[35:45] father noticed compares right back to
[35:46] daddy sure now
[35:49] what are they trying to say here in
[35:50] general now we're in laodicea
[35:52] in general there is traps out there
[35:58] in 19 1990s
[36:01] when i was just growing up
[36:04] me and brother jess was tempted to go
[36:07] fully into basketball or
[36:08] or just football or track there was
[36:11] sports
[36:12] and you know what's brand fresh new on
[36:14] the scene was
[36:15] video games that hit
[36:19] late 80s early 90s with video games
[36:22] and it was powerful that first mario
[36:25] game was whoa
[36:28] wow atari 2600 that was that was a heavy
[36:31] hitter too
[36:33] yeah but before that what was
[36:38] entertainment
[36:40] you had like that little bouncy ball
[36:42] with some jacks
[36:43] he had board games those sort of things
[36:48] but now in this generation now
[36:52] 2021
[36:55] there are a million outlets
[36:58] there are a million things you guys
[37:00] could get into
[37:02] to divert you away from christ
[37:07] now look at this first pier five and
[37:10] eight now remember
[37:10] the technology was never been like this
[37:12] before
[37:15] maybe before flood maybe greater
[37:18] but not like this
[37:23] if you go on instagram you can become a
[37:24] celebrity
[37:27] if you start a youtube channel you can
[37:29] be a celebrity
[37:30] and make millions of dollars or
[37:32] thousands of dollars or hundreds of
[37:33] thousand dollars
[37:34] tens of thousands however you want to do
[37:36] it you can be well known now
[37:38] an average ordinary girl
[37:43] that's pretty can be famous right just
[37:46] by
[37:47] flashing herself for flesh all over the
[37:49] video
[37:50] a good-looking man or a man that's
[37:52] intelligent can make videos and do all
[37:53] those things and
[37:55] now my brother here does fantastic work
[37:57] uh saving souls and giving wisdom and
[38:00] edifying the bride as the brother in the
[38:03] debate said the for one probably
[38:04] the top uh apologetics

[44:04] wednesday nights sundays because
[44:07] remember
[44:08] these are average people who are
[44:11] professional
[44:12] which means i'm pretty sure they have a
[44:15] full-time job somewhere else
[44:18] and the only time they can compete is on
[44:20] saturdays
[44:21] and sundays
[44:22] [Laughter]
[44:25] saints of god if you can't see the traps

[44:43] lady and
[44:44] i mean this guy's got his back his hat
[44:46] on backwards
[44:48] real deal
[44:51] these guys are doing professional stuff
[45:02] the devil is remember the jesus said
[45:04] broad is the way
[45:06] that leadeth to hell
[45:10] what if one day i'm offered a contract
[45:14] to
[45:14] start in dodge ball and i was like well
[45:17] i'll just give it a try for fun for an
[45:19] outlet for energy for exercise or
[45:20] whatever

[45:24] pretty good
[45:25] and i can catch ball and i don't have
[45:26] the best arm but i can catch the ball
[45:27] and i'm getting people out and
[45:29] man hey you want to go professional
[45:32] that's going to mess my entire life up
[45:34] i'm supposed to teach
[45:36] bible studies oh my goodness
[45:42] in mark 4 and 18 and these are they
[45:44] which are sown among
[45:46] thorns which hear the word of god in the
[45:48] cares of this
[45:49] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[45:52] and the lust of other things entering in
[45:56] choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
[45:58] do you think
[45:59] any of these guys are solid christians
[46:05] full-time jobs probably being
[46:07] professional some kind of athletes
[46:13] now notice here luke 9 and 61 another
[46:16] said lord i will follow thee but let me
[46:18] go
[46:18] first go bid them for well which are
[46:21] which are at home at my house
[46:23] and jesus said no man having put his
[46:25] hand to the plow
[46:26] and looking back is fit for the kingdom
[46:28] of god
[46:31] isn't that what peter and them did as
[46:32] soon as christ was crucified
[46:34] they said what i go of fishing he went
[46:38] right back to the exact same
[46:39] life the back exact same position he was
[46:42] in before the move of god came
[46:44] but jesus had to pull him out amen he
[46:46] saved them twice
[46:48] he called him twice and got him out of
[46:50] that mode amen
[46:51] he was called for something greater amen
[46:54] yes lord sure now
[46:58] now what came to pass is when as they
[47:01] went
[47:01] that he entered into a certain village
[47:03] and a certain woman named martha
[47:05] received him into her house
[47:07] and she had a sister called mary which
[47:09] also sat at jesus feet and heard his
[47:11] word
[47:14] i'm teaching a little about myself here
[47:15] because i get i get caught up too much
[47:16] doing stuff for people
[47:19] i was i was dealing with a brother
[47:20] brother gareth i don't know if you guys
[47:22] met him before but
[47:23] he called me a freelancer because i do a
[47:26] lot of free work you know
[47:27] he's like brother freelancing today i
[47:29] was like no i'm just probably
[47:32] but notice what he says here and martha
[47:34] was cumbered about with much
[47:36] serving and
[47:39] came to him and said lord dost thou not
[47:41] care that my sister hath left me
[47:43] left me alone to serve to serve alone
[47:46] bid her therefore that she
[47:47] help me and jesus answers unto martha
[47:50] martha
[47:50] thou art careful and troubled about many
[47:53] things
[47:54] i feel like i'm in them shoes sometimes
[47:57] many times
[47:59] anybody here else busy with their lives
[48:02] i've got to do this and i've got to do
[48:03] that and i've got to do this
[48:04] we're just running around just running
[48:07] around like a
[48:08] in a whirlwind in the days almost
[48:12] so busy how did life speed up so much
[48:16] from the 1920s
[48:18] how did things get so busy to push
[48:21] and i'll say it like this they're doing
[48:23] it on purpose
[48:25] but johnny if you know i don't know if
[48:26] you know but back when i first started
[48:28] the trades in 2002
[48:29] probably from 2002 to 2010 the pace of
[48:33] the jobs was
[48:34] is a nice moderate pace but right around
[48:37] 2008 2010
[48:39] it seemed like the push the schedules
[48:42] they put on the workers was
[48:44] was twice as hard
[48:47] and i and i think i figured out because
[48:49] many of the superintendents and those
[48:50] high up were getting bonuses if they got
[48:52] it done in a certain time and they
[48:54] they shot the time shorter and they gave
[48:55] them bonuses they got it done in that
[48:57] time
[48:58] but the weight fell on the workers the
[49:01] people who actually had to work
[49:02] and labor and get these things finished
[49:09] now here is a sister and the prophet god
[49:12] called her dilator
[49:19] he says but one thing is needful and
[49:20] mary has chosen that good part
[49:22] which shall not be taken away from her
[49:25] but what about what's martha's story was
[49:28] martha saved
[49:30] what was martha now notice what the
[49:31] prophet god said about martha now martha
[49:34] must have recognized this that what god
[49:36] was god
[49:37] so jesus was god he says although he
[49:40] she had been busy taking care of a house
[49:43] dishwashing and so forth but there he
[49:46] she showed her
[49:48] color crying over her dead brother
[49:52] but when jesus came martha was the one
[49:55] that ran
[49:56] out and was dealing with and prophet the
[49:58] prophet god said he says when two
[49:59] omnipotents meet
[50:01] he called martha an omnipotent and when
[50:04] two of them
[50:05] something must take place
[50:09] she was built as a worker she couldn't
[50:11] help it
[50:13] but when it came time to show who she
[50:15] was
[50:17] she was the one with christ saying lord
[50:20] if whatsoever you say right now can
[50:23] happen amen and
[50:24] she believed it
[50:28] i believe she was put in here for this
[50:30] age because we're just
[50:32] running and running and running hurry
[50:35] hurry hurry get done get done you're
[50:37] done
[50:37] just get it done all right my boss was a
[50:40] master at that my old boss
[50:43] i'd be getting there two weeks late from
[50:44] when the job started and said
[50:46] sorry we gotta get this done i'm like
[50:48] chuck i haven't even seen the prince yet
[50:51] and every day he'd give me a pep talk
[50:56] hey sorry hey we just really need to get
[50:58] shot there
[51:00] yeah i know yeah no but i'm telling you
[51:02] if you just push little by me we've just
[51:03] really got to get this done because
[51:04] we've got this coming up
[51:05] like yeah i know and every day you get a
[51:08] pep talk
[51:09] hey hey we just got it we just got a
[51:10] really good this is a great job but you
[51:12] just got to get it done i mean hey no
[51:13] matter what it takes just get i know i
[51:15] know
[51:15] i know i know i know
[51:19] every day just get it done get done i
[51:22] know i know
[51:24] they're just pushing and pushing and
[51:26] pushing
[51:29] and pretty much soon pretty soon your
[51:31] brain gets calloused
[51:33] and you don't care you know what i say
[51:36] you don't get done when it gets done and
[51:39] you know what jesus christ is saying
[51:41] right now
[51:41] it's going to get done when i get it
[51:43] done
[51:45] you can't hurry me you can't do anything
[51:48] just that he's my one he said then my
[51:50] timing this child will get done when my
[51:52] spirit rises up
[51:53] and he declares it's over amen when i
[51:56] come on the scene it'll get done
[51:58] i'm not dependent on anyone else but
[52:00] myself amen
[52:02] yes lord yeah
[52:07] but there when lazarus was resident she
[52:09] said she showed her colors
[52:12] she really showed what was in her she
[52:13] went to get him
[52:15] immediately a man
[52:19] now are there other true colors
[52:22] hidden in the scripture notice here in
[52:25] john 3
[52:26] here comes nicodemus by night
[52:34] what must i do to enter the kingdom of
[52:35] heaven jesus starts breaking things down
[52:37] and he's just going what
[52:40] i have to enter into my mother's
[52:44] what and jesus said you're a master in
[52:46] israel and you don't know these things
[52:48] he says how can you understand spiritual
[52:50] things you can't understand
[52:53] but something stuck something took place
[52:55] that night with nicodemus
[52:58] the way christ remember he had a meeting
[53:01] he had a conference with christ
[53:04] and when christ spoke i'm telling you
[53:06] when christ speaks it is
[53:07] it it does something to you
[53:11] when you hear the words of the bible
[53:13] something comes off these pages and into
[53:15] your heart
[53:16] the bible says faith cometh by hearing
[53:19] and hearing by the word of god so every
[53:22] time you read this
[53:23] when i read this like this even in
[53:25] silent i can hear myself
[53:26] reading it in my mind but does the faith
[53:29] come immediately no it says it
[53:31] cometh faith cometh by hearing it didn't
[53:34] say when it would come he said it would
[53:36] come amen
[53:36] so if you don't have faith for something
[53:38] right now you just keep reading
[53:40] and hearing and hearing and hearing and
[53:42] saying to god one day
[53:43] that faith is going to strike and god is
[53:45] going to answer your prayer amen
[53:49] yes sure now
[53:53] nicodemus comes to the christ
[53:58] gets a mini sermon and he's just like
[54:01] wow
[54:02] what did he mean there but as we see
[54:06] christ was crucified
[54:08] and after this the crucifixion and after
[54:11] this joseph of arimathea being a
[54:13] disciple of jesus but secretly for fear
[54:15] of the jews he was a
[54:16] secret believer brother joseph
[54:20] he says basalt pilot that he might take
[54:22] away the body of jesus and pilate
[54:24] gave him leave he came therefore and
[54:26] took the bible body
[54:28] of jesus and there came also nicodemus
[54:32] he knew there was something special
[54:33] about him
[54:35] i don't know what he i don't know how
[54:36] many conspiracy friends he lost but i'll
[54:38] tell you what when christ was there when
[54:40] the body was dead
[54:41] he was there taking care of it he showed
[54:45] his true colors right
[54:46] there hey man when the
[54:50] i'll tell you i'll when this squeeze
[54:53] starts hitting you're going to see some
[54:54] secret believers
[54:55] some believers who did not look strong
[54:57] some believers who did not look they
[54:58] were all
[54:59] in all the way but i'll tell you what
[55:01] they're in all the way amen
[55:04] remember sometimes god will well he
[55:06] trained
[55:07] john the baptist for 30 years
[55:10] 30-year training for six months of
[55:12] ministry he trained
[55:13] christ for 30 years for three months
[55:17] three years worth of ministry and he has
[55:19] been training
[55:20] us
[55:23] tell you what i'm saying i i as i look
[55:26] at my spiritual
[55:27] maturity from when i was a christian in
[55:29] 2002 2003
[55:30] wow i was pretty wild i said a lot of
[55:34] things i shouldn't have said and did a
[55:35] lot of things i shouldn't have done
[55:37] looking back i was like man i was so
[55:38] immature
[55:40] but i just came right out of the world a
[55:42] year into the nomination and you're
[55:43] writing the message i was like man that
[55:45] was so worthy
[55:48] didn't even know it at the time i
[55:50] thought i was
[55:51] i thought i was a book of acts man i
[55:53] needed a red pet
[55:54] i had to repent after i just repented
[56:00] saints of god we are god is honing us
[56:04] and honing us and i can and i can see
[56:06] now why
[56:07] you meet a real holy ghost phil the
[56:09] older gentleman
[56:10] and you can see like brother brother
[56:12] michael he says he's an old oak tree
[56:15] just full of wisdom and
[56:17] loving and kind and soft and i'm like
[56:20] man i just
[56:21] want to be an oak tree
[56:25] but god is preparing us he's honing us
[56:28] with the trials
[56:28] within your lives children and work and
[56:32] and dealing with those and each other
[56:33] and all that god is honing you building
[56:35] you ready
[56:36] same with you same with you all of us
[56:39] god he's using
[56:40] your your very uh characteristic various
[56:43] situations in your life
[56:45] to hone you very thoughts
[56:49] doubts he's putting bears in front of
[56:51] you so you can barrel through them
[56:53] jump over them overcome them
[56:56] he's doing that right now for your life
[56:58] i just talked with brother mj
[57:00] and that was putting thoughts like this
[57:01] and thoughts like that and thoughts like
[57:03] this
[57:03] and brother he's just gonna have to
[57:05] barrel through them
[57:07] you've got to we've got all to learn to
[57:09] fight through these mind battles
[57:14] one of the greatest things that ever
[57:16] stuck with me was when brother brooks
[57:18] came and preached at our church
[57:19] and he said he said this one phrase he
[57:21] said he said you
[57:23] are the god of the devil that never
[57:26] left me you know what i do now
[57:31] when i get them thoughts or this and
[57:33] that i tell the devil what to do
[57:35] i said no no i don't hear that and then
[57:38] i started preaching him i said let me
[57:39] tell you something about your future
[57:40] and what your testimony is and the sins
[57:43] you've committed
[57:44] and my sins are forgiven but yours are
[57:46] not forgiven and cannot be forgiven
[57:48] you're going to end up in the lake of
[57:50] fire because the word of god says so
[57:52] i will be up in heaven by the grace of
[57:54] god and by his sacrifice which he
[57:56] provided
[57:57] so what do you talk to me for
[58:04] even now in my house when i see a spider
[58:06] i kill it and i said
[58:08] listen all ye insect inhabitants of my
[58:10] house
[58:12] there is no spiders allowed my house and
[58:15] i just had to say to my aunts yesterday
[58:17] i said there is no ants going to be
[58:18] entering my house there is nothing here
[58:21] to eat you are built for outside
[58:24] spiders too you're a bill for outside
[58:25] and out of my house
[58:27] and i've started commanding them that's
[58:30] my house
[58:31] they're not paying the mortgage they're
[58:34] not paying it
[58:35] they don't have jobs
[58:38] they're not leaving any money so they're
[58:41] not allowed in my house and you know
[58:42] what my spiders have
[58:43] really dropped since i've been speaking
[58:45] that
[58:46] they're not they're not i just killed
[58:48] one in the last five months
[58:50] after this winter it was almost like two
[58:52] a day
[58:53] and they've dropped why just speaking it
[58:58] we have to get the point where we are
[59:00] controlling our atmospheres
[59:02] our households and i know many of you do
[59:04] but we have to get to that point amen
[59:06] now i know it's just kind of basic
[59:09] service
[59:10] he says and take heed to yourselves at
[59:12] any of time
[59:13] less than any time your hearts be
[59:15] overcharged with surviving and with
[59:16] drunkenness and cares this life and so
[59:18] that they come upon you
[59:19] unawares
[59:23] for as a snare or a trap
[59:26] shall it come on all them that dwell on
[59:29] the face of the whole earth
[59:30] watch ye therefore and pray always that
[59:33] ye may be accounted worthy to escape all
[59:35] these things that shall come upon the
[59:36] past
[59:37] and to stand before the son of man i
[59:39] just watched a video of
[59:41] a bible teacher and you know the bible
[59:43] says in matthew
[59:44] i'm sorry luke 17 he says it shall be as
[59:48] in the days of
[59:49] noah and the days of lot and he
[59:52] and jesus said there'll be no sign given
[59:53] to this generation but the sign of
[59:56] jonah there was just a whale that
[59:59] swallowed a man
[1:00:00] this year i think last month
[1:00:04] and he survived he came back out
[1:00:09] they just built the ark down in kentucky
[1:00:12] they built just another one over in
[1:00:13] england and they tried to sail apart but
[1:00:15] they wouldn't give it
[1:00:16] seaworthiness they couldn't sail it
[1:00:20] thanks for god the lord is showing us
[1:00:22] little things here
[1:00:26] about time we're getting close we're
[1:00:28] getting very close
[1:00:29] and then and that was caught by a
[1:00:32] denominational preacher
[1:00:34] that wasn't the message that wasn't a
[1:00:35] message ranks that was the nomination i
[1:00:37] called that i was like whoa that was a
[1:00:38] good catch
[1:00:40] god is showing to them they missed
[1:00:43] the super sign but they are catching the
[1:00:47] other signs
[1:00:47] [Laughter]
[1:00:50] hey man they met they missed malachi 4
[1:00:52] but they sure seeing jonah right here
[1:00:55] oh my yeah um sure now
[1:01:00] now therefore my son be strong in the
[1:01:02] grace that is in the
[1:01:03] christ jesus and the things that thou
[1:01:05] has heard of me among many witnesses
[1:01:07] the same commit thou under faithful men
[1:01:09] that shall be able to teach others also
[1:01:11] thou therefore endure hardness is a good
[1:01:13] soldier of christ jesus christ
[1:01:15] no man that warth entangles himself in
[1:01:18] the affairs of
[1:01:19] this life how do we do this
[1:01:22] how do we not entangle ourselves in the
[1:01:25] affairs of this life number one
[1:01:30] nothing will control you except what god
[1:01:32] has for you to do
[1:01:36] number one starting today on that left
[1:01:38] side jobs or work
[1:01:39] control me
[1:01:44] right if my wife does something i'm not
[1:01:46] going to get mad at her
[1:01:48] i would just go crazy
[1:01:54] when my dog bites somebody i say
[1:01:57] praise god
[1:02:00] when something bad happens i see
[1:02:04] wonderful
[1:02:06] when someone says hey brother psy can
[1:02:08] you do this i pray
[1:02:09] about it and say lord do you want me to
[1:02:11] do this for somebody
[1:02:16] i had probably four or five people maybe
[1:02:18] two or three people in the church call
[1:02:19] me
[1:02:20] to do plumbing in one week
[1:02:23] one guy is sewer backed up another
[1:02:25] brother needed this this this and this
[1:02:26] this all done
[1:02:28] but the day before the brother called i
[1:02:30] got some i bought some plywood off a
[1:02:32] job site for half price the guy made me
[1:02:35] a deal
[1:02:36] i was loading this plywood up and at the
[1:02:39] edge of one of these
[1:02:40] half-inch boards there's a name in red
[1:02:42] written
[1:02:44] dave we got two big d well we got a big
[1:02:48] dave and a medium dave
[1:02:50] and i said i need to call big dave and
[1:02:53] before i even called him on the way home
[1:02:54] he called me says brother i've got a
[1:02:56] plumbing problem
[1:03:00] and i know the lord wanted me to do that
[1:03:01] to help him it took two and a half days
[1:03:02] but we got it done
[1:03:04] up to about 11 12 rolling in the crawl
[1:03:07] space
[1:03:08] with johnny you know how pulling out
[1:03:10] lines cutting lines drain them all
[1:03:12] running all the way back to the septic
[1:03:13] tank digging up the septa tank line
[1:03:16] it was quite the ordeal but the lord
[1:03:19] he was prepping me for it he showed me
[1:03:20] dave all day
[1:03:24] amen so that was an ordained one there
[1:03:27] now now look at this here and if a man
[1:03:30] also strived for masteries yet he is not
[1:03:33] crowned
[1:03:34] except he do it except he strive
[1:03:37] lawfully
[1:03:38] in other words i don't care how good a
[1:03:40] christian you are if you don't live
[1:03:42] the right kind of way it'll be not be
[1:03:44] accepted right
[1:03:46] when i was in college i was not i was in
[1:03:49] like
[1:03:50] division three cross country five mile
[1:03:52] race
[1:03:54] and one race i cut a corner
[1:03:59] but everybody's cutting me for me so
[1:04:01] what i do
[1:04:02] i was not backpack i was not frontback i
[1:04:04] was mid-pack now i just cut the corner
[1:04:05] with them
[1:04:07] and then years later i was coming to a
[1:04:08] certain situation in my life
[1:04:10] and i prayed i said lord why am i going
[1:04:13] through this
[1:04:15] and that night he gave me a dream
[1:04:18] and he showed me in that same race
[1:04:22] doing a certain thing cutting a corner
[1:04:30] so when you cut corners you're not going
[1:04:32] to be rewarded
[1:04:33] it'll hinder you if everyone would have
[1:04:37] everyone to cut that corner in college
[1:04:39] in that race if they would have been
[1:04:40] caught we would all be disqualified
[1:04:45] so we think we're going to heaven or run
[1:04:48] this christian race
[1:04:49] and cut one corner
[1:04:53] if you repent and don't get baptized
[1:04:55] you're not gonna make it
[1:04:57] right and yet know all the mysteries if
[1:04:59] you were pat and you're baptized and do
[1:05:01] not receive the baptism of the holy
[1:05:03] ghost
[1:05:05] you're not gonna make the right though
[1:05:08] you know all the mystery
[1:05:11] we can't cut any corners god help us
[1:05:15] amen now what barnes say about this
[1:05:20] yet he is not crowned except he strived
[1:05:22] lawfully
[1:05:23] in conformity with the rules of the
[1:05:25] games
[1:05:26] no one could obtain the prize unless he
[1:05:28] had complied with all the laws of the
[1:05:31] game
[1:05:32] and had thus given to those of whom he
[1:05:35] contended
[1:05:36] a fair opportunity to succeed in these
[1:05:38] contests
[1:05:39] he who transgressed the rules in the
[1:05:42] least
[1:05:43] matter not only failed of the prize
[1:05:47] even though the apparent victor but was
[1:05:49] sometimes disgraced and punished
[1:05:51] in other words if the man was good and
[1:05:53] yet he missed one thing and he won
[1:05:56] he was disappointed all right
[1:06:00] amen now look at these as brother
[1:06:04] chris hall mastery done 20 years ago not
[1:06:07] everyone that saith lord lord shall
[1:06:08] enter the kingdom of heaven but he that
[1:06:10] doeth the will of my father which is in
[1:06:11] heaven many of him shall say unto me
[1:06:12] lord have we not prophesied thy name
[1:06:15] right
[1:06:15] he says and in thy name cast out devils
[1:06:17] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:06:19] yes i will profess to them i never knew
[1:06:21] you depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:06:24] mark 16 these here's two sets of people
[1:06:27] doing the exact
[1:06:28] same thing one accepted
[1:06:31] and one is rejected what was the
[1:06:34] difference
[1:06:35] workers of iniquity
[1:06:39] what is we all know these what is
[1:06:40] iniquity knowing to do something
[1:06:43] to do it right but not doing it
[1:06:46] not doing it the right way god help us
[1:06:50] amen now hold you almost an hour give me
[1:06:53] a little bit here
[1:06:56] turning back getting back to because our
[1:07:00] whole goal is what
[1:07:02] jesus said he would restore us back to
[1:07:04] the faith of our fathers which was
[1:07:06] matthew mark luke john the book of acts
[1:07:09] that's
[1:07:09] that is our goal and we will not be
[1:07:13] satisfied until we reach that goal we
[1:07:15] are something inside of us says we are
[1:07:17] going to get it i'll say like the saints
[1:07:19] when we think about the word of god and
[1:07:21] going back to that
[1:07:22] i can like visualize i can like see
[1:07:25] myself
[1:07:26] i can see myself running out of here
[1:07:29] just as fast i can
[1:07:30] run into whoever can say sir do you know
[1:07:33] have you been baptized in the name of
[1:07:34] jesus christ do you want to know
[1:07:35] we've got us i mean just excited for the
[1:07:39] gospel
[1:07:41] fearless witnessing to all
[1:07:45] and then what if we could hear the very
[1:07:47] hear the very word the voice of god
[1:07:50] and perform his works with the same
[1:07:53] power and demonstration that christ had
[1:07:56] back there
[1:07:58] that's what we want remember therefore
[1:08:01] for once that would fall and repent and
[1:08:02] do the first works
[1:08:04] evidently something had left their minds
[1:08:07] he says remember
[1:08:08] they have forgotten something he told
[1:08:10] them to turn back
[1:08:11] in their minds to the point of their
[1:08:14] origin
[1:08:15] the origin of the first age was
[1:08:18] pentecost
[1:08:20] right they had fallen from it they had
[1:08:22] forgotten the glory
[1:08:24] and the wonder of it now we
[1:08:27] we can hear tapes of how powerful the
[1:08:30] sermons were in the 50s and 60s
[1:08:33] and the glory and wonder of what it was
[1:08:35] like in those services
[1:08:41] it was time to go back in mind and then
[1:08:44] in reality so it's a mind state
[1:08:48] and that's it it is an expectation
[1:08:52] amen literally our mind we should be i'm
[1:08:55] just going to say it like this
[1:08:57] saints of god every day
[1:09:00] we wake up we go pray read the bible
[1:09:04] and every day we should be praying
[1:09:06] without ceasing
[1:09:08] for the coming of the lord for service
[1:09:11] on wednesday nights
[1:09:13] for service on sunday mornings we should
[1:09:15] be calling each other on saturday nights
[1:09:17] say brother
[1:09:17] get the bed early we got service in the
[1:09:19] morning praise be to god we should all
[1:09:20] be driving here
[1:09:22] and as we enter this should be like oh
[1:09:25] this should be a
[1:09:26] holy reverent place when we enter those
[1:09:29] doors
[1:09:33] we walk trod softly no joking around
[1:09:37] no carrying i mean and i know we're
[1:09:39] people but we should be so reverent and
[1:09:41] holy
[1:09:42] remember if that was like that in the
[1:09:44] old testament
[1:09:45] and then new though we have more
[1:09:49] liberties
[1:09:50] in the new we should have even more
[1:09:52] reference to what it is
[1:09:54] living such a high life but i'm telling
[1:09:56] you what it takes the anointing
[1:09:58] it takes the holy ghost to live that
[1:10:00] kind of life
[1:10:02] the times when i've lived that kind of
[1:10:05] life is when the holy ghost was
[1:10:07] i felt the anointing on me let me tell
[1:10:09] you it's different when you don't know
[1:10:10] he's there or you can't feel him to when
[1:10:12] you can feel him
[1:10:13] all right was like this
[1:10:17] brother william if i know you're
[1:10:19] watching me
[1:10:21] i'm going to conduct myself a certain
[1:10:22] way
[1:10:25] and probably a little over extreme
[1:10:30] but when you're out of sight i'm just
[1:10:32] gonna be me
[1:10:34] you know but christ has all seen
[1:10:40] amen we have to get conscious
[1:10:43] of the unrecognized presence of god
[1:10:48] he is watching all the time
[1:10:51] he is listening all the time before the
[1:10:54] prophecy
[1:10:55] our thoughts are louder in heaven than
[1:10:57] even our words
[1:11:00] i'll help us
[1:11:03] i know this scene a jumper and shout out
[1:11:05] but i'm telling this just
[1:11:07] and maybe it's for me which muslim
[1:11:11] he says now back when you could say for
[1:11:13] me to live is christ
[1:11:16] back to purity when ananias and spy were
[1:11:18] dealt with
[1:11:19] back to the gate beautiful oh my
[1:11:21] goodness when the lame man was risen
[1:11:24] he says oh we're approaching this to
[1:11:25] drift from god into
[1:11:27] and uh countenance those things those
[1:11:30] acts that defile his name
[1:11:33] let those who name his name depart from
[1:11:35] sin and keep their vessels pure for god
[1:11:38] look at once you what uh you once were
[1:11:40] in your heart
[1:11:41] and mind in your life and then go back
[1:11:43] to it
[1:11:45] amen brother johnny when you first come
[1:11:47] into the word you were raised the
[1:11:48] message right
[1:11:49] no so when you come and heard this word
[1:11:52] how did you act
[1:11:56] yeah when you first come as a christian
[1:11:58] and did you have more zeal than you had
[1:12:00] now
[1:12:04] yeah me too absolutely
[1:12:08] bang were you on fire 20 years ago
[1:12:12] yeah me too
[1:12:16] brother jess has been pretty consistent
[1:12:20] i don't know he's got he's i he
[1:12:22] definitely needs god's grace but tell
[1:12:24] you what he's
[1:12:25] he's chosen one number four
[1:12:28] okay now so if we can like
[1:12:32] positionally like i said this morning
[1:12:33] from this hour from this moment
[1:12:36] get our mindset back to this was fresh
[1:12:40] go back to when you heard this is right
[1:12:42] here was raised the message right
[1:12:43] but when you first really realized what
[1:12:45] you had what was it like
[1:12:47] that first baptism of the holy ghost it
[1:12:49] had to be
[1:12:50] it became real it was no longer mom and
[1:12:54] daddy going to church and
[1:12:55] said oh my goodness jesus wants
[1:12:57] something to do with me
[1:13:01] now what is the way back the way is the
[1:13:04] way of repentance now here's a burner
[1:13:06] this was hard for me
[1:13:08] if a sinner has come to god by a way of
[1:13:11] repentance
[1:13:12] then the lukewarm or backslider will
[1:13:15] have to repent that much more oh
[1:13:18] god have mercy
[1:13:22] this is a year of this is the year of
[1:13:23] the altar for me
[1:13:25] amen praise god
[1:13:28] repent bring forth its first fruits meat
[1:13:30] for repentance prove it by your life
[1:13:33] if you do not repent god said i'll
[1:13:34] remove your can't lampstand certainly a
[1:13:36] church that is in that condition cannot
[1:13:37] give light to the world
[1:13:39] he says its light has turned to darkness
[1:13:41] god will then
[1:13:42] take away his faithful messenger and his
[1:13:44] faithful shepherds
[1:13:45] and leave them to themselves and they
[1:13:47] will go on talking about christianity
[1:13:49] but be bereft of it hey that's that's
[1:13:52] not where you want to be
[1:13:56] amen now in closing
[1:14:01] uh let's stand here
[1:14:07] dealing with ephesus it came the point
[1:14:09] that it says they did not repent
[1:14:14] fact he said there was not even one
[1:14:15] christian left in that city
[1:14:17] and the lamp was rent from its place now
[1:14:19] it doesn't not mean that she
[1:14:21] could not have repented it does not that
[1:14:23] mean that we cannot repent we can but it
[1:14:25] must be quickly
[1:14:27] it must be a true heart cry to god and
[1:14:30] sorrow
[1:14:32] and then god what and then god will
[1:14:34] restore
[1:14:39] everyone everyone want to be a joel 2
[1:14:40] army
[1:14:42] the wall will fire round about you
[1:14:46] and army before or after
[1:14:50] leaping over whatever kind of walls and
[1:14:53] jumping into windows whatever that means
[1:14:55] anybody want to be
[1:14:57] joel 2 i want to be in that army
[1:15:00] and you know how the bible says to get
[1:15:02] to that army it says we must
[1:15:04] repent get out of the laodicean grind
[1:15:09] that attitude that's
[1:15:10] just all the way just
[1:15:13] every day you know what charles finney
[1:15:16] said
[1:15:17] would take a revival he said each one of
[1:15:20] us
[1:15:21] needs to close up our shops for six
[1:15:23] months
[1:15:24] quit your jobs for six months and just
[1:15:27] meet the house of god
[1:15:28] all day long and praying fast he said
[1:15:31] and then you'll have a revival
[1:15:38] how many are willing to do that that was
[1:15:42] late 1800s
[1:15:48] finney had a 98 percent the salvation
[1:15:52] keeping rate too
[1:15:53] of all this converts 98 of them stayed
[1:15:58] that's powerhouse that is the power of
[1:16:01] god on a man then when he spoke one word
[1:16:04] things would take place
[1:16:06] in the late 1800s he was that serious
[1:16:11] for us to live is christ
[1:16:14] amen besides that hard how we can do
[1:16:16] this i have no idea how we're going to
[1:16:18] do this
[1:16:19] but he said he would have a church
[1:16:22] amen now he says again god will restore
[1:16:24] and the glory will come again
[1:16:28] i want to read one more quote here for
[1:16:29] you as we close here
[1:16:32] now look at this satan told eve
[1:16:36] eve believed it all but just a little
[1:16:38] bit and he told her
[1:16:40] they just take all of it but just a
[1:16:42] little bit
[1:16:46] might be go to the pool it might be
[1:16:48] something else you just got to take it
[1:16:49] every bit
[1:16:50] just the way it is here see just the way
[1:16:52] it is said here
[1:16:54] i'm i'm guessing you're talking about
[1:16:55] the word might call you to do some first
[1:16:58] works over again but it's just what the
[1:16:59] word said this was satan's trick since
[1:17:01] he worked on the first
[1:17:03] to just disbelieve a little bit of the
[1:17:05] word
[1:17:07] in other words let me say it like this i
[1:17:08] was thinking about this back there to
[1:17:10] disbelieve just a little bit of the word
[1:17:12] if there's a blind man right here
[1:17:17] for the maokai can god heal that blind
[1:17:20] man
[1:17:24] can you go over there and lay your hands
[1:17:25] on and heal the blind man
[1:17:28] ah that was different jesus can do it
[1:17:34] but man my life's not perfect
[1:17:37] can i do that if i pray over that blind
[1:17:40] man
[1:17:40] will god heal it can god heal it oh yeah
[1:17:43] absolutely all of us can agree
[1:17:44] god can heal that blind man right there
[1:17:48] but sister huh can you go over there and
[1:17:50] pray over that and god heal it
[1:17:55] coming down to the rubber meets the road
[1:17:58] well johnny
[1:17:59] if you reach out your long arms over
[1:18:00] there standing in that same position and
[1:18:01] touch that blind man
[1:18:03] will god heal it through your anointing
[1:18:06] by your prayer
[1:18:09] and you know how humans brother
[1:18:12] william's like
[1:18:14] so the william goes on praise oh i'm
[1:18:16] right behind that i'll lay my hands on
[1:18:17] brother william and we'll both pray
[1:18:18] but i'm believing that god's gonna
[1:18:20] answer his prayer not mine
[1:18:24] we all believe god can do anything but
[1:18:27] can god do anything through you
[1:18:31] will god hear my prayer do i have enough
[1:18:35] faith
[1:18:36] for it just that little bit
[1:18:40] we all believe that god's god probably
[1:18:42] the lord jesus christ can do anything
[1:18:43] at any time to anyone for anything
[1:18:47] but can he use you
[1:18:52] lydia blind guy go pray over him i'll
[1:18:54] turn my back like this
[1:18:56] well god answer it
[1:19:00] yes you believe that
[1:19:03] we have to have our faith believing all
[1:19:05] the word
[1:19:08] if you ask it shall be given to you in
[1:19:10] prayer
[1:19:12] how many have desires things we need
[1:19:14] fixed in our lives
[1:19:16] things we need answered
[1:19:19] ask and shall be given to you well i
[1:19:22] have enough faith to pray for
[1:19:24] uh brother amen but i don't know about
[1:19:26] my life but i believe god's gonna do
[1:19:28] something for you
[1:19:31] your life as well do we believe this all
[1:19:34] of it and it shall be given and it shall
[1:19:36] then say when it shall be given
[1:19:40] seek and ye shall find
[1:19:43] i need to know god in a way i've never
[1:19:46] known him
[1:19:47] cause he would find him knock
[1:19:51] and it shall be opened
[1:19:55] do you believe that saints of god these
[1:19:58] are absolute powerhouse scriptures these
[1:20:01] things come on
[1:20:02] this scripture here can unlock anything
[1:20:05] if we had a revelation if you believe
[1:20:07] that god was going to answer
[1:20:08] your prayer and your desires
[1:20:12] our joys would be overflowing
[1:20:15] sure now a little bit here
[1:20:20] last last quote what's the matter with
[1:20:23] the tabernacle
[1:20:24] a man ought to be able to say when when
[1:20:26] you meet a man
[1:20:28] is your christian experience when was it
[1:20:31] that
[1:20:31] is your christian experiences when was a
[1:20:34] dearest
[1:20:35] dearest to you you ought to be able to
[1:20:37] say
[1:20:38] right now now notice what this
[1:20:42] he says well notice what this man says
[1:20:44] well my best
[1:20:45] experience was back when i first got the
[1:20:47] baptism of the holy ghost when i came
[1:20:50] what brother bam say about that oh
[1:20:52] brother
[1:20:53] you've fallen from
[1:20:57] you mean to tell me that the first time
[1:21:01] you received the baptism of the holy
[1:21:02] ghost
[1:21:03] and you hang on to that one experience
[1:21:07] and for 20 years say that was it i've
[1:21:10] fallen from grace
[1:21:14] we should have more refillings as thanks
[1:21:17] to god
[1:21:17] as we reach more and greater spiritual
[1:21:20] maturity
[1:21:21] stasher of perfect man anyone here
[1:21:23] busting to a vision lately
[1:21:26] the bible says that if you i think it's
[1:21:29] uh
[1:21:30] it says if you i'm just gonna paraphrase
[1:21:33] but if you live clean enough the very
[1:21:34] angels of heaven will visit your home
[1:21:37] anyone living clean enough the angels
[1:21:38] are visiting your home homes
[1:21:42] are we living in the presence of god
[1:21:44] brother cam went got an invitation to
[1:21:45] preach up in canada
[1:21:46] the man had two churches after service
[1:21:49] the holy ghost came down in service
[1:21:51] after service the man went to the
[1:21:52] deacon's house but it came with dean's
[1:21:53] house
[1:21:54] he said brother the presence of god was
[1:21:56] there
[1:21:58] first time he's ever experienced it he
[1:22:01] said you could feel the presence of god
[1:22:02] the entire time you're in the house
[1:22:05] everyone can feel it
[1:22:09] angels angel visitations
[1:22:12] because we live so close close to god
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:18] o israel return unto god thy god for
[1:22:21] thou has fallen by what
[1:22:23] iniquity there's things we know we
[1:22:25] should do
[1:22:27] we get lazy but ram said he says i don't
[1:22:29] wake up and pray like i should because
[1:22:30] i'm lazy
[1:22:31] i get william branham gets tired simon
[1:22:33] smith gets really really tired
[1:22:36] absolutely anyhow all hearts minds clear
[1:22:38] for tonight
[1:22:40] saints of god i really believe we're at
[1:22:41] a time when we have to start
[1:22:43] if we have not purposed in our heart to
[1:22:46] start
[1:22:46] turning and changing and letting all
[1:22:49] this laotian stuff go
[1:22:52] especially this guy we've got to start
[1:22:55] now
[1:22:56] it's got we should have started we're
[1:22:58] far behind
[1:23:00] the denominations we're far behind i'll
[1:23:03] say this
[1:23:03] the the the worldly the sa even the
[1:23:06] satanic
[1:23:07] they're in spiritual realms i mean bad
[1:23:09] ones but they're
[1:23:10] they're in their spiritual realm we it
[1:23:12] seems like
[1:23:13] like the prophet said she's just
[1:23:14] staggering she's just we're moving so
[1:23:17] slow
[1:23:19] but god's going to get us there everyone
[1:23:21] believe that i
[1:23:22] feel all right let's just lift our hands
[1:23:24] a little bit here and
[1:23:25] stretch out and just anyone need prayer
[1:23:29] if you desire a closer walk the lord

[1:23:50] want to we want to think about the lord
[1:23:53] talk about him and he will draw near
[1:23:57] david got into the presence of god by
[1:24:00] entertaining god
[1:24:02] all the time thinking about him
[1:24:04] worshiping him
[1:24:07] he was so in the spirit that his songs
[1:24:09] were prophetic
[1:24:12] it brought forth the future
[1:24:16] you know david's sing that song is why
[1:24:18] uh uh why would we sing songs and we're
[1:24:20] in babylon that was even before the
[1:24:21] captivity
[1:24:23] that's prophetic
