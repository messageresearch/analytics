[0:29] tribulation
[0:30] uh the Bible said there the tribulation
[0:32] will be such a time there's never been
[0:34] like it and never will be there's been
[0:35] hurricanes before there's been
[0:36] earthquakes before much more devastating

[2:13] humble prayers Lord God we know Lord God
[2:16] only two or three are required Lord God

[2:20] the Lord they shall be heard Lord God so
[2:22] we're reminded of your precious promises

[2:36] that prayers might be answer Lord we
[2:38] humbly ask it by the grace of God
[2:40] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:42] and your righteousness alone we ask that
[2:44] these things could be done in Jesus
[2:46] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[2:49] God bless you as you're being seated
[2:50] praise
[2:51] God hallelujah so I just want to look at
[2:54] this verse just for a brief moment you
[2:55] know this verse uh said she speaking of
[2:58] Hagar called the name of the Lord that
[2:59] spake to her thou God seest me
[3:03] Hallelujah she said thou God that's the
[3:06] uh Hebrew word God is L right which
[3:08] means the
[3:10] almighty uh the powerful one the strong
[3:13] one is another way to say that she said
[3:16] uh the strong one sees me now the Greek
[3:18] word there is Roy El Roy and this is uh
[3:23] uh the God who sees the strong God who
[3:26] sees Hallelujah so we want to look at
[3:28] this thought here just briefly here with
[3:30] the God who sees praise the Lord you
[3:33] know just briefly looking at the life of
[3:35] uh Hagar uh you know we first learn
[3:39] about here here in Genesis 16 she's
[3:42] introduced as an Egyptian maid servant
[3:45] uh to to
[3:46] Sarai uh wife of Abram uh and we
[3:50] remember that Sarah is baren and uh she
[3:53] takes upon herself to try to bring this
[3:56] promise to pass so she says uh husband
[3:59] uh take our our servant take our slave
[4:01] or I say servant would be a better one
[4:04] take our servant here and know her so
[4:07] that I can bring forth a child that
[4:09] would be a customary thing of those days
[4:11] if if the wife couldn't bring forth the
[4:12] child uh she would have uh a maid
[4:15] servant uh lie with her husband and and
[4:19] then and then the wife would would raise
[4:21] that child as it was her own so this was
[4:23] the custom of the time and of course
[4:25] this wasn't the will of God this was uh
[4:27] their own thinking they went against the
[4:29] the will of God they tried to bring a a
[4:31] promise to God to pass by their own
[4:33] selves and each time that happens it's
[4:35] always trouble praise God any time we
[4:37] try to make the word of God come to pass
[4:39] or uh I'll just say like this we try to
[4:42] be presumptuous and try to make things
[4:44] happen on our timetable instead of God's
[4:47] it always causes trouble or as you'll
[4:49] know later it always causes a wild thing
[4:52] to happen right because what came out of
[4:53] this a wild man an ishma right right an
[4:56] ishma came out and uh as you know you
[4:59] know all all the different uh Israelite
[5:01] tribes have all intermarried and moved
[5:03] and gone around so there there there's
[5:05] no real there's no really one nation
[5:07] that we would say are all Israelites um
[5:09] but the Nations that probably contain
[5:11] the most Israelites would be Saudi
[5:12] Arabia Jordan Yemen or Yemen I never say
[5:15] that right but really Church anyone who
[5:18] attacks Israel would be the ishmaelites
[5:21] right the wise men I'm sorry the wild
[5:23] men not wise men the the foolish men uh
[5:25] it'd be the wild men who are attacking
[5:28] uh the Bible say they persecuted uh the
[5:31] promise the the the children of the Bond
[5:33] woman persecuted the child of the
[5:35] promise right so anyone persecuting the
[5:37] Jews today so we know Hamas would be the
[5:39] Wild Man Group right uh anyone that's
[5:42] against Israel Iran and different
[5:44] nations that are uh constantly attacking
[5:46] Israel those are the wild men of today
[5:48] thank God that we're not wild thank God
[5:50] that we're tamed down thank God that we
[5:52] can learn cons control can I say like
[5:54] this self-control we can learn
[5:56] Temperance by the Holy Spirit praise God
[5:58] that we don't fight against one another
[5:59] another we love and encourage one
[6:01] another right that's how Israelites were
[6:04] known they would fight against other
[6:06] people we'd been looking at you know
[6:07] Wars and and you know in the churches
[6:09] right stripes and things like that
[6:11] that's not the nature of a Christian the
[6:12] nature of a Christian is peace that
[6:14] passes all understanding
[6:16] Hallelujah but we see this is you know
[6:19] where uh ishmail gets the start
[6:22] Hallelujah and uh and and then you know
[6:24] she gets pregnant she brings forth the
[6:26] ishmail and then after she brings forth
[6:28] ishmail Sarah begins to despise Hagar
[6:32] and mistreats her and uh Sarah confronts
[6:36] Abraham or Abram with Hagar's attitude
[6:38] and and Abram gives her permission do
[6:40] whatever you want with her right in
[6:42] Genesis 16 and and uh s Sarah really
[6:45] mistreats Hagar harshly so look at this
[6:48] even a person in the Hall of Fame of
[6:50] Faith could have troubles and and human
[6:52] frailties to mistreat people so don't be
[6:56] discouraged you ever mistreated somebody
[6:57] just look for more grace Hallelujah
[7:00] because Sarah that that's what the Bible
[7:02] records about her right she wasn't
[7:04] perfect neither was Abram we went
[7:05] through Abraham's mistakes last year
[7:07] right we had a whole a whole list of
[7:09] them all the good but all the bad too
[7:11] amen and so we can see that that she
[7:14] gets upset and then whatever treatment
[7:17] this was we're not told what it was
[7:18] maybe you know they we've we've seen
[7:19] dramas where she maybe slapped Hagar or
[7:22] whatever whatever she did it caused her
[7:24] to Hagar to run away in the wilderness I
[7:27] don't know what would cause you to run
[7:29] from your home but probably physical
[7:31] abuse
[7:32] right and goes out alone in the
[7:35] wilderness
[7:36] right this causes her to do such a a
[7:39] thing to leave uh where she was and to
[7:42] flee in the wilderness but then
[7:43] graciously the angel of the Lord finds
[7:45] Hagar by a spring in the desert and
[7:48] tells her to return to Sarai and to
[7:51] submit to her Authority so see we can
[7:54] see that Hagar wasn't completely sweet
[7:56] and
[7:57] submissive right so it wasn't like she
[8:00] was helping Sarah you know with uh being
[8:02] so sweet and tender all the time cuz the
[8:05] angel says you have to submit yourself
[8:08] right so we can see there's wrongs on
[8:10] both sides usually that's how it is
[8:12] right if you're amongst Believers now
[8:13] Hagar became a believer in the Lord I
[8:15] don't we don't know to the extent she
[8:17] continued to be a believer but she
[8:19] certainly heard from God as we'll see
[8:22] and then the in Genesis 1610 through2
[8:24] you know the angel Lord also made a
[8:26] promise to Hagar that her descendants
[8:28] would be numerous and she'd bear a son
[8:30] who'd be called ishmail God hears and
[8:33] but he's prophesied to be a a wild man
[8:35] and he would have conflict with others
[8:37] right especially uh the true seed of God
[8:40] the true seed of Israel Hallelujah and
[8:42] uh then Hagar names a place where she
[8:44] meets this Angel she meets an angel and
[8:46] she calls us uh beer la la Hoy R Ria I
[8:51] say that wrong every time but I'm trying
[8:53] my best and it means The Well of him
[8:55] that liveth and seeth me acknowledging
[8:57] God's awareness of her situation so
[9:01] she's all by herself in the wilderness
[9:02] uh she she feels like she has nowhere to
[9:04] go and God shows up and God shows Mercy
[9:08] to her Hallelujah ever been that ever
[9:11] been in that place where you feel like
[9:13] maybe you've been rejected you've been
[9:14] mistreated by even church
[9:16] members even uh even the elect you've
[9:19] been mistreated by the elect And yet
[9:21] when you're all alone look at this
[9:23] church even when you feel like you're
[9:24] alone you're never alone hallelujah amen
[9:27] you might feel like you're forsaken but
[9:29] you're not forsaken Hallelujah because
[9:32] God sees Hallelujah we see this plainly
[9:34] that that in Genesis uh
[9:37] 16 Hallelujah I think I read the wrong
[9:40] yes no 1613 yes that even in 1613 she
[9:43] said it's God uh who's seen me she's
[9:46] been all alone but she says God has seen
[9:49] me right now look Church even when
[9:51] you're mistreated God sees you but see
[9:53] God let you go through the mistreatment
[9:55] why to teach you to trust in him
[9:58] Hallelujah and church let's not forget
[10:00] many times we have to suffer so we learn
[10:03] obedience it's hard for us to remember
[10:05] that but we have to remember that even
[10:07] Jesus had to suffer to learn to obey
[10:10] Hallelujah now he never disobeyed that
[10:12] that's the that's the difference with
[10:13] him he was holy he was blameless he was
[10:15] harmless amen the Son of God hallelujah
[10:17] but we're not holy all the time we're
[10:20] not harmless all the time and the church
[10:22] said hallelujah we're not harmless all
[10:24] the time we want to be we we try to be
[10:26] Lambs gentle like Lambs wise as serpents
[10:28] harmless as doves we try to be that but
[10:30] we're not always that way sometimes we
[10:32] mistreat others but still Church even in
[10:35] in in in the midst of our trials God
[10:37] sees us and the point I want to make
[10:39] here God even sees uh the Bond
[10:43] woman look at that she wasn't the the
[10:47] the the woman of Promise Sarah was the
[10:49] promised
[10:50] woman and if God sees the Bond woman
[10:53] surely God sees you hallelujah how many
[10:56] believe you're a child of the promise
[10:58] the promise of Jesus Christ the Messiah
[11:00] right and the Rapture and all and the
[11:02] and the Millennium and the future home
[11:04] we believe we're children of that
[11:06] promise we're not going to be the
[11:08] children of the of we're not going to be
[11:09] the children that are left behind in the
[11:11] rapture we want to go in the Rapture
[11:13] praise God we're not going to be the
[11:15] people that miss the Millennium right we
[11:18] want to be a part of the people that
[11:19] rule in the Millennium praise God even
[11:21] if we're the least of those in the
[11:22] Millennium that we want to be one of
[11:24] those Hallelujah God help us to be just
[11:27] the very least if not whatever whatever
[11:29] God has God help us just to be there
[11:31] praise God never exalting ourselves or
[11:34] trusting in ourselves but trusting in
[11:36] the grace of God we're aware that we uh
[11:39] as the message Believers following God's
[11:41] Prophet brother brandham we've been
[11:42] given a special Revelation I was raised
[11:45] in the Pentecostal Church some of God I
[11:47] never heard anything like what I heard
[11:49] when I come to hear God's Prophet
[11:50] brother bradam so I know and I'm sure
[11:52] you do if you're raised in denomination
[11:54] you know we're a special blessed people
[11:57] by the grace of God hallelujah not by
[11:59] our works but by the call of God
[12:01] hallelujah like when I was in
[12:03] denomination I never heard hell was not
[12:05] Eternal right but it makes no sense how
[12:08] can a person live eternally unless they
[12:09] have eternal life it doesn't make any
[12:12] sense in denomination I never heard God
[12:14] was one person but that's what the Bible
[12:15] says God is one person Jesus is the
[12:18] express image of God's person Hallelujah
[12:21] I never even heard about the Millennium
[12:22] or the future home uh for 18 or 19 years
[12:26] growing up I never heard about that I've
[12:28] heard about the power of God thank God
[12:29] I'm thankful for what I heard about but
[12:31] when we came to the message we heard
[12:32] greater things I never heard about the
[12:34] wise and foolish virgins until I heard
[12:36] brother the random the anointed on to
[12:38] the end times amen and that's what
[12:40] brother Irvin asked me in the car he
[12:41] said brother Jesse what does that mean
[12:43] false Christ it means they're false seed
[12:46] in other words they're lost but they
[12:48] have the genuine anointing at times like
[12:51] balum ba the Bible said balum went to
[12:53] hell but he also had the genuine
[12:54] anointing at times to prophesy about the
[12:56] Star of David Caiaphas probably went to
[12:59] hell right but he had the right
[13:00] anointing to say one man must die for
[13:02] the whole nation Hallelujah and then
[13:06] those in Matthew 7 uh they cast out
[13:08] Devils they healed the sick they did all
[13:09] these things but Jesus said I never knew
[13:11] you he never denied that they didn't do
[13:13] the Miracles and Judas Judas did all
[13:16] those uh uh he healed the lepers raised
[13:18] the Dead cast out Devils every demon
[13:21] Spirit was subject to judas's scari but
[13:23] he was lost a son of
[13:24] predition and so Jesus said there be
[13:26] many false christs so see Church what we
[13:29] need is we need the Christ and we need a
[13:31] true Christ amen we need a TR true
[13:34] anointed one we need people that are
[13:36] saved we need to be saved and we need to
[13:38] have the right anointing as well
[13:39] Hallelujah that's what we need today
[13:41] Hallelujah That's What attracted me to
[13:43] this message the the anoint the ones in
[13:45] the end time uh the serpent seed uh the
[13:48] true water baptism in the name of Jesus
[13:50] Christ not titles father Son and Holy
[13:52] Ghost amen but that there's one name to
[13:54] the father son Holy Ghost that's the
[13:56] name Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah
[13:59] right now we see it we we're just we're
[14:01] blessed Children of the promise so we
[14:03] got to be uh we got to be faithful to
[14:05] what God's called us to be at the end of
[14:07] Genesis 16 Hagar returns to Abram's
[14:09] household and gives birth to ishmail
[14:11] when Abram's 86 years old ishmail grows
[14:14] up in Abram's house for about 13 years
[14:16] or
[14:16] so and then in chapter 17 God get renews
[14:19] the Covenant with Abram tells him it's
[14:21] going to come through Sarah but she's
[14:23] going to change her name to Sarah right
[14:26] but finally in Genesis 21 Sarah or SAR
[14:29] Bears Isaac and the Bible said they
[14:31] laughed because God made them to laugh
[14:34] they laughed at the beginning with
[14:35] unbelief but God makes them laugh with
[14:37] joy at the end that's what God does
[14:40] right God will give you a promise it
[14:41] might seem impossible you might laugh at
[14:43] it say oh it's impossible but God will
[14:45] make you believe it if it's his word
[14:47] hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen
[14:51] and uh she was 90 Sarah is 90 Abram was
[14:54] 100 then in Genesis 21 uh you know Isaac
[14:57] is made fun of by ishma and uh Sarah
[15:01] kicks him out I'm sorry kicks her out
[15:05] and uh God Abram Abraham goes to God and
[15:08] God says listen to what Sarah says right
[15:10] that's the time Brothers you know
[15:11] sometimes God will tell you listen
[15:12] listen to what your wife is telling you
[15:14] to do right Hallelujah but the man's
[15:16] ultimate leader right but there are
[15:17] times where God will give the direction
[15:19] the right move to the wife praise God
[15:21] there are times but the man is the head
[15:24] Hallelujah no no problems there by God's
[15:26] grace the trouble is if the woman's
[15:27] making all the decisions all the time
[15:29] that's that person's probably off the
[15:30] word of God right that man's not leading
[15:32] like a man should lead Hallelujah right
[15:36] so Abraham gets distressed but he God
[15:38] says listen to Sarah Sarah kicks him out
[15:41] and Abram gives them little Provisions
[15:43] right and they begin wandering off into
[15:46] the Wilderness in Genesis 21 and then
[15:48] haggar's in despair remember the story
[15:50] he's probably 13 14 year old boy and she
[15:52] can't she can't stand to see her son die
[15:55] of thirst of dehydration so she puts him
[15:58] under a bush walks away church I just
[16:01] want you to be uh mindful again God
[16:04] cries out uh uh God hears the cries of
[16:08] ishmail Hallelujah and the angel Lord
[16:10] calls to Hagar from heaven and Comforts
[16:13] her and reiterates the promise and says
[16:15] Israel be become a great nation and then
[16:18] the Bible said God opens her eyes to see
[16:21] the water I like that amen sure
[16:23] sometimes it's it's sometimes the
[16:24] problems with us we're not seeing things
[16:26] the way we need to see things praise God
[16:29] God may have something right there for
[16:30] us but we got to have our eyes open so
[16:32] we can see the promise of God church we
[16:35] can trust God hallelujah how many are
[16:37] encouraged that the God who sees saw
[16:40] Hagar
[16:42] twice see that she was all alone we'd
[16:45] say all deserted seemed like life was
[16:47] over seemed like there was no hope but
[16:49] who saw her God saw her both times
[16:51] Hallelujah and she wasn't even in the
[16:53] promise and if God sees someone who's
[16:55] not in the promise God will surely see
[16:57] you and I in the promise say amen that's
[17:00] why I'm bringing that out it's the God
[17:02] who sees he sees each person Hallelujah
[17:05] the Bible said God would that that no
[17:06] man be lost God would that all men be
[17:09] saved now we know very few will find it
[17:11] but it's God's desire that each would
[17:13] receive it praise God hallelujah so
[17:16] Hagar twice is given this this
[17:19] Revelation she sees that God sees me if
[17:22] God ever makes a promise God will bring
[17:24] it to pass hallelujah
[17:27] amen God Watches Over Us
[17:30] Church uh and if God saw Hagar then
[17:33] certainly he'd see Abraham Abraham's
[17:36] seed right Abraham Isaac Jacob he
[17:38] protected them right down to Moses
[17:41] Joshua Samuel David Solomon Esther
[17:44] Daniel Ezra Nehemiah Malachi John the
[17:46] Baptist he saw them through all the time
[17:49] God never took his eye off the promised
[17:50] seed did they have struggles yes but who
[17:53] they have they had the God who sees

[18:22] Victoria anybody younger than Victoria
[18:24] been

[18:28] 8 years old God sees her as part of the
[18:31] promise she's been baptized how many
[18:34] know her sins are
[18:35] remitted and she shall receive the gift
[18:38] of the Holy Ghost amen for This Promise
[18:41] she's a child of the promise Hallelujah
[18:44] she's a child of the the promise of the
[18:46] Covenant praise God and if God sees
[18:48] Hagar twice outside of the Covenant God
[18:50] will surely see us inside the Covenant
[18:53] Hallelujah just be encouraged El Roy
[18:56] amen El Roy the God who sees God is
[18:58] watching us tonight
[19:00] Hallelujah he's always watched over his
[19:02] promised seed amen he can't take his
[19:04] eyes off his chosen people how many
[19:06] believe that tonight Hallelujah doesn't
[19:09] always seem like it but his eyes are
[19:12] upon us praise God now we know Ishmael
[19:14] grows up later becomes uh a great
[19:16] Archer Hagar gets a wife for him from
[19:19] the Egypt Egypt land so of course she
[19:21] wasn't you know wasn't say she wasn't
[19:22] part of the promise you know
[19:25] um and ishmael's descendants are
[19:28] listening the Bible said they were great
[19:30] in number and so they are today right
[19:32] millions and billions of Israelites we'd
[19:34] say Arabs right that are against the
[19:36] Jews millions of them but we learned
[19:38] these great points about
[19:40] Hagar God cares for the
[19:43] outcast Hallelujah if you felt Outcast
[19:46] or deserted God's watching
[19:49] you remember brother Austin let's not
[19:51] forget Austin's testimony Austin would
[19:53] sometimes sleep at the parking deck at
[19:55] akan
[19:56] University he'd sometimes sleep in
[19:58] little Fe s down there and did God ever
[20:00] take his eye off him absolutely not and
[20:03] look look at him today look at him when
[20:04] he comes up and sings Psalms see church
[20:07] God has his eye on you and I hallelujah
[20:11] praise God as far as he was gone he's
[20:13] not here but you know his testimony he
[20:15] shared it on podcast as far as he went
[20:16] in drugs and different decisions he made
[20:19] God's eye was never off him because God
[20:21] knew someday he's going to come back and
[20:23] he's going to be worshiping in the house
[20:25] of the Lord hallelujah he couldn't get
[20:27] out of God's eyes cuz he's part of the
[20:30] Covenant he's part of the promise let's
[20:32] don't let's not forget you and I are
[20:34] part of that Promise Too
[20:36] hallelujah
[20:39] amen see and look at she obeyed God in
[20:42] such a little way she just obeyed the
[20:44] angel and went back and submitted
[20:46] herself see church sometimes it's just
[20:48] hard for us to submit to what God wants
[20:49] us to do but look what she did she
[20:52] humbled herself a little woman who
[20:54] really didn't even have a husband she
[20:56] probably felt like her husband abandoned
[20:57] her right right but it wasn't like the
[20:59] full legitimate marriage of a
[21:02] husband but see God honored her
[21:05] obedience and so when she was in great
[21:08] need God came and helped her out because
[21:11] God saw her Hallelujah so see obey God
[21:14] cares for the outcast God o God honors
[21:17] your obedience God honors your faith and
[21:20] then God kept his promise to
[21:22] ishmail and then of course God showed us
[21:24] that God helps us survive and God gives
[21:27] us strength God opens our eyes when we
[21:30] don't see how it's going to work out God
[21:32] opens our eyes so we can see Hallelujah
[21:35] is that right God had to open her eyes
[21:37] so she could see the water to give to
[21:40] her son that her son's life would be
[21:43] spared
[21:44] Hallelujah church I want to look let's
[21:46] look at this verse here's another verse
[21:47] to see how God looks at our problems uh
[21:50] Exodus 14:24 would you pull that up
[21:52] there hun this just blessed me as I Was
[21:53] preparing this scripture just come to me
[21:55] I was reading it a couple weeks
[21:57] ago so Israel had already come out of uh
[22:00] Egypt church and they were coming to the
[22:02] Red Sea and I want I want you to see
[22:04] what the Bible says it came to pass that
[22:07] in the morning watch the Lord looked
[22:10] unto the host of the Egyptians through
[22:12] the pillar of fire in the cloud and
[22:15] troubled the host of the
[22:18] Egyptians Church they had that Pillar of
[22:20] Fire going before them but what was God
[22:22] doing it's like God's eyes was in that
[22:24] Pillar of Fire and God in other words
[22:27] God saying I'm staring down your enemies
[22:29] I see your enemies and I'm going to give
[22:31] them
[22:32] trouble Hallelujah but they had the wait
[22:34] for the right time God's our deliverer
[22:38] if we'll follow the pillar of fire amen
[22:41] are you with me Church follow the pillar
[22:43] of fire if we follow the pillar of fire
[22:45] God will look through that Pillar of
[22:47] Fire he'll look at our enemies he'll
[22:48] stare down our enemies and he'll say
[22:50] this mountain is H has to move
[22:52] hallelujah it's going to move and didn't
[22:54] he move them Church did he move them or
[22:57] not they had to wait they got a real
[22:59] uncomfortable situation but God had to
[23:02] uh Moses Cried Out wh uh Lord what's
[23:04] happening and God said why cry speak and
[23:07] go forward amen another time he said
[23:09] stand still and see the salvation of God
[23:12] hallelujah sometimes God has you stand
[23:14] still right brother Rod he'll just have
[23:15] you stand still and wait other times God
[23:18] will say speak the word that's why
[23:20] church when we come to church we got to
[23:21] see what the holy spirit's prompting us
[23:23] to do it won't always be speak the
[23:26] word sometimes God wants you to wait and
[23:28] suffer a little more so you learn to
[23:30] obey
[23:32] Hallelujah right you know like I told
[23:36] you before we've had people say brother
[23:37] Jer speak the word this brother J why
[23:38] don't you speak the word right I can't
[23:40] speak the word unless God's telling me
[23:42] to speak the
[23:43] word and then when people say that
[23:45] they're the ones that they don't speak
[23:46] the word when they go through trials
[23:48] well how can God be telling you to tell
[23:50] me to speak through trials when you
[23:52] never speak through trials it's kind of
[23:54] like you still got a moat in your eye
[23:55] you got to pick out of there right
[23:58] you're trying to tell me how to overcome
[23:59] my trials when you have all these other
[24:01] trials and you don't overcome them the
[24:03] way you
[24:04] should oh I love it amen but see God is
[24:08] looking at our enemies God is the one
[24:11] who has he is his eyes on the whole
[24:13] situation God was watching them even
[24:16] when uh uh the brick making got hard God
[24:19] was watching them the Bible said God
[24:21] heard their prayers their cries for 400
[24:24] years God heard their
[24:25] cries and God waited 400 years so again
[24:28] I preached that a few months ago church
[24:30] God may let us suffer God may let us die
[24:32] we don't know what's going to happen but
[24:34] no doubt God hears every prayer we pray
[24:38] Hallelujah right to say that he doesn't
[24:40] would be to doubt him would be to doubt
[24:42] his infinite power but we know God is
[24:45] all powerful amen he's Elroy God sees me
[24:49] praise God but God has a plan and God's
[24:51] going to bring a certain generation at a
[24:53] certain time to do a certain work we
[24:55] hope it's us that we get to miss death
[24:57] and go to meet Jesus in the air but we
[24:59] don't know but God sees us anyhow praise
[25:02] God hallelujah we hope and pray we're
[25:06] that generation who gets to skip death
[25:08] but we don't know but El Roy is still
[25:12] alive and well today Hallelujah because
[25:14] El Roy became the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:17] that's right amen El Roy put on flesh
[25:21] amen that's right
[25:24] Hallelujah now let's look here I don't
[25:27] think I'll be too terribly long long
[25:28] tonight here we'll see I don't know you
[25:30] never
[25:32] know uh let's look at a few things here
[25:34] I want you to see here let's look at
[25:35] Matthew 24 verse 5 6 7 and
[25:38] 8 Jesus was constantly watching people
[25:42] so when Al Roy uh left the pillar of
[25:44] fire and he came behind flesh then the
[25:47] spirit of God was in Christ remember the
[25:49] fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ
[25:51] bodily God was in Christ reconciling the
[25:54] world to himself how many can say Amen
[25:55] to that God came and dwelt in Christ to
[25:58] reconcile himself unto God
[26:03] hallelujah so Matthew 245 we put up five
[26:07] for many shall come in my name saying I
[26:09] am Christ and shall deceive many is that
[26:11] the right one no it's 23 I'm sorry H not
[26:14] my my fault yeah I wrote down the wrong
[26:15] one I'm so sorry I wrote down the wrong
[26:18] chapter it's 23 four five six S8 forgive
[26:20] me
[26:21] hun that's it's just being in a hurry
[26:24] but all their Works they do to be seen
[26:25] of men see now what religion people
[26:28] listen church God help
[26:30] us God help us religious people just
[26:33] want other people to see them but real
[26:37] Christians just want God to see them
[26:40] real Christians like I don't care what
[26:41] anybody else sees I want God to see me
[26:44] that's what Jesus tells about these
[26:46] religious people the only reason they do
[26:48] religious works is so other people will
[26:50] see them so they don't have a real
[26:52] private secret life with Christ it's
[26:55] only just coming to church or going out
[26:57] public and people can praise them oh
[26:58] look at you did look you're you're such
[27:00] a great person they just want the praise
[27:02] of men they don't want the Praises of
[27:04] God so notice and Jesus watch Jesus is
[27:07] watching this he would go in the markets
[27:08] he'd watch the Pharisees the Sadducees
[27:10] herodians uh he'd watch all of them they
[27:12] make broad their fies and enlarge the B
[27:16] borders of their garments and love the
[27:18] uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief
[27:21] seats in the synagogues and the
[27:23] greetings in the market and to be called
[27:25] of men Rabbi Rabbi or teacher teacher
[27:27] but be not be not called Rabbi for one
[27:30] is your master even Christ and all ye
[27:33] are Brethren so I want you to see this
[27:35] Jesus watches why we're doing the things
[27:37] we do why do we pay tithes why do we pay
[27:39] offerings why do we go to church why do
[27:41] we pray why do we fast why do we give
[27:43] alms why do we do all these things Jesus
[27:46] is watching and he he's watching us the
[27:48] God who sees he sees why we're doing it
[27:51] may our motives and objectives be
[27:54] pure because these guys got to a spot
[27:57] where alls they did did was Works to be
[27:59] seen of men not for God to see them they
[28:03] just wanted to be greeted out in public
[28:04] or in the church they didn't really want
[28:06] to be seen by God because if they wanted
[28:08] to see by God they would have kept some
[28:09] some of these things a
[28:11] secret okay so Jesus was watching where
[28:13] they sat when they went to fellowships
[28:15] right what they wore the greetings that
[28:18] they would get he would watch how they
[28:20] greeted one another oh there's my great
[28:22] Pastor there's my the great preacher
[28:24] there's the great don't call anybody
[28:25] great there's only one great that's God
[28:29] God you've seen it right guest preachers
[28:32] come in everybody shake their hand a
[28:33] certain way now it's okay to show honor
[28:35] respect but then another preacher maybe
[28:38] not as popular come in and nobody just
[28:39] really talks to him because he's maybe
[28:42] older maybe he's not as handsome as the
[28:43] older guy you know maybe he's not as
[28:45] rich as the other guy right you've seen
[28:47] a brother Rod right you know but people
[28:49] just it's all about the outward
[28:51] appearance but God is looking at the
[28:53] heart
[28:54] Hallelujah God's looking at the Heart
[28:56] Church
[28:58] I like this one in Mark chapter 2 uh go
[29:01] to verse three this is where uh it's a
[29:03] beautiful story where uh they're in
[29:05] Peter's house Jesus and Peter's house
[29:07] and they can't get in so that they have
[29:09] to pull or drop a man down through the
[29:10] ceiling I want you to see this and they
[29:13] come unto him bringing one sick of paly
[29:15] which was born of four he was one of
[29:17] four children and when they could not
[29:19] come nigh unto him for the Press they
[29:20] uncovered the roof where he was and when
[29:22] they broken up they let down the bed
[29:24] whereever the sick of the py lay verse 5
[29:27] when Jesus
[29:28] saw their faith he said unto the sick of
[29:31] the py son thy sins be forgiven thee so
[29:34] just leave that up there for a moment I
[29:36] just love this Jesus was standing there
[29:38] he was just standing there sitting there
[29:39] the whole time he was just letting them
[29:41] manifest their
[29:43] faith their sick friend was was was in
[29:46] awful condition and Jesus just let them
[29:48] God was in him so God just moved him to
[29:51] just watch and just watch what people do
[29:54] when people are sick God's watching how
[29:56] we treat the sick Hallelujah everybody
[29:59] see that Jesus is watching do we help
[30:02] the sick do we help the poor and if we
[30:05] do what does Jesus see he sees our faith
[30:09] because faith is your works and your
[30:10] love of God expressed right Faith Works
[30:14] by love so love Faith Works if you have
[30:17] love it'll give you faith faith will
[30:19] produce works so see this is El Roy
[30:23] praise
[30:24] God he sees our works Hallelujah he sees
[30:27] our our religious actions he sees us uh
[30:30] if we're in the promise if we're not in
[30:31] the promise God sees us everywhere
[30:34] Hallelujah and God wants to minister to
[30:36] our needs but we got to be faithful to
[30:38] him Hallelujah now here's the one I love
[30:41] I love this one Luke 21 verse1 this I
[30:43] love this
[30:46] story and he looked up and saw the rich
[30:49] men casting their gifts in the treasury
[30:50] verse
[30:51] two and he saw also certain poor Widow
[30:54] casting in thither too much I just leave
[30:56] that up there a widow right
[30:58] so not exactly Hagar but very similar
[31:01] she don't have a husband right and Hagar
[31:04] her husband wasn't with her right you
[31:06] know Abram it just wasn't exactly a full
[31:08] marriage more like a concubine
[31:10] situation but see God is there God in
[31:14] flesh is looking at the woman he sees
[31:16] her he lets all the rich people give
[31:19] their offering but then God sits there
[31:21] and lets this poor Widow who remember
[31:23] has no source of income that's any
[31:25] substantial income if she does
[31:28] I I need to go through that through the
[31:29] Bible and see what widows did for money
[31:31] how did they were they just they uh I
[31:33] know Paul told them to take care of
[31:35] widows who are widows indeed who are
[31:37] praying and fasting and and so forth uh
[31:40] they had to be proven now think of that
[31:43] church think let's apply that to today
[31:45] if there was some sister in our church
[31:47] that didn't have a husband right she's a
[31:49] widow if we apply that today I'd have to
[31:51] look at that sister if she needed help
[31:53] I'd have to say are you praying and
[31:54] fasting before I can help you now which
[31:57] on of us would really think about that
[31:59] that's what Paul said they have to be
[32:01] widows indeed and he said not the women
[32:03] that will run out there and try to get
[32:05] married real real fast a young man or
[32:07] something like that so just look at that
[32:09] there are requirements for people to get
[32:11] financial help in the church
[32:13] widows right look at that but I love
[32:17] this Jesus he just he lifs lifts up his
[32:20] head and he watches people give their
[32:22] offerings and he sees this Widow two
[32:25] mites if I'm not mistaken that was two
[32:26] fifths of one penny but I could be wrong
[32:28] on that I feel I feel like that's what I
[32:30] remember from my studies okay verse
[32:33] three and he said of a truth I say unto
[32:35] you this poor Widow hath cast in more
[32:38] than they
[32:39] all verse four why because all these
[32:42] have of their abundance or their extra
[32:44] money cast in under the offerings of God
[32:46] but she of her penury hath cast in all
[32:49] the living that she had so she gave all
[32:53] of her income the rich people just gave
[32:55] a very small percentage of it and look
[32:58] at that church Jesus let her do it Jesus
[33:01] didn't stop and say no sister no sister
[33:03] you keep your last two pennies no Jesus
[33:06] let her do that why because the Bible
[33:08] tells us the Bible tells us God loves a
[33:11] cheerful Giver
[33:12] Hallelujah God loves that and no doubt
[33:15] God was going to pay her back in
[33:17] Proverbs the Bible says if we lend to
[33:19] the Lord the Lord will pay us back well
[33:21] her she was poor already you know if we
[33:23] give to the poor we're lending to the
[33:25] Lord and the Lord will pay us back well
[33:27] how much more will Jesus pay her back
[33:29] Hallelujah with some some great blessing
[33:32] praise God and Jesus just stood there
[33:35] and he saw and he let her Express her
[33:37] faith amen Church don't you know
[33:39] sometimes your trials are are are
[33:42] allowed so God can help you and God can
[33:44] watch you and watch if you express your
[33:46] faith or
[33:48] not do you have faith that in your
[33:50] darkest trials you'll still give your
[33:52] tithes and offerings and I'm not
[33:54] preaching on money tonight I'm just
[33:55] that's just the example right
[33:58] in your deepest trial will you still be
[34:00] faithful to God's word if your marriage
[34:03] is on the rocks will you still be
[34:04] faithful to your husband or your
[34:06] wife if your child's uh run running
[34:10] sinful or or things like that will you
[34:12] curse them and call them serpent seed or
[34:14] will you pray and intercede and try to
[34:16] bring them to Christ Hallelujah you know
[34:18] just in your darkest hour God will
[34:21] sometimes step back and just watch I'm
[34:23] just watching my daughter here manifest
[34:25] the word of
[34:26] God I'm just watching my son here
[34:29] manifest the faith that's in his heart
[34:31] hallelujah praise God that's what Jesus
[34:33] did he just stepped back and let this
[34:35] woman Express her faith I know God's in
[34:38] control I know God owns the cattle of a
[34:40] thousand hills and if I get my last two
[34:42] dollars God will pour out a blessing
[34:44] upon me praise God that's Faith El Roy
[34:49] the God who
[34:50] sees he sees your religious acts he sees
[34:53] your giving right Hallelujah he sees
[34:56] your faith praying for the the
[34:58] sick Jesus would stand back and just
[35:00] watch them what are they going to do
[35:04] Hallelujah that's what's happening now
[35:06] right God's watching what we're going to
[35:07] do when our friends are in
[35:08] hurricanes right or people we know are
[35:10] suffering don't have money don't have
[35:12] food or clothing or water something we
[35:14] hear about it God's watching what are we
[35:16] going to do with our
[35:17] faith I think one of our children said
[35:19] boy we're really thankful to live in
[35:20] Ohio and I said Amen to that but that
[35:23] doesn't mean we should we should stop
[35:25] our and and and and close up our vows of
[35:28] compassions the Bible says the Bible
[35:30] said we should open up our hearts and
[35:32] have compassion on others
[35:36] Hallelujah Jesus watched her sacrifice
[35:40] all she had to express her trust in God
[35:44] hallelujah how many know God's watching
[35:47] you tonight God's watching me tonight
[35:50] he's El Roy the God who sees Hallelujah
[35:54] and God will bring his word to pass
[35:57] Hallelujah
[35:58] God sees
[36:00] us now let me uh look at a few verses
[36:03] now I'm just going to kind of go real
[36:04] fast here uh like a machine gun here I
[36:06] should say like that God is completely
[36:09] watchful of Our Lives he sees every
[36:12] detail of Our Lives Psalms 121:3 says he
[36:15] will not suffer thy foot to be moved so
[36:18] in other words if your foot gets moved
[36:19] God allowed it he that keepeth the will
[36:22] not Slumber God doesn't go to sleep on
[36:24] you behold he that keepeth Israel shall
[36:28] not neither sleep nor slumber nor sleep
[36:30] I'm sorry slumber nor sleep so God's not
[36:32] sleeping when you're going through tough
[36:34] times God's watching
[36:37] you all of us got to fall asleep
[36:39] sometimes and we can't be faithful like

[45:15] finish up here by God's grace El Roy how
[45:19] we love
[45:21] him church I think we see such
[45:24] compassion in Jesus uh I want to leave
[45:26] this one uh up here uh in times like
[45:28] this you know when people are asking me
[45:29] is this a tribulation things let's
[45:31] remember John
[45:32] 14:27 let's remember this all I still
[45:36] got a little bit more to go here peace I
[45:38] leave with you my peace I give unto you
[45:40] not as the world
[45:42] giveth now most people to get peace
[45:44] today they got to go get drunk or get on
[45:47] marijuana or get some Vapor that's how
[45:49] they get peace but Jesus said I'm not
[45:52] leaving you that I'm leaving you my
[45:55] peace not as the word World gives give I
[45:57] unto you let not your let don't let your
[46:00] heart be troubled don't let it be afraid
[46:04] so if Jesus is telling us that we
[46:05] shouldn't do this then he must have
[46:07] power to help us to do it right and he
[46:11] does it's called the holy
[46:13] spirit amen it's called the Holy Ghost
[46:15] amen I know a ghost amen I know the Holy
[46:19] Ghost Hallelujah that's right I know the
[46:21] Holy Spirit and he says not to fear I'm

[46:27] Age
[46:30] Hallelujah he sees us and he leaves us
[46:33] his
[46:34] peace you know as I'm coming down here

[46:43] school friends and different ones that
[46:44] 92 year old he's just going to stay so
[46:45] we'll pray for him but she also said I
[46:47] had numerous high school
[46:49] friends they tried to leave but couldn't
[46:52] because all the gas in Florida is in
[46:54] that area it's all up it's all used up
[46:57] and if they leave they run out of gas
[46:59] and she said she saw on her news and the
[47:01] apps and Facebook so some of her friends
[47:04] can't leave because it's like there's
[47:05] cars just stranded all along certain
[47:08] highways because they can only make it
[47:09] so far and she said there's numerous
[47:11] families with children just walking
[47:12] along the road she said it looks like
[47:14] it's a it's a a war
[47:17] zone so what do you do in those moments

[47:41] be she said would you pray for them yes
[47:44] I'll pray for them Hallelujah we'll pray
[47:46] for them by God's
[47:48] grace see there's people going through
[47:50] difficult
[47:51] times right in the midst of us and we
[47:53] have to remember that God sees them and
[47:56] it's our duty to pray for them
[47:58] Hallelujah that's why we're here that
[48:01] why do we have it better because God
[48:02] wants us to pray sometimes we might not
[48:05] have it better for our whole lives we
[48:06] don't know but while we got it better we
[48:08] better pray for them
[48:10] Hallelujah like the Bible says remember
[48:12] if you remember the part of the body
[48:14] that's suffering then if a part's
[48:15] suffering everybody should suffer with
[48:17] it if everyone's rejoicing let's Rejoice
[48:19] with them let's remember them Hallelujah
[48:22] as they go through their struggles like
[48:24] I said a dear precious friend said are
[48:26] we in the tri
[48:28] I said certainly not we're not even
[48:29] close to the tribul I mean these
[48:30] conditions are not even close to the
[48:32] tribulation uh let's read Revelation 8
[48:34] let's look at just the first trumpet
[48:41] Church verse eight uh chapter 8 verse
[48:44] 6 verse 7 let's go to 87 to save time
[48:47] the first Angel sounded and there foued
[48:49] hail and fire mingled with blood when
[48:53] have we ever seen that hail fire and
[48:56] blood falling from the
[48:59] sky and they were cast upon the Earth
[49:04] who seen blood rained down from heaven
[49:06] we're not in the tribulation yet church
[49:09] it's going to be the most awful time R
[49:11] said do everything you can do to miss
[49:13] the tribulation period in other words
[49:14] trust in God live true to God love God
[49:17] repent of your sins serve God and the
[49:20] third part of trees was burned up a
[49:21] third of all the trees on the Earth are
[49:24] burned
[49:25] up and and all green grass all the green
[49:28] grass was burned up so you get
[49:31] two-thirds of the trees left all the
[49:33] grass is gone that's never happened

[49:37] people do you know some people believe
[49:38] this has already happened what world are
[49:40] they living in brother Rod what what
[49:42] fantasy are they living
[49:45] in verse eight and then the second Angel
[49:48] sounded and as it were a great Mountain
[49:49] burning with fire was cast into the sea
[49:52] a fiery Mountain was cast into the sea
[49:56] and the third part of the sea became
[49:58] blood a you would think we'd see that on
[50:02] on the social media if the third part of
[50:03] the sea was blood wouldn't we see that
[50:05] wouldn't somebody catch that on their
[50:06] phone of course this hasn't happened yet
[50:10] what are we going through the we're
[50:12] going through the birth pains Jesus said
[50:15] Wars rumors of wars pestilences
[50:17] earthquakes in diverse places all these
[50:19] are the beginning of Sorrows boy we're
[50:21] really getting some birth pains right
[50:22] now aren't we the two Wars and the
[50:24] hurricanes and then that my friend told
[50:26] me in Idaho there's a bunch of wildfires
[50:29] people are losing their houses there and
[50:32] yeah why W thank you I got the wrong
[50:34] State there I can't remember everything
[50:36] but just you know she's like and she's
[50:37] just in distress and then they got the
[50:39] election coming
[50:40] up uh and she says is this all part of
[50:42] the election I said it might
[50:44] be we don't know but one thing we know
[50:47] there's a greater election amen that's
[50:49] the election where you were elected to
[50:51] Salvation before the foundation of the
[50:53] world Amen that's the election we're
[50:55] trusting in Hallelujah
[50:59] brother BR said I only voted once that
[51:00] was for Jesus
[51:01] Christ he said and I only get one vote I
[51:04] vote for Christ Hallelujah Glory see
[51:07] Church you know we got to just pray for
[51:09] these people we got to understand the
[51:11] time and season that we're
[51:15] in Hallelujah let me close with this
[51:17] Psalm
[51:19] 461 oh it's perfect time okay
[51:22] yeah just got about an hour
[51:27] I never realized I was just going to use
[51:29] verse 13 but let's read the whole
[51:34] chapter to the chief musician for the
[51:37] sons of Kora a song upon
[51:43] alamoth Hallelujah and this was our
[51:46] memory verse in Bible club last month
[51:49] God is our refuge and strength God is
[51:51] your Fortress now I heard Martin Luther
[51:53] wrote A Mighty Fortress Is Our God based
[51:55] upon this verse that's been a classic
[51:57] hymn down through the years we need to
[51:58] sing it do we have do you know
[52:02] Malachi we'll have to practice that one
[52:05] Mighty Fortress Is Our
[52:08] God I can't remember the rest of the
[52:10] words there but I've heard it before
[52:11] it's a beautiful song who is your who's
[52:14] your Refuge who's your Tower God is
[52:18] who's your strength God a very present
[52:21] help in time of
[52:23] trouble that means vem
[52:26] holy speedily he's a speedy help in the
[52:29] time of trouble hallelujah
[52:32] amen
[52:34] therefore will not we fear though the
[52:36] Earth be removed and though the
[52:38] mountains be carried into the midst of
[52:39] the sea didn't we just talk about that
[52:40] my goodness we just read where the
[52:42] second Trump trumpet sounded even in
[52:44] that God says Don't Fear because God is
[52:47] in
[52:48] control now God forbid let me say this
[52:51] God forbid if any of us would have to
[52:52] live through the tribulation which means
[52:54] we're not born again we wouldn't have to
[52:56] fear because God would still take care
[52:58] of us somehow I know God cuts off the
[53:00] Gentiles right but he that's holy is
[53:02] Holy still he that's righteous is
[53:04] righteous still and God will not allow
[53:06] the righteous to suffer with the
[53:08] wicked so I believe we'd be gone by that
[53:11] time or we would not be affected or like
[53:12] the Bible does say remember this the
[53:14] Bible does say some of those in the
[53:16] tribulation will actually live through
[53:18] Armageddon and then they'll walk out in
[53:20] the ashes of the wicked as well in other
[53:22] words they'll be hiding in such a spot
[53:24] where all the the terrible trumpet and
[53:26] woes and vows won't harm them and
[53:29] they'll be able to walk out into the
[53:31] Millennium the Bible says that Zechariah
[53:33] those that are left of the remenant who
[53:36] make it through the battle of Armageddon
[53:38] they will be saved they'll go into the
[53:40] Millennium Hallelujah that's right God
[53:43] is rich in Mercy
[53:44] Church Glory verse three though the
[53:47] waters thereof Roar and be troubled look
[53:50] at the waters look at the Hurricanes
[53:51] though the mountains shake with the
[53:52] swelling thereof saah what saah mean it
[53:55] means pause
[53:57] it means suspension of music stop the
[53:59] music and pause right you've heard it
[54:03] said it probably means
[54:05] meditate so Church would you meditate on
[54:07] that God is your strength would you just
[54:09] pause for a
[54:10] moment though the waters Roar the
[54:13] mountains Shake pause remember God's
[54:15] your
[54:18] strength that's what this world doesn't
[54:20] want us to do wants to get notification
[54:22] on the next thing on the next thing but
