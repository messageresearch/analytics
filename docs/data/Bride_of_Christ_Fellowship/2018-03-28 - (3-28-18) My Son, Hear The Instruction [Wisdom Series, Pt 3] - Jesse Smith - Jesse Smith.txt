tonight by the grace of Lord I like to do part three on the wisdom series and tonight I want to look at a little thought to the youth kind of so it's going to be called my son here the instruction so let's look at proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 like to go this way tonight by the grace of the Lord as I'm studying I'm just kind of seeing more and more highlights here and things we need to emphasize how would it be the Holy Spirit would still emphasize the Old Testament how many believe that amen it's a lot of wisdom the Old Testament so I definitely want to see God and find his leadership for these things proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 now had to be seated by the grace of the Lord proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 so I like to speak on my son here the instructions let's read this I just reverse eight together if we can let's read on three one two three my son here the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother Amen what a beautiful thought let's just bow our heads here for a word of Prayer if ever need on your heart just make it known unto God who sees all things and knows all things heavenly father adore we come to another junction in the middle of the week here Lord God and we come here to be spiritually fed mower this is your plan this is your design Lord that we'd gather like sheep Lord God and we gather to the great Shepherd and you would feed us Lord service after service Lord week after week month after month year after year Lord we're grateful people Lord God because you're giving us food said spiritual in due season Lord God give us a word in due season tonight lord I just pray Lord that the Word of God would speak to every heart Lord every mind Lord God speak to our young lord here that are physically here and those that are live streaming Lord and all of us Lord God help us to learn from this message here tonight Lord as you so inspired it through Solomon Lord 3,000 years ago Lord and or we'll be careful to give you all the praise honor and glory in Jesus Christ name and the Saints that amen god bless you as you're being seated there praise God okay so Malachi can switch over Lydia can switch over I want to go through these quotes here tonight by the grace of Lord how many had ever had a real sit-down heart-to-heart with your mother father anyone ever had that before I maybe had a couple not too many and when I talk about it what I mean is you know when when I meet a heart-to-heart where you're your father or your mother just sits down with you only and gives you some real words of wisdom you know I don't know I didn't have too many you know my mom you know growing up when my dad divorced her she just kind of shot at us and tell us what to do you know she was so overwhelmed and with just life in general she would just kind of say Jessie do this or she called me like Simon then she called me cam then she called me Sam that she called me Paul then she called me Betsy then she finally called me Jessie my mom you know she's so overwhelmed she'd called me all the names and finally get to my name but of course she was a wonderful mother but this message tonight is kind of like that I'm kind of looking at this thought as I've read through I think I'm in chapter 24 now I've read chapters 1 to 24 and 31 and and I think one of the main thoughts from the first seven chapters is this idea of Solomon sitting down and talking to his son I don't know if it's as imagine it's his oldest son and then there's of course a couple of times you'll see tonight there's four times in the book of Proverbs where he says children so he's directing the children and so I wanted to just have this I want to start with that thought like tonight we just want to look at and see what would Solomon if you could sit down and listen to the wisest man on earth talk to his oldest son what would he say quite a quite a thought the wisest man outside of Christ if you could just sit there as a fly on the wall what would the wisest man on earth say to his son well we're gonna see it tonight by the grace of the Lord because he says over and over again my son my son my son and I think you'll be blessed by some of these thoughts and so as I as we read them let's think about you know let's think about conversations you can have with your children going forward for those of us who younger parents even older parents you know if you have a chance to sit down with your older children again the Lord would give you an opportunity I just want you to see what the Holy Spirit gave Solomon to say to his sons and then his children there's like I said there's four times or sama just dresses you children he's just speaking broadly to the children and so I'm happy tonight you know I can I can have my children I can tell them children I'm telling you what Solomon told his sons I feel very privileged to be able to do that I can say Malik I could say Lydia acacia all my children this is what God would have Solomon tell his sons and this is what I want to tell you as well now we do it on a daily basis right when we instruct him do this Malachi do this Lydia do this acacia you know do this we go through and tell him these things but I want you to see what the Holy Spirit would have Solomon to tell his son so let's look at this here tonight by the grace of the Lord and you can't you can't read this book without coming across this again and again he says my son my son my son my son ye children you children you can't read the book without seeing this emphasis and of course the Holy Spirit did that on purpose so that we would see what do we need to teach our children what do we need to tell them and I think you'll be blessed tonight by the grace of the Lord now remember in the message and purpose this book the youth are repeatedly admonished to pursue wisdom rather than foolishness and the you should seek to become teachable rather than mockers and I hope that's hope that's how you feel when you look at my children I hope every parent you know feels that way about their children that my children can be teachable how many want their children to be teachable I know what my children to be spoiled rotten know-it-alls I want them to look at the the Saints that are older than them and I want to look up I want them to respect you so I hope that's how my children look if not I got to go home and I got to correct myself first but I believe that you can you can talk to my children and they'll listen to you and they won't disrespect you Adam have they ever distant disrespected you my children I hope not because he's deacon he's he's got to have respect he's got to have that respect well Ram said the children have to respect the deacon if not well Ram said tell me about it and I'll talk to the children about it my children about it the youth have to have a sense of respect for the elderly this is one of the great important aspects of being wise and growing up to be a wise person I notice there's 23 times Salman says my son now of course this applies to all the daughters too but it gives us a nice insight and and here's Solomon he's like the President of Israel he's like the king of Israel we know there's no higher man than Solomon and this is what he would say to his son or sons at the very height of his wisdom remember Ecclesiastes was what he wrote at the end of his life when he's back slid in and he's kind of is he the joy of life has left him you know he's he's not very wise anymore he's dishonored God but the proverbs was written in the very height of his wisdom and so this is what he would write to his son and then this this this phrase here he children has spoken four times so you kind of get an idea what he'd say to to all the children okay so have your Bibles ready let's just let's just be ready to read a lot here about the grace of the Lord I think we'll just go right from chapter one on and at the end of this I kind of want to bring it down to the adults and I want to look at how the adults can be mentors to young believers the but we'll get to that how the Bible says the older women ought to be willing to teach the younger women at the same time you know the younger women got to be willing to be taught right and the younger men got to be willing to be taught to by the older men as long as they're qualified to teach you know they must have a godly testimony you will see and the Bible lays out what your requirements are to be to be a godly teacher whether a woman teaching other women or man teaching other men so that's why I kind of want to go with this direction I want to look at this okay so let's go to chapter one now if you look up here there's 23 times he says my sons my number of these and we'll get through maybe half of them tonight by the grace of Lord just depending on how fast we read let's go to chapter 1 verses 8 and 9 let's go to proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 9 8 was our text so Malachi can you start can you read verses 8 9 please sir amen now the word here means to obey it's not just listen it's not just you know look at me and and your eyes are on me and you know you're actually hearing with your eardrum it actually means to obey so Solomon say my son obey me obey your father and obey your mother this is his first time he addresses of course the the reader how many glad you obeyed your parents when you were younger I was very grateful how many wished you would obeyed your parents better no you'd have to raise your hand but I can say truly my children have truly obeyed my wife and I they've been such faithful children I'm very grateful for how they've obeyed me now look at verse 9 for if children if you obey your father's instruction and mother's instruction the Bible said the grace of God is like an ornament or chain around your neck and now the word grace means favor so children you want favor when you get older doing people to favor you and like you more than maybe sinners or they can help you more when you're older you have to start at the beginning by honoring your mother and father and if you do that you'll find favor later on in life you know I think of how I just share a few things from my heart here you know I take we take our children to horse lessons well the leaders of the horse lessons have told me numerous times like the man's almost crying he said you got the most beautiful family brother Jesse he's almost crying and it's because the girls fear the Lord and the boys numb and then a Taekwon no I've had numerous people tell me give Malachi great compliments and things like that and why is that it's because they're being taught the Word of God the Word of God is a seed and it's planted in their hearts and if you plant it in their hearts it will bring forth a new season and so Malachi is favorite Taekwondo when they need somebody to do a help that adult can do like the other day I we were just exercising I didn't know how to hold the bag I kept messing up the bag well the first one they chose to take my place was my own son because he has favor and he does a good job you know I've never held the bag before so I don't know how to hold it that's kind of funny cuz he started before me and he just he pays better attention I guess than me but the first person they chooses not other adults it was Malachi because he's got favor he's earned favor with them it's because he listens he works hard he doesn't talk back he sweats every time you know he takes it seriously and just like that at the horse lessons that the girls have the favor of the head man and the head woman like I just they put it on Facebook the other day they can't wait to get back and see the girls again and I just thought I'd just share I'm not bragging on my children I'm just saying like that's what the Word of God should produce the Word of God has to have an effect if you're putting the word in the children's lives it has to have an effect and it'll work for anybody because the it's universal it's a seed and it's play if it's placed in the heart the right way it'll bring forth of its own kind so I want to say that you know our children should have favor as a good older if we're teaching them the Word of God and making them you know making them obey sometimes bamboo sticks if you need bamboo sticks I use bamboo sticks to smack my children on the back of their legs you know for I haven't had to do it for a while they've been pretty well behaved but that's how we trained our children you know just with bamboo sticks in order to produce grace in their lives that they'll have favor as they get older and so we've seen that by the grace of the Lord this was Solomon says them the wisest man outside of Christ says children listen to your mother listen to their father it'll give you favor around your neck now let's go to verses 10 through 14 Lydia can you read 10 through 14 in chapter 1 I'm sorry you're fine yeah take your time no problem proverbs 1 10 through 14 all right so what's what Solomon's first warning to his son I'm him or he's King his first warning his son do not take company with with a bunch of violent young men that's his first warning now you're gonna see the main thing he warns him about is violence searching for riches and women those are the main three if you read the first eight or nine chapters Solomon's first warning of course his son would have riches all around him he'd be living in the nicest rooms in all of Israel he'd probably have gold you know a gold bedpost you know he does the softest feathers and all of Israel would be under his pillow you know he'd have and so his his main direction to his son don't hang around violent young men don't try to get rich quick just do what's right listen to your mother listen to your father in other words hang around the right people right birds of a feather flock together right so that's first warning to his son be careful who you hang around and I'm very careful who my children hang around like I said we don't do sleepovers because I'm very careful who they hang around with and if I see them hanging around with someone who's not good character we're done hanging around with that mouth for a while we'll be done with that well will break off Taekwondo if Malachi can't behave we'll break it off if they can't behave at the horse lessons and there are somebody's infiltrating my daughter's we're gonna break it off we're gonna make sure they're around godly people that's why I love bringing them to church because they're around you all godly people that love the Lord I love how they run over to sister Connie when Connie gets here and they're gonna give her hugs and hug all of you you know and they talk so highly of Adam in BO and Naomi they talk so highly of all of you at home you know they do it's because we want them around the godliest people we know and give them warnings we don't hang around any fools we don't hang around any child that's gonna corrupt your behavior you will not hang around them very long we'll take you out of their out of their presence that's the first warning company be around the right people have the right company all right let's go to the third time he says my sons go to verse 15 now hi can you read 15 through 19 please sir all right so again he just takes some more time more admonition to stay away from the greedy violent young men right because don't young men like to feel strong and I'm crying knows that we like to feel strong we like to feel invincible I like to feel that we can conquer you know we like to feel like we're important or powerful or strong we want to be leaders you know with Solomon's warning his son don't go with the men that are doing it for greed don't hang around them keep the right company don't try to get rich fast and don't try to fight and prove how strong you are you know it takes more of a man not to fight somebody right takes more of a man or woman a godly woman to step back and not fight because jesus said if somebody slaps you on the cheek he said turn the other cheek right anybody can fight back but it's the person who can control themselves and be a Christian testimony that's the person who's really got christ-like character and so that's what Solomon says here now let's go to chapter 2 verse 1 like I said I'm just gonna hit this to the fourth time Solomon says my son and then I just hit you know the highlights I just want to make make sure I emphasize here in the text how do you feel like you feel like it's pretty good advice so far from a king a rich king a wise king pretty good vice listen to your mother and father and then don't hang around young men that will corrupt your character violent young men men that are trying to get greedy quickly hang around the right company this is the wisdom of God chapter 2 verse 1 I'll read this 1 through 9 my son if thou won't receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding now like verses 3 to 6 now on the Bible study I did last Wednesday night I really emphasized verses 3 to 6 if you want to grow in the fear of the Lord this is how you grow in the fear of the Lord brother brand I've always said you know pray and read your Bible it's so true and this is this is the kind of prayers we need in verse 3 yeah if I cry after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures then thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the Lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding all right so when was the last time you search the internet for something you really needed what was the last time you searched YouTube to try to fix your bathroom sink I did a few weeks ago I watched video after video how do I fix this it's not draining how do I fix with the stopper and so I crawled under there I watch a few videos and I took about an hour to fix the sink and I had to really had to really search I need to know how do I do this I don't want to mess up the plumbing you have to call the plumber it's gonna be a hundred dollars just for a service call now I didn't cry out for knowledge but I had to kind of set everything aside I wanted to do and I had to go spend some time watching YouTube on how to fix the bathroom sink well that's what God said here if you want knowledge you've got it invest time in it if you want to fear god if you were to love God more you've got to cry out for that amen none of us can you can't go about it any other way you've got to get alone with God and say God give me wisdom God give me understanding God help me to love the word more amen there's no other way to get it than to get alone with God and cry out for wisdom this is what Solomon is telling his son do you want to be wise you got to cry out for it that's verses 1 to 6 remember verse 5 again shows how to understand the fear of the Lord or grow in the fear of the Lord a member the fear of the Lord is the whole driving force behind getting wisdom we'll never get to whistle remember the fear the Lord is like our fuel you're not going to get your destination wisdom you're not going to get to wisdom without having the fuel of the fear of the Lord fear the Lord is the most important thing it's the beginning of wisdom so we must fear God we must respect God we must keep his word we must honor God's word that will drive us to a wise life amen we'll be wise virgins hallelujah amen that's right and that's what the Bible said he was last Wednesday night was on the fear of the Lord now look at verse a set I'm sorry you verse seven yeah he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous so God has that wisdom laid up if we'll just go get it he's a buckler to them that walk uprightly he's a shield in other words God will protect you if you're walking in the truth he keepeth the pass of judgment and preserveth the way of his Saints verse nine then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity and every good path Amen that's that's my burden church oh that's your burden I want to walk a perfect life before Christ I want every path I make as a pastor every path I choose as a pastor every path I choose as a father as a schoolteacher I want every path I choose to walk on to be the right path I don't want to walk in a wrong path I want to know I don't want to get off the beaten path I want to stay true to God's Word this is what wisdom does it will help you choose every right decision now I must hit the highlights of verse twelve to deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speaketh froward things so again he's telling his son wisdom will deliver you from the evil man so because remember wisdom won't let you walk with the evil man and if it won't let you walk away or hang out with the evil man it's gonna deliver you from the evil man praise the Lord and now Solomon gets into the second thing that I'm sorry the third thing that his son really has to avoid the strange woman remember violence quick money hanging out with the evil men and then now the strange woman so go to verse 16 now can you read verse 16 please sir so wisdom will deliver you from evil men it'll deliver you from evil woman how many seen it work before Amen wisdom will do that it will protect you as a shield it will make sure you walk in the right paths now here's what the Bible said the evil woman does verse 17 she forsaketh the guide of her youth so she either left her leadership of her father or she left her husband or maybe first husband second husband who knows she left the guide of her youth and forgets the Covenant of her God so that's a strange woman a woman who doesn't honor the Covenant of God's Word look at verse 18 for a house and cliath unto death and her pass unto the dead none that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the pass of life so in other words most men who get involved in adultery go to hell most men right because we know the few few there are that be saved jesus said and here the Bible says when a woman gets him ensnared he goes to the way of Hell now that's chapter 2 that's his fourth warning to his son he starts talking about the evil men and stay away from evil women alright chapter three let's go to verse 1 chapter 3 verse 1 like I said we'll try to get through as many of these as we can I think there's 23 where he says my son yeah alright chapter 3 verses 1 to 10 now let's look at the benefits here you're gonna see all these probabilities remember of Proverbs has promises and also probabilities probabilities of longer days long life peace health and Phil Barnes these are all things Solomon as a king wants his sons to remember about wisdom all right my son forgetting out my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments Oh Samson remember Samson gave God his strength but not his heart in other words Samson kept the Word of God because he should have you know his parents told him to when it came down to who do you love more Delilah or the Lord he loved the the filthy woman more than love God's Word see we want to love God's Word more than anything else we want to obey that doctrine from the heart Paul said if you can't obey it from the heart yet just keep obeying it and say God helped me to love to obey this helped me to love your word more than anything else but see that's what Solomon I'm sorry Samson didn't have of course Solomon lost it at end of his life too he loved his wives more than he loved the Lord at the end of his life my what a sad story we don't want that testimony verse 2 for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee sounds like the statue of pervert man if you keep the wisdom of God God will add all these things to you add your faith and virtue then now it kind of sounds like that doesn't it's kind of an Old Testament statute of a perfect man if you keep your father's commands and your mother's law I'm gonna give you long life first length of day second piece those three look at verse 3 let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart beautiful mercy and truth so thou shalt find favor that's Grace and good understanding in the sight of God and man how many remember when Jesus the Bible said when he was raising up the Bible said Jesus grew in favor with man and with God praise the Lord I remember that from the Luke chapter 1 he grew in favor with man and God Solomon says the same thing if you give heed to wisdom you'll you'll have favor with men and you have favor with God as well amen what a promise ah we need we need to take advantage of that promise amen we want people to favor us oh if I could choose any of the teachers I choose mr. Smith right we we want a favor I could choose anybody on the factory I choose brother Adam right I could choose anybody here to church I to sister so-and-so you want favor with God and with man verse five oh this is the most when the most memorized verses in all Holy Writ let's read it let's read it together one two three trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths amen that's so worth memorizing amen trust in God with all your heart that's why people break commands of God like that's why people you know leave a marriage they don't trust God well God can't help my spouse or God can't help my wife err and so they don't trust in God with all their heart or let's say they stop paying their tithes and offerings well I don't I just don't think God can provide you know I can't see anything getting better at work you know they don't trust in God with all their heart if God gave a promise God's gonna move all heaven to back up that promise amen not to wait and be tested a little longer than what you want to wait but you just hang around God's Word heaven earth shall pass away but God's Word will never pass away it's exactly right see they don't trust God we need to trust God with all of our heart now look at verse 7 that's where we got to be careful for especially the message be not wise in thine own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil that's that's why I said earlier we got to be careful with that with well I think I can get away with this I'll just break the word a little bit here maybe maybe the word doesn't apply in every situation I'll just break it here a little bit I'll compromise a little bit that's us being wise in our own eyes we must not be wise in our eyes but in the eyes of God because look what happens if you do that verse 8 more promises verse 8 it shall be health to thy navel that's your stomach mero to thy bones now look he gets into tithing here so he's telling you son son you better pay your tithe verse 9 honor the Lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all that increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine which farmer wouldn't want that barns that were full which Christian doesn't want a bank account that you know you've got enough in the bank account to pay all the bills that month or that season of your life what Christian doesn't want that blessing well if you want that blessing Solomon says you've got to trust in the Lord with all your heart you've got to give God the first increase right the firstfruits and he says if you do that your barns will be full and you'll have whatever you need what a promise now that's verses 1 to 10 now in verses 11 to 20 he gives a next admonition I'm gonna do it on time okay do it okay all right Malachi can you read 11 11 to 15 let's see 11 to 15 hey man we'll stop right there the next thing the fifth I'm sorry the sixth thing he says to his son my son don't get tired of God correcting you right don't get tired of God's Word constantly correcting you showing you where you're wrong don't get tired of that be happy when God corrects you and then he gets into next the promise of happiness you will be happy the Bible says happy is the man that finds wisdom amen what a promise I love verse 15 she is more precious than rubies and all the things that thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her what a statement my goodness oh my think of LeBrons LeBron James is home over there in Bath Township it's been compared to a hotel his house is so big it's like a hotel and then he's got houses in Florida and then houses in California all these things you could want are nothing to be compared to the wisdom of God you can't even compare them well he just signed a contract for 33 million dollars for one year that's nothing compared to the wisdom that God is trying to give us is that right that's kinda it's got a silly but that's true the wisdom that we're supposed to live daily with is more valuable than any riches we can put on any scale 100 million two hundred million three hundred million 1 billion 10 billion any valuable merchandise and the amount of money the Bible says is nothing compared to being wise amen so let's just remember let's try to shake off our the dust off our minds and just remember how valuable it is to be a Christian in this hour so valuable and I was thinking of you know some examples of wisdom you know on the way to church I didn't have a chance to ride all them down but I was thinking about how we must choose to do wise things the Bible said the wise Christian redeems the time so we need to make wise decisions about how we handle our time in other words we need to give more of our time to helping others we need to get more of our time to giving to others more of our time to getting alone with God and praying and seeking the Lord giving to the Lord anything and I'm gonna think of some examples in the scripture I think of Cornelius you know how he devoted time after time you know he was a soldiers right so he would leave he would leave a Rome right his post of duty Rome and he would go home and he would spend his time praying and fasting and giving alms to the poor right he left the army right he let me leave the reserves let's just call it the reserves okay corniest would leave the reserves he'd come home and he'd spend time praying he'd spend time going to give alms to the poor maybe on the way to work he'd slip out a few $5 bill give it to the poor guy that you know he know he's not a crack addict you know he he wouldn't waste his money he'd be wise even with his money so he was so wise he spent his time praying in secret fasting giving to the poor and then God sends an angel at the very moment he is praying and fasting and said I'm gonna send you Peter get ready to receive a man who preach the gospel amen in the very moment of praying and fasting God sends an answer so think about how wise it is that that's so applicable for you and I and the example I'll get for the women I've said it again and again I'll say it again sister Dorcas after she died they came around and showed Peter all the clothes that she knit together for the children her ministry after she would do her work her ministry was to go knit together make clothes and give him out to the poor children and God's thought so much that he raised Dorcas from the dead what a great ministry we should be doing things that are helping other people yeah as we get that we'll get to the proverbs 31 woman a week from Sunday I'll preach on that I'll preach a Easter message Sunday but then the following Sunday remember she did all these things she had her children clothed she had a business in the field she was planting food in the field she was providing she was making money she's bringing in food from the ships you know this was a real godly businesswoman you know she was very wise with her time and so we've got to make sure we're wise with our time and not wasting our time I don't get me wrong church I get tired like you there's times I just need to sit on the couch and relax that's okay if not I'm gonna get sick again if I don't do that but there's times we need to look at our time and the wisest people will redeem the time they'll make the most of their time living for other people but of course rest yourself to don't wear yourself out so you're no good to anybody so wisdom has no comparison you can't put a price tag on it 20 million 30 million 40 million you can't put a price tag on the the knowledge that God wants or has already given you or is going to continue give you to give you the help you live the right kind of life you can't put a price tag on it in other words it's so valuable to come to church when we're preaching on wisdom amen it is more valuable than if you are working tonight at JC Penney or something like that well I need an extra job no you just need more wisdom praise the Lord now if you're gonna get an extra job and not miss church praise the Lord that's great or like brother I'd have said a woman that wants to help her husband pay off the debts he said that's fine that's wonderful that's wisdom usually a woman's place is in the kitchen but we know there's times where the RAM said it's okay if she needs it if she can do it and not neglect her children and she can work a little job and help out the family praise the Lord but wisdom will never lead us to break God's word that's exactly right and there's no value we can place on how to make wise choices in your life I love I'll say like this I love when people come to church and I'm the same way and you come to church and say God I need wisdom for my life I've got an unspoken request I need to know what to make on the next decision don't you love coming to church like that God loves when you come to church like that I love when people say brother Jesse pray for me for wisdom I love that they're actually asking for the most valuable thing they could ask for right if they came up and said I need a million dollars that's I would actually say well let me pray for you to get wisdom first because if you have that attitude of what a greedy attitude of what money if you get it you're gonna waste it anyway the most valuable thing you could ask for is God's wisdom so don't don't no let's not skip past verse 15 so so quickly.i I just felt led to kind of stay a little longer on that you cannot desire anything more important than what decision to make next in your life should I travel there should I live there should I move there should I leave the job should I do this should I leave move to the church or do a different Church or what whatever a decision you're gonna make it is the most valuable thing to find the wisdom of God for that situation I cannot you cannot and I cannot place a high price on it it's invaluable it's exactly right now let's finish verse 16 length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honor so look wisdom is sitting there it's got long days and it's got riches and honor on the other hand wisdom saying come get wisdom for me I'll give you wisdom and it's got riches and honor and it's got a length of days now who does it what who wants them who wants a shorter life here does anybody want a shorter life anybody want to go to the grave any time soon I don't think so anybody want to struggle financially here nobody ends up the way to avoid those in most cases like I said most cases there's job cases and there's other cases right there's the the beggar Lazarus the beggar there's that case there are certain cases where God allows people to be tested but in most cases you want to live longer and you wouldn't have enough money to live a good life that's you know that's my main reason for what for wanting more money if I would want war more money is to be able to give more is to be able to help more people the Bible said when you help people poor people it's like helping it's like lending to God and the Bible said if you neglect the poor the Bible will read it later in Proverbs the Bible said you're gonna have curses come upon you if you neglect the poor but if you give to the poor great is your treasure in heaven amen hallelujah that's why I think we would like if you'd like to see more money that's why you want to see more money so your barns are full you can be giving more to other people giving more to God and you don't know you don't worry about those things you can just focus more of your time on God amen that's right look at verse 17 her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace so when you come to wisdom she's got long life she's got riches and honor all her ways are pleasantness and all her paths are peace our lives should be pleasant even lair to see it we should look at our lives and say I've got a pretty pleasant life God has God has so blessed my life my life is very pleasant it's not it's not it's not awful and you could also should look at your life and say I've got a very peaceful life that's what wisdom is supposed to produce peace look at verse 18 she wisdom is a tree of life amen Oh glory to them that lay a hold on her and happy as everyone that retains her the Lord by wisdom hath found the earth by understanding he established the heavens by his knowledge the depths are broken up in the clouds drop down the dew do you feel like that you feel like when you read your Bible and pray do you feel like you're picking apples off the Tree of Life pears oranges you name it cherries that's what God's holy spirit is it's a tree of life and we're supposed to go find the wisdom and pick it off and say I've got wisdom for today I've got a real important meeting I prayed I've got a real I got a conflict here at work I've got a conflict in the church er I need wisdom before you go to that meeting that's the time to go to the tree of life and pluck off some wisdom amen yeah that's right there happy is everyone that finds the tree of wisdom I don't know how to handle this brother Jesse I don't know how to handle this go to God go to the tree of wisdom and say God I need some wisdom and God said I'll give it to you and then once you see God's Word overcome or you see it overcome again you'll be rejoicing saying oh this is so valuable this is so much better than just natural riches it was the wisdom of God for the situation amen you know recently I didn't I don't tell anybody about this you know but recently I had somebody kind of approach me and try to correct me on numerous things and I just went to the meeting praying and fasting and I let the person talk they must have talked for the first 15 minutes and and just send all these things I was wrong on which I appreciate and you know what church is like brother BAM said I have more respect for that person now that at least they came to me to talk about it program said when you love somebody even disagree with them if you can love them at the end he said you'll think more of them than you did before if you keep the right spirit but I'll say like this in this meeting now that's just my opinion the other person probably disagrees but I - my observation I saw the wisdom of God just flow out for every question and I was accused of worse things this wrong that wrong never I think that's wrong I think that's wrong and I didn't get nervous you know why because I was praying I was in the spirit I'd ask God to guide me and I felt like God gave me wisdom to answer every one of the objections and I left there just as happy and we hugged and we were both crying at the end you know who's just a great good old meeting like I said I think more of this individual than I ever have in my life and though we differ on things I felt like God gave me the wisdom to say and I walked out there as happy I rather I would rather walk out of there feeling like the wisdom of God spoke than have a million dollars in my pocket and no I compromise God's Word amen I'd rather have that because it's more valuable the Bible tells me that you might say I'm foolish but I'll tell you you're foolish if you don't believe God's Word being wise and making the wise decisions is more valuable than just being rich more valuable all these things are promised to those who walk in wisdom length of days pleasantness peace it's a tree of life if you like if you don't feel like you're living it's time to get it's time to get this time to get God's wisdom and say because when you've got God's wisdom you know you've done what's right you know you have obeyed the Word of God now you can be happy now I can feel like I'm living I'm doing what God called me to do that's why people can't many times feel like they're happy because they feel like they're torn I'm breaking the Word of God or I've done something wrong we've got to confess our wrongs and then do the right wise decision walk in a wise path and then the Bible said we'll be happy we'll have life well have peace we should walk through this life as a walk of peace we should live the bottom ember the Bible said live peaceably with all men we should have peace even if people disagree with us or don't like us or speak evil of us we should have to be able to walk in such wisdom that we at least we have peace with them that's what the Bible says all right go to verse 21 this is the seventh time he says my son chapter 3 verse 21 Lydia are you able to read hon no okay sorry about that thanks for watching her Malachi read 21 to 26 please amen let's stop right there now the first thing I want to say is he tells his son set wise words before your eyes let me ask you and I gotta ask myself - what do we place him before our eyes are we constantly looking at wise things or foolish things he tells his son if the wisest man could tell us son he said he said look at wise things keep the wise words of God before your eyes we have to physically look at the wisdom of God and the Bible says discretion is purpose the Bible said keep sound wisdom and discretion or keep a sound purpose in your life now discretion in the modern means good judgment but in the Hebrew it means purpose have a sound of purpose for your life who knows what they were put on earth here to do does everyone know what they're put on earth to do I know what I was put on earth to do be a father a husband and preach the gospel that's how I was put on earth to do I've already wrestled that out with God I've already prayed and hung it up I've saw it God long enough to know that's what I'm supposed to do on this earth and the Bible said that we all should have a discretion we all should have a purpose that's why that book sewed sold so well it's called The Purpose Driven Life remember back in 2002 I think it was I think it sold 60 million copies you imagine it people want to know what's my purpose what am I on earth to do I'll give you a clue whatever you're called to do is going to be a walk of wisdom amen your calling is going to be something that involves the wisdom of God not foolishness of God who's just a man but the wisdom of God so the writer tells us wisdom is life to the soul and grace to the neck so it protects you it gives you life how many want to walk a walk for Christ and never stumble that's what the Bible promises there's that probability again if you walk and choose the right path the Bible said you won't stumble how many want to sleep good at night I want to sleep good at night I hate in the nights where I can't sleep good the Bible said have you walk in wise paths you sleep where your sleep will be sweet and you will live a life without fear amen this is what we does you know you've done the will of God you know you've done what's right so you can sleep good at night and you're not afraid of what's gonna happen next that's the wisdom of God can anybody think of any better benefits that God has left out for wisdom anybody ever looked at your benefits package for work it's pretty nice package you gotta get a nice package can any way think of any better package blessings that God has kept out from us if we walk in wisdom I can't think of anything you sleep good there's no fear you got longer life got prosperity got health you got eternal life you've got the Tree of Life amen it's more valuable than anything in a natural package a company could offer you will come work for me I promise you I'll give you a I'll cover a hundred percent of your insurance well God's got a better coverage than that it's called the wisdom of God amen hallelujah look at the benefits of just waiting on the Lord remember because before you get the wisdom you got to have fear of the Lord and fear the Lord hates evil look at the benefits of just waiting on God not breaking the word and God says I have this tremendous package for you to work in my kingdom I want you to work about my father's business I've got a special position for you sister for you brother for the children I've got a special position in the father's business and I've got all these benefits I don't want you to forget your benefits package hahaha oh yeah and there's nothing you can bear there's nothing Satan can offer that's better than this oh my god is so good to us what a blessing let's just maybe go one more chapter here by the grace of the Lord I don't go too long let's go to chapter 4 verses 1 to 9 are you enjoying this I hope you're enjoying it by God's grace what would the wisest man say to his sons remember he's rich he's got everything he's got all kinds of wives he owns the kingdom anything Solomon could ask for anything he could give his children he said what's more valuable than that is to hate evil is to walk away from evil and find the fear of the Lord and the wisdom of God this is beautiful this is a really good insight here look at verse 1 chapter 4 verse 1 here you children the instruction of a father and intend to no understanding so now he starts talking to the holeshot whole children that's the first time out of 4 times he he starts addressing all the children before I give you good doctrine forsake not I'm sorry forsake he not my law look at this is beautiful look at verse 3 for I was my father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother and that's beautiful now we get a look who taught Solomon how to be wise his daddy David where do you think David got his wisdom from his father where did Solomon get his wisdom from he said I was taught it by my father look at verse 4 he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my commands and live that's beautiful so now we know where saman got a lot of his wisdom now look Church if David had time to sit down and talk to his sons shouldn't we have time to David wrote songs David had to rule the kingdom right David had to fight wars but according to Solomon David had time to sit down and say come here Solomon remember my words don't forget my commands there's something special if you haven't sat down with your children and give them a nice heart-to-heart talk it's you say say God give me wisdom when to do that because that's what David did to Solomon and Solomon is now doing it for his children someone needs to sit down with those children and tell them keep my commands right yeah look my turn in the eye I can do that when I get home too but we do it all the time about telling them what to do and what to say how to treat people keep my commands that's what David looked in Solomon's I'd said you keep my laws listen to your father and this is the wisdom of the Holy Spirit look at verse five get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee how many love the wisdom of God love it oh I just love to come to church er I just love to read my Bible and hear God's wisdom that directs me on the right path amen I love that the Bible said if you love wisdom she'll take care of you Oh hallelujah verse seven wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding this is absolutely beautiful portions of Scripture exalt her so lift up wisdom make it the most important thing in your life the Bible said on her and she will promote you amen don't you like that if you lift her up she'll lift you up amen what a blessing hallelujah promise that's a promise she shall bring thee to honor when thou does embrace her when you can really love the wisdom of God it will make others honor you that's the promise of scripture verse 9 he repeats it again she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace people will just see grace God's favor all over your face if you choose the wisdom of god it's beautiful remember what remember what did what did stephen have whenever he looked at him they're gonna get ready to kill what he have he had the face of an angel the wisdom of god hallelujah a crowd of glory shall she deliver thee reminds me reminds us the st. Paul doesn't it he said I've got a crown of glory just waiting for me because I fought a good fight I've won the race so I hope you can see this there's nothing more important in life than growing in the wisdom of God your daily decisions like I said I gave those examples well maybe I'll just leave my marriage maybe I'll just stop paying ties maybe I'll just stop going to church maybe I'll just stop and people make all these rash dishes decisions without really looking to the Word of God for the answer right well I think I'll go into this new business or I think I'll go into this new decision here I think I'll go in this path here I think I'll just form this disagreement here or this covenant or I'll make a league with this person or that person but the most important thing to do is have the wisdom of God that's exactly right it's the most important thing what should I do with the next decision in my life nothing can be more important than that and that's why I think God you know so answered my prayer when I was going to quit pastoring a few years ago into 2014 I said God if you don't save a soul and help me to bring someone in the message I'm an equip pastor and I'm gonna be an evangelist and so God said brother hey men to us I thought that was really striking because I was gonna leave what was the purpose for my life right and I put it I put it in God's hands this is so important god I don't know what to do should I keep pastoring or should I just be an evangelist I know I'm called to preach I know that I know that's been vindicated to me and so God swiftly answered because God knew I wanted to walk in the right path I don't want to take a step out and then oh he stopped passed or numbers oh brother Jesse stop pastoring her oh but now he's gonna go back into it he stepped out of the will of God I don't want anybody to say I stepped out of the will of God I want to stay in the will of God now we all make mistakes but RAM said by the will of God we know we all make mistakes from time to time but our desire should be to always walk in the path of wisdom that's right let's let's do this one more here and then I want to bring it closer this thought of mentoring at the end here alright proverbs chapter 4 verse 10 through 19 I love this that's let's read this here here all my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many I have taught thee in the way of wisdom I have led thee and right paths when thou goest I step shall not be straightened and when thou run us now shalt not stumble take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy life now let me just stop right there most people don't want to be told what to do most people don't want to be instructed and told what to do but a Christian can recognize when it's God's wisdom telling them what to do it's not brother Jesse trying to rule your life I'm not trying to do that what I'm trying to do is point everybody to the Word of God I'm trying to let my life be pointed to the Word of God and then make the decision that keeps the Word of God but see most people say oh you can't tell me nothing I mean not most people but some people you know you who are you to tell me what to do it really isn't me trying to tell you what to do or any preacher or brother Brooks or anybody it's us trying to point us to the Holy Spirit and to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit and turn away and hate evil and love righteousness it always boils down to that but most people don't want to be instructed verse 14 enter not to the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men avoid it passed not by it turn from it and pass away for they sleep not except they have done mischief so there so they so love evil they can't even go to sleep until they've done some evil or and looked at some evil thoughts of evil and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall verse 17 for they eat the bread of wickedness and the drink and drink the wine of violence I like this here it is right here but the path of the just is as the shining light that shine ahthe more and more unto the perfect day amen hallelujah praise the Lord would you like that if we are walking in the wisdom of God our lives should be more bright in Christ all the time as we go along serving God it shouldn't be more dark well I wonder from it should get more light it should just take more questions out the more I serve God the more clearer it becomes oh this is so clear the day is shining brighter and brighter unto the bright day the Bible said my life should get more clear should be more clear all the time this is what God wants me to do if it's getting more dark we need to get in the dark closet and pray more right are the Bible says in the Old Testament that the light shines brighter and brighter unto a perfect day it's like the story brother Graham told about your life but the man said your life is like a day right he said you said like the the morning sunrise is like your little baby you go to school and then he said about noon days and you're getting out of school and now you got to get married that's your noon day so some of us have already past noon but he said that evening time you're a grandfather grandmother the sun's going down on your life right that's kind of like the day your day is symbolized your life is symbolizes the day rather but spiritually the day should get brighter and brighter the Bible said we go from faith to faith the Bible say we go from glory to glory amen we should see our lives getting more clear with the will of God for our lives that's what the Bible says if we walk and wisdom our life gets brighter and brighter all the time we know what God's called us here for I know what I'm supposed to do and I'm happy to do what God's called me to do hey glory I'm not walking around the darkness and this where I'm supposed to go where where am I supposed to go what's the next step of my life it's more clear all the time because I'm walking in the wisdom of God not just you know just what guess and I wonder if I should do this we don't walk around with blindfolds trying to which way do we go next we have a guy Jesus Christ as our guide amen he's our guy like mother brand when he got lost he looked up for that electric line that's that was his guide home right and so is our guide home is holding God's unchanging hand amen the nail-scarred hand which is the Word of God our wise life should shine brighter and brighter unto a perfect day huh me know the Holy Spirit is the dissolver of all doubts how we know that remember as you grow growing God you should sleep better less fear longer life increase the money most the time you should see this with the blessing of God on your life but you've got to choose fear of the Lord first I'll always Reverend Scott I'll always hey evil I always choose the right path and God will direct your paths to wisdom to the tree of life let me close to this I got numerous more slides but I didn't get two of them let me close with this I got quite a few out skip pass okay since we're here in Proverbs go to proverbs 27:17 let's go to that one proverbs 27:17 Malachi can you read that proverbs 27:17 the Bible said iron sharpens iron and your godly countenance or your Gauley spirit will sharpen other people's spirit so how many know it's important to have the right spirit the right attitude if we have the right attitude and we're walking the wisdom of God when we interact with others we're only gonna help them serve God oh brother Adam how you doing her brother sister so it's how you do how's things at work how's things at school the way you talk about your life should sharpen their lives right because you start talking about oh would you do it worker how'd you do this or what'd you do with your finances when you talk about life with other people it should naturally sharpen them you should really enjoy fellowship when you get to talk to people because your spirit should sharpen their spirit and that's one way wisdom wisdom is passed on the Christian Church we sharpen each other I can't talk to brother Adam except I want to be a better man when I talk to him at the end cuz I hear what he's doing her I hear what he's studying the Word of God his spirit should sharpen my spirit my spirit should sharpen his spirit because we should talk about the Lord right we should talk about wise things not foolishness or did you see that video on YouTube out I was hilarious that's all you do the whole time you're gonna be a fool pretty soon right it's okay to laugh every now and then but if that's all you talk about you're gonna become a you're gonna become a fool they're gonna be a laughing jester a court jester you're gonna become a laughing fool you your spirit what you talk about should make other people more wise now this other idea of mentoring if you need a mentor the church let let the person know you can't mentor everybody so Jesus chose 12 people he could mentor because you can't mentor the whole world you don't have enough time to do that even God himself in flesh that I can I can help about 12 guys at a time I'll live with these 12 guys I'll travel with them for three and a half years that's about all I can handle our church is really small so you have to worry about mentoring that many people but I want you to if you feel like you need wisdom pray about approaching somebody older in the church or somebody that maybe is older than the Lord maybe they've served God longer than you like if your sister and you need help from an older sister look at their life make sure they are a qualified sister make sure they're a godly sister and pray about approaching them because their countenance can sharpen you how many can say amen to that and if you're a brother you need help or need some type of wisdom or need some type of counsel pray about it find a brother who you feel like is really god-fearing and real reverent walks in the fear of the Lord and approach them and ask say can we sit down and have a little fellowship I've got some questions I've got to ask you there's nothing wrong with that now go to Titus chapter 2 we'll kind of finish her there we are here to help each other on the way on our journey for wisdom Titus chapter 2 verse 1 but speak the things which become sound doctrine that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith and charity in patience so when I need advice I don't go to younger men usually I go to men that I've watched serve god for years and years and they have to they have to act like this they have to be sober they're not joking all the time they have to be sound in faith that to live a life of self control their net you don't overeat they don't self indulge and do all kinds of things they're they they brought their body under subjection to the Word of God I'm just using that as one example overeating you know they got to be temper they don't smoke they don't drink you don't I mean they're they have self-control they don't joke around too much you know they're they're very seriously they love the Lord and I see them give it charity there they're kind they're loving and they're patient they can wait for God to fulfill his word so that's where our our brothers want to get sharpened by somebody they've got to find someone who's more experienced in the Lord and think about they've got to live the right kind of life verse 3 now here's for our sisters the aged women likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things so there's the qualifications verse 4 that they may teach the younger women to be sober to love their husbands so if our younger sisters say I'm having trouble loving my husband I'm having trouble being sober and serious I'm having trouble next is loving my children if sisters need any mentoring with that they should pray and find an older sister on who to approach about that that's what the real Church of God has to be discreet chaste keepers at the home good obedient to their own husband's I'm having trouble guiding my home I'm having trouble obeying my husband can I talk to your sister that the Word of God be not blasphemed look at young men verse 6 young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded you ever see that young men have a trouble being serious you ever seen that young men there they're just so carefree and they just they live they might have been baptized in Jesus name but they just live anyway they don't take care of their money they're not even looking for a wife they're not saving to get a house someday they're just so carefree and the Bible said they need to talk to a godly man they need to be sober they need mean more serious and walking the fear of God don't waste your time redeem the time that right let's say our feet by God's grace so that's why Whitter should have mentoring now you know I know you can't force anybody to learn you can't force the horse to drink if you take it to the water but you can take it to the water and I'll say like this it's getting more and more rare to find young men or young women that really want to learn the things of God it just just rare more rare all the time you don't find a lot of people that want to be instructed well this is how you need to live your life according the Word of God they think they can just figure it out because they're so wise which is probably worldly wisdom but this is the design God has in his church and it's the same design that God had for Solomon Solomon had to sit down with his son say son this is how my father David taught me this is how you need to live your life and that's what the Church of the Living God needs to do how many know the Bible says when you hide when you correct someone it's hiding a multitude of sin how many want to be used of God to do that I do I want God to use me to come along and send me a younger brother or send me a young young sister someone that that will receive the instruction of God maybe in a godly meeting or something and I want to tell them what to do in order so they can avoid the pitfalls of Satan I want to direct men away from violent boys from gangs right I've tried to do that the last few years I've tried to direct people away from gangs right away from drugs some of them still go back and do the drugs but I try to direct them away from that and give them the wisdom of God to live the right life how many want to have a wise countenance that they can sharpen somebody else's countenance amen and we know that countenance comes through prayer through seeking God obtaining the wisdom of God yourself and then you can sharpen somebody else let's just pray for that tonight let's pray that God will help us to have sharpen countenances right here that we can be a blessing to somebody else remember you can't force somebody to be a mentor you can't force somebody to try to force them to do what's right but you can sharpen them you can sharpen them just through your countenance praise the Lord let's just bow our heads here for word of Prayer let's pray that God will give us a countenance of happiness a countenance of peace a countenance of wisdom not a countenance of depression or sadness or defeated nakhon tynin s' that's wise it's shining brighter all the time that we can sharpen the countenance of others let's pray for that pray with me if you would by the grace of Lord Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight we're grateful

we're so privileged to look back and be able to look back and say 3,000 years ago Solomon sat down with his son and said I'm teaching you what my father David taught me the man after God's own heart Oh Lord let us be men and women after the heart of God today we can take these wise words and we can plant them in the hearts of the children for the next generation if there is another generation we
