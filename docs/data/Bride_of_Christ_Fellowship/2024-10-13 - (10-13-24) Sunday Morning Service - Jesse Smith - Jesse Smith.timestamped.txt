[0:39] hold on eternal life where unto Thou Art
[0:43] also called and H has professed a good
[0:46] profession before many witnesses may God
[0:49] add his Blessing to ring of his word you
[0:51] can be seated
[0:54] there so I'd like to just briefly here
[0:57] uh case if you could switch over just
[1:00] want to go over the seven major Visions
[1:01] I I saw I was watching part of the
[1:04] sermon last night at uh Louisiana they
[1:07] have their fall
[1:09] meetings and uh I was
[1:12] watching I was watching the sermon and
[1:14] Pastor Tim puit mentioned this and I
[1:16] thought it was a good reminder with the
[1:17] driverless cars U brother brand had
[1:19] seven major visions of 1933 now of
[1:21] course this wasn't on tape he said uh he
[1:24] got the Visions on the morning when he
[1:26] was going to dedicate the
[1:28] Tabernacle and uh he said it was was a
[1:30] spring morning and of course in those
[1:32] days I don't think he had a recorder in
[1:34] 1933 um so he prophesied these and uh he
[1:38] said he said such sharp things that uh
[1:41] he said he was threatened with arrest
[1:43] because of what he said about these
[1:44] first three he was threatened with
[1:47] arrest but of course God protected him
[1:49] and uh you know uh I proved it I I found
[1:52] a quote brother brah was in the 1960s
[1:54] and he says who remembers who is here uh
[1:57] when I first prophesied those in 1933 he
[1:59] said oh look at the hands there was a
[2:00] couple hands so 30 years after brother R
[2:04] prophesied them there were still a few
[2:06] people that were could say I was there
[2:08] when he said it and you can hear him say
[2:10] amens that's what I shared with all
[2:12] those who doubt the message they I said
[2:14] brother B had witnesses there Hallelujah
[2:17] now um look at this this is from 20 this
[2:19] is from 2015 I preached this look at
[2:21] that now we got
[2:23] Cala but you know I now church I I i'
[2:26] I've been attacked I've been mocked and
[2:28] ridic ridiculed because I only believe
[2:30] the first three are fulfilled and that's
[2:31] fine people can believe whatever they
[2:33] want wherever you take a stand you're
[2:34] going to get criticized brother man said
[2:36] if you're not being criticized
[2:37] something's wrong because the devil is
[2:40] going to be after you if you're doing
[2:41] what's right Hallelujah so if you don't
[2:43] have any critics brother man said that's
[2:45] not a good sign and even Jesus said that
[2:46] if all men Praise You something's wrong
[2:49] I'm paraphrasing that verse anyways the
[2:52] reason I say I I didn't believe the
[2:53] fourth was fulfilled was because these
[2:56] these prophecies were so detailed
[2:59] everyone in the world could not deny a
[3:02] single detail of
[3:04] them right and so uh so that's why I I
[3:09] never believe the fourth was actually
[3:11] fulfilled yet because if it was like the
[3:13] other three it would be undeniable and
[3:15] if this if this last one is fulfilled
[3:17] it's going to be nuclear that's going to
[3:19] be undeniable right undeniable if uh
[3:23] when it's
[3:24] fulfilled okay so that's why I believe
[3:26] we we're only at the third that's what I
[3:29] believe and I could be wrong now there
[3:30] are quotes where brother Bram says he he
[3:32] thinks some of these are fulfilled right
[3:34] but I even showed you a quote from no it
[3:36] was uh November 63 where brother said
[3:38] it's not a woman that's going to rule he
[3:40] said it's a
[3:41] church so we have quotes on both sides
[3:44] it could be a woman a vice president or
[3:45] president he said but in one quote he
[3:47] says it's not a woman it's a church it's
[3:50] the Roman Catholic church so it's just
[3:52] like the Bible it's just like Zechariah
[3:54] God showed Zechariah all these dreams
[3:56] and the angel said do you know what
[3:58] these mean he's like no Lord you know
[4:01] right they're giving Visions they just
[4:02] say what the vision showed and then
[4:05] brother R would spend the rest of his
[4:06] life trying to say well this looks like
[4:07] it that what is he trying to do he's
[4:09] getting trying to get the people ready
[4:10] for the Rapture amen amen right we're
[4:12] just trying to look and see uh the
[4:14] Fulfillment of scripture you know we had
[4:17] a a good brother uh I maybe I shouldn't
[4:20] call his name I won't call his name but
[4:22] he a good brother used to come to our
[4:23] church and he he came to me and said
[4:25] brother Jesse he
[4:26] said he said uh brother Ram uh was
[4:29] quoting Matthew 24 and where Jesus said
[4:33] all these things will come to pass and
[4:35] the generation shall not pass that sees
[4:37] these things come to pass and that was
[4:39] the Fig Tree putting forth its buds
[4:41] right and brother Braham said that was
[4:42] fulfilled in the church age book right
[4:44] so brother Braham said a generation or
[4:46] Jesus said a generation won't pass till
[4:48] all these things are fulfilled so the
[4:49] brother asked me this was back in 20
[4:51] would have been 2015 again right along
[4:52] when I preached this and he said do you
[4:55] think brother Ram meant that
[4:56] prophetically and I said no because
[4:57] there's no thus sayith the Lord behind
[4:59] it
[5:00] because it's it's been how many years
[5:02] right since Israel has been a nation it
[5:04] was 1948 when they became a nation we
[5:07] passed many we passed more than a
[5:09] generation brother brandham had his
[5:11] son's rise right Joseph Billy Paul
[5:13] Joseph is an old man now he's he's
[5:16] almost 69 he'll be 69 this coming year
[5:19] and then he has children and he has
[5:22] grandchildren right so we passed more
[5:24] than one generation and so see what what
[5:26] I'm trying to say is that each man of
[5:28] God is trying to do his best to look at
[5:31] the scripture and see where are we at in
[5:33] Prophecy Hallelujah and we're doing our
[5:36] best but see what what the point I'm
[5:38] making is all these three were so
[5:40] incredibly Vindicated no one can deny
[5:43] them that they happened so with Elon
[5:45] must bringing out his cars this year
[5:47] well elon's looks way better than that
[5:48] one but that does look like a egg shape
[5:50] kind
[5:51] of uh let me go down to the quote here I
[5:55] got all these preaches back in 2015
[5:57] maybe I'll preach this again here
[6:00] it's been quite a while it's good to uh
[6:02] and look back in 2015 I was preaching on
[6:04] Russia with
[6:05] Wars right that's why I knew when these
[6:07] people said oh the sign of Russia and
[6:08] 2023 is a war I knew that wasn't the
[6:11] sign of the Rapture right because
[6:13] they've been go they've been having Wars
[6:15] right that was back in
[6:17] 2015 uh there's a new sheriff in the
[6:19] Middle East Putin uh it's neat to go
[6:21] back and uh it's neat to go back and see
[6:23] how God has guided us amen he's uh spoke
[6:26] to us now the fourth Vision showed a
[6:28] great advances in science that would
[6:29] come after the second world war it was
[6:31] headed up in the vision so the very head
[6:32] of this the very climax of this vision
[6:35] is a plastic bubble toop car that was
[6:37] running down beautiful highways under
[6:40] remote control so that people appeared
[6:42] seated in this car without a steering
[6:44] wheel and that's what elon's cars came
[6:46] out this week no steering
[6:49] wheel and they were playing some sort of
[6:52] a game to Muse Muse themselves and my
[6:53] wife saw it to they had four chairs and
[6:55] the four the two chairs on one side two
[6:57] on the other they're facing each other
[6:59] now they just got to get something in
[7:00] the middle there cuz if the other three
[7:02] were precisely with the vision this it
[7:05] has to happen just that way in this time
[7:07] too every detail of the vision must come
[7:10] to
[7:11] pass oh sorry wrong one I clicked the
[7:14] wrong button and I said just before the
[7:16] time comes that automobiles which was
[7:18] built that old straight back 20 years
[7:20] ago 25 years ago you remember the 20
[7:22] years anyhow I said they look like an
[7:23] egg they'll be shaped that's a vision be
[7:26] something on the shape of something like
[7:27] that so something like the shape of an
[7:29] egg in other words
[7:31] aerodynamic not straight like look at
[7:33] the pictures from the 1920s their cars
[7:35] they were like long rectangular prisms
[7:37] that's just they little top like kind of
[7:39] two like two rectangles on top of each
[7:40] other what do we got today uh he says
[7:44] that's right and that's the way they'll
[7:45] be just before the Rapture amen
[7:49] hallelujah and I said now also to come
[7:51] to pass that before the end time will
[7:52] come automobiles will be taken on the
[7:53] shape of an egg become more like an egg
[7:55] and I saw an American Family driving
[7:56] down a highway in a car like that they
[7:58] were sitting facing one another had a
[8:00] table they're like playing checkers or
[8:01] cars they didn't have any steering wheel
[8:03] in the car and it was controlled by some
[8:05] power without a steering wheel how many
[8:06] members me prophesying that so it's been
[8:09] prophesied Hallelujah and uh Elon said
[8:13] 2026 now we've been following these uh
[8:15] driverless cars now for many years I
[8:18] think they started around 2018 2017
[8:20] somewhere in there uh and the the the
[8:23] the the Google guy said I'll be having
[8:25] my son driverless car by 2020 well look
[8:27] it's been four years that didn't happen
[8:30] so I I'm not saying Elon will be right
[8:31] in 20 2026 but we're just getting closer
[8:35] by God's grace we're getting much closer
[8:37] so it's interesting to see that by God's
[8:39] grace now uh brother said he saw him at
[8:42] the world's fair but remember they had
[8:43] to be driving on American Highway and
[8:46] then there's quotes where brother Ram
[8:46] says they don't even have the highways
[8:49] yet right so brother R there's quotes
[8:51] brother says we don't have the highways
[8:52] yet uh and we haven't seen them yet we
[8:54] haven't seen the every detail the vision
[8:56] come to pass so we're looking for that
[8:58] praise God that's what I'm looking for
[9:00] Hallelujah okay so I just went through
[9:02] and then the fifth
[9:04] Vision I'll just X out of that
[9:06] now so just so you can see
[9:09] that again I believe we're right there
[9:12] and I believe these can come to pass
[9:13] brother Bram said he said all the
[9:15] scriptures that need to be fulfilled
[9:17] before the Rapture he said could come to
[9:18] pass in
[9:20] hours so the scriptures we need to come
[9:23] to pass this this is Advance in science
[9:25] right Daniel prophesied of that
[9:27] Hallelujah the advances in science right
[9:29] increase of knowledge right that's been
[9:31] prophesied the moral problem around
[9:33] women right uh and that was headed up in
[9:36] a woman just wearing a fig Leaf over her
[9:38] uh loin
[9:40] area right nothing on the top that was
[9:42] headed up and this was headed up in a
[9:43] woman ruling with a iron Rod Over
[9:46] America now we don't like to say it but
[9:49] that's why I voted I voted this week I
[9:50] did an absente ballot I hope you'll vote
[9:52] too because we don't know we can we
[9:54] could Escape Our Generation hallelujah
[9:56] our generation could Escape that's why I
[9:58] vote Hallelujah
[10:00] and people died so we could vote that's
[10:01] another reason I vote men and women died
[10:03] so we could have these Liberties
[10:05] Hallelujah and then of course uh the
[10:07] bomb now I don't know where that is in
[10:08] the scripture uh because the Beast out
[10:10] of the land is revelation 13 the Beast
[10:13] lays down the mark but then we don't
[10:14] hear anything more about the Beast so
[10:17] don't not I'm not quite sure where in
[10:18] the scripture the Beast is destroyed I
[10:21] don't know but I'm going to keep
[10:22] searching hallelujah it's got to be in
[10:24] there somewhere Hallelujah because it's
[10:25] thus sayith the Lord hallelujah now so
[10:29] we we see kind of where we are uh by the
[10:31] grace of God now I'm going to switch
[10:33] over uh you can just put some scriptures
[10:35] up here and uh in a little bit I'll
[10:37] switch back over okay because I have
[10:38] some I want to show something here uh by
[10:41] God's grace kind of ties in with the the
[10:44] sermon today all right that's that's my
[10:46] introduction that's not my sermon I
[10:48] haven't started preaching yet this is
[10:50] now my start of my preaching Hallelujah
[10:52] so I want to preach on be a hero you
[10:54] know months ago I that's kind of how I I
[10:56] operate I'll catch an inspired thought
[10:58] and then I'll just email it to myself s
[10:59] and that email will just sit in my inbox
[11:01] until I start going through looking for
[11:03] some inspiration and then I'll preach it
[11:05] kind of like uh the God who sees on
[11:07] Wednesday night that email sat in my
[11:09] inbox for two months until I preached it
[11:11] I just look for the right inspiration at
[11:13] the right time so did this email uh two
[11:16] months ago I heard brother brandom say
[11:18] be a
[11:19] hero what is a hero who knows what a
[11:21] hero is it's an illustrious Warrior so a
[11:26] warrior who has many amazing
[11:28] accomplishments who's fought many
[11:30] battles another def definition is a
[11:33] person admired for achievements and
[11:36] Noble
[11:37] qualities remember don't have to be
[11:39] great achievements of the world it's got
[11:41] to be achievements in the spiritual
[11:43] realm
[11:43] hallelujah it's not great achievements
[11:46] in the world because the Bible calls
[11:47] that foolishness I read through 1
[11:49] Corinthians uh chapters 1 through 4
[11:50] yesterday and the Bible talks about the
[11:52] foolishness of The World God has made it
[11:54] foolishness the world right God makes
[11:56] them fools and uh and God's people are
[11:59] wise Hallelujah so we see that it's it's
[12:02] a hero who's admired for achievements
[12:05] and Noble qualities so what better
[12:07] qualities could there be than the
[12:08] character of Jesus Christ that's a hero
[12:11] someone who has the character of Jesus
[12:14] Christ it's one who shows great courage
[12:17] so I just looked at uh Webster's
[12:19] Dictionary and those were the the three
[12:20] there's like five definitions those are
[12:22] the three that I think apply to us
[12:24] hallelujah so church we want to have
[12:26] great courage Hallelujah we want to have
[12:28] the noble qualities in other words we
[12:30] want to have the character of
[12:31] Christ and we want to achieve something
[12:34] for the glory of God what did Paul say
[12:36] Paul said I fought a good fight he said
[12:39] I fought the fight of Faith Hallelujah
[12:42] so we can see Paul was a hero he fought
[12:46] to give the faith to others to share the
[12:48] Faith with others and he also fought
[12:50] that he would keep the
[12:52] faith in the face of blasphemy because
[12:54] he did it ignorantly Hallelujah and then
[12:57] God empowered him God said in a Ministry
[13:00] God called him in a Ministry that Jesus
[13:02] might reveal himself in Paul hallelujah
[13:05] amen what is the will of God for your
[13:07] life that Christ would reveal himself in
[13:09] your life Hallelujah in other words that
[13:11] you would be Christ for somebody
[13:13] else
[13:16] Hallelujah and we don't want to miss
[13:18] just the Simplicity of it that we could
[13:20] uh manifest Christ to the people around
[13:23] us that's all God's asking us to do
[13:25] right is Manifest Jesus Christ to the
[13:27] people around us hallelujah what did
[13:30] Jesus say the greatest among you were
[13:32] the richest no do you say the greatest
[13:35] among you were the smartest everybody
[13:37] see where I'm going the greatest among
[13:39] you were the handsomest or the prettiest
[13:41] no the greatest among you were the
[13:45] servants someone who tried to help
[13:48] somebody's life and make it a little
[13:50] better
[13:52] Hallelujah so see it's it's so it's so
[13:54] easy to be I should say God's made it so
[13:56] easy so we can be heroes all we got do
[13:59] is open our eyes and open our ears and
[14:01] look at people around us who needs help
[14:03] I'll step in and help them now you're a
[14:06] hero right hallelujah
[14:09] amen Jesus said it's not going to be so
[14:12] that you rule and you Lord over the
[14:14] people he said but the greatest among
[14:15] you should be the servants amen
[14:18] hallelujah that's what the scripture
[14:20] tells us hallelujah and so we're
[14:22] thankful for the word of God it's been
[14:23] so been so precious to us how many want
[14:26] to be a servant praise God yeah thank
[14:27] you man okay
[14:30] yeah so we walked in here sorry it was
[14:32] kind of hot in here we walked in here it
[14:33] was cold my children were cold so I
[14:35] cranked up the heat and then we all come
[14:36] in here and now we're super hot so let's
[14:38] go back down to cold so forgive me now I
[14:41] want to just I want to just do a few
[14:43] minutes on Peter I I didn't get to all
[14:45] the scriptures on Peter from two
[14:46] Wednesdays ago I sure enjoyed that that
[14:48] was such a blessing to me uh to see how
[14:50] God redeemed brother Peter
[14:53] Hallelujah Glory now let me I got a
[14:55] little note here I want to pull up yeah
[14:57] Mal I found a good note from scoffield I
[14:58] want to pull up he come right after
[14:59] service said Daddy look at this note I
[15:02] don't know if he called me Daddy but he
[15:03] called me dad Daddy's the old way he
[15:05] used to say it when he was little but
[15:07] remember Peter was uh and I want you to
[15:10] think about this think of how Peter
[15:12] became a hero church if Peter be could
[15:15] could become a hero any of us could
[15:16] become a
[15:18] hero I don't know if you heard
[15:21] me if Peter became a hero any of us
[15:25] could be a hero that's a little
[15:27] better just
[15:29] because of the the depths of failure
[15:31] that he failed
[15:33] to there could be there there could uh
[15:36] be very few depths fall as low as Peter
[15:41] fell
[15:43] right I mean Abraham lied right he lied
[15:46] on God he lied about his wife he laughed
[15:49] at God but Abraham never walked in his
[15:51] way and said I don't even know God I
[15:52] don't even know I don't even know him
[15:56] that's what Peter did Peter said I don't
[15:58] even know the Lord Jesus I have no idea
[16:02] who he is imagine if that happened to
[16:05] you on your job somebody said are you
[16:06] one of those message Holy Ghost
[16:08] Believers no I don't even know Pastor
[16:10] Jesse who who what Pastor what I don't
[16:13] even know that guy that guy's who most
[16:16] people say who but you know put your
[16:18] name in there brother
[16:20] V you go to brother vang's church I
[16:22] don't even know him
[16:25] who I mean that's the depths of
[16:28] depravity that that Peter fell into amen
[16:31] but God never left him there
[16:33] Hallelujah and church no matter where
[16:35] you fall you don't have to stay there
[16:37] Hallelujah God's writing a story
[16:40] hallelujah hallelujah be a hero
[16:44] Hallelujah but remember Peter started
[16:46] his life it was a hopeless life so he
[16:48] started if if there's an arc L told me
[16:50] about stories have
[16:52] arcs so I'm going to learn some new
[16:54] language
[16:55] now stories have arcs so if you if you
[16:57] look at Peter's Arc it started low he
[16:59] was hopeless just a fisherman there was
[17:01] no uh big retirement for fisherman in
[17:03] those days the retirement was we put you
[17:05] the six feet under the
[17:07] ground right that's your
[17:09] retirement you don't get to relax and
[17:11] well oh no now I'm now I'm living free
[17:13] no they were under the Roman government
[17:16] and taxes kept going up and the church

[18:22] Hallelujah we saw Peter was naturally
[18:24] impulsive he was a spur of the- moment
[18:27] kind of guy and sometimes that word
[18:28] worked out for him really good sometimes
[18:30] it
[18:32] didn't but see God works with all of us
[18:34] with our personal uh
[18:38] personality brother random said you know

[19:30] know he knows where we're at on the
[19:31] Rapture
[19:33] timeline don't you think he knows where
[19:35] we are in those seven major Visions I'm
[19:36] not saying I'm right I'm just saying God
[19:39] knows all things we we we uh we see
[19:41] through a glass Darkly amen but one day
[19:44] brother CLA Hallelujah one day uh
[19:46] brother Patrick one day we'll see Jesus

[19:50] know even as we're known of
[19:54] him we'll get a new name too Hallelujah
[19:59] I I like my name because it's a Bible
[20:00] name but if you don't like your name

[20:04] you you know he was so impulsive he went
[20:07] he he went uh you know he went from let
[20:09] me walk on the water to Fallen till he
[20:11] walked back to the
[20:13] boat he went to uh he went to sing a
[20:16] vision then saying let's build three
[20:17] Tabernacles and then Jesus or God's
[20:20] voice stopped him right there and said
[20:21] we're not building a denomination around
[20:23] here hallelujah and then he was so uh
[20:26] spontaneous he jumped into the sea after
[20:28] the resurrection but make sure he put on
[20:29] his clothes before he jumped on the sea
[20:32] he had to get those modest clothes on
[20:33] before he went to church
[20:35] Hallelujah and I appreciate I want to
[20:37] appreciate that you know when I preach
[20:38] that we had some guests here and I just
[20:39] want to thank I just want to thank the
[20:41] church you know when we have guests here
[20:42] I really try to uh I try not to go so
[20:45] deep in certain aspects of the message
[20:48] because I know they can't handle it
[20:50] right and I'm trying to ad minister to
[20:52] them so I appreciate you know how you
[20:53] everybody's real patient with me I'm
[20:55] just I just try to be led by the Holy
[20:57] Spirit CU I know when I first come in
[20:59] the message uh brother van almost every
[21:01] sermon was going over my head I couldn't
[21:02] catch much of it so I want to be a
[21:04] little bit I want to be balanced I want
[21:06] to give the the people that have been
[21:07] here a while I want to give them some
[21:08] deep things but also I want to make sure
[21:10] I give some food I want to give some
[21:11] morsels to our newcomers by God's grace
[21:15] right like those uh Paige and her mom
[21:17] remember that and those girls are so
[21:19] sweet and church she come up for prayer
[21:21] weeping saying pray for me I need to be
[21:23] healed you know so she trusted me that
[21:25] much after just a humble sermon where I
[21:26] tried to just balance it out you know
[21:28] not I didn't say brother Ram said
[21:29] brother bam said brother Ram said
[21:30] brother said brother I didn't say that I
[21:33] tried to balance it out by God's grace
[21:36] so I'm thankful that you're patient with
[21:37] me and you try to understand that and I
[21:38] I know you are but I just want to take a
[21:40] moment and thank you for understanding
[21:41] that I try to be sensitive to who's here
[21:45] and uh give give them something that
[21:47] they could receive as
[21:49] well and then uh Peter went from saying
[21:52] Lord you're not going to wash me at all
[21:53] you'll never wash me to wash all of me
[21:56] amen how many say Jesus wash all of me
[21:59] amen he went from uh he went he went
[22:02] from saying you've got the keys you've
[22:04] got a revelation to get behind me
[22:07] Satan pretty spontaneous isn't it quite
[22:10] a quite a
[22:11] change you got the keys brother but then
[22:14] brother get behind me
[22:16] Satan it's it was just such a a such a
[22:20] up and down type of
[22:23] experience but brother Ram said see the
[22:25] reason he did this because he had not
[22:26] been up to Pentecost
[22:29] but Ram said when he went up to
[22:30] Pentecost he put on the full armor of
[22:32] God hallelujah so see church and look
[22:35] and I just thought it was so special
[22:37] Peter wrote this over here and remember
[22:40] on the night of the Betrayal he lost
[22:43] this he lost all this he lost this the
[22:45] only thing he had left was this and he
[22:46] even said he denied that and who's the
[22:49] one that wrote this Peter Peter knew
[22:51] what it's like to gain the anointing and
[22:53] lose the anointing Peter knew that and
[22:56] the only reason brother Austin he stayed
[22:58] is because Jesus said I prayed for you
[23:00] that your faith wouldn't fail hallelujah
[23:03] amen that's the only reason cuz
[23:05] everything else he lost he wasn't
[23:07] concerned about his brother wasn't even
[23:08] concerned about his Lord he lost his
[23:10] patience right he took that sword and
[23:11] tried to cut off malus's ear he lost
[23:14] everything knowledge he I don't know
[23:16] Jesus I I'm not one of them he lost his
[23:19] virtue he couldn't stand up publicly
[23:20] right virtue he couldn't stand up
[23:22] publicly and be a real
[23:24] believer he lost all that but then he
[23:27] says that's the way you get right with
[23:29] God you build those anointings amen you
[23:31] go from glory to glory amen from
[23:34] anointing to anointing until you're
[23:36] capped off and he was capped off on the
[23:38] day of Pentecost and then he had on the
[23:41] armor of God
[23:43] hallelujah amen but don't forget all the
[23:46] good things he had power over Devils he
[23:48] had revelation of the of of Christ from
[23:50] the father he made those two notable
[23:53] statements uh he he uh he gave us he
[23:57] gave us some of the most beautiful uh
[24:00] statements that could ever be made he
[24:02] said to whom shall we go thou Hast the
[24:04] words of eternal life I still quote that
[24:08] today when people say you're G to leave
[24:09] the message I'm like where am I going to
[24:11] go of course I'm not going to leave the
[24:14] message the message came to me I didn't
[24:16] go looking for the message God came to
[24:17] me Hallelujah some of you were blessed
[24:20] notice some of you were blessed to be
[24:21] born in it now don't
[24:23] leave I wasn't born in it God brought me
[24:26] in it Hallelujah you're blessed if
[24:28] you're bornn in it I wish I would have
[24:30] been born in it praise God it would have
[24:31] saved me a lot of Heartache amen but God
[24:34] has a testimony God's got a story for me
[24:36] God's got a story for
[24:40] you so Peter was used to say two of the
[24:44] most beautiful
[24:46] notable statements that's ever been
[24:48] uttered
[24:50] Hallelujah Upon This Rock I'll build my
[24:52] church of course that was Jesus telling
[24:54] that but then he
[24:56] also uh he also had the most worst
[25:00] cowardly denial of Faith also think
[25:04] about that he had the greatest words and
[25:07] then also some of the most cowardly
[25:09] words everybody see the contrast did you
[25:12] ever see that in your life some days
[25:14] you're on the Mountaintop some days
[25:15] you're lower than a skunk's belly
[25:19] right Peter has some of the most quoted
[25:22] words Upon This Rock I'll build my
[25:24] church where will we go thou has the
[25:26] words of eternal life but he's also got
[25:28] the lowest words I don't even know the
[25:30] man no I don't know
[25:32] him see sometimes our life is a life of
[25:35] contrast it would be nice right brother
[25:38] Claude if everything was always good all
[25:40] the time it'd be nice if you never made
[25:42] any mistakes right brother Patrick I'll
[25:45] just use you guys up here right Mali
[25:47] it'd be nice if you never made a mistake
[25:48] but the reality of it is sometimes we
[25:50] embarrass
[25:51] ourselves sometimes we don't make a good
[25:53] real good Christian testimony but is
[25:55] that the end of the story no it's just
[25:57] the beginning praise
[25:59] God Peter had both highs and lows and
[26:02] imagine his Lydia I imagine his story
[26:04] arc was one of these but I'm going I'm
[26:05] just going to give a generalization of
[26:07] it though I'm just going to give a
[26:07] general you're going to see it in a
[26:08] little bit because this is all inspired
[26:10] thanks to you
[26:12] hun of course and all the things I've
[26:14] been studying so he has some of the
[26:16] greatest statements but he also has some
[26:17] of the most embarrassing statements
[26:20] cowardly denying that c he even knew
[26:24] Christ imagine
[26:27] that so see church it's it's it's
[26:29] something we have to keep in mind and
[26:31] remember God used him in some of the
[26:32] greatest ways 3,000 Souls saved he gave
[26:35] the the key to the Jews Gentiles
[26:38] Samaritans he raised a paralyzed man at
[26:40] the gate of
[26:42] beautiful now we'd all like to do that
[26:44] but would you also like to deny Christ
[26:46] in front of your family and go through
[26:48] that pain and
[26:49] suffering I wouldn't want to deny
[26:52] Christ you know his shadow I think I did
[26:54] that with me where's my
[26:56] shadow yeah here's my
[26:59] he just he just went through my shadow
[27:00] there's my shadow is that okay
[27:02] buddy a man would just a sick man would
[27:05] be in the shadow of Peter and he'd rise
[27:07] up and get healed Hallelujah but he also
[27:09] had to go through the dark days those
[27:11] days of denial of
[27:14] Christ such amazing highs such amazing
[27:16] testimonies but such a low
[27:19] fall God has a story God's got a story
[27:23] for
[27:23] you my prayer is God help me not to fall
[27:27] hallelujah amen amen but God's got to
[27:29] let some people fall to show his grace
[27:31] Amen to show his Amazing Grace
[27:34] Hallelujah that you can't fall too far
[27:37] from the hand of God if you're an elect
[27:39] child of God you can't fall too far but
[27:41] what God will pick you up and raise you
[27:43] up
[27:44] hallelujah amen he raised Tabitha from
[27:47] the
[27:48] dead by the power of God hallelujah and
[27:52] then he wrote two Epistles and showed us
[27:54] the way for charity the way to show the
[27:56] love of Christ you know what we need
[27:59] Church you know what you need more
[28:00] anointing you know what I need more
[28:03] anointing Hallelujah that's what we need
[28:05] Hallelujah Peter says and Peter says if
[28:08] we don't live in that anointing we start
[28:10] forgetting am I forgiven or not am I a
[28:12] Christian or not am I a real believer or
[28:14] not am I going in the Rapture or not
[28:16] when the church
[28:17] said if we don't keep adding that
[28:19] anointing I'm talking to our human
[28:20] Spirit now your soul is capped off with
[28:22] Charity your Soul's capped off with that
[28:25] uh that Soul can never sin 1 John 3:9
[28:28] the seed of God remains you it cannot
[28:30] sin but in your mind you got to keep
[28:32] that anointing in your mind or else
[28:34] you're going to forget who you are
[28:36] Hallelujah you're the bride of Christ
[28:38] amen you're the children of God you're
[28:41] God's beloved
[28:42] Hallelujah you are heirs to all of God's
[28:45] covenant promises amen and God will
[28:49] never break a covenant brother Vang
[28:50] hallelujah it's impossible
[28:53] Hallelujah God can never break a promise
[28:55] Hallelujah
[28:58] he said the New Covenant he said I'll
[29:00] write the word of God I'll write it on
[29:02] the fleshly tables of your heart how
[29:03] many got the word on your hearts today
[29:05] Hallelujah that's his promise amen he
[29:09] said I'll do that by the blood of Jesus
[29:11] Christ I'll let the spirit of God write
[29:13] the word of God upon the fleshly tables
[29:16] of your heart so you'll be a written
[29:18] epistle known and read of all men you're
[29:21] a letter of recommendation that this
[29:23] word is real Hallelujah the Gospel of
[29:26] Jesus Christ is the most powerful thing
[29:28] on the face of the Earth Hallelujah is
[29:31] that right glory and what's the greatest
[29:35] expression of it
[29:38] love it's love Peter was uh this one I
[29:42] didn't go over Peter was very
[29:43] self-sacrificing Mark
[29:46] 1:18 Jesus walked by Peter and said I'm
[29:49] going to make you a fisher of men Mark
[29:50] 1118 and straightway they forsook their
[29:52] Nets and foued him look he's in the
[29:53] middle of work it's it's like Austin
[29:55] he's in the middle of dog training all
[29:57] of a sudden Jesus come around said
[29:58] follow me he's like all right uh can you
[29:59] guys take the dogs see
[30:02] you right he's like in the middle of
[30:04] pulling the Nets and uh you younger guys
[30:07] take these nuts I'm going with Jesus
[30:09] spur of the
[30:10] moment that worked out for him that time
[30:14] Hallelujah right he could do that he
[30:16] could say I'm leaving this I'm done I'm
[30:18] following
[30:20] Jesus see this was the kind of faith
[30:22] that he had this when when when it was
[30:24] anointed my it was so
[30:26] powerful but when he lost said anointing
[30:28] it was disgraceful and I'm saying that
[30:30] for me too all of us when that anointing
[30:33] of our mind leaves church we can be
[30:34] disgraceful to the name of Christ but
[30:37] that doesn't mean the story's over
[30:39] Hallelujah it doesn't mean that
[30:41] Hallelujah and you don't want to get in
[30:43] a spot where Satan beat you up over
[30:44] things like that you got to remember his
[30:47] grace the Bible said he's rich in Mercy
[30:51] the Bible said he forgives all
[30:54] iniquities Hallelujah that that's the
[30:56] worst one that would affect us is
[30:57] Iniquity cuz we know what we did wrong
[30:59] but the David said blessed is a man whom
[31:01] the Lord will not impute iniquities
[31:03] Hallelujah if anybody knew iniquity it
[31:06] was David
[31:08] Hallelujah Matthew 19:27 honey can you
[31:10] pull this up
[31:12] here seem like I can't get my glasses
[31:14] clean too much
[31:17] sweat so we see that he was so uh he was
[31:20] so self-sacrificing at times but then
[31:24] other times he was concerned about the
[31:26] rewards and I've always wondered I've
[31:28] heard preachers say this I've always
[31:29] wondered how did Peter say Matthew
[31:31] 19:27 did I get get the wrong
[31:36] one there you go Jesus is talking about
[31:39] all the rewards you that the apostles
[31:41] are going to get no I'm sorry he was
[31:43] talking about all the rewards the Rich
[31:44] Young Ruler could have got but then
[31:45] Peter answered and said behold we've
[31:47] forsaken
[31:49] everything he in other words I left my
[31:51] wife I left my
[31:53] job to preach just to preach and go from
[31:56] town to town and live off the offerings
[31:59] of these women think about that they
[32:00] were living off the offerings of the
[32:01] women Joanna and different
[32:03] ones I left my my moneymaking business I
[32:06] left my income we forsaken all and we
[32:09] follow thee what shall we have therefore
[32:11] so I wonder how he asked this did he ask
[32:13] it real humble like Lord we've less or
[32:14] they ask Lord what do we get sometimes
[32:17] that's what we get God when am I going
[32:19] to get my blessing when I've done all
[32:21] this I imagine it was the second one but
[32:25] I don't know I hope it was the humble
[32:26] way but it doesn't matter because we all
[32:29] because you it doesn't matter because
[32:30] Jesus answered the way he did look at
[32:33] the answer Jesus gives and Jesus said to
[32:36] them verily I say to you truly that ye
[32:39] which have followed me in the
[32:40] Regeneration Glory the Millennium when
[32:42] the son of man shall sit on the throne
[32:43] of his glory ye shall sit upon 12
[32:45] Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[32:49] what do we get Lord you get a future
[32:51] reward not so much now right now he said
[32:54] they would get a hundredfold of friends
[32:55] but look look what his life ended he
[32:57] ended as a martyr
[32:58] it wasn't a happy luxurious picnic kind
[33:00] of
[33:02] life look what he got
[33:04] here Jesus so it doesn't matter how
[33:07] Peter asked it maybe it was real sincere
[33:09] maybe it was a little selfish but Jesus
[33:11] tells him here's what you're going to
[33:12] get if you follow because you've left
[33:14] everything you're going to judge in the
[33:16] Millennium Church no wonder brother R
[33:18] said we we don't even understand how
[33:19] important it is to live in the
[33:21] Millennium you get to live if you
[33:23] overcome now you get to live as a leader
[33:26] in the millennium
[33:28] people are are going people are going to
[33:29] be looking up to you in a better way
[33:31] than look up to you know Mike dwine or
[33:33] uh you know Bo Joe Biden or Camala or
[33:35] Trump or whoever it is or Barack Obama
[33:38] God is going to make the believer
[33:40] something like that but greater because
[33:44] most of these men are corrupt most of
[33:45] these women are corrupt but you won't be
[33:47] corrupt because you'll be in a brand new
[33:48] body Hallelujah a perfect glorified body
[33:52] hallelujah amen that cannot sin and this
[33:55] is the promise you've forsaken all
[33:57] because you've suffered a little in this
[33:59] life the next life is going to be so
[34:03] amazing remember the Bible said if we
[34:05] can just suffer through our light
[34:07] burdens right then we then we'll be able
[34:09] to understand the Eternal weight of
[34:12] Glory so what's the weight of Glory for
[34:14] him you get to sit and judge 12 tribes
[34:17] for a thousand years you're the judge
[34:20] because you saw the word of God you left
[34:22] everything to support the word of God
[34:24] and God can use that character to rule
[34:26] in the future millennial
[34:28] hallelujah
[34:30] amen now I want to go through uh seven
[34:33] scriptures uh I found this in
[34:36] uh I found this in the Thompson Chain
[34:38] concordance brother R said he wished he
[34:40] he said he always had a scoffield Bible
[34:42] he wished he would have had a Thompson
[34:43] Chain concordance because he said he
[34:44] could have found the Bible studies
[34:45] faster I don't know if you've seen that
[34:47] video I put out lately but that was good
[34:49] so uh let let's start this Thompson
[34:50] Chain look listen Church there's seven
[34:52] steps in Peter's fall seven steps and at
[34:56] any time he could have repented of
[34:59] that right
[35:01] anytime so think about the moments where
[35:03] you've struggled there was many warning
[35:05] signs there's there there's at least six
[35:07] warning signs he could have he could
[35:09] have found out he could have said oh no
[35:11] God forgive me I'm coming back but
[35:13] there's seven steps to his
[35:16] fall the first one is conceit Matthew
[35:20] 26:33 Matthew
[35:23] 26:33 maybe I can oh you're fast good
[35:26] job Peter answered said to him though
[35:28] all men shall be offended because of
[35:29] thee yet will I never be offended and we
[35:32] know just a few hours later he was
[35:36] offended right I always stand for this
[35:39] message I'll never deny brother Rand I
[35:41] always believe the truth of the Gospel
[35:43] will
[35:44] you be careful some of these guys I've
[35:47] heard around the message not our church
[35:48] but other churches they said I know I'm
[35:50] going to live to the Rapture I've been
[35:51] watching their lives because they're
[35:52] getting up there they're in their 60s
[35:54] they said they got it one guy at cam
[35:55] Church uh he left cam church one guy
[35:57] there said uh God revealed to me I'm I'm
[35:59] I'm not going to die I'm going to go in
[36:00] the Rapture well guess what I'm watching
[36:02] his life and the way he's lived already
[36:04] I don't think he's telling the truth
[36:06] because a tree is known by its fruit but
[36:08] look at these boasts what does it start
[36:09] off with a
[36:10] boast I I'll do
[36:13] this right conceit
[36:16] Pride right and pride goeth before
[36:19] the next is uh Matthew
[36:23] 26:40 after conceit he gets an ease he
[36:27] says would could you not watch with with
[36:29] me one hour so first he's Pride prideful
[36:32] and then he can't pray for Jesus like he
[36:35] ought
[36:37] to and Jesus even says you know I wanted
[36:39] you to pray for me he said but you
[36:41] should have prayed that you had not got
[36:42] into temptation so here because he's
[36:45] prideful and he's too lazy or tired here
[36:48] he he misses his chance to overcome the
[36:52] Temptation because that's what Pride
[36:54] does it makes you lazy on God well I'm
[36:56] the greatest of all time you have to
[36:57] pray tonight don't have to pray tomorrow
[36:59] don't have to read your
[37:00] Bible see how Pride does that to
[37:03] you that's why I love that example from
[37:05] Mark chapter 1 right after Jesus healed
[37:07] an entire multitude the Bible said he
[37:09] got up very early in the morning to go
[37:11] pray to his father that's one of the
[37:13] most beautiful verses about humility in
[37:15] other words you could have a whole day
[37:16] of Miracles but what would you do the
[37:18] first the next morning Jesus got up
[37:20] early and went to go
[37:22] pray that's the key to to to uh service
[37:25] right humble not being proud PR prideful
[37:29] conceited at ease the next is rashness
[37:32] John 1810 And1 John 18101 so first he
[37:36] was conceited prideful then he was at
[37:38] ease little lazy didn't want to pray
[37:41] then next is rash then Simon Peter
[37:43] having a sword drew it smokee the high
[37:45] priest servant cut off his right ear the
[37:46] servant's name was malus then said Jesus
[37:48] unto Peter put up thy sword and thy
[37:50] sheath the cup which my father give me
[37:51] shall I not drink it so we also see
[37:54] violence right he almost killed somebody
[38:00] so it goes from Pride to laziness to
[38:03] Violent anger and murder almost
[38:06] murder just a few hours after saying
[38:08] I'll never leave you Lord I'll never do
[38:09] anything I always stand for
[38:12] you and then now look after this act
[38:15] here of of violence notice he follows a
[38:18] far off so he starts wandering from
[38:21] Jesus he's not close to Jesus he's too
[38:24] afraid to be close to Jesus so he
[38:26] wanders away
[38:28] Matthew
[38:32] 2658 Matthew 26:58 but Peter foued him
[38:36] AAR off under the high priest's Palace
[38:37] and went in and sat with the servants to
[38:39] see the end why wasn't he right up there
[38:40] with the right up with Jesus Lord I'm
[38:42] praying for you Lord I'm right with you
[38:44] you've been with me through every trial
[38:45] I'll be right there but no he's just
[38:46] following just see how close he can get
[38:48] before he gets into
[38:49] trouble see he's distan himself from the
[38:52] word of God God help us to stay true to
[38:54] the word of God
[38:55] Amen look at this Sevenfold fall conceit
[38:59] ease violence rashness falling a far off
[39:02] next is evil associations John 18:18 be
[39:05] careful who you hang around with church
[39:07] be careful who you hang around with
[39:10] sometimes it better to be alone with
[39:11] Jesus than with people that are going to
[39:14] tear your faith down and really when
[39:17] you're with Jesus like I said you're
[39:18] with the majority praise God you're in
[39:20] better company with Jesus than you be
[39:21] with a bunch of
[39:22] Sinners Hallelujah and the Servants of
[39:25] the officer stood there who had made a
[39:26] fire of for it was cold and they warmed
[39:29] themselves and Peter stood with them and
[39:30] warmed himself so see he's he's over
[39:33] with evil associations with all these
[39:35] people that are against Jesus he's in a
[39:37] Jewish home it's Caiaphas his court it's
[39:39] his house and there's an outer Court you
[39:40] know and he's out there with them just
[39:42] warming himself by the fire evil
[39:44] associations see what sin does it puts
[39:46] you with the wrong
[39:48] people you get violent get angry get
[39:50] murderous now we get we can get angry
[39:52] with our words right angry with our
[39:54] thoughts but he gets around the wrong
[39:56] crowd
[39:58] number six is open
[40:00] denial uh it's John
[40:03] 18:18 no I'm sorry I wrote that WR down
[40:08] wrong no go to the next verse after that
[40:10] maybe it's 19 I might write down the
[40:11] wrong
[40:14] one okay oh wow they start talking about
[40:16] Doctrine hey that's what we'd be good at
[40:18] Hallelujah verse
[40:21] 20 okay now 21 I think I'm on the not on
[40:24] the right track here I wrot I didn't
[40:25] write down the right verse
[40:29] yeah here it is there it is thank you
[40:30] there it is hallelujah bless your heart
[40:32] and Simon Peter stood and warmed himself
[40:33] they said therefore to himart thou also
[40:34] one of the disciples he denied it and
[40:36] said I am not now here's what Malachi
[40:39] found from Scofield scoffield said Peter
[40:41] was sleeping while his master was
[40:44] praying think about that his master
[40:46] needed prayer and he couldn't even pray
[40:48] for
[40:50] him Church like I've told you if you
[40:52] don't have strength enough to pray long
[40:53] prayer just bow your head real simply in
[40:55] your car or just bow your head before
[40:57] you go to bed just say a simple prayer
[40:58] one minute of prayer would be better
[41:00] than no prayer
[41:02] Hallelujah God can hear that I've seen
[41:04] like I told you I've seen God answered
[41:05] my prayer is just driving home when I
[41:07] barely got strength to drive home I'm
[41:08] tired I'm exhausted I just pray in the
[41:10] car driving for that person and then I
[41:12] hear back later God answered the
[41:15] prayer because if I don't pray in the
[41:17] car brother Austin I'm probably gonna
[41:19] forget right because life so Peter was
[41:22] sleeping while his master was praying he
[41:24] was resisting while his master was
[41:26] submitting see is Jesus was submitting
[41:28] to arrest and Peter's resisting that
[41:30] arrest cuz he remember he didn't believe
[41:31] the plan of God Peter's like oh you're
[41:34] never going to go die you're never he
[41:35] said get behind me
[41:37] Satan see that Peter was resisting the
[41:41] will of God oh God help us to just
[41:43] submit to the will of God third he foued
[41:46] a far off and he sat down amongst his
[41:52] enemies so now you're joining the
[41:54] anti-age group sitting with the anti-
[41:56] message people
[41:58] people oh my goodness look at this and
[42:01] then lastly church I like this scoffield
[42:03] said Peter denied his Lord he denied his
[42:06] faith and he denied the Brotherhood of
[42:11] Christ he said I am not he denied it
[42:14] next verse
[42:18] 26 one of the servants said did I not
[42:21] see thee in the garden with him verse
[42:23] 27 he denied it again and immediately
[42:26] the crew now other other uh B
[42:28] gospels say I don't even know Christ I
[42:30] don't even know
[42:32] him how could anyone get any lower than
[42:35] this and yet God wasn't done with him
[42:39] God was going to make Peter a hero
[42:41] hallelujah amen glory to God God's not
[42:45] done with us church I'll say like that
[42:46] God's not done with you and I
[42:49] hallelujah
[42:51] hallelujah God did so much more through
[42:55] Peter now I want to go back to First
[42:57] Timothy now I'm going to transition into
[42:59] be a
[43:01] hero the word lay a hold on eternal life
[43:04] 1 Timothy 6:12 fight the good fight of
[43:05] Faith lay hold on eternal life brother
[43:07] William it means to rescue from
[43:10] Peril to help or
[43:13] secure so when you fight the good fight
[43:15] of faith and you lay a hold on eternal
[43:18] life you've rescued
[43:20] something so we got to look at we have
[43:22] to look at our Christian Life like I'm
[43:24] going to go out and rescue people from
[43:26] hell
[43:28] and even myself the Bible says with your
[43:30] own uh with with the will I'm not
[43:32] talking about God's sovereignty now God
[43:34] God knew everybody who is saved I'm
[43:36] talking about in the Battle of your
[43:37] Freemore agency the Bible says save
[43:39] yourselves from that untour generation
[43:42] Hallelujah in other words in your Human
[43:44] Experience it's like you don't know all
[43:46] of God's sovereignty so you're just
[43:48] doing your best with your own freeor
[43:50] agency you're trying to be a hero you're
[43:52] trying to be saved yourself you're
[43:54] trying to save others Hallelujah that's
[43:55] the attitude we have to have fight the
[43:57] good fight of faith and be a hero for
[43:59] Christ Hallelujah lay a hold of eternal
[44:02] life it means take possession of it I'm
[44:05] going to go remember the Bible Jesus
[44:06] said the violent take the kingdom by
[44:08] force
[44:09] amen so there's there there there's a
[44:12] there's a perspective we have to have as
[44:13] Believers I'm going to go take that I'm
[44:15] going to have eternal life I'm going to
[44:17] make the Rapture amen hallelujah I'm
[44:20] going to go try to save that person I
[44:22] want to make a difference in their life
[44:23] Hallelujah I want to be a hero praise
[44:26] God
[44:27] I'm want to lay a hold of eternal
[44:30] life Hallelujah but it's going to be a
[44:34] fight right it's not going to be easy
[44:37] it's going to be a fight Hallelujah but
[44:40] that's what we must do we must lay a
[44:41] hole we must fight for eternal life
[44:45] Hallelujah and see a double-minded man
[44:47] is unstable in all his ways but the Holy
[44:49] Ghost solves the problem
[44:51] Hallelujah the the the day of Pentecost
[44:53] for Peter it solved all his problems
[44:55] Hallelujah now did you have little
[44:57] mistakes yes you know he separated
[44:58] himself from the Gentiles he had little
[45:00] mistakes like that but he got corrected
[45:02] Hallelujah I'll say like this he no
[45:04] longer denied his
[45:06] Lord to the point when they were going
[45:09] to kill him he said don't crucify me the
[45:10] right way turn me upside down I'm not
[45:13] worthy no wonder he said that amen I'm
[45:15] not worthy to die like my Lord
[45:18] hallelujah that's the kind of faith that
[45:19] he had now that he was born again praise
[45:22] God he said I I can't die like my Lord
[45:25] I'm not worthy to die like him so put me
[45:27] upside
[45:29] down that's the kind of character that
[45:31] was the change in Peter's life
[45:38] Hallelujah I want to show something here
[45:40] now let me uh I sure hope this
[45:50] works okay can you switch over when you
[45:52] get a
[45:53] chance now L you forgive me if I get
[45:55] this wrong I'll take a lesson afterwards
[45:57] okay not a Bible Lesson a literary
[46:02] lesson so in stories they have what's
[46:05] called character arcs the characters go
[46:07] through different changes right you know
[46:09] that Austin's nodded I didn't know this
[46:11] until recently but this is what I see
[46:14] Peter's rise and fall you know he
[46:16] started in in the very depths of being a
[46:18] fisherman no way out there's you're
[46:20] trapped in here it's a cast system your
[46:22] life will never be good to spiritually
[46:24] he became rich but then he go to a he
[46:27] went to his lowest fall denying even the
[46:30] Lord that saved him but what did God do
[46:33] God redeemed his
[46:34] story go God made him the spokesman on
[46:37] the day of Pentecost amen I baptized 17
[46:41] Austin you were there I thought I was
[46:42] going to die I was so tired he had 3,000
[46:44] baptized amen hallelujah the book of
[46:48] Acts amen was You by who the man who is
[46:51] as low as he could possibly go our God
[46:54] is a great Redeemer hallelujah amen he
[46:57] can stoop to the lowest depths in order
[46:59] to give us hope redeem us change our
[47:02] story
[47:04] hallelujah amen I love it praise
[47:08] God now church I I don't have this one
[47:10] up there but L I hope my story is a
[47:12] ragster riches story the rags of riches
[47:15] just goes like
[47:16] this right in other words I don't want
[47:19] to fall like Peter
[47:21] fell Hallelujah I don't want to deny the
[47:24] message I don't want to deny no people
[47:25] in the church I don't want to I I I know
[47:28] Jesus I want to just go from richers to
[47:31] more riches amen I want to go from glory
[47:33] to glory From Grace to Grace Hallelujah
[47:36] now that's not a very exciting story but
[47:38] it's still a story and as long as Jesus
[47:40] is writing our story that's all that
[47:42] matters
[47:44] Hallelujah as long as he redeems us and
[47:46] gives us the story that we need praise
[47:49] God I believe some of these message
[47:50] preachers that have fallen over the
[47:51] years this is what I hope this is what I
[47:53] I hope happens I'm talking about the
[47:55] ones that have done you know some
[47:57] disgrace this is what I hope happens by
[48:00] God's
[48:01] grace it's always been my prayer God
[48:03] keep me from this great
[48:06] fall
[48:09] right now some of you know Judas Judas
[48:12] would have been oh yeah so uh this is a
[48:14] rise Then Fall then so Peter's story is
[48:16] a rise Then Fall then rise story you see
[48:18] it all the time in movies and you
[48:20] shouldn't see it in movies sorry you
[48:22] don't see it in movies because you don't
[48:24] watch
[48:24] movies unless you watch Christian movies
[48:27] and then you limit those uh but then
[48:31] Judas is like this Judas started really
[48:32] low of course Jew you know in the Roman
[48:34] system he raised really high and then
[48:37] that's the rise and the fall see
[48:38] everybody has a different
[48:41] story I like that Chris Toler song I
[48:44] Will Rise when he calls my name no more
[48:46] sorrow no more pain I will rise On
[48:48] Eagle's Wings before my God and stand
[48:52] I'll rise Hallelujah but you see judas's
[48:54] story never Rose
[48:57] said all he had to do was go repent to
[48:58] Jesus but instead he ended his life like
[49:01] there was no hope for it Jesus is the
[49:04] very personification of Hope amen all he
[49:07] had to do is go back to Jesus and even
[49:09] in Peter's case Peter denied more than
[49:12] Judas did Peter as far as we know didn't
[49:14] even go back it's Jesus went looking for
[49:16] him
[49:18] Hallelujah and he said if you love me
[49:20] feed my sheep that's what I'm trying to
[49:22] do today I'm trying to feed somebody the
[49:23] word of God today how many enjoy the
[49:25] word of God today is it is it taste good
[49:27] amen it's a word and due season be a
[49:30] hero for Christ
[49:32] Hallelujah now I didn't have time but I
[49:34] wanted to get through I we we could show
[49:35] Solomon's Arc you know Solomon's would
[49:38] have been like uh he started high high
[49:41] down and then up at the end that's he
[49:43] had a real bad downfall and then maybe
[49:46] just had a little rising at the end he
[49:47] wrote Ecclesiastes that was his
[49:48] finishing story there it's all vanity
[49:51] fear God and keep his commands
[49:53] Hallelujah deep great great deep fall
[49:55] but he had a huge rise you know I say
[49:57] maybe he started here and there for a
[49:58] long time he had a little more of a Arc
[50:02] there now I want to get to this quote
[50:05] brother Ram uses the quote 20
[50:07] times uh be a hero now I'm going to go
[50:10] in reverse so can't read
[50:13] it brother William you be familiar with
[50:15] this brother random quotes Henry
[50:18] Wadsworth Longfellow we live next near
[50:20] to Wadsworth so I thought it was pretty
[50:22] inspiring not really brother random uses
[50:25] this brother William from 1952 all the
[50:29] way to a few months before he
[50:31] died there's times in the sermon
[50:33] brother's talking about usually at the
[50:35] end of the sermon he's just talking
[50:37] about not giving up he's talking about
[50:38] going through trials being resilient
[50:40] amen being perseverance hallelujah
[50:44] amen uh I'm going to show you some
[50:46] quotes just do something for God he
[50:49] says remember you have a story you're on
[50:53] Earth for a purpose amen
[50:57] and you want to bless as many people as
[50:58] you can bless
[51:00] Hallelujah you in other words you want
[51:01] to be a hero for as many people as you
[51:04] can
[51:05] Hallelujah not pull them down not
[51:07] destroy them not discourage them you
[51:09] want to encourage them amen as a hero
[51:13] Hallelujah right the hero comes along
[51:15] right when you need him the most right
[51:18] that's what we want to be we want to be
[51:20] a hero to
[51:22] somebody so brother bar he'll quote this
[51:25] at least well I should say maybe around
[51:27] 19 or but at least 20 times he says be a
[51:30] hero brother Henry wodsworth Longfellow
[51:33] was a very famous poet uh he was lived
[51:36] in the 1800s and then American schools
[51:39] think about this I wish this was true
[51:40] Patrick American schools learned his
[51:42] poems because he was a Christian
[51:44] man the Bible used to be the most
[51:47] important book it would have been the
[51:48] only book in the schools but then they
[51:50] started introducing these and and then
[51:52] Mary had a little lamb That was supposed
[51:54] to be off of Mary and Jesus now Jesus is
[51:57] not even in the story how do I know
[51:58] because I'm in the schools I try to
[52:00] bring him in there in the mornings
[52:01] before school try to bring Jesus in but
[52:05] brother Ram had this uh some of this
[52:07] poem memorized not all of it I I didn't
[52:09] find where he memorized the whole thing
[52:10] but let's just read through this I want
[52:12] you to hear what brother Ram says about
[52:14] it so this is called a Psalm of Life so
[52:19] a song of Life what the heart of the
[52:22] young man said to the psalmist so
[52:24] there's a young man and he's saying this
[52:26] to a songwriter here's what a young man
[52:28] would say tell me not in mournful
[52:31] numbers life is but an empty dream so
[52:34] don't tell me life's empty right don't
[52:35] tell me life is useless brother man
[52:37] quotes this for the soul is dead that
[52:39] Slumbers and things are not what they
[52:44] seemen right so we we don't want a dead
[52:46] Soul that's the Sinners right the

[1:09:58] purpose it's something that will change
[1:10:00] him when a man meets
[1:10:03] God a man can never be the same if he
[1:10:06] ever meets God face to face it will
[1:10:08] change him in spite of anything you can
[1:10:09] do about it a man can never be the same
[1:10:12] after he once meets God you know what
[1:10:14] his example is
[1:10:15] Noah but said Noah met God the Bible
[1:10:18] said nobody had Grace in those days
[1:10:20] except Noah had Grace because he was a

[1:12:20] a hero in The Strife
[1:12:26] Hallelujah so Church what will your
[1:12:29] story
[1:12:30] be
[1:12:33] hallelujah what what's your story arc
[1:12:35] going to be I think there are six arcs
[1:12:36] there's probably more than that but I
[1:12:37] found a blog post with six of them yeah
[1:12:39] kind of maybe I'll show them tonight for
[1:12:41] the second service I'm G to preach a
[1:12:43] communion sermon here tonight by God's
[1:12:46] grace but friends Saints be the hero of
[1:12:49] your story don't give up don't quit
[1:12:54] don't stay down
[1:12:55] get up and fight the good fight of Faith
[1:12:59] like Peter you could you here today you
[1:13:03] you cannot be any lower than Peter
[1:13:06] denying the faith Now Thompson Chain
[1:13:09] said he blasphemed but I don't even know
[1:13:12] I don't know if we go that far blasphemy
[1:13:14] means to speak evil to rail at God I
[1:13:17] don't think Peter railed at Jesus he
[1:13:18] just said I don't know
[1:13:21] him but we can see the progression right
[1:13:24] from Pride and the fall all the way down
[1:13:26] to denial I don't even know him I have
[1:13:29] no connection with the Messiah the
[1:13:31] Messiah the Lamb of
[1:13:35] God no matter where we find ourselves
[1:13:37] today God has a story and he's trying to
[1:13:40] write our story how many want to let him
[1:13:42] write the
[1:13:43] story the most awful mistakes church we
[1:13:45] can make even of denying the word
[1:13:47] denying this denying
[1:13:49] that and even like Peter's life physical
[1:13:52] murder right almost God still reaches
[1:13:55] out his hand and offers him just like
[1:13:58] gory just like on on the sea when he
[1:13:59] pulled him up not only did Jesus do it
[1:14:02] naturally he did it spiritually praise
[1:14:04] God you and I couldn't be any lower
[1:14:06] today than Peter who denied the very
[1:14:08] message that went to him he denied the
[1:14:11] very Revelation Oh Glory he denied the
[1:14:13] Revelation that Jesus said he already
[1:14:15] had and that proves once you got a
[1:14:17] revelation it can never be taken from
[1:14:19] you Hallelujah think about that he had
[1:14:21] the Revelation that Jesus was the
[1:14:22] Messiah he denied that but that was his
[1:14:25] true that wasn't his True Confession he
[1:14:27] later got it he later got it back
[1:14:29] because the Gates of Hell will never
[1:14:31] Prevail against Revelation amen that's
[1:14:34] what Jesus said what Martha and Mary
[1:14:36] received at his feet he said what what's
[1:14:38] been given to you it'll never be taken
[1:14:40] from you glory to God in other words
[1:14:43] Revelation is eternal because it's the
[1:14:45] Eternal Word of God it's the Holy Spirit
[1:14:47] that's Eternal writing his word upon the
[1:14:49] fleshly tables of your
[1:14:53] soul so but be the hero be the parent
[1:14:57] who raises children in godliness and
[1:14:59] doesn't make compromises that's right be
[1:15:02] a hero for your kids don't leave them
[1:15:04] like some of our parents left
[1:15:06] us
[1:15:08] hallelujah remember I told you that
[1:15:10] story my uncle my Grandpa died and I
[1:15:13] went up to my Uncle Junior he passed
[1:15:14] away last year but I said Uncle Junior
[1:15:16] got any advice for me as a young man and
[1:15:18] he starts crying he said you know why
[1:15:18] you asked me that I said no why did I
[1:15:20] ask you that I think I would know why I
[1:15:22] asked you that he said you know why you
[1:15:24] asked me that he said because your dad
[1:15:26] left you and you feel insecure I'm like
[1:15:29] yeah that's right I really do my dad was
[1:15:31] never I always felt insecure Mal told me
[1:15:33] he's always felt secure because I've
[1:15:34] always been
[1:15:35] there so God God bless you buddy now but
[1:15:39] but but my uncle said see and they said
[1:15:42] you know why God allowed your dad to
[1:15:44] leave you I said no he said so you
[1:15:46] wouldn't leave your
[1:15:49] children right and that's true I know
[1:15:52] what it feels like to be left so now as
[1:15:54] a Christian I I would never leave my
[1:15:57] children this man I'm like who's talking
[1:16:01] here is this God or what it was God it
[1:16:04] was definitely God but see that that's
[1:16:07] part of your story be the hero to some
[1:16:10] child Hallelujah like my fifth grade

[1:22:40] fine others are kind and you just find
[1:22:43] all different kinds of people in his
[1:22:46] kingdom look at St Peter and judging by
[1:22:48] St Andrew now I don't know where this
[1:22:50] says it in the Bible but he said Andrew
[1:22:51] is that prayer Warrior just stayed on
[1:22:53] his knees all the time see most of you
[1:22:56] will never come up here and take a
[1:22:57] sermon and preach but you know what you
[1:22:59] can do you can preach a sermon on your
[1:23:00] knees praise God you can get on your

[1:23:08] you can pray more than other people
[1:23:10] could pray that's brother man said
[1:23:12] that's what Andrew St Andrew did but he
[1:23:15] said Peter wasn't that way he was uh one
[1:23:18] of those fire brands that preach and so
[1:23:19] forth and then Paul was more scholarly
[1:23:22] like so Paul's there reading the
[1:23:25] books Paul spend more time at the
[1:23:28] table this down that down Peter's just
[1:23:30] you know he's just praying to preach to
[1:23:32] real Heart Andrew is there on his knees

[1:23:55] people so we have nine gifts of the holy
[1:23:57] spirit which ones are
[1:23:59] yours I always like to end with that one
[1:24:03] be a hero minister to others the
[1:24:05] greatest among you is the servant

[1:26:04] in that capacity but remember never
[1:26:06] neglect the people God's given
[1:26:09] you that's what Moses got in trouble
