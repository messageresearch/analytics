amen also want thank Pastor for opportunity to give me to stand for the purch of the blood to me is hard prise the Lord otherwise if it's not God for me I for the past Lord bless them I also thank you for your presence let's keep coming for the services of God the truth are praise the Lord where St I don't know but the days are the Lord so I would I would rather to be where the services of Praise the Lord in the services of God he has alwaysed messages I call them Lely mes for a bride prise the Lord so if we are the bride of Christ whatever his presence is there is a Lely message praise the Lord W let's open the word let's go to the Book of John St John 14 and verse St joh 1421 uh the Bible says at that day the Bible says John 1421 he that has my Commandments and keepeth them and he it is that loveth me and he he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him now let's notice Jesus is saying and will manifest myself to him praise the Lord who praise the Lord Judas said unto him notot Lord how is it that thou wi man EST thyself unto us and not unto the world praise the Lord he said Jesus answered unto them unto him that is Judas if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our AB with him praise the Lord the Lord add a blessing reading let's pray father Lord want thank you for this evening priv to be in the house of God who are we God the grace that is show unto us Lord we' come it has lead us all our ways to the church in your presence father come and speak to us in moments of weakness Lord give us the grace to be comforted anoint your word I don't know what is the expectation of your children but Lord come and speak to them Lord that at the end of the day the glory may come back to you Love You Lord we appreciate you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen may be seated praise God Jesus was told asked how will thou manifest yourself unto us and not to the world praise the Lord in other words how are you going to make it because these people they have sight they are going to see it how will you do it that you manifest yourself to us and they are not seeing because when some someone sees of course he has to understand he know is that right when I sayon I know praise the Lord like when I'm blind if I I I don't know I'm iise the Lord but if I have sight I will know so Judas was wondering Jesus how will it be that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not to the world because 21 Jesus himself started mentioning manifesting I will love will manest myself to him praise the Lord Judas asked how will that be because wherever you are mudes of people praise the Lord and they have and they will see that manifesting how will it be praise the Lord may the Lord give us bre to go through thison praise the Lord the Lord knows how he does things praise the Lord sometimes it's past our knowledge praise the Lord one example I can give Daniel never knew whether he will have life after there is that right but God planed that he there down am and he made sure the lions are too hry the Lord so sometimes the ways of God p man is understanding on the other hand we may even fight his the one person the mother of the parents of Samson they were fighting Samson saw a woman for marriage he saw a woman for marriage and then he forced them parents get her for me but then this woman was of a Philistine side raised to sometimes the parents were right according to the word the manest word of God was on another so what happened on when they said okay let's go on going God Madeon comes why God was trying to see is the strength of Samson grown praise the Lord and when it was grown they went there but when if your Bible readers that was the way of God for him to go there because God was looking for how to attack phis so the only way was to First bring her problem to Samson whereby somebody has to make his heart feel to kill them praise the Lord what I want to say that sometimes ways they our understand what helps us is if is if what helps us to know God ways the ways is manifested praise the Lord and the word manifesting means to show clear in the eyes sometimes in the mind sometimes in demonstrations or appear praise the Lord one another thing the fire fers who knew that they would become Fourth Man In Praise the Lord but praise the Lord made the three Hebrews to enter there the Lord unless the word was thoroughly manifested to them God can never forsake his children praise the Lord now these men in times of Jesus Jesus tells them he said verse 21 he who has my Commandments them praise the Lord and He it is that loves me praise the Lord now one thing is may God help us that we may not be disobedient to the manifested word praise the Lord otherwise there is no another way there's not way works unless manifested to Us Praise the Lord he has to manifest to us you may know him believe him and accept him make him inside over our hearts that so that he is the ruler of our life praise the Lord the only way to do it manifested praise the Lord now today people are looking for Jesus until I was listening to a song in pcal church that they song what does that mean that there's no one like Jesus right there's no God Like Jesus but now when you preach to them Jesus as if you preach to them Jesus as God you may find empty Des they bringing it right praise the lord it's he is manifested to us be like how how will you do it praise the Lord because man the way man is cre God gave him the ideas of things on how he can really of how he can discover many things praise the Lord praise the Lord but you see sometimes we take the wrong trend of discoveries praise the Lord and yet our Discovery our discoveries they all in the Bible is that right but sometimes we take a lot of time to do many other things which may not help the praise the Lord now Jesus how will you manifest praise the Lord how would you manifest yourself unto us and not to the world prise the lord and not to the world Amen what I want to do I want to tell you that Jesus will never come if you don't love him praise the Lord he will never come to man you don't love him praise the Lord amen amen he will never otherwise things will go wrong prise the Lord things will go wrong amen so one thing I want to do praise the Lord that is it so now Jesus said if you love me you will keep my Commandments now what are the Commandments of God and what is the word which is manifested so that we can pick the Commandments of God Amen now Jesus said if you love me you keep my Commandments but let me first bring the you know the bride and Christ praise the Lord the bride and Christ now in the beginning if you want to understand the bride of Christ first look at praise the first was given the word and it was manifested praise the Lord the tree was there praise the Lord what to do don't touch don't eat faed the word is manifested and she failed why one reason she was walking alone sometimes told her you have praise the Lord but now given the word with the word praise the Lord in other words where is the protector the Lord she was walking where was The Protector praise the Lord because Jesus said verse 23 if loves me if anyone loves me he will keep my words my father will love him come we will come if you have the word that is good but don't accept to walk amen if you walk alone there are so many reasonings there are so many things that can make you even doubt what you have H praise the Lord had the word when she met the eny she evened the word but the thing is where was the head praise the Lord where wasam in other words she was satisfied with what she has and forgot her protection was after after allam the word and did it well manifested it to Eve praise the Lord to us God is so gracious that he gave us the word through the prophet is that right when he gave us the word through the prophet what does he expect of us that you keep it praise the Lord and when you keep it he has to come if he doesn't come Never Walk Don't Walk is that right the firstam had the word and it to Eve being excited with the truth but I wish had held and they were walking with Adam devil have not praise the Lord but since he was alone what praise the Lord so therefore the first Eve the bright reason she had the word was walking around yet it was manifested here when it is manifested God has to come praise the Lord so come to us now we are the bride of Christ praise the lord we are the bride of Christ isn't it now brother says when Eve went away from the word she went away from her that's what the prophet says she went away from that means she went away from protection and when she went from protection enemy came the enemy came praise the Lord one day Jesus was in the wilderness alone the is that right is that right when Jesus was walking Al in the wilderness the Bible says Satan came so both parties both parties have to be one in the enemy praise Lord today sent us the word through the prophet and this word is meant connect us to the Jesus Christ so he wrote lovely letters us the prophet to bring to us sometimes we are so busy let me speak this but with the Lord sometimes young Brothers we do things out alone you write a lovely letter to a girl some girls are excited others they read it and they ignore okay they don't take their mind there praise the Lord you never know sometimes God s his letters to us but unfortunately the bride the bride sometimes tends to ignore them praise but Jesus said he will send the Comfort to remind us of those L letters of the things he spoken he will always remind us I love you my he calls youde he always remind us how does he remind us when someone has led School then provides somebody sick ands isn't that someone is dying in sin and God dies on the cross that praise the Lord but sometimes we we tend to Slumber but we forget the lovely letter of Christ even in that still there is another option the Holy Spirit has always reminded us How He Loves Us Praise the Lord so now as the Bri [Music] Christ the bridegroom has always desired to make us loved of him how by making us [Music] off from the worldly things that he doesn't like praise the Lord look at Esther eser es no one she would even be a queen yeah that is right after all she was not of the rest everyone was against that rest watch the grace of God through the wisdom of of mod told hide your identity that's why she was given a name of Esther these are Babylonians but is Hebrew name and that was the name of Esther if she had presented that name before the king before the chamin I think she would not even see the king because those pares they were but she hide the ID and the name means beauty is hidden Lord praise the Lord so es who represents the bride sometimes we may look funny before the world and the truth we look F because the word cut of anything that is to God you know some kind of these trousers praise the Lord people this is the trend praise the Lord others they make SCS or something and when they move on the street even though you're Prophet but I want to tell you this helps us that but now to those people now look at this dring like this human the of Shaving you are still old all those cuts them off you look funny the bridegroom that's the way he wants you to be praise the Lord one day when you are presented before Lord but to us when the word is given we tend to Slumber are the lovely letters of Christ so anyone who loves the bride keep his what praise the Lord now the word as I said manifest means Clear View something something that Isen praise the Lord but now how was it going to be different from the way the believer sees it and the world because it was meant to be different praise the Lord the bride is looking forward for the Rapture is that right but I want to tell you this the Rapture started do you believe that I want to say this quote I'm not speaking for myself the started in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says he [Music] opened he opened and took of his flesh I want to see that quote so don't forget the Rapture started the people were waiting for it it started the Lord have you seen it he opened Adam's s took part of his flesh which was Adam the message Christ is the mystery of God so that's what I'm saying the bride of Christ if we are waiting for the rupture it started praise the Lord it is on the truth is let God be gracious that he manifests it to us praise the Lord I want to say that quote to confirm what I'm saying so that is how God wants us to be is let us live by his word okay you trying another thing the message says and to be surea thata [Music] the whole Rapture now praise the Lord the prophet says and to be sure that the whole rupture now was a praise the Lord so when did it start you can help me to see here to be sure that the whole rupture praise the Lord was a was a prophets were a part if they were not praise the Lord just in Revelation that they was walking up they were making up the body maybe one was making the maybe the toes maybe the arms and so for until the head which we get in the few minutes that makes the entire rupt has it started I want to see the church has the started Ed the only way let God be merciful and to help us see this this one those people with motorcycles outside they don't see it no one will see it because started long ago where is it it's now started wle prophets praise the Lord so that's how it started but now God in his mind in his mind he had a mystery which he called a great mystery praise the Lord because in the firstam god opened the side and of the side on the side Eve came out even to us this is when I think I call it when it started because even on the cross Jesus was dying and when he gave the something came from the side water blood is that right he was forming the bride for himself and when he did that he sent lovely letters first APLE Paul started the forming of the another praise the Lord so the started long time amen now here he comes to us on our side he comes and he's giving us love praise the Lord some people say the seven Church praise the Lord is that right God God is moving is that right until we are gone because walked with God he was not let us not in seven church is moving the head praise the Lord The Head and the body they have toite and the two they are of one otherwise wouldn't have called Eve Flesh of My Flesh if she was picked from an elephant praise the Lord but Flesh of My Flesh why God made him life and removed from his even us to be the bride of Christ to make sure that we are out of his without such he can't manifest to anybody like that and when is doing the Manifest you who is not part it will be different you think life is going on the other hand when God is giving a bride to a man sometimes if that man is so pray he always me Theif of that man praise the Lord but if it's not prayed up I don't have words there Lord but a man who prayed God will give you your kind so to us to be of Christ we have to be from his Source from his side the bright praise the Lord the prophet says God promised in the last days that he would manifest and would vindicate his word to her that is I mean that's the bride praise the Lord God promised he's going to reveal manifest and V his word to her and still she wouldn't do it the bride now praise the Lord all that God promised her by his servants the prophets praise the Lord but the truth is promised to vindicate and he will make it sure you see it realize he put all possible ways to see it The Virgins are there but the pure bride must walk with the manifested word of God that manifested word of God isone but himself so when you were walking alone remember the first praise the Lord but when you're working with the manifested word which is Christ himself he went to and went away from the world because he was walking with him praise the Lord but when we walk alone what the devil join the charot the devil joins the he will make me a foolish who has the word the manifesting of but now the prophet says God promised toate in the last days his word praise the Lord now the prophet still says but the God is but God is great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus praise the Lord then given right down to his church what once in God's mind is now in the body of the of Christ Jesus and what is he doing prop says he is making his love to the church praise the Lord his bright Whispering secret to her praise the Lord this is what the prophet is saying nowy he is revealing and I mean he's making his love to the church that's why he said a manes me keep my words when he has kept my words just make love with him praise the Lord walk with him walk with I mean Christ is walking with him the church the bride after he's walking he's not telling louder secrets but he is Whispering the neighbor not right sometimes sorry for the young ones sometimes the married people I'm talking to the ones who are in love who don't have shadows in their Liv that marriage Paul said our marriage they reflect Christ and the church sometimes I don't know people in my house always been hearing I don't know whether people in my house have been hearing sometimes IIs to my even the neighbors know and we have them many so even Christ he's making love with the church and the church has accepted him as his bridegroom talking with him then he whisp secrets to her and one of the secrets one day go home one day day shall be away from this evil just like as men go men they don't wish bad to their wives then what about Christ what about Christ sometimes Sur this is this is so abnormal that the bride of Christ is so comfortable on the earth until some people say there's heaven on Earth that heaven on Earth that means they have made their homes so nice it is like heaven almost but they don't know Heaven because heaven is much than I can't explain what ising praise the Lord if men wish good to their loved ones Christ to his bride praise the Lord because he will take us to a wedding I want to you mares even though somebody doesn't have money make ising he wants the bright to eat well but what about Christ prise the Lord to his bride some of us we have never G to space but our hon the where it will be I can't tell but I think it's very nice how I wish to be there prise the Lord so Christ is making his love us and we accept that he's going to whisper so Judas who is here how will he manifest himself to me or to you not to the world one way if you love him and you keep his Commandments then he has to come and make love to to you and he has made that love to you there must be whispering of secet Praise the Lord and some of these secrets his coming the Lord and we have to know we going to be ignorant praise the Lord because everything is open the are finished but let's search them honestly and asking God his favor show us his but the Bible says you have to first love him because for him he led you then you have to love him back and then while you love him there must be aing abing no AB is AB with you there must be fellowship or something like and then while you in love with him he's giving you lovely letters take them sometimes we think God doesn't see because he can't act immediately so we think he's not seeing or something like that but many people of the earth if somebody gives you his treasure and you take it right that man will be offended praise the Lord so if God gives us his best take it negligently like praise the Lord what do you expect of him prise the Lord to other people could open and others the she could come and eaten and others so many things were done to them like the like the David and gise the Lord was taken off because he was defying the army of God so God is being gracious to us he has given us his word which we must walk with we must keep which we must okay which has to give us Direction Where to go praise the Lord so the prophet says now the Christ in the church is being made known prise the the Christ in the church is being known the whole thing is the ration of God the whole thing is of the revelation of God is to take Eve back to her right position praise the Lord the whole thing God wants to take us back our orinal positions where we had Dominion everything praise the Lord praise the Lord so he says again with her husband to take back to take Eve back to her right position again her husband praise the Lord notice and God is the husband of the church and the church is the bride of Christ praise the Lord so the prophet says calm down go Christ is in the church praise the Lord this what the prophet is saying Christ is in the church but I want to assure you some people don't know him they don't know him he is in the church in other words the word is is present not past nor future but he is in the church let me add one word right now he is in the church just being made praise the Lord and then the prophet says the whole thing is the reation of God take Eve back to her now what is it who is this Christ the prophet says in the message there is a man here that can turn on the right says what is it the V what is Jesus today to he's making himself known they manifesting him that manifested Jesus word is Jesus to how many people are looking for Jesus the prophet says the man the vated word is Jesus to praise the Lord so how will you manifest yourself to us and not to the world here is the first view is the world concerned no are we concerned if yes he's making man Lord keeping his word will entitle us to more secrets because when we have him what then take the whole world but give me Jesus praise the Lord but some of us we love the world so much and yet in there nothing praise the Lord people tell me what about water that is for my help to sustain this body other if I would not take it then God would not put it there if I was not to take it then God would not bring it praise the Lord so it is there for me me through the Journey so I can't hold on it after ofure still die others think in this world there is O I know it Lord but take the whole world give me the Fountain of Life praise the Lord because sometimes I don't know people oy peopley people oygen but the doctors treating them the doctors who are working on them but which so may God help us that we may walk with the manifested word of Christ which the prophet said word the is Jesus today praise the Lord in other words the first if today if you walk without the manifested word allow me to say walking and where are you going the how long will you walk after allus said our said without him we can do nothing so why do we enjoy walking around the Lord therefore God said if anyone loves me he will keep my word and we will come to him and make our AB praise the lord we will make our praise the Lord and where Jesus is the s writer says when Jesus come that temp power BR praise the Lord I wish Eve walked with the temp Powers be broken if we walk with Jesus the temp power will be broken and therefore we shall make his interest on us until he wants to be with us praise the Lord like on the other side the word manifested brought some issue of reaction praise the Lord to sister when the word like the prophet was telling how God word was manif spoke and things happen that is true was you know she got into the anointing and when she got into then the the prophet says then the Holy Spirit came and told her told him give her what she wants what was the first thing keep the word praise the Lord when she kept the word and it then the Holy Spirit came and when the ho Spirit came didn't he provide whated is that so different to us no prise the it's not God is always present just don't even call him even calling him Jesus Christ is in the church so don't bother calling him what you do keep his word when you keep his word he can't stay where his word is not if he know someone is feeding on his word somebody's testimon is you know making life of people to be baptized and repent to repentance to be there how I wish God loves to be here praise the Lord so if he loves be here let's fellowship with him keep him without him we are nothing praise the Lord wow I want to read one more quote praise the Lord the moment we walk with Christ there are so many things that he will lead us off to Perfection praise the Lord now the prophet [Music] says he is the principal theme of the Bible is the principal theme of The Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it is a historical book A book of love it is a book of songs it is a book of life the how I wish we enjoy the songs of the brid praise the Lord another thing and in there you find Christ praise the Lord whom we are waiting for is the principal theme of The Bible praise the Lord and he says he was in the Psalms he was in history he and he also the Bible he also in the Bible he is I mean is the things that is to come so he was before until after what does he make him then the same yesterday today and forever and you inject something in there that doesn't make him the same yes done forever where do you go you got an awful picture there so he was the history he is the prophet he is the P he is everything if you can't make him praise the Lord if you can't make him praise the Lord the prophet says and if you can't make him everything and the same where what is your picture look like praise the Lord because he is the same thing he's the same thing he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them and he was in Psalms he was in the history and he is the thing to come praise the Lord would be the Principal theme he should be the Principal theme he should be the Principal theme what if that is what he is and we believe it don't we then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking you know the principal theme in other words he must be the one we speak of praise the Lord he must be the one that we talk of and when you talk of him he has to come so he has to be the Principal them of our talking thinking singing of our walks I mean our singing our walks he should be the principle them of our life us then he should be the principle them of everything that we do all think should be Christ the lord it should be Christ amen so brothers and sisters for God to man himself to us he has to be the princip of everything that we do talking have to talk him sometimes you hear people who are in first love you know courtship and things like that talking talk about each other I know they feel good you make a mistake of cut Communication in such moments you see reaction I thought he loved me he can't even receive my then what about bless as our brother comes up that song which says I can hear my savior is calling where he leads me truly I follow brother Moses I can hear my saor call I can hear my savior call I can hear my saor calling take thy cross for the fall of me oh where he Liv me I will [Music] follow where he leads me I will follow where he leades me I will fall I go with with him with him all the way where he leads me where he leads me I will follow where he is me I will will follow where he is me I will follow I go with my Lord with with him all the way where he leads me where where he Le me I will [Music] fall where he leades me I will follow where he Liv may I will fall [Music] L I
