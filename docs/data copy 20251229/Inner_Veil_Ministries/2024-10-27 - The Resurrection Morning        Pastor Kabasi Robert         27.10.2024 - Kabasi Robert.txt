and servants in this place oh my father Lord Jesus I pray you speak to us I get out of the way that you may have your perfect way in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so I just want to invite you to the word of God Amen the book of St Mark verse 1 up verse says when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salom had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the SE at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall Roar us away the Stone from the door of the spalle and when they looked they saw that the stone was roded away for it was very great and and entering into the SE they saw a young man sitting on the right side clo long white garment and they were Afra and he said unto them be not afraid you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him may God bless theing of his word we may get seated so it's a great morning I trust that the Lord really has been very gracious to to you and I'll just come to give a few compliments Amen on Friday back home I was talking about motherhood and I say that the mothers always uh really speak a lot of what the children are going to be and they give prophetically of what the child is going to be uh similar the churches where we are born they speak a lot of what we are going to be they prophesy and as the word is going forth It's a prophecy it catches you and ites you like the way the mother the Hebrew mothers when they were going through pain they would cry and cry but every time when they cried and called the name of that child that put the child exactly where that child was supposed to be and the preaching of the word in a local church always places us exactly where we are supposed is that amen and I appreciate God that if there's anything I'm going to preach it's what I was mothered to preach amen so Pastor not run away from what I'm going to pre not run away amen because a child will always be what the mother is I'm talking about the resurrection morning amen you know we see that on that day when they had gone through a lot of groom a lot of rejection and the church was scattered what could only bring the church together was a resurrection amen because everything had failed but there was only one prophecy which had remained and that was the prophecy of the Resurrection amen but when it came the people never knew it not understand but it it was the day they were still in the groom they were still in sadness they wanted to anoint the dead they want to associate themselves with Jesus as a dead person but Jesus wanted for them to be associated with him in the resurrection amen so the lord gave me a subject I've been really battling and wondering what am I going to speak on such a subject the resurrection morning what a day that it was what a time that it was that amen that you know when Jesus had turned the whole universe what it had never seen a new generation or a new era all together amen people had died great people had died and they had been mourned the world would gather but nobody had ever risen up amen no one had even never made a claim that I can put down my life it up again it was only one man who did it who spoke it and fulfilled it and that was Jesus Christ is that amen the prophet tells us of all the religions of the world there is only one religion which has got a living follower is that amen that's Christianity the Buddhists they are very good in the psychology the Muslims they can always point you to the grave and every every child every denomination they have got a grave where their follower where their Master is we have got an empty grave am it was proved on the resurrection morning when when the angel said come inside here don't even just stand out there they were saying who will run away the the stone when they reached the stone was already roll away is that amen they were wondering how are they going to anoint him but when they reached he was not there the grave was already empty is that amen it changed their conception and Christianity is based on Resurrection amen the prophet says says if God made a way for a flower to live again how much more he did for a man to live again the whole basis of Christianity is based upon the fundamental fact of Resurrection amen says now if I should drop this on the floor now to pick up this off the floor would not would not be not be a resurrection or or pick up something that looks like it it wouldn't be a resurrection Resurrection is pick up the same thing that dropped down amen you know if I if I throw a paper here and then I pick something else that is not a resurrection sometimes we always say locally that you know when somebody dies and then the children produce another person they said the other one has resurrected no that's not a resurrection is that amen that's another person all together a resurrection would be that very person who went into the ground coming up again that's what we call a resurrection is amen and Jesus Christ in Romans 81 we are told that the same spirit that raise up Jesus Christ from the dead that spirit dwelleth to us that same spirit will Quicken our mot bodies that amen it will resurrect us it will change these bodies from corruption incorruption fromal immortality That's the basis of Christianity is that amen if there is no Resurrection we are like any other denomination is that amen if there is no Resurrection we are like the Buddha we are like the Muslims we are like every like all the tradition is they also teach good discipline is that amen some of them are much better than the Christians the greatest thing with Christianity is a resurrection amen it's a change of our body some religion is teaching that when you die you'll come back but you may come back like maybe an old amen you may come back like a CL and they may see certain animal moving on the ver and they say so and so is moving out not like that Resurrection is talking about you as the Lord has made you to rise up again to pick up that body and come back again is that amen it's not coming back as an angel we are not going to come back as angels we are going to come back according to Resurrection the very way we are is that amen we shall pick up these bodies do you love the Lord Resurrection is not picking up is not picking up something else it's not coming back maybe like as if you a star you not come back as a St no when we resurrected we come back the very way that God meant us to be so when they went in the morning they saw an angel Jesus was not an angel is that amen he said he is not here he's already Ren is that amen when we when we come to Christianity we take long anointing the dead it take a long time anointing the dead is that amen we anoint the body we take care of the body but we must look at rection because the time come when this body must be able to be changed and Resurrection speaks of change amen it speaks of what you would call maybe genal engineer or something like that amen it changes this body from time to immortality amen it changes this weakness into strength it changes all the weaknesses of the body and gives us another form all together amen so if the spirit that was in Jesus Christ inside of us the same way Jesus rose up the same we shall rise up again is that amen there is going to be a Resurrection morning sometimes we worry sometimes we fear sometimes we cry and we say this all that man was meant to be is that amen because after solving one problem another one is coming is that amen after resting in the night there's another day which is coming after eating today there is another that you want food after paying school fees before you know you have got to pay school fees again after buying a new cloth before you know you need another one it looks like a constant cycle of suffering a constant cycle of things that cannot stand the test of time but the resurrection does not only speak about gaining back our body it speaks about a changed body amen the prophet says the greatest event that has ever happened in the world is the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ amen of all the things that have happened the resurrection of Jesus Christ was the greatest thing that ever happened and the greatest that we are waiting for is the resurrection of our bodies amen it's going to be a wonderful day it's going to be a precious day together when all the sa of long ago all the Beloved ones that we have walked with that we have sat with that have been covered down when they overcome that devil Called Death is that amen when they rise up again it's going to be a wonderful morning amen and we know that it's going to be a morning is that amen because Resurrection takes place in the morning amen when we sleep we rise up in the morning when Jesus Christ rose up the says very early in the morning amen we shall rise up like the Morning Star is that amen and we shall shine again in the brightness because morning speaks of strength amen every time you rise up in the morning we must rise up new death of the night all night speaks of death is that amen when we come to the night we Le down we take on the image of death is that amen we areed we are so weak is that amen but the Bible is telling us is the spirit that raise up Jesus Christ the spirit dwelleth into you church are we together like when we go to sleep there are people who never rise up why the spirit is not there if the spirit is there you may sleep spirit will Quicken you in the morning amen will tell you rise up it's a time to work the same thing if the spirit of Jesus Christ D inside of you the same way that Spirit R up Jesus Christ in the same way it will come and Quicken our bodies is that amen amen we may cry in the night we may we may grown in the night when the morning comes it brings a sunrise it brings a change and the angel will always point us to a living Jesus is that amen the messenger always point us to a living Jesus why are you looking for the living among us the dead he's not there is that amen we have heard but there is a resurrection morning when the angel of the Lord has got to come and wak us up arise is that amen get out of sleep amen so we know that in that Resurrection morning Mary was so sorrowful and the rest of the disciples they were so sorrowful they were crying some of them they were running away some were hiding some were just you know moving on the way talking amen but to each of them the greatest news was he is Reis he is reison and know their hopes were gathered together all their frustrations were gathered together he meets Mary just go and tell my disciples even Peter that I am alive and I will meet you is that amen and as we are walking on the way and they were frustrated where have they taken him everybody is saying he not here but when they were moving on the way what happens he comes amen and is's walking with them but they couldn't understand why for them they were taken with grief they were taken with a lot of sorrow and that's what always blackens our Resurrection morning is that amen it's the Tres that we have gone through it's the cha that we have gone through then we forget the word of God but the holy spirit always come and Quicken us to the reality is not dead amen and if he is not dead and we have got the same Spirit we shall rise up again amen know when he spoke to them about the resurrection he took them back to the Genesis brought them all through the scriptures walked with them talked with them and then he reaches a time he began speak of the present amen and the Bible says then you open their eyes and when their eyes were open they realized him amen and then they begin to say our heart bur within us as he walked with us spoke with us our hearts within us when we hear the gospel sometimes looks ordinary what is that burning in your soul amen is the resurrected Jesus speaking unto you amen it's not a dead Jesus it's a living Jesus every time he speaks unto you our hearts burn within us that enough to make us know that he is alive amen praise be to God the very beautiful and most beautiful morning was the resurrection amen all the saints of old they were promised to this they had a lot of blessings in the world you look at Abraham he had riches he had you know he had he had he had good life he had popularity he had all that God would give him the greatest thing when this life was over was for him to know that there is a resurrection is that amen and all of them when it came to the time of death God helped them to look beyond the B what we call looking past the C of time and when they looked they told their children me in can is that amen me in can and Abraham bought a portion they they had to BU all his people that's where his wife sah wased that's where he was bued that's where all the prophets amen they were said in can what were they looking at they were looking on the resurrection amen for them they were shown what Mary so that for them they were sh what that they were far back in Genesis 258 uh the Bible says talking about Abraham we can just speak a few things amen 8 Genesis 25 gen 25 vers 8 it says then Abraham gave up The Ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was GED his people and his sons ISAC and ish bured him in the cave of M in the field of Ephron the son of Zora the HTE which is before m the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of there was Abraham and Sarah his wife 29 it says and the true and the time Drew nigh that Israel must die and he called his son Joseph and said unto him if now I have found Grace in thy sight put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me Bury Me Not I pray thee in Egypt the man is dying but if you look at what job was saying there's no knowledge in death there's nothing good about death but he's telling his son have found grace before you the only hope that I have don't bu me here don't bu me in Egypt can I pray why because you there going to come a certain morning when the sense of God are going to rise up and Resurrection was in the promised land amen verse says but I will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their buring place and he said I'll do amen there was a place there was something that they knew about that barri amen you can be buried anywhere it's okay but here is talking about a resurrection why is talking unto Joseph say we have eaten we Dr everything is okay don't bu what does Egypt mean don't bur me in the world said amen let my bones in the promised land why because in there when the trumpet of God shall sound in Christ Jesus rise up again the place physically speaking the first resurrection are we together it took place in that very area where they were amen MTH 27 tells us 2 27 tells us about this Resurrection verse it says MTH 27:50 okay says Jesus when he had cried again with voice up the and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twine from the top to the bottom and the Earth did quick and the Rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept Aros and came out out of the out of the graves after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared to many is that amen so when these people were going away God was able to show them is that amen that if you want a resurrection you must be in a certain place amen and as Christians our Resurrection the Bible tells us we must be in Christ Jesus amen and every Christian never in your life whatever happens ever live this world without knowing about your Resurrection is that amen you must Ure make aen make an agreement with the Lord Jesus amen I must die in you why that's where the resurrection is is that amen everything that God gives us speaks about that Resurrection amen healing healing amen is an Evidence of Resurrection God gives us the things this body it can become so weak always fallen sick and when I fall sick always wonder how can the body rise up again from this it becomes so weak your hand becom so heavy your head becomes so heav everything becomes so complicated but God when he comes and heals you again and you forget about the pain what is speaking about about a change speaking about the power of God take away the pain that amen and the prophet says if there is no Divine Healing there is no Resurrection is that amen because if we fall sick we are ready to go and go but when he gives us back our heal gives us back our strength it's the same way amen that these weak bodies they shall be picked up again and they shall live again is that amen the healing of our bodies is an Evidence of Resurrection is that amen because it's so complicated sometimes we get broken amen when God comes and bus the body he says sign of Resurrection when we sleep and we are totally helpless and you don't know what is going on you are so silenced however powerful you are when you rise up again in the morning speaking about a resurrection amen sometimes we get so sorrowful until our hearts are breaking until you can't hold tears until you can't stand but when God comes down and heals your body and heals your soul and heals your heart and you can laugh again and you can walk again it's a sign of a resurrection but all the things that are here shall be changed is that amen are we together sometimes it looks like all this cannot go away any time how will this ever if God can heal your heart and heal your soul and change you then it's a sign that there is a resurrection is that amen if you remember those people God healed in the Bible many of them somewh in very terrible situation they had given up with them amen let's take an example of Lazarus he had a Min Resurrection is that amen that one was just was just an Evidence of the Resurrection I'm talking about is that amen because there that Resurrection where by the dead are given back their life but they are not changed is that amen but they raised up but they are not changed but that's an Evidence amen of the real great morning of Resurrection God can be able to raise you and bring you back into this body he is able to raise you into a glorious body is that amen Christians how greatest hope is that is that amen these bodies as they become weak know you grow begin to weaken the prop says around 22 23 you begin to come to the afternoon of your life is that amen death begins to Mark you amen it's marking you one step at a time it will begin to Mark you amen it will Mar you with a little rink on the face but it's coming against you it will you with a gray hair coming against you it will you with the shoulders getting you know stoed bying against you it will bend your back amen scanning against you together but the greatest thing that was ever given to is a resurrection a change of this body it will go back to the original and why do we live why do we live we want a good Doctrine that's okay but have we ever thought about the resurrection is that amen after all the good Doctrine is over after all the blessings Miracles and wonders the Christian is able to look at the resurrection amen like the way looked he looked for food like any other person Jacob looked for blessings we look for them is that amen he had to steal them where it meant he had to go and work and heed he looked for food like the way we do at the end of The Journey he tells his son Sarto me that you not bu me in egpt whatever it is swear that you will not die in the world but you not lose your life Egypt egpt has fed you Egypt has cared for you but you should not be buried in Egypt change your buing place change your destiny amen from the world the school has nurtured you said amen culture has helped you but not be in culture do not be bured in education do not be bured in politics do not be bured in riches you must be buried in him who is the resurrection is that amen because he told M I am the resurrection when he came Lazarus amen when Lazarus was dead mother said if you had been here my brother would not have and mother said and Jesus said your brother again been in her church she already said I know he will rise up again when at the resurrection morning but Jesus said I am the resurrection was it the future was now in the present the resurrection you are looking at already started and how does it start he said where have you bued said amen where have you bued him and they took him to the Grave they said it is already stinking he said no something has got to be done if you believe that Lazarus will rise up in the resurrection then you must believe today that amen that the same God is not in the future he is in the present if you believe that you rise up again you must believe for the healing of your body is that amen which is greater which is greater is in the resurrection of the body and the healing of your body the resurrection is so complicated is amen but if you believe in the resurrection You Must Believe in the healing of your body amen because he that resur the who he us yes thank you for believing now I'm preaching about the resurrection but will you believe today about Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever that that is going to raise you up is the same one who is able to change your condition take away the stone that R theone Stone of unel show me where is he buried because if he the same God who you believe is God rise up your brother the same God going to heal your brother is that amen he's the same yester for if he going to take away Sorrows going take away all the grief take away all the things of the falling and is the same God everything that's happening today is a shadow of the Resurrection is that amen you've got somebody who has backing your child or whatever and you are praying God I want my children to be in the resurrection I want my brother to be in the resurrection I want my mother to be in the resurrection you can pray for them for that Resurrection I am I am the resurrection comes in the present confirm what is going to happen in the amen where have you buried him sometimes we say the stone is too big amen where have you put him you are dealing with him that that that is the mass of all the impossibility amen the prophet says says give me that plain gospel in Simplicity that will make me believe the resurrection is that amen the simple Gospel of believing the word of God is what we need is that amen sometimes we are complicating things the resurrection is not is not an act of psychology that of theology knowing a lot it's not even an act of having a lot of these things and whatever believe that he that you have believed is that amen if situations have changed go and tell Peter go and tell my disciples even alive [Applause] said amen I'm going to handle this situation because there's something greater if I've been able to lay down my life I'm more than able to raise you up do you love the Lord amen so the Bible tells us for those that are in Christ Jesus will God bring with him is that amen is where you are are you in Christ Jesus are you rooted inside there that's where we must stand amen and the greatest crown that was given to the ministry of Jesus Christ was a resurrection is that amen if he had preached people and done everything and he never rose up again that was the greatest flow but the greatest Crown he had Amen in Revelations 118 I am he I am he but was dead and I am now alive amen I am not only alive but I have got the keys of hell and the grave I am more than able open for you he has got the keys the keys of death is that amen if he didn't rise up again we would be one of the miserable People First Corinthians 1512 let see what Paul says about it First Corinthians 152 says now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the Dead is that amen the person you are believing the person you are been baptized into they are saying he rose up then why do some people say no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of of the dead then is Christ not Ren and if CHR be not reason then is our preaching Vain and your faith is also vain this why it should be emphasized our preaching will be vain also your faith is vain if Christ really the one we talk about heed 5000 he just you know walked on the water he just did Miracles and he never rose up again do you see it should be emphasized he rose up and if you Rose up I'm preaching now has got hope and your faith has got something solid is that amen understand that amen you may say I may not understand it because Christ Rose I Rise up again I not preach the doct maybe very well but because he reason you love the Lord yeah and we are wi of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be the dead rise not amen for if the dead rise not then is not Christ reisen and if Christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins amen yeah the very evidence of his resurrection the very real understanding that he rose up again and that's the person that you are trusting that the will up is that amen we who are still living here you know we we we are going to partake of the Rapture amen we shall be changed in a moment but I want to tell you the greatest thing is a resurrection because all the saints of The Seven Ages amen those that are sleeping they are more the saints that are living today is that amen so the rure the change of the body will be for very few people the resurrection is for the greatest number is that amen yes because it's pertaining only to the seven Church age and only to a small portion Resurrection discovering all the s that we are preached to by by them that came in the second age the fourthe Thee the 6 age they are all waiting and not only those even those in the 7 age that have rested they are also waiting and now what a date is going to be when the resurrection morning comes for the is that amen we see Paul we see not only those people but all the that were with them what going to be when we see our loved ones that have gone before us in this generation a resurrection morning is a wonderful morning is that amen it's the most glorious be assured that there is a resurrection amen and the Bible says unless those people rise up we shall not also be changed yes the Bible says the trumpet of God shall sound and them that have died in Christ shall raise up then we which are living shall be changed is that amen so that Resurrection it has got a Rapture inside of it amen of the de you love the Lord It's a change of the body it's a wonderful thing let's take the gospel serious amen because as we live here the only thing that we can hold on of all things is a resurrection if there's no Resurrection our faith is in is that amen the Lord 14 verse he a question job 141 that is born over woman few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fle also as a shadow and continueth not amen and open th eye upon such as an one and bringeth me to judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one see his days are determined the number of his month are with thee thou Hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass amen his gring gr suffering he was asking if verse go to verse S for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease amen he's looking at other things they have a resurrection the trees have a resurrection he finds them spreading up again when the winter comes when they are cut down there's a resurrection is they coming about the flowers he them rising up again but with M he said they just bu him his children come and they cry and they go he are saying what is the end of man is that amen and when you go in detail the prophet tells us he was one of the richest men of the earth he was one of the wisest men of the he had everything that you talk about then he realiz that man even if he's given 100 years he says he born over a woman has few days is that amen he comes up like a flower and then with happens to that is that amen he gets old he gets weak you know he loses interest everything becomes useless what's the end of man he was puzzled amen but in chapter verse 2 the Lord comes down to give him a perfect revelation he says for I know that my redeem that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth what was that he was seeing that Resurrection I know he didn't he [Music] for e e what a revelation of the Resurrection is where you can stand before the and say Satan what do you want with me where are you going to take me you a loser you have no power amen and when he realizes that you that Revelation even sickness cannot stand even fear cannot stand even worries cannot stand every question is already why you have got a revelation of your end is that amen when you are not guessing around and you know I will rise up is that amen I will rise up in the resurrection morning I will be one of them that will walk on the streets I will be one of them that will shout hallelujah one of them that will W to the Lord in the resurrection morning when the saints are singing as they Maring in when the saints are going I will be one of themen the Resurrection morning that's where the Christians must be is that amen we can speak situations that oppress Us by speaking about the resurrection Satan will not just say you are thinking about Resurrection now I he will not because he knows and they that know they God they shall do great exploits amen so all the questions were answered and he started to rejoice when he spoke that what happen the heaven started to R down blessings situation started to give away is that amen I don't think he was just okay no things were hard but that revelation of speaking to Satan and the Brethren that were around I know where I am standing I know my redem I know I have believed and I Amed Upon Us amen the Lord Jesus Christ the disciples came to him how thees came to him and they asked him show us a sign to prove you are the great the great one we are waiting show us a sign show us a sign he turned unto them he said an evil a wicked and generation after but there is no sign going to be given unto you apart from the sign of Jonah is that amen the greatest sign that God gives to the generation that Wicked is a sign of Resurrection he says as Jonah was in the womb of the Earth or was in the womb of the whale for three days and three nights so shall the son of man be in the in in the grave but yet he shall rise up what was the of the Jews of the phes is a sign of Resurrection that's what God gives us healing they have seen they all claim which do which doctors they claim they claim Divine Healing the Muslims they claim Divine Healing the Catholics they claim Divine Healing come speaking Tong they do that come to Miracles is that amen they talk about this and that to comfort them so show us a sign what sign could you Jesus show them there is no any other sign going to be shown from the of what was Jonah's say a sign of death burial and Resurrection again amen somebody can be shut up the world can swallow him but yet because he's alive that's the greatest sign if you are in a squeeze the way job was the sign that God gives us a sign of Jonah if you in a squeeze in the M the wom of of a whale the world is squeezing you what do amen tells us Prophet tells us he turned he went back to the scriptures and he said when he said when Solomon was dedicating the temple he said whoever will pray and look this Temple with you here so while he was in the womb while he was in the Dark Hour what did he do he turned his eyes where through the temple of God and the word of God and what happened the world had to vomit him a man who doesn't give up when situation is ahe the devil will eventually give up with a man who is in squeeing but is still calling upon the name of the Lord a man who has got a little breath to whisper can say have upon me I know I am canot take him in in the situation the circumstances will let lose I show you a sign sign of Jonah he never gave up he was the righteous man but he went back to the scriptures because there is a resurrection we can't go go and go and go forever you can't backslide back sliding back sliding and you a child of God and you can't rise up and cry God there is a resurrection I don't know what situ you might have gone through that cannot hear you if you turn him of jold is given unto us amen you may be so deep in the womb of sin circumstances of situations but you can rise up again you can rise up again amen so what do we do we set all our affections is that amen let's turn our Compass when we are in a situation look the temple of God look the word of God he will Sur answer I don't know whether our situations are greater than Resurrection if we believe in Resurrection let us jump hold on to Resurrection and speak to the situations around us that tell them I'm holding on something greater is that amen even if you drag me with what whether you do it to me I am looking unto my redeemer at the last day he will come back again if it is poverty and poverty is not going away church together speak poverty and say the Bible tells me the me shall inhal the Earth take into that Dimension him and he will give [Music] is that amen because you have gone beyond what human being is is that amen because these are just Shadows of what is going to be there what God is giving us it's just a shadow amen the Christians never die defeated they die Victorious is that Amen in the last moment they are calling upon God and the devil is always wondering in every situation AIS will call upon amen do you love the Lord so when life is over and our journey is complet and and the devil has taken a hold of us remember he to Deliver Us From The JO of death toiv us from the Jo of all darkness that theil c Upon Us amen and is able to change your day into a beautiful we going to have a day of rejoicing it is going to be there and what is it he gives us a for Shadow here amen we come and begin to Rejoice why it's a forest of the glory amen and the devil is wondering this is the personed that there is no helled everything is useless that they teach there and then he sees you rejoicing and rejoicing T of the Amen in finishing DayM can from verse it says I have said the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved my heart isad and my glory rejoices My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope amen I've set the Lord before me since I've been a all I have known is Christ that I since I gave my life to Christ all I have known is his word set before me every Sunday morning I've suspended many programs I said the Lord before me in the evening I've suspended many things said the Lord before me I've always gotten my time to read the Bible my time to pray got my time to sing I set my heart before God and I will not be moved why I know him is that amen my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh also shall rest in amen for thou not leave my soul in Hell neither will th suffer th Holy One to see corruption th show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at TH right hand there are Pleasures forever more Am David talks about the body talks about the spirits about the soul said will all rest in peace God will not live my soul in hell why he says I am he I have the keys of Hell amen my body shall rest in why he says I've got the keys of death the of the gra what was it David he went into the day of Jesus Christ this scripture here it wasn't just David speaking was the spirit of Jesus Christ speaking there amen David as a human being he died his body got is that amen but when he was speaking speaking of Jesus Christ and when you are in Jesus Christ and you worship Jesus Christ talk about Jesus Christ and sing about Jesus Christ you are singing about yourself you are talking about yourself when you call him a redeemer you are inside of there when you call him a Healer inside of him there so I will worship him my heart will be glad I will never fear any evil David could backslide would fall down he would rise up again why says he's a man after God's Own Heart his heart was knitted with God said amen and he went to the resurrection and when he spoke like that it was over I fear no evil you are with me my God you are my comforter when I'm walking through the shadow no evil because you are with me what was he looking the resurrection christianis is going to be a day and it may not be very long is that amen because the B is telling us that have gone before us they are crying and they saying how long and the Bible tells us the briide and the spirit they saying come Lord come Lord and change us them that have gone before us they want to take off this body they want to be changed those of us who are here we also want to be changed and the B saying the whole nature is also groing so everything want a resurrection they want a change and how soon is it going to be very soon says when you see these things what do you do lift up your heads because your Redemption is drawing what is that Redemption amen the Bible tells us everything you know the soul has been redeemed amen but the last thing has got to be redeemed is dis amen so when you see those things happening lift up your heads lift up your souls get into pray the Redemption of our bodies is drawing now is that amen the change is already here is that amen started getting into it soon and very soon we are going to see our King soon and very soon this body shall be changed and we shall put on an IM body soon and very soon the tears will be over entering into a dimension where there are no more tears where there no more sickness where there is no more night where there is no more bullet where there is no more of this the things of the world entering into that body soon and very soon let the bride pray for the let the pray for the resurrection of the let the pray for the change of that's the final thing and all the things in between here God is able to handle them if we handle that give our lives that all is now possible may the good Lord bless you amen we are looking for his coming the resurrection morning amen and when the Lord comes here we shall be like him this body is here that limited by space limited by matter when we rise up we shall be like him are still talking he comes he was not lied while he was in the body they would wait for him when the sea was becoming troubled but when he rose up before they before before they could think he was already there and he would go he doesn't need a is that Amen in that body is a very wonderful time a very glorious body upon that may the good Lord bless you amen am shalom shalom we shall be meeting with the few maybe in the afternoon be with you thank you God bless you amen God bless you have you been blessed [Applause] praise the Lord so we are very excited if the spirit that Rose Christ from the dead dwells in you he Quicken your mot bodies he's already on the side of you so I would rather say you are caring the resurrection power with you all the time amen so it starts from the inside that's where our Resurrection begins from because we know about the double portion the inside must be quickened if the inside is quickened by the BM of the Holy whether the body wants or it doesn't want when the time comes it will follow in the resurrection because Paul says and you as quickened who were dead in sin and trespasses even when you were dead in sins has he quickened us so potentially we are quickened we are changed people we are on a journey we may be wounded here and there I want tell you that at the end of The Journey the brother says it shall be there so the same power of the Resurrection that dwells in you is the same power that quickens your inner man when you feel like you have slackened in your Christian [Music] Life your Revival is also a sign of the Resurrection that I may know him in the power of his resurrection this power of the Resurrection this power the forces of backsliding that always tries to cow into our lives amen so what are you looking for are you looking for the living from among the dead why do you keep yourself among the dead amen so we live a separate life in preparation for our body change we are separated people for the Master's use so the call is come out of my people amen and be separate enjoy your resurrection power that on the side of you make every service count for you amen have fellowship with the Brethren let you put that atmosphere in your house amen if you don't have anything put the service and remind yourself about the resol yeah just going put it back and tell Satan you are trying to kill me but you will not and the brother told us you tell the devil I'm holding on the power of the Resurrection amen whether the storms strike or the earthquakes hit amen let me show you something here keep up in this company don't be found among the dead keep up in this company do you know what this company is it's those that are going to a mouse the brother spoke about them and as they were going along with him maybe they didn't have the greater Revelation but the life on the inside there was already on theast side and as they kept walking it kept growing as they kept walking it kept growing you may not know much now but the fact that there is something that brings in Fellowship here keeping company walking towards the M you are going to get to a point when the bread is broken and you say it has always been the Lord and it will change your way of life it will change your attitudes because you know that all alone it has been the growing revelation of Christ amen do you love him Amen Let brother Moses come down here amen that Resurrection morning you know what you are already there but you are waiting for your body to catch up with you because we already in the Heavenly place in Christ Jesus you are just waiting for this to catch up with this and then there will be a body change God bless you amen as you keep holding up don't get out of that company to a m the master is there with he brings brother Robert he breaks the word in a different way he brings brother James he certain until someday you are going to catch the Revelation why something has gripped you out and you came back to and you come again one of
