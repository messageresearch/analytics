he has given unto us to come and around Throne of mercy and also allowing me to speak to you tonight and also appreciate the pastor for giving us the opportunity to also come and speak to the purchase of blood amen so I want to welcome you to uh to the service tonight and we shall get to the Book of Genesis 37 and read about uh Joseph amen chapter 37 and we shall pick it from verse 12 amen amen it saysand and his Brethren went to feed their father's flock in sheim and Israel said unto Joseph do not do not thy Brethren feed the flock in sheim come and I'll send thee unto them and he said to him here am I and he said to him go I pray the see whether it be well with thy Brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the veil of Hebron and he came to shake him [Music] and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what and he said I seek my brethren tell me I pray thee where they feed their flocks and the man said they are departed hence and for I heard them say let us go to to Dothan and Joseph went after his Brethren and found them in Dothan and when they saw him a far off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and wish we will say some evil Beast have divided him and we shall see what will become of his dreams may the Lord add a blessing to his word we may get seen so we are reading about the story here of Joseph and we've all heard about Joseph and his story praise the lord we know that Joseph was one of the children of Israel the children of Jacob and he was a special man he had a special gift from the Lord in other words he had a special favor from the Lord because he had a special favor even his father loved him from his from his childhood he exhibited certain character he was a little bit different so he could have dreams then he could come tell his father about the dreams and each time he did that his brothers were angry they became jealous of him and from where we have picked it from now hisen had gone to look after flock and now his father wanted know about them and how they were doing and how the flock was doing so now as they were down in the bush he comes and now he finds them and the first thing while he was looking for them anly wanting to know how they were doing and he wanted to take information back to the father different with their brothers for them when they saw him it was an opportunity to get rid of him praise the Lord and they said now let us slay him and cast him in some pit and we will say some evil Beast has divide him and we shall see what will become of his dreams they wanted to get rid of the dreams in other words they were trying to fight against the anointing that Joseph had received of the Lord when they got the opportunity to slay him they said let us slay him for they thought that when they get rid of him they would get rid of the plan of God praise the Lord but as we shall see down the road we see that everything that was happening to Joseph was after the patterns of God and the Bible says in verse 21 and Reuben had heard it and delivered him out of their hands and said not kill him Reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might read him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again and it came to pass when was come into his father into his unto his Brethren that they strip Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearings spicy and B and Maya going and Judah said unto his Brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood come let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren we content and see Joseph was a very calm man and they kept tossing him here and there because of the anointing that he was carrying so now they got a hold of him and they sold him and They Carried him over to Egypt praise the Lord and then they came and deceived their father but now it wasn't over with him even when he reached Egypt he still had to go through another toll praise the Lord when he reached out there and he found himself again the house of pharaoh again Pharaoh's wife bled after him praise the Lord because he was a man praise the Lord was a very faithful man he had learned of his father and he had a special anointing he could not fall at the test that God had laid him before the wife of pharaoh even even when he had passed it praise the Lord Pharaoh's wife assed him which landed him into trouble and he was cast into prison praise the Lord he leaves his father sold by his brothers then he's in a Strange Land accused praise the Lord and he's thrown into prison and then he begins to Ser the sentence praise the Lord we want to see the nature praise the Lord the nature of Joseph and how God dealt with him through all these troubles praise the Lord and for our text this evening we shall be looking at through it all through it all which is a Christian's theme is a Believer song is a believer's theme it is our topic praise the Lord through it all God is always patient with his plan God is always patient with his people and through it all he remains God so now we see that this man Joseph after he thrown there and he serving the anointing of the Lord was still with him but the prophet says at some point God allows us to feel the weight praise the Lord he allows us to feel some weight no wonder the song writer says must Jesus bear the cross alone praise the Lord even when we are bearing the cross God is still patient with us and is still faithful to his promises that through it all he comes to our refuge praise the Lord Joseph is thr and he's suffering and now at some point people dream one of his inates dream some of two prisoners had a dream and they were confused of the dream then because J God had chosen Joseph and Joseph was a special man with a special [Applause] anointing no matter where they had thrown him the anointing of God never left him God still walked with him through the pit walked with him when was selling him he walked with him when they when he went to Pharaoh's house even when he was accused God saw him and God could not protect him at that point because God had a purpose for Joseph life praise the Lord all that God could do was preserve Joseph through it all such that the plan of God must come to pass praise the Lord so now he's in prison and two inates dream and now because God is with him praise the Lord he tells him of the interpretation of the dream then he interprets and one of them praise the Lord is freed and Joseph is left he continues to serve praise the Lord but it was the purpose of God these two inates have a dream and they are freed such that it is the two inmates one of them had to carry the testimony about the work that God was doing in Joseph through to Pharaoh praise the Lord so Joseph is there suffering in prison then on the other hand God visits him once again and now Pharaoh gets a dream and Confused of what it is but because God had planted one of these praise the Lord he carried the testimony over to pharaoh and now when Pharaoh heard about the existing of Joseph regardless of whether Joseph had committed a sin that the wife accused him or not and Pharaoh was being furious with Joseph because of this that had happened he needed to know what the dream was all about and he only to be Joseph to give him the interpretation that was the purpose of God he caused him to have the dream that that Joseph could not it was time for him to be pulled out of prison it was now the plan of God Joseph lears patience he's taken to prison and he's patient yes he can dream and he can make interpret but he was he wasn't proud about it he couldn't go on telling people about the dreams and interpretations there are he often waited upon the Lord and now when he waited on the Lord Pharaoh has a dream and he needs a Joseph to come and give the interpretation so they have to ask Joseph out of prison come and give the interpretation praise the Lord And now when Pharaoh listens and is convinced Joseph from prison the grace of God lifts him up and he became the Prime Minister next to Pharaoh the one who was in charge of over all the stores praise the Lord but that wasn't the plan of God ends there God had a special purpose a special plan why Joseph had to suffer at the hands of his brothers thrown and sold accused and imprisoned now he is the primer of the entire country that wasn't enough God was trying to preserve his own seed God had seen what would be the land what was going to before the land and he noticed that Israel and his children could not survive praise the Lord the drought and the famine that was going to come so now when the brothers thought that were doing Mischief against against Joseph God was watching and it was the plan of God preserves Joseph's life until he becomes Prim God could not allow Joseph to remain the house of of pharaoh when he was not yet rained when he was not yet ready God had got rid of him God allowed Joseph to feel the weight of trou to feel the weight of persecution but yet God had a plan for Joseph praise and now when Israel heard of the news that his son had been killed and the Animals had divided he cried he became so sorrowful and sad God watched over him praise the Lord remember Israel had come into continents with God and he knew God God knew him but God could not show him the vision that his son was still alive God still concealed the inspiration until the right time praise the Lord so now sometimes the prophet says God conceals it God conceals this inspiration best of the weight of the situation to prepare and preserve us for the best that God has planned and prepared for us he allowed Joseph to go through it and at end of the day God brought him up and elevated him to a position and the Bible says in Romans 5 ver1 justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into his grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God praise the name of the Living God so now as Believers as the Bride of Jesus Christ the Bible has said we have access into his grace by faith now through through it all through all the TRS that God could allow our way the element of faith that drives us and we GL into the grace of God to preserve and protect us and to make us stand the test of time and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God not only so but we glory in tribulations knowing that tribulation Works patience patience experience and experience hope so now we notice that that Joseph had patience when his brother thrown when they threw him he didn't fight back he was patient with them why because he had had the dreams and he had seen his dreams come to pass so he knew that there was a God who gave him his these dreams and gave him the interpretation this God would not allow him to die could not allow him to be destroyed so he had that patience he he had the faith to go through whatever life he was going through knowing that God was present with him praise the Lord when they choed him of of a wanting Pharaoh's wife he he he he not defend himself enough it was a test that was brought before him it is a weight that he had to carry for that which God had planned for him ahead praise the Lord and the prophet says in the message God has pro has a provided way 1956 and that's the way it is today God has made a way to destroy that cancer God has made a way to take the blindness out of them eyes God has made a way that are we God has made a way and what are we trying to do with with this word build something for you to write through on your Victory God's word thus says the Lord see thus says the Lord read through on his word God said so after a while when God got ready for it to happen when was speaking about the rains says the rain was up there praise the Lord and says all right he did the same thing he was going to glorify himself in the Hebrew children speaking about the Hebrew children praise the Lord these were God's children we have often spoken about the Hebrew children there are a special encouragement to us in moments of trouble these children praise the Lord they are very faithful with God praise the Lord and the prophet says they did not have any promises written down for them to read that they could read and say God you promised this praise the Lord but they moved through it all by faith praise the Lord he says they didn't have any promise they couldn't get back there and read in the Bible and say Lord you promise in your word of your children ever went into a fair furnace you deliver them all right we are coming right there down well that wouldn't have been so hard just their faith because God had already promised it but God had not promise them so but here is the words they heard God was so real to them they said our God is able praise the Lord now God was watching over those children he was watching over the situation he was watching over the and because God knew that these were faithful children he wouldn't allow them to go through the furnace you would have done something to stop them from going there you even come down and he could pour maybe water upon the furnace to make it cool and run and fire runs out but God didn't do that he was watching over them he was watching over the situation he was allowing them to feel the weight of the situation such that they could learn patience with God prise the Lord they knew that God would deliver them because they knew that God would do it but even when they reached the door of the Furnace they still saw that the fire was still burning yet God was watching them enter the furnace praise the Lord it does not mean that God had deserted them but God had a plan for that he had his special plan praise the Lord because if maybe God had run down the fire the people would not see the hand of the Lord in the fire praise the Lord but he had to allow them to go through the fire enter into the furnace at the end of the day the people would see the hand of the Lord in the fire and now even to M and his friends they had to learn patience with God they knew God delivered them and yet God allowed them to enter in that's why the prophet says God sometimes allows us to feel the weights praise the Lord he allowed Joseph to the we thrown into the pit sold out in the land drawn into prison but it was all the purpose of God whatever life has to do with us as children of God as people that have believed on his word that have gotten a promise we know that whatever life has to bring to us God has not allowed it to come it will never come that if it comes still God has the ability to deliver us out of it now through it all we need to Anchor our faith on his promises praise the Lord he says this did not have the promise but they said our God is able how about that the fail that don't believe in Divine Healing they said our God is able we can find that in Daniel chapter 3 we pick it from 17 says if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning F furnace that's all they had he is able and because he is able if we get in there he will deliver us out of your verse 22 God is able Deliver Us come this very furnace but we will not bow down to your images and when they walk down to the F upon bear she faith that God was able not that he promised but that he was able God sent Christ in the furnace and fire away from them and protected them and brought them out by Saving God is by the saying God is able the Lord that's all they had is able and now for us we have a promise praise the lord we have a promise we have a cloud of witness praise the Lord when we get through situations of life we have the word to refer to we see that the same God M confessed that he was able that same God is able to deliver me out of this situation and he is a faithful God based upon our faith in his promises based upon our faith in his words he is still faithful to deliver us out praise the Lord now you don't come saying God is able you don't have to come to that you promised God you promised you prepared it at Calvary and have come to receive it it's your preparation the prophet says now for us we have the promise so now we have to meet God according to his promises praise the Lord when when when the children of Israel at one time we talked about them in the Sunday School when God wanted destroy them when when Moses had gone to meet God in Mount Si and while he was receiving the Commandments and they were here impatient and now they went on to make a golden cup worship and when God saw it and he was very angry with them and he wanted destroy them and he was determined to destroy them now we see one Moses coming Moses had nothing else to stand on to remind God God from from from destroying his people he stood on the promise God had met with Abraham he stood with the promise that God had met with Israel out of them he would make a great nation and when he reminded God out you said you promise you promised Abraham that out of him will come a great nation if he destroy his people where shall that Nation come from and when God looked at his promise he it repented God and God repented and he never destroyed them and now to us Believers we have the promises in the word and we are sure that the promises of God yes and amen God promises and he fulfills praise the Lord even if he has not fulfilled anything in your life you have about him he made a promise when he sent the angel the Angel and the angel came down and said Mary you shall conceive without knowing a man you shall conceive and we see that it came to pass Andy conceived prises the Bible we see Father Abraham God promised that you have a child even if you've not seen another person having a child at least you have read and you believe that God promise Abraham him a child that's why the prophet says here praise the Lord that you should stand on the Promises of God the Lord when you going through it all promise you remind God that you made a promise and I have faith in your promises and God is faithful and you'll get us through and he says you'll go away a different person when you meet God at his promises and you have faith in his promises you go away a different person you go away with SE an anchor inside your soul that nothing can upset you you know that you are healed when you're sick you know that you are healed because it is in the promises of God he promised that he will heal all our diseases not some but all our diseases so now what is that disease that is too big before the eyes of the Lord that is so big before the Lord praise the Lord now you meet God at his promise and you remind him of your healing he gives you your healing bu upon your Fai say you know that God has taken care of of this matter for you because he has promised he gives testings and trials with these promises many times he let the Hebrew children feel the weights Fire coming upon them but yet he could not allow them to be burned we may carry a weight it could be a weight of a disease it could be a weight of some kind of trouble be weight of a spiritual condition and somehow God could allow you to feel that weight the same God is watching over you and the same God still faithful to take you through it all praise the Lord you may carry it and sometimes we become impatient and we begin to complain to God praise the lord it's not news praise the Lord job he was a faithful man a very perfect man the most perfect on the face of the Earth God was confident about him but yet God allowed the devil when Satan wanted to prove himself that he would come and play around with job's life God allowed it he said I am very confident about my child there is nothing you can do about him because he has received of my life job had the life of God in so he was a faithful man job was a prophet praise the Lord and now we notice what God did God concealed this vision from job and allowed job to test the weight allowed him to feel the weight and when Satan came and struck God job's children God was watching and he was still faithful through it praise the Lord job started crying God was watching Praise the Lord not that God was not feeling the pain but God had a special plan for the life of Job and even when job's flock and his home was destroyed God was watching praise the Lord but God concealed job from seeing this vision and yet job was a prophet who Could See Vision praise the Lord but God had a purpose to prove to the devil that he could not do anything to take away the faith that job had received sometimes sometimes God sees the devil Satan coming around our lives he may play with our health prise the Lord God is seeing he is watching but God is confident of one sure thing the faith that he has given unto you that the devil regardless of these troubles he cannot take away that faith regardless of how hard the devil F he brought cancer and's body and he began roting yet never denounced his faith in God and God was watching he was waiting for the time Appo to prove devil that he couldn't take away the fa some when he felt was becoming so heavy when he was testing of the weight he now began complaining to God and now at that point it is the point that God was waiting himself to come and meet with job praise the Lord this this point God never sends a messenger he will not send another person come and speak to you God himself comes down speaks your heart had now tested the way and God was convinced praise the Lord now God came down he didn't allow job to over complain because he saw that he was a just man and now he came to him and he now started taking away the cover he took off the seal one by one and started reminding him that you job you are a prophet you are able to see these things you you are the Son of God you have received this word you have this promise and these promises are written in the Bible get down to the word began reading for him one by one now job when God had taken off the cover began to see the Lord that's when God asked him where were you when the Sons and Daughters of God for joy and now when he heard that voice God had taken off the cover he got into the vision and he saw himself there and he saw himself even if he was roting see his skin dropping but saw a young job why because God had taken off the cover job entered into the expression and he was able to see the plan of God noticed suffering that was going through was but for a moment but there after there is a body that is awaiting him and then when he saw it now God remind that you are not to suffer this has been for a moment you are a special person you are my child and I have made you you are my own you've gone through this situation children have died you come so poor you lost your job you lost your reputation but yet you are job you are my son I have not you I have left you just get down to the word and see your name and see your promises and see that the promises of God are sure and amen and now when we come to that point God steps in he steps in Praise the Lord and the anointing come through praise the Lord now he begins to speak to you individually that's the point when you get the bible to read the scripture you get exactly to that point that he speaking about your situation you come you come to fellowship and the pastor is speaking he speaks exactly to your heart condition that is the point when God has had your complaining and now he has come to speak to your heart remind you that you're a special person remind you that you're a special remind that you not die in the situation there that faithful and that he is faithful and he will deliver you through it all but what we learn from all the situations we learn to be faithful to his promises we learn to be faithful to his words we learn to keep our faith anchored on the promise of God God sometimes allows us to feel the weight look at Daniel a very faithful man Daniel had been tested praise the Lord he had been tested and at some point Nez was going to kill all of them and still he tested of the goodness of the Lord and God gave him the dream and interation thereof and now this was a point God was still Wasing over Daniel but this point Daniel had to feel the weight when they conspired against him and the King ordered that Daniel be thrown into the den God Wasing over him Wasing over Daniel he saw Daniel marching he saw him being tied and he saw the animals the Lions being stared and they were very hungry and anything that was thrown in there be smashed and crushed God was washing over the situation and when he was smashing the Landes were roaring when they had the vibration of people coming through they began lowering and and now Daniel still Maring he was thrown in there and he became so frightened he had to feel the weight the says he saw the animals coming with open tooths were open ready to grab him that's when God sent the angel to cover Daniel and protected him from the Lions situations will come even families things will get bad for a Believer because that's what Satan is looking for to distort your life to make you miserable to make you worried all the time that you lose your concentration you lose your faith Daniel even when he was thrown in there he knew that God would still him he had his Fai on God because God had done it for him before and he was still faithful to help him so many times we have heard people say there are stories of how God has delivered them praise the Lord but then to us we may see things are not moving he said but the other day brother give a testimony he had this kind of chronical disease and he said God delivered him for me I have suffered and I prayed but God has not come through for me just keep your faith keep waiting on the Lord he's watching over you and he knows exactly when he'll step on the scene to deliver you out praise the Lord and some of us may complain say but God I went to school praise the Lord and I finished school and my friends that finish with me gotten jobs I've have gone to the pastor to pray for me to get a job I have fasted and prayed I have not got the job praise the Lord the Bible says at the time when job started complaining God came on the scene and spoke to him be faithful with God have faith and trust that through it all is there with you God has never left his own he gave us a promise that he shall never leave us first Peter 3:2 for the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous his ears are attentive to their prayers keep trusting the Lord keep your face and keep praying God is seeing you God shall come and will see you through and he also says in Psalms 121 he will he will not let your food sleep through the situations in life will not let your foot sleep He Who Watches Over you will not Slumber if he never slumbered at the sitation of if he never sled the Lord at the situation of Joseph never sled the Hebrew children never slumbered Daniel when he was in the den never slumbered when David was meeting the Philistines he will not Slumber at your situation he will not Slumber at your spiritual condition he is still a just God who keeps his promises indeed He Who Watches Over Israel He Who Watches Over You will never slumber nor sleep he watches over you he watches over your health he watches over your business your family over your children he watches over your life he watches over your faith and his grace is all present with us and he's concerned about our Affairs praise the Lord he may allow us to test the weight but yet is faithful to see us through he says your Sarah your wife Sarah is going to give a birth Boy Child give to a son 25 years later they have a son praise the Lord but it had to take patience it had to take their faith praise the Lord even if you have a small Faith left hang on that Faith praise the Lord even if you have a very small Faith raise up on that Fai and pray and wait on the Lord he shall stand upon that little face lift you up to himself stand upon that little face lift you out of your situation he is a just God and remember he has not saved you doesn't provide for you based upon your good character praise the Lord he says by Grace you are saved and I chose you Lord by Grace he chooses us and it is upon him to keep us in his grace let's just keep our faith the road may seem to be so rough but let us keep our Fai I take few quotes here he says the prophet says the message I have heard but now I see so then as soon as you get these places you know that it's been revealed to you by the word of God Revelation by the word that God requires you to do then you have faith now just like Abraham when he was 99 years old I believe appear this old now 9 years old when he was almost 100 years old that God had been waiting upon that promise that that had been waiting upon that promise all these years appear to him the name of el Shai he appeared to him in the name of el shed God and what an encouragement it was yet the promise wasn't fulfilled then Abra but Abraham I am the almighty God the strength Giver the breasted God he was waiting he had become so old and God visited him the name El the Blessed God the strength Giver he shall Vis me he shall visit you in that time as El the breasted God the strength giver and when your strength is run out he shall give you the strength to rise up because at the end of the day each of us must have the strength of us must have the anointing each of us must have that fire each of us must have the power to get into the Rapture so even when your faith is running low hold on to the promises of God hold on to the word of God for he promised that he's coming for a church he's coming for the brides and you will be sure that he is coming for me praise the Lord hold onto that Faith he says like I've told you before like the little baby that is Fring and sick and crying lays upon his mother's breast and nures his strength back from her because it is satisfied where it is ning because the only access has a knows of it of of his his mother's breast he knows no other do of medicine you might give him a dose of medicine he would SC and cry give him a shot in the arm and he would carry on but the only access to satisfy him is the mother's bre said Abraham you are old your strength is gone your arms are withed up but I am your mother just take a hold of my promise and be satisfied while you are waiting he says I am your strength he spoke to Abraham and says Abraham it's me who gave you the promise and I am your strength in your promise keep holding on and be satisfied while you're waiting he has given a promise let's be satisfied where we are waiting be rested through it all be rested keep your trust have your faith focused on the word which has promised and be rested child of God now that's the way every believer no matter how bad the cancer is got how long you've been sitting in a wheelchair any of these things just if you can grasp that Revelation from God then be satisfied knowing that it's going to happen because faith Waits patiently for for the promise rest assured through it all be rested rest upon his unchanging hand oh it could be the trouble with our faith but hold on the word of God it could be trouble with a family issue we've got people that have prayed that keep telling us each time we remind them of God are sure and he never fails brother five years seven years I have prayed and have not seen a child but he says be rested
