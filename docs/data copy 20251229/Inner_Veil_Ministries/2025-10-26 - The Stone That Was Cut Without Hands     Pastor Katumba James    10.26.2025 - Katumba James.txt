Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, how we love you so much that you first loved us and you saved us, Lord. How our hearts rejoice to sing about these precious things, what you have done. And now we pray heavenly father that you may take charge heavenly lord speak to our hearts the words of eternal life and we are grateful lord and all these other things are going to pass away but your word will never pass away and we want to receive that eternal portion that will transform our lives. bless us all together in the name of the Lord Jesus. We pray and ask this. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us go to the book of Daniel. Daniel chapter 2. Then we are reading from verse Daniel chapter 2. We're reading from verse 31 to verse 35. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Though, O king, so and behold, a great image. This great image whose brightness was excellent stood before you, and the form thereof was terrible. This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass. His legs of iron, his feet of iron and part of clay. Though so still that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and clay, and break them to pieces. [Music] Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of summer. Three things flows, and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them. And the stone that smought the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. May God bless of his word. You may be seated. So my subject, the stone cut without hands. We've read this in Daniel chapter 2:34. Daniel 2:34 that though still a stone was cut out without hands, So we want to take time and look at what this stone is and what impact you know on the image. Praise the name of our Lord. Now you notice here that Nebuchadnezzar you know he was the king of Babylon &gt;&gt; and Babylon was a great empire. you know, it was big. It was dominating all the known parts of the world all over the world. And now Nebuchadnezzar as the king, praise the name of our Lord. Now Nebuchadnezzar as the king, you know, he was of course put on that throne by God. You remember when God was telling the children of Israel that I will send my servant Nebuchadnezzar. So he allowed Nebuchadnezzar to go and take the children of Israel into captivity. And so when the children of Israel were taken into captivity into Babylon, praise the name of our Lord. Daniel is one of those unac you know living in the kingdom of Babylon. Nowadar he had a dream at night and when he dreamt at night he forgot the dream. And so now one thing he would remember in the morning I dreamt But he wouldn't tell what he dream. So then he went to the wise men and he told them tell me my dream and what the dream means. They told him it's not possible for us to tell you your dream. You tell us your dream then we shall tell you the interpretation. Then he said you are looking for reasons to deceive me. He demanded it. &gt;&gt; Now that's very interesting that you know he said tell me what I dreamt and tell me what it means. And the Bible says it's only God who knows the secret things. You know the things that are concealed. So now he commanded that all the wise men be put to death because they told the king the his dream or even the interpretation. And then they came to Daniel and then his other fellows and they were telling them we are going to kill you because you told the king the dream. Then Daniel told his friends, "Let us pray. There is a dream the king had and he forgot it and he wants to kill all the wise men of Israel." So they prayed and then the Bible says God revealed the secret to Daniel. Praise the name of our Lord. And our God works in ways that are beyond understanding. Like the children who are doing examination, who are going to do examination, you pray to God, Lord, give me wisdom to understand the question and then be able to interpret the question to give the right answer to the question or maybe in some issues in your life, some things you don't understand, some things you don't know about, you can pray to the Lord. I said Lord reveal this thing to me. Lord show me what this thing mean. But now also another thing we need to understand is that God cannot bring a mysteriously without appointing a person there who is going to interpret it. There was no way God would give far a dream if there was no Joseph God. And this is what brother Brandham teaches us, you know, because dreams if they are mysterious, they need to be interpreted by the prophet. But yet, not all dreams are mysterious. There are dreams that are plain. You know, like when Joseph dream, the angel telling him, "Don't fear to take your wife Mary." That was an open dream. Then when God told Joseph, take Jesus to Egypt, it need didn't need an interpretation because there was no prophet at that time to interpret that dream. But now by the time since a dream with a mystery, there must be a prophet he has appointed to interpret that dream. Praise the name of our Lord. There's somebody who called me. I think it was on a radio program. He said, "I dreamt. I was in forest. I was in Mira forest." Then I said, then he said, "What does it mean?" I told him I'm not an interpreter of dreams. Praise the name of Allah. You know people want to go by dreams. Then there is somebody who has written a book on dreams and then he said when you get a dream like this it means this when you get this put away those things. Praise the name of God. If God gives you a dream, he will give you the understanding of it. You pray over it and then the Lord will show you what it's meaning. Praise the name of our Lord. So when Daniel got the dream, when he saw the vision of the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, God gave him the interpretation. Even now in the times of brother brother people would come with dreams and then they tell him their dreams and what God does he reveals to the prophet what you have dreamt and then he gives him the interpretation. That's how the Lord does it. And brother Brandham would say you came and told me your dream but you forgot a lot of things. Then is the one who reminds the one who has dreamt that you dreamt like this. You were here said yes yes yes that is true so that so that you can believe that the interpretation is correct. Praise the name of our Lord. Like when you would tell people in discernment for example that congressman congressman opera who came to the meeting brotherham told him about his past life things that he knows in private alone. He told him ABCD then he told him God has healed you stand up. Then the the WIFE TOLD HIM, "NO, DON'T." THEN the the congressman told the wife, "If he can tell me things I know alone, he knows even what is in the future. Praise the name of our Lord." LIKE MOSES, GOD SHOWED HIM THE PAST. In the beginning, God created heaven and earth. YOU ASK MOSES, "WHERE were you? So if you would to see what is in THE PAST WHERE HE wasn't then you should believe HIM FOR TELLING YOU WHAT is going to be in the future. And this is the message that we have. Praise the name of our Lord telling us what IS IN THE PAST TELLING US WHAT IS in the present. So we should believe for even what is in the future. Praise the name of our Lord. So now when Daniel got this dream, he said there was an image very exceedingly dreadful image, &gt;&gt; an image of a human being. Then it had the head of God. Now Daniel interprets the head of God in Daniel chapter 2. And then verse 37, he says, "Though O king at the King of Kings, the God of heaven has given you a kingdom and power and strength and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the falls of the heaven, He has given them into thy hand and has made thee ruler over them all. You are this head of God and God is excellent, you know. So the kingdom of Babylon, you know, was that HEAD OF GOD NOW WE NEED ALSO TO understand that the days of the Gentiles they start from that time when Nebuchadnezzar took over Jerusalem. So the days of the Gentiles ruling over Jerusalem started with Nebuchadnezzar and until now Jerusalem is not full in the hands of Israel. Palestine demanding half of Jerusalem. The international community they said Jerusalem is an international city. So it doesn't belong to only one country. They have dominion over it. And so YOU SEE THAT ALL THE BATTLES OF MIDDLE East are focused on Jerusalem. The Muslims have the eastern part. the Arabs where they have that mosque and that mosque is in the same place of Solomon's temple. The Jews want to go back to worship. The Muslims said this belongs to us. Praise the name OF ALLAH. BUT ALL this the dominion of Jerusalem started in the days of Nebuchadnezzar. Praise the name of our Lord. So now he said you are the the gohead of God. And then he says then after you in verse 39 shall arise another kingdom inferior to you. So now you will notice here that the head of God is a kingdom gentile kingdom. And then NOW FROM THE HEAD of God, &gt;&gt; there was the breast and the the arms and the belly of of silver. And that was the Persian Median kingdom. And then from that there was the thighs of brass. That was the Greek kingdom. Then after that there was the legs of iron. And then the feet the feet part of iron and part of clay. That's the Roman kingdom. Now we can pick up a scripture here. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in Daniel chapter 5, And then we read in verse 30, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "In that night was Bela, the king of the child in slain. Now Belshazza was the king of Babylon. of Nebuchadnezzar in verse 31. And Darius the Median took the kingdom being about three score and two years. So we see that the Medians they took over the Babylonian kingdom. So you can see from Babylon the head of God now to actually medi Persian kingdom, you know, the silver of the chest and then the arms and then from the that kingdom there was the Greek kingdom under Alexander the Great. which was actually the size of brass. And then from that we come to the last gentile kingdom. The fourth gentile kingdom which was actually the legs of iron and then the toes of clay and iron and that is the Roman kingdom. And so it was under the Roman kingdom that a stone was cut without hand and then it came and smote the image and it smote. The Bible says it smote the image upon the feet and it broke the iron and clay and broke them to pieces. Iron and clay and brass and silver and gold were all broken up in pieces and taken away. Praise the name of our Lord. Now this is prophecy. Praise the name of the Lord of what will be happening under the gentile kingdom. Now you notice THAT WHEN THE STONE IS CUT, it destroys the whole image. And one thing we also need to know that the kingdoms of this world are the kingdoms of the devil. At the time we are living in, the kingdoms of this world, are the kingdoms of the devil. When Pilate asked Jesus that are you also a king? Let us go to the book of Luke. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Got the book of Luke. And then we can read in Luke chapter 23. And then we read in verse okay I beg your pardon. It is actually John the book of John and then chapter 18 &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse 35 &gt;&gt; Pilate answered am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me. What hast thou done? Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now is my kingdom not from hence. for next. Praise the name of our Lord. So he's saying my kingdoms are not of this world. But the devil testifies that if you will worship me, then I will give you all these kingdoms, for they are delivered unto me. Praise the name of our Lord. In Matthew 4:8, &gt;&gt; again, the devil takes him up into an exceeding high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. and says unto him, "All these things will I give you if you will fall down and worship me." Praise the name of our Lord. Satan saying, "These are my kingdoms." Now you will notice here THAT WHATEVER kingdom was succeeding, the devil was taking ownership of that kingdom. Praise the name of the Lord because he's the prince of the air. He rules the kingdoms of the earth. So now when Daniel was under the Pian kingdom and Daniel prayed, his prayers were held. The answers were heard. Let us go to the book of Daniel. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go the book of Daniel. And then we can read in chapter 10. &gt;&gt; Daniel chapter 10. And then we read in verse 12. Then said he unto me, "Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you did set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God. Thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withtood me one and 20 days. But lo, one of the chief princes came to help me. And I remained there with the kings of Persia. [Music] Now, this was an angel telling Daniel, "From the time you prayed, God had your prayers and I came down to respond to them. But for 21 days, the prince of Persia withtood me. Now we need to know how Satan works. That Satan would try to withhold your blessing. Satan will try to hold the answer of your prayers. So now when your heart is moved to pray over something, don't let it go. Praise the name of our Lord. Keep on believing God. KEEP ON ASKING GOD REGARDLESS OF THE OPPOSITION THAT COMES. Regardless of maybe there is no answer, I HAVE GOT YOU NEED TO HOLD TO THAT. SO EVEN DANIEL, he held to his prayers. HE BELIEVED GOD IS GOING TO ANSWER HIM. So he kept on praying and he didn't know what was happening you know in the spiritual world. And sometimes also we may not know what's HAPPENING IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. BUT YOU NEED not to give up. Praise the name of OUR LORD. DON'T GIVE UP ON THE WORD OF GOD. DON'T GIVE UP ON OPPOSITION. DON'T GIVE UP BECAUSE YOU'RE FRUSTRATED. PRAISE THE NAME OF OUR LORD. DON'T GIVE UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAILED. You just keep on holding on. Praise the name OF OUR LORD KNOWING WHOM you have believed. THAT WAS HOW DANIEL WAS HOLDING ON HIS HAND, PRAYING CONTINUOUSLY. And then the prince of air center was busy resisting the answer OF DANIEL. BUT DANIEL WOULD NOT GIVE IT. PRAISE THE NAME of our Lord. He kept ON PRAYING. HE KEPT ON WAITING ON THE LORD. AND THAT SHOULD ALSO BE THE SAME THING WITH US THAT I'M NOT GIVING UP ON WHAT I DESIRE FROM GOD. REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING, REGARDLESS OF THE FAILURES, REGARDLESS OF THE FRUSTRATION, REGARDLESS OF THE DISAPPOINTMENT, YOU SHOULD NOT give up. Praise the name of our Lord. HE KEPT ON PRAYING UNTIL WHEN THERE was a breakthrough that Satan would not withstand it anymore. Praise the name of our LORD BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS resist the devil and you will flee away. But if the devil comes weak and then you just fall. You're not resisting him. YOU NEED TO RESIST THE DEVIL IN WHATEVER FORM THAT HE COMES. WHATEVER EVIL THOUGHTS THAT HE PUTS UPON YOU, MAYBE YOU KNOW NEGATIVE IMAGINATION OR NEGATIVE ANYTHING, YOU JUST KEEP ON REJECTING IT. Say this is not part of me. I REFUSE THIS. I REJECT SICKNESS. I REJECT FAILURE. Praise the name of our Lord. AND THEN YOU CONFESS IT. PRAISE THE name of our Lord. YOU BE LIKE JOSHUA. WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS. MUCH AS we see THE SONS OF ANAKAH BIGGER THAN US, but let US GO ALL AT ONCE. PRAISE THE NAME OF OUR Lord because we have the promise of God. Praise the name OF OUR LORD. DANIEL NEVER gave up 21 days. He kept on pressing and then the angel gave him the reason. YOU KNOW WHY I'M GLAD TO COME? THE PRINCE OF PERSIA. WHO WAS THE PRINCE OF PERSIA? NOW WE NOTICE THAT Daniel sought God in the days of Cyrus the king of Persia. &gt;&gt; Cyrus, &gt;&gt; not this Cyrus here. Now &gt;&gt; you know in Daniel 10:1 it says in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel. So on earth it was Cyrus the king of Persia. He was the physical king. But then there was a prince of air over that people. So you'll notice that Satan would take the same title of the kingdoms that are ruling THE EARTH RIGHT now is the prince of the world. ALL the kingdoms of the world because there are many kingdoms of the world. We have the kingdom of Uganda, the kingdom of Kenya, kingdom of Tanzania, all these different kingdoms. Now, Satan says, "I'm now the prince. I lure them. I govern them. Praise the name of our Lord." So now, Satan is the prince of the kingdoms of this world. NOW OUR LORD JESUS Christ is the stone that was cut without hand and that stone that was cut without hand comes to smite the image at the time of the Roman Empire. Now we need to realize HERE THAT OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WAS BORN in the Roman Empire. Rome was lulling. You remember the emperor. You know who declared THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GO FOR census and then the Joseph and Mary. They had to go to Bethlehem Judea. SO IT WAS UNDER THE ROMAN Empire that the Lord Jesus Christ was born. AND IT IS STILL UNDER the Roman Empire that the Lord Jesus CHRIST AS A STONE CUT WITHOUT hands and destroys the kingdoms of the Gentile. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message the mark of the beast, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says every Orthodox believer here knows that the gentile reign began with King Nebuchadnezzar. Is that right? Every Orthodox believer is knows that. And King Nebadnezzar had a vision and Daniel gave him the interpretation. Is that right? And it was the head of God which was the Babylonian. The second was Medis and Persian. The next was the Greek Empire. Then the Roman Empire and at the end of the Roman Empire, Jesus Christ was the rock that was held out of the mountains without the hands and rolled in and broke down the image. And then that stone covered the earth. And how that in the last days when they broke up into these many different kingdoms, you know, and so forth the to was iron and clay. And it means the And it means that the prophet said, "As much as though did iron and clay won't mix together, neither will this leave one to another, but they will mingle the seat. In other words, they will marry into them trying to raise their children and break for the powers like that. And you know that's the truth. But a hold of it got now in the message the beginning and the ending of the gentile dispensation. The head of God has passed away as Daniel said it would. The Babylonian kingdom succeeding that he said would be Medis and Persian. They succeeded the Babylonian kingdom and they fell away to who? &gt;&gt; The Grecians. Alexander the Great. And they fell away to what? To the Romans. And the Romans broke up to all the world and the eastern and western rock, two legs. And he said iron and clay was on the toes, the 10 toes. the 10 kingdoms. And he said they would not mix and they intermar among one another, Romanism and Protestantism. And in that day when the thing exists, then the stone that was held out of the mountain without hands and he rolled in and broke the things to pieces and it took the place of the image. Praise the name of our Lord. So you see the kingdoms of the world and now you see that the gentile kingdoms have been doaining over THE EARTH. BUT NOW we are living in the time for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message he says, "And so he come first redeem his bride, second as the rapture, to take away his bride. He comes third with his bride, king and queen. After that's when many people are expecting the coming. Praise the name of OUR LORD. NOW GOD does things in threes. Praise the name of our Lord. You know as father, son and holy ghost not meaning there are three person but the same God, the same person manifesting himself in different ways. So even the Lord Jesus Christ come three times. The first time he came was coming to redeem the bride when he was born here on earth and then the second time he comes. He comes to pick the bride he has redeemed and that is the rapture and that's the time we are living in. We are living in the time for the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So he takes the bride. Praise the name of our Lord. And he's with the bride in the air for three and a half years. He's with the bride in the air for three and a half years. Now the during the time of the three and a half years, it is A GREAT TRIBULATION. AND IT IS DURING these three and a half years that the gospel turns away from the Gentiles and then it goes to the Jews. Praise the name of our Lord. Now at the end of the three and a half years, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST COMES back to rule over the earth. Now when he COMES BACK, HE COMES BACK AS THE STONE CUT WITHOUT HAND. AND THEN HE DESTROYS ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THIS world and he establishes his millennial reign here on earth. Praise the name of OUR LORD. BUT NOW IN THE BIBLE SAYS, let us go to Daniel chapter 2. Praise the name of our Lord. Daniel chapter 2 and then verse 44. The Bible says, "And in the days of the these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and shall stand forever. Guang. Praise the name of our Lord. So we are living in the days of these kings. He said God of heaven to establish his kingdom. And now God is establishing his kingdom by the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. BEHOLD the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And so he's calling men TO BE BORN INTO HIS KINGDOM. ACCEPTING THE LORD JESUS AS THEIR PERSONAL SAVIOR, being born again. We are living in this TIME THAT THE GOSPEL IS GOING FOR ALL MEN. Come in. Praise the name of our Lord. JUST LIKE NOAH WAS CALLING THEM TO enter into the ark, YOU KNOW, HE'S CALLING PEOPLE COME INTO THIS THIRD EXODUS. COME UNTO me you are heavy laden. I will give you rest. Praise the name of our Lord. So Christ praise the name of our LORD TO THE JEWS IN HIS FIRST COMING. He was the rejected stone. HE WAS THE STONE OF STUMBLING. They couldn't understand WHAT HE WAS ABOUT. He blinded them. Praise the name of OUR LORD. BUT NOW TO THE BELIEVERS CHRIST IS A PRECIOUS STONE. Praise the name of our Lord TO THE BELIEVERS. Christ &gt;&gt; is the cornerstone to the believers. CHRIST IS OUR ROCK WHERE WE BASE OURSELVES. Praise the name of our Lord. But then to the unbelievers, it's a crushing stone. Praise the name of our Lord. So now in this message, what was the Holy Ghost given for? He says THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY to find it, THERE WAS A STONE CUT OUT OF THE mountain without hands that rolled into the world and smashed it out and become with a chaff on the threshing floor. Let that stone, the Lord Jesus Christ, that stumbling stone to the world, a stone of offense, you know, a laughing stone, a stumbling stone to the church, but a precious to the believer, stone of assurance, stone of rest, resting. I know that I've passed from death unto life. Praise the name of our Lord to us. This is not a a stone of stumbling. Praise the name of our Lord. It is a stone. Praise the name OF OUR LORD. SO PRECIOUS TO US like the way Peter says in second Peter in first Peter chapter 2. Praise the name of our Lord. First Peter chapter 2. And then if we read from verse 4 to verse 8, the Bible says, "To whom come as a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious, praise the name of our Lord. So to us, Christ is a living stone. CHRIST IS A PRECIOUS STONE. CHRIST IS A CHOSEN STONE. Praise the name of our Lord. AND THEN HE SAYS, "YOU also as lively stones are BUILT UP A SPIRITUAL house and an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." SO NOW WHEN YOU ARE BORN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD, you become a living star. You become a lively star. So you become a habitation of God. When the scripture tells us in Ephesians chapter 2 and then verse 20 THAT WE ARE BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATION OF THE apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ himself. being the chief cornerstone. Praise the name of our Lord. So he has we have been built the VERY LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST through us. Praise the name of our Lord. He says we are livelessly stone BUILD UP A SPIRITUAL HOUSE only priesthood. So we are not on guess work. Maybe I will be in that kingdom. YOU ARE CERTAIN RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE kingdom of God already. We are looking for its manifestation in the physical form but in THE SPIRITUAL FORM. WE HAVE THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIR which is the kingdom of god. So he says we are livelessly stone. WE HAVE BUILT A SPIRITUAL HOUSE. WE ARE A HOLY PRIESTHOOD. WE OFFER UP SPIRITUAL sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Verse six of second chapter 2. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture. Behold I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone elect precious. And he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Praise the name of our Lord. He says he lays a precious stone there, the chief cornerstone. And then he says, he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe, he is precious. But unto them, which be disobedient, &gt;&gt; THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS DISALLOW, the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling, a rock of offense. EVEN TO THEM WHICH STUMBLE AT THE word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So you can see Christ the stone. Praise the name of our Lord. We are not waiting just for him to BE THE STONE CUT out of WITHOUT GOD. BUT TO US right now, it is the chief cornerstone. All our faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ. And if our faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ, THE WAY THE BIBLE HAS TOLD US THAT WE ARE BUILT UPON THE foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus being the chief cornerstone. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? ALL OUR TEACHING, all our belief is based on what is given in the Bible. Praise the name of the Lord. The apostles, they never preached trinity baptism. They never preached that. THE APOSTLES NEVER PREACHED WOMEN PREACHING. They never preached that. THE APOSTLES NEVER PREACHED baptizing little children. SO ALL THOSE THINGS CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE. They don't have a chief cornerstone as Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. THE APOSTLES NEVER PREACH A trinity of three persons in one. They preach THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD. Praise the name of our Lord. WE HAVE BUILT ON THAT cornerstone Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our LORD BEING THE CHIEF STONE. AND NOW YOU NOTICE THAT WHEN THEY WERE BUILDING THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON, they were getting stones from different countries. AND THERE WOULD BE VERY BIG stone from Arabia, from you know Median, from Italy, from different countries. They were cutting them from the mountain. THEN THEY WOULD load them on the boats and things like that. and they would bring them to Jerusalem. NOW WHEN THE stones were at Jerusalem, nobody cut them there. There was no hammer on any stone. AND THAT'S HOW GOD PICKS US. He picks us from different background. Praise the name of the Lord. HE PICKS US FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. Some come from the south. Some come from the east. Some come from the north, some come from THE WEST. WHAT IS IT? GOD PICKING his elect all over the earth and then he brings them together. Praise the name of the Lord. He gives them his word. He gives them HIS SPIRIT AND ALL OF US WE COME TOGETHER AS the temple of the living God. Praise the name of our Lord. So they WERE GETTING THIS STONE. PRAISE THE NAME of our Lord. AND EACH STONE WAS REPRESENTING a member of the body of Christ receiving the same Holy Spirit. So this stone builds here, another stone builds there, another there. That's why we cannot do the same thing in the body of Jesus. One is doing this, another is doing this, another is doing this. YOU FIND THIS ONE IS good at this. You find this one is good at this. Anyone is good at this? What are we doing? We are building the temple. And when we are building the temple, the Bible say, let each joint supply. So what is your position in the body of God? Which stone are you? Are you the locking stone in a certain point? receiver. You know like this building it has different sections or different portions of the wall. There is a straight wall here but then here there is a window there is a door. So there are some good stones which can look at the door others can maybe be down up different stones. So what value are you to the kingdom of God? Praise the name of the Lord. Just coming to church to be part of the service is not enough. Participate. Show your relevance in the body of Christ. Participate in the activities of the kingdom. Praise the name of our Lord. If you can't testify, PRAY FOR THE one who is testifying. Praise the name of our Lord. If you can't go out, support that one who is going out. If you can't come and help in the work activity, let me put this there. Praise the name of our Lord. If maybe we are having a time of washing the busy, but you know to wash, we don't need only water. Water is not for free. Praise the name of our Lord. say, "I'm not going to be there, but I'm sending some contribution. Let me put let me pay the water bill this month. Let me pay the power bill this month. Let me pay the the streaming bill this month. All those are needs, but they all work together for the good of the body of Jesus. Let me contribute this. let me go and participate in this. PRAISE THE NAME OF LIKE SOME BROTHERS says were going to Toro yesterday, but then there are others who spend time at church yesterday. Make this service work out. Praise the name of our Lord. We all may not be in the same place at the SAME TIME ALL involved into the kingdom. I'm doing this. I'm doing this. I'm also going to find out this. Praise the name of our Lord. That's how we NEED TO WORK AS A BODY. Show your activity in the body of God. Praise the name of our Lord. It's our place. So I find rubbish there. I'm not just going to to kick it, but I'm going to pick it. Put it in the right position. Praise the name of the Lord. You are showing concern. Praise the name of the Lord. You're saying this belongs to me. This is our place. This is our sanctuary. So you see, you do everything you can to make the place better. Praise the name of the Lord. So they picked them from different kingdom stones. But now when it came to the builders, [Music] most of the builders, they were slaves. This these builders should we get builder here. They never had the conviction of the temple that they were building. So now they get a stone. This one looks funny. Let us put this aside. So they continue picking one another, joining them, joining them. Now the chief cornerstone. Praise the name of our Lord. Now you see that these stones were cut by inspiration. God would show those those cutters where to go. Take this dimension. THEY WERE VERY BIG STONES. bigger than our cars, big transport them there. When they reached there, God had to inspire the builders. But now here God made sure that they reject the chief cornerstone and they just threw it in the rubbish pit. It's looking funny. It is not pleasant. And that's how the gospel is rejected. Why do you waste your TIME IN CHURCH? WHY DO YOU WASTE your time praying? Why do you waste time this and this? Is rejected. It becomes a rock of offense. It is a stumbling stone. What can I use this stone for but the Bible say for us who believe it is very precious. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's how God is building his kingdom. Praise the name of our Lord. There are those who are rejecting. There are those who are accepting. Praise the name of our Lord. So now when they reached building the temple, they rejected the right stone. When they reached the end, they found things are not matching somewhere. When they reached the rubbish pit, there was a stone which they must have put at the cornerstone. And the Bible says it was the Lord's doing. Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord had allowed it to happen. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Matthew chapter 21 and then verse 42. The Bible says Jesus said unto them, did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected? The same is become the head of the corner. This is the Lord is doing and it is marvelous in our eyes. Therefore, I say unto you, the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation, bringing forth the fruits thereof. Now he was talking to the Jews because they had rejected him. Then he says the kingdom of God taken from you and given to the Gentiles. They rejected the kingdom. As they rejected stone. So he says okay you have rejected it. It has become a stone of offense. It has become a stumbling stone. Let it turn to those people who receive it. Now we are living in the time. Praise the name of the LORD WHERE THE GENTILES also are rejecting the stone. Praise the name of the Lord. We are living in a time where the gospel is laughed at. People don't want IT ANYMORE LIKE YOU GO TO TOWN OR YOU START TESTIFYING OR YOU PREACH THE GOSPEL, NOBODY WANT to listen TO YOU. BUT LET SOMEBODY WHO COMES WITH SOME trickster this one IS CORRECT. THIS ONE &gt;&gt; ALL THE PEOPLE WILL COLLECT there and even block the road. They don't want the gospel ANYMORE BUT THEY WANT things of deception. YOU GO AND START PUTTING THE WORD OF GOD. PUT THE WORD OF GOD. NOBODY WILL come there. If I let a politician come and just say a crowd, it is now a stone of offense. NO MORE WANT NOBODY WANTS TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. They have rejected the stone. So we are living in a time WHERE THE GOSPEL IS going back to the Jews. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he says in verse 44, WHATSOEVER SHALL FALL ON this stone shall be broken. But whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. Praise the name of our Lord. So this time we're living in, let Christ be a precious stone to us. precious. And when you have something precious, you think about it. Praise the name of our Lord. You care about it. Blessed be the name of our Lord because it is precious. Praise the name of our Lord. And that should be our love to God him all the time. He's so precious to you. You desire to be with him. You desire to live with him. Praise the name of our Lord. You don't only think about him only on Sunday. You don't think about him when you have problems, but even in your free time, in your busy time, praise the name of the Lord. Like I believe our brother Adonai Adonai whatever time he has you know whether he's too busy if he sees a call from patience he wants to excuse himself on anything precious praise the name of because there's that love that desire and that should be our LORD JESUS YOU'RE NOT TOO BUSY to pray. You're not too busy to read your word. You're not too busy to hear the word. So precious. Praise the name of our Lord. You are in great expectation. If he comes in THE MORNING, YOU'LL FIND ME READY. If he comes in the afternoon ready come at night, you'll make find me ready. AND THAT'S WHERE THE BIBLE PUTS IT. TWO WERE IN THE field working in the morning. One was ready. Two were preparing a meal day. One was ready. Two were resting at night. One was ready. Second. That should be the way we live our lives. You know in that kind of you know continuous communion. You continuously commune with him. Every day is not far from you. You are talking with him. You are hearing him speaking. You are praising him. You are testifying about him. That's how Christ should be to us. A precious stone, not a stumbling stone. Praise the name of our Lord. When you hear his word, you should rejoice your heart. It will make you happy and say, "Lord, I'm thankful. LORD, I'VE HEARD WHAT you've told. IF YOU FIND YOU ARE MISSING SOMETHING, LORD, HELP ME IN THIS AREA. I WANT TO DO BETTER THAN WHAT I've been told. That's how you respond. Don't say I don't no longer want those kind. I don't want this kind of this thing is just offending me. This thing is just putting me down. The Bible says, "Praise the name of that stone will crush &gt;&gt; to ashes. Nothing. But to us who ARE REDEEMED OF THE ROCK, it's the rock that we stand upon. My faith is built upon the sorrow. Praise the name of our Lord. On Christ, the solid rock I stand. Praise the name of the Lord. All other foundation sinking sand. Why? Because you've got the revelation of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to the book of Romans. Let us start from the book of Luke chapter 21 and then verse 24. The Bible says, "And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations, and Jerusalem shall be trodden down in the gent of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. Praise the name of the Lord. Now we are living in the times where the gentile days are numbered. They are being fulfilled. And God gave us this season. of the seven church ages to get a bride for his name's sake. And we are living in the Ludician church age at the end of time where the Lord Jesus Christ will come and take his bride. Praise the name of our Lord. Now as we are living at this time a junction of time there are many things that are happening. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now we are living in a time where the religions are uniting and everything will have to fulfill the prophecy. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in Revelations 13:1, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; Revelations 13 and verse one, and I stood upon the sand of sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and 10 horns, and upon his horns 10 crowns, and upon his heads the name of Baram. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority. Now you see that the Bible says he saw a beast rise up out of the sea and sea &gt;&gt; means water and water means people. Praise the name of our Lord. In Revelations chapter 17 and then verse 15, he says, "The waters which you saw were where there was cities are the peoples and the multitudes and nations and tongues. And then you see that still in Revelation 17:1 and there came seven angels which had the seven vows and talked with me saying unto me, come he and I will show you the the great judgment. of the great war that siteth upon many waters. That means that there are others who come from her being a great war. The Bible says in verse five, "And upon our forehead was a name written, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth." She's the great one. She sits upon many waters. She sits upon many people. In other words, she's composed of people. &gt;&gt; You know, tongues, nations, &gt;&gt; you know, tribes, kingdoms. That means that she's all over the world. It is a religious system that opposes God, that opposes the word of God. this religious system is a mother of her lot. Other denominations have come out of her. So she says I'm the mother church. So from her proceeds others and then the Bible says she's mystery Babylon. Praise the name of our Lord. NOW WE NOTICE here that in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, he was the king of Babylon. And what did Nebuchadnezzar do on worship? He introduced an image to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. He introduced an image to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says he put the image of Daniel &gt;&gt; because Daniel &gt;&gt; was given a name of his God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of OUR LORD. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE Daniel was not forced to worship it but it was his fellows Shadrach and Abenego who were worship for forced to worship the image of Daniel. SO NOW UNDER BABYLON THEY PUT an image of a holy man as a worship. And even under the great war they get THE IMAGES OF HOLY PEOPLE WORSHIP. You get others the images in the neck they worship them. Like during these examinations, many of these students, they had those images on their tables when they were doing examinations. Pray for us image on the tables when they're doing examination. Maybe when they forget they look at the image but the image is dumb. It can't walk by itself where then you start carrying it on your back. You put it on your neck, put it on your armor, put it in your sitting, you go and give it gifts, it will not take. They will even ro from there. You give it flowers, they will dry from there. Praise the name of our Lord. So you notice that in the days of Babylon, NEBUCHADNEZZAR put the image of a holy person and they forced them to worship. Even now in the end time under the relig under the union of religions you know they are coming together to force the world to worship not God but something else. And we also see that at the beginning of Babel praise the name of our Lord there was Nimrod the mighty hand. He was a mighty hunter before God. He was hunting souls of men who are failing refusing to worship his image. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to this message in the pagan church age [Music] page 187 82 and then paragraph one. Babel is the original for Babylon. &gt;&gt; It means confusion. It was literally started by Kosh. the son of h but was brought to a kingdom of power and grandeur under his son Nimrod the mighty hunter. Nimrod according to Genesis 11 and also according to history he set out to accomplish three things. He wanted to build a strong nation. He did that. He wanted propagate his own religion. He did it. He wanted to make a name for himself. He also accomplished it. His accomplishments were so monumental that the kingdom of Babylon was called the head of God. among all the world governments. that his religion gained prominence is proven by the fact that the scriptures that it it that that identifies it with Satan completely in Isaiah chapter 14 and in Revelations chapter 17 and 18 and by history. We can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatory and the theme of myology. [Music] Though &gt;&gt; the names of the gods differ in different sections of the land according to the language of the people. So you see the spirit under the mystery Babylon and then it comes to the the time of Nebuchadnezzar and then we track it in the time of Nimrod. Nimrod was the first person to make people start worshiping another god. Cain &gt;&gt; was worshiping the same God with Abbe but now Nimrod with his religion his own establishment. So you see that Babylon Babel confusion then he comes to Babylon the times of Nebuchadnezzar under mystery Babylon. It is a religious system and has to bring the world together to worship the beast. That's what the Bible say. Worship the beast. AND NOW THE BIBLE IS TELLING US in Revelations 17 that this great war she sits on a scarlet colored beast. And the BEAST ACCORDING TO THE Bible in Revelations 13 and verse 18 here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man. The beast is a man. Praise the name of Allah. The beast THAT BROUGHT THE FALL IN THE GARDEN OF Eden was a serpent. But now, praise the name OF OUR LORD. THE SERPENT IS seen beings. So the beast that CAUSES THE FALL OF THE WHOLE world is a man, religious man. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says &gt;&gt; in verse three, "Let no man deceive you by any means, for that they shall not come except there be a falling away fast and the man of sin be revealed, the son of pition. who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, all that is worshiped, so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. He says he's a man of sin. So the beast is a man and that beast leads a religious system. The great war sits on that beast and then the beast moves here, moves here, moves here and then the moves and the war also sits among many people and then they all go where the beast tells them to go. Praise the name of our Lord. Now at this end time, the Bible says that this beast, let us go back. Revelations 13:2. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority. &gt;&gt; Verse two, two Now this dragon in Revelations 12 and verse 9 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceives the whole world. He was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him. So the Bible told us that the great the dragon Satan &gt;&gt; gave this beast &gt;&gt; his seat. great authority &gt;&gt; and great power. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So the the beast, &gt;&gt; you know, was Satan incarnate, &gt;&gt; Satan was in this beast, &gt;&gt; the way Satan was in the serpent. &gt;&gt; So now Satan gets into this beast. &gt;&gt; The way Satan ENTERED JUDAS'S CAROTION, LIKE LAST TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SATAN entered Judas. Now at this end time, Satan enters a religious man and causes the whole world to WORSHIP HIM. HE CALLS HIMSELF holy father. But in THE SCRIPTURES, THERE IS NOBODY WHO WAS CALLED A HOLY father other than God Almighty. In John chapter 17, &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; In John chapter 17 &gt;&gt; and then verse 11. &gt;&gt; And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. And I come unto thee, holy father, keep through thy own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one as we are. John 17:11 Praise the name of our Lord. A title that belongs to God. Now the man says I'm the one. Then says he sits in the temple of God. I am God. Worship me. I'm the holy father. Now the Bible says Satan &gt;&gt; gives him his power, &gt;&gt; his seat &gt;&gt; and great authority. Now you SEE THAT IN ISAIAH CHAPTER 14, Satan wanted to be worshiped. So he finally fulfills it at the end time where the world worships him as God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Because the Bible says if you don't worship him, you are going to be killed. Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us continue in Revelations chapter 13. Revelations chapter 13 &gt;&gt; and then we read &gt;&gt; verse four and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him. verse eight. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life slain from the foundation of the world. Praise the name of our Lord. Now we are living in a time where the Bible says another beast came up out of the earth. Verse 11. And I beheld another beast coming out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon. [Music] Now, brother Brandham teaches us that this beast that came out of the earth which had two horns like a lamb that is religious power and then and then another one praise the name of our Lord speaking like a dragon. So it had this religious power, civil power, &gt;&gt; the USA. &gt;&gt; So now it causes the world to make a union of religions and the union of religions becomes the image of the beast. AND THEN THE BIBLE SAYS, "Whosoever does not worship the image of the beast shall be killed in verse 15." Verse 15. &gt;&gt; 13:14. &gt;&gt; 13:15. [Music] And he causes all both great, small, rich, poor, free, bonded to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead. that no man might buy or sell. Save he that has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. Praise the name of our Lord. Now the the mark in the forehead is your believing what they teach. &gt;&gt; Believe in the trinity. You already have the forehead mark. They are teaching. You may not be collecting with them. But you believe the mark is there in the right hand fellowship. Praise the name of our Lord. You know we have taken long without having overnight. We have them every day. &gt;&gt; We don't have them. &gt;&gt; We don't have even lunch hour. &gt;&gt; Let me go there and have lunch hour. &gt;&gt; Right hand. You accept your fellowship. You know, you you link up with them. So you get the mark. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now you will see that all the kingdoms which were there Babylonian kingdom then the Persian kingdom and the Greek kingdom all their attributes they wind up in the Roman Empire. Praise the name of the Lord. All those things whatever they were doing, they wind up here. And then the Bible says in Revelations 13:2 that this beast I saw was like a low party. And when you go in the scriptures here Daniel chapter 7, you'll find Daniel chapter 7 describes the four gentile kingdoms. You see THAT THE SPIRITS COME FROM there and then they wind up in the in the beast of the end time. So you see that in Daniel 7 verse 6 I beheld and another beast like a leopard. which was the Greek kingdom. So the spirits wind up here. And then he says his feet just now interpret as I read where as the feet of the bear. [Music] So now you go to Daniel chapter 7 verse 5. He says another beast, the second one like a bear. So the spirits which were in the med persian kingdom they end up here with this. [Music] Then he says and his mouth as a mouth of a lion. You go back to Daniel chapter 7 verse 4. The first beast was like a lion. So all those spirits they wind up here at the end time. And then when the Lord Jesus comes and the stone cut without hands might the image all its components are destroyed. Praise the name of we are living at the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus. So we need to see that we prepare ourselves. Praise the name of our Lord. You see what's happening already in the world. Praise the name of our Lord. The union of religion. You know the chaos in Middle East and all the things that are taking PLACE THEY ARE SHOWING us time is no longer. Praise the name of our Lord. This is the time we need to see that we prepare for the change of our body. It's the time YOU NEED TO CHECK your your vessel oil. Praise the name of our Lord. And if you really HAVE OIL, YOUR LOVE SHOULD BE BURNING. The life of Christ should BE MANIFESTED. THAT'S THE LIGHT OF the world. In the darkness at places of show them a true Christian. Praise the name of our Lord. In the community where you live, you show them I'm a TRUE CHRISTIAN. SO YOUR LAMP is shining. And when we come to church here, we have come for a refilling. Praise the name of our Lord. We've come to refill OUR LOVE. LORD, FILL me more. Let my cup run over. Praise the name of our Lord. So you OPEN UP ALL YOUR HEART. FILL ME LORD. PRAISE THE NAME OF LORD. EVERY PART IN ME FEEL IT. MY MIND IS ON CHRIST. MY WORDS ARE TALKING about Christ. My walk is about Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Filled with the Holy Spirit. SO TO US, PRAISE the name of our Lord. He is a precious stone. Praise the name of our Lord to the kingdoms of the world. HAVING AS A STONE CUT OUT OF WITHOUT earth to destroy all the gentile kingdom. Praise the name of our Lord. We are living at the time where we need to see the change of our body. Praise the name of our Lord. See that you take it serious. Have a personal relationship with God. Let him be precious to you. Worshiping him all the time. Living a life that is holy. at your place of work. Don't put it off at your home. See that you live a life that is worthy of the gospel. Praise the name of our Lord. What a day that we are living. Praise the name of our Lord. All these things are being fulfilled before. Blessed be the name of our Lord. So you need to see that you are filled with the oil. And it's not difficult. The oil is already here. Praise the name of our Lord. You just keep on receiving more. Lord, fill me. Lord, change me. Lord, transform me. Praise the name of our Lord. Let Christ be a precious stone to not wait to be a crushing stone. Let him be a stone, precious, adored, lovely.
