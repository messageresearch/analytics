I'm the assistant assistant pastor [Applause] excuse me for taking Liberty does that mean does that mean I get a paycheck do I get a paycheck now a paycheck a payroll our pay is on the other side Bible says store not up Treasures on this Earth but store up Treasures in Heaven the work that is going on in Uganda there is much treasure being stored up in [Music] heaven you might not have much here in your country but don't worry based on what I see based on what I see you are very rich on the other [Applause] [Music] side amen I bring you greetings from the Saints in Canada brother Ed

God's doing doing in Uganda I'm 100% behind [Applause] you brother Tom texted me the other [Music] day he said brother Tim I'm 100% behind you that means that he's 100% behind you and we thank God for all for every soul that has been won in these last few years we have one purpose to find the last predestinated seed because this world is not our home we're but we're just passing through we come from God we go back to God Amen we were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world we are manifested in this Dimension but this Dimension is temporary we have come to the hour when time will be no more we're going to an eternal realm and I'll say more than that we are anchored in an eternal realm that's what I want to speak on this morning I want to speak on the priesthood of the Eternal the priesthood of the Eternal let's take our Bibles and turn to Exodus chapter [Music] 40 the last chapter of the book of Exodus just before we read let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father once more we want to commit ourselves into your hands realizing that the words of human Minds will [Music] fail but you alone have the words of eternal life those are the words we are interested in this morning Eternal words powerful words transforming words Lord may your word be ever powerful this morning take away every opposition to your word oh [Music] god father bring us into one mind and one Accord we give we give this service to you for For Your Glory anoint the speaker and the hearer in Jesus Christ's name amen Exodus 40 and verse one and the Lord and the Lord spake unto Moses [Music] saying on the first day of the first month Thou shalt set up the Tabernacle of the tent of the congregation [Music] and thou shalt put therein the Ark of the testimony and cover the ark with the [Music] veil and th and thou shalt bring in the table and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it and thou shalt bring in the Candlestick and light the the lamps [Music] thereof and thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the Ark of the testimony and put the hanging of the door to the Tabernacle [Music] and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the Tabernacle of the tent of the congregation and thou shalt set the labor before the tent of the congregation and the Altar and thou shall put water therein and thou shalt set up the court round about and hang up the hanging at the court gate amen the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may have your [Music] seats now God was doing something that Israel had never seen But Moses saw it before he saw it in heaven amen it was a pattern that was shown him in in heaven and God said you'll set this up in Israel and when Israel had come out of Egypt they were just a mob of people just everybody moving Any Which Way but now when Moses had the pattern in Heaven he began to set up the Tabernacle outside the camp it was a representation of something you see the dwelling place of God was to be outside the [Music] camp Jesus suffered outside the camp Paul says let us go unto him outside the camp but there's another group of people that have come through seven Church ages and they are put in order outside the camp you are that people Moses saw it in heaven Israel saw it set up in the wilderness the Jews saw the dwelling place of God at Calvary not the temple in Jerusalem Jesus said destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up he wasn't speaking of herod's Temple temple herod's Temple but he was speaking of the temple of God that he was but you are the temple of God and I'm looking at what Israel was looking at I'm looking at what uh Moses was looking at I'm looking at the Temple of the Holy Ghost are you the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen do you have those slides who's who's operating the slides over here let me just put it in a picture for you all right now when Moses set up the the Tabernacle the the reason he did it outside the [Music] camp was that he was going to set the tribes in order around the Tabernacle because on each side there would be four symbols one symbol on each side this is what he saw in heaven a lion an ox a man and an [Music] eagle give me the next slide so they had emblems of each [Music] tribe and four of the tribes corresponded with what Moses saw in heaven so he knew exactly where to place them next slide we'll just zoom in a little bit here into this Tabernacle in the center of it all was the tabernacle The Dwelling Place of God and next one and in this Tabernacle was Set uh uh vessels of ministration now over here we have the holy of holies in which was the Ark of the Covenant The Mercy Seat the cherubims between which dwelt the Shina glory and no one was to go in there except the high priest once a year and not without blood and then in the Next Room we have the table of showbread and the Candlestick and the altar of incense and I want you to notice something about this this was gold and this was gold gold but out here it was it was brass what is showing us is this room was pointing towards this room it was not pointing towards the outer it was pointing towards the holy of holies it was taking its order from the holy of holies now what was Moses doing here why did God have this order for Israel because Moses was taking what he was shown in heaven and putting it in action upon the Earth and by doing that he was making Israel an invincible [Music] Army I want you to catch this now without this order they were just a rabble of people that was subject to the elements of the people subject to the enemies but with God dwelling in their midst they are an invincible Army now brother bam says in the church age book he says remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of [Music] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm powerless and formal [Music] The Book of Revelation exposes Satan revealing his works right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of [Music] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what happened to my Tabernacle and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army so it's speaking about Revelation in the church that's what this was to Israel it was a revelation it was a type it was foreshadowing you because the three courts the holy of holies the holy place the outer Court represented the believer the soul the spirit and the [Music] body next slide is there our next one I think we went back to the beginning oh somehow there we go all right next one that's the soulle realm next one now oh where' we go we'll get it technology isn't it wonderful amen now in the soul is where God was meant to dwell in the soul is where God was meant to [Music] dwell now you would think once God dwell in the soul that that would be all there was to it it's a house for God and the cloud overshadowed it where the where the Ark of the Covenant was in there was the shakina of Glory if God is there if God is there what else do we need all right let me take a step into your Tabernacle if you are born again what else do you need if God dwells in your soul that finishes it right we're sealed to the day of our Redemption there's no more work to do but that's not what the Tabernacle showed us there was a holy Place representing your spirit and in there priests were to go every day amen there was a Ministry that was to be done before the Lord every [Music] day if that's so in in the Tabernacle that's so in you amen so we want to look at that today thank you back in the Garden of Eden something thing that man could have an Earthly existence but he could not enter into the Eternal a chair of with a flaming sword was put before the way of the Tree of Life less man would take of the tree of life and live forever he was cut off from the Eternal but when Jesus died at Calvary the veil before the holy of [Music] holies was rent from the top to the bottom showing that man could enter again into the holy of holies [Music] man could enter into the Tree of Life man could enter into the Eternal but when we look at it with those words it seems like we're going somewhere I'm entering into the Eternal but that's not really what's happening is that God has a dwelling place and his dwelling place is in the heart of man and the sacrifice at Calvary opened up the way for the Holy Spirit to take up his Dwelling Place God coming to his [Music] Tabernacle amen first Corinthians chapter 3 it says it this way in verse 16 know ye not that you are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are amen you are the temple of God then over in chapter six he says it this way what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost [Music] which which you have God you are not your own amen we're in verse 19 thank you you are not your own it says you are not your own amen next verse for you are bought with a price [Music] let me put it this way you are the real estate of God real estate property you go and buy a place in the city you build a house why you want to dwell there you bought it it's yours you have every right to dwell there and God purchased you at Calvary Hallelujah he bought you with a price you are not your own therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which for which are God here we go now he didn't just say glorify God in your soul when God takes up residence in your soul are you with me he owns your spirit he owns your body wherefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit if you have received God in your soul he owns you Soul spirit and body Hallelujah we were born in sin but we were meant to be the dwelling place of God [Music] you might have been the trash heap of the world but God bought you so he could dwell there Hallelujah he comes in and cleans out the trash he doesn't dwell amongst trash he dwells in the soul Realm and the fire of God comes down and burns out every evil nature gives you a new spirit gives you a new heart so that then he can give you his Spirit your amen God is Not only a real estate owner he's a real estate developer he's developing in us the greatest development the world has ever seen Hallelujah Isaiah 66 Isaiah 66 uh isah verse one says thus sayith the Lord the the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that you build me and where is the place of my rest for all those things has my hand made and all those things have been sayith the Lord but to this man will I look even to him that is of a poor and a contrite [Music] spirit and trembleth at my word who was that man it was Jesus Christ the firstborn among many Brethren Jesus said in Matthew 11 verse 29 says take my yoke upon [Music] you and learn of me for I am meek and L in heart and you shall find rest unto your [Music] soul amen the unbeliever is restless in his [Music] soul if he's a seed of God there's something calling out there's a deep calling because he was made to be a Dwelling Place of God and Jesus came in whom God dwelt in his fullness to show the pattern of God's Tabernacle that's why he could say destroy this Temple this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up he was telling them I am the temple of God and I'm the firstborn among many Brethren and Paul's telling you you are the Temple of the Holy Spirit you're after the same pattern amen amen so so the scripture says let this mind that was in Christ be in you that's not just some vague idea the mind the spirit the thought processes the mind that was in Christ he didn't just say the soul that was in Christ but he said the mind that was in Christ he didn't just say the holy of holies but there's another room that requires daily ministration your spirit realm where your mind is where is the greatest battle ever fought where it's bombarded from the outer court but it's made to be in the image of Christ that's why the holy of holies was [Music] gold and the holy place was gold and all the instruments was gold the table of showbread was gold the altar of incense was gold the Candlestick was solid gold let everything in that mind realm be deity Hallelujah let your let your thought process be nothing but the thoughts of God it was not part gold part gold and part silver and part brass and part wood and part this and part that [Music] if you stood in that room everywhere you turned it was gold Hallelujah let this mind which was in Christ be in you who thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation [Music] and took on him the form of a servant and and was made in the likeness of men now what is Paul describing here in his thoughts he was equal with God but on the outside was Badger skins he was made in the likeness of man Amen on the outside was an altar of sacrifice a lab made of brass not gold judgment not deity that's what brass represents judgment so when people looked at Jesus there was no beauty that they should desire when people looked at this Tabernacle from the [Music] outside there was no Beauty to it when people look at you from the outside there's no Beauty to it nothing special about you but inside it's de inside it's all gold inside it's meant to be just [Music] God hallelujah but you know what there's daily [Music] ministration there's things that you need to do every day to keep the spirit in order in the soul [Music] realm in the holy of holies where the Shina dwells all right in there there's no daily ministration why because you're sealed to the day of your [Music] redemption in the soul realm there's no anxiety no worries there's no complexes there's no nervousness there's no nervousness there's no bitterness I'm glad my interpreter doesn't even know these words he doesn't struggle against the but some people [Music] do in the soul realm there's no Strife in the soul realm there's no envying my he's an amazing man [Laughter] praise the Lord you see the Bible says in the word there is none of these things but now though we walk in the flesh 2 Corinthians 10 and verse three we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're not fleshly but Mighty through God to the pulling down of [Music] strongholds what kind of strongholds physical strongholds no spiritual strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into [Music] captivity every thought every thought [Music] every thought to The Obedience of [Music] Christ there's a work in your life where the holy spirit in the soul [Music] realm must have the preeminence in your spirit [Music] realm that the thoughts of Christ might be preeminent because the devil also puts his thoughts there but we are to bring all those into captivity to The Obedience of Christ the word specifically the anointed word for your day [Music] amen now let's look at the difference here are you still with me okay now in the outer [Music] realm like the outer Court in the Tabernacle Aaron he had a rod in that Rod that he used to walk with he would walk through the outer court maybe he would even come into the holy place and he had this Rod it was a nice Rod it was made of an almond tree and you know if he would have taken the tree of knowledge he did if he would have taken the tree of [Music] knowledge maybe he could have put that rod in the ground and water it and then fertilize it and keep it wet and maybe over time in the right circumstances he might see a little bud come from that rock it might take years but if life started to come then it would grow into a tree and it would eventually leaf and then it would bud or it would flower and then he would get almond from but they had a dispute in Israel and Moses said let everybody bring their rod into the holy of holies everybody who thinks they should be the high priest and he put them in the holy of holies and in one day Aaron's rod buted put forth flowers put forth fruit all in one day why because in that place is eternity and in eternity there's no yesterday and there's no tomorrow there's no next month there's no next year there's no sometime in eternity it's always today Hallelujah in eternity everything in that realm was life Hallelujah when they put the Mana in there Mana that God said don't keep it more than one [Music] day and if they kept if they kept it overnight it would rot and it would get maggots and it would spoil they were taught it only last for one day but in eternity in the Eternal there's no yesterday and there's no tomorrow so the Mana which was for today it's all is today so the manner could not go back in the presence of the Eternal Hallelujah that's the realm we are connected to when God births you by the Holy Spirit he has connected you to Eternity Paul says we are anchored Beyond the Veil that's why in your soul where the Holy Ghost dwells there is unlimited power power to speak worlds into existence amen that's the kind of power that dwells in you but is subject to a law and that law is faith in your spirit there must be Faith because faith is tied to the Eternal I'll go into that tonight sorry I'll go into that in the next but I want us to catch here you're not just a Eternal creature in [Music] idea you are an actual possessor of Eternity within your soul and the Tabernacle [Music] the Tabernacle was showing us our Spirits must point to the Eternal not to the temporal or our thoughts must point to the Eternal not to the temporal what did Jesus say take no thought for for what for tomorrow for tomorrow for sufficient unto the day now if you're not going to think about tomorrow you're thinking Eternal thoughts because in eternity There's No Tomorrow amen amen he says take no thought for what you would drink or eat or be [Music] cloth don't let your thoughts be consumed with the outward Hallelujah give me the next scripture behold the fowls of the air they sow not neither do they reap but your heavenly father feeds them and aren't you better than they Jesus said consider the lies yes they neither toil nor spend but Solomon in all of his glory was not a r as one of [Music] these Solomon in all of his wisdom in all of his wealth could never be as pretty as a lily think Eternal thoughts it's a daily battle it's a it's a constant battle there's no days off he can't say Sunday's my day off the devil never bothers me on Sunday amen is that right no no the Devil comes after you on Sunday matter of fact he came to church this morning because he wants to distract you [Music] from cuz he hates revelation he doesn't want you to know who you are because then you'd be an invincible Army so what he does he can't stop you from being born again once you're born again you're sealed to the day of your Redemption but where is the attack on the believer in the mind realm in the attitude because the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise will bring it to pass it's when you have the new birth you have enough power to create but it's the mental attitude that makes the believer powerless but the anointing that God sends in each age is sent to combat the devil in your thoughts do in your thought combat the devil in your thoughts amen it's a daily battle that's why there's a daily [Music] ministration let this let this mind that was in Christ [Music] Jesus so now Ephesians 4 and6 says it this way says be careful for nothing that is to say be worried about nothing Philippians I sorry did I say Ephesians Philippians 4 and 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known known unto God daily prayer and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ [Music] Jesus not just your hearts not just the heart but your minds also finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely with whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virt if there be any praise these things are Eternal think on these things [Music] [Music] [Applause] all right now there there's three types of [Music] ministration first is the table of showbread 12 loaves representing the 12 tribes of [Music] Israel a type of the Mana but this bread only the priests could eat this bread wasn't for everybody it's represented it's representing seven Church [Music] ages as it is made fresh every seven days the showbread represents faith in the word for your [Music] day brother Bram says you're living in his presence eating the showbread that's only provided that day for believers priest only so then it's only for those that are born again amen it's only for the born again all right so it's not for the unbeliever he has made you Kings and Priests so there's a daily feeding upon the word and you have been sent a special portion for your age Hallelujah let me go a little bit further he says the sh of Glory manifests him it brings forth the Word of Promise right out to [Music] you Jesus this is in the unveiling of God he says that's the reason he had to Veil Moses [Music] face because in him was the word he veiled Jesus as a humble little man to keep them from seeing Jehovah oh my how we should have SE how Israel should have seen it they should have recognized why did they Veil Moses they built he built a tabernacle and God dwelt behind the veil and then Moses come out from the presence of God and his face sha and they had to Veil Moses it was showing that man was meant to be the dwelling place of God [Music] the veil on the Tabernacle was only a type the veil on Moses was showing the real dwelling place is man and Jesus was veiled as a humble little man and then brother brandham says he veils himself today in Earth and vessels with the Shina the shakina is dwelling in you but it's veiled to the world he says the outside looks like a bunch of Holy Rollers he says old Badger skins but the inside hides the shikina glory now listen closely and it ripens the showbread that we feed on ripens ripens [Music] what is he saying the word comes into your mind you feed on it because you're a priest and the power of God within you brings that to maturity you might only understand a little bit today but keep walking with God keep thoughts on the Eternal until the word that you're feeding on becomes ripen to you personally and you can see yourself in the world [Applause] hallelujah mean the bread doesn't make you a priest you it is for those that are called priests the message doesn't make you a Believer it is for the [Applause] predestinated you always were a believer and one day the word came by your way and it proved you were a Believer it proved you're a Son of God provve you're a daughter of God As I said yesterday you didn't gain representation by believing you believe because you already had representation in the mind of God hallelujah [Music] for praise the Lord I wish I spoke your language sounds better in your language than in mine see he was The Rock in the wilderness he was the Mana that came down from heaven [Music] he was a showbread in the temple and the reason brother Brown says we can't have faith is because we don't know who he [Music] is he's the showbread on the table he's the message to every age and he comes to you to show you you're a part of him and as brother brandham says we just need to lay in the presence of the [Music] son and let these things ripen in our lives that's the reason the veil was rent in the [Music] temple that kind of Glory could come into you to ripen the word for your age bring you into relationship he says brother brandham says in the Rapture what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the [Music] bride that's why when the angel said to John take the book and eat the book it wasn't a leather book it was Christ The Living bread of life and when you eat him you become like [Music] him let's move on to the Candlestick remember daily Ministry if the priest was in the Holy place and got hungry he had every right to take a piece of the bread from the table [Music] and eat it it was his place brother BR says why do you hunger why do you thirst it's God trying to get these mystery truths to [Music] you then he says but you let your pastor you let your Church you let your teaching take it out of you what's he talking about the Mind realm is out of order there's too many thoughts that are contrary to the word you're hungering you're thirsting but there's no showbread on the the [Applause] table oh we need to put the message on our table every [Music] day feeding on the word to satisfy the hunger within [Music] us amen Candlestick now we know that the seven golden candlesticks represent the seven Church [Music] ages Revelation chapter 1 tells us that and so let me just read it the way brother brandham said it he says what is a Candlestick it's a lamp stand notice how beautiful here he saw this one like the son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden [Music] lampstands which means seven Church ages each pipe or lamp stem hooked into the main big oil [Music] sensor are which are and they and the come down into the oil they poured oil in the top and the lamp with the wick hanging down kept burning day and night you never had to light it you just keep pouring oil into [Music] it all right am now he says well let's just leave that quote there now how appropriate it is to see the lamp and the wick and the oil o how [Music] appropriate all right now we see more than a lamp and a wick and an oil there's one more thing Fire Light so there's four things all right the oil represents the Holy Ghost the lamp represents the age the fire represents the [Music] experience but now the wick is [Music] you you see you've got to be you've got to be living in the oil there's one baptisms but there's many feelings and the experiences of our life is represented in the fire in the age that living in but now I want to talk about the wick for a minute because the wick was the only thing that would cause a problem because after it would burn for a while the wick would get carboned up it would get deposits of old burnt up Wick [Music] and that needed to be trimmed off because if you didn't trim it then it would cause the light to dim down and it would call cause the lamp to smoke see what are you saying brother Tim there's things in your life you need to keep trimmed off you know in the last days the cry went out behold the bridegroom comes rise and trim your [Music] lamps what are you trimming oh listen Saints what is that carbon it is yesterday's [Music] burning you can't live on yesterday's burning you can't live on what God did yesterday you can't live on Luther Wesley or [Music] Pentecost you've got to come into the experience of this [Music] day if you don't oh it'll still burn but it'll be Smokey it'll be dim it won't be the full brightness of the word it was a good burning in those days it was bright in those days but we are called to walk in the brightness of this hour amen and now let me go a little bit personal here because this is the light that's burning in the Holy place or the mind [Music] have you ever seen someone that's a good brother or a good sister and they're just downcast you know they're born again but they just seem don't seem to have that spark anymore the pressures of Life have got to them you see that what has happen is the wick has got carboned up and the full effect of the oil can't have its preeminence in their [Music] lives you need to trim the lamp it it's you you need to trim the lamb don't rely on what happened yesterday you need a fresh daily experience with [Music] God hallelujah if you're downcast this morning you need to say Lord trim my lamp if you're fearful this morning Lord trim my L amen if there's something troubling you in your mind this morning the Bible says an eternal thought is not worried about anything but if you're worried about something this morning you need to say Lord trim my lamp this morning take away every doubt take away every fear take away every wrong thought because when you trim away all those things now your thoughts are getting into the mind of Christ now you're getting into relationship with God the way he wants it let this mind that was in Christ Jesus Hallelujah me me listen I'm going to drop this in now when brother brandham had a prayer line he'd stand before the person he says we we have here like the Jesus and the woman at the well except in this case it's a man and he says now I don't know what her problem is but what I'm doing is what Jesus did to the woman at [Music] the I'm trying to contact her spirit because to find out what's wrong with her listen what's wrong with the person is in their Spirit many times you say now I see you're a Christian now if they're a Christian the power of Divine Healing is already in them the power of Deliverance is within them but there's something in their Spirit that's hindering the power of God from moving in their [Music] lives see that's why we have to bring every thought into captivity to the [Music] word sometimes brother Brandon would say oh you you had a lie told about you it wounded you in your [Music] spirit somebody said you had a devil but you don't have a devil you're a Believer now just a minute here if there were a believer believer why were they bothered it was it was something in their mind because somebody said something to them that was [Music] wrong because and then the devil anointed that to to get them into the wrong attitude to make them powerless come on Saints this is spiritual stuff this morning this is the realities of a Christian battle the word of God the prophet comes to change the thoughts in the mind because if he can get her to believe him who is he he's the word of the hour if he can get her to believe him nothing will stand at his [Applause] prayer believing is in the mind faith faith is in the soul but believing is in the mind it's what you do with the faith you believe with the faith that you have Jesus came to the man that have an eptic child and the man said Lord your disciples couldn't do anything for myself he says please can you do something and Jesus says I can if you believe and he said then he says in the King James Lord I believe help thou my unbelief now what is he saying he's saying Lord I believe but help my lack of faith because faith is a substance faith is a revelation faith comes by hearing the word so the man was looking Ates Jesus he was believing with every bit of Faith he had the problem is he didn't have enough faith and that's many people's problem it's not that they're not believing they're believing but they haven't been feeding on the showbread because faith comes by the showbread faith comes by the anointed word of the hour Revelation upon Revelation upon Revelation that brings our minds subject to the word of God that we can see the word the way God sees it and we can see ourselves the way God sees us let the word of God bring into captivity if you have a single thing that disagrees with God's word in your mind you are powerless but may the Holy Spirit bring that into [Music] captivity to lose the power of God in your [Music] life listen church this is not skin milk this morning this is for Sons and Daughters of God who want to live as sons and daughters all right uhuh now let's go to the altar of incense now if this was the tabernacle and that was the outer Court and this was the Holy place and this was the holy of holies there would be a veil here and there would be an altar of incense right [Music] here so when the priest came to offer [Music] incense he was not facing the people he was facing eternity he was showing us where our prayers should be directed because incense represents our prayers and what lays beyond that Veil what lays in that room is the Shina Glory the priest would be here facing this way by faith offering incense to the God that he believed dwell [Music] there what dwelled there he didn't know that God like you know him what dwell there was the Eternal God what dwell there was the logos what dwell there was the Lamb's Book of Life what dwelt there was [Music] melchisedec listen folks this is what brother how brother Bram ties it together the priest doesn't understand it but now in this day you've been called to walk by Perfect [Music] Faith as Jesus walked by Perfect faith in what the word said he was so also you are to walk by Perfect faith in what the word says you [Music] are not what the outer Court says you are [Applause] Hallelujah in the outer Court Jesus was the son of Joseph a carpenter son that's all they could see no beauty that they should desire but the reality is he was the King of Kings and the Lord of lords [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah he was of Glory dwelling in a body of Flesh and that same sh kind of Glory came back in the day of Pentecost and divided itself licks of fire upon each one that they could be born again God dwelling in them God taking up his residence in every Tabernacle in this Tabernacle in this Tabernacle in this Tabernacle amen hallelujah so now the daily Ministry of prayer we have to be careful because now we're approaching the altar of incense Zariah approached the offer of incense and he and he was offering incense for the prayers of the people in the outer court and an angel appeared where not in eternity but in the mind all right and Zachariah hears the voice of the Angel the angel says you're going to have a son and and he'll be the Forerunner and zachari says how shall these things in other words it's impossible my wife and I are Barren there's no possibility and the angel said it's going to happen [Music] anyway but because you doubt it there will be a consequence for your doubt oh learn the lesson of the word [Music] oh doubt cannot stop the purpose of God [Applause] hallelujah but there are consequences for doubt what was Zachariah doubting he wasn't doubting God he was doubting himself say it again he was doubting himself it's not possible I know what I am I look at myself from the outer Corner that's why when you approach the altar of incense you're to face you're to face towards eternity because in there is who you really are Hallelujah in there is the thoughts of God he has a VI before the foundation of the world that's why he said to Jeremiah tell Israel I know the thoughts I have concerning you [Music] people use that scripture as just positive thinking thoughts of and I can't remember the scripture thoughts of good and not of evil put it up there for me when you find it because in the mind of God there's no evil thoughts of you there it is Jeremiah 29:11 I know the thoughts I think towards you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end what is the expected end expected by God not you you don't have to figure it out he has an expectation of you that's why he comes to Gideon greetings th Mighty Man of [Music] Val and Gideon's like is he are you talking to me thr in wine threshing wheat in the wine press hiding from the enemy oh he could have quoted this scripture but it hadn't been spoken yet I know the thoughts that I have of you hallelujah hallelujah so when you pray it's not Lord I'm nothing I'm just a sinner Lord I make so many mistakes I'm not worthy of anything you're just confessing the outer Court that's not what you're to confess because prayer is confession he's the high priest of our confession the high priest is in there we make profession in prayer Lord Our Father Who Art in Heaven other words I'm your son I'm your attribute come on Saints I'm part of you I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I know when I come before you in prayer you don't see me you don't see my mistakes you see the perfect blood of the [Music] Lamb I'm not here to claim anything on my own merits but I'm here to claim every promise that has been made by the lamb paid for by his blood Hallelujah there's so many places we could take this but we need to bring it to a close when the same angel that visited Zachariah said Zachariah you'll be dumb until this comes to pass because you doubted it didn't stop it from coming to pass but Zachariah you'll pay the price he went home they had a child just like the angel said then in another place the same Angel comes to a young woman and she doesn't have all the complexes that Zachariah [Music] had she doesn't have all the baggage that he has she's just a believer and she hears the word of the Angel and she says be it unto me according to Thy word it's just that simple Lord I have a need be it unto me according to your word daily ministration feeding on the word trimming the lamp and confessing the right confession if you're going to doubt if you are going to doubt doubt your [Music] doubts doubt your feelings doubt the lying vanities turn your face towards the Holy Temple turn your face towards eternity where your representation dwells [Applause] there and say oh great Jehovah Lord Jesus Christ be it unto me according to thy thoughts hallelu let's Stand Together daily [Music] ministration be it unto me according to Thy word I don't want to go any further this morning but I wonder if we bow our heads this morning maybe somebody's here that's not going to be here tonight but there's some that wants to say Lord I don't want to live in the outer [Music] Court I want to move into the holy of Holiness I want everything of my being to be oriented towards the [Music] Eternal we're going to hear about this in detail tonight the reality of the Eternal [Music] but if that's your desire as we pray why don't you just lift your hand Heavenly Father we have laid out your word that your children might understand themselves the battles they go through the struggles of life that's why we're here your molding our [Music] character you're bringing us Lord into the very stature of Jesus Christ for he is the firstborn among many [Music] brethren we are not your fullness but we are you there is a part of us that is Eternal everything else will pass away complexes will pass away bitterness will pass away but that which is written in heaven will never pass away so Lord take every life under your hand this morning make each one what you want them to be bring your word to pass in their lives and Lord as they open their not just their hearts but their minds to you may the Holy Spirit take the word and wash them in the water of the world until they see them eles standing spotless in your [Music] presence we give this service unto you in Jesus Christ name [Applause] amen amen [Music] this was very good teaching of the word you know how God took Moses and says I want to show you the pattern of the temple that you are going to build Moses saw the reality and he brought it here on Earth in simple form every part of that Temple was a great detail that should teach us on how we walk with God here on Earth you see I liked it when we see that God in the holy of holies and the men of God all Israel They Knew by faith that God lived behind those Bader skins so I want you to see your soul as that you know holy of holies when the temple was laid God entered in there and he never left he was always there and so you know God is in the soul but our daily life is R from the spirit real that's where you think from that's where you plan from that's where you have all the bad Troubles of your life so our daily walk is where we continually sin and it's in this room where we need a daily sacrifice that's why they were always in that middle room the priest but as far as the life at the center of the Soul it was established it was present it was there and I want you to know as a child of God that when God gets at the center of your soul he doesn't leave he doesn't go in every soul but he goes into the soul of the predestinated amen and as the Brothers told us the predestinated they already had their representation they had a body in the heavens and that's the reason why they believe so if what youres if your representation was eternal then what will God do with that representation if you fail how will God deal with it will he throw eternal life in hell so you see we have to deal with our spiritual failures on a daily [Music] basis and I want you to look at your brother the way God looks at him not the way you want to see him but the way God sees amen so I I want to say something here that if God constantly dwelt in the holy of holies he constantly dwells in your soul and now in the soul the Holy Spirit where he dwells he seeks to have preeminence Amen to take over your reasoning take over your affection to take over your choices that God now extends his control over your human spirit so the Holy Spirit takes over where the elements you want to work from the elements is like your education like the politics like the culture where it wants to control the Holy Spirit desires to take over that and every day the holy spirit will have something to point out and then you run back to the blood not that you are not alive on side but he's protecting the environment the surrounding where God dwell Hallelujah in the holy of holies I want to say there was maturity there was life when the RO of Aon got there it doesn't matter how old it was it come back to life again that's what's on the side of allow any promise to get in there and God will give it life are you together with me as long as it was in there it began to produce Galatians 5 it brought forth the fruit of the spirit are you together with me so we really appreciate God that God can speak to us I heard the brother believing is in the mind but faith is in the soul are you together with so in my mind let me have eternal thoughts when I hear the word I don't want to hear it like somebody would hear it from the outside I want to hear it like I'm hearing it from the mouth of God because the word of God when it comes to you it never goes back forward without fulfilling what sent are you together with me faith in the soul does not stugger because it's managed by God Amen on side there so let our faith look towards eternity because the word is already established whenever the word comes to you it's already established that's what Zariah failed to know that's what you struggle for amen don't be like Zar be like a Mary it to be me according to Thy word amen when you say let it you have opened the door to the and there the word becomes you see is very wonderful this was very good teaching let the word step inside and let the word confess and let it become life I am a son of God I come from God I'm going back to God are you together with me that's what you should always say amen and once a brother confesses shake his hand amen because he's speaking the mind of God about himself he's confessing and God is giving life to his confession don't go walking around and and then you start pointing at people that's God bless you brother Moses do you love him this afternoon do you appreciate our brother amen is coming to give more amen today let red be against red amen and let you be as white as snow amen just open that gate because in there is maturity hallelujah hallelujah in there is eternal life in there the man never di so allow what you hear not end here God I'm opening my soul God is good what God made sure is that he's on the throne and he controlled and Israel believed that God was behind those B skins and God deals with that seed gin that's the M the female part and God comes and then there is an invisible Union amen amen and out of there life becomes to flow out God bless you let us be here in the afternoon amen let's clap for the preacher give yeah give me song number 25
