going to read verse verse this also that in the last days perious times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves cous bers proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors he High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive s women ladden with sins LED away with last ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth may the Lord bless his word amen amen so I want us to talk uh to to have a study we're not talking about times but my title shall be at our point of need at our point of need praise the Lord so we are simply taking a a simple text from this scripture of second Timothy says times shall come and when you look at the description of the perious times the Bible says these times will create a virtue of love in the hearts of men because shall come for men shall be LS of their own selves so they shall love themselves more than loving God so now we see a vacuum of love in the hearts of men says there shall be a vacuum because men shall move from Ling and serving and they shall take away that love for themselves and because they don't love God they now they now exposed to the evil spirits says they shall become highed bers Blasphemous disobedient to parents unth unappreciative Unholy not appreciating what they are and what they have and now the Bible says they shall have a form of godliness but yet they deny the power of God for the word of God and now at that time when Jesus was describing those times he says there shall be a spirit of deception why because the people have rejected God he gives them up to unclean spirits he exposes them up become highed praise the Lord they highed they bers they don't love God they love themselves and the things that hold dear to them and now Jesus said it will be such a horrible time because in that time there will be a false anointing false anointing upon the teachers of the word Jesus calls them false prophets says they shall come before the end time and they shall teach people the doctrines of men and not the word of God why because the people have rejected the word of God because the people think they are they have all they are enough so they don't love God they don't love his word they reject him and spw him away praise the Lord and now Jesus said because of that condition of the hearts of the people the people are now [Applause] exposed praise the Lord false teaching and now that false teaching creates AAP it creates a vume of love for the word of God praise the Lord now let us read here in Matthew 24: see what Jesus talks about says as a result as a result no just inter as a result people will have a thirst that isn't being lifted praise the Lord why because the truth has been turned away from them and they have been exposed to a false teaching and because there is a false teaching there is a life inside that shall thir for deliverance shall for the true manifestation of the word of God and it says and many false prophets shall AR shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall Works cold but he that shall endure the end the same shall be saved and then he says and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness All Nations and then the end shall come praise the Lord the end comes what brother is going through all their attention shall be to their personal satisfaction praise the Lord times of pray for one another the times of pray for one another Sor the times of praying as it was in the other church when the apostles when they prayed one for another when they checked on one another when they move from house to house in these various times that love grow the brothers together shall not be there because men shall only mind about themselves High minded and shall not end there but they shall have a form of godliness they profess to have a religion profess to have a form of godliness yet they deny the power of God deny the true word of God praise the Lord and now Jesus says that in that time there shall come false prophets with a false anointing and they shall receive so many people and then he says iniquity shall increase shall increase and Men shall be exposed to evil and because of that the love of many works praise the Lord and then he says but they so in the midst of all these perils in the midst of all this iniquity in the midst of all this Disobedience he says there shall be a people that shall endure Until the End praise the Lord but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved and now Zarah tells us praise the Lord that it shall be such a dark time it shall be darkened because of iniquity because of sin praise the Lord shall be such a dark hour but then the prophet Zarah tells us even in that day praise the Lord it shall be one day we shall be known unto the Lord praise the Lord that shall be known un the Lord zear 14: it shall be one day praise the Lord when the entire world when the Earth has been exposed to fithness When sin has covered theface of the Earth there is no good in the land when the people are evil and they not concerned about it praise the Lord when the evil spirits have taken over praise the Lord said there shall be one that shall endure all those situations Zarah tells us in that day there shall be one day that shall be known unto the Lord nor day nor night because it shall be a of confusion the Lord of Darkness not know whether shall be day or night but there is an assurance that there shall be a day that shall come says it shall come to pass there shall be an evening time evening time it shall be light praise the Lord because there has to be a people that must bear the light of the Lord people that must manifest the true word of God stand the test of time because Jesus said this goes for the kingdom shall out be preached even in the midst of gross darkness and Disobedience this gospel shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then the shall come this various time shall come they are not the end of life not the end of the world and Jesus said yes you shall hear them say here is the prophet here is the Christ says don't go after them praise the Lord says gospel which we have believed this gospel which we preach this gospel which is Christ himself he says in the midst of all that is going to happen it must be preached to All Nations for a witness and that gospel which Jesus speaks about is that evening light Zar speaks about in that day in that hour which is not nor night a wave of confusion then he says there shall emerge a light evening is going to come at a time when people are we evening time shall be an evening time the evening people have been working all day long people are tired they have been tossed by the cares of the world they have been tossed by all kinds of wild doctrines and they have a thirst they thirsting to go back home and have a rest praise the Lord they working here and there here is the Christ and they run over the group here is the Christ and they run over and when they they reach there they don't find a thing that shall satisfy their soul they come out and then they he here is another Christ then they run over them and they reach there they don't find him so they are moving here and there and they now very exhausted and very [Applause] tired until some have lost hope praise the Lord many have lost trust in the word the prophet says at that particular time there shall come an evening light the Lord evening light the light of hope that shall direct the people their Everlasting home shall bring the people to their rest is that evening light that is taking us to our Eternal rest day night and there shall be light praise the Lord And now when the people shall hear this light about the news of the light and hear the voice that speaks out of the light he shall speak healing to their souls shall Speak etal Life to their hearts themto Christ shall point to the word the message [Applause] of Praise the Lord when there is confusion when there is gross darkness when there is evil all over when false prophets when are false christes teaching people of men and leaving them into confusion such a time that creates a vacuum and thirst in The Souls of men evening light comes it shall satisfy their souls why because it is this evening light isting us home you know you're tired and your day has been all worked up here and there you tested this Faith you tested this religion praise the Lord Ted the other Pastor he a man of God and because you have a thirst in your heart you have a need in your heart you need salvation you notate then you run over them there is another great man of God into the city he has a special anointing because of the run over them and they get there their hopes they don't see hope there because there is no life to satisfy their thirst but when they come into the countenance of the evening light man comes into this experience of the evening light the evening it's not excitement the evening light Promises of men the evening light simply the Revelation praise the Lord the revelation of who we are the revelation of Jesus Christ pointing us to him that us life and so it is that light it is that message it is that word that satisfies our souls perious time shall come be lovers of themselves more than lovers of God but in that time this Gospel of the Kingdom must be preached the world for a witness this message must be preached en world for a witness and they that shall endure to the end not by our power not by our might not because you have knowledge of the word shall endure why because they have Christ in their lives and it is Christ that gives them the grace and ability to endure these perils praise the Lord says such that shall endure the same shall be saved praise the Lord and now in the evening time praise the lord we have received the light when we exhausted receive the life to give us a new life the light that shines in the darkness the flee it shall be light the home from the TOs the pains the misery of the day to lead them to their Eternal rest Christus and this is the evening time and the gospel that we preach the message we have received the message of behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord behold I the prophet before the end of time praise the Lord he shall preach a gospel the same gospel which is the light the evening time and it shall eliminate the hearts of men turn them from Darkness to them from fness turn them from being high high minded to from having a form of godliness it shall bring them to the word shall turn themto Christ praise the lording light that directs us and takes us home then he gets this light and sheds it into the hearts of men to fill up the vacuum to fill it with love to fill it with forgiveness to fill it with empathy praise the Lord fill it with that love of God and the love of many works is called Praise the Lord there is this light breaks down the love of Christ in our lives wherein we can share the same love our share the same love the rest of the world well the people care much about themselves the love of Christ in our lives cares for the things of God praise the Lord and now there is a growing desire when this light comes in our lives when you receive this light evening it brings a desire for nothing else but the word of God praise the Lord there is confusion and misery all over the faces of many there is an of Hope upon the hearts of them that believe for the word rest in our hearts and because that word our heart gives us satisfaction it fills up the thirst praise the Lord gives us that at satisfaction where you're not lingering you not TOS here and there you have that at confidence and trust that this gospel which you have believed is nothing but the truth that this gospel which you have believed is nothing but Christ himself that this gospel which we have received is nothing but eternal life so now when they shall say here is the Christ the word that rests inside of your soul it gives you the satisfaction to remain where you are to be grounded praise the Lord and also have the ability to discern the Antichrist Spirit praise the Lord so you get this desire you get this satisfaction and in the moments of need in the times of distress in the times of Miser you have a hope that he that is in you has the ability to come in storm to come any storm that may arise in your life while in that hour which living be here run over to go be prayed for by man of God with great anointing praise the Lord as they running over them those great Crusades you have a satisfaction does not mean you don't have needs have needs as the body of Christ but we have a satisfaction because he gave us his word and he say Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and you have sto the kingdom of God you are settled in his words that you have the confidence the rest of the things shall follow the rest of the things shall come praise the Lord you have the faith to believe you have faith to believe you have enough faith that it is a finished work praise the Lord you don't have to run here and there he says believe and when you believe all things are possible praise the Lord yes we get perplexed sometimes the pastor was preaching about tensions and it's a part of our life it's a part of our experiences also got perplexed also got in his work the Lord and then he could come to a point and says but I am a good man I'm a servant of God I always strive to do that which is Pleasant unto my master but why every time I think of doing good evil is always present with me and he says why praise the Lord also get moments of desperation also get time could come when also reached those moments of desperation those moments of misery moments of tension in his life and he cry out to God praise the Lord but the Bible tells us at such a Time the spirit spoke unto him and say you know I am your ever presentent help Grace will never leave you is just sufficient for you and at that time when you feel you are so weak says I am perfected in your times of weakness because at that time you surrender Yourself Praise the Lord move away from the corridors of bursting from the of beinged of total surrender knowing that it's noer you that live knowing that it's no longer your ability to overcome it's not your ability about situation in life but you stand still know that he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world that's when he says you have noticed it my child now my grace is ever sufficient for you and it's perfected in your weaknesses praise the Lord because in there you learn not depend on your self rightous but rather learn lean on the Everlasting arm of God he never fails and if he never fails he can never fail us at our point of need let me qu in let the word of God havein praise the Lord no matter in any kind of service let in any kind of service the word should have preeminence it should be fast and the healing of the soul is always F while the people are looking for the healing of their bodies let the healing of our souls be F when a man is Born Again of the spirit of God he has immortal etal life and shall never perish we have been born of God we have been born of the spirit we have received the spirit of God there's no doubt about it you have eternal life is of the is forever he becomes a new creature in Christ when he is healed of his soul so when does the highest become the lowest that heem the simp man you and I the fellow of God so in the C of men no matter where it is or how many have he will come and he says he crossed the St sea one night the land of because man one Mania was calling for him and had need and as he was meeting that Maniac the people thought that it would cost them some Hogs it would cost them some Hogs if they were if they would have a Revival so they had him to leave the land and he always goes away when he's not wanted yes sir because they don't believe because of their iniquity he exposes them up to evil spirits and the prophet says here when they don't show that they turns Andes to his own country God speaks considerably and every word has Eternal meaning every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God now if he said SE first and his righteous and all things shall be added unto you what next then seek Him and wait upon him be there remind him about his word because the prophet says every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God has Eternal meaning it has power and it never fail and says and I may say may I say the weakest of Saint here tonight here tonight it help you when Jesus was on Earth he was all of the godhead Bly he was God tabernacling in flesh in the Jesus was just not a prophet he was God and he if he was able to himself body of Jesus etal great God if he left the throne and he came of man for the purpose of reconciling us to himself how much more will he do praise the Lord when we come to a point of need when we need his intervention praise the Lord he still keeps his words and the prophet says he will cross over to come to our point of need he keeps his promises and let us look at the Widow and elah praise the Lord God has a need to meet he does everything possible anything possible to prove his word praise the Lord when you have a need your need touches God touches God when he left the throne he came down and became one of us when he became one of us he overcame death after he overcame death he went back and now he returned as our high priest that is touched by every feeling that we have that is touched by each one of our situation and he is ready to do anything for the sake of his body the sake of his body to prove his word that he is our high priest that is touched by the feeling in so now here is the Widow there was the Widow who had the son and now in that time praise the Lord God had closed the heavens and there was no rain and now God sent Elijah to go to the Brooks that was before praise the Lord a river that was flowing with there was some kind of was flowing with water or a something and now the land had become dry it was dry because God had closed the heavens that there would be no rain and now when Elijah was there God sent r and also water from the for his thirst but now time came the brook also dried praise the Lord and when it dried God never spoke the brook to bring water praise the Lord Remember When the Children of Israel were traversing the wilderness they became thirsty and the land was dry there was no water God spoke to Moses the spoken word asked him to strike the rock to bring out water God had the same ability to speak to Elijah do something so it would bring water praise the Lord never did it and got to a point of need he became thirsty and he wanted to drink what did God tell him he never told him to speak elah was waiting upon the Lord he was Believing on God on every step of his life he had surrendered it was no longer him that was living but was living after the life of God why says this time of life it it has to be God himself it should be no longer I anymore but Christ because if it is I I will fail at the test of time is Christ he overcame already and because he overcame I will also overcome so now I have to surrender myself out and allow Christ himself to live in me now elah never questioned God but God you instructed the Ravens and they bring me food praise the Lord in the morning and the evening you can still instruct them to bring me water no he never did that he told him go over praise the Lord and say there is a widow God had planned something now God wanted to satisfy the thirst of [Music] Elijah that was his need but at the same time the wi the other side also had a need and she was waiting upon the Lord maybe she had prayed maybe she had fasted and it was not raining and now she in the land now God asks Elijah came to pass and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had not there had been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying that's El arise get thee to Zer which belong to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee was a Believer a faithful he believed that God would have the ability to do something for him when he was there but he never questioned God he listened and obeyed to the voice of the Lord and that made the difference that makes the difference we believe and take God his God knows that we have a need in our life God knows that we have a weakness in our lives but let us take God at his word let us obey what the word says about our situation and that God come to our Rescue of need and notice the WID say prepared the Widow to sustain thee but the Widow who God has prepared only one meal left and she was going to die that was her last hope she had prayed and she had given up maybe if it rained if it had rained last meal she not have seen the of the Lord she not believe that it is God that caused the RS to come maybe it look so natural to but God had to hold the r God will hold that thing that we have asked for many years will hold that you had for a long time until we come to a point when we shall know believe that this has happened not because of my power because of my righteousness not because I'm a good man because of the Lord himself we come that point surrender then he says that he comes and says yeah that is me my Grace has been sufficient with you all this long it is time for you to receive your prayer I have set a widow to sustain thee but this is a widow who is at the brink of death who is at the brink of death and now in verse 10 he says so he arose without questioning and mamming and went to zath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the Widow was there Gathering but at the same time the spirit told him to ask her why because when she obey the voice and she was going to do according as the man of God had instructed to bring him water he asked said as she was going to fch it called her and said bring me I pray thee a muscle of bread in hand listen to her answer and she said as the Lord thy God live I have not a cake but un handful of meal in the barrel and a little oil in the and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elah said unto her that was her [Music] confession it was a genuine confession that was she prayed and prayed and prayed and she didn't see it happening she went cook the last meal that particular time when she came out of house it's when God s elij so she was collecting the two scks to go and prepare theal then saw at the point of giving up that's when God sent a messenger in the evening time in the evening time various times in the darkest of time God sends a light the evening to give us hope to shed everlasting life when people are afraid of death walls and rumors of walls countries try to prepare for war how they can survive we have hope that there is a life that is waiting us Beyond this Natural Life praise the Lord she has lost hope God sent the messenger her point of and now listen to the instructions elah said to her fear not go and do as thou Hast said but make me first a little cake and bring it to me after make for thee and son that's what God told her praise the Lord and she never hesitated she never called him a mean man she never said you're too selfish she took God at his word even at that point of need last hour praise the Lord when literally everything seems to have ended there is voice there is a voice that speaks to us that speaks our little faith praise the Lord let finish this and for thus the Lord God of Israel the Barrow of me shall not waste neither shall the Cru of oil fail until the the day that the Lord s rain upon the Earth and when she went and did Accord the word of the Lord the Bible says her house many days why she took at his word never complained she never seek here first praise the Lord and now if you have S him rest in his word rest in his promises regardless of how others are becoming rich and flourishing are building and driving and doing ABCD and So Many Wonders rest in the word of God you are a son of God you are a daughter of God has given you his word his word never fails but his word shall not fail trusting his word shall come to your point of need and he shall supply your need say at his word ministered the Lord she ministered El and remember God always remembers our labors he never forgets our labors he doesn't forget every little things that you do for the body of Christ now there a time now this woman was ministering and she quenched her thirst when she gave him water to drink now she also came to another point of need her son died but because of her labor God remembered her and gave her son back to life when Elijah was praying for the son he was reminding god of the works that this woman had done for him when he was in the point of need so now keep in the word and keep the word and keep ministering the body of Christ be faithful keep right there God will always remember us remember you praise the Lord not be yourself it could be your children or your grand children but God will remember you they come to a point of distress when they come to a point of need because of your labors God will come to their resue praise the Lord sir has done that so many times there another Widow who had Sons two sons in the days of elishah Praise the Lord and the Bible says her husband was a son to the prophets praise the Lord the prophets that ministered unto the Lord praise the Lord man also feared God and now they had a de and theator was coming to take their children to become slaves because they had failed to meet the and now she sees El Elish and she runs in chapter 4 verse one of Second Kings and now she cried praise the Lord says now the there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha they was they was the husband was a son to one of the prophets who ministered God and maybe they had left thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy Serv did fear the lord she was go to help her upon the basis of the services of her
