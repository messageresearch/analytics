========================================

and with his son Jesus Christ is and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full name this then is the message which we've heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is not Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sins yes governor contribution then it also means joint participation you know like even as many opportunities of fellowships praise the name of our Lord and you know as a human being remember in the beginning God said it's not good for man to be alone so then he made Eve and he now was a good Fellowship you know she complemented him you know she kind of like and then you know Eve was the reflection of Adam praise the name of our Lord and then our Lord Jesus Christ comes down and then he tells us that where a family is a good Avenue of fellowship and then now when you go and visit another it's also another time of fellowship and then when we come here to church then the fellowship is bigger it's bigger than we can have at our families and now like for example the children are in holidays but then how much time do you spend talking to your children how much time do your children spend talking to you and then you see what the devil has done he has brought technology so everybody can be on their phone foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] and you know sometimes somebody would want to talk to you some things and for you for them they may think this is the right time to speak to him but then for you and maybe on your phone or you are engaged on something and maybe when they are talking you're not seeing their expressions you're not seeing you're not getting into their feelings at the end of the day you pay little attention to that issue and yet some of these things can affect that person because you've not really get the feeling of the person and then you know there are some places oh there are some people who are smart about this maybe these are places of work or maybe in some kind of society they know right that they will time you when you are busy when your mind is caught up somewhere else and then they will ask you your mind is not in it you are not about you're not so much kind of like giving in what they are telling you then afterwards you hear that something has been done and they say but you're the one who gave the concepts yet you you did but because you are not in True Fellowship with that so you see the devil many times also comes that it takes that sweet moment of Fellowship from us like as a family you get this one the devil is making him do the other side and they had to have time together but when need to make good use of the time when we come together praise the name of our Lord when we come together we need to make good time when we come into the presence you know you come with all your hearts you come with all your mind you come with all with one Accord with the noble move praise the name of God you don't come to church and then your mind is somewhere maybe in your business you don't come to church maybe your mind is maybe at school or some work you're meant to do or assignments like now the devil can start telling you oh time has gone praise the name of our Lord and then your mind is completely switched to some other activities then your body is present but then your heart is far away from there you know we should not be like the children in the marketplace let us go to Luke chapter 7. praise the name of Allah Luke chapter 7 and then verse 29. so the scriptures say yes and all the people that had him and the publicans Justified God being baptized with the baptism of John never never never never was under you know there is something interesting about John and Jesus praise the name of us you know when the Pharisees when the secrets when the priests when they went to John the Baptist because he was baptizing in the desert praise the name of our Lord and then they were asking him who are you who do you call yourself praise the name of our Lord but when the saudias the publicans the prostitutes when they went to John the Baptist they were asking him what do we do praise the name of Allah then when they come to Jesus Christ the Pharisees they're secretes you know the priests started asking him by what Authority do you do these things who gave you permission when the prostitutes came to Jesus when the Sinners come to Jesus have mercy upon us Deliver Us Praise the name of Allah so then it depends on how one comes to the fellowship praise the name of our Lord so now after now that kind of scenario the Bible says Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the cancer of God therefore is against themselves being not baptized of him so they come to Jesus and then they were asking him by what power do you do this then Jesus told them I will also ask you one question the baptism of John is it of God or it's from men these were Pharisees so what they did they said let us go and have some kind of material that's kind of disgusting and the people were there waiting so now they started the same I had this question here if we tell him it is of god he will ask us why didn't you believe John all right so the deliberate rejected and then they say if we say it's of men the people around will Stone us because they believe John was a problem so they're just playing politics so when then they say so what we tell him we don't you know that we did so they came back and told him we don't know and the same Spirits are around today they keep on playing Colorado praise the name of our Lord so then Jesus gives this Parable yes in verse 31 because of Netherlands and the Lord said where unto then shall I liken the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like children sitting in the marketplace calling one to another and saying we have pipe down to you [Music] and you have not danced we have more than to you and you have not wept look at this scenario you get your friends in the marketplace and then maybe you think your music will excite them but you start playing music you start they are not dancing and then now this one thought maybe they are sorry maybe they have lost something [Music] when they started praise the name of our Lord so when you look what that stration there can never be fellowships as much as you may be in a common place but when you don't have the same Spirits so now I went at our homes let us learn to get into the spirit of fellowship and when we get into Fellowship let it be sweet Fellowship praise the name of Allah the love of God coming down the kindness of God you know that family members are comfortable being at home even if now the children but if they have made the mistake at school or somewhere let them be peaceful at home let them find comforters let the children not find the home is a dangerous place to live like most of these Street children when you follow them they had problems at their homes either the parents were mistreating only that made the mistake and they had thrown them they end up on the streets so we shouldn't allow those kind of circumstances so even as when we come here to church and we are coming for Fellowship let us seek sweet fellowships the presence of God coming down praise the name of Allah now in the message foreign amen so brother Brandon says this time of fellowships all Dr boswas a friend of mine many of you might have known brother he was one of the centralist old man it is two fellows in one ship so they have to share a little bit so that's what Fellowship is share with each other to our governance so you come you know like the brother was exalting us you come prayed up what we're going to happen you know you come with something to give him not only your presence but now when it is time to praise the Lord then you live raise up holy hands praise the name of Allah the Bible says lifting up holy Hearts praise the name of our Lord amen and you know we need to have more Liberty here at church then we have at home you know our presence of one praise the name of God we need to get into the spirit of Fellowship praise the name of Allah when you go to the spots those footballers they get into the spirit of them the athletes when you see watching them running they get into the spirit even that's when we come into here we need to allow you know we need to be happy when we come into the presence of God we need to always seek a time of sweet fellowships and you know when you come with that kind of you get into anatomas your sweet Fellowship then you find that your burdens are taken away you go home you are delivered from your bosses you are delivered from your fears how we need to seek such each time of feelings the message God has a provided way God has a provided when the time it of God Honda which is right here which is here right now the great Holy Spirit moving over the building that sweetness of Fellowship that draws Us close to him letting us know that our sins be pardoned that money sentence our iniquity is gone when we are ready to confess our wrongs God is willing to forgive us so whenever we come to church we need to see that Lord I want to be in your presence enjoy the presence of God being in that kind of sweet Fellowship take time speak to one another remember Pastor was telling us that he there is a brother in the U.S so he was preaching a service and he told the people to remove their wrist watches and then you just wait you just hear the preaching foreign [Music] [Music] foreign so Fellowship is not so much talking that in me I think in the 50s people's love for one another is not there everybody until you hear about the Neighbors on the news some people are no longer concerned about it you just hear something has happened but somebody else is telling you may be a stranger calls you that I'm told that in your place there was decent over here so we are we seem to be just individualistic because praise the name of our Lord but that was not the purpose of God desires us to have such a good time of fellowships praise the name of our Lord then in the message remembering the Lord let us just in sweetness of Fellowship while sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ everything from your heart and remember God's word says I am his servant he's here then let us shake hands with somebody rise up and go [Applause] you know you are so much in that fellowship with the Holy Spirit until you know you are so happy praise the name of Allah you are not traveled about anything and you know God is someone such concerned about our emotions about you know what comes out of your heart praise the name of our Lord in Luke chapter one and then verse 14. you know Zachariah was in the temple offering sacrifices and then the angel came down and then the angel told him about his prayer being answered in Luke chapter 1 verse 13. but the Angels said unto him for thy prayer is and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear the essence and then now you see how God take so much interest and gladness and many shall rejoice at his best so God is always concerned you know about the state of your heart foreign stood for stimulation you know they were quoting the talking about what you Gaga and they work together and they talk together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and the reasons Jesus himself brought near yes and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him by the moment together and he said unto them what manner of communication and this that you have one over another foreign so we are looking at like we have problems at home we are brothers but if I tell you that I didn't sleep at night and then you say oh may I even had good dreams and then you say we are not Brothers let us encourage one another praise the name of our Lord have something good to bring up like now this is for yourself for about Christ I'm saying now we thought it would deliver us we thought you'd do this like the disciples even the disciples they were saying we thought you're going to take away these Romance when are you going to come and take over the country and then he told them it's in the father's time to know the times and the seasons so these people are communing together by the way [Applause] where is your face they were having the same The Same Spirit of the rest of the unbelievers upon them like now the days how the Bible says should we also cry the way the world cries to tell the world in the midst of all those troubles we have our Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of the challenge in the ministry of the troubles we have one Lord who is a master of all those things so now Jesus told them why are you saying you're communing with one another fellowship but in sadness [Music] we need to get into an atmosphere of the sweetness of Fellowship praise the name of Allah now we shall get back the scripture but I want us to go to Acts chapter 2. and then verse 42 so the Bible says and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in the breaking of bread and in prayers and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and the breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of Hearts praising God and having favor with all the peace foreign and then you broke he took the bread in verse Luke chapter 24 verse 30. and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed him and break and gave to them and their eyes and they knew him and he vanished out of their sights and they said one to another they did not our heart ban within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us description we need that kind of Fellowship Lord speak to me speak to my house reveal yourself to me we need to seek moments of sweetness good communion [Music] praise the name of our living God I'm saying time is running fast praise the name of our Lord now let us go to let us share another scripture here in Exodus chapter 4. and then verse 14. a Canada Exodus and then verse 14. so here Moses was giving good excuses they will not hear me you are sending me and then God told him Exodus chapter 4 verse 14. and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said it is and I know that he can't speak well and also behold the cometh first meeting and when he sees thee when Jacob was meeting Joseph after very many years let us go to Genesis praise the name of our Lord Genesis chapter 46 and then we read from verse 4. and Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Bathsheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father Isaac Israel and God spoken to Israel in the visions of the night and saying Jacob Jacob and said here am I oh no and he said I am God the god of thy father fear not go down into Egypt for I will they are make of thee a great nation now your guarantee he is I'll go down with thee into Egypt and I also surely bring thee up again and Joseph shall put his hand upon Thine Eyes what an assurance from God praise the name of Allah Jacob seeking God before he would go to Egypt and then the lord gave him an assurance that I will be with you and I will multiply and even Joseph whom you are seeking children he was going to touch your eyes what an encouragement and the Lord would desire to encourage us he likes to encourage so when we come into Fellowship let us have sweet fellowships and you know Fellowship as we say means communion means communication means distribution or contributions means Association so each of us has a path to play praise the name of Allah each of us has a part to play now in fast Korean Corinthians the scripture says God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ so we have been called into this Fellowship of our Lord Jesus Christ what does it mean we have been called to be part of the body okay First Corinthians chapter 12 says we are members of one body so depending on what kind of party let your path contribute because Fellowship is sharing Fellowship is contributing Fellowship is participating praise the name of Allah so each of us when we come let us be praying let let us be meditative you know about the word of God and you know what the Lord you desire the Lord to do and let every joint Supply praise the name of our Lord let us all of us be willingness like brother Brandon I'm saying we are all leaks of fire so when we come together then we have a bigger fire she call me praise the name of us so each joint should Supply let us go to First Corinthians praise the name of Allah each of our joints should supplies praise the name of Allah that's verse 25. later that there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another movie and whether one members suffer all members suffer with it or one member be honored all members Rejoice with it is now are you the body of Christ and the members in particular Christ praise the name of Allah so every part should participate praise the name of our Lord and then we can have that kind of sweet Fellowship foreign lesbian the Bible says the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ is true um praise the name of Allah like we have in communion tonight we are going to share governor of the body of Christ when we come to church right now what are we doing we are sharing of the world praise the name of Allah so then he says here the cup of blessings is it the communion of the blood of Christ and then what does the blood stand for the spirit the Holy Spirit and then he says the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ so the body stands for words so whenever we come into Fellowship let us seek that the presence of the Holy Spirit comes down in our hearts even as the word is shared and then now let us finish with second Corinthians chapter six second Corinthians chapter six and then read in verse 14. the Bible says be not an equally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship has righteousness without righteousness and what communion has light with darkness and what conquered as Christ with failure or what part are they that Believers with an Infidel era crystals when we receive Christ in our hearts we have accepted that fellowship and our fellowship with Christ should always be continuous praise and the name of Allah should always be continued no wonder the scripture read in first John chapter one and say that we have fellowship with one another and our fellowship is with the father it should be a continuous Fellowship but areas of unrighteousness things of Darkness come and this thought that Fellowship they come and disrupt that Fellowship so you cannot commune with Christ so then you need to get out of those kind of areas that disrupt The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit you need to avoid those kind of things bitterness you know they grieve the Holiness so then you get time for we need to seek sweetness and have that sweet time of Fellowship the sweetness of Fellowship we cannavity at church as a family and then you can have it also as an individual praise the name of Allah and when you're in the sweet Fellowship of the Holy Spirit you know praise the name of our Lord the Bible says that Angels coming down ascending and descending praise the name of our Lord just coming down to sweetness [Applause] [Music] where we know we know wait on the Lord amen [Applause] [Applause] Brother Joseph you can come we're gonna this one what a fellowship we have
