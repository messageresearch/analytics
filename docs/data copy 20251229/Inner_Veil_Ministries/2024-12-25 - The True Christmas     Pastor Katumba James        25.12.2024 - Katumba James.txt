hearts praise the name of the Lord you know he was born in a stable very dir Place praise the name of our Lord and he has chosen us born in sin that he can be born in Us Praise the name of our Lord so it doesn't matter our conditions Christ still wants to be born in our heart praise the name of so on Friday we have an overnight prayer meeting then on Sunday we having a visiting Minister from Ghana apost Isaac son is who is a friend of brother Jeremiah so he's going to minister on Sunday in one service then next week on Wednesday which will be first of the new year we are going to have an afternoon service starting at 3 and then we have also the Lord's Supper on 1 of January so you come prepared also for that then after this weekend the next weekend we are going to have brother Steven do he'll be coming here and preaching for two services so you're also welcome is also going to be a very busy month for us in January we are going to be having a number of visiting ministers so we just keep that in prayers and still I'll will call upon your support praise the name of when we having two Services if bring visitors to have a meal together we really need your contributions praise the name of Lord so let us stand up on our feet and maybe another thing is to remind the youth theth convention starting on Sunday until end on Wes you meant to pay 100,000 so those who are going it is good for us to know who are going brother Robert was asking me about the those who are coming brother robt so if you going at least you get me informed that we can know how many people are going to those meetings from chise the name of our so let us go to Luke Chapter 2 and then verse one and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when sarus was governor of Syria and all went to be tax everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea andto the city of David which is called bethleem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with the child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wbed him in the swling clothes and laid him in the manger because there was no room for them in the Inn let us pray father we thank you for the reading of the word we pray that the Holy Spirit may come and give us understanding in your word that that will encourage us and guide us in the path that still lays ahead of us may speak to us in such a speci Lord and bless everyone of us Lord and meet all our needs Lord For the Glory of your holy name in the name of Jesus Christ ask this amen you may be seated so I just want to take some time and talk about the true Christmas praise the name of our Lord the true Christmas Christmas and we see that the world takes 25th December as the Christmas but when you go back in the reality of it Christ was not born on 25th December praise the name of our Lord but the world takes it like that because some crafted it that way now Christ was born as a lamb praise the name of the Lord and in Palestine now it's winter and it has been winter even before so the animals are not in the field but they they in the house they are not on the Hills grazing they are inside the house because it is very cold and sometimes could even snow so they cannot be out there and then when you read in the scriptures here in Luke chap 2 the Bible says let us go to Luke Chapter 2 and then verse 8 and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night so the Sheep were in the field the Shepherds were in the field in Winter you can't get such a thing so you see that the season and the time they are not right according to the scripture praise the name of the sheep are always out there during the Spring Time when the weather is somehow warm praise the name of that's when they out there but you know when it is called they in the houses praise the name of our now in the message God's Gift always find their places but it really should be it says it should be teaching their children what real Christmas is and I totally do not believe that Christ could be born on 25th day of December in Judea because it is CER than it is here now how could Shepherds be keeping their flock by night and then the Taxation and everything and Mary having to come that far from way down in bethem up to Juda up into Jus for taxation I hardly could believe that you know even the timing of movement is not because these people didn't have cars at that time they were either using horses or Caravans you know where they get some kind of thing and then they move and you know Nazareth and Bethlehem Nazareth and Bethlehem is a long distance praise the name of the Lord so now the season was not right you know like the scripture says pray that your flight is not in the winter or on the Sabbath day because winter was a hard time to travel how could the how could the the emperor say go for taxation when he knows it is difficult to move so you see that they don't rhyme together then he says I believe okay how could that be it could not be done but I believe that Christ was born in a spring because in every way he was a lamb you notice he was born in a barn and not in a house the name of now the world puts a day one day in a and you know everybody jubilates you know it's just like a storm coming every person was living so the storm comes and throws you maybe to now after that one day of Christmas again another stor comes and choices from G and the words about business the music industry Entertain You Know clothing industry everything and even those who are selling food all but the food is the same food we eat praise the name of our it's just business and then some people they see Christmas as the only day they go to church and as we were traveling we got many people coming out of church or entering church and in some of the churches if the the preacher delays to finish the sermon then they [Music] start it's about fting and then in some Churches when the minister is preaching then a lady comes from behind ENT and then he just [Music] makes she would want show the phone she's having the hand she's having how the hair is made then she comes and sits everybody's eyes are turning and then say maybe the hair is for 50,000 that b it was 100,000 that CL is about this much then the shoes and and that's the mindset of the people and then some when she has just sat when she has just she Lees the phone on everybody turns then she goes out and all the people's eyes are there go there for display not to worship God praise the name of our and then on these days these religious systems they want to make a lot of money gift oh we are selling this we are doing this announc the annual program and then those who live in Campland have come to the Village they want to show that they can contribute a lot me I'm contributing 1 million I'm contributing this you know so it is not the genuine worship they don't have the Christmas they have been given a fake Christmas so we need to find out what is the true Christmas praise the name what was the reason for Christ coming why was Christ born because if we don't get to know why Christ was born we also perish like the rest of the world they are in wickedness they are in all forms of evils you know a lot of wickedness done in this season may be more than what is done the rest of [Music] there even businessmen most of them make the profit at this season and then that profet can take them through the time when they are not making prophets and so Satan gets the the the the deist gets a day Christ was born and then he says this is it and every evil thing is done but that should not be to us people who have seen the light praise the name of our to the World Christmas is eating a lot of meat you know eating the things you have not eaten yesterday were in hospital I taken my daughter Esther and then I was surprised that the place where many patients always are admitted there was no patient there all the beds were empty and so my daughter was there and we were with so now then the medical person told me said tomorrow that is today this evening going to have too many patience what's the problem what people are eating some are eating things which are not well prepared some are eating things too much things and even some die so to the World Christmas is feasting but for us Christmas should be feasting on the word of God praise the name of our Lord because man shall not live by bread alone but by everyone that comes out of the mouth that should be the true Christmas at time of feasting a Time ofly convocation and it should not only be one day in the year every day should be our Christmas every day should be our feast waiting on the Lord seeking the face of God doing the things that please God praise the name of our now in the message while Bethlehem he says you've got to humble yourself until you see that until you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will what we try to do as soon as God gives us a little shower of blessings we try to TST it up and get in there that's going to make great big names and out do the other one this one starts this way godes the whole thing what we need today is a fresh pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon hearts that is humble we need a real Christmas a birth place if you could realize that you are nothing but a stable God didn't go to Jerusalem to sh or R he come to a St that was polluted when you let God you become and realize in yourself that you are nothing but a stinking St but welcome open your doors when this great big places and in are turning him away open your doors of the manger of your heart and let Jehovah come in D and watch what takes place for he is the word he said if you abide in me and my word in you he is the word let him come into you and watch what takes place then ask what you will and it will be done for you praise the name of our Lord what a true Christmas true Christmas is when Christ is born in your heart and that should be our desire Lord be born in my heart let me not be as I have been praise the name of our Lord that's the true Christmas christ himself living in us that's the true meaning of Christmas for the world they are looking at history he was born on this day and you know what they do from last week course maybe the whole month have been trying to practice you know Christmas [Music] [Music] car praise the name of you know all those songs maybe we are going to dress like this maybe he's going to do like this and they sing but does it has no impact on their Liv praise the name of like I remember sometime years when we were young you know last night in some religion Jus at and then see drunking they come to your home but they drunk it has lost its meaning but Christ should be born in our lives let the life of Jesus Christ be reflected in Us Praise the name of that's what true Christmas is that the real Christmas the life of Jesus Christ being in me praise the name of Christ Living inside as brother BR must say he was born in a stable in a corrupt place and even us your heart condition Christ wants to be born there praise the name of our Lord he desires to be born right inside in your heart don't look at your condition you need say Lord I open the door of my heart come and be born in my heart come and Transform Me praise the name of like when some person came to Jesus and then they were asking Jesus where do you stay then he told them the birs they have nests the foxes they have holes but the son of man has nowhere to put his has he found a place to put his head he should come and put his head in my heart praise the name of our let him find a resting place let that be the dwelling place you know the Bible says in Luke 2:7 that they could not find room in the in the the the in was full how about our hearts what are our hearts full of praise the name of our what are our hearts full of if our hearts are full of things other than God let us remove those things and empty them we put them outside we clean our hearts and then we allow him to come and be born in our hearts he cannot be born in our hearts if they are full he cannot find room if the heart is full now in John chapter 14 praise the name of our Lord John chapter 14 and then verse 16 he says and I will pray the father and he will give you another comfor that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knows him but you know him for he dwelle with you and shall be in you he says the world cannot receive the world cannot accept the birth of Jesus Christ they cannot they have rejected it that's what shows that they have rejected but the things that they do wickedness drunkness all forms of evil have rejected the birth of Jesus Christ and then they come with something fake and give it to us that this is Christmas no Christmas Christmas is Christ being born in our heart praise the name of our that's the true Christmas just on remembering that he was born cannot deliver any person but accepting him in your heart will fulfill the purpose why he came praise the name of our Lord so he says the world cannot receive the world cannot accept that Jesus praise the name of they declare it by their action they immoral living they don't want to be born again they don't want to turn to God so they have rejected the true Christmas and what they have is a fake Christmas praise the name of our Lord you know traveling far country spend their time and say I'm going to celebrate my Christmas in the village but when you go there it is all over the and they have particular days for particular activi I think either 23rd that's when the pigs are Slaughter so you know if you want to get pork go on other on 24th you may not get it then they know on 24th that's when they kill animals like in our village many animals killed on the roation so they are obsessed in that not the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord and then some days it was about buying a new clothes finishing a project I need to enter my house in Christmas so somebody spends the whole week in the village without anything about God I said I cated my Christmas in the village the other day we bought crates of beer eating this wrting this fting this nothing about God just a fake Christmas praise the name of our Lord but true Christmas Christ has to be born in us the life of Jesus Christ has to be in Us Praise the name of the Bible say the world cannot accept it because it doesn't know him they have their own mind about Christ but not to receive the eternal life that Jesus Christ brought to us praise the name of our Lord so need to allow Christ to be born in our hearts and when Christ is born in our hearts he is alive on a daily basis and our Christmas is not only one day in the year but our Christmas is every day praise the name of our Lord every day we in Christmas why we have the proof the evidence that Christ has been born in our heart for those people they are look maybe looking at the history or what the media says or what the religious person says they have no proof that Jesus was born but when he's born in your heart then you know and have the proof that truly Jesus was born and is right born in my heart praise the name of our he's living inside of me so I don't wait for and say he was born and then the rest of the year you don't think he was born I can do what I want to do but when he's born in your heart praise the name of the Lord when you have a personal relationship with it doesn't matter where you go it doesn't matter what season you'll always confess him he has been born in my praise the name of our Lord let us go to Matthew Chapter 2 praise the name of our Lord and then we go to MTH chapter 2 and then we go to verse S okay let us start from verse one just Pi the whole story now when Jesus was born in bethleem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have Sinister IND the and are come to worship praise the name of our they said where is he born can you imagine somebody coming from East of kilom and then he comes to Jerusalem asking you what has happened in your place and you don't know that's the world we are living in and then the Bible says when Herod the king had these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him they were troubled they were wondering how can this be how this happen without our knowledge but there were a religiousity living in the in Jerusalem and the Bible says do not s by Jerusalem because Jerusalem is the city of the king the great king they were in the city of the king and they don't know that the king of the city has been born they didn't know they were blind the same condition that we see now is that people are blind to the reality praise the name of our came where is he where is he praise the name of our Lord and so car called thees and the priests and ask them where should the Messiah be born where should Christ the Messiah be born and the priests were able to go back to the scriptures and said in Bethlehem Judea praise the name of our Lord and when these three wise men had the scripture they followed the scripture and the scripture LED them to where Christ was by the leadership of the star these PRI these priests here they had the scripture but they couldn't see the star praise the name of the Lord the wise men s the and they came and had the scripture combined together it them where Christ was and people may have the scriptures but if they don't have the star they can never find him praise the name of our Lord but we have had the star the message of the hour bringing the scriptures to us and showing us Christ in our generation praise the name of our Lord Christ being revealed as the Son of God and that's what brings Life To Us Praise the name of our Lord so they they had the scripture but they never had the power of the script they never had light on the scrip so they had the scripture and they just stayed with the scripture but it couldn't bring transformation and that's what we need also to be careful we can have the scripture we can have the message books we can have the text praise the name of our Lord but without the spirit of God on them we are going to miss out on the Rapture praise the name of our the Bible says there were men in the days let us go to Luke Chapter 2 and then verse 25 and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just un devot waiting for consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord is Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in child Jesus to do him after the custom of the law then took him up in his arms and blessed God and said let Lord now let thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for I have seen thy salvation praise the name of Lord the Bible says Simeon was in Jerusalem but Simeon was totally different from the rest of Jerusalem the priests they knew the scriptures Herod had authority to ask what does the scripture say but then Simeon the Bible says he was waiting for the consolation of Israel just as we are waiting for the rupture we are waiting for the change of our body and then the Bible says he had the Holy Ghost upon him we also need to have the Holy Spirit right inside us Christ has been been born in us the new birth we have to be certain that we are born again that Christ dwells in the inside of us and then the Bible says the Holy Ghost revealed to him and the same holy spirit that dwells in us will reveal to us the rupture praise the name of our Lord will transform us will Quicken us to be raptured we should be different from the rest of the people praise the name of our Lord be different from the rest of the people praise the name of our Lord Jerusalem for them they were troubled but now to Simeon it was revealed to him he was delighted he was waiting for the consolation it's time to rejoice the time to worship and when the Holy Ghost came when Mary took Jesus on the eth day to be circumcised you know there were many children that were brought in the but the ho spirit is so definite is so precise that this is the child so Simeon he didn't go to Jerusalem and started asking where is a child born by a virgin woman is child he was definite praise the name of our you know just like see on television some of the ministers or preachers say somebody here is having headache but we all get headache then 10 people stand up that's not the Hest he was precise you sited there this is your problem the the Holy Ghost was using Brother BR in the ministry was precise exactly to the personing maybe it's the other one maybe it's the other one no praise the name of our God so we we have the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is definite in his work praise the name of our but Jerusalem the rest of them missed out in the Days of Elijah going to heaven the sons of the Prophet praise the name of they heard and they able to tell El that your master is going to be taken up to you know there there was the prophet and there also the sons of the Prophet just as we have the prophet and the son of the Prophet whom are you going to hear whom are you going to follow praise the name of our but elishah he did not follow the sons of the prophets eyes were on the prophet El that's why I laid the promise not on the sons of the Prophet praise the name of the Lord so it didn't matter what the sons of the Prophet were saying what the prophet was saying that's what we go with praise the name of the Lord if the prophet says there is the fivefold ministry we go with the prophet if the son of the Prophet says press and play that you go with the prophet what the prophet teaches is what has got power to transform praise the name of our so Elisha did not go by the son of the prophet he went by the prophet and that made him see the Rapture praise the name of our Lord and the son of the prophets Doctrine but didn't have power of transformation no wonder when elishah came back they the ones who said he has the spirit of Elijah but again they told El ah maybe has fallen up on certain Mountain they had the doctrine but they never had faith in the doctr don't bring a change in their lives praise the name of our Lord isn't the same thing of the rupture we canot the doctrine of the message but why is the power that transforms us to be part of the praise the name of our Lord that's why Christ has to be born in us when he is born in us he will show us this things he will reveal to us the things praise the name of the priests in MTH 2 they had the true doctr but who of the priests who went and worshiped Jesus when went there her who said I want to go and worship Herod is who said I want to go and worship but just wanted to kill but the priests they able to quot and give it to the people and left it there it has no transformation in but yet the three wise men when they received the truth they went out to go to Bethlehem then they start appear and they Rejoice praise the name of and we also need to be joyful it was such a happy day when Jesus took away my sin when Jesus was born in my what a happy day praise the name of now let us go in this message God's Gift always find their places he says and now watch these people this they brought him watch the gift they brought him identified what they thought he was praise the name of our Lord let us briefly go back to MTH chapter 2 and then in verse 11 let us start from verse 10 2 ver 10 and when they saw the St they Rejoice with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold Frank and Myra and now brother Bram says now watch what these symbols that I want to talk to you about what they mean now I've got some scripture wrote out here then he says now gold and Frank and now gold in the Bible how fitting it is to Christ because God speaks of Dy gold is D then frankon speaks of service and is death so now it is God D in service to die praise the name of the Lord see this when they came to worship they came with appropriate gifts praise the name of the greatest thing you can give to God is to give yourself to God praise the name of our Lord you surrender all your life and say Lord I'm giving all my life and when you give to God all your life the other things will seem nothing to you've given him all your life so if you have given him all your life your time to come to church when you give your life to God to come to church will not be a problem to you praise the name of the Lord why are we going to church on Wednesday morning I could have didn't make enough who life where have you given your life praise the name of but when you give all your life to God even your time Master it is yours you are the one who gives me time because the Bible says that God has determined on Earth let us go to Job chapter 14 praise the name of the Lord Job 14 and verse 5 seeing his days are determined the number of his mons are with you th has appointed his bound that he cannot pass that's the God we serve say the days are detered so what is that with giving him your time giving him your time to come to church giving him your time to pray giving him your time to read the word giving him your time to testify about his he says his days are with him what are you going to give to him praise the name of our Lord you know you have things praise the name of Lord but how much of those things you have are you putting into the use of the kingdom of yeah how much are you putting into the kingdom of God how much praise the name of our Lord or you want to accumulate accumulate accumulate ACC where are you going to take them what profit are you going to gain in them if you can't pick from what you have and put in the Kingdom because investing in the Kingdom is an eternal investment praise the name of our Lord is an eternal investment can say no let me pick what I have and put in the kingdom and then you see how God keeps on using you as a tributary but now if your blocks what comes it will not receive more praise the name of our Lord we should not be like the Dead Sea the Dead only receives it doesn't give out so it becomes dead no life in it when God said let the water bring the fish then your leg doesn't bring the fish no life there we shouldn't be like that we need to see that we give God all that we have your time your riches your body all that you have said Lord it is here for your praise the name of our Lord Lord it is here for your praise the name of our we need to be humble like the other man who own the other he had never sat on it he was careful to take it to to eat bring it back bring it back when the master had need of him he came for it praise the name of our Lord the same man with an upper house when the master needed told him the master want his last supper praise the name of in the Days of Elijah Bible says there were many widows in the Days of Elijah but now that widow woman her heart condition s about her and he sent there a Prophet and the more the widow woman supped the prophet the more she was sustained also that's the same thing the more we support the kingdom of God the more God supports us the more God cares for us the more God provides for us when others are crying you know my Lord is with me take care of me in every kind condition he will take care of me in every condition praise the name of so still in the message God's approprate gifts find their places he says and that's what he was God D in service to Die the very thing that they brought identified what they thought he was the same thing with us what do we think of Jesus Christ what think ye of Christ and how you think about him is how you act about him praise the name of the Lord and I said that to us today the things that we bring to him identifies what our thoughts is about him you understand what I mean see if you believe it with all your heart every word of that you'll identify it by giving all that you have to it but if you believe it is a good place to associate with better people around the church and things like that that's just about what you give just a few social hours with some congregation or something but but if you really believe it with all your heart then you give everything that is in you to it see it identifies you that you truly believe the message that you believe it to be the truth praise the name of our Lord so what you give reflects what what EXA you think about it praise the name of our Lord but we need to give our everything praise the name of our Lord to God blessed be the name of our Lord let us go to Colossians chapter 3 the Bible says verse one if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God so he says if you are risen with Christ if Christ is born in you all your heart is on the things that is where Christ is the Eternal things of the invis things of God they take most of your time they take most of your investment they take your commitment why because you are linked up with those things and then the Bible says where your Treasures are that's where your heart is if your Treasures are on the earth your mind will always be on the Earth so you guard it jealously but if the trees are in heaven then your heart will be there what more can I do for the kingdom of what more can I do for the services of Lord what will you have me to do praise the name of our you have that desire longing because of being identified with Christ so he says if we are risen with Christ we seek those things which are above where Christ Seth on the right hand of God now in Romans chter 14 praise the name of our Lord Romans chapter 14 and then we'll read in verse okay sorry Romans chapter 14 just I beg your pardon let me get the scripture here let us read verse 17 for the kingdom of God is Not meat and [Music] drink but the kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost praise the name of our Lord so if we say we have been born again if we say we in the kingdom of God there should be righteousness there should be peace in us there should be joy in Us Praise the name of our Lord if I didn't get the that doesn't trouble you you just God I would have spent recklessly but it's going to come I have a better work for it praise the name of Lord the other day on Monday we passing through Bara and the line on the banks praise the name you know now supposing you go there and there's no money going to do you just get troubled but just Cal down that's not the kingdom of God not eaten any meat but you've been [Laughter] eting so he says it is not meat and drink but righteousness it is something which are Eternal and brother Bram says the Eternal things you can't buy them with money has really given them to us so you are always happy rejoicing in the Lord praise the name of our let us go to Second Timothy chapter second Timothy Chapter 2 second Timothy Chapter 2 and then the Bible says verse 22 F also useful last but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart he says follow F the things of the world leave them but follow righteousness charity peace with all the people call God out of a pure heart so he says if we are risen with Christ let us do things that are above we seek them we desire them righteousness Lord I want to have your righteousness PE Lord I want to have your peace in my joy Lord I want to have joy in my then the Bible says fa I want to have the fa of God faith of Jesus Christ those should be the things that bring us joy contentment not what I've eaten on Christmas what I've wor Christmas it should not be that but it should be Lord I want you to be found alive in my house prise the name you know the the three wise men when they were moving around they asking where is he born King of the where is he born king of Je and the world is asking the same question where is he born King of the Jews you should have the answer now is born in my heart praise the name of inside of me said are you sure yes can you prove it his life comes out the love of God the peace of God the faith of God the righteousness of God the goodness of God the joy of God why he is born in my heart praise the name of our Lord and then you become a fountain that flows out peace flows out of Joy flows out you know you know meekness flows out patience flows out why he right inside here he has been born in me ask where is he he's here praise the name of we should have the answer to that question where is he born King of the Jews is inside here don't start looking for him elsewhere but he right inside what the scripture say the world does not see him neither can receive him but you see him you are going to receive it and is going to be new that scripture should be fulfilled in our lives he's inside of me so I am with him because he's in me praise the name of let us go back to Colossians 3 and verse 2 3: 2 he says set your affection on the things above not on the things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God verse four when Christ who is our life praise the name of our it's no longer I but it is Christ that lives in me he has been born in me praise the name of our Lord I have received the true Christmas gift true Christmas is alive in me praise the name of Lord he says Christ who is our life while the rest of them are looking at history and then some of them who can afford they have got good money and have made pilgrimage to Bethlehem so they moving to those places I'm ring there when Easter comes they also want to carry the cross and then you get them almost in every town carrying the cross on Good Friday Friday no life in those things no life in Asia I'm just forgetting the country they even get crucified crucified like Christ in that praise the name of our but he's here to be born in US freely to be born in us just Lord accept you as my person obey the word and then you see the life transforming Christ in you and the Bible says Christ who is our life not my own life now my own life died now it is Christ that and then the Bible says when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory that's in the rupture when he appears he appears with him in glory the same Glory that he has praise the name of our then verse fivey Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection andness which is idolatry it says make them dead and let Christ become alive in us praise the name of our Lord now in the message life he says now the Christian church should have the real character there and if the Life of Christ is in the Church of Christ then it is good to have the character of Christ praise the name of the Lord it will produce the Life of Christ it is just no more than just what he call in the of Common Sense if the Life of Christ if the life of the spirit of Christ is in the church it has to produce that life because the life that's in you makes your character and what kind of characters we allow to be who have Solly promised that we would serve the Lord Jesus as long as we live and we have been baptized to his death burial Resurrection praise the name of God so we need to have the character of Jesus Christ through Christmas christ living in Us Praise the name of our Lord and that should always be our desire every day Lord Liv ins Lord change me praise the name of our Lord when you make something wrong you realize there is the comforter there is the advocate there is the blood of Jesus and you bring your sin in the blood of Jesus chist and you continue moving praise the name of now let us go to this message God's rupt gift he says where into the East and many hundreds of miles away from there the maggies was already on their Road know the the people who watch the Stars you know they watch from far and they can interpret the meaning of the St and then brother Bram in a certain message he says they were reading the book of Daniel because Daniel was in those areas and so he wrote so now they were following the and then he says here they seen his stand and was coming to worship God's little gift package that he was sending to the world just a little while from then and the world was going to receive its greatest gift that it ever received a little package wrapped up first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world God wrapped it up then he says I want to break it on my thought and say this the greatest thing that was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it God himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the world praise the name of our so the rupt gift of God it was in the flesh Christ being born in a manger he was not being born in high places he was born in a despised place he was born in in a poor family he was born by people who came from a despised Place God wrapped the gift and he says God himself wrapped it praise the name of and right now God even now is wrapping himself In the Flesh has God dropped himself in your flesh praise the name of the unveiling of Christ Christ should be in us and should unveil himself praise the name of our Lord when they see your good works then they will glorify the father who is in heaven God should be wrapped in US praise the name of our Lord just as he was wrapped in Christ and Christ was the greatest Christmas then he says why did they refuse it why couldn't they see it why did they turn it down why is it they didn't want it the same reason they don't want it tonight it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were used to gifts being handed that's the reason it's rejected is because it's not handed to the people in the custom that they have been used to receiving praise the name of our Lord so they rejected it because it came in a way they wouldn't expect but was the way God wanted it R so true Christmas we need to have Christ born in Us Praise the name of our in Galatians 4: 19 Galatians 4:19 he says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you praise the name of our Lord until Christ be formed in you that's what we should desire every other day Lord be formed in my life like the song that has been sung by faith and Ruth let him be born in the M of my heart that's the true Christmas christ being born in our lives praise the name of and you know brother Bram has told us he was born in a stable in a corrupt place so what condition are you in that Christ cannot be born in your what condition it's all your heart's attitude it's all about you saying Lord I'm here come and be born in my praise the name of our Lord look at the other prostitute when she heard that Jesus was at Simon the Pharisees house she came herself she gave all herself to her hair her yes everything she had which was she put it under the feet of Jesus and then Jesus told her your sins which are many are forgiven she was justified so it doesn't matter the condition of somebody's heart all it needs all God wants from us accept him receive him and then you see his life working out in praise the name of our let that life work out to bring a power of transformation praise the name of the message of the hour is an Open Door to Salvation it's not a closed door it's an open Open Door praise the name of our Lord and the doors are open he's still calling come unto me your Heaven L and I will give you rest praise the name of our Lord so there should be nothing that should hinder you for christ being born in you praise the name of our Lord nothing should hinder you you just say Lord here I am be born in my heart Transform Me praise the name of our Lord now in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and then read verse 21 as I try to wind up praise the name of our Lord 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and then verse 21 the Bible says sorry verse yes for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead praise the name of our Lord it says the first Adam brought death the second Adam brings resurrection and life praise the name of our Lord and by our first bir we came from the first Adam by the second birth we come from the second Adam now you see in verse 22 for as in Adam all die says in Adam all die every one of us all have seen and have come short of the glory of but Christmas he says but in Christ all shall be made alive you should be among that all shall be made alive praise the name of our so don't allow your condition to put you out but whatever condition is in bring it to the master praise the name of until the master Lord have not yet received true Christmas I need true Christmas that will make me answer Christ is born in me praise the name of Christ is born in my heart and that should be always our desire that we live I'm living for Christ I've set my affection on the things about so I'm not bothered whether I have good Christmas today or have a new cloth or have worked on the hair or have new shoes or I've got a new home or whatever thing oh my plans have been fulfilled the whole year the thing is is Christ Living in me when Christ is in you that is the true Christmas praise the name of our and our Christmas is daily not one day so you rejoice every day praise the name of the Lord You're not troubled your heart is settled when Simeon so the Lord is Christ he said let your servant go in peace praise the name of the Lord and Paul all those apostles who are not afraid of anything why Christ was born in them until Paul said going to be with the Lord is very important to me but be on this body helps the people he was ministering praise the name of our Lord had that kind of shity assurance that Christ lives inside of praise the name of Lord and that should be our desire every day the Bible has told us let us seek those things about the Life of Christ to be changed to be transformed and be ready for the rupture praise the name of our so you have the through Christmas praise the name of our Lord I'm a witness I'm a witness that I have the true Christmas by the life of Jesus chist may God bless you amen amen as the song leader comes sing that song know you not you are [Music] temp KN not no know you are the temple no
