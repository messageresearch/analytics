don't let him go until he gives you a new name not Jacob now but Israel amen let's stand up the scripture reading this word of prayer precious Heavenly Father we have a desire we don't want to go back the same where we came we seek for a blessing not for material blessing but a blessing that will change our character we pray that you may come down that you may break The Way We Walk that father you may change the name not supplant anymore but princess with god father may your presence perform signs wonders and miracles to may you comfort them that are discomforted this morning may you give Revelation father to your children especially the revelation of who Thou Are we pray for a blessing of your presence in Jesus name amen amen so we shall go to Genesis chapter 27 and verse you are all welcome to the house of the Lord bless you brother Juma and all of you Brothers God bless you so much thank you for making it here amen verse 8 now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which I command thee th now re talking to Jacob go now to the flock and fetch me from then two good kids of the Gods and I'll make them sever meat for thy father such as he loveth and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death may the Lord add blessing to the reading of the word amen will you obey the voice of your mother today let's be seated so we are in our series uh preaching stability and I'm taking the third part the title of the third part is rea the mother of Jacob Rebecca the mother of Jacob now brother Bram speaks so much about church motherhood by pointing at Rome the mother Church to the organizational setup mother of Hots and all Abominations of the Earth but in the kingsman Redeemer he gives us another concept about church in terms of motherhood and let us pull that quote out from the kingsman Redeemer brother Bram says the old church is a mother to the new church when he's talking about the old church he's talking about Israel being the mother of the new church and the new church is the New Testament Gentile church but the mother who here is the Christian the Christian a Believer are you together with me so I spoke about the word made flesh and that's where the foundation of a churches that's the revelation of Christ the church amen I I want to say something here that it must be the word made flesh upon which the church is built now and I want to say this that it was an individual Revelation upon which Christ builds his church he doesn't build on an organization he builds on you because the Jews God worked with them as a nation they would fall as a nation and then they would be restored as a nation but when it comes to you God is dealing with you person and when he says upon that church I build my I mean upon that Revelation I'll build my church and the gats of hell shall not Prevail he's actually talking about you as an individual because when you see Christ and I see Christ and then we come together we are a church founded on Revelation but by matter of individual being made Word Flesh amen so he says the old church is a mother to the new church the Christian a Believer so now in this form of motherhood God is picking individuals among the Gentiles amen so he says don't go to another [Music] field that's now when it's talking to uh to to uh to Ruth he say stay right in this field and maybe someday you might find Grace with me so when we come to this point here we said that the church that God is speaking about is not your individual local church no the church is speaking about is totally different he's speaking about the invisible body of the Lord Jesus Christ are you together with me so that's why he says don't STG from the word don't stuggle from the blessing don't stuggle from the baptism that made you part of the church are you together with me we shall make it clear as we go so the old church meaning the Old Testament Israel the Old Testament Israel is the mother to the new test church and single out as an individual believer being that church so I wanted to find an angle of emphasizing Church motherhood other than the concept and so I want to draw the concept of motherhood from that that's why I call this service today Rebecca the mother of Jacob so God commits similar sacred virtues to the woman that is spiritually commits to the church the VES the sacred virtues that he places to the church spiritually he desires to see them in a woman natur amen so in the message in Vis Union brother Bram says what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a responsibility to her motherhood or to have [Music] virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to Christ just the same as the woman have a woman has a sa Trust are you together with me now they are natural but the church the same trust is spiritual so that the woman could be a natural type of the type of the I mean of of the church so and brother Bram says I'm speaking to her character around not letting every man amen so I want to repeat what brother Bram says I speaking to her conduct her character around men not allowing every man you know a sister shouldn't allow every man around her because she has to protect that sacred motherhood which God gave her she doesn't open herself for every man that's why Rome is the mother of harot and Abominations of the she opened up the word L it means god and the word sh means the breath so God is El in a sense like the weak and the need child would go to the mother and nurse for life El Abraham and sarahah were n on that attribute of el and they became young again and then brought forth life now I do not know how old you feel I don't know how spent you feel how spent you know many times the enemy tells you Z of your Christian Life and yet you feel weak that's when you need hallelujah hallelujah that's when you need to come and on the gifts that God has put in the church hallelujah hallelujah the church is for the weak let the weak say am strong and let them take a step back and be able to on the gift that the Holy Ghost puts in the church oh Hallelujah rea the mother of Jacob it doesn't matter how weak Jacob is ration he said by the side of his mother Hallelujah and the mother said my wife can you imagine now when the Holy Ghost comes in the church and uses the GI to speak [Music] to in is hallelujah hallelujah and Jacob takes everyone but the Holy Ghost speaks by the five hallall yes sir the church is here instruct Jacob Divine approach to [Music] God are you together with yeah we need to be guided Rebecca was there Rea knew the position of Jacob amen that position is not for praise God yes sir and God has given us the church amen where we can exercise our positions in [Music] Christ we are preaching stability Rebecca Rea Jacob's mother Hallelujah for one by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and become partakers of The Same Spirit that's in the blood cell the church is wrapped into the blood cell of the life of Jesus Christ and he lives in his church through the blood of his sacrifice so The Church on the Rock therefore you know has been given the benefits of Revelation when you get the Revelation when Christ reveals himself to you it doesn't remain in your mind because the Revelation I'm talking about is not your understanding of the godhead but when the person of the Lord Jesus Christ has come over to you and changed your name from Jacob to Israel means he has changed your character amen and so what he did he broke the fire amen of Jacob so that the way he walks they reflect the change that God had given him and the people said he's now lame he went back a poor young man but if he has come very rich but what I see is he cannot even walk I wouldn't like riches when I'm a lame man let the people say what they want he used to be very smart but now that is a Believer look at what he looks like he's not enjoying his wealth he doesn't go to this night club anymore let them say what they she used to be a nice lady she was mod but look at the dresses what they comment on you is the testimony of new amen stand with the new revelation let them say what they say but thank God that you are not what you used to be when God gives a revelation it comes with Benefits because that Revelation is life in itself let's go to Matthew 16 and verse let's be humble and God will Lift Us in due time amen amen you see I'm preaching stability and that's what we need in the churches today the churches have got a total understanding of Doctrine but they cannot stand strong why that's what we are addressing and I'll will take maybe this Warrior trying to help the church to find stability Matthew [Music] 1618 and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this Ro I build my church and the gods of Hell shall not Prevail against Now The Rock was not Peter The Rock was the Revelation that Peter got okay of who the Christ was so Verse 18 is a Church on the Rock holding together the sacred virtue amen and therefore no G of Hell could Prevail against her why because when she gets the revelation of who this Christ is it comes with Benefits there's no way you can be a Church on the Rock unless you hold those sacred VES those sacred virtues are the life of testimony that you have set your foot on the Rock Amen amen so Sac motherhood a womb for one PLT to the word and amen you get the Keys of the Kingdom to bind and lose meaning the devil cannot stand before you you got the keys to buy and amen you must know that by breaking into the revelation of this Christ God would release Divine authority to bring the kingdom of Satan to her KN amen are you together with me the Devil Comes down and kneels down to the presence of the church because when you got the keys that's like Christ himself amen first you have the keys to the kingdom to bind and close what's holding you this morning you have the right to buy and to [Applause] lose you've got the authority it was given to you recognize who thou then let's go to John chapter 20 here and verse 21 then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father sent me even so you the same way Jesus comes he was given the father's Authority and Jesus said I also hand my authority given to me by the father to the church what Jesus was able to do the church is able to do where Jesus would B the church would buy where Jesus would lose the church would lose believest thou [Applause] this praise the Lord yes sir we are [Music] commissioned under the same Authority and the same anointing Amen to buy and even open the kingdom for the people it's not God opening anymore the keys were given to the church the benefits of Revelation amen so verse 22 here and when he had said this he breathed on them and potentially gave them the Holy Ghost and he says unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now let me explain it like this when this Earth was created the seeds were already in the Earth on creation and he only said let every kind bring I mean let every tree bring forth of its SK let every seed bring forth of each sky where was the seed in the ground and he say receive the Holy Ghost potentially the Holy Ghost had come upon them when they went to the upper room that was the manifestation in the presence of the Holy Ghost receive ye the Holy Ghost as my father said so send your now let me say potentially you have the Holy Ghost but you are just clearing way for the Holy Ghost to manifest himself in your life because it's the holy ghost in your justification amen you can't justify yourself it's the holy ghost in your sanctification you can sanctify yourself and finally the Holy Ghost will be made manifest let me say again receive you the Holy Ghost amen stand in Channel because there is a man who can turn on the light and then the darkness that tries to crowd the Holy Ghost will give way and you bring forth the fruits of his presence amen amen hallelujah hallelujah receive you the Holy Ghost amen and we take out those are benefit in verse 23 says whoever sins ye remit brother whoever youit God bless whoever SE did you know that you are remitters of sin and the people go to the Roman Catholic priest you know these people are very smart they know that when you do something terrible it haunts you forever but they tell you you can never be forgiven until you've confessed to the to the priest and they said the Holy Ghost comes upon the father that whatsoever you confess when he Le the confession box when he the confession box he has forgotten so you say you remember that bank rob which [Music] I'm the one who had hooded my head and I was shooting around oh Father for we took about 200 million shs God forgive you my son truth and then he hears that you are going away son do you remember what you told God and your sin was forgiven you start going back immediately you understand what I mean but we can genuinely remit people's sins how do we do that by giving the people the word when you the word is the washing Waters the blood I mean the word is the blood because the word was the original blood cell amen that was spoken into the womb of a virgin and brought forth a son and when the son went to the Cross he was able to pour that blood and now his life went back in the blood I mean into Spirit again amen that's where he is and he's the word so when the word is spoken that's the blood will you remit people's sins how will you do it by living the life amen and two by preaching the word you remit the people see amen you were given that Authority why don't you try listen that don't cover I'm speaking about Rebecca Jacob's mother listen now notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but also to impart eternal life to [Applause] Believers hallelujah hallelujah but when the people believe the what they want is to perform sence to have power to heal the se but the Greater Works is to give spiritual eternal life to people and God gave this life to the church you cannot preach away Church you cannot act away Church no sir there is a lot that God intended to do within Church framework amen praise the Lord so the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary it took St degenerated men amen and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the SI and to impact eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and imp [Music] part spiritual eternal life he was a robber but today he can impact because he has received the Holy Ghost he can speak the word God can anoint it so church is a very important place and spiritually speaking it is the body of Christ Church but be you know very careful that no spirit will turn you away from church amen amen so by coming to this Tabernacle here you are coming into fellowship with manifold attributes of the Holy [Applause] Ghost and some of these attributes are held by prayerful men sons that have come to their adoption amen because a gift is a position I mean is a portion of God which has been given to [Applause] you are you together with me that's what a gift is God just gets a little bit and gives it to you so I am God's gift to you as you are God gift to me so when we come together everybody is under [Applause] and when you come to church we are having Fellowship of attributes some of these attributes have found their adoption they have gone away from Foolish Games they know how to pray they car the anointing and sometimes when you come into Fellowship the man just shakes your hands the attribute of God SL and causes something into your life you may never know it but that's the way God works amen praise the Lord you come to church it's a fellowship of attributes so we bring lots of pillars of together in a conversation somebody can say something and speak healing into your body amen they can bless you by a general statement God bless you it comes from the heart and right there and then you begin to find favor with God amen church is a called out group of people and is also home and it is also home of the fullness of the Holy Ghost Amen brother Bram says that the fullness of the goded B is now in the church because you are the body of Christ members in particular you are members of the body by a portion of the Holy Spirit God so the church together is the fullness of the godhead body amen now the son of man the son of man the place to lay his the other time Jesus said Son of Man has no where to but today the church is the place where the son of man be a to Hallelujah when you come to church you are not coming to a party you are not coming to a social Gathering you are coming to divine presence of the almighty God now are you the body of Christ and members in particular church is the house of teaching and that's where we are educated on how to relate with the father a church is the mother of Jacob teaching jaob approach to go and receive your inheritance from the father yes sir that's where [Applause] station he never misses any special service know this is the time when God is going to unfold himself was calling him a little keeping on his mother's lap but that's how he learned how to approach the father Divine [Music] approach we have heard the word all the time 30 years now it doesn't require you to go to church every you are [Applause] joking you can as well stay home and listen to step you're missing something let me tell you that's an es anointing that's ano I have a direct approach to the father you know I can pray like a Cornelius and Angels come down but God sent Cori back to the [Applause] church are you together with me yes sir rea the mother of Jacob come on let us drop all the anointing all the time around the mother around the when will you grow when will you what matters is the father what matters and go to the father I've even gone there and he has told me he wants to bless Hallelujah hallah but the one who stand around the mother knew how to extract the blessing the gift of divine approach was given to the church Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers in church we exercise how to live in the Kingdom the kingdom is not going to be a lonely Place un of [Applause] Brotherhood amen the preaching of the word brings his presence and the working of Miracles brings his presence and when you come you would say I would like to approach God some says well now how they approach it come his provided approach those are words of brother brother you cannot have your own way you have to come by the provided approach so by order the new birth belong to but Jacob loved the bir right better and he was born pulling the heel of his brother I must go before you and when he was born Jacob spent all his time around the church to learn how to take take that blessing was more of Al Al lonely much as he loved his father but the gift that taught Divine appro where the place of wisdom was was with Rebeca Church there is something you miss when you detach yourself from church you develop attitudes you lose the spirit of love you become a Critic because that's what separates you from church you are better than everybody else is true but the is true but the secret of divine approach has been given to the church are you together with me it has been given to the church that's where the gifts are to perfect the Saints [Music] so that they can have Divine approach to God it's not with you alone in your services is not with you alone in overnight prayers you can be praying every day listening to steps every day studying the books every day but there is something you miss if you are not given to your mother [Applause] Hallelujah are you together with me you don't stay home when there is an assembly of the Saints and anybody that encourages you to stay home doesn't love you and doesn't want you to come to [Applause] inheritance amen amen okay Ephesians 4:11 and he you know when he was talking about the talent he says that he gave his talent those talents were not for the people that received them but the talents of approach were given by God to the church and to the Ephesians Paul is calling them gifts ministerial gifts amen they are not given it to one man and even if you are very gifted and you are yourself how can you ify [Applause] yourself preach to yourself evangelize to yourself there is something wrong amen amen Ephesians 4 and he gave some not he gave all but in the entire church he gave son and the will help others perfect and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and some pastors and teachers you could be highly gifted but you are not everything Jacob needs a mother otherwise he will not come to a god ordained position in the body Jacob needed a mother you need a mother you need a church if you have understood that say amen amen amen okay questions and answers you say well glory to God the Bible say when the Holy Ghost is come you don't need any teacher he's the teacher himself oh brother how can you be so little from reading this scripture why did the Holy Ghost say teachers in the church then so what does this mean the Holy Ghost being a teacher is because he has given you the teacher that's how the Holy Ghost is the teacher he speaks inspiration needed for a season and then gives it to the people amen so you say I you you say I don't have anybody teach me the Holy Ghost teaches me it does through a teacher he said teachers in the church he said are all teachers are all pastors are all gifts of healing the ho God set these gifts in the church he operates them and each one of them operates [Applause] [Music] orderly are you together with me he says they operate orderly even a pastor will need the gift of an apostle gift of a teacher he cannot be everything so these gifts must have a field to work in a church body a people and they must these gifts must have restor to the faith of Malachi so when computers lose their normal programming I cannot say this in the presence of Silas and brother Henry and the rest of you [Laughter] computer you see but you know sometimes they lose their programming du to viruses but when you remit or you you you delete the virus normally these computers are given a restoration [Music] point you just restore to this default Point are you together with me even when your phone has goneway you have got a restor point manufacturer restoration Point are you together with me so all of us in this age we have been given a restoration point the message of Malachi 4 God has sent us a prophet that's our restoration point every question has been brought down to the restoration Point behold I send you Elijah the before the coming of the great and rightful of and he shall restore the hearts of the fathers their children and the children I mean to their fathers he Resto amen he rest the apostolic to the church he rest the church to the life within that doctr he brings to the church back to the first love you together with me we are being restor amen we go back to the original Pentecostal Doctrine amen yes sir he says in church for in each age the church goes astray and it's not just the L but the CL group shepherds are WR as well as sheep then God brings himself on the scene as as the chief shepher in the ministries of these seven men meaning The Messengers to lead these people back to the truth and abant power of that truth so this is how God does things all the fivefold ministers and the later are [Music] reform by the Min of Mal Hallelujah the ministry is not this no but they are reformated Hallelujah and that's what we've been doing going to all these other brothers don't tell them stop but we tell them be reformated back to the Mal position and then begin to go forward amen praise the Lord are you together with me praise God are you reformated brother here reform brought back apost there you are reform brought back to what God is doing this don't sneak in with the wild gods [Applause] [Applause] amen because the people know what they want to be they cry and they say man of God man of God there is death in the p are you together don't mix keep the word [Applause] pure keep the church touch don't throw denomination seed in it amen so we are given five Ministries these men are gifts to the church the men themselves are the gift these men here don't make themselves but these men ordained of God to be what they are so the one who fights to get in there is not part of it God when he calls you he organizes a position for you so he has got five offes Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teacher and Ephesians 42 he tells us why he caus this men he says for the perfecting of the for the work of the ministry for the Edy of the body of Christ not for destroying the body but for edifying body that whatever we say and do must be seen to edify the body so as fivefold ministers we have three Commissions in church but generally that is to put the church together brother Bram in the message Faith cometh by here he says but that is it friends God s some in the church to dramati some to preach fire sermon others to pray for the sick but all these gifted Brothers they are in the church for one purpose that's to unite the kingdom of God here on Earth the [Applause] Brotherhood that's why we are here to put the body together so as a minister whatever you do let it put the body together if there is anything in me which tends to destroy the body God forbid God didn't call us to do that any word I say which can break the body God be merciful it can put me on a higher level but it will not help me because it doesn't help the body [Applause] [Music] we are all called to keep this body [Applause] together amen amen I know you could come yesterday and you are very anointed you can preach the roof down and then you start saying that one has he done more than what I've done for us we've been we go there we go there where does he go he goes only at one place God have mercy God have mercy we need to respect the pillars of the faith which God has used he calls them I'll make you a pillar in the house of God you may not be aware but when you break a pillar you might bring a lot of Destruction I want to say this by the grace of God God has made me a pillar in the house of the Lord you break it you destroy the work of God every one of us we need to respect the principles so three things the first thing for the perfecting of the Saints and these Saints here means Sanctified ones humanly we men in the ministry there's nothing we can do other than just supplying the materials of purification amen just like you know it was in the days of EST you know made sure that she uses the materials of purification the Church of Corinth could have been filthy Wicked evil they eat things sacrificed to Idols but when PO is addressing he says called to be Saints and they went a long distance to bring that testimony are you together with me they were doing all kinds of silly things but in all the entire churches that Paul worked with there is no church which received greater Revelations like the Church of they received Revelations about the change of our bodies they received Revelations of Paul going beyond the they received Revelations about the change of our bodies they receive Revelations of how the son will give the throne back to the father there are so many great things in that book that will never been revealed to thees we are not here to call judgment upon you because you are still young and you are moving in a way that's not praiseworthy what I know you are called hallelujah hallelujah stay with your stay with that teaching with the gifts see what [Applause] God praise God so the work here is to fish not to to f or to equip the things necessary for the journey so God just using the spiritual vision for the ministry to identify what the bride needs in season and the minister goes into prayer goes into study what does the people of God need and then this man here comes with food in season amen we thank God that by the grace of God for almost 40 years now we are feeding on food in SE that's perfecting the Saints give them some when you see they hungry in a certain way you going a different way give them some are you together with me yes sir and then you get testing tips amen but I will not tell you okay the second thing for the work of the ministry amen like baptizing the people waiting the couples standing in the ministry of the world not body will do that God has separated men for the work of the ministry so the work of the ministry means that in the economy of God he has set apart men that he has consecrated for service this also happened in the Church of Moses when he consecrated amen Aon and his son them aside for the work of the ministry Moses wased them amen and then dressed them differently consecrated them and also anointed them amen God just sets them apart they are not like the rest not just trying to lift ourselves up but there is something God has done for the ministry amen and Paul looking at the burden of the ministry the weight of the ministry he say such men deserve a Double H not because they want to be special you become a minister and you taste the soup a little bit brother James has Ted the soup a little bitp the soup are you together with me yeah there's pressure that goes the way you handle these men is an encouragement for them pray for them these are men consecrated for the pit Ministry to Edy not threaten you no but edify brother Bram said a false prophet will keep the People by threatening them but A God Called man he knows how to keep the people in them I told the church the other day on our chat room that you see this time here at the pulpit is not enough if you can't keep the people some people will Pastor them remotely Pastor them remotely on chat rooms on X and Twitter as they call it they listen more to other ministers but they are not giving you what you need they give you what they know and sometimes what's important for their places but when the Samaritan finds a wounded man he takes in that area there's a reason why God put you here Ephesians 4:13 the testimony of the ministry first of all the ministry identified their work identified but then 13 is the testimony of the ministry if the ministry has done a good work verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God after a perfect man amen after the measure of the St of the fullness of Christ will come to the unit of the faith Amen to the point where PA says let us all say the same thing amen and the unity of the spirit must go before us to bring us to the unity of the of the faith the unity of spirit let us be one don't be antagonistic be part of the church family that's the unity of spirit it will give a minister the Peace of Mind bring you to the unity of Faith amen because the unity of spirit looks beyond our history I will look beyond our groupings looking towards the Oneness of the mind and Faith to the knowledge of the Son of God not son of man now that Son of God which Son of God has to do with the Redemption that may salvation bring me into the power of the Resurrection that we may know him hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen till we come to the knowledge of the son of God [Applause] that there is a testimony of the new birth among the people the knowledge of the Son of God Amen not son of man Son of God to bring us to a perfect and this Perfection is not a sinless Perfection but rather being called compl am hallelujah praise God and for you to be complete and perfect praise God yes sir to bring you to the perfect man that means they've supplied the presence of the blood which is the washing Waters of the world you know how to put your sin under the blood the nature of the heart is broken and contr the character of Christ being iminent perfect man is one that has all it takes to make the Rapture and also lives in the life of what he has for the journey amen he has come to the measure of the stat of a perfect man the fullness of Christ and wanting nothing hallelujah hallelujah is not going to run here and there he's looking for nothing did you hear that he's not looking for nothing in the setting of the church is the fivefold minister that moved from and fromus to Philippi is not the people that we're running from church to church is the minister that works the people but today people are running back and forth what are they looking for and we call it Revival but verse 14 Ephesians 4:14 I'm preaching stability be humble but you are never in church today you are in this one tomorrow you in that one tomorrow you are the other one and every the one bringing greetings I bring greetings from Brothers here I bring greetings from this way I bring greetings from that [Music] way be part of the church Ephesians 4:4 that we henceforth be no more children TOS to and fr and carried about with every wind of dark by the Slate of menning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive preaching stability not blown by [Music] WIS craftiness most people are blown blown by this wind for failing to know that church is not a holy Place hallelujah hallelujah re the mother of Jacob not the mother of Joseph now but the mother of Jacob R but he knew that when I stay here my weakness will be dealt with and when my weakness is held God give me the grace amen amen so many people don't know that church is not a holy place because in there are Renegades and all but that's where the spirit moves brings down sanctification Hallelujah in the beginning in the beginning God created heavens and earth and it was vo and darkness was upon the of the but the spirit of God moved upon the Hallelujah I know we have some Darkness I know we have some void here but the spirit of God is continuing to move on the so that he can bring for a beautiful garden [Applause] of went to say Amen Let there be life Hallelujah hu and when he says Let There Be oh Hallelujah then the seeds which were hidden in your Darkness will begin to come forth and you will be a g [Music] of those who do not know how God deals with the church they begin to point at the darkness but why you are here is because you came for light you didn't come here to remain in darkness you came here to shine the light in church we gather with people of similar purpose to be encouraged on that single Purpose By A people that God has ordain to help guide the church even local area and there cannot be a church without these men Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelist every one of those five but in the local setup God bles the pastor as the spiritual head of the church and this pastor here is supported by a an Administration Groupons Tres Sunday school teachers amen and brother Bram says the pastor is the highest order in the church the Elder is the highest thing in the Apostolic Church outside of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit brings his message the Elder and the Elder gives it to the people amen and that's what I am doing this morning because the seed comes by the body hallelujah hallelujah when you are out there you are waiting for voices but we are not in that time we are in the time where God has put on a body and he ministers by the gifts the seed comes by the body and that's what I am doing this morning corus you are way out there seriously praying but when the angel comes down he'll advise you to go back to the church s j there is a man called Peter that is church there is this man here the UN he in study of the word completely confused because he not a teacher when you stay there in your it doesn't mean you understand you get a lot of confusion but the gift is given to the teacher Philip and join [Applause] yourself Rebecca Jacob's mother listen here brother Bram says remember God's law of reproduction now remember after its kind amen okay then it says the seed of Christ the word must come through his body hallelujah hallelujah must come through his body and body is not one man it's the church he continues to say here seed is through the body and the church is the body of Christ the Bible Church this bath produces himself in a body his church his word so that people can see the confirmation of Hebrews 138 amen so Church Must Be to away to approach God it's the mother of Jacob and Jacob was a uh hang around his mother little old siss boy but he knew that Rebecca was one body with Isaac she was the Bing ground of life she was Isaac's storage of life she was Isaac's womb hallelujah hallelujah the separation of Adam and Eve when God pulled Eve out of Adam he just removed the womb and separated it to bring forth SE Jacob in his weakness he knew that he was a little crook but he sat under the ministry of Rebecca long enough understand the value of the B right and he hang right in there he knew what he wanted to be and he attended every service with unhindered his he paid his offerings he had respect for all the instruments of service in the church the pastors all the ministers the deacons the trustees considered himself a part of the body by the grace of you are not called to condemn yourself you are called to come into presence that will make you what you want to [Applause] be amen he always looked forward to the day when Jacob would become isra amen oh yes sir the rest for you know uh it rested that kind of Desire rested in the Deep unconscious since he had that battle with his brother he remembers somehow somewhere when I was being born I pull that up I don't know why are you always dream that I'll be better than this do you have that dream hallelujah hallelujah that you are going to be better than what you are are you dreaming today that somehow somewhere I don't know how it will come but I will lay a hold of my inheritance do you have that dream despite the condition you are in despite the battles you are fighting you shall make the statue of a perfect Hallelujah that's the vision of Jacob and when God saw the character and commitment of Ja to Rebecca the path of life he made a way for him to step in his adoption as a son Jacob have I loved but es have I hated Hallelujah he came first I don't love him I love he said the desire of Jacob what is your desire this morning what's your desire this morning Hallelujah God has place the gift to the spiritual eternal life in your local church the Keys of the Kingdom have been given to the church keep buying the oil amen from the sellers in your local church keep filling your life amen praise God that's what you need to do let me tell you the Holy Ghost did come to Joseph the Holy Ghost comes to Jacob to make him Joseph Hallelujah the Lord Jesus came not to save The Righteous he came to save Sinners if you feel a failure if you feel a sin today church is your right place Hallelujah when you feel weak chch is your right place hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah re of church bringing for anding him Perfection J is Bor amen listen now on the day of Pentecost eternal life shows residence into people that were exactly the nature of Jacob there was nothing good about them these are men who had doubted the res these are men who had even gone back to their fishing praise God so God joined himself to those body and yet they were having living of unbelief in them are you together with them but God joined himself on them on the day of Pentecost amen because on the day of Pentecost in the Old Testament the two loaves in the fast of [Music] Pentecost and Liv was negative but that Feast was pointing to the day of P when God in his Perfection would come to the imperfect and start a work of seven churches to bring forth a perfect [Music] church amen amen hallelujah hallelujah he did not come to a perfect church but we thank God for the sacrifice now when the two loaves were on the of P they had to be waved together with sacrif for them to be holy praise God do you know friends all of you you are perfect in the eyes of God do you know that today you are being waved together with Christ the sacrifice amen the gift in Rebecca should teach Jacob the Divine approach to God Church the mother of Jacob that's what I'm here for that there is great in the midst of us to teach us Divine approach to possessing our inheritance so we need to build strong Church units because the calling of Israel was exactly on the same format people have become so migratory in church in this church today in that church tomorrow because they lack the principles they are looking for a holy church which they will not find we are Gentiles so God deals with you an individual are you together with me that's the principal Church Israel was in one nation but had 12 independent tribes and each tribe had a tribal leadership and every one nation churches reminding us of church being one body but having different insights local churches God is in every one of those churches working differently depending on the needs of the church even Israel each tribe had a particular commission but yet all of them encamped around the same Tabernacle under the same law under the same Prophet under the same goal in Exodus under the same you know sacrifice under the same pill of fire are you together with me so our local churches are not in competition praise God are you together with me we may be different the way of deliver of services but that's according to what the serious challenges are so our churches are not in competition but under a different anointing depending on the needs of a local amen are you here ministers we are not competing with anybody oh we've got more people we've got more this it's just like in a see you know somebody's fishing here there's more fish in that place there is less fish it's not because you are a better [Music] fisherman are you together with me when is iter God bless you brother advised that don't never leave your church stay with your pastor do everything you can in your own local church he also say every one of you has got something to do now every one of you get right in your church and work just as hard as you can for your local church but don't never [Applause] criticize God have mercy what's wrong with the people how can the hand criticize the fruit praise the Lord Brother Bram says remember the good Samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him to an in then he says that's the church and gave the man two p and told him if he need any more he would pay him when he come so he's got two P he able to doctor you up amen if he's a man of God if he a man of God that stands on the word of God he's got what God gave him the two P the spirit and the word amen how is it we are to worship spirit and Truth amen PR the Lord yes sir he gave him two P the spirit and the word and he says when he has any need I'll give him more when I come hallelujah hallelujah he says I put you in the I given him the spirit and the word but that's not over but back and forth I'll make Cycles in that church when there is need I'll come again and run a Revival among the people amen do you have need you are the reason why the master must praise God your local church to God ask him to support the minister in a way that he would be able to reach you amen don't become a church fire the church where your wounds will be Nast amen you've got all kinds of wounds God have mercy you've got mean Spirits youve got jealous spirits you've got angry Spirits you've got all kinds of things you need the right Church to deal with your you need healing from childhood you've suffered mood swings amen you are never understood that today you another man tomorrow you another one signs of depression have had control over you you have a bipolar condition your two Natures linked together today you are one Manor you another man you need sister Rebecca to n you and and teach you matters of divine approach amen church is very important amen the Bible says a House of Prayer a House of Prayer House of judgment helps you to exercise the kingdom life amen Kingdom life amen how to live with your neighbor in such a Harmony that's where the work of the ministry is so the truth is that we are called as individuals but we shall be raptured as a body amen so we shall be gathered unto our people by you being part of church then you are identifying with your Eternal Body Abraham gave up his spirit and was GED to his people are you together with who are your people if you can't get along with anybody whom are you going to be gathered up with whom are you going to go with beyond the m God have mercy are you in the church you isn't that wonderful you exercise the Kingdom Life in this body you need a new spirit to come into your new heart with the old Spirit you can't get along with yourself you keep blaming yourself I to myself I SP to myself why L he says come into the blood be washed come into the church and be
