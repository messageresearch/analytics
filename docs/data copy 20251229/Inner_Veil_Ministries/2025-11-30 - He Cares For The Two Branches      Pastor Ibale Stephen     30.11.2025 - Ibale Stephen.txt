So we want to be father like the the wise men to be like the wise man. The wise men who came from the east. They packed goods to come and see the Lord. And whatever they brought, Father, you made sure that it was a meaningful thing, Lord, until it was showing what Jesus was, I pray, Lord Jesus, as your children have brought something, Lord, as an offering or tithe, Lord, may it serve the purpose, the very purpose of it, Lord. and bless the work of their hands.

One glimpse of his defense. [singing] For sorrows will raise [music] [singing] bravery under rest till we [singing and music] see &gt;&gt; all it to be. It will be worth [singing] it all. [music] When we see Jesus, life trial [singing] will [music] seem so small. When we [singing] see Christ, one glimpse of [singing and music] his deface, all sorrows will [singing and music] erase. So bravery run till we [music and singing] see Christ. Sometimes the sky, sometimes [singing] the sky looks dark with [music] no array of light with [music and singing] tilted hand on no [singing] human side. But there [singing] is one in heaven [music] who knows our deepest care. Let Jesus [singing and music] solve your problems. Just go to him [singing and music] in prayer. Left this left day [singing and music] will soon be over. All songs forever [music] [singing] pass. We cross the great divine to [singing] safe at last. [music] You share juice of heaven. I have a home. [singing] The [music] death will be banished. We [singing] never be to be worth it. When we [singing] see Jesus, [music] life trio [singing] [music] [singing] [music and singing] will erase. So brave [singing] we [music] run the race till we see Christ. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; You be worthy. will be worth it all [music] when we [singing] see Jesus. Life's trial will see [singing] when we [music] see Christ.

[singing] [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father, &gt;&gt; how could we ever be able to love you? if you have not given us the love to love you with. Thank you for the love you have shed upon our hearts which extends father dear Lord God the brotherhood &gt;&gt; to one another Lord and we have come together father to express that we are one body we have been filled by the one spirit to become the one church. Lord, now we pray calling upon a blessing upon every soul that has gathered here. Father, that you may bless them in a special way. We bring down all the obstacles the enemy always tries to put. Each time the children of God come to the house of God will move them. Take the people beyond their fears. Take the people beyond father all kinds [music] of domestic issues.

[applause] And if there's any yet of the children that have come back home for holiday. &gt;&gt; We want to say you are welcome. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we have any vis among us this morning? Is this your first time? Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't seem to have a visa this time. Amen. Amen. So it fs my lord this morning uh to stand and speak to you on a subject that I've been pondering for about 3 months now. It was giving me sleepless nights. And then my daughter Faith &gt;&gt; says, "I filled every book in the house. I filled every book in the house about John 15." He was telling brother Tim do. discussed it with a few brothers, but I still felt like what the Lord put upon my heart, &gt;&gt; I can humbly be able to share it with you. Amen. Amen. Because John 15 is a very very very important part of scripture. which speaks about you. Amen. As the vine. So before we proceed, hope the young people have a song for us this morning. I just want you to be st, you know, in such a stable mood. Amen. Amen. I'll take a little longer to finish the thought that I have. Amen. Amen. I bless you. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abide with me. [singing] Fast falls thy even. My darkness [singing and music] depends Lord with me [singing] abide.

[singing and music] Oh thou [singing] who changes [music] not abide [singing] with [music] me. I [singing] need [music] thy pray [singing] every passing [music] of what by [singing] thy grace can foil [singing] the tempest [music] power. Ooh, [music and singing] like thyself, my [singing] guide and sen. [music] Through cloud [singing] and sunshine, [music] Lord abide [singing] with [music] me.

Oh [singing] Lord abide with [music] me. [singing] He abide. [music] Heal [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] with [singing] me. [music] I'm rejoicing night [singing] and [music] day as I walk the narrow way. For [singing and music] the comfort abide [singing] with me, [music] he [singing] abide. Are you [singing] here [music] with me? [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing night and day as [singing] I walk the narrow [music] way. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, the comforter abise with [singing] me. Oh, [music and singing] I'm rejoicing night and day [music and singing] as I walk the narrow way. for [singing and music] the confessor abise [singing] with me. [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; The dove abides. &gt;&gt; The dove abides. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh just want us to get into the scripture reading if we can stand up. Uh you know when you come to this age &gt;&gt; the things you do are not for any purpose because you are doing the last things and you think you are doing the best. When you come to our age, you'll be able to understand that you can find out from brother, brother seai that when you come to a certain particular age, brother Fred knows, you don't dress to impress anybody anymore. more. No, you are the world begins to narrow down and you are just looking at the channel the way out. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so sometimes uh when I stand down here to preach, it's because I pondered over certain things. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit causes you to get into a certain scripture and it drives you maybe for a week, a month, it keeps coming back. Amen. Amen. We are on the home stretch. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you don't mind, let us bow our heads to the earth. Hence where we came and God who created us and put us in the dust of the earth. I pray that he'll be present with us. to speak to us this morning and to make these words alive. Father, we ask for your presence and not only for presence, but father that your presence may produce his effects among us as we preach this morning. Bless the pastor of the church. Bless the support hands, Lord. Bless the families here gathered. And Lord, I pray that you may open the eyes like Elisha prayed to open the eyes of his servants that he may look to the unseen and be able to look into dimension of life. We need you father in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So John 15, I'll start with two verses. &gt;&gt; Verse one and verse two. Brother Masa, you are welcome. Amen. Amen. Brother Masa is one of the people who can drive you in the Kayola bus. Amen. He's a deacon in the church in Toro. But now by work is best here. So John 15 verse one and two he says I am the true vine and my father is the husband man. He doesn't say I am a vine but he says I am the true vine. Every branch in me, that's very wonderful statement, that beareth not fruit, he taketh away. The branch is in him. And for a season, it may fail to bear fruit, but yet it's a branch in him, and every branch in me that beareth fruit that beareth fruit He purges it &gt;&gt; that it may bring forth more fruit. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So he says I am. And this I am is a reference to the alpha and omega. The unchanging God. He doesn't have yesterday. He doesn't have a tomorrow. He's always I am. The I am was the father of Abraham. I am the father of Isaac. I am the father of Jacob. Not I was but I am. &gt;&gt; So God in Christ identified himself under several attributes. He says I am the bread of life meaning the alpha and omega was the bread of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the bread which came down from heaven. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. Then he says, I am the light of the world. I am the door to the ship. I am the good shepherd. I am the resurrection. Not I will be but I am. So I am is the description of the allsufficient God. The God that David speaks about in Psalms 23. The Lord is my shepherd. Now the Lord is actually in there is all the attributes that God is. And because David sees him under that fullness then he says I lack nothing. I know I have got family deeds but I am is here. I know my body is sick but I am is here. Are you together with me? Just in the week, I couldn't even come out of bed. Amen. I was just beaten flat down and we had to get some kind of a a physician. I know one thing. I am was present there with amen. So I always believe that whatever I do, I might be doing it for the last time. Amen. So John 15 that we are dealing with today is we are dealing with the I am that is taking the identity of a true vine a true vine. So he's not saying I am a vine but he's saying I am a true vine. meaning that is totally different from all the vines upon the earth. But he has chosen to use the vine to explain himself his character, his nature, his relationship with the church. So when the word true is used of Christ, it brings or it speaks about the capstone revelation of Christ. Amen. You see you know the cupstone revelation meaning there isn't any form of revelation below that but he is the capstone revelation. Meaning that he is the one who has finally come out and projected himself as the manifested fullness of the Goded body. And that also speaks about a finished work because when he's working, he's still revealing himself in his work. And by revelation of what? BUT WHEN WE talk about the capstone revelation, we are talking about him at the top revealing himself. He has come to a point where he needs no prophet to prophesy about him because he is that prophecy now and it is present. So true means that we are looking at Christ beyond the shadows that represented him. I will show you something here. That when he is presenting himself to the seven church ages. Amen. He presents particular attributes about himself to particular church age that was necessary for that church to hold on and be able to overcome the enemy. So now in the first church he says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand who walks in the midst of the seven golden candles. So he was in control of all the messengers of the churches that were going to come through. And the way God uses a messenger and the way he protects that messenger is a reflection of how he's going to use the church and he protects the church. for we were firmly in his right hand. Amen. When he comes into the next churches, he says, "I'm the first and the last which was dead and is alive." Now, we would say he was alive, but he's dead naturally speaking. But here he says, "I was dead, but now I'm alive." So he's presenting himself as the victory over death. Amen. Amen. Are you together with me? So he presents himself as that great victory when all the attributes that revealed Christ through the seven churches were revealed in the last church age. That is when Malachi 4 comes with the capstone revelation of Christ because there was no more to reveal. Amen. That's why at this time he says, "He that overcometh will I grant to seat in my throne?" Because the journey right now is almost over. We are walking the last stretch and be able to go home and rest from the labors. And he wipes our tears. So whatever you do, do the best way you know how. Are you together with me? If you come to church, mean what you are doing. Because we are in the capstone area. If we fall now, Amen. There is no redeeming messenger to come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we must do the best we can. Whenever we do what we do now, the in the book of uh seven church ages, the Lordian church, brother Brham says, Jesus is giving us this description of himself in relation to the last age. The days of grace are winding up. He has looked from the first century right through to the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages. Before he reveals the characteristics of this last church to us, he gives us one final look at his own glorious and supreme deity. This is the capstone revelation of himself. So we are in the last churches. AND GOD is giving us the last of the revelations about himself in this flesh. The next we shall have of him is when we shall be like him after our body change and I trust we are all looking for those hours. Amen. So in this last church, Christ is now revealed in doctrine. You cannot add any scripture that can change what we know Christ to be. Christ is being revealed as the fullness of the Godhead this time in the body of the bride. Are you together with me? So Christ is revealed and having preeminence among his people. So we come to a point where Christ should be everything in our lives. Amen. Capstone revelation appealing to capstone response from the bride. Amen. Amen. So Christ is revealed and having preeminence. If you say, "Show me Christ." I want us to turn to one another and say, "This is the only way you can understand the fullness of the Godhead body. not in the Jesus body. But he has taken another body, the body of the bride. Amen. That's the capstone revelation. Amen. So, uh, also we see that the son of man ministry which was promised in St. Luke 17 and in agreement with Revelation 10:7, is all fulfilled. There is nothing to look forward to but the change of our bodies in the coming of the Lord. So currently we are not looking forward for more prophets in the end time. Amen. He introduces himself to this age. Now in Revelation chapter 3 verse14 and he says unto the angel of the church of the lordicians right this thing says the amen the true witness the beginning of the creation of God. So he's giving now the titles of his identification. He now calls himself the man. Meaning that there is nothing more to look forward for. Because when you say faith prayer, amen, you when you say amen, what happens is that your prayer is done. So he says, "I am the amen." AND THEN HE SAYS, "THE faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God." Are you together with me? Because we are now the forming for of a new creation. The fallen creation IS GOING TO PHASE OUT. But there is a new creation. And part of that creation is me and you. But he calls himself the beginning of that creation. So as a true witness, he stands OUT ABOVE ALL THE SHADOWS. That's what makes him a true witness. Are you together with me? Yeah. A faithful witness. The way you know like in a a case or court he must say I saw I have I this or the evidence. at himself. NOW HE BECOMES THE faithful witness, the manifestation of every shadow that came over to us. And I told you that whenever there is a shadow is because there is an object standing somewhere and the light is hitting ON THAT OBJECT. AND THEREFORE A SHADOW COMING over here. And then he has been coming. And at the time now he's going to face out the shadows because he has finally come. SO HE SAYS I'M NOW a true witness. Amen. The prophet says in the Philadelphiaian churches, &gt;&gt; he says these things says he is true. Now this word true is a very wonderful word. It does not mean true in just the sense that it is opposite of false. Are you together with me? Like ideas and then you say that's wrong, this is right. like a production of objects, you know, in a factory &gt;&gt; and you say this one is genuine, this one is not. You know, is the prophet says that's not what he means when he says true. It is it expresses perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with partial realization. Are you together with me like the lamb was a partial realization of the Messiah the redeemer. So when he comes forth is not that lamb anymore. It is I that is true. And John introduces him as the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Amen. Praise the Lord. So Moses the prophet says gave you that bread from heaven. But my father giveth you the bread from heaven. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So John 5 and 15 verse one he says I am the true v. Now in Hebrews 9:24 if we can go there a little bit. Christ Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the truth, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; He did not enter into the holy places made with hands because in the Old Testament on the day of atonement, the priest comes from among the people to enter places that are made by man. He enters into the first court, goes into the second court, goes into the third court, presents the blood, and after he presents the blood, he walks out. But now, [screaming] when Jesus comes to do the redemption, what happens here is not going into places which are made by heart. when he was sacrificed, crucified on Calvary, and he died, rose on the third day, AND HE COME ALIVE. Praise God. I want you to know this. We, you know, he met Mary Magdalene, a man in the garden. And Mary wanted to touch her. And he says, "Woman, don't touch me. I'm not ascended to the father." He was not ascending to places made with many. He was going to ascend into the heavens. HALLELUJAH. AND BETWEEN THAT day and the coming I mean and the appearing in the meeting where Tom was. Amen. Who wanted to touch him and he allowed him he had already ascended. Hallelujah. And when he ascended it means IF HE WAS ACCEPTED he was accepted for you. BUT IF YOU ALSO FACE OUT TODAY, you have got the access. He's the firstborn among many brethren. He's the beginning of THAT NEW CREATION THAT WHEN THEY GET OUT OF THE BODY, THEY JUST ASCEND direct to the father. Oh, that way he is the true lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And John 1:28, first John 2:8, he says, "Because the darkness is passed, the darkness is passed and the true light now shineth." Since the word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial REALIZATION as illustrated in these verses. We can now understand as never before antype contrasted with type the substance with the shadow. Take the example of now mana from heaven. God sent down angel bread. from heaven for Israel. But that bread did not satisfy. It was only good for a day. Those who ate it were hungry again the next day. It was left around. It was contaminated. But Jesus is the true bread from heaven. Amen. where of mana was just a type. And if any man eats of that bread that came from heaven, he will never hunger again. He does not need to come back and eat again. The moment he parttook of the eternal life. Amen. So he indeed was reality not needed any longer &gt;&gt; for the shadow. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NO NEED OF a shadow now because the light has come and that light is now shining out. Amen. to identify the Lord Jesus before us. And I want you to know that when you come to church, you don't come to prostrate before an idea. You don't come to prostrate before a good doctrine. You don't come to prostrate. Amen. before a good teacher. When you come down here, you are coming in the presence of he that is true. That's how far we have come into the capstone revelation of Christ which is not an idea but a reality. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, we come to a point where there must come something that makes what we do become real. Whereby if I have come to church, I have not come to please my brother. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why today we are looking at these two vines I mean branches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which are in uh uh which are in John 15:2 and he says I am the true vine. So we are NOT TALKING ABOUT VINES AS IN A FORM. BUT WE are talking about the Lord Jesus Christ showing himself this morning before us as a true vine upon which every branch is you know in amen is not grafted in but it is growing &gt;&gt; from him. It lives not by its life, but it lives, by his life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the title this morning is he cares for the two branches. He cares for the two branches. Praise the Lord. So uh I I want you to know here &gt;&gt; that uh you know in this case we look at the vine as a creeper plant for example You know that's a creeper. That's a vine. That's what a vine is. So while we look at that, it is hiding the details in there to teach our relationship with Christ the true vine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So a vine is a creeper. &gt;&gt; Although brother Brham &gt;&gt; takes the same vine principle and uses it in preaching sometimes on the bride tree. Praise the Lord. So I'll give you this quote here in letting off the pressure. If you love him, say amen. He says, "I preached the other day on the bright tree on EASTER MORNING. NOW THAT Christ was the tree that was perfect, David saw it and said, "Is standing by the rivers of water and how Rome cut that tree down and perfect tree bearing perfect fruits of God and hung it on a manmade tree. Amen. Amen. But God raised it up on the third day. And then there come a bride, a bride tree, coming forth, bringing forth his fruit. and come the enemy again and cut it down through the dark ages. I we restore says the Lord how that Lutheran raised and dominated and the vine was pruned. Are you together with me? He's now talking about a bright tree. But then he uses the pris again. And so he brings in the word, the vine was pruned. Up come the Methodist denominated. The vine was pruned. Up come the Pentecostal denominations was pruned. But the fruit ripens in the top of the tree when THE EVENING LIGHTS COME OUT, we are near the ro. So we are expecting great things in the future. Hallelujah. So now right at the top of the tree, we are not at the bottom. We are not in the MIDDLE BUT WE ARE AT the top. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And as the light shines, the fruit begins to ripen. So I want you to bear in mind that John 15 is not dealing with a tree is dealing with the vine WHICH HAS THREE TYPES of branches. Are you together with me? Amen. Amen. So John 15 verse two he says every branch in me that beareth not fruit he takes away. &gt;&gt; There is a temptation to think that he cuts it off. But this branch is IN HIM BY CUTTING IT is cutting his own life. You get get to understand that very well. AND EVERY BRANCH THAT BEARETH FRUIT, he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit. So here we have got the branch that it taketh away, but it is in him. And we have a branch here which beareth fruit and it is in him. He purges it. And when then we have another category of branch. This one here is spoken about in John 15 verse six. &gt;&gt; Listen to the words she begins with. If a man abide not in me, he's using the word a man. And remember when we spoke about man and a man, are you together with me? In the beginning, it was man. God created man. He carried the image of God. But after the fall, then there was a man that was the car man. And in the Bible, when they say a man, a certain man means that that man is not under the will OF GOD. SO HE SAYS, "IF A MAN ABIDE NOT in me, HE'S CAST OFF AS A branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them in the fire and they aband There IS NO GRACE. HE CUTS IT. HE THROWS IT IN THE FIRE. BUT THE BRANCHES OF VERSE TWO, they carry his life. YOU CAN BE IN CHRIST AND FOR a moment fail to bear fruit. [sighs] &gt;&gt; So we are going to bring it together. and see where the scripture takes us. So I've said this other category of branch he refers to it as a man. So to this branch he cast forth as a branch. SO THE WORD TO CAST here means to throw or let go of anything without caring where it falls. You understand what I mean? Cast it away. You don't care WHERE IT FALLS. IT DOESN'T have the father's love. Are you together with me? So the language in verse six disowns the third branch. Uh disowns. But in verse two, he owns the two branches. every branch in me &gt;&gt; which is in him by birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; A BRANCH THAT DID NOT JOIN CHURCH. IT'S NOT A GRAFTED BRANCH, but it's an original branch. IT HAS GOT HIS DNA. IT COMES FROM THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; IT COMES FROM THE SAME SOURCE WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; You see this is where it's very important that father I must be born again. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The new birth is very important because it makes you part of him. You share in his DNA and the only way you can be born is because in the father are you together with me? But this other one here, if a man if a man abide not in me, if he does not have my seed, if he's only in church as a sucker of blessings, he said that one &gt;&gt; I CAN CAST AWAY NOT CARING. where it falls. But this John 15 IS GOD taking care of his children. If I am If I am is the alpha and omega, &gt;&gt; the unchanging God, he has got enough power to protect his children. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to cause them to bear fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FRUIT COMES FROM A LIFE that doesn't belong to the branch, but it comes from the vine. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You see, that's why I say when you come to church, mean what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Don't be a man. Be that branch. &gt;&gt; God in Christ identifies himself under several attributes. He said, "I am the bread of life and all those others." Amen. &gt;&gt; So I am &gt;&gt; is the description &gt;&gt; of all the allsufficient God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now when the word true is used I told you of Christ it means that he's real. &gt;&gt; He's true. He's not an idea. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's that living and present God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Yeah. I'm trying to get myself out here in order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts and clears throat] Now God Christ cannot get his own life and throw it in fire. This one of verse six is a grafted branch. Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; You know the science of today, they can get an avocado tree and they go and cut a lemon branch and bring it here on the avocado tree. And this lemon branch will feed on the life of an AVOCADO TREE. AND still produce lemons. So when I say like that then it helps us to identify ourselves. Am I a lemon tree branch? I mean am I a lemon branch? That's where the question is. Am [screaming] I a lemon branch? &gt;&gt; Lord, help me to identify myself. IF I'M NOT A LEMON branch and I'm failing to bear fruit, I must be the branch. If any man abide in me and fails to bring fruit from that point down you begin to cry, Lord, help me to bring forth fruit. I cannot bear fruit on my own. I don't want by accident. I don't even want to imagine. that I am the grafted branch. Otherwise, any time you cast me away, not even caring where I fall. Amen. Somebody say amen. He says here in uh we would see Jesus he says now the vine doesn't bear fruit it's the branch just turn around to your brother and tell him I am supposed to bear fruit. That's a good confession. Do it again. Do it until the devil hears it. &gt;&gt; I am supposed to breathe, not man. But if I'm an original branch, I'm supposed to bring forth. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if that first branch that come out of the vine produced a book of Acts behind it, that first church, if that VINE ever puts forth another branch, it will write another book of Acts behind. For the life of that vine brings forth into the branch. Sure, we got a lot of grafted branches in here. That's what the prophet says. Amen. A grafted branch will certainly bring forth I mean forth the life of the parent seat. It cannot therefore write another page of another book of acts. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now you are not going to write THIS BOOK ALONE. MAYBE YOU ARE GOING to contribute a verse. Hallelujah. BUT YOU ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO PRODUCE something because you are an attribute of the life that is in the fire. Are you together with me? But John, I mean 15:6, &gt;&gt; THEY ARE GRAFTED branches &gt;&gt; of Hebrews 6. Are you together with me? AND THESE BRANCHES CAN be around CHURCH FOR A LONG TIME BUT still fail to bring forth fruit. They are cast away. I don't want to be that fruit. When they are cast away, you know, start looking at the midweek services. Start looking at the evening service on Sunday. Then you know cast away. I don't even care where they fall. Start looking at the communion service. He cares &gt;&gt; for the two branches. Listen &gt;&gt; in Hebrews chapter 6. If we turn there, [cough] excuse me. He says, &gt;&gt; "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened in verse four and have tested of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost. those who tested what the Holy Spirit does. Amen. And tested the good word of God and the powers of the world to come. All the time they are testing and testing and testing. No wonder these days they say try Jesus. &gt;&gt; They test. &gt;&gt; But the other vine, it does not have another alternative but Christ. Amen. Because it come from Christ. Where shall we go? &gt;&gt; Amen. You have the words of eternal life. Isn't that amen? He has the words of eternal life. We don't have anywhere else to go but to him. Amen. Verse six. If they fall away to renew them again unto repentance, Seeing they crucified themselves to the son of God aresh and put him to an open shell. Now they are falling away NOT CARING WHERE THEY FALL. Either they fall into this organization or they fall into that denomination or they fall into this habit or they fall into that habit. He says, "Well, that's a branch cut off." &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? So these are the cast away branches and to these Christ does not care where they fall. You start looking amen at the interest you know he has to hide under a status. I know. Uhhuh. Status on the phone. &gt;&gt; Oh, and he puts a song &gt;&gt; and it is a rock and roll. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. That means &gt;&gt; he's hanging out somewhere trying to fall and he doesn't care where he fall. They hide behind status. Happy birthday my friend. and the picture of the dress. I'm sure she has some better dresses. Are you together with me? You see, you know, hanging on a thread, waiting to be upset. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. We just want to get these things right. Brother Brham called them borderline believers. They are in church but not in the church. the invisible church of Christ. Amen. They stay around the message for long periods, &gt;&gt; but they don't fully surrender their soul. Amen. They don't own what they believe. Why do you GO TO THAT CHURCH? Then they give an explanation. But if you aren't what you believe, then you stand to give witness what you believe. Amen. They are in church because you know the reason why I'm in that church, I'm in this town because I stay with my brother who goes to that church. You know they are that other third branch. The best they could produce is the picture. The image of a rich younger ruler. You &gt;&gt; must be born again. Brother Brham in questions and answers of 59. He says is now explaining this grip. The third branch you know it stands between out and in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uticus &gt;&gt; in the midnight service. He was not in he was not out. He sat in the window, the legs in the body out. And when he fell, he doesn't fall in. You have to be in completely. Amen. Years ago, we used to have young men. They used to sit at the front here and they were the amen of the church. And then the next thing they started sitting in the back and that was a sign the branch was being cut off. You see the prophet says let me just give it a parable so that you'll see and won't miss it now. Now he is writing to these Jews. Some of them are borderline believers. So he's writing to those people. Now they are in the border trying to hold the law and enter it with it into the New Testament under the blood sacrifice of Christ. And they are going in there with the ministrations of death because the law is a ministration of death. Is a revealer of where you fail but is not having enough power to help you live the life. [sighs] Amen. &gt;&gt; So these are coming &gt;&gt; exactly through from you know repentance from dead works and faith towards God. THEY HAD COME by the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment. They had come through that phase but they were not willing. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; TO GO beyond that into union with Christ. &gt;&gt; They were not WILLING &gt;&gt; TO GO into perfection. AND SOMETIMES YOU COME THROUGH the water baptism and you come through all these other things. &gt;&gt; But then you are failing to go beyond THAT personal connection to Christ where you are going to say I'm a branch in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. BY THE BASEL OF THE HOLY GHOST AND FAITH in every teaching and practicing every teaching. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, see, he said now we are going to leave these WORKS and go on to TALK ABOUT PERFECTION. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU together with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, you know they are talking about thunders now. &gt;&gt; They are talking about deep things. Uhhuh. Let us go on to perfection. &gt;&gt; If you don't ever hear them, &gt;&gt; how will you ever learn them? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must be born into this message. Don't come one limb Catholic doctrine and then on this other side you want it to be in the message. In this side you've got a Baptist teaching and again this other side you want to come to the message. That's why you fail to bear fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN by the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; He says now we are talking about now we are talking about baptisms and resurrection of the dead and laying of the hands and everything. But let us go ahead and talk about perfection. Now we are going to talk about when you COME INTO THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. Now you've been hanging around the meeting a long time. Hallelujah. Hanging around the meeting. YOU COME into the overnight. BUT IT HAS TO BE. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN ACCORDING to the message of the hour. Any branch in me, I will be responsible. WHEN IT DOESN'T BEAR FRUIT, I'll be responsible. I'll take it away. Amen. And if IT BEARS, I CONTINUE TO PARD IT, BUT IT BRINGS MORE FRUIT. He wants YOU TO COME TO a level where he becomes concerned and responsible. Amen. And you've seen those people, they'll stay around. They won't come in or go out. They appreciate the Holy Ghost. They will come around. Maybe the Holy Ghost do something and man, they will get up and shout and jump down the floor about it. But they never want to receive those things. And they will say, "Oh yes, that's good. I don't know how about that." Now borderline believers just so close they can test it they yet they don't receive it. They just test. They don't swallow. You swallow the whole thing and become a message believer. Amen. He says now they hang around like that so long till after a while they drift completely away TO RENEW THEM TO repentance there's no repentance for them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We must own what we believe and be part of it. Oh, you always have long dresses. You always have long dresses. That is that is mommy. &gt;&gt; Oh, your mommy. Can't you trim this and we see them and you can't put them out because we are not legalist. You must be a branch born in him. We need to be identified as the two branches of John 15:2 that carry his life because they are in him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The John 152 branches HAVE CERTAIN QUALITIES TO them that are synonymous with eternal life because the scriptures the branch in me. THAT MEANS THAT BRANCH is an elected branch. Therefore, it has eternal security. THE HUSBAND MAINTAINED AS THESE BRANCHES TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY MAY BRING FORTH FRUIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Elected branches. Now election means something chosen of God and this choosing is himself put out. Amen. A little form of attribute of himself into another body called you. Therefore you ARE THE SAME SOURCE. YOU ARE THE SAME LIFE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. ELECTION MEANS THAT YOU attribute that was in him. BUT YOU ALLOW TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT BODY. THEREFORE, YOU WERE IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. YOU ARE AN extension of who Christ is. [clears throat] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a way, &gt;&gt; we can say YOU ARE THE WOMB OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE CREATED TO BEAR FRUIT FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MAY TAKE A LITTLE longer like Elizabeth, BUT JOHN THE BAPTIST, YOU MUST BE BORN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONG LIKE SAMUEL'S MAN. BUT THE RIGHT SEASON MUST be ah praise the Lord. That's where we are coming from. We must be the same source of life with the vine. &gt;&gt; Let's go to first Peter chapter one verse. You know it's not good to be an old man. I'll ask some Steven, you want to be an old man? &gt;&gt; He says no. So you keep drinking here and here trying to keep yourself alive. So first Peter 1 verse 2 he says elect according to the fornowledge of God the father you don't come as an accident &gt;&gt; like I was teaching substance God knew you and your path. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And whatever you needed, HE PUT IT ALONG THAT JOURNEY AS SUBSTANCE. FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS HOPED FOR. YOU WALK INTO your substance. pull it down. &gt;&gt; SO, ELECT ACCORDING TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF GOD THE FATHER. SO, God knew he would be here AS A BRANCH TO THE VINE. AMEN. through sanctification of THE SPIRIT and obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE HAS GOT AN UMBRELLA [screaming] OF PEACE AND GRACE over you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So according to full knowledge &gt;&gt; OF GOD BY sanctification of your spirit. Now we come to these two branches. We have cast the other one away not caring where it falls. Now we are dealing with these two branches. NOW HE'S TALKING ACCORDING to the full knowledge of God by sanctification of your spirit. So this form of sanctification causes certain concerns in life. You are concerned. You care. There is something in you that causes you to care. Concerned about how you walk. Amen. Concerned about HOW [screaming] you are going to dress. If your dress causes any QUESTION in you DOES NOW THE HOLY GHOST SANCTIFYING your spirit leave it. Amen. My daughters would come with certain dresses that daddy this one HERE IF IT OFFENDS you in any way if it causes a question in any way sanctification of spirit. NOW HE'S PREPARING you to THE FACT THAT YOU may bear fruit. IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN QUESTIONS ABOUT your hairstyle, &gt;&gt; DROP IT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S NOW YOUR HOLY SPIRIT, YOUR ASSIAN spirit being sanctified. Amen. You get concerned over this, you get concerned over that. YOU GET CONCERNED OVER how you deal with your husband or your wife. IF YOU HAVE THOSE QUESTION IS God bringing caution to your human spirit is deal WITH SANCTIFICATION OF SPIRIT. You do a daily sanctification because you have chosen to live under the blood. Hallelujah. If you are a man AND YOU BEGIN TO ASK, how about this one here? Is it tight? You know, many times we talk about the the women, but the men they are getting their 12 tighter. When you come to ask SANCTIFICATION OF SPIRIT YOU PUT IT OUT because your spirit should not have questions. IF THE QUESTIONS ARE THERE, THE HOLY SPIRIT is trying to clean it. Elect according to the fornowledge. And this election speaks of eternal security. Are you together with me? Because election is that you came from him as a little gene and you were kept in a box which is called you and because you have got an attribute of the father. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Put in YOU THEN THE SECURITY OF GOD will watch over that body. [screaming] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. YOU MAY TAKE A LONG TIME WHEN YOU ARE NOT bearing fruit. BUT A TIME WILL COME and God will order man TO GO AND PULL YOU OUT OF THE FIRE LIKE JOSHUA THE PRIEST. AND BRING YOU HERE so that YOU MAY BE WASHED AND THEN be dressed AND BECOME A PRIEST with God. That means abiding presence because you are a branch in him that must bring forth fruit. AMEN. HE SAYS, "EVERY [screaming] BRANCH in me, amen, that beareth not fruit, &gt;&gt; he taketh away." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice the setting of that verse. HE SAYS EVERY BRANCH in me it means that this branch here &gt;&gt; is not grafted. It is an original branch and an original BRANCH ROSE from inside and comes the outside. is different from verse six if a man abides not in me. &gt;&gt; So there is A WAY A BRANCH in him may for a season bear no fruit. But he does not cast it away like the one of verse six because he can't cut his own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He cannot cut off I mean his own you know attribute in the garden. This man ADAM HE COMES here and he finds Eve there and the serpent there. Do you think Adam &gt;&gt; would walk back home and he says, "I don't care." &gt;&gt; He had to redeem his branch. &gt;&gt; He had to go IN AND REDEEM his branch. SO, RESTORE HEART TO ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Did you come from God? &gt;&gt; You are in the wrong corner. He walks towards you this morning. He wants to restore you. Praise the Lord. Let's talk about the vine. To fully understand verse two, we must remind ourselves that we are not dealing with a tree. We are dealing with a vine. A vine is a creeper. And for it to bear good fruit, it must be taken away. And this taken away in the Greek let it doesn't mean to cut off it means to lift &gt;&gt; like you know people who know how to farm tomatoes so that they may not rot They always try to bring some kind of poles and they cause those tomatoes to go around that pole. Have you seen that is taking away? Are you together with me now? &gt;&gt; THAT'S A BRANCH TAKEN AWAY. IS NOT A BRANCH CUT OFF. IT'S A [screaming] BRANCH TAKEN AWAY SO THAT IT may bear. The passion fruit is a vine is the vine. You know when you let it flow on the ground, it can bring FORTH SOME FRUIT. BUT IF YOU TAKE IT AWAY, it will be able to bear more. So he CARES FOR both branches in John 15:2. The statement take away means TO LIVE so that it can fairly bear good fruit in the Greek lexical. You see, every branch in me that beareth no fruit, he taketh away. So it only makes sense when you know the vine is a creeper is not talking about a tree are you together with me. The branch in the is, you know, which is not bearing fruit. It's in the category of a lamp that is lit and put on the bush. It doesn't mean it cannot produce light, but the environment around it is trying to hamper the light. So God only removes the bush AND THEN THE LIGHT CAN COVER THE HOUSE. AMEN. This first BRANCH that cannot BEAR UP FRUIT, IT DOESN'T mean it can never just the circumstance. God wants to begin to deal with your circumstance to the effect THAT YOU MAY BRING FORTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Sometimes in teaching we deal with English statements that are used interchangeably in certain verses. And if you do not get careful, you start contradicting yourself. I will take an example of Matthew 11:28. I'll take you there. Next time if the Lord permits, we shall talk about rest. How many people are seeking to rest who are like Ruth? They are seeking to rest. Amen. Amen. So in Matthew 11:28, he says, "COME UNTO ME, oh ye that labor, and that makes labor negative and are heavy and I'll give you rest." And we follow the concept of rest. And we got to Hebrews chapter 4 verse 10. For he that is entered into his rest, he has also seized from his own works, as God did from his. Let us LABOR THEREFORE. NOW THE WORD labor here becomes positive. &gt;&gt; So if you don't get careful, you kind of hit the people's head. He says, "Let us labor therefore enter the rest lest any man fall after the same example of So we need to vis now the word labor. Labor in Matthew 11:28 it means to grow weary. It means tired with toil and burdens and grief. bodily labor just like Israel was in Egypt. So in Matthew he was calling Israel from the grievous labor of the law. They had labored WITH THE LAW and they HAD HARVESTED NOTHING. SO WHEN JESUS CAME, he says, "Come unto me all you who labor and I'll give you rest." So when YOU DEAL with labor in Hebrews 4:11 again seems to contradict Matthew 4, I mean Matthew 11:28. If you don't go and try to understand the concept of labor in Hebrews 41, he says, "Let us labor therefore to enter into the rest." SO DEALING with grammar, one would wonder why Christ would give rest freely and Paul would put forth labor first. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise God. So you know the word to labor in Hebrews 4:11 is interpreted to mean being diligent to meaning and take the rest. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; So it would mean if you are not careful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It would mean that you want TAKE THE PEOPLE BACK again in trying to search for the Holy Ghost to go to the mountain to go to the forest. I don't know who taught the people that the Holy Ghost comes on mountains. and they go into forests to endanger their lives while searching for the Holy Ghost. They are back in labor when Christ gave us rest. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why the Greek translation for the branch is taken away does not mean to be cut. LET'S READ THE VERSE. EVERY BRANCH IN me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away. meaning he lifts it. He taketh away is NOT JUDGMENT TO THE branch but rather to raise it to elevate it to lift it in a wider sense. It is to TAKE UPON THE condition one has been raised to &gt;&gt; so that he can bear fruit. So this morning service we are trying to help that branch and tell that branch that you are not rejected. But God brings you here every Sunday EVERY WEDNESDAY TO LIFT YOU SO THAT YOU CAN bear fruit. So you TAKE SERIOUS EVERY word that is given to you here is instructing you on how you can bear fruit. Amen. In that sense it is Christ being the good shepherd. IT IS CHRIST GOING AFTER THE I mean the one lost and you know and that when he finds it he takes it into the past. Are you together with me? In that sense, God is not an Indian giver and is not trying. And in that way, he does not encourage you to do evil. He's only giving the principle of how he works. If I come here and preach to threaten you, it will not help you because there is no power in there. But when I tell you the principle and you accept THE PRINCIPLE, THERE IS POWER in the principle. Are you together with me? THERE IS POWER IN THE PRINCIPLE. THE LAW HAD AS IT was it didn't change the character of the people. He has to lift the branch. Listen to this quote from the Hebrew chap I mean Hebrew chap I mean chapter 6 part three. The message of brother brother listen this message &gt;&gt; belongs to the elect and he listens it to it &gt;&gt; by the ear not by the ears but by the ear &gt;&gt; of the inner seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; If a man puts an interpretation to the instruction of the spirit, then you know he might be verse six. Listen this is the message Hebrews as I've already said. He said you will make mistakes. He's talking about the good br I mean the good branch. You'll fall. You will do wrong. You'll go out sometimes and do things. That doesn't mean you are lost. And this is meaning don't go and do them. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That means you are going to get correction. My little boy lots of time my children will do things yours do also. They know that is against your rules and they know what happens when they do it. They are going to get a whipping for it. But still it is your child. &gt;&gt; It's impossible for that man to ever be God again. That's was been born of eternal life. THAT ONE CAN'T BE THROWN AWAY. CANNOT BE THROWN AWAY. BUT THE ONE OF SIX is cast away not caring where he falls. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "God is not an Indian GIVER &gt;&gt; WHO gives and then takes away. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; I'm getting Indian uh tenants in my place. But you really need to understand them. The way they understand they are accepting and they are saying no. Sometimes when they are saying no, they are saying yes. But they are trying to play on your mind. God does not play on your mind. Once you are born that branch in me, it cannot be unborn. [laughter] I will I will be I will unparent you. That's a very angry father. &gt;&gt; So whatever he does he does it but that does not mean that your DNA has changed. [laughter] Are you together with me? So this is what BROTHER BRHAM SAID. IF GOD has given you eternal life, it is not everlasting, but it is eternal and is not GIVING IT TO YOU NOW. HALLELUJAH. THE GENE ON THE INSIDE IS GIVEN ANOTHER BODY. YOU ARE AN EXTENSION OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; So he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me everlasting life. I shall never come to JUDGMENT BUT IS PASSED FROM death unto life with him upon the last day. Amen. SO WHAT GOD DOES, HE DEALS WITH THE BRANCH IN JOHN 15:2, HE TAKETH AWAY. He just lifts it. OKAY? HE DOESN'T CAST IT AWAY BECAUSE IT has his own life in the air. Amen. He deals with the circumstances AROUND THE BRANCH. THAT HINDERS IT TO BEAR FRUIT. Oh hallelujah. HE INSPECTS OUR CHARACTER. AMEN. Searches our hearts. INSPECTS OUR FAMILIES. He inspects our areas OF INTEREST. WHAT IS HINDERING THIS BRANCH TO BEAR A THREAT? OH HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SOMETIMES they are shortteered. Sometimes they've got some kind of an inferiority complex. Sometimes they've got a superiority complex. IT BLOCKS THE GOING IN OF THE SEA. IT BLOCKS THE LIFE FLOW SOMEWHERE. So he wants to drill that area. SO THAT his life could GO TO THE POINT WHERE THE BRANCH BRINGETH FORTH FRUIT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he wants to inspect our families. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then a minister will say things TO BRING CORRECTION TO the man. And the man if he's the seed, HE HAS GOT THE COMPONENT IN THERE that can hear the father. And the moment he begins to change, then life begins to come into the father. The fruit becomes evident. He inspects our areas of interest. Do we spend most of our time? watching European League instead of at least visiting the word. HE GOES to the little details ABOUT THIS BRANCH BECAUSE IT MUST BRING FRESH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. The husband man does not cut it off because he's not interested just to cut branches. Where will the profit of the FRUIT COME FROM? When you cut off ALL THE BRANCHES, what he does. Amen. He starts to do certain THINGS FIRST OF all to improve the soil health. Hallelujah. And in that condition talking about the heart condition of a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us go to Luke chapter 13. &gt;&gt; He cares that you bring forth fruit. Doctor is that. Amen. He cares. &gt;&gt; You are the bride and every lady &gt;&gt; would desire to have a child. She went before this priest and she was acting in a very funny way. She was praying in the heart and then the mouth began to to mimic until the priest felt that this woman had come into the house drunk. A real woman will care to bring fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Luke 13:6 HE SPOKE ALSO THIS PARABLE. A CERTAIN man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none. Verse seven. Then said he to the dresser of his vineard, &gt;&gt; behold these years, I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. cut it down. Why come it to the ground? And the dresser answering said that to the Lord, Lord, let it alone this year also. I shall dig about it and dang it, and if it bear fruit, Well, if not then then it will be verse six. We shall cast it away not caring where it falls. Amen. The vine dresser. The vine dresser had special redemptive attributes that cared for the branch that could not bring forth fruit. He was Moses to his people. MOSES, &gt;&gt; GET AWAY that I may destroy them. Moses would get right and he says why do you kill them? If you are going to THE PEOPLE WOULD SAY THERE ARE NO enough graves in Egypt for burying these people that would bring them in the wilderness and kill them here. Okay. Moses and this Moses &gt;&gt; is the burden of your pastor. HE'S TRYING TO SAY, "LORD, HELP THEM THAT they may bring forth fruit." IN HIS PRAYER, LORD, HELP THEM THAT you may bear fruit. AND IF YOU HANA THE MAN OF SAM SAMUEL AND YOU ARE DESPERATE ON THEIR SIDE AND THE DRESSER IS DESPERATE ON THEIR SIDE, there will be fruit upon fruit upon fruit in this church. The dresser, he knows what to do. He will do the mounting of HUV saying maybe the moisture goes out very fast. We must find ways of retaining moisture THAT THE BRANCH can bring forth fruit. He taketh away that it may bear fruit. God himself causes the revival. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Hebrews and we look at Israel. Don't mind. I'm trying my best to get to the third branch and then I mean yeah on the second the third branch and then we are gone. [snorts] Praise God. We've dealt with the one which is cast away. We are dealing with this one which is taken away. But yet we've got the third branch which the pastors love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which the pastor calls the church. It bears fruit but it is parched to bring more fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Okay. Hebrews 8:9. &gt;&gt; Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. because they continued not in my covenant. I regarded them not, says the Lord. But that was not the end of God with Israel because they had his life. You see, this is where my emphasis is seek to be born again. He cares for the two branches. The third one, he doesn't care. Verse 10. For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days. Says the Lord, I'll put my laws into their mind. is beginning to [screaming] lift the branch and write them in their heart. And I'll be to them a god and they shall be to me a people in separable. He just improves &gt;&gt; the CONDITION OF THE SOIL. THE HEART. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH every man his neighbor. Hallelujah. AND EVERY MAN HIS BROTHER, SAYING, "Know the Lord. They shall know me from the least to THE GREATEST." HOW CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE? I [screaming] WILL CAUSE THEM. I WILL LIFT THEM. LET THE WEAK ONE SAY I AM STRONG. Praise God. THAT'S GOD DEALING WITH THE ELECT. SO THE BRANCH IN HIM THAT BEARETH no fruit, he will instill hunger and thirst for the word. He put you in A STATE WHERE YOU CAN BEAR FRUIT. AMEN. HE DOES [screaming] THAT. OH, PRAISE GOD. Does he put new laws? No sir. That lifts you, lifts your spirit. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. This will not be putting a new law but rather coming forth of Christ in the individual lives of the people. He comes down to make the capstone revelation of Christ REAL IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE. Do you love him? And it's THIS THAT WILL CHANGE THE HEART CONDITION. THE PERSON OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. And when he's inside there, he begins TO COME AS THE latter rain to WATER THAT BRANCH. AND THEN something in THERE BEGINS TO FORM FORTH, THE LIFE of [screaming] Christ, and then we bring forth fruit. BECAUSE JOHN 15 is a harvest season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a sewing season. It's a harvest season. SO GOD CARES, BUT you bear fruit. He cares lift you to raise you to the occasion. All the messages you hear are for the intent that you become desperate to become a mother. Amen. IF YOU ARE DESPERATE AND the minister is desperate, there will be a harvest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God does not only put the principles of redemption and leave them there. He makes sure that he gets the child of he has come to redeem connecting to those principles. I'll give you a quote. The pastor just you know went through it &gt;&gt; during the you know broadcast on the church ages. [snorts] He says in the book of Ludicia these things says the faithful and true witness. Now I am to show you what I find in the thought of faithful. You know we often take talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change. And when we speak of him after that manner, we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal. For me, I died for them. I worked. I did my work. My part is up to them. If they don't bear fruit, that's what you think. &gt;&gt; But God lifts the branch. &gt;&gt; But you must come to a point where you are desperate for a child. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross. And then when the death of Christ was atoned for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door, God just folded his arms and stood back. That's not the God we serve. He cares about you. &gt;&gt; Just turn around and tell your brother, "God cares that you bear fruit." Amen. [laughter] He says it's as if we major in believing in a great creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation. He created you but did not love you. That's how you see. That's why you say I wish I could bear fruit. Do you think it is easy? &gt;&gt; God cares that you bring forth fruit. THE PROPHET SAYS NOW I say that's how too many people are up TO THINK BUT THAT is the wrong THINKING FOR GOD IS GOVERNING in the affairs of men right now. He's both creator and sustainer. Hallelujah. Praise God. So let us go to THE THIRD BRANCH. THE THIRD BRANCH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. The branch which bears fruit but still God does not fold HIS HAND. AH, THAT'S a wonderful branch. Every day I go and pick about 10 tomatoes. No, he still says, "I'm very interested THAT YOU MAY BRING MORE FRUIT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; DON'T LOOK AT YOURSELF AND YOU THINK I'M BETTER than so and so until God cares about YOU BRINGING MORE FRUIT. AMEN. So John 15:2 has another branch AND THIS IS THE branch as I say which the pastors are very interested in and it's the only branch that recognizes itself as church because it bears fruit. It carries a testimony. The street knows who they are. So the fruit of the spirit is manifested in them. It is not looked for. It is manifested. Amen. Some of the things they attend every service. They are not Sunday service believers. They attend the communion. They pay their tithes. They you know have settled families. They listen to the taste. They testify around the field. They dress in a reasonable manner. THEY ARE A BRANCH THAT BEARS FRUIT. AND THE PASTOR IS ALWAYS PROUD OF THOSE. BUT I WANT TELL THE PASTOR EVEN THOSE STRUGGLING THEY ARE STILL his sheep. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been a pastor and I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO EVERY BRANCH THAT BEAR FRUIT, he purges it. That it may bring forth more fruit. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I want the good branches to pay attention to me THIS MORNING. I SOMETIMES SAY, "I've got a good family. My family comes to church." You know, we we are not beggars around the church. We've got a good job. YES, THAT'S RIGHT. But I want talk to you. You are forgetting the other part that he wants to p you may bring more fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is a bearing branch &gt;&gt; that testifies to the life of Christ and the CHARACTER OF THE PARENT seed which is Christ himself. IT IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE EXTENSION OF CHRIST. BUT HE MAKES sure that that branch MAKES YOU KNOW KEPT pugged to bring more fruit. So this ping listen friends is different from the ping of Calvary. Amen. where all the two branches were washed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is an individual py. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And when we talk about PY MOST people relate it to chastisement of Hebrews chapter 12 which is also could be another FORM OF P BUT I WANT TO DEAL WITH THE WORD. THE WORD, &gt;&gt; the washing waters of the world to make you brighter and better that you may be able to bring forth fruit because you are already a fruitbearing branch. But in you God's interest is more fruit. Amen. You know our pastor is a farmer. He has got cows. Some give this milk. Some give this much. You know it doesn't matter when the one which gives small liters drops by two liters. is more concerned about this one here than the other one which naturally brings little meat. Is that true pastor? So the CONCERN OF GOD IS SPECIAL on the branch that bears. He wants to talk to you so that you may bring more fruit. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What God does, HE WANTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY of production. Amen. This ping is NOT INTENDED TO have to inflict pain on the branch, but rather to improve the quality of production. He purges. Amen. HE PUNCHES THAT branch by separating. Amen. Two elements. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He separates the soul. and spirit &gt;&gt; so that you can live conscious of your soul and improves on the quality of your human spirit. Hallelujah. HE GOES INTO THE SIGHT OF life with the word and splits the atone. THREADS THE SOUL AND SPIRIT. Then deals with the character of spirit in areas where it affects more production. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 4. Are you praying with me? &gt;&gt; My children were saying, "Are you going to preach? &gt;&gt; Are you going to preach?" Let me tell you, if it were possible, I would preach and say, "Good night. God bless you. It would be good. What can I do if I don't preach? &gt;&gt; You get healed today. You get healed today. You go to office tomorrow who asks you, "Are you going to office? Are you going to office?" The pastor was calling me, "Will you really be able It's always been grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to take you to Hebrews here chapter 4 and verse 12. &gt;&gt; For the word of God is quick. Now in developing the quality He deals &gt;&gt; with this branch by the word because this branch is a believer. [laughter] That's why he brings forth fruit because he's a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; He allows the washing waters of the world So I know whom I'm talking to. I'm talking to the part of church that the pastor is proud of. For the WORD OF GOD IS quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. He has seen given to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow AND IS A DISCERNER OF THE thoughts and the intents of the heart. So that is the process of purging the branch. The word goes in there to divide the soul AND SPIRIT AND BEGINS to inspect that. Is there a way we can improve on the quality of production? Yes, I've been very faithful. Father, what else can I do? You see, you don't sit back. And you are so complicent. And he says, "Who doesn't know what I've been around here? I have done this. I have done this and I've done that." You can't get complicit. He says you must grow more fruit. Amen. So he concentrates on this department. Amen. He goes and brings the word to the soul and THEN BRINGS THE WORD OF SANCTIFICATION to the human spirit to keep bringing out a little bit of the dust that's on the inside. So he concentrates more on the human spirit where your daily activities are brood. Amen. And some of these ACTIVITIES ARE GOOD AND SOME OF them are bad. God must watch especially when you are that kind of of great cal. He cares so much when you he says ah which cow is that one. He says that one. [laughter] He says let me go around it. That's how God cares for the branch that brings forth fruit. There are some others they go for days without service. But when you go there without a service, he's going to look around and say, "Hey, where is Sister Har now? Because for years YOU HAVE BEEN VERY FAITHFUL, BUT HE STILL WANTS MORE FRUIT FROM YOU." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, praise the Lord. So there he does the work of checking through the activities. HE'S A DISCERNER OF THE THOUGHTS AND intents of the heart. AND NOW he works around you not by what you are doing but your intent. He doesn't want you even to error. is trying to watch. [snorts] What are your intentions in doing this? He's deleting certain THINGS THAT AFFECT YOUR CHARACTER much as you are still a fruitbearing branch. He deals with YOU IN FORM of intent. He comes and checks your human spirit. Amen. There are certain people when they do certain things maybe you will not care but when some other people they do certain things you get to get concerned because you are judging by the intent you are checking the human spirit. The purpose is to improve quality. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 13, he says, "Neither is there any CREATURE &gt;&gt; THAT is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open the eyes of him with whom we have to do." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are played. We are open and sometimes the Holy Spirit knows how to talk directly to your intentions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you are still a good branch bearing fruit, listen and change your way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we all come through the blood ping of Calvary as the body of Christ. BUT WE MUST come through this individual paging. And brother Brana related his gift of DISCERNMENT while pulling things from undercover to the people. Amen. as ping. &gt;&gt; HE HAD THE GIFT OF THE prophet and he ped the branch by discernment. But me, I am a preacher. I use the gift OF A PREACHER TO PUG the branch. There's no way you can ever get to your branch p when you don't have the confidence of the man who is the vine dresser who is going to preach her. Huh? That is a branch &gt;&gt; that does not bear fruit. Listen, &gt;&gt; brother Brham connecting his gift to Py. He says in Jesus Christ the same yesterday, he says, "Let it be known to you that the God of heaven has made himself manifest in the form of Jesus Christ and has went into glory and come back into his church as set in his church." HE SAID, "YOU ARE the branches. I am the vine. You cannot bear no fruit lest I give you the life to bear it with. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; Then he say I am the vine. YOU CANNOT BEAR NO fruit le I give you the life to bear it with you. Ah, YOU WILL BEAR THE KIND OF fruit that I p you to. SO DON'T LOOK AT YOUR BROTHER. God has pugged him in a certain way to bring that fruit. HE WANTS TO BAG YOU A CERTAIN way to bring forth a certain form of fruit. He says, "And it happened to be this discernment happens TO BE PART THAT HE PES." AMEN. AMEN. SO GOD PED HIM THAT way to produce that gift. THAT AS YOU GET UNDER THE WORD, GOD IS PUGGING YOU A CERTAIN way to bring your fruit and that's why as church you don't have that habit and don't produce that habit. I I I even don't know what he was talking about. You are not me. God talks to individual branches. If you saw nothing, I saw everything. He does the pingging by the word and HE PES IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU MAY BEAR A PARTICULAR FORM of fruit. So ping deals with natures. certain times that this paging deals with the nature that sometimes the environment has placed us into. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because once you are a doctor, I don't mean my brother here. There is a way God wants to make that crude thing sometimes. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; that your profession puts in you. He wants to pug that out that you may produce a believer's fruit, not a doctor's fruit. Our pastor is an engineer. But God pes amen that he may distill THAT ENGINEER THING. THAT THE gift of a pastor may be refined to BRING MORE FRUIT. HE WANTS to refine the character. Amen. OF THE BRANCH THAT BEARS FRUIT to a level where you become the adopted son of God in the NATURE OF GOD. AMEN. Where being a doctor. Amen. It's just a grafting. That's right. Amen. But the LIFE IS CHRIST HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You may be a mechanic, BUT THERE'S A GRAFTING. THE life is Christ. HALLELUJAH. HE SEPARATES THE SOUL AND SPIRIT AND THEN BEGINS TO GO IN THERE TO REFINE YOU that you may bring more fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He gets into our family. He begins to refine the families. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, he he goes into the young. &gt;&gt; He looks at the lives of the children. &gt;&gt; You know, he's doing what he wants to do. He wants to bring more fruit. Hallelujah. The next thing we are going TO SEE IS THAT GOD is doing the refining in our families. And the next thing he says, we've got a a special a special soul by the family and then they come forward. You know, God is dealing with them in a certain way. Then you know they take time to worship God. That's right. God &gt;&gt; is not condemning this branch. &gt;&gt; Why are you purging me? What wrong have I done? &gt;&gt; No, he's purging you because he loves more people. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; God is not condemning King Hezekiah. BUT HE SAYZEKIAH, YOU HAVE DONE A LOT, BUT I STILL NEED MORE FRUIT. SO HE SENDS PROPHET ISAIAH, GO AND TELL KING HEZEKIAH THAT HE'S going to die and let him put his family together. The man turns to the wall. HE BEGINS TO CRY. OH GOD, I have been A GOOD MAN. I have been bearing fruit. I mean, YES, GOD KNOWS THAT, BUT HE WANTS MORE FRUIT. Put your family right. HE WANTS TO SEE MORE FRUIT. HE DOESN'T ONLY WANT TO SEE THE FRUIT OF THE KING. He needs to see more fruit, the fruit of the father. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is not condemning you for the areas you've not brought fruit. He's only inviting you to a further growth. Amen. He pes fruit and he branches that bear fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So he pes fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean he pes fruit branches. Because we are in the harvest time. He pes the doctors fil out that feeling. He pes the businessmen. to filter out the feeling of you know of I am here. He purges the teacher. &gt;&gt; You know the teachers &gt;&gt; they always know everything. If you tell him something the next minute he wants to teach you. &gt;&gt; You're not pastor. It's true. But Yeah, &gt;&gt; you ask sister Maria. &gt;&gt; Sister Maria, [laughter] &gt;&gt; where is brother David? &gt;&gt; He wants to pack them. &gt;&gt; Not because they are bad people, but he wants something better. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he comes to the ministers, &gt;&gt; he wants to pack them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because this is the season of the harvest. This is the season of entering into possession. WHEN ISRAEL started out in Egypt, they needed ministers that were men of war because they were going to capture property. I mean, they were going to capture land. They were going to fight THROUGH THE PROMISE. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. BUT GOD WHEN THE TIME OF ENTERING CAME HE MADE SURE THAT ALL THE MEN OF WAR WERE GONE. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T COME IN HERE to fight in the promise. Amen. That's right. He purges everybody to bring more fruit. He needed the man of war. when the church was forming, cut out of I mean cutting out of denominations. But now we have our land and David has fought the last war against the Philistines. Amen. And just ahead of us is the kingdom of Solomon, the kingdom of peace. So he has to p the field of the ministers and filter out the attitude of war. We need the presence of mechised because he's the incoming king, THE KING OF PEACE, KING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY [screaming] I'VE NEVER FOUGHT wars here. &gt;&gt; I only preach the promises of the word because I know the season where we are. We are in the season of building the tabernacle because the master wants to come in HIS TAB. BUT LOOK AT DAVID. HE WAS ESTABLISHING a kingdom. He's a warrior. He's a man of war. When you wanted to put up the tabernacle, told him, "No, no, no, no, no. You were fighting my wars, but no, no, you cannot put up the tabernacle. God had to waste all the men of war. in the wilderness before God to get Israel into the possession. He's pinging these branches. They bring fruit. They are ministers. But he says, "Tone down. Turn down." You remember the anointing of Elijah? It went to Elisha &gt;&gt; uh and then down to uh Ju and the other one is who? &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; And this sword, &gt;&gt; they were supposed to work together. that he that survives the sword of Ju, the sword of uh Elisha shall slay. So everybody was given a field to work in. Je was given a position to be king of Samaria. Amen. Aina &gt;&gt; and then also just eliminate the family of Ahab. &gt;&gt; But he became more zealous. And he was so beyond his call. And he said, "That woman Jezebel, she brought the worship of Ba. I'm going to eliminate all these B worippers." And then he pretended, &gt;&gt; I am now one of the Bal worshippers. And all of that, you come. And there was a revival in the land and everybody WENT back again. Are you together with me? And the people came and he says now I don't want anyone who doesn't worship to mix himself with us who just coming here simply because now the king is also woring by. So they say this one does it you go out you go out he says anymore he says anymore. Then he went out and he said, "Put men at the gate with swords. Kill all these men and if [laughter] no one escapes, you are going to pay for your for his life." So there was a sling the screams and the cries and you see he went beyond his call and God was unhappy with him. There is no any other from your line that will ever sit on that throne as king. Sometimes the ministers become very overzealous. But this is the time of King Maris, the king of peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; MEN OF WAR. COULD NOT ENTER THE KINGDOM. They couldn't enter this the the the promise. So God needs to filter out any little element in the man he allows to bear fruit. I'm trying to finish. So there is a growth the church has to take. We must be a kingdom of peace. Bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Be a brother. Be a sister. God is looking for more fruit. You've done a lot of things. Thank you so much. But he says, I want more. &gt;&gt; Listen, Easter Seal of Phoenix, &gt;&gt; the pro the prophet says. Now notice he's talking about the Holy Spirit is the unesting power of your resurrection. When you receive the Holy Spirit is then growing in you the potential of it. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ALL THAT THE HOLY GHOST CAN do is already in you. HE SAYS WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT, IF THE HOLY SPIRIT BRINGS REST, the rest is in you. IF THE HOLY SPIRIT can conquer hate, then love is in you. &gt;&gt; So he comes now to deal with the HUMAN SPIRIT JUST TO IRON OUT THE FIELD THAT KIND OF BLOCK the potentials of the Holy Spirit to come to the surface. When he manages that, you will bear more fruit. Amen. So the POTENTIAL OF THE ALL THE HOLY SPIRIT INTENDS to build you into is already in you at your new birth. Amen. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN, he will keep pugging you so that more of what the spirit can do will keep coming to you. He purges you because you ARE A GOOD BRANCH. HALLELUJAH. Tell your brother I'm a good branch. The devil doesn't want to hear that. He wants you to BELIEVE YOU'RE BACK. BUT THE MOMENT YOU discover that THE GOOD BRANCH, the devil has lost the battle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet continues to say, "Amen." Notice you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. So no tree just comes up overnight. It's got to grow. As we grow in the grace and knowledge of God, you are baptized into the Holy Spirit. Now as the Pentecostal church baptized into the Holy Spirit to growing, limbs has died. Hallelujah. Because he's ping. So now let nature graft certain things there. He plants them. Hallelujah. And when those suckers go then you bring more fruit. Hallelujah. YOU ARE A TREE. THIS FIRST TIME YOU ARE BRINGING the first mango. Then you could have 10 mangoes. Maybe that's a sign you can grow more. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GROW MORE BECAUSE THE LIFE THAT YOU CAN GROW FRUIT HAS ALREADY been vindicated. Amen. HALLELUJAH. THERE LIMBS THAT ARE CUT, CIGARETTES WERE CUT, ALCOHOL, THINGS WERE CUT, &gt;&gt; WHICH IS A SIGN. YOU CAN GROW MORE FRUIT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [sighs] &gt;&gt; They were spring. They were pruning them off. But the tree is still growing. is still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection. They are led by the spirit to quicken the word to you. You who is believers. Amen. The word keeps quickening. As you come to the first limb, second limb, third limb, it just keeps quickening. The spirit of God gives preaching to you. Amen. So the I mean the pruning upgrades you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A younger tree starts with 30fold and the farmer will not blame it. He will just keep ping expecting more fruit 60fold then 100fold and then the farmer he says my God will still bring more. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. WHEN IT COMES TO 100FOLD, THEN THE farmer will just want to work with maintaining. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And also MAKING THE FRUIT OF GREATER QUALITY. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE WANTS TO PRUNE ALL OUR PAST experiences that have BECOME PAINTED FIRE. He's not interested in that anymore. OH, THE HOLY GHOST. WHEN I RECEIVED THE BAPTISM, THIS AND THAT AND THAT HAPPENED. YOU PRUNE THOSE THINGS AWAY. HE NEEDS IN YOUR EXPERIENCES. AMEN. In finishing. I just want to give you the scripture. that will keep you looking to greater fruit quality &gt;&gt; because you were created to bring fruit. Amen. John 15:16, you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. Do you believe? Do you agree with that? Why did he choose you? You didn't choose me. I chose you. You did not produce the conviction that you felt when you lifted up your hands and gave your life to Christ. &gt;&gt; I was choosing you. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain. And whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you. May God bless you. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. You were chosen to bear your fruit and that your fruit may remain. The pastor already dealt with that and it was so beautiful. May our fruit remain and increase. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just stand up and tell your brother, "Let us bear more fruit." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Dear appreciate our pastor. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I believe it has been refreshing to every one of us. The Holy Spirit has spoken to us individually. Praise the name of our Lord. Real washing. Praise the name of our Lord. Just real cleansed. Praise the name of our Lord. Each of us, we know which branch we are. And every branch has got the medicine. Praise the name of our Lord. So let us sing that song, a confession, I am blessed. Are you blessed? Praise the name of our Lord. This is a song which says I am blessed every day that I live.
