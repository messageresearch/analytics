[Music] he Aver throws the clear away [Music] and it's all because my Mighty never throws away foreign [Music] so before we start this service you know we've got a few things to take out of the way if Sister Shalom can walk to the front this is she desires to be prideful is a Hebrew blessing a Hebrew blessing that's the laying on of hands but the Gentile blessings just speak the word so I think she wants to take both don't say it I go to I love your own being amen our sister had a situation she just has you know not been able to carry a baby for nine months twice so it gets to be a point of concern yeah which I want us to join our hands together in prayer yeah so that we can claim a perfect blessing for our sisters you know children are a gift from the Lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that whatsoever the enemy has said first Lord we scattered by the power of the name of Jesus I pray that may bring a daughter and perfect healing upon our life and father that you may Grant a special blessings children come from the Lord father we ask one from you for this our sister you've done so many miraculous things [Music] I pray that to me bless ourselves and give her the grace to bring forth a baby and we believe it is because you promised him each time we pray in the name of Jesus [Music] [Music] thank you praise the Lord and then we've got one of us here again she's so smart this morning there must be a Cause she [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so this is and [Music] the two era that two come to an agreement uh they've visited the family and they allowed him to proceed [Music] and take agonists amen amen so they want to announce the agreement before you know and I want them to turn that we may pray with them [Music] precious heavenly father is Lord I bring Jenna and darkness before that they've come to an agreement which agreement father we blessed as we pray for them Lord proceeding to their wedding day we pray that you may give them more grace [Music] the glory of the father in Jesus name thank you yes sir so we proceed teaching of the word now if you can stand up and we're getting the scripture reading we shall turn to the Book of Genesis chapter 12. yeah we shall turn to Genesis chapter 12. verses one two three now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house [Music] and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing Abram was blessed to bless there's no reason why God would bless you if you cannot use your blessing to the benefit of the body amen amen and I bless them that blessed day and in this shallow the families of the earth be blessed word of prayer Heavenly Father we have read the scriptures Lord I pray as we approach the teaching that you may pick the real mind of God behind those scriptures to be the food for your children this morning I pray that the spirit of Grace that spoke to my heart Could Be The Same Spirit of Grace to receive from the hearts of the hearers bless our assembly Lord whatsoever need do we have of uh I pray that you may visit in the teaching of the world and when these people leave this place I pray that they'll be able to testify of the blessings of God I have committed this service into your hands in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated now we thank God for this day amen amen I know the weather has upset many people but I'm looking forward for a great blessing as we get into the service today amen I am a firm believer in the written word um foreign [Music] which becomes dangerous to you the word must go to the soul to be processed and then Steward as Revelation to seal you as a Believer because the processed word amen becomes perfect size the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ himself and then the streams of Grace into your mental faith that if God [Music] then upon this spiritual Revelation is where Jesus says I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen amen that's what God wants to do to run the word from your mind to this song it's only when it's in the soul but it becomes perfect faith and it becomes Revelation once it hits that spot then you are a church that's built upon the rock and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen so my title this morning is Abraham the blessing amen amen many times we talk about the blessings of Abraham but many times we forget remember that he was not only blessed but he was also a blessing what do you want to be a blessing to this church a blessing to all the families and to be blessed is not only having material things you look at a man with a nice home with a nice kind and then he said the man is blessed that's just a little bit of what blessing is to be blessed is to find God's favor in multiple ways amen that God's favor is with you in your family among your children in your business you find the hand of God with you and you see his father [Music] that could replenish and finally have dominion [Music] [Music] it belongs to you this morning amen you need to know you are not only blessed but you are a blessing amen so the greatest blessing of Abraham was in Genesis and Christo testifies of that blessing he says your shall be no more welcome to and when that happens that's the day of the Lord isn't that amen yes sir now Abraham as the prophet says he was transmitted Amen to see the day of the Lord he was out here in the valley of Chevy amen which is the King's Nails in the spirit so it was transported into the day of the Lord amen he is so King yeah Hallelujah that raises after the day of men praise the Lord after the slot of the Kings foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] who comes after all these human civilization is done and when Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees he says Abraham saw my day he saw the king of righteousness praise the Lord so the testimony [Applause] meaning that we really need to see the hand of God foreign are you together with me we need to see the hand of God now let's go to Genesis chapter 35. [Music] we are talking about blessings let's see how God blessed Jacobs amen says and God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of padanaram and blessed him God appeared God blessed he blessed Abraham he appears to jack up He blesses he appears to you He blesses thank you are you together with me so meaning that your new birth in itself is the great place because you're new balance is God appearing to you by revelationally receiving the Lord Jesus Christ and the moment you step into his presence you have stepped into blessing foreign amen Amina now look at Western here and God said that to Jacob thy name is Jacob [Music] thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob but Israel shall be thy name and he called his name [Music] Israeli you see every blessing comes with a pronouncement and this time here the blessing was the changing of the character are you together with me because we know the name speaks of characters foreign are you together with me the blessing here was the change he says I know your name is Jacob but shall never be Jacob you are going to be Israel amen so now this is the way you should understand thy character who wants to be a supplanter because that's what Jacob means shall not anymore be that of the supply but rather a character that is the praise with God it's not like out there in organizations where the blessing they are talking about is money for everybody but the Bible says and God blessed Abraham which means that blessing was not only the material feet that Abraham possesses is my example here that's the blessing God is giving to Jacob is to change his character because in the Bible the name speaks about the inbued characters and we see that we never change came to the characters we also see the change of name from Abraham to Abraham [Music] are you together with me amen from Sarah to Sarah because the name is the name is announcing a new character so when God missed Jacob which means he says this morning is now made visible by a manifestation of character that Jesus came to manifest amen amen that's John 17 6. I have manifested thy character that's why you would say uh I've been with you here and you do not know me when they said show us the father and then he says he that has seen me has seen the father because they came in my father's name so the blessings of God is Not basically money don't limit God's blessing to you in areas of financially amen we have seen our sister Shalom here in my life she desires a different form of blessing she's able to handle her life she has a good job but that's not the blessing she needs right now is the blessing to have a baby are you together and I've always told you that you see the reason why we are still here is because not every elect is born now that not every elect is Born the young ladies who are still loving babies let them ask for one from glory Lord send one by my womb amen that's what sister Shalom should do to ask for a special blessing to be a career of an elected thus finding favor with God amen that we may be able to touch those heavenly blessings in Christ Jesus so that was blessings could flow your way the man the men who are mouth millionaires they cannot go into that area That's The Preserve of the election Hallelujah is the only one who can access those Divine blessings in Heavenly places amen that is a blessed man he lives Amen to benefit others a blessed man is a chain of blessings foreign [Music] are you together with me what is it amen amen so let's look at the blessings of Abraham Galatians and verse 14. that's the blessing of vibration might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive away the promise of the spiritual through faith through Jesus amen amen so the same blessing that Abraham Isaac and Jacob and joy that's the Patriarchs now comes to be shared in by the Gentiles in Christ amen the moment you receive the blossom of the horse then that means you have received the bank amen of all blessings was blessed as Abraham I will take you to the scripture here the book of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13. in whom he also trusted that after he heard the word of Truth The Gospel of yourself [Music] believed in Christ the word of Truth is [Music] the Holy Spirit who is both the contents [Music] are you together when you receive the World by the Holy Spirit now this holy spirit is the content of all blessings and that's the same time have you received the Holy Ghost amen you have received every blessings and you have received yes so in Christ that Gentiles to the blessing of abrahamas like Abraham and you're in the mind of God before the foundation of the world but you have to wait for your season of manifestations Amen Amina you don't cry and you start saying I wish I came in the days of Jacob that was not your day this day and manifest The Blessing of Abraham amen Amina Ephesians chapter one references blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] amen who has blessed us with all natural [Applause] but the scripture testifies he has blessed you with all spiritual blessings in Christ amen amen why don't you turn and testify right I know the devil doesn't like it but tell your brothers I am blessed all of us are blessed but what we need is to catch the revelations amen amen you cannot meet God and he fails to bless him because when he met Abraham blessing can I please yes God bless you find the sugar when she met God and we serve in this woman who was uh uh you know that I mean the minister of Elisha yes [Music] how did these women get the blessings because they were in contact with God's blessed men amen you may think that I'm preaching you into a connection to me but I'm preaching about how blessed the body is [Applause] we begin to share blessings the blessings keep moving from one to another amen blessed us with those spiritual blessings I'm not blessed one man but bless us what we have is the body blessing without meaning my season Allah amen the blessings not complete without you [Applause] are you together so when you come to church and we're sharing the singing amen amen we rejoice in the preachers you release something that you are not aware of You release something that blesses who has come to church you are not being aware that there is something somebody is released and when you leave the fellowship on your way home you are not the same are you together you are not the same the different form of failure because you are blessing one another brother when we come to church everybody brings his leak of fire Hallelujah brings a great blessings [Music] [Music] for you to be blessed amen Amina we love spiritual blessings amen you see you know we we we banned ourselves together as a body to us knowing that every one of us has a special blessing from God and you know so I'm going to look very cartoon knowing you can't be me as I can't be you guys both of using of God Amen so that's why brother Branham says that's today amen the body of Christ is the fullness foreign amen Amina and this blessing does not rest with the five fourth Ministry yet this blessing here is with the entire body he has blessed us with Heavenly blessings in Christ Jesus Christ you are blessed just realized you are blessed take it up again and that ever doesn't like that I tell you that's why we should not neglect the assembling of ourselves together because each one of us is a different blessing and once we come together you are tapping into the blessings amen amen praise the Lord was a different attribute in the upper room Jones attribute towards difference attribute to us different but yet all that was a portion of the spirit of God so Joe needed poor I mean John needed James needed as they were when they stepped out of the uh foreign brother Branham says a lot of people like try to make God they see us and rebook Harmony House you know these ones actually he may not really know what Sia's rebok and Harmony House means but out there in the states these are big kilot companies and you find that you know uh see us or Republic or Harmony has got a different type of Desire of an auntie um so they bring up forms of desire and then you go on one line and you find thousands of Suits we foreign that makes everything uniform he says are you together with it yeah don't you think that you can survive on your own alone you need me to bless you okay just a matter of shaking our hearts amen amen for those people who have met God there is something that flows and blesses another brother we don't shake hands like a kind of people do just to shake your hands and have a good feeling that's not what it is you are a different type of people you come from God you carry blessing and God gave me a portion and give another brother and give the other brother look how it is a blessing for Brethren to me together in unity it's like the oil that's what it is amen amen see he makes Peter and Paul Apostles but yet they are totally different in the delivery of their Ministries all of us are part of that great mind of Eternity is different from the others and our difference is the blessing foreign others that God thinks like me and if you don't think like me you don't have God we can't narrow God like that for you that's why God deals with the body you are so narrow the what you are designed by your culture maybe was designed by your education maybe it was designed by your theological background it is so Narrows you cannot represent the entire girl so God is designed this bride with an eternal Minds and we need to look at things based on God's Eternal Minds [Music] did you hear that amen amen we need to think closer based on God's Eternal Minds because they were in him before the foundation of the world and we are manifested to think like a god amen amen when I think like a god foreign are you together with it praise God are you a Believer this morning the reason why you are a belief is because [Music] that's the Revelation you have today anybody who fails to believe it's because he does not have that Eternal element of the father amen so that's what the word teaches John chapter 5 verse 24. verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent to me has eternal life because you have eternal life [Music] in this truth amen Amina I therefore want to use this opportunity to pick ourselves from eternity this morning and bring ourselves in time to be a blessing the more the reason why you don't see this blessing is because you have never known that you came from eternity and you were blessed with the spiritual blessings before the foundations bring you out not to prove that you are cast but to prove that you are blessed and God blessed in let us pick up ourselves in the message the leadership of Covenant again is the place brother Branham says there is one form of eternal life and that comes from God and before then every creature that would ever have it okay are you together there is only one form of eternal life and God prepared Electronics I am one of those Christians one of his attributes was to begin with you amen Amina uh all you'll never be there you come forth in the burning ground of your mother your father didn't know you what about you you were in his Lord and when you come first in the burning ground of the mother then you become a human being in the image of your father now you can fellowship with him and the same thing if you got eternal life who's giving you a natural example your father didn't know you but about yakumana but because it's a natural one but God I can't understand but you are connected to him by the gene of his lawyers and once it drops into the bedding ground of your mother foreign [Music] who came from the father are you together he came prepared and blessed see I don't want you to get that portion that form of thinking that there is a special seminar into that is going to teach you in part blessings you are blessed you just need to realize it and you begin to tap into those blessings he says that little life you coming the Natural Life physical life that was by your father and the only way you can come born again is it has to be from your heavenly fathers all the father's given me will come to me you are here because your name was placed on the last book of life before there was even a foundation of the world that's exactly right you are a genius out of your heavenly father a part of God's word then you was with Jesus when he was here we don't even know because he was the way places it blesses myself to know that I was in him amen amen and that he loved you it aren't your name and then he says nothing shall separate you from the love of God that loved you even before the foundation amen so you were a part of the eternal life and you are part of the Lamb's Book of Life your name was written in heaven so and the book foreign foreign [Music] to behave like Allah not to be wild like a world that's not the life you have problems amen amen but that's part you know that part there is blackened to you that keeps connecting you to Eternity amen Amina when I come to preach here you think you're knowing something for the first time you've always known it but just the holy spirit is removing the Mist around it to light that portion of the world it's because you have eternal life from the beginning is something that doesn't begin but you just realize with the time oh thank God I didn't begin with the time I was with him before the foundation of the world amen Amina you see that element of you in the father your mind is blackened with it you just can't remember just like you can't remember when you were sacking as a baby you could never remember unless they took a video to give that Revelation to you are you still together with the meeting amen amen you were with the father for the foundation but you were just reluctant to it now the message comes to clear that mist and then you realize that's why I've always been in love with the world that there is always something that was calling to me that's the seed of eternal life that you always had amen amen First Peter 1 8. you love come on can you imagine that you know exactly but you have loved for God the god whom you've never seen and you could even give your life it's not because of your mind being brainwashed because that's not what it is it's because there is a seed on the inside foreign who struggled with this message they read the books they can go and spend a year if they have that seed they still come back here foreign come on now you see him not without yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah that's why the world thinks you're crazy because the word is preached you are throwing your hands you are singing with a lot of joy for somebody whom you've never seen sometimes you are singing like that with a lot of Trials around you but yet that thing keeps pulling on you sometimes you're rejoicing when you didn't have supper last night that is God has got a hold of you quoting things that are to be um to be a Son of God you have to be healed in him always spiritual life foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] he cannot stop it because that which you have okay Amen in Philippine language amen like a brother Branham says foreign I couldn't overcome in those other ages I couldn't have overcome in the time of Columbus this was my time to overcome are you together with me yes sir as each member came first it became expressed and it took his place [Music] you dropped from eternity of Flesh and the moment you get here start to take your position in the Bible okay you are not a stranger in the body you are not lot in Canada you are Abraham amen amen and once you are Abraham I tell you you are not going to have struggles for positions because your position is foreign um rest under the spirit of adoption truly do you want to guide you and bring you to your position in the body foreign you are different I cannot be like you when everyone else if I try to I'm failing God because I'm leaving my position amen amen so every one of us comes first as an expression of those Eternal attributes and also you bless God was not even God he was the great Eternal yeah and in there was attributes attributes was his thoughts and then became a word like this and the word expressed his word and what expressed as a food and then remember if you were ever was in God's thinking you will always be there you know hahaha oh praise the Lord that makes you special amen amen if you are an attribute of God you bring forth the spirit I mean the fruit of the spirit amen you just Express because that's what you are you get a seed of a mango in the ground it will not struggle to bear fruit and when it Bears the fruit it will not bring an apple you can't be part of the body and you are mean um everybody who touches you goes crying that's not an attribute of God on the principle God works by human embodiments so whoever you are you become an expression of God's Great thoughts you are an attribute of your father because the jam lays in the father so you are coming to express God that's why you were here I come from God look at me my life would give a testimony that's what God wants of us let us look at Peter yeah John and James all these men are the same Apostolic gifts but different Administration completely but the spirit is the same amen amen we can never be the same but yet each member in the body Ministry is a Divine gift from above seek to bless don't seek to destroy but how can you do it if you come from God the only thing you carry is to bless one another are you together with me let us learn to yield to the leadership of the Holy Spirit Into The Potter's House into different verses along the way you may sleep and fall but when the vessel is broken the sister song he doesn't throw in the clay he'll bring it back again until he gets a verse of Honor that's the sign you come from God you cannot fall and walk away you come and cry back and he'll gather back he wants to make you a better version of love strong amen he wants us that way he's a god of variety and he makes some rich foreign foreign [Music] you cannot become crazy like this present World against God makes you a woman but you want to become a man you can't be that crazy in the body of Christ we accept our positions amen amen that's where God can bless you if you just can't abide in your position the question is did you come from that eternity foreign [Music] foreign Philadelphia when not the same attributes as local churches but sometimes because we don't know how God works a man leaves this church this that church once he wants to bring the attribute of that church into this church that's not the way God works we can never be Jeffersonville it is and God has called us to express unique attributes and as long as your standards who you are wherever you go because you are yourself God wants to bless you because you are what he means you are a blessing to the body amen I mean let's go to Ephesians chapter four verse 5. the scripture says one Lord foreign we go through you know our faith is one faith our baptism is one baptism our bodies one body it is but as much as is all you know he has gifted us differently because it's the fullness but we are drops from the foreign [Applause] foreign everybody has been given something to contribute to the body okay some are committed to prayer and we thank God for that summer committed to showing Mercy we thank God for that summer blessed financially to happily bear the financial burdens of the church it doesn't make you great you are just being who you were in the face of God Amen but then there is another class of gifts to the body that Pocus gives us Ephesians 4 8. wherefore he says available I trust you brother God is good he gave talents back here is amen sometimes you may think that it's gifts to particular videos but verse 11. he says this gives son to men are given to some to bless the body okay verse 11. and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers these men here they become the gifts these gifts for the position anointed by this and masickling anointing to be distinguished from the rest of the body okay to be a minister because as the bride of Christ we are all women and women don't take a pop the only reason the fight for takes the popsicle in spirit that Christ would have done and questions foreign I'm not called to free the gods here and I will not fight God because these gods they will take the time for the ship and the Sheep is always starving because you are taking all the attention on the Gods the goats don't want to be sheep and they will never be shipped they never be obedient to the world it doesn't matter how much you preach to them so my choice is to work with the ship the ship they said Allah that the ship May manifest the ministry of Christ amen so the motive and objectives of this man will always be right foreign okay sir let's go to Revelation chapter 2 verse 5. he says remember therefore from where you have fallen it's so it's so powerful yeah you need to come to a point where you know you are standing woman [Music] because vanga the holy spirit is telling the Church of Ephesus know where you fell from a man who has never stood does not know what it means to fall a sitting man cannot fall but a standing person are you standing this morning that's a great blessing remember therefore from where you fell from and repent knowing how you deviated from the world and come back to the sport where you shifted from and do the first Works love the body be part of the church speak well about the blood of Christ and you're criticizing everybody you can never be the body is he says know where you fell from under the first works I'll come unto thee quickly and we remove thy Candlestick out of his place except you repent now there are two things here there is you the believer and then there is because it shines the light of the revelation of the word of God here what does this mean that's the ministers amen he run like this and the poor as much as you are willing to take so if the church has to be blessed the people must be like a little eaglets because when the mother and God does he goes out there he does the hunting and when they hear the mothers come down having their mouths foreign I'll take your pastor right away from you and move him out of his place I'll take him somewhere else where I will reflect my light that will shine is the candle to the local church he became a blessing to the people to the church when we learn the mystery that lays not only in the ministers but in each other amen and receive one another along those lines we shall be a blessed local church we are all special in the eyes of God and we just need to discern the body of Christ and tap into the Divine Elements which every one of us carries because [Music] it's the Fellowship of the attributes are you together with the quranism the element that comes from God that attribute drops in my heart and I surprised the Lord I'm a Son of God and the same attribute falls into this heart thank God he's the son of God so we have the fellowship not Jeremiah and Stephen but the attributes of these two here sorry it's so deep and yet so simple to understand let us got second Corinthians and we shall understand it feed that together so for a fellowship to shine cook Waka with the Light of Christ everybody needs to make sure his leak of fire is burning and when we come together the people will get healed from their diseases even without laying hands on them they've come into presence of a greater body of light and then all the darkness vanishes the Cockroaches will go away the reptiles of the night to look away the spirits that try to occupy somebody's body will go away with your mom because he has come into the presence of the Divine Light a contribution of different attributes amen amen second Corinthians up did you hear that I thought it is now we know man after the flesh you are not my friend simply because we come to the same church he says no there must be something deeper there must be a light that connects your people together foreign [Music] ah they always knew him John Peter and James and even the Peter could rebuke him but when he took them to the Mount of transfiguration and unfolded that Supernatural attribution [Music] that has got that attribution you are like a spoon of water out of the ocean that great spirit attribute of Christ is the ocean but every one of you has got a spoon of it and that's what brings our fellowship together okay amen amen God wants us to go farther than the Jordan River of water baptism he wants us to go beyond the Mount of Temptation where we overcome the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life in the power of the Resurrection Hallelujah Elijah and Moses we're there to testify of the power of the Resurrection are you together with me that's the kind of Fellowship that Fellowship Judas cannot believe he cannot be part of it that's the type of Fellowship we want that's the kind of Fellowship we need our fellowship a man with a theological understanding but we are fellowshipping with the fourth message of life foreign are you hearing what I'm saying the kind of Fellowship we need Tumblr [Music] what a fellowship that would be yeah foreign the same emotions to bring him down and release us from our born amen amen we know who we are amen Amina praise the Lord to some God that shared out these attributes in the bright body and our Brotherhood is the bond with this attribute I see some Supernatural elements that bonds me to this Brothers knowing do you think we were building an organization he says we are not building an organization I'm not here this morning it's never sent me the organizations to build individuals of Jesus Christ that there might be the PowerHouse and that Dwelling Place are you together with the man [Music] wants to make us powerhouses foreign and he says I want you to pray that the Lord May save my wife and when he came forward I shook his head just as I shook his eyes there was a power voltage and the brother wanted to put up we prayed by the time he came home his wife was asking for water baptism [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] huh ah this is the fellowship we need when I stood in the same place and you remember the sister used to come from a mother brother mungoma used to come from in wakis and they told us she is beautiful at 11 o'clock and says before the doctor touches and right there on the theater table right now and she said you give me a document to prove it as we are not going to do that but we are going to operate you someday we don't know what has happened she has never been operated amen Amina you see when we come to church we should not come just to be part of the congregations give me the grace to release my blessings to the children of God [Music] amen amen are you together with me so many things have happened by releasing that Divine attribute that's why I should not be compared to anybody I'm one of a kind and you are one of the kinds if we can really come pray that we don't understand there will always be signs Miracles people will go free we are amen I mean let's go to Matthew chapter 10. the blessing um Matthew 10 41. he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive the righteous what are you receiving you are receiving another tribute Uganda and when we receive one another and I can start saying because along that order you receive His blessings also pass a blessing to him there is something in you I want to touch this morning Hallelujah I want to touch something be kind to me release it release it towards me as I release it listen towards one another you shall not leave this place [Music] that is within us to the people amen Amina amen amen our blessing to you my brother is not the Charisma tonight amen and it's not in the impact of Our Testimony but the ability to take ourselves out of the way that God himself may have the preeminence amen amen let me show you here in second Corinthians chapter 10. about the ministry of Paulo brother Olga Paul Paolo he says I have learned the foundation is listen here what is that they are talking about him in second Corinthians 10 10. those who opposed him they say for his letters his letters for his letter I said they are weighted and Powerful but his bodily presence is weak and this is speech conceptable are you seeing the greatest Apostle in the history of the church the people say when he writes you see a powerful man but when it comes to you Boom come on Jesus Christ and he says to release that Supernatural elements are you together with me what is it Paul's bodily Praises but he was the greatest blessing to the church he had the ability to operate by the part of God which is in Hebrew are you together with me and that part and not pause the man I mean the lame to work so we need to fall back into our inner self that we can pass on the blessings sometimes we make a very big mistake we judge people that they can preach and dance and do all kinds of stuff that was not born the mystery himself was a blessing to the people just his presence would release the power of God and he says but Christ not living for it's God which worketh in you want us to Will and to do of his good pleasure to bless God's people who have answered release your blessings as we are speaking Lord release my portion of blessings not just come and listen to the Past number you bring a leak of fire that must Bless the people listen to me now David would release his Blessing by way of music are you together with me the sons of the prophets release their inner self yes he was able to prophesy and the people say is so one of the prophets also but he walked in turn assembly where the people were fellowshipping by their attribute amen I mean the Corinthian Church release the blessing of Grace until the sinner adults would take their blessing yes teaches that we should not neglect the assembling of ourselves together so this message here listen to me is not codes of conduct that how long should the woman's hair be it's more than that how long should the woman's Grace be it's more than that amen amen I live in words talk about dressing one time because the women's dresses they become tighter all the time but yet this message is not about how we must dress it's not codes of conduct so that you can tell a person that if you just stay home and you listen to the tips it's more than that because we can work once you listen to the text always the same time you are missing my leak of fire academy you are missing Beatrice's leak of fire amen I mean you understand what I mean you are missing process League of fire we need to come together Give the Lord there are no praise
