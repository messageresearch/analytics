We trust also this afternoon and that we uh we have an open heart and that we quickly come on temperature again. Amen. So that we can move. I had no time to drink this water. Brother Samson did.

And I want to speak on on on a thought. on the virtue of remembrance. The virtue of remembrance. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. The virtue, the strength of remembrance. Amen. Amen. There's strength in remembrance. There's encouragement in remembrance. Amen. Amen. And I trust we can be together this afternoon with Abraham and all the other types. We don't want to read the scriptures from this morning. But it will be in continuation. It will be in continuation. Amen. What God has done for us. So we want to go to uh um Psalm 103. I want to read uh a little bit Psalm of David. Amen. And we might see uh Jesus Christ the same yesterday also in the life of David. [Music] So we have all understood this morning. Hebrews 13:8 doesn't stand alone. Something surrounding uh Hebrews 13. Something is surrounding Hebrews 13:8. Maybe we will read it just at the end of the service so that we understand what makes him the same today. Don't we want to see him the same today? We see him yesterday. We know he will be tomorrow, but I want to see him today. Amen. Amen. Psalm 103. to read 1 to7. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgivest all thine iniquities and heal all thy diseases. [Music] who redeem thy life from destruction. Who crown is thee with loving kindness and tender mercies. [Music] Who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles. who satisfyth the mouth with good things, so that thy use is renewed as as the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And all the church said, "Amen." Amen. Amen. The Lord is good and his mercy endures for us. So don't forget all that he has done. The virtue of remembrance. Let's go to Luke 24. Luke 24. Luke 24 verse 13. We don't want to read the whole story. Maybe only two verses. And verse 13, and behold, two of them that went the same day to a village called Emmas, which was from Jerusalem about three score fur. We have to read. And they talked together of all the things which had happened. And it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. Amen. I just just want you to to focus now what is going on what Jesus is doing. Amen. Amen. First, did we have read verse 15? Yes. Yeah. 15. Okay. 16. 16. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, now catch this. He spoke to it to them. Now, what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are said? [Music] Amen. Jesus is asking a question. What are you talking about? Do you know that Jesus knew exactly what they were talking about? Amen. And yet he's asking a question. Watch very carefully what he's doing. And one of them which was Copas answering and said unto them, "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known these things which are come to pass in these days?" Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just watch now. He said unto them, "What things?" Jesus, what is he doing? What things is God not acting in a strange way? Oh, you are awake. That's fine. Right. We are right there. This can happen in our life. That God is acting unusual. He knows everything and yet he's asking. Is it not amazing? Come on church. He knows everything and yet he's asking what things and one of them verse 18 whose name was Cleopas answering oh no which is okay 19 is this and they said unto them concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and rulers delivered him and condemned him to death and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should be have redeemed Israel and beside this to the day the third day since the things were done. Okay, go and read it. Oh [Music] [Music] so far. So now they are explaining they are explaining to Jesus what Jesus knows already. You You're with me? Amen. What a what a what a strange action of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ. Yes. The same yesterday. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my my my. Can we identify him already now in our lives? Sometimes it's so strange what God is doing. But he's doing it for a purpose. Hallelujah. Uh let's only read one verse, verse 27. Listen very carefully now. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. he's doing now. You know what he's doing? He's remembering them for all the things that has happened. Let us pray. We want to be remembered in prayer this evening. Amen. Amen. Heavenly Father, Father, we have gathered together here. May you allow us for just a couple of minutes. Enter into the sinful, oh God. Enter into the drama that you have ordained that you have predestinated. Help us, Father, to do what we have to do to stay where we have to stay. in our position where you have placed us, Father, and reveal your word on us. For we pray it for your honor, for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. May be seated. And we want to speak on the virtue of remembrance. Remembrance because if we are remembered, it starts stimulating something. It's a it's a terrible thing if we forget. Forgetting what God has done leads you into confusion. [Music] It leads you into confusion. David when he wrote the psalm and he would tell us forget not what he has done. David knew what he was talking about. David came to places in his life and he had for he had seemingly forgotten all that God has done for him. Remember when when there was a time when we can read in the Bible and here we want to come a little bit to our subject already. Amen. To to see what God wants us to do in this last hour. Amen. God wants us to do what we can do. He never wants you to do something you cannot do. Amen. He He wants you to have faith that you can have. He wants you to have faith according to the measure that he has given to you. He never wants you to have something that he has not given unto you. Can we say praise the Lord? Hallelujah. Amen. So God knows exactly what he has given you. Amen. God knows exactly what you need. All what you need, God has given to you for your life journey. In Christ, all things are granted unto us. Amen. Amen. But as we was reading here, this actually this scripture about the Emo's disciples. Now maybe special first David you know David came his in his life and David you know David had that that uh uh it was passed he was already crowned king. Amen. Oh, so remember all the time the prophet coming to the house of Jesse, David being anointed, David, David growing, David killing Goliath, that was all behind him, war that had all happened over there. David was king over Judah. David was king over Jerusalem. Amen. Amen. All that has happened. Amen. All that has happened. He was in position and then it came a time you know when he wrote this psalm it had a purpose that he wrote it a purpose telling us don't forget his benefits and I want to let you know this evening don't forget what God has done for you always remember yourself what God has done for You always bring that up. Always allow the Holy Spirit. There's a virtue in remembrance. Remembrance stimulates you. Amen. Remembrance quickens you. Remembrance gives life. When you know what God has done to for you, it satisfies you. If you are looking for something, if you're really hunting for something, first remember what he has already done for you because that satisfies you. You understand that? That gives you peace. That gives you peace in time. When you when you are in the midst of the stone and remembrance comes to you that he saved you out of a stone, it doesn't matter how big the stone is. You know, he saved me out of this storm. That gives you peace in this. Amen. Amen. And David wrote this. You understand the Bible would say, we if we don't turn to it, but I think it is in first kings or or no, in first Samuel. It is 1 Samuel. Don't turn to it. You can read it at home. 11 after you know when David wrote this psalm don't forget what God has done for you he that heal our our diseases amen when David wrote that psalm he came out of a great trial and he came great out of a great great uh um uh big big problem that he had brought himself into by forgetting what God has done. Now remember, David was king. Goliath had happened. Goliath was killed. And you know, David didn't didn't kill Goliath. It was God doing through David. David understood. I had no strength to throw the stone. David actually saw the stone coming down. As David threw the stone, he was too weak. He had no no strength. But when the stone came down, the Holy Spirit get under the stone. And the Bible said the stone went into the forehead of Christ and he stuck. You know how much speed it must have been to that the stone stuck in his head. So David understood. This was the Lord's. This was not my strength. Not by not by might not by strength but by my spirit says the Lord. So we have to remember ourselves. Now as David as David all of this had happened and David came David was anointed king the Bible said there came a certain time when the kings went to battle you can read it in first Samuel 11 there came a certain time when all the kings went to battle but David decided to stay home. David decided not to go. David decided to stay to stay at home and there is where he fall with Baja. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh, you know what? David was king, anointed king. It was his duty to lead the group into battle. That was not a great work. That was just his duty as king. But he neglected his duties. And because he neglected his duties, the form with Bacha came. And when David came out of it, you know how that hurted David. Hallelujah. And always when we neglect our duties, it finally hurts us. It weakens us. You understand? We don't have time to go into it, but just to show you David was anointed king. So, so it was not a special thing. He just should lead the group. That was his kingly duty. Amen. And because he neglected that, he fell with Bashibba. And you know how much that weakened David? You know how much that because now David remember he sp he spoke his own judgment when the prophet came to when the prophet came to his house. David spoke his own judgment and Satan was hunting him showing him what he has done. And remember, David became so weak because of the mistake even was counting the people. He became so weak that he was counting the people. Satan told him, he said, "You know what? You have done such a great mistake and and my goodness I think you have lost all your strength. You have lost everything who you are. So you need you need to be sure how many people you are still with you. So you better count how big is your church still? Do you go is your church still small or is only a small church. Brother, sister, the size of the church. It's never important how big the dog is. It is important how big the fight in the dog is. But you understand how David became so weakened that Satan could tell him, "Count your people." And you know how God get upset. He he said he said to David you have done a terrible thing. He said terrible thing. You have counted the people. Is that right? And you know the judgment that came out of it all because David had forgotten what the Lord has done for him. Allow me to go that line. Why was God upset? Why was God upset with David counting the people? He said, "David, you have done a terrible thing. Now you can choose. This trouble, that trouble, or that trouble. Why was God so upset?" Why was God so upset? You know why? David had lost his faith in what God said he was. Do we still have faith? What God said, we are. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You understand that? So David had not lost confidence in God. He was trusting God. He had not lost confidence in God. But David, David had lost confidence in what God said he is. You can follow me. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And if we do wrong things, we lose confidence in what God said we are. Amen. Amen. And you understand it all came from forgetting what God has done. That's why I have the great privilege this evening. to remind you all the things that God has done for us. And I I was sure as I remind you, he that heal all of our diseases. Can I see your hands that God is still a healer? [Music] Can you see your hands? When God healed you, never forget. Never forget and he is a healer of your life. Regardless of the circumstances you are in, regardless of the sickness that you are fighting, remember that he is a God that heals all of our diseases. There's a virtue in remembrance. Virtue in remembrance. Amen. And David had understood as I has forgotten. Look where I landed. I landed in doubting myself. I so little confidence in who I am. Yet God said who I am. But because of my mistake, I lost all my confidence. Come on, church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do we still believe what God said about us? Do we still believe? Do we still believe the Bible says there will be a bride without spot and wrinkle? That's me. That's me. This is what he said about me. It is not important what I think about myself. It is important what he is saying about me. This message declares what God thinks about you. When you think you are from Uganda, God said no, you come from heaven. [Applause] Hallelujah. If you wake up in the morning, look into the mirror and you said, he said, "That flesh is me." God said, "No, that flesh is not really you. The inside is you. [Applause] Can we say praise the Lord? Amen. Church is so important. There's such a virtue of remembrance. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And as we and David understood it. He understood why he landed in that condition where he was total doubt in himself. He became so weak that he spoke to one of his generals. Can you not count the people that is still with us? We have to fight against kings and kingdoms. How how great is our is it not sometimes that we look into our church how many people are still there. Oh, we rather go we rather go to the bigger church than the smaller. Is that right? Come on, church. Amen. You understand? But David came and God was so upset with him. God said, "David, have you forgotten Goliath? Who was that?" And David said, "That was you." What do you think about? It was always me because you are my partner. So God was so upset because David has lost the confidence. in who he was. Church, have we lost confidence? And what the word said we are. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If we are one or two or 10 or 20, who cares? [Music] If the whole world is against us, who cares? If they close this church down, who cares? If I'm left alone, who cares? With God, all things are possible. With God, all things are possible. If I'm tomorrow alone at home, who cares? Amen. Come on, church. I don't know how to say. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. David understood. You're with me. [Applause] For forgetting who you are. Forgetting what God has done brings neglecting your duties. Because if you if you if you forget what God has done, the motivation goes down and then we neglect our duties. We just find an easy way. Like David when the when the kings were meeting for battle, he should have been in the forefront leading Israel into battle. That was his normal duty. Is that right? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But he neglected that. And out of neglectings of duty, you understand what God is doing today. What does God is doing tonight? Allow me to read you to you a a a statement of the prophet [Music] out out of out of the message. This day the scripture is fulfilled. [Music] The last page. He said, "I have read the scripture with dozen or more evidences that we're living in the last day that the generation remember this morning. There's a generation left. You are that generation. If you're calculating this, you see there's one generation missing is placed for you for this last generation. The generation that will Jesus Christ see Jesus Christ return to earth. And I say to you tonight again this day this scripture is fulfilled. So Jesus Christ can I remember you? Can I put you into remembrance that Jesus Christ came back to earth again? Amen. We are not looking for his coming. We are waiting for the going. Because brother said, "My ministry is to declare him. He is here now. [Applause] I want to put you in remembrance. The second coming is going on. Amen. Amen. Can we say praise the Lord? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I want to remind you, you are a part of that coming because the second coming will be a mysterious coming. He will come as a thief. Is that correct? Son of man will come as a thief. When a thief comes, what is he coming for? The thief is coming for the most valuable thing that is in your house. So when the son of man comes as a thief, the most valuable thing on earth is the bride of Jesus Christ. I want to remember you. You have value in the sight of God. That's why he came to you. You have value in God's sight. You have value. Regardless if you are black or white, boy or girl, married or unmarried, minister or leoty, you have value in the sight of God. Come on, church. Hallelujah. You have value. That's why I want to encourage you. Don't try to be somebody else. Be what you are. Be a Christian. Hallelujah. If you have time this evening, we go shortly to a few things to show that God needs you. the way he he orchestrated you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I want to encourage you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't be up. Don't be sad with your situation. Amen. Serve God. Wherever you are, whoever you are, as the sisters, the sisters again, sing the song. Worship him. Whoever you are, wherever you are and what condition you are in, if you are sick, worship him. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you are worried, worship him. [Applause] Hallelujah. I want you to reme I want you to remember you now as we want to take that story we have seen with David how David understood how important remembrance is amen and you know follow the principles of the Bible [Music] Oh, I think it's so beautiful. We was reading this morning. We was reading about Abraham unconditional covenant and yet he had to do things. Amen. Amen. My my I I pray that the Lord helps me and you to enter into this. Amen. Amen. Who's ready for it? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Watch. Watch with Abraham and Sarah. Now here Elohim comes Elohim comes to Abraham [Music] and and Elohim has disguised him. Brother Brandon would tell us he told two other angels, "Let's go down." And he made himself a body the come into it and it came down to earth in flesh. Is that right? But now this was not naked flesh. It was closed. [Music] Had they dressed like brother Ibalis maybe or maybe like brother Samson or maybe like your dress or maybe my dress if I go outside here on the streets of Ginger. Even if I would paint my face, the people would know I'm not an African. Even if I would paint myself pitch black, the people when they look at me, they see my clothing, they see my actions. That's not an African. You're with me. So they would understand that I'm a stranger. Watch now. Watch now. As Abraham was sitting in the tent door, Sarah was at home in a very bad situation and she had forgotten all that God has done for her. She had become old. She was grumpy. Every day she had a fight with Abraham. You might believe it. This is what brother Random said. Lot of fights at home because she was tired of waiting. [Music] Remember when Elohim told her, "You will have a son." telling to Abraham wife Sarah will have a son. She said me an old woman. Come on in this condition Sarah was happy home. You're with me now. He was Abraham one church just just to show you This is our normal life. Situations come that we don't expect not running the way we want them to run. Sometimes frustration in our home, sometimes frustration in the church. Is it right? Yes. Now Abraham was sitting in the tent door, not in the cool of the evening, but in the heat of the day. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You get the picture. You get the picture. Suddenly he see three men walking. He's sitting there in the tent door watching the people. He was watching the people and suddenly saw three people. The Bible said he saw three men and they were certain way closed. They had a certain dress on. So when he saw them, he understood those guys are strangers. You understand that? Remember on the way to Emos? Here was Jesus walking with his disciples. You understand? A day before they had fellowship with one another. Now he had a different dress on. Amen. Yes, sir. And he's asking questions, why are you sad? No. If I would ask brother Samson, what is your name? What is your name? Samson. I know, but I still ask him. You get the picture, church. Jesus is acting. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, "What's wrong with you? Why are you so sad? Listen to what they said. Are you the only stranger? So watch. Listen, church. Very important. Come on, church. Oh, there's something good coming up, I tell you. But we want to do it as a little drama. This is our life. Many times our life is like drama. But you know what? God loves drama. God loves drama. When all beauty was in Eden, [Music] he allowed the serpent to come in. Uh-huh. God loves drama. God loves drama because in drama he can show who he is. Hallelujah. Are you the only one? I see your clothing. Yes. And your reaction. It looks like you weren't here the last couple of days. You should be a stranger. Is it not amazing? Why did Jesus not say, "Hey, brothers, it's me." He's playing. [Music] Hallelujah. Can we say praise the Lord? Why is God not coming straight to you telling you it's me and you are that you are the bride? Why is not God doing that? Because he loves drama. Yes. My God loves drama. He likes to come on the water. And the same people that had fellowship in couple of hours ago say it's a ghost. It's a ghost. It's me. It's me. [Laughter] [Music] Watch, watch. Now you understand that said, "Are you the only stranger?" And Jesus acting stupid said, "What do you mean? Tell me." Yeah, you know about Jesus and he was standing there. You understand? Come on, church. So blind. Blinded by circumstances. How many time? How many times we are blinded by circumstances? It is the Lord the whole time. just acting out his drama, just acting. He wants you to be a part of it. It's the time is over for just sitting in the church seat. It's time that you become active in the drama. God is calling you into the drama now. No, I don't know. Strange. Tell me about this about we thought he is the Messiah. Why we have seen we thought we thought he would just destroy Rome and there was some strange we have some strange sisters in our church. They started the new doctrine that that he is risen. What do you what do you think about it? You understand that Jesus is saying that's strange. [Music] [Laughter] Can we give him a hand of praise? This is our God. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. I can I can imagine now this is our God right. I can imagine Abraham. He was now happy father of Isaac. Isaac was six years old and he was playing and he was so happy. And one day the Lord said, "Abraham," he said, "Yes, Lord." Abraham, take thy son, thy only son, "Take Isaac, and sacrifice him to me. You're joking." What did Abraham say? He said, "Yes, Lord. Come on, church. You know who was confused? Hell was confused. All the demons that was trying to get Abraham away from the promise. was going to the big boss and saying, "Have you heard?" And Satan said, "I don't understand it myself." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, we serve a wonderful God. Church, I believe we are here in Africa and you are very emotional people which I really which I really enjoy. You can say praise the Lord because God is doing a miraculous work in this. It should not confuse us what God is doing as the royal seed of Abraham. It should not confuse us what God is doing right now. It should only confuse hell. What God is doing [Music] [Applause] Follow the story. We agree quickly. We go quickly. It's beautiful. Now, Abraham also Abraham sitting at the tent door and he's watching. You know, he's looking out for what? For what? Is Abraham looking out? Why is he sitting in the studio? He's not laying on his bed. He's not meditating. He's sitting and looking because Abraham had something to do. You have something to do. You have something to do. It is not a condition. The covenant is without condition. Hallelujah. The covenant is without. But you have something to do because you are God's partner. That's why you have something to do. My wife is my partner. Amen. She brings life to earth. She is manifesting me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. As a bride of Jesus Christ, you are bringing life to earth. You are manifesting Jesus Christ. You are the living manifest manifested word of Jesus Christ. You give God a voice. You give God a chance. You are the chance of God to manifest himself. I trust you're with me. Abraham was sitting there in the tent door watching. So all the people coming by said, "No, no, no. Are you bit low? Are you bit? Yes. Yes. He stood up, run to him. You know that brother Brandham said in the beginning, Abraham saw three. As he came closer, he understood it is the Lord. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're there. You understand? When Abraham started walking to invite them, he didn't know it is the Lord. [Applause] Faith cometh by hearing. and hearing by the word of God. Amen. You you drama. Abraham is looking at the crowd. He said, "No, no, no." Suddenly his eyes fell on three. Oh, he he stood up and he is going towards them. And as he comes closer, it's the Lord. As you do what you can do, the Lord will reveal himself to you. [Applause] Brother, sister, preacher, no preacher, wife, housewife, widow, orphan, widow, orphan. Amen. Come on, church. Regardless who you are, as you do what you can do, he's unveiling himself. Oh, I trust I can encourage you. Don't let Satan, don't let the internet, don't let the world define you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Okay, we Okay, don't let somebody else tell you who you are. All usually it's it's very funny today. If you come to Germany, you find many people, they have my skin and they they lay in the sun. They burn themsel just to look at you look. [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] It's crazy actually. And over the next winter season they become white again. Then they spend a lot of money to come be a little bit more like you are. And here here I see people in Africa. They're giving out money to become white. [Laughter] Come on, church. Who tells you what you must be? Come on, church. Today we have a certain kind of ideology about what a woman should look like. Who is who is defining? Who's telling what is really? You understand this? And today many girls and I know it's also coming in Africa. Many young girls, they're trying to be like something that somebody pointed to them. They go through they go through operations to be to have a certain form. Who told you? Who told you? You know God said to to Eve, "Who told you that you are naked? Who told you that you are naked? Who is defining you? You understand that? And today today by this media there's a great pressure on people. Come on. The great man of the Bible, great David was a little fellow a mommy's boy. Remember when when Samuel came to look who will be a king? He saw what did he saw? The first one he looked like a real guy. Very simple. What did God say? It's not the outside that interested. It is the inside that I trust you say shot with me. It's beautiful. [Music] God needs you the way he made you. My we see that in the Bible in a couple of minutes follow that principle. Now here we saw we saw uh Jesus and the disciples of Emmas [Music] and we saw we saw Abraham. Watch now. Watch. Abraham, he understand they are strangers. He stand up. He goes to them. And as he came closer, that's brother so and so. It's my lord. Oh, I came here to invite you. Would you come home with me? So simple. So, so simple. Every one of us could do that. Amen. Is that right? Every one of us could do. Is that correct? Watch what he's doing. As they are coming home, the Bible said he run to Sarah. Said Sarah. Stop. Stop murmuring. Tomorrow you can be said again. Come. Come quickly. Tomorrow you can be depressed again. Not quickly. Come quickly. Make something. Make something to eat. Oh my my my. You see, he never asked her to pray. He never asked her to fast. He never asked her to do magic. He just asked something of her that she was able to do. Very sorry. So God is not asking you for something you cannot do. [Applause] He's only asking you for something he know you can do. [Applause] Understand church. Understand something. What was Abraham doing? What was what was what was Jesus trying to do? Now you read with me Leviticus. Let's go to quick to Leviticus. Leviticus 19. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. My my my. You're with me still in the drama? the drama of your own life. If I can ask you this, everyone has a story. We have all kinds of people here. All kinds of of of circumstances. People here that lost their husband or lost their wife. Maybe are grown orphan. Maybe we are handicapped all kinds of circumstances. Is that right? And many circumstances are dramatic and God loves drama. [Music] Can we say praise the Lord? Let's go to Leviticus. [Music] Leviticus 19. We want to read verses 33, 34. Watch now. what God is telling to the Israelites, to his people. Okay, you with me? And this is not a condition. This is a duty. And if a stranger sold with thee in your land, You shall not vex him. You shall not vex him. 34. But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself. For ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God. [Music] Amen. Amen. You understand? Abraham knowing that his daily duty was to take care of strangers. His daily duty was to help strangers. That's why when Elohim came to Abraham, he has dressed himself and he looked like a stranger. Come on, church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my my my my my Why was was was was Jesus acting so strange to the disciples playing stupid. So they said that's a stranger. and a stranger we have to entertain. You understand that? Come on, church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] You understand what he's doing? Oh my. I trust we can see that how God is creating circumstances to involve us into his plan. Because you know why? Because you are his partner. My You understand? And now he's speaking to them. And the virtue of remembrance brings all the things back to the memory. Oh yes. Oh, this this happened in our day. Remember in the temple? Remember in the temple? when the when the when the the scribe gave him the scroll remember he said this day the scriptures they said ah yes yes that happened in our day God sent a prophet Malachi 4 came our hearts are restored back I want to remember you this evening. What has happened in our day [Music] as they were just their hearts were burning. How much God has blessed us in this church. Count the blessings. Name them one by one and find out what Jesus Christ has done for you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We should be the happiest people on the face of the earth by the things that God has done for us. He came down and asked you to marry him. Can we say praise the Lord? What does it mean? That means I must be the bride. Oh, young people, don't let that slip. Don't declare is just as a doctrine. Oh. Young people don't let that slip, don't just see it as a doctrine of a church. Christ who is our life came back to church. Christ our life came back. Paul would say, I think it was Paul said when Christ who is our life Christ our life came back Christ your life came back [Music] young people don't let the world don't Let some doctor with a PhD [Music] define you [Music] what you should be. Let the word of God define you. [Applause] Who tells you that with paint you are looking better? [Music] Who tells you? I won't let you know with pain. You are looking ugly. [Applause] Who who tells you? Who said that paint makes you beautiful? [Music] Who is defining beauty to you? Come on. Hallelujah. Amen. Well, who is defining a man? [Music] This modern world? Are you a man when you look like the great ones in this earth? [Music] Come on, young young brothers. You don't need to have a chest like whosoever. [Applause] Who? Who told you that? Who told you that this is beautiful? those guys with these big muscles. You know when they become old, you know how terrible that looks? All the things that is here is now [Applause] what I what I want to say what I want to say. Who is defining? Who is defining beauty? Come on, church. Young people, don't be deceived. Hallelujah. My my my my my You know when Eleazar he was looking for a bride He was looking for, you know, a model. [Music] No, forget about He was not He was not looking for blonde hairs. [Music] He wasn't looking for black hair. [Music] Come on, church. Watch. Oh, beautiful. The pro the prophet said he was looking for character [Music] [Applause] and your character is identified as you do what you can do. Is that simple enough? Your character is identified if you do what you can do. Now watch. Very very nice. Very nice. Here you can stand. No problem. You know don't otherwise you don't walk too much. Rebecca came out. He wasn't looking at her statue. He wasn't looking how long the dress was. Mhm. Come on, church. But what was he looking? No, the bride is on st. You know what he asked her? Can you give me something to drink? That was the question. And the mystery was the unspoken mystery of her calling. Come again. unspoken mystery of her calling. [Music] You know what Alaza had said? Lord, the first damsel that comes out, the first virgin that comes out in those days, you could see there are still virgins. You could see in that right today, it's difficult to find. In those days you could find it out. Listen what Eleazar is saying. You have you have few minutes time. Is that the first damn that comes out church? is bride bright qualification. Do you do you want to be the bride of Christ? Here one is a qualification standard. Abraham looking for blonde hair or Elazar wasn't looking for black blonde brown. Abraham was not looking for size, figure, for height, how big, how small, how fat. No, [Applause] sister. Sister, who tells you that you are too fat? Come again. Who tells you that you are too big? Who tells you is there in the Bible a certain KG a certain KG that that you shouldn't pass. [Music] brothers. There will be big brothers going in the rapture and small brothers. Is that right? Come on now. He bride qualification. Abraham said, "Lord, the first damsel, the first virgin." And in those days, you could see if somebody is a virgin or not. If they were married, they was wearing a certain sign like a wetle ring. But in those days, it was on the head. So everyone everyone could see that girl is not married yet. He said, "Let the first unmarried girl that comes out and I ask her for a drink." What? That's all. That's all. And then he said, "And she would give my camels. But I don't tell her what you mean. This is all. This is all of bright qualification. Giving water and feeding the camels. He never asked her, "What church are you from? [Laughter] Are you from my church? Then you are in the bride. Stop that. He never asked that. He never asked from what church are you coming. He saw said she is a virgin. Is that right? Amen. And he said, "Can you give me a drink?" And then she said, "You know," she said, "Yes." And by the way, I'm used this is my this is my daily. This is my daily duty. I'm used to feed camels. And he and she said and I will not only give you but I also your said I found the bride that's her that is the bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. Glory. Circumstances. Listen. Circumstances had made her still a virgin. Sisters, don't feel bad if you are still not married. Oh my, if you had time, we would go into it. But you understand circumstances had kept her in the position of not being married yet. Amen. So Elaza said, Abraham said, I want you to pick up a virgin. Oh my my my my my. And you understand what she was doing to prove that she is the cold bride. Not a magic thing. Just things that was her duty. You get that my Jesus just said, "Okay, my friends, we became friends on the journey. It was nice talking to you, but I have to go. But I have to go. I have to go. It's late. I need to go somewhere. God bless you. Goodbye. Said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. Stay with us." Because it is our duty to take care for strangers. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. I will shock you. You know what saved Lot? Amen. You know what saved Lot? So even if you feel you are lot [Music] some sometimes the devil makes us feel [Laughter] sometimes the devil makes us boy you are you are a hair in the soup you are trouble to Abraham's royalty you are just Lot I want to encourage you. Just do your duty. You know what Lot did? Come on. You know what Lot did? He was entertaining strangers. You remember Sodom? When the angels came to Sodom, he was the only one that said, "Come in. Come in. Come in. You are strangers. Come into my house. You know why he did that? Because it was his duty. Is it not simple? [Music] Come on, church. Give me two or three 10 minutes. Sorry. Now he said come we invite you because God has told us because we our fathers were strangers. We know how it is to be strangers. Are we not here? We are strangers and pilgrims. So and and they said you know stranger our forefathers there were strangers in Egypt and God told him that they should host strangers. This is the only thing that we can do. We have no much money. We have not a church to bring you but we can invite you. Oh, okay. Jesus said finally. Okay. Okay. It's nice. Thank you. Brother Brandham is telling the story. These two Cleopas and his friends was inviting Jesus in. And normally the one that is inviting is sitting in himself at the head of the table. But Jesus who is invited straight away takes the lead. Yes. When do you do your duty automatically he takes control of your life. You understand that? And he was sitting at the head of the table and Cleopa said to his strange we invited him. [Music] God loves drama. Now the the the owner of the inn is coming with bread. He's coming with bread. Puts it on the table, you know. And Cleopas, he was the oldest. Is that okay? Let me let me let me at least pray. He just want to take the bread. Jesus takes the bread. They look at him and say, "Don't don't be surprised that he takes control of your life." If you are just doing what you can do, don't be surprised when he takes full control of your life who want him this evening to have full control of your life. Then you do what you can do. You do your normal duties. Can we say praise the Lord? They looked and said, "Do you understand that?" He said, "No." And he takes the bread. He blesses the bread. And I and I believe those disciples when they prayed, they was watching and praying. So he takes the bread, he blesses the bread, he breaks the bread, [Applause] their eyes is open. Revelation strikes them. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Revelation strikes you as you allow him to have control in your life. [Music] Hallelujah. Don't you love the Bible stories? This is real life stories. This is real life stories. Hallelujah. And they walk back. They have a testimony. He is alive. They went to Mary Magdalene. Said, "Sorry, Mary. We didn't understood what you were saying. We thought it's a wrong doctrine." But no, he is alive. He is risen. [Applause] So simple. 5 minutes. We close at We close at six. Is it okay? Is it still okay? Watch. Watch. Now it becomes serious. Now it becomes very serious. There was a prophet I think his name was Elijah in circumstances had made the water to run out and the food didn't You with me? Now it becomes serious. Now Elijah is looking to do now. You know what God is telling him? Go to Sarapat. Go to the village of Saripat. You with me? God said, "I have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee." Can I tell you something? God needs widows. God needs widows in his drama. [Music] Is it amazing that God said, "I have commanded a widow woman." [Music] And she did know nothing about it. We are closing with this. How did God command? He allowed circumstances in her life. He allowed circumstances in her life. Now, her husband had died. [Applause] Keep in mind There is a duty for Israel and that widow woman knows that. [Music] Come on. What God commanded that widow woman and never told her. So God can command you to have purpose and never tell you. We are closing. As Elijah came to that Sarah, he saw a woman outside. If she would be married, she would not be outside. But because now she was a widow woman, she had to take care of her body. And remember here she was just doing and finding something for the last meal. Elijah comes and what is he saying? She looked at him and she understood that he is a stranger. He's not from this village. When he said, "Give me a drink," it was a duty for her. You get that? And as she wanted to follow that duty, he said, "And not only make me also something." She said, "I have nothing." He said the meal if you just follow your duty. If you just do what you can do and I will do what you cannot do. You understand that? You understand? You understand the principle. We close with Hebrews 13. Hebrews 13. Can you bring that up? As we said this morning, Hebrews 13 doesn't stand alone. [Music] Let's go to Hebrews 13:1. Let brotherly love continue. That's not a condition. That's a duty. Watch Paul. Verse two. Now, is that not amazing? What makes him Jesus Christ? is the same today. What did Paul say? Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unaware. Let's go to verse three. Remember them that are in bonds as bonds with them, and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body. Verse [Music] four, marriage is honorable in all and the bad be undefiled, but whom mongers and our daughters God will judge. Let your let let your conversation be without co in this and be content with such things as you have. For he said, "I will never leave neither forsakes thee. [Music] I want you I want you to stop quickly here. This is all things we easily can do. Let's go to let's go to verse seven now. Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose face follow considering the end of their conversation. Now the next verse, [Music] we want to read it together. Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever. [Applause] God bless you. [Applause] Hallelujah. Let us stand together and let's just just tell him that we love him. Do you know the song? There are no words to tell you how I love you. No words to tell you how I love you. Okay, we sing it on the other side then together. Amen. Just let's pray together. And why don't you tell him? [Music] Hallelujah. We have so many reasons. 10,000 reasons to thank him for. What has he done for us? How many times he has healed us? How many times he has comforted us? How many times he has revealed himself? How many times he has protected us? How many times [Music] so much to thank him for. Let's just use this few minutes personally. You each and everyone just thank him.
