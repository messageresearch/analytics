Pastor James is not around with us he's traveling from the sides of Cala and said we keep him in prayer amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen there is no other place that is good for us to be but in the presence of God Amen and I'm also glad tonight that I'm going to speak to you amen I'm not going to speak anything else because there is no other name that is worthy of speaking but the name Jesus Christ amen and there is no other message that is wor they preaching but the message of Jesus Christ and I'm glad that God has allowed me to come and speak the message of Jesus Christ amen so turn with me to the book of Zarah chapter 14 and read out a few verses there amen Zariah Zaria chapter 14 the Lord comes and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses refold and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those Nations as when he fought in the day of battle and it shall come to pass verse six in that day that the light shall not be clear nor [Music] dark but it shall be one day we shall be known to the Lord God to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light may God bless the word we've read we may be seated amen we are depending upon the mercies of God to speak the message tonight amen and as I speak you inter seed for me amen that I may stay in the mind of God to deliver the mind of God for tonight amen that's very important so we've read from the book of Zariah about the day of the Lord amen and the Bible says it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor praise the Lord but it shall be one day we shall be known to the Lord nor day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening at evening time it shall be light amen so for my title this evening I called it stay true to God's word stay true and faithful to God's word praise the Lord for God has promised us that there shall come a day and in that day it shall not be day nor night but the assurance that we have in that day praise the lord we know that it shall be the day of the Lord and in that day it shall be an evening time and in that evening time it shall be light amen the light that shall shine hope upon those that wait upon the Lord the light that brings hope to those that have been waiting for the day of the Lord praise the name of the Living God the light that brings life to the souls that are waiting upon the Lord in the evening time after the Lord has fought the Battle and it is all w of the evening time praise the Lord that light shall prepare the coming of the Lord that light praise the Lord prepare us It prepares the faithful It prepares those that are waiting upon the Lord do have the Hope waiting in expectation for the coming of the Lord that light shall shine hope upon them that is the light of a confirmation that the day of the Lord is come praise the Lord so stay true and faithful to the hope that we have received to the hope that we have received in the word praise the Lord when when in the book of second Timothy CH 2:15 the Bible says St to show yourself approved unto God a Workman that needes not to be ashamedly dividing the word of Truth praise the Lord instructing us to study the word praise the Lord so we come into the full knowledge of the Revelation and of God to help us to get into the truth to show yourself approved unto God a Workman that need not to be ashamed amen that does not need to be ashamed but rightly dividing the word of Truth raise the living B so how do we stay true to the word of God how do we stay faithful to the word of God as we are waiting upon the coming of the Lord which we know it is at hand how do we stay faithful and true to the word of God the say study to show yourself approved unto God what should we study the word of God praise the name Living God this is the light that we have in the evening time the revelation of the word of God for our day it is the light that illuminates our path it is the light that shineth upon our faith to give us the Hope praise the Lord for that that we are waiting for the coming of the Lord the day of the Lord study the word study the message have a continuous fellowship with the Holy Spirit praise the Lord so that you you study and show yourself approved God so now when we practice that which we have have believed in studying the word and remaining in fellowship with God praise the Lord that is the Revelation praise the Lord that shines hope upon our faith for the day of the Lord to have the faith to believe that we are living in the days of the coming of the Lord praise the Living God amen am amen as you wait for another mic let's start the book of Psalms 23 verse 6 the Bible says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever 23:6 surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever the that's the Revelation that David received about the secret of staying through staying in the word of God he says goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever praise the Lord so now I want us to look at a few characters of men and women who have stood true to the word of God who have been faithful to the word of God right from the Old Testament so we notice a number of characters who plac their lives as a stepping stone for Glory of the kingdom of God and never sympathized praise the Lord with themselves with what surrounded them not even the failures around them that did depart them from the words no frustration theyed their attention not even sickness not even betroyal stood in their way with God praise the Lord and we want see the real that God has for those that stay true and faithful to his word praise the Living God so we have a man a blessed man blessed of the Lord committed himself to the services of God faithful and sincere praise the Lord then we notice that despite his faithfulness there was a tragedy that H the house of job praise the so now when it hit the house of this does not mean that God was not present with job God was still present and watching over job we know what scripture tells us about we know that it is God who allowed Satan to come and attack job why because God was very sure who job was before him job was a faithful servant job was a man who had been tested and he was found faithful noticed that job had received a an assurance of what he had believed and what he stood for praise the Lord so we noticed that the devil came and that he wanted to attack him and God let him be so he went and attacked him so he attacked his children he attacked his CLE he attacked his ship he attacked his flock he attacked even the church where job was Fellowship that even the people that were surrounding began to uh to doubt him and they thought maybe somehow could have been a silent sinner praise the Lord everyone else rejected him even his own wife asked him to reject God so you could die and get free from the pain that he was going through now job was a sincere man praise the Lord he was sincere to the cause he was sincere to God he was a Believer and not even [Music] tragedy not even the suffering not even all the battles around him get him out of the presence of God nothing kept him but the word which he had believed praise the Lord nothing kept job praise the Lord job had been locked in the word when he believed this word praise the Lord came in Union with the word praise the Lord and when he came in Union with the word he was convinced the word which he believed so now when he con was convinced he was faithful to the word and he kept the word the B says Jesus he told us that those that are faithful and keep his judgments and keep his Commandments and keep his words what did he say he said he and the father will come and make their AB in him when believed the words and he got a hold of the words praise the Lord the word became part of him and became part of the word so he could not be separated not even by the sickness that he was going through praise the Lord the Bible tells us in the Book of Romans I think it's verse 8 verse 31 there is nothing when a man or a woman has come into that countenance has come into that presence the presence of God and that man has stood sure of his calling praise the Lord and he has recognized who he is in the word and you become a part of the word which you have believed there is nothing that can attempt to come in between you and your God why because you have the Assurance praise the Lord something that convinces you that there is no other better place to be the word of God praise the Lord so not even sickness can stand in the way the word of God stood firm not even the sickness the cancer that was eating up his stand in his way with God praise the Lord he rejected everything else and he stood firm with the word praise the Lord so now regardless of the weaknesses praise the Lord he might have been weak here and there but he stood praise the Lord time he felt he was weak he got back to worship he got back to the word he got back to God what does that teacher praise the lord we shall become weak at some point and our strength failed praise the Lord but now we have the word we have the Assurance our strength is not drawn from anything else from the word of God so when we fail our strength fail Us Praise the Lord when do we have to run run back to the word of God praise the name of the living so now job always R back to the word praise the Lord such a man is a man who stood true and faithful to the word he had believed praise the Lord so many of them we have Abraham we have David Daniel we have we have Ruth Elijah all those are Gan soldiers talk about Paul a vibrant man praise the Lord who thought himself nothing without Jesus praise the Lord and he said for him to live has to be Jesus praise the Lord for you to live it has to be Jesus you cannot live without him he is our strength he is our courage praise the Lord so now when our faith fail us when our strength fail us let us run back to Jesus that's where we draw our strength praise the Living God join the Divine tested persed but stood true to the word which he had received not because he was so powerful not because they were so different from the rest of us but he was decided he had found a soless in the word found his position in the word and he was ready to give it all that required to preach Christ and to live for Christ when you find your position in the words you do whatever it takes to leave for the word praise the Lord you are not ashamed of the word regardless of how the environment has become but you stand true to the word praise the Lord you stand Faith the testimony you are carrying the testimony of Jesus Christ God wants such a man this generation that will and show themselves approved of the words to car the testimony that there is still a Christian that believes and lives by the word a living epe in this dying generation praise the Lord Satan is not seated Satan has always been on a hand in your Testament he was always on a hand that's why he came around moving around likeing lion and now when he saw job he wanted to get a hold of him he is not resting he still moving around we have one Assurance you have believed praise the lord we have been studying about the new birth if you have that confirmation and you have that Assurance of the new birth the life of God in you praise the Lord when you have that Assurance you have that seal praise the Lord even when the Devil comes around with wild doctr with all kinds of enticements with all kinds of attacks your soul has been locked together with the words by that seal because of that seal you have the Assurance of your Victory praise the Living God when the Devil comes he will come and he will Ro up but you are still locked in the hands of God and he's not giving up on us praise the lord the devil will come he will hit he will hit us in different ways as long as we have the Assurance of the word we have the assurance that our lives is not us anymore but Christ that lives in us so when the Devil comes to hit us up we still rise up knowing that we have he that lives in US is greater and more stronger than our weak failures so we have the assurance that anyhow shall make it to the end because the seal that we have the Bible says the seal that he gives us after he has drawn us to himself remember the Bible says faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God Jesus say no man comes unless the father draws the Lord so all alone we have God gues us through the he called us and now he positioned Us in the words he works upon us until we are ready for his service he gives us the new bir he gives us the Holy Spirit which is our seal as long as that seal is there as long as that token is there there is nothing that shall separate us from the love of God there is nothing that shall separate us from the words praise the Lord the Bible says not even sickness not even trials not Temptation not even suffering not things present things to come why because we have the assurance that we have the seal the life of God in our lives that seal has the power to protect us that seal has the power to guard you from the elments of evil praise the Lord and sometimes you get weak but when you get weak remember that the token is there when the devil hits you down you remember that the token is there you raise up and claim your position in the world praise the Living God he called us to himself because he called us to himself he gave us a seal which is our protection until the day of our Redemption not tomorrow not today but till the day of our Redemption so how do we stay true to the word how do we stay faithful to the word it is not your obligation it is his obligation to guide you in his word praise the Lord so what do we have to do we just have to surrender and be obedient to the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise the name of living God so now we have these men here talk about Moses praise the Lord when he was given a Great Commission a commission to lead the children of God from Egypt praise the Lord From A Land of Confusion from a land full of fil the land of suffering to the land of freedom but it was not an easy Road it was not an easy way found so many obstacles but remember God first worked upon Him Praise the Lord for the days the years worked upon him now he brings him to commission for the service of the Lord remember we've been dealing with that subject in the Sunday School when God calls us out he's not calling us to stay he's calling us for a service is calling you for a service praise the Lord he calls you and then he begins to work praise the Lord transform your life to align with his life praise the Lord so now he begins to cleanse you the process of sanctification and the prophet tells us that the blood of Jesus sanctifies us that God has given the blood praise the Lord for our sanctification so now during that process we simply have to accept the blood praise the Lord to take a hold of us to wash us cleanse us transform us until we are ready for service praise the name Living God and now when you ready for service now he gives us the reward of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord now God worked upon Moses to make sure that Moses was ready for service praise the Lord the service that he was going to do was not an easy service praise the Lord because God knows that Satan never sits when he calls you remember before he called you you are you are there in the world and you are comfortable there so Satan is sure that you are his until God draws you to himself that's when the battle begins praise the living go what tells us B does not belong to us The Battle Belongs to God praise the Living God so what do we have to do we surrender what we have to do surrender when the battles ra we raise up our hands surrender to him praise the Lord Moses he accepted the challenge he accepted the sacrifice he accepted to take up the position to go and lead the people praise the Lord so God worked upon him until he was a finished work praise the Lord so now when the devil tried to come around through his own people to him praise the Lord Moses was in the hand of God vessel God was using his purpose in his time praise the Lord and we are the vessel that God has brought out separ and put aside for service praise the Lord so service that we do we are not doing it unto men but we are doing it unto God praise the Lord that's what says stud Show Yourself approved praise the Lord study the word Show Yourself approved manifest your testimony the testimony of Jesus Christ because this is not your testimony the testimony of Jesus Christ so every little thing that we do let's show ourself approved of that testimony praise the living Moses his approved praise the lord of the testimony because when God met him burning bush spoke to him and he heard from God he was convinced that the thing that he was going to do was not his own but it was the work of God so regardless of the challenge and the battles he would first on the way the assurance that that work did not belong to him the work that we do does not belong to us it belongs to God praise the Lord it is about preaching it is not your ability it's not my ability speak the words the Lord it is the of God God choses gives us the message to take out with the people praise the Lord and when you're doing it you do it Faithfully knowing that what you're doing is not the work of man is the work of God doing the work of God is Not Just preaching every one of us God has called us service praise the Lord each one of us God has called us to do something for him praise the Lord it may be a something too small not even in the church but carrying the testimony to the rest of the world the lord the Bible says in the last days shall be a people that shall carry the message shall car the words not even not in words but their lives shall be a living episode prise the Lord is doing service to the Lord God is doing service the Lord go out to the world our neighborhoods places of work wherever we live Our Testimony is doing service unto the Lord because somehow someone shall read the letter they shall see Christ manifested in your life prise the Lord and they shall come to believe because of the life that you live that is doing service the Lord is staying true faithful to the word of God each everything that we do let's do it Faithfully knowing that we are doing it not unto ourselves butto God God takes such a manise the Lord why he is carrying the testimony of God he has gotten the token he is sealed praise the Lord and even when Satan comes around the man has the Assurance of the token praise the Lord so now that token the seal locks up locks us into the thoughts of God is the word of God expressed while in there nothing can separate us from the love of God which shines upon them that love him so what is nothing is whatever we've been exposed to God gives us the grace praise the Lord God gives us the grace why because God keeps his words if we are carrying his words is faithful to keep his words that's why he was faithful to keep his words job carried it he was faithful to keep his word Daniel carried praise the Lord he cannot leave his word be destroyed why Heaven and Earth shall pass away but his word never pass away and as long as we are carrying the word of God we are carrying the Eternal so Heaven and Earth shall pass away as long as the word of God stays in our life our hearts our soul we shall never perish we shall have eternal life because we have he that is eternal we have that seal praise the Living God now when you locked in there you have the mind of God you express the mind of God the testimony of God you bear the character of God you are patient with God when you are facing a trial you know that God is faithful and we cannot leave a trial that is beyond that which we can overcome to come our way so when you pray and you take it to him you become patient praise the Lord you have the character of God you have the life of God praise the living nothing can separate you from the word of God why you got the seal and you're locked in nothing can get you out of his holy presence praise than living God Moses kept himself there and while the people were stuggling praise the Lord he kept believing why because he was carrying the message the light of his death and he was the witness to the light because he heard the voice of God when he spoke out of the burning we have heard the voice of God through the spoken words we have heard this testimony so we are sure the message that we have believed praise the Living God when Calamity hit them when Calamity H themes said in the book of Deuteronomy 31:6 says Don't Worry Be Strong out of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of for the Lord thy God he it is that do go with you he will not fail you for you praise the Lord when you locked in there and you have the assurance that the Lord Our God it is that goes before us will not fail us forsake us failure yes we may fail he does not forsake us in our conditions he can't fail his bright so you raise up and run back to him and present yourself before him he takes care of the rest praise the Lord sickness yes it shall strike us but none of these things can take away the seal with which we were sealed praise the Lord Faithful is he called us he is very faithful and he shall lead us through the Journey so what should we have to do obedient to the word Jeremiah 39:1 17 397 but I will deliver thee in that day says the Lord and thou shall not be given unto the hand of men of whom thou at aright he will deliver us he has delivered he has delivered Moses he has delivered Daniel he has delivered ES praise the Lord he has delivered the three children he has delivered John theine he has delivered all those G soldiers delivered St sold when he set out to preach he had had the message of his he had the Assurance message and not even death could separate him the word which he had received so when they met him he was speaking with the lot of strength praise the Lord they attempted to kill him he was not afraid of death until they dragged him out of the city sted him he never denounced the words nothing shall separate us from the word of God nothing shall separate us from the love God has toward Us Praise the Lord and the prophet says here in the message the present stage of my ministry2 now here is the thing I want kind of exercise on a few moments usually it is usually at such a time as this when men has stayed true to the word and all men have forsaken him until God step Sin in defense of that person and crowns his ministry remember what happened the day of Daniel the people wanted to kill him they consed against him for nothing else but because of his face praise the Lord he used to kneel down and pray in the morning and worship in the afternoon and worship in the evening and the people looked at him to persecute him why because his faith obain him favor before the king and now they consp to kill but now Daniel when they came to ask denounce his faith and stop praying he never did it praise the Lord he never obeyed those principles obey the policy praise the Lord why because there is no policy that is stronger the word of God the government pass policies governments can pass laws yes we must obey the law if the law stands in the way of your faith the way of the words that law is not above the law of God tells us to keep The Words which we have received to love the Lord Our God with all our hearts all our minds the law was said in the way of Daniel and the word which we had which had believed he disobeyed that law praise the Lord and the penalty was to throw him in the but even when it was to be thrown the the fear of death could not separate him from the word which had received praise the Lord talk about MRA and Abed when they broke the law that was against their worship Lord the fire that was set before them the fear of death could not stand in the way between them and their gods is nothing that should stand between our Lords praise the Lord between you and your God praise the Living God says not sickness not sorrow even death not hunger can separate us we are anchored in the word as long as we are anchored in the word nobody shall School you prise the Lord how should true to the word God himself which is the Life of Christ of your heart talk about Jo the Divine the Lord stood for the testimony of Jesus Christ great pers boiled but even when he was in there he never denounced the word which he had believed true faithful as Believers of the day as Believers that have received the evening light let us surrender ourselves praise the Lord and allow God to give us the strength and courage to stand true to the word praise the Lord Daniel answered and said before the king that that Daniel which is of the children of captivity of Judah not thee Oh King no the decree that thou Hast signed but maketh his petition three times a day it was not about the king it's not about the people that preside over us it is not about the policy it is about the word of God praise the Lord he says I make my petition Thrice a day if anything comes between us and thece Jesus Christ praise the lord it's not about that thing it is a policy it's not about that policy but it's about God praise the Lord and God only that is the theme of our song Praise the Lord says I don't regard your decree neither you King darus I'll continue making my petition he stood with boldness praise the Lord when strict policies set saw that they infringed on his personal life with the word stood firm with the words was not challenged stood firm with what is that praise the Lord it says nothing shall stand between we think of any challenge that could come between us and God we the promise we got the message we got the token and that is the absolute stay in line with the word stay in fellowship with the stay in worship nothing completely nothing should come in between us our God nothing between my soul and my savior nothing between my soul and the Savior so that his blessed face may be seen nothing preventing the list of his favor keep the way clear nothing this be known to you I will not obey your word because your word stands between me and my God I am told and I am convinced that as long as there is something that comes between me and my gods I will not give hit I will stay right with the words praise the Lord and he says oh my Restless your commitment with God your alance with Christ will cause confusion and unrest your enemies sat comes Restless time he is to be exposed in the same man in Daniel 3 nebz was Restless until they were out for he know that God was with them the Hebrew children stay true to the word under the king's Proclamation whoever shall not B to the image will be thrown into the fiery and they turned their back to the image regardless of how unpopular they became regardless of how excommunicated they would be from the society stayed true to the word that's right keeping true to the word the promises of God Daniel took a stand for the word what happened to him when he was the right hand man to the king he took a true stand for the word and was excommunicated and thrown into the LI a man of God standing true to the words praise the Living God and now let me read this here he says Jesus true to the father's word praise the lord we find that Jesus was true to the father's words he never gave up he says I do only that which the father says because it is written The man shall not live by bread alone that's when Satan came to attack him but he stood true to the word he never gave up praise the Lord that word praise the name of the Living God and now what do we have to do friends in the last days we have the word we have received the message let us stand turn true to the word which we have received when the Devil comes like he did in them days of job Daniel M and the rest of them he hit them down and he thought that he had overcome he thought he was Victorious but he that lived in those men was stronger than the devil that was beating them down and when the time was come he rose up and he stood for his testimony why because they never denounce the word of God they remain true to the teson praise the name of the Living God and he says so they so quickly forget what God did was talking about the children of Israel how Moses said that the Red Sea when he stood there and said God has done 10 outstanding Miracles are you still so deliquent that you don't know that he is still God when challenges come praise the Lord challenges came before the of isra and they forgot the Miracles they forgot the hand of God which he had done we have to be faithful and remember that he that call us out that he that has led us to his word is still faithful to his word praise the Lord regardless of the fighting and everything around us God is still faithful to his words praise the Lord so when we falter when we fall sick when we fail remember God is faithful to his words he that started a good work in US is faithful and ready to take it to ACC comption he's not giving up on us until we accomplished vessel he's not giving up on us until he sees us up yonder he's not giving up on you until you've overcome the world and you've won your white drop until you overcome the world and you're ruling together with him God is faithful to his word we don't have to give up we don't have to be dismayed but when we first Calamity need to switch into the moment of worship because worship worshiping and praising God what did he say praise the Lord they said but job the same God that your profess to be faithful too he has allowed Satan to kill your children to kill your flock he's even taking away your body praise the Lord but what did job say he says it is God that give and it is God that takes away blessed be the name of the Lord job remained faithful and what did he do God was faithful to him praise the Lord and God came to him and he said job here I am and began questioning him then he said because of your faithfulness look up here and when job looked up there he saw another job praise the Lord he saw another job in glorified body in a body that is renewed and the body did not have any worms he saw himself up there and what did he say the Bible says job shouted and say I know my redeemer leaveth St true to the word be faithful he gives us a reward and when he comes on the scene he will be able to sing a song that you know your Redeemer liveth praise the Lord I was watching a preacher preach and there was a clip that I was watching and there was a gentleman who was preaching and while he was preaching people came and mocked him and they took away the microphone that was using to preach praise the Lord and now he be began shivering and he was ight and they asked him to denounce the god which he was preaching and while he was still there in a moment of confusion there was another preacher that came and the preacher stood and he questioned them and says why do you mock that created the heavens and earth and they told him show us proof that your God exists and says I am the living proof that the God that I worship exists you don't have any other proof to show the world but your life alone is a living proof that the god that you worship exist praise the Lord and now we had a challenge recently my wife at the workplace she has never had any sort of warning any sort of warning caution from from her bosses and now they brought a new regional manager and the regional manager made sure he changes people in all the branches around e so he made sure that every manager in every branch is either chest or is forced to reside so now there there was a case at her branch and she was at leave so now they called her to ask her about it she was green we were at home and now I told her you tell them you away because you don't know anything taking place so they waited for her to come so that regional manager had her his people that he wanted to put in every Branch so now he came with a spir he came with a spirior with with the MD man director from the head office to the branch then he began causing many accusations upon my wife so because she was was kind of terrified she could not defend herself then the following day she could not come to church because she found a lot of work on her desk so she went and opened on Sunday so she missed that day the day we had the Lord supper so now she was there working and doing some works and now at around 5 she's coming home then the regional manager heard that that the people were working on Sunday it is normal they keep working each time there is a lot of work but now he took so he took a screenshot of the call she did not receive the call and I chose her of so many things and wrote a letter and called it the last warning Le she was bound to lose her job so she wrote a reply I she called me on a Monday morning I dropped her workpl she didn't tell me anything she just gave me that warning letter and I told her one thing you are a child of God you know your position in the words I want you to do one thing you go and speak to God and tell him him what you want and sure believe that God will honor your word God will do whatever you tell him I I left I called after 30 minutes have you told God your problem she was still confused she says I am I'm I'm going I said go and tell God close your office go and close yourself somewhere and tell God even if there are two or three words and now before she told God she got a call from her colleague was calling this man is here heusing me again she saw a message on email the manager of L had resigned because of the same man then I she called me and said there is a lot of mess going on I asked what do you want to she said the other people were are praying they want this man maybe God do something I asked her what do you want God to do for you said this man has punished people in this region I pray that God lets this man to leave I told her that's what you have asked God now go and tell God I'm also going to tell God we believe that man will live even if he very hard working but six managers have lost their jobs in the space of three months I said then you are going to be if you are to leave you'll be the last person but as long as you're there before other person leaves he is going to leave we told God and I never asked anything about it after two days I I'd like to come back home so I was in the field so she calls me excited the manager the reg manager had posted and he was posting if he has been sucked she was not very sure then she went to their group the H had had advertised [Music] the position of that regional manager and the adver was like they looking for a regional manager Eastern region froma up to and yet it is this man and then the following day she they all received the notice that the regional manager had been sucked that was the hand of God
