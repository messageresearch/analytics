father in the challenges that we come forth in our amilies and give us Grace Lord Jesus to ever be making the right decision that we may always live together as a family that the Lord has put together we love you and we bless you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus this amen let us go to Genesis CH 25 reading from verse 19 to verse 23 Genesis 25 reading from verse 19 to verse 23 the Bible says and these are the generations of Isaac Abraham's son Abraham begot Isaac Genesis 25 verse 19 and ISAC was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to his wife the daughter of Beth the Syrian of parad the sister toan the Syrian and Isaac Entre the Lord for his his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived is and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two Nations and thy wom and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and one shall be stronger than the other and the Elder Shall Serve the younger may God bless his word may seated so I want to preach on the subject being an example family praise the name of the Lord so when you read in the scriptures praise the name of the Lord you always find that all the fames through the scriptures they had challenges praise the name of the Lord the first family of Adam and Eve they had challenges they had problems in their family like now the first thing talk to the serpent and then the serpent deceived Eve Eve followed what the serpent was telling now what was the reaction of Adam and you see every one of Us in all our families pressures will arise troubles will come problems will come challenges will come and you know as long as we are living in this life uncertainty will not stop coming you know because we're living in these bodies and as long as we are living in these bodies anything can happen at any time and maybe you know you even don't know sometimes where it's going to come from but then our responsibilities as a family is to see how you handle those challenges that come in your home like now you look at Adam when Eve adultery what did Adam do he forgave her he received her to himself praise the name of our Lord we see the same thing with actually Joseph when Joseph Was preparing to marry Mary you know Joseph found Mary with a child but now the Bible says Joseph never wanted to make it a public example because what would have done what they were doing at that time is you know you take her to the people or to the elders and say this woman but not been with her but she's pregnant and then she would have been Stone to death but then the Bible says Joseph being a just person he nevered anything evil to happened to Mary so then he had decided to put her away secretly he never wanted anything evil to happen to Mary that's why the Bible says he was a just man he was a rightous and he should be the same thing also to us in our families praise the name of our Lord is that if the other party has done something you know you need to bear with that person you need to exercise forgiveness praise the name of our Lord and also we who are message Believers we know better than what the people in the world do because here you know it is the love of God that has saved us it's the love of God that has kept us at this time so you need to exercise that same love of God in your family praise the name of our Lord as we've said every family from Adam there has always been challenges and sometimes things maybe you don't understand and now if you don't understand an issue in your family then you go to God In Prayer like we've read here in in Genesis 25 the Bible says when Isaac married got Rebecca as his wife he was 40 years of age but it took him 20 years for Rebecca to give birth socca was baren now Isaac never exchanged for somebody else he had to wait praise the name of our maybe he kept on praying the first year he prayed nothing happened he prayed nothing happened third he prayed nothing happened until now the 19th year in their marriage God heard their prayer the same thing with Elizabeth and Zaria Zaria was an old man Elizabeth was an old woman and then Zakaria would go to the temple and then he burns incense and then the people were waiting from outside also praying that their prayers would go with the incense and they kept on maybe God was answering their prayers but now Zakaria here from a young man to an old man praying for a child nothing was coming but Zaria didn't get another wife because Elizabeth was baren they kept on waiting on the Lord they were patient praise the name of our Lord they were able to bear with one another and you see this is what also we need to learn to learn how to bear with one another praise the name of our Lord learn to bear with your husband learn to bear with your wife and certainly each has got their weaknesses but in the midst of their weaknesses that's why you are part of them praise the name of our Lord and that's why you need to know that you compliment one another you need to give the other support you need to be a companion to your wife a companion to your husband praise the name of our Lord that's why God permitted for you to live together praise the name of our Lord so then don't Seek about separation don't Seek about how you can live contrary to one another but you see how you can live in harmony husband and a wife you know creating a environment for your children to grow up in the fear of the Lord creating a conducive environment for your children to desire to be like you praise the name of our Lord you know there are people who have grown up with bad examples when they look at their families they say I don't want to say that is torture say why entering that thing when you're still young because they have been shown bad examples but you see family is good to start when you still strong praise the name of Lord why would you want to reach a middlee person then you start a family not the best especially if God has given you the ability it's always good to marry when you are still young praise the name of our Lord for the Sisters there is a age you can reach that you may not be able to conceive so you find out that's out then for brothers there is a time you reach that you everybody look you know because you keep on growing so it's always good start your family when you are still young that you can raise your children when you are still strong and when you are still you know even places of work when you reach 60 they say we retire you now assume you are 60 years and your children is 5 years 10 years not because of Misfortune because one was now it's you saying I think now I've made enough money I can marry you know it's not really the best so then we need to see that that you know you learn have family when you are young enough and you devote time for your family to raise your children you reach maybe that age 60 you you can now be able to see of your children and then maybe see them mared say that they can get be able to relate with you praise the name of our Lord have that praise the name of our Lord you know there is a scripture maybe we go there first Corinthians chapter 7 praise the name of the Lord First Corinthians chapter 7 and then verse one he says now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me it's good for a man not to touch a woman now you the Bible says did a ien that it is not good for a man to touch a woman misin it praise the name of our Lord what what is he talking about say it's good for a man not to touch a woman which manse says nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and every woman have her own husband so which man is it talking about the one who is not married praise the name of the Lord so if you're not married it's good for you not to touch a woman but now if you are married you have one praise the name of our Lord and then now you see that in this verse here is a promise that every man can have his own wife and every woman can have her own husband so now if I want a wife I take that scripture to God lord you said I need to have my own wife if I want a husband I Take God that scripture Lord you said I didn't have my own husband not one we are going to share with others so you see the scripture is telling us you know everyone a husband a man can get a wife and a woman can have a husband praise the name of our Lord now you know the devil is so terrible when you are not married you desire one another so much now when you come together husband and wife then the devil brings things out you start seeing hatred [Music] despising listing somebody's mistakes there's a brother had a black book on his wife and so he had that black book he would write down the date what the wife has done and he he was putting every mistake of the wife how you can imagine such a home the husband writing a black book against his wife now maybe you may not have that black but in your mind you keep on reminding her did this the other year again you have done this again you have done this we need to bring forgiveness there we need to bring in forgiveness there praise the name of our Lord you know that's one of the things which brought divorce in the Old Testament because he said if you have an issue against your wife you write her a letter of divorce and give her to go and then another can Mar and then they came and asked Jesus why did Moses tell them let us go to MTH chapter 19 praise the name of the Lord MTH chapter 19 and then verse three the FES also came to him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause he answered and said unto them have you not Tre that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall C to his wife and they shall be one flesh wherefore they are noral TR but one flesh what for God has joined together let no man put a so he was pointing them to the first Covenant one man one woman and said he made them one but now these people were now referring to where it can be one plus many then they said to him in verse S why Moses command to give a writing of divorcement to put her away he says unto themes because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so so now Christ addresses the issue of the hardness of our hearts and this is one of the areas in our marriage where Satan can exploit when you have a Hardy heart towards your wife when you have a hard heart toward your husband you can never enjoy your marriage you know the hardness of heart will make you judgmental FL every small thing you are not appreciating and you see the devil puts upon you that you easily see the mistakes and you don't see the good that's what the devil does and so you find that your marriage is hard every day you live in it they so hard remove the hardness of heart praise the name of our Lord and I personally believe there is no better wife than what God has given you there is no better husband than what God has given you so don't start thinking about somebody else no see how best you can make that work out the husband you have or the wife you have see how best you can live in harmony how you can live in happiness not allow the pring to you like this it wasn't for you praise the name of our Lord so you just appreciate what God has given you and be thankful and said Lord I Thank you for my wife Lord thank you for my husand and then you pray for one another praise the name of our Lord you just pray for one another you know yesterday I was in and then there's a brother is a parish is a parish in one of those sub counties in par district and then now he was giving a testimony of the challenges at a place of work telling us that they call him was wondering they started calling me and I was like he wondered then he said okay he had some problem about being mad but of course he recovered he recovered but now the the place of work they know him as the name they call him then he was saying that he was he was getting annoyed with everybody who was calling him that but finally he accepted that they call him it was very strange he accepted praise the name of the Lord but now you see you are in a sitation [Music] he's your wife she's your wife he's your husband praise the name of the Lord don't be ashamed about who they are you know even becoming your wife or your husband they didn't blindfold you first you made the choice praise the name of so just Rejoice with what God has given you and bear with bear with him the things may not be the best but they can do better and you see how you can live together in support of one another so you remove the hardness of heart you know he doesn't like this she doesn't like this then why would you want to repeat it all the time praise the name of our Lord you want to repeat the same issue isue or your family your people or this or this and now there are some tribes when the wife doesn't give birth she's feeling our some of those families like that now as a husband why do you keep your wife where she's abused you know you take her where you know she's secure you must be the protection for your wife you must be the protection for your husband praise the name of the Lord you see there are also some people when they marry they take their wies to The Villages and then for him he stays in town why did you marry her go and make plantations for you or you know very strange but somebody thinking is like that in the town I can't live with the wife let me take her to the Village she didn't marry you to be away from you praise the name of our Lord she's meant to live with you praise the name of the Lord she's meant to be with you unless maybe it is your conent but even that there are challenges the husband is in Guru the wife is Ina they meet maybe once in a week or once in a month there will always be more challenges more Tres than susp [Music] you making a lot of money you're not giving me support you don't care about me it has its own problems so now we need to see that we live in harmony praise the name of the Lord so Isaac when he saw the wife is not giving back he waited on the Lord praise the name of the Lord and then another thing you should make sure the devil doesn't put in your mind is to think you've got the wrong person don't allow the devil to put that in your mind accept this is my wife accept this is my husband regardless of their weaknesses regardless of their limitations for them and then you'll see how God will take you through the challenges that you face otherwise the devil will use those gaps you are seeing you know to create a distance between you until you know you start ausing one another you start thinking bad about the other the Devil is a master of that he knows how to paint you start imagining about your wife or your husband that they doing this you believe it then you build a complex toward the same so when he's talking to you about this you are responding to what you thinking have I had right okay let me keep quiet and now when he keeps you start thinking and then you get convinced the other day said that he kept quiet so it is true and then you start building your imaginations and if you thinking so much about it you even get a dream and you want to run your home based on dreams you dream and there are some places where Satan can anoint neighbors or other people to bring false information even the other one told me you shouldn't do like that praise the name of our Lord why would you believe another person more than your own husband or your own praise the name of our Lord why would you do that you shouldn't do that praise the name of our Lord and then now for my brothers and sisters who have not yet got into marriage praise the name of our Lord don't allow the devil to get yourself messed up praise the name of the Lord let me say it this way don't sleep with one another when not that you do before marriage is a good point for Satan to use in future you see be patient so he's doing it to somebody else and the devil uses that several times and sometimes you find people's challenges they come from that point not trusting one another not believing one another when one sees the husband talking with a woman he suspects I think he wants do the way he did to me when the other one sees the wife talking to another man he just imagin that but you see if you're working in a society you mean at place of work you should avoid talking to your female colleagues because you have a wife how can that happen you live in a community Society praise the name of the Lord but you see the devil has got a ground somewhere and then he puts that imagination not to trust the other you're not comfortable you're not trusting one another so see that you don't give certain opportunity to bring such imagination in future but see that you live upright waiting on the Lord praise the name of our Lord and see that you see that you avoid question things a husband or wife you know like I start talking with a sister a woman I'm very free with her but I'm not free with my wife then there's something wrong then you start wondering why is this smiling so much but doesn't smile with meise the name of you know it's just like this introductions you know when they are doing these introductions in many places when the women come especially the visitors maybe actually it's the guest who come and the V it's is the host who come and greet they say let us bring our daughters and they greet you and then now what they do let us also bring these ones to come now there was a scenario the visitors the women have come and actually it was the the men of the home the boys Men actually and many of them were married they come to greet the visitors and then this said and then the women come and they come with belts and then they come and put around your waist then they touch here then they start dancing around around around but you've never danced with your wife but you're dancing with a stranger you know and then until there was one the wife said you know those women can take your husband and she was really meaning so you need to avoid those kind of things you've never been able to walk with your wife in public but you busy with another person something wrong praise the name of our Lord even us when we are making functions in our home let us avoid those kind of things especially where you have authority why would they need opposite sex to come and meet in the front of the if it is really culture what kind of culture is that praise the name of our Lord so you need to avoid questionable things you know somebody is not trusting you and then there are others the TR comes from phones phones so one would rush very fast if the husband is in the bathroom or the wife is in the bathroom try to go who's calling what is on it here you know there are so many funny things until if they get it immediately they get whatever CH they suspect [Music] either take a shot of it very F by the time you come out of the bathroom they already got the information they want you know even this man is cheating on me is cheating on me suspicion but the devil uses all those fronts you don't have peace at home that you don't have peace at home but you don't be like that we need to have trust for one another we need to have kindness one another praise the name of our Lord you know there was one said but why did this one come when I'm not there and then brought a complex but shouldn't be like that let us learn how to handle the challenges that we have at home and be open I don't know why I'm thinking like this oh am suspecting this and you be frank with one another and then you talk it over praise the name of our Lord and then you don't continue with that same thought propagating it propagating it yesterday I ask him for money he told me doesn't have but then now today I that somebody doesn't have and sent that person suspicion and all those things bring trouble at home that you know you cannot have peace at home but this should not be our families praise the name of our Lord we have Better Homes than read those kind of things now in the message he cares for you he says God gave man a wife to comfort him to touch him and any man knows that's a good that's a good wife that's got a good wife that there's something about a good wife then he said if a man be upset in his business or his walks of life and can come home no matter there is one he says there is one you know in other words you can get Comfort praise the name of the Lord and he should be the same thing with us as a wife be a for be a comfort to your husband give him comfort you know when he comes home you don't start asking questions of Suspicion where are you coming from why didn't you send me money why didn't you do this praise the name of our Lord but learn how to do it love but then you he doesn't come and then you start asking him questions maybe at place of work is hot and then now for you are putting in more fire yet you are meant to understand him better than the colleagues the comfort you know understanding praise the name of the Lord so he says when a man has such troubles and he comes home the wife gives him comfort he says it's the way it's that way with me when I come from overseas somewhere and I am so nervous and upset and lot of sleep and hear the cry see the little hungry children on the street crying and going forth just kills me then when I come home if wife still sat down on the arm of the chair put her arm around me and say oh I understand you know praise the name of our Lord yeah we need to do these things give him Comfort make him feel welcome at home prise the name of home should not be a prison praise the name of brother was preaching on wedding inala and then he said you can see from outside very beautiful buildings but the person who lives there because when he enters there prison those should not be our homes Let There Be Joy Let There Be comfort then he says and just a few little parts from the wife means so much same thing a husband to a wife that's the way God want it to be praise the name of our Lord a companion a help me praise the name of the Lord help me praise the name of our Lord that's we need to look to one another this is my help the best help me for me this is my compion the best companion I could ever get and don't allow the devil to say why do you doubt I don't know what I praise the name of the Lord appreciate your husband appreciate your wife then you'll see how the Lord will bring the little things you see are the only good things and you seeing the rest are bad he will bring the little you which is good and they will magnify it praise the name of the Lord and the Bible says love covers a m of sin praise the name of love will put all the negatives aside will put all the failures aside and you see such a happy family praise the name of our you'll see such a home so happy and you know sometimes when you go through situations we think that our situation is worse than the other but there are people who are passing through a hard ministration very hard that you start saying God give Grace to that person there is an issue we trying to see how God can help right there in this brother is a whole head teacher now when he believed the message the wife the family is Seventh Day Adventist now the wife separated sups you are po e not cooking for you took the children to turn against the father head Master they live in his home she said I no longer am interested in you but he has to pay fees he has to take care of the family and then now what she did she left him and then she said you watch that man if you will not get another wife you can imagine how he was pushed to the push him even turn the children against because he has left their religion very challenging situation and we just encouraged him show your responsibility see that they have food see that the children are going to school and do the best you can praise the name of I don't believe there's any of us in that kind of I don't believe there's somebody any of us in that kind of station but there are people who live in that situation but they have to bear with you are heading a school and then they laughing at you head Master but you your that kind of so we need to see that we appreciate what God has given to us and not have the hardness of heart let that love for one another the desire for one another praise the name of the Lord say my time is running out let us go to First Peter chapter First Peter chapter 3 and then we start from verse 6 says even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with amazement so the Bible says wives should obey their husbands and wives husbands should love their wives then verse seven likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor to the wife as unto the weaker Vel and as being he together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered praise the name of our Lord that your prayers be not hindered so he says dwell with them in other words Let There Be Love Let There Be compassion let there be you know being patient with one another be considerate of one another as a husband and as a wife praise the name of our Lord as a husband and wife you know it shouldn't be like enemies living in the same and then you are in a marriage for convenience [Music] no you are there for the husband praise the name but you know you see some families they because of the children but the children will go away and you know it is very funny there is a way mothers can win the children to their side now when the children have grown under well of they can take your wife from you just take her away you the father is going to die when he's alone just Beau for a good house somewhere there and then the father is in the house is collapsing as if he never produced used to TCH Mama there are some families like that and maybe when the children come to visit they give a special package to Mommy Mommy can change clothes but Dad has old shoes and you know at that time you're no longer working and maybe if you have not been in government you have no Pion now what can take care of you the children have abandoned you they on their mother there are some of some families like that then you start wondering what's wrong with the CH but you see we need to have that compassion for one another being considerate and then the Bible says in finally be all of One [Music] mind you know one mind you think alike you have similar desires you have similar passion same direction praise the name of our Lord and then you can Edge together in happiness praise the name of our Lord and then you can have such a family that can encourage everybody you can have such an example family to your children praise the name of our Lord then he said having compassion one of another compassion why would you need compassion if you don't have any weakness because one or another you may make a mistake because we are still humans so now when one makes a mistake you don't use that person's mistake to crucify him no that's where you are needed to show kindness to show support and give that person encouragement then he says love as Brethren so you see that much as we may be husband and wife but we are Brethren at the same time praise the name of the Lord we are joint haers with Christ so as a husband you are a son of God as a wife you are a daughter of God so if you married the daughter of God tell me how will God think about if you mistreat her praise the name of like if you go and marry from the first family and then he you mistreating his daughter or you mistreating his son I don't think is something pleasing now how about God you married God's daughter you have God's son why would you miss God's child praise the name of our Lord
