immortality [Music] now I shall be changed [Music] I shall be Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] like this [Music] I shall be changed person now praise the name of our Lord and then you say change from this motor you touch your body because it's a motor body praise the name of our Lord you know these bodies are not our inheritance we have a better inheritance waiting for us I shall be changed from this motto to any motor body that's waiting for me then after singing like that you tell you you shake hands of your neighbor say you shall be changed from your motto prematurity praise the name of

confession we are confessing that each of us will be changed we are so thankful father that we are not confessing it in vain but Lord you've shown us that people have been changed before our lord Jesus was changed and we have a promised Lord that is waiting foreign [Music] foreign we go to First Corinthians soccer First Corinthians chapter 15 soccer yes we are reading from verse 51 up to verse 57. the scripture says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed at the last for the trumpet shall sound and the day shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed foreign must put on the an incorruption and this motto must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this motto shall over put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that's written death is swallowed up in Victory or death where is thy sting or grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is seen and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which gives us Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ foreign HB um so my subject is we shall be changed and the scripture emphasizes it several times Universe 51. we shall all be changed he says we shall be changed praise the name of Allah how many of us believe we are going to be changed that should be your confession praise the name of our Lord that I shall be changed praise the name of our Lord it doesn't matter what you are going through but that should be your confession I shall be changed from this motto to an immortal body because that's the promise of Allah that's the promise of our Lord if our hearts have received The Incorruptible word praise the name of Allah then that very incorruptive word if it grows in our hearts it will also make us incorruptive that's how it begins life is you receiving the word The Incorruptible literally every one of us now when the heaven is passing away and the Earth is passing away where will you be all of us want to be in heaven and they desire to be in heaven now when the heaven is passing away and the Earth is passing away where are you going to be now that puzzles people again Heaven is going to pass away then somebody says no it is not going to pass away I've been in heaven but the Bible says going to pass away so where are you going to be when the heaven is passing away wow you think about it where are you going to be when the heaven is passing away but you see the scripture answers that question he says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away so where will you be because it is the word of God that created the heavens and the Earth and now the same word of God that created the heavens and the Earth is the same word of God that God gives us and he says be born again by The Incorruptible word of God so when you receive the word you are receiving something you are receiving something which is greater than the heaven something which is greater than the earth praise the name of Allah so when the heaven is passing away when the earth is passing away we shall be in the word of God and we don't wait for that time to be in the word of God but right now we are in the word of God praise him in the name of our Lord so if we the word of God then we shall be changed from this motor body immortality foreign man that is born of a woman is over a few days and full of trouble he comes forth like a flower and is cut down he flees also as a shadow and continues not foreign it doesn't matter whatever thing you may try to do of course it is good to be careful it's good to be healthy it's good to take questions but it doesn't matter how much you may take questions yeah when I get to my children I'll take them to medical school but unfortunately you find that when they have just finished the medical school death just strikes anytime and you know call fights for this Village this just comes anywhere it comes everywhere you know you may say I know oh but me if I have a lot of money I will not die but death can strike anytime so the Bible is telling us man that is born of a woman is of a few days and those few days travel every time you wake up in the morning [Music] it can mean any kind of forms your business about business or any kind of thing can happen now booty so we see that the bodies that we get from our parents we get them as a result of sin today praise the name of our Lord because the Bible says that the wages of sin is this the wages of sin is this now because there was sin because there was sins [Music] Romans chapter 6 verse 23. for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord praise the name of Allah so he says the wages of sin so the Bible goes ahead and tells us in Romans chapter five and then verse 12. the scripture says wherefore by one man sin entered into the world and the death by sin so death passed upon all men for all have sinned foreign [Music] was passed upon all men for all have seen now that is our first bus our birth from our parents qualifies us to be motto beings our back from our parents qualifies us to be corruptive beings our bathroom our parents qualifies us to live for a short time the second Adam our Lord Jesus Christ that changes the situation praise the name of Allah because by man came this is First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 21. for since my Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 21. to for us in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive so the first Adam from which we be we are begotten by our parents so until we are now born by the Lord Jesus Christ that's when we can say we cannot die that's when we can say we shall be king not of our own ability but the Lord Jesus Christ himself who lives in US changes us takes us New Creation when he makes us New Creations then we cannot die in sin anymore even when the body dies the Bible calls it you are sleeping and when you sleep you awake is the name of Allah when you sleep are you troubled when you're going to sleep when you're going to wake up you know but you have to wake up anyhow I don't know and wake up so the Saints in the Lord the Saints who are in the Lord the Bible tells us in first Thessalonians chapter 4 Bible yet and then verse 13. but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you saw or not even as others which have no hope sorry so verse 14 he says yes chapter 4 verse 13 verse 13. together [Music] Uganda is the Bible says who are asleep so some of them have slept for two thousand years but they will awake they have slain for two thousand years they slept for about four thousand years and then verse 51 and behold the veil of the temples reigned in time from the top to the bottom and the Earth did quick and the Rocks rent Ed foreign [Music] and came out of the grapes after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many Montana [Music] is the name of Allah the Bible says many sins from Genesis you can count them one by one no one needs children no one have another you can you know write yourself and then you get to the days of you know Moses [Music] and then you get down all those people and then they are those who around that okay so the Bible has told us a rose so in English the scripture is telling us we should not them assembly [Music] just sleeping they're just waiting for a time to hear the voice and then they will arise and they will appear to us and we shall see them praise the name of us first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 14. for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again what we designed yes we have foreign so when you sleep in Jesus have you been born again have you been born of the word of God have you been born of The Incorruptible word of God because it is by The Incorruptible word of God that you will arise that you will come out of the grace it's by The Incorruptible word of God that we shall be changed your name and the word of God has been given to us first Peter Peter and then chapter one praise the name of our Lord First Peter chapter one soccer and then verse 23 to verse 25. being born again not of the corruptible seed but of The Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever [Music] um foreign for All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass with us and the flower they are all fedeth away um but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you now praise the name of our Lord by The Incorruptible word of God now if we are we are born a gained by the word of God then we also leave forever because the word and ends forever the Bible says who shall go across the seas to bring him down oh shall go down in here but the Bible says the word is near you how far is your mouth from you how far is your heart from me now why does it talk about the heart why does he talk about them that when you hear the words you should believe it with your heart and when you believe it with your heart press it with your mouth and that's how you become part of the world you hear the word Lord I receive D this one Lord will be quickened by the holy spirit so then the Holy Spirit comes down in your heart praise the name of Allah baptism of the holy spirit is not complicated the spirit will come down and you get many Believers in that room of our brother I don't either have the Holy Ghost oh brother ah that church doesn't have the Holy Ghost oh brother foreign do you think getting the holy spirit is easy don't take it praise is and then one of the persons there was saying in the church and then it was encouraging people to be foolish virgins oh you know if there are Japanese and your left mirror you need to be prepared this message is not sent for the foolish virginity this message is sent for the election this message is sent to prepare the Bride of Jesus Christ now in our church how about you I tell you where foreign [Laughter] receive your wife the word is imparting the spiritual nature of Christ upon your life praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says and then verse 46 then walked bold and said it was necessary that the word of God spoken unto you but seeing you put it away from you and judge yourselves and wonder of everlasting life law we turn to the Gentiles Paulo nebula nebulbas never foreign but you are rejecting it you are throwing it away you are refusing the word so what you are doing you are judging yourselves that you don't want eternal life you are Unworthy of eternal life like when the master sent invitations I'm saying big minute to come to my wedding and then they went to the people who are busy please come to the wedding they want the people who are walking on the street foreign indeed like we we kind of don't do evangelism around it and the first week many people hundreds of them were promising to come and then waiting on Sunday I don't know how many hours calling on foreign foreign so people judge the judge themselves not worthy but the invitation is given um [Music] and this is what the Jews were judging themselves not worthy of eternal life and then in verse says for so as the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that those should be for salvation and to the ends of the Earth [Music] and when the Gentiles had this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as men as we are ordained to eternal life believed that is when they told the Gentiles the gospel is foreign and then the Bible says blessed verse 1 blessed is the demand that works not in the cancer of the ungodly nor a standeth in the way of Sinners nor are sitteth in the seat of this cornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his Lord does he meditate day and night and he shall be like a trip planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forces fruit in this season his life also shall not wither or whatever he does he shall prosper foreign foreign foreign what you desire we will change your work you're not going to walk in the advice of people who are not right we will change your stance you're going you want to go and stand in the way of Sinners will change your city you know changes your heart's desires changes your speech changes your actions and that's how the word keeps on working upon us and then the Bible says the word is the seeds like now it's a planting season so when you plant the seed there the maturity may not be in one day but it has stages of growth and that is also the same thing with the word of God when you receive the word of God cherish it change it even if you still have weaknesses have weaknesses in your spirit transforms [Music] how will your mind bad thing foreign yourself our daily life [Music] he gives us a seal of the holy spirit so then it is your soul that has been redeemed when we go to Ephesians if let us start from Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30. Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30. the scripture says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption so much praise the name of Allah so he says he gives us the holy spirit means finished one foreign [Music] that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ is in whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe you were still with the Holy Spirit of promise foreign that's the scripture now the falsely anointed ones we receive the spirit let us look at it in the nature foreign so you can express the gift of the Holy Spirit without the Life of Christ foreign expressing the same gifts of the holy spirit that's not what we want praise the name of Allah so here what we want is have the words and the Holy Spirit comes in a time comes at your home they receive it in Acts chapter 8 they had received the word but then when they laid hands on them the same thing in Acts chapter 10 when Peter spoke these words when Peter spoke these words they received the word and as they received their wife then the Holy Spirit that's the same principle of God praise the name of us you know it says the fruit of the spirit but where does the spirit bear is fruit the spirit Bears is true the Holy Spirit which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased position unto the praise of his glory where single boobs ready so he says the holy spirit is the earnest of our inheritance you know we it's declaring to us that more is yet to come when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit it doesn't mean you don't have weaknesses that doesn't mean that let us go to Romans chapter 8. and then verse 26 likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered um and he that such as the hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because it makes intercession for the sense according to the will of God reminding you of the word when you find you are going astray no you cannot live a Victorious Christian Life without the Holy Spirit you just lead the Holy Spirit when we accept the Lord and then we are filled with the Holy Spirit it is the soul that has now been redeemed but the bodies you are living in have not been changed it is the same body that is born in sins it is how you still resemble it is you are still living in the same body somebody that used to fear it is that somebody that used to be tempted that still under different Temptations so our bodies have not yet been changed but then the Soul has been changed the soul has been transformed but this body I am a village it becomes worse as you grow older [Music] in Romans chapter 8 and then verse 21. and not only a day but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit even we our Sinners grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wait the Redemption of our body foreign [Music] as long as you are still in this bodies you'll always have weaknesses when the devil knew stand where together that Jesus wants to take over the whole world he came by that desire worship me as I give you all these guys and that's the same way but but we have got the power man defeat All The Temptations and he has given the Holy Spirit to give us the ability to empower us to live above our Witnesses so the Redemption of our foreign let us go to this message he turned them a young man the young woman why did he have to do that so they could receive the promised Sonoma and that is the next thing in order for the church we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for we shall be changed in a moment to receive the promised son where is it going to come down here on Earth don't meet him here on us and we couldn't meet him in this kind of bodies he says we don't meet him on us you know that's the time of the rapture we don't meet him in these bodies you know but we meet him in in the bodies that have been changed we've got to be changed to meet him in the air the body will be changed in a moment and we shall be caught up together to meet the Lord praise the name of Allah they would not bear so God had to fast change their bodies God has to change our bodies when we are in the motor bodies then we shall be able to submit Christ we shall be changed we shall be changed so from this this part and then we shall meet Christ you know when Christ tonight why do crystal way Alpha the Bible says in Acts chapter 2. you went to hell yeah he went to Hell by his by ethiophany and now he preached the souls that were in prison he resurrected the body that had died and now it became a glorified body right now we are living in natural bodies but now when you leave us when you sleep when you die there is if you find anybody waiting for you that's what the scripture says II Corinthians chapter 2 Corinthians chapter 5. and then verse one for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle you're dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens second Corinthians 5. second Corinthians is for in this we've grown earnestly Desiring to be closed upon with our house which is in heaven if so be so be that being closed we shall not be found naked praise the name of us the scripture is telling us when this the Bible says celestial bodies and the bodies tell us you but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of that Celestial is another name so now as we have received the importance of companies born again we receive bodies you had to be born and born with the body of the earth we receive Heavenly Bodies now in Philippians Philippines he says for our conversation is in heaven from what we also look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ foreign is in heaven now the question how were you how did you become a citizen here on us you had to be first born why not yourself it will be born by the by the root of God that which is born of the flesh that is born of the spirits waiting for you yeah when you die from this body in heaven in other words you just change your Dwelling Place and then the Bible says that doesn't have any weakness but in the heavenly bodies born again actually confirms that we have bodies in heaven videos the Bible tells us Bible yet to cover praise the name of us that the Lord saying [Music] praise the name of our Lord there we go to verse 16. the Bible says for the Lord himself descend from heaven okay let us start from the back from 14. for we believe that Jesus died on the rose again even Sodom also which sleep in Jesus will God bring foreign then Christ remains in amazing people in their theophany bodies they come down here and yeah and when they get here on us they pick their bodies that were corrupted and then when they picked their birds that were corrupted it's not yet time foreign foreign [Music] beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet here what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is the name of Allah the Bible says when we see him we shall be who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like his glorious body according to the working whereby he is ever even to served you all things unto himself foreign foreign [Music] but the difference is can be eaten by animals these bodies these bodies while bodies are not our inheritance now you start asking yourself how much money do you spend on this body and if you're investing in something that doesn't last sentence what the loss you're doing praise the name of our lord it's not good it's not bad to put to invest in your body are you investing rightly or not you can have lunch of 50 000. but how much are you doing for the kingdom of God it doesn't matter whether you elevate This Grass to whatever status you remain grasses you know all those countries we look at Europe America everywhere why the answer is also green yeah and they also need s even the people go to the moon the food on the moon cannot sustain them they have to pack from here these bodies it doesn't matter the status and once you the life leaves this body the most honorable thing you can do to that body is video was foreign is done with Christ then it will come and pick this corruptible body to have all become a girlfriend now let us then look at the glorified body for a short time let us go to John chapter 20. and then verse 24. but Thomas John chapter 20. verse 19. then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of Jews came Jesus and stood in their midst and Saints unto them peace be unto you foreign his hands and his side then where the disciples glad when they saw the Lord is now the Bible says the disciples and then Jesus comes in their meetings and then they were glad so the body which is glorified is a higher form of bodies and these bodies these bodies we're leaving I cannot pass through a world cannot stand before they are not knocked today these bodies that we live these bodies that we're living cannot walk on the water but now the glorified body our Lord Jesus Christ then the bodies that we're living here let us go to Luke chapter foreign foreign and it came to pass as he said to admit with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight Amazon foreign body let us go to Second Kings chapter 2. second Kings chapter 2. and then we read in the Green University and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha what shall I do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray to let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me it is foreign but if not it shall not be song Buena foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] the Bible tells us when the sleeping Saints arose in Matthew chapter 27. they were seen of many people but when their time of going up to heaven came nobody saw them are you getting it even our Rapture when our bodies are changed at the time to meet Christ in the air comes the people living on us are not going to see us so it's a form of body the Bible says when Jesus yes let us go to Luke chapter 24. and then verse 50. Luke chapter 24 and then verse 15. the scripture says and he led them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was spotted from them and carried up into the heaven now but brother Branham teaches about he laid captivity captive organ again when we go to Psalms 68 verse 18. Psalm 68 18. he says LED captivity captive or severe obsidable then in Psalms chapter 22 24 and then verse 7. it says lift up your heads or you get and be lift up you Everlasting those and the king of glory shall come in foreign who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle yes lift you up your heads or you get even lift them up you Everlasting those and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the Lord of hosts he is the king of glory praise the name of our Lord says this was now Christ foreign [Music] [Music] soccer okay but in the message the Rapture now notice but wait again you've had three Witnesses we've already had three raptures in the Old Testament yes do you know that as a witness Elijah was the other area and Jesus was the other one yes there are three ruptures and the first Rapture of the New Testament happened for the Old Testament since when Christ took them to Heaven praise the name of Allah and then the second rapture is the rupture of the New Testaments from the time that Christ resurrected we can talk of the Apostles we are part of the second Rapture that is going to happen now the second Rapture happens but the second coming of the Lord Jesus will be in Revelations Elijah and Moses after their Ministry to the Jews so God has given us this message and the message that he has given us is a message that changes us it has the ability it is the word of God in the power of God to transform us from our weaknesses from our failures our Assurance now that these motor bodies that we have received from inside praise him Overlord we have been born again we have received the word of God you have received the spirit of God so by that transformation from within us [Music] it was the seventh watch es when they heard the voice before the bridegroom comments and we have got the voice in the seventh watch raise up and trim your lamps let us finish 4. 16 he says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise fast foreign foreign foreign now the third thing is a trumpet which is always the Feast of a trumpet if they're calling the people to the feast and that will be the brightest supper with the bride in the sky the first thing that comes first is his message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping the ones that died back in the other ages that's the thing that takes place we are right there you know foreign and then they will Ascend then we shall also follow them and all of us together we shall meet the Lord we shall be changed do you believe that your ticket is that amen amen we shall be changed so it doesn't matter what you're going through just without the assurance that God has already changed within me I'm now waiting for the full Redemption of this body is it doesn't matter what sickness the devil can put in this world it doesn't matter what social status the Assurance we need to have we shall be changed and I'm not praying to God God first give me this before I leave I want to be changed we shall be changed whether we have achieved in
