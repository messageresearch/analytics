preeminence Lord and take full searching of Allah speak to us Lord and to bless us in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen let us go to Ezra chapter six reading from verse 11 to verse 15. also I have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word let Timber be pulled down from his house and being and being set up let him be hung there on and let his house be made a downhill for this is [Music] [Music] and the god that has caused his name to dwell there destroy all Kings and people that shall put their hand to Altar and Destroy This House of God which is at Jerusalem I Darius have made a decree let it be done with speed [Music] is governor on this side River and their companions according to that which Darius King had sent so they did speedily uh um and the Elders of the Jews build it and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and Zachariah the son of Ido and they builded and finished it according to the Commandment of the god of Israel and according the Commandment of Cyrus and dairas under Texas King of Persia um and this house was finished on the third day of the month Ada which was the 60th year of the reign of Darius the king room may God blessing of his word something you may be seated I want to preach on the subject from verse 14. and it says that and the Elders of the Jews build it and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai so I want to preacher prospering through the prophecy of Elijah praise the name of Allah through the prophecy of Elijah let us try to expand this word prophesy rather prospering so now when we go to Joshua chapter 1 soccer husband in Joshua chapter 1 and verse 7 yes he says only be those strong and very courageous that though May observe to do according to all the laws which Moses my servant commanded turn not from e to the right hand or to the left that you may Prosper whatsoever praise the name of our Lord so then you see here God is telling Joshua yes all the law that Moses has commanded praise the name God had given them and then he demanded that they follow the word of God that observe to do all the law don't turn to the left or don't go to the right hand side but do everything according to what is when you do that you will prosper in the whatsoever things you do and everybody wants to prosper but here the principle of God of prosperity is by us following the one that he has given us you don't turn to the right the things that are easy for you you don't turn to the left maybe the things that are hard for you but we want you to walk in the middle line right following the word you don't fall to the side of many people or you don't fall to the side of you know whatever but you know just to follow the word exactly and then he's saying when you do that then you will prosper praise the name of it then in verse 86 this book of the Lord shall not depart out of your mouth but you shall meditate there in day and denial that you may observe to do according to all that is written there for then you shall make your way prosperous and then you shall have good success every day we struggle to have good success every day we struggle you know to be prosperous [Applause] but then here the Bible is giving us the principles the law of God or the word of God should not depart out of our mouth but we need to meditate upon it is and when you meditate upon it watch for me when you think about it then you do what is there you obey what is written and now when you obey what is written then you make your way successful you make yourself prosperous now when we got Deuteronomy chapter six praise the name of Allah Deuteronomy chapter 6 and then verse the scripture says we are all Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and you shall love the Lord with all thine hearts with all thy songs and with all thy minds and then he says the same thing here personal [Applause] uh praise the name of it and and those that observe what is good Revelations praise the name of Allah so then he says I wish you are fast enough just the scripture blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein so God wants you to read what's according so we see that in the tournament is saying the one should be in your house and when the world is in your house think about you keep on hearing keep on you know reading it and when you hear it you read it you think about it it's in your heart then he says teach it talk about it [Music] does he know what you believe minimum so let the word of God rule in your place of wine the work you do how you behave yourself let the one take charge over there that when you speak somebody will know this guy is different when you do some action oh you do some kind of work somebody will know this person is different and then he says between you the flaunts of Lying Eyes you know it should be like your mirrors it should be like your your glasses you know you sit through the wire and you also see yourself through the world so your judgments your decision every kind of course of action you do in your life is based upon the world and then God said so the Bible says [Applause] and they prospered through the prophesying what were they building they were building the Temple of God and when we look what the elders when we go into the scriptures the elders in the New Testament and ministers they were doing the building and right now we are also building praise the name of Allah we are building the Temple of God in the Old Testament when they were building the temples when Solomon was building he had the peace but now when the temple was broken down and it was being revealed it was being built in the trouble last time they had a lot of oppositions they had many people were pulling them left and right now the enemy was against them when they were rebuilding the temple and here we are we are also the temple of God we are under construction but we need to know that even as the enemy is against us I wish they would control that sound praise the name of our Lord so the enemy is against us is doing everything he can to see that the work stops now the Bible says in First Peter chapter five and then verse 8 only come none praise the name of our Lord First Peter chapter 5 and then verse 8. be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil has a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may divide that's what the devil is doing is moving up and down whatever and you know Satan is not just settled in one place he goes this way again he comes in the morning he checks your condition have you prayed have you read the word well if you have prayed then he gets away yeah then around 10 o'clock he again comes at your place are you doing what you read or your dreams he finds your doing [Applause] in the face foreign let us go to Israel again foreign of captivity build the temple unto the Lord God of Israel available then they came to zalupa Bell and the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your God as you do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of escarhadon king of Assad which brought us up Caesars is now the Bible says when they are diversaries when they had they are building the Temple when the adversary when the adversary Center foreign it's kind of like a religious kind of affiliation they said let us build together we seek the same God but the question is before the construction why do they want to identify with the work when it is just starting when Satan Satan said that Jesus was hungry then he came as a friend oh you are too hungry the market is you may die along the way foreign [Applause] has commanded them [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] born again was something which was a curse in the country even in all foreign [Applause] are the people really getting saved praise the name of our Lord and then they say ah you you how many wants to be saved like when you attend some of these funerals and then the people raised their hearts and then they tell them oh now you confess like this don't like this they even deceive them that write my name in The Book of Life the Bible says the book of life was written before the foundation now which book are they writing deception and then they tell them that now but you know you are saved but the Bible says he that Believers and is baptized but then some of them say you will have baptized when you are young now which is fast to believe and be baptized to be baptized because the Bible he that believes and is baptized shall be saved but then for them they say are you baptized when you are yeah do you put the cat before the the the horse or it is the horse before they cut it which comes first check soccer [Applause] that is not in the Bible the true baptism is you must be immersed in the world in the name of Jesus Christ because the Bible says baptism you know you are being buried you don't bury people by sprinkling small soil on top of them so even baptism you must be immersed in the world praise the name of Allah but you see the devil has schemes of understand that may keep holding holding people to his side so here the Bible says Judah the hands they traveled them in the building and the Bible says in verse 5. they hired counselors against them you read it so they hired the counselors politicians to frustrate them the first one they came we worshiped the same God [Applause] religious Satan coming in a religious range to oppose now when he goes through the religious and maybe he has not been able to achieve then he goes through the political using politicians to frustrate to threateness and then when they failed that move when this for Captain building the Bible says and in the reign of ahasuelas in the beginning of his Reigns against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem foreign [Applause] death spoke in the whole thing and religious and demon powers mixed together praise the name of Allah when you read in Revelations chapter six about the Seven Seals and then you look what the Ghost Rider seals you see that in Revelations chapter six and then verse the Bible says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals what I heard as it were the noise of sand the empire one of the four beasts saying come and see um and I saw and behold a white horse so the devil was riding on a white horse as a deceiver as an impersonator coming in the religious Rings something like Ezra foreign the second series and there went out another host that was red and power was given unto him to take peace from the earth killing people so here he came as a political force and now on the third season he writes on the black horse demonic power that man again understand what the Devil comes and approaches these things so he says in the fourth season politics he is the king of politics sure as I have all went through it before all smart educations and things like that uh from the wrong side just follow it through the scripture find out if that is right follow Kane's children I see what they become then follow thesis children see what they want everybody not as not as I'm supposing I'm supporting ignorance not at all but you take any person so now you see how the devil follows him so then we see that in the rebuilding of the terms they were doing it under a lot of oppositions but now for them to be strengthened in the work of God God sent them a prophet [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] he wants to hold you down he wants to keep you out of the Kingdom he wants to keep you out of the blessing of God he wants to keep you not being prospered by the Lord but the Bible says now when God sent prophets the scripture says in Israel 5 2. foreign then Ross up the rubber Bell the son of shelter Joshua the son of zodiac and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them we are the prophets of God helping them yes God send them prophets helping them in the construction and then the scriptures that the Elders of the Jews when they were building the Temple they prospered [Applause] through the prophesying praise the name of Allah as we are under construction [Applause] so now God sent us a message in our generation and the message that God is what will make us ready for the Rapture is what will make us ready for the coming of Our Lord so in the season we're living you can never overcome us without the prophesy of Elijah the prophet Allah because God that sent us any time if you can take it to the word of God you will be able to overcome all powers but if you don't take it to the message foreign praise the name of our husband let us go to Genesis chapter 41. and then verse 53 a Canadian Genesis 41 53. the Bible says and the seven years of plentiness that was in the land of Egypt where ended up under seven years of death began to come according as Joseph had said and the death was in all the lands but in all the land of Egypt there was bread is [Music] and when all the land of Egypt was famished the people cried far out for bread and pharah said unto all the Egyptians go unto Joseph that his and what he says to you do is so here the Bible says it was not training there was no planting there was no harvesting and then everybody felt the famous [Applause] and then the Bible says 56. and The Feminine was over all the face of the Earth and Joseph opened all the store houses and sold unto the Egyptians and The Feminine walked somewhere in the land of Egypt Angela nebula and his owner you see and all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all the lives now you look what distression in Egyptian that there was severe feminine so terrible destruction was [Applause] praise the name of it and then the Bible says money failed in Egypt [Applause] to buy a loaf of bread that's how bad it was hyper inflation for example questions maybe you have to put the man on a wheelbarrow oh yeah to buy only one piece of bread manifold praise the name of our Lord and we should also know do you know that they are circumstances when money can failure money can fail says when the sickness is severeign pestilences people dying left and right manifest yes [Applause] it doesn't help you you have too much but you can't help it is the name of Allah and the Bible says your riches cannot help you in the time of trouble you may have a lot but it becomes useless so now we see at the destruction in Egypt in Genesis 47. and then verse 13. praise the name of our Lord the Bible says and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by the reason of famine whatever and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the corn which they brought they bought and Joseph brought the money into Farah's house and when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and saying give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money Faith a face is so if you have too much and it's not say sure oh it's not backed up by something solid any time it can collapse praise the name of our Lord so now when there are money failed because the Bible says they started bringing their animals so animals have greater value than money cavities when all they are animals were given over to Joseph then they started now selling their land for food is more valuable than animals and the animals are more valuable than the money so when you have more animals you are better than somebody just having money when you have more land you are better than somebody just having animals so you just need to learn the principles of the Bible depreciates but animals multiply foreign Bill gets the one of the richest men in the world he has bought a lot of farmland until they say is either one of the biggest Farm owners as an individual in the U.S America because they know where the real value is so we see that in Egypt all the animals we are taken by pharaohs and even all the land was taken by Pharrell and then the people became slaves [Music] so people should learn how to work hard and when you can maybe don't spend whatever you get some put it into somebody like if you are staying in your place the money you have why don't you put in an animal also right and you know there are some people they come from they get from only one chicken and then after one or two years that chicken has multiplied and they can get from that goats now they are talking in millions of Shillings not in thousands of Shillings praise the name of it so we also need to learn how the thing goes so now you see that money failed in Egypt that was the situation the Earth was going through yeah that was [Applause] foreign [Applause] praise the name of Allah he says now therefore be not grieved Nora angry with yourselves that you sowed me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life is for these two years has the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be hearing nor Harvest Moon see um and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance foreign so now it was not you that sent me hither but God that has made me a father to pharaoh and the Lord over all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt because so God sent them a prophet God sent them Joseph to be in their medicine and as long as they obey the prophesying of Joseph the land Prosperity praise the name of Allah it's also the same thing God has sent us a prophet in the end of time [Applause] [Applause] take them seriously praise the name of our Lord you know one thing about the life of brother Branham is that God was showing him things that where we are you that are everywhere and that are to me praise the name of Allah he kept on revealing everything to him he showed him what is in here and then he showed him what is in here praise the name of our Lord you know beyond the curtain of time to know that the people believe the message this is the place that God has ordained for him this is the place that God has towered for us so it is not a blind message [Applause] praise the name of us we have the sure word of prophecies like when Joseph told Pharaoh we are going to have seven years of playing but when it came to pass preparations for ourselors [Applause] oh Father [Applause] [Applause] kept Egypt never at that time they were following that but right now that's how we have the shoe Award of prophets we am the sure word of prophets that the Lord has given unto us so you need to believe that way to prosper in all that you do wherever you go take the message and the message talks about different things different ways as a young woman the message he talks about how you're meant to conduct yourself as a young man I say husband the message talks about how you're meant as a wife The person talks about how your Mentor each and every one of them God has given us the sure word of prophecies [Applause] [Music] I have to put on time demons you're not going to prosper by that foreign [Applause] less though and thy household and all that though Hast come to Poverty is the name of our Lord so you see famine brings poverty praise the name of Allah famine brings poverty actually in life the thing you spend most of your money on is food event we are seeing that might have percentage and even in the Uganda Bureau of Statistics did that research they found around the 40 around 40 percent of somebody's income is spent on food [Applause] we can't live by ourselves now that's a bad condition we know praise the name of us and each of us as God has given you ability put your hand to work but when it comes to the US you are deprived like Lazarus could not afford rent so he was always on the money's gate we shouldn't be like that Lazarus could not afford the meal he was always the wanting those cramps which come from the rich man history you shouldn't be like that praise the name of Allah could not go to hospital he couldn't afford the medical bills so he was all having wounds until dogs were licking them you shouldn't live like this we have the promises for God to give us all that we have problems it is God who said God and keep the garden praise the name of Allah if you are in school be serious with your training and learn those skills say that you Excel and become and become a better profession of that if you don't have any skills they are also jobs for people without skills [Applause] and when you are there be humble and learn from the one who knows like nowadays oh I don't have a job anymore you go and be a tire man [Applause] spanner you keep on asking him which tool should I bring I know Susan the names of those tools [Music] because it can be an interview for a driver they bring the tools they use in the garage and then they ask him if I want to remove the tire which tools do I use you're not going to say you're going to use a rope no you don't know all those are skills you are learning how they have to I have to get a jacket and I have to prepare it you know I have to get a span you know I have to get this you know those are skills you are learning from being a time a tire man or a tiny man now you become a driver he's being a driver but now maybe you become a planting mechanically and then there now you can know how which spells to you you have got skills so people should do desire to work don't start saying oh you know my parents they didn't take me to school how long would you keep on lamenting about your parents you need to move out and work via your Joker praise the name of Allah whether it is maybe kind of like lifting blocks can't do that oh yeah and then as you lift blocks as you mix they put the bricks on the walls you are gaining skills and do not belong you are an expert in what you're doing praise the name of it so famine brings poverty the Bible says in almost chapter 8 and then verse 11. Amos they live in and then almost chapter 8 verse 11. the Bible says behold the days come says the Lord that I will send a feminine in the land not a famine of bread Nora is asked for water but of hearing the words of the Lord lover is and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it so the Bible says [Applause] he's going to send famine in the landing is a famine of hearing of the word of God hearing the word of God now if you are going to here then there has to be somebody to speak but he says Famine of hearings the words of God and the word is God so the Famine of hearing God speaking praise the name of us and then we said foreign foreign and he went out to meet ASA and said unto him and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord is with you while you be with him and if you seek Him He will be fond of you but if you forsake Him He will forsake you now for a long season three things foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] foreign so then the Bible says they were without God through God they are without the teaching priests they were without the Lord and that can be a condition of an individual or it is the condition of the age of loudness they don't know the true God because they have rejected the message they don't have the word of God because they don't care for you three things so then it brought a condition of famine Famine of hearings they don't want to hear God from the time the Bible says [Applause] he calls Israel to sin against God by bringing him the two cups that he brought in First Kings chapter 12 David and then verse 25. then shechem in Mount Ephraim and drilled there in and went out from thence and built panel foreign to the House of David if these people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of these people turn again unto their lord even at rehoboam king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam King of Judah oh abant yes where upon the king took counsel and made two cups of God and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy gods or Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt is foreign of the people which were not the sons of Levi najiga that was first verse 31. nothing is amen amen now you see [Applause] the kingdom to go from him he devised in his heart that now I'll make two cars of God foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign and then verse 14. Second Chronicles chapter 11 verse 14. for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to Judah and Jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had the cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the Lord is and the ordaining priests for the high places and for the devils and for the cows which had he had made a way before [Music] praise the name of Allah the Bible says that the Levites left their suburbs and their positions praise the name of it they left their Villages they left their Investments they left their positions and they went to Judah and Jerusalem why we're actually to serve the Lord in the place where they were which foreign [Applause] [Applause] it comes to a time of decision foreign [Applause] [Applause] we want you to give them all back together I have nothing of myself but I give you everything praise the name of that in the message the unfailing reality of the Living God who says God can only use what we give to people now but there is a lot of you will say I'll give him 15 minutes on Sunday If You Preach any longer than that I'll just go get up and go home well you got 15 minutes on Sunday that's what you give to God what can you give to God God will receive what you will give you but God once you're all I end up with a winner I end up with you praise the name of us all from us you remember the time of Corona you know in the first corner of 2020. even hospitals were closing down even big schools like Buddha we are telling their teachers who are supported by parents please this is Nani paid leave one they made money until to be on oxygen for only one day three millions are five million there's somebody in the building I don't have many millions unfortunately the person died and then they wouldn't release the dead body until you pay them there but now if being on Nokia they were charging five Millions how much do we need to pay to God foreign how much can you pay to God you have to preserve some oxygen in my house foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] surrender to him that he can lead you and guide you and put you into places where he wants you to go again lead of him God wants all of us and he wants all of you everything you have God wants you praise the name of Allah God also wants your talents God wants your possessions put them into his use put them into his kingdom praise the name because it is he who has made your being it is who gives you understanding in our hearts he's the one who gives you the understanding he's the one who gives you the ability the message prepares us for the Rapture the message prepares us for the second coming of God now in the message things that are to be moved a prophet is a reflect of God he is so that he cannot speak his own words it has to be Goddess that is speaks he is just like a reflector and he is goddess mouthpiece we've had the mouthpiece in this place take him to the message [Applause] and you will profess prosper in the message as long as you hear the message you are obeying the message the message will make you prosperous man the message you will make you prosperous doing the things of God following the things so now we see that in the times of Israeli there was feminine and then we see that in every time of Elijah in the time of the faster in the times of Elisha Mexico in terms of John the Baptist there was also feminine of hearing the words you know they were following the traditions of Maine and now when they had the word of Christ they couldn't take him because they were following Traditions they were used to the Traditions like in the time of the robots so even now in the end time the Bible says there will be Famine of here [Applause] but the Famine of hearing them comes because people have rejected the truth in second chronicles [Applause] [Applause] [Music] they rejected the ministers foreign it was a condition of rebellion against these things which are going to give an example as I try to wind up praise the name of Allah let us go to the Book of Jeremiah chapter 18 and verse 18. the Bible says then say they come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah for the Lord shall not perish from the priest Nora cancer from the wise nor at the word from the Prophet come let us might him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words unfortunate yeah [Music] they said let us get devices [Music] put them off from their work s so they were without teaching priests and then they said Prophet the word always comes to the prophet said no don't hear anything he tells you uh and the Bible says let us might them with the tongues let us talk even against them let us not give it to whatever they are saying let us block our ears and this is what the GC generation is doing it has blocked their ears to the message they have put away the message they are put down the messenger no we don't have anything to do with that we don't want to hear that one we don't want to hear that they were telling this man who was healed for us we have Moses for that man we don't know then he said that man was born in the scene that man is the prince of Belize there was mayor in Jesus that nobody would hear him you can imagine even but can you imagine they were planning to kill Lazarus because the miracle of Resurrection was great yet it was part of the scripts so they are planning to hit to kill him so that people don't follow Jesus because where did the spirit of God yeah [Applause] [Applause] the son of Hosea and all the people from the list even to the greatest came near uh and said unto Jeremiah the prophet let we be City our supplication to be accepted before you and pray for us unto the Lord thy God even for all discriminant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes
