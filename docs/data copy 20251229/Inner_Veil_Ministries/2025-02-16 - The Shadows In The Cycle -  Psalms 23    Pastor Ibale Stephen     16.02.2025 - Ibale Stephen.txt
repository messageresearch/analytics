not trying to see whether it holds amen you came and you'll make it and you'll make it amen are you happy this morning yeah uh there is a brother from Kenya somewhere here can you stand up brother yeah God bless you shom nice to see you he has been calling me for a few days to really know where the church is so this is your home church as long as you are in ginger God bless you Shalom um this is brother he requests for our prayers he has a business so let's stand up do you love him are you ready for a blessing there's no need to talk defeat amen let's have word of prayer precious Heavenly Father we give thanks and honor to you for the grace that you have bestowed upon us and for the love that you shed abroad our hearts you loved us Lord when you gave your own life that you may redeem us and make us like the what a blessing it is when you call us Brethren father we want to appreciate you and this morning as we come together father we bring brother Joshua who has a trip Lord that you may accept to go with him to I also pray father protect him and prosper him will you also father bless the word which is going to be read and also preach to the hearts of the people open the sus of the people's hearts and hide your word in water it by the Holy Spirit and cause it fruit in season in Jesus name amen amen so we are going to turn to the Book of Genesis and that is chapter amen Genesis 8 and we are dealing with verse 22 that's our initial scripture while the Earth remain seed time and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not Cee those are things that will continue happening over and over again as long as Earth and harvest shall continue all the cold and heat will [Music] continue all the summer and the winter will continue and night will continue may the Lord that blessing to the reading of his word amen you may be seated pray with me the service so that the Lord May impart something upon us today I have a title the shadows in the cycle Psalms 23 23 amen so the shadows in the cycle and then Psalms 23 so that is the cycle of nature now as described in Genesis 8 ver all vegetation must navigate through those seasons and we shall take this to bring it into the Natural Life of man that there are certain things that will never ceas but we just need to depend on the LA to help us negotiate all these things in life that's why the song writer says you count your bless I mean your trial is a blessing amen so Psalms 23 verse1 the Lord is Myer I shall not now David revelation of God as described by his different I mean attributes he knew him as Jehovah sh he as Jehovah he knew him as Jehovah Shalom he knew him through all his seven Redemptive names so in whatsoever situation he entangled amen he knew that the Lord is my shepher there is no condition that you'll ever get into that God will not have an attribute that will address that condition so a shepher will always have a full program for the ship when he opens up the ship for to the ship out he has a proper program from the time he opens the ship out amen the time he comes back in with the ship we want to thank God before I continue for the grace of God that was able to deliver sister aliel amen and also Brother John so that they had the it has been a battle but even in there so brother Fred me that I appreciate you for your prayers amen so you know God has a proper program for the ship when he opens the Shen you know he knows where they gra it just doesn't open so that the ship May Lo he knows where to lead the ship he knows where they'll go for water he has the security plan for the ship amen that's the way the Lord deals with us you just wake up in the morning and you say Lord lead me not amen he knows what you have need of he knows all the dangers the Sheep will face he knows about the wolves in the field but the secur plan is to restore the ship back into the he knows one may just kind of stray but he knows when to live the 9 to go and look for that one so amen that's the doctrine of eternal security are you together with me there is what we call eternal security you know the teaching on eternal security was too hard for the prophet own amen until after the opening of The Seven seal but I want to say without eternal security we would never make it we are what we are because the ship and I mean the shepherd has all the plans he says I know all the plans I have for you at the end of it all the plan for good not the plan for bad so it doesn't matter what Shadows we go through in life all that is for our own good when you didn't have a meal was for your good whether you're married or you're not married believe God knows about it and for the situation where you are it is for your own girl are you together with me amen eternal security is goding [Music] because that seed is eternal and it's a part of him are you together with me so God watches over you as you negotiate from the shadows in the Cy of life into the full St of a perfect man amen you grow negotiating through SE C and winter and summer is not going to be the same all the time amen we are going to come through situations where you even sometimes be tempted to question where is God in this that could be your winter time amen you are so cold sometimes you may not even be able to lift up your hands and be able to pray while you are in that condition there is still something deep down on the side which keeps telling you you are my son amen those are just shadows in the ccle those moments are what we call the shadows in the cycle of Life talk about you know we shall talk about the temperate climate temperate climate like those climate where we have snow summer winter things like that you know some of the seeds are planted before winter winter amen and you know winter is so cold you are counting in the negative you don't count into the positive you count into the negative amen and sometimes it even snows and it becomes the block on the floor but remember there is some seed in the ground are you together with me that's the way God works he allows the seed to negotiate that I mean that shadow in the amen some of them are planted six eight weeks before winter amen like you know the B planted much earlier they must Brave the snow and come all the way to the Harvest say brother Sten you don't know what I go through I don't have to know what you go through God knows what you got amen and he's going to watch you through all these cycles of Life their effects during the changing weathers upon the pennial plants like trees but you see they go through the Shadows of the cycle because time comes when it's not joy and the Glory Hallelujah you know you are so cold you are like John the Baptist in prison you are saying are you one we should wait for another one those moments come they come in our families they come in our Christian lives they come in our economy they come in our businesses and sometimes you question is this the right PA are you together with me but even then God is not far away the Lord is my shepherd I shall not praise the Lord so there are effects like when the weather is changing from Summer before it goes into winter there is what we call the fall amen so all the trees begin to live their lose their leaves because of the shter time of life because it gets so I mean it gets dark so early and so the trees they kind of get to lose their leaves because they don't have enough energy without the light to hold those leaves amen and yet the tree would have wanted those leaves and the light because that's the way they Fe are you together with me but God allows those situations and he says sit time and timeat and C winter and summer shall not see the tree gets into that situation this year and again is get in the same situation the next year are you together with me so sometimes you may go to the pastor I do not know why I am going through this but remember that it is a cycle of life you are not going to be all Hallelujah every dayjah hallelujah hallelujah moments will come when you just need to trust God when the answer is not there you have prayed and seems like heaven has closed but that's how you feel it's just a dark moment in a CLE of life but God has not deserted you amen the trees know how to prepare for that moment they lose their leaves so that they can conserve the moisture Amen in them because they are going in a rough time are you together with me so they dro the tree I mean the leaves because the leaves would make the water the moisture expire during the Sun so spiritually speaking these moments could be described by the words of theist amen says even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death amen I fear no evil amen praise the Lord I know that storms will gather around you sometimes storms will gather around the family but I want you to know that those are just shadows in the cycle of life amen nature will always expect them because the Bible says as long as life is amen those conditions will never cease praise the Lord this morning so I want to use this cycle to describe the cycles of life that will forever live with us trials will always be with us Temptations will always be with us will always be with us moment in our families will always be with us so you better learn how to depend on the Good Shepherd hallelujah hallelujah whatever situation comes the Lord is my sheer the Lord in what attributes May Jehovah shalom is what I need but he will always be God in the seven Redemptive name all those situations will be there but all in know the grace to take us through the shadows will also be there with us amen so this Shadow sometimes they very prominent in the history of a Christian but God will focus on how constant on how constant you kind of fall back to him amen you just kind of fall on the loving arms of Jehovah because you think here and there and you don't have an answer that's when the enemy comes and says you know what there is no God then you say God is there you prove then he changes this statement but he doesn't love you there are situations we go through you see there was we should know that we should always learn every day to take our daily sacrifice you know the daily sacrifice Lord Jesus have mer upon me I have made a mistake here I have fallen here I've done this here you just kind of keep your s clean so that God may not keep a distance from you amen so that you may always be close to Jehovah I want to remind you about the journey from Egypt to the promise which is a type of the work of a Christian the life of sin to the bom of the Holy together with me so there was the Feast of the Passover that theed you from the Egypt of sin and when you were delivered from the Egypt of sin then there is another Feast that you normally rely on the Feast of the atonement that the Lamb of God infected for you upon C amen you know the daily sacrifice the blood which never ceases to clean the believer will always be present but then even after the Feast of atonement we always have these daily sacrifices I'm talking about to pull the children Through The Dark Shadows amen if the devil has put a stain on you amen there is a light in the shadow to reveal these dos so that we may take them to God in confession in prayer and saying God have mercy upon me amen let me say it in this way maybe that Abraham our father had Shadows also in the Cy of his calling are you together with me Abraham the father of faith in his walk he experien certain shadows in the cycle of his call listen now on two occasions he feared famine just after he had settled in the land he ran out into Egypt amen and again he ran out a second time to J but on both occasions we see him sink the Shad you know he loses the sense of Victory God gave him he begins to fear the Nations around him he tells his wife say you are my sister don't say you are my wife but when he was in the land in full light amen he wouldn't fear the kings that invaded him so many times we would get into positions where Shadows kind of would want to make an eclipse between you and God our father abrah went through that it was a shadow when he came to his wife to have a son with h it was a shadow when Sarah and Abraham laugh at two different occasions when the Lord was confirming the Covenant to them Genesis 177 Abram laugh amen Bible says he fell on his back and laugh Genesis 1812 are you together with me those were all moments of Shadows in the cycle but remember you know the protection was always around the city I want you to begin in that you are a twofold being there is the which come from God Amen which is the it stays on the amen of the soul but then there is another you which is directly connected to the circumstances of life you are the one who gets hungry amen you are the one who lacks the the necessities of life and that's where the enemy tries to get to so that he can get access to the seed on the side are you together with me when you get into situations of real need and you are on the outside maybe you are sick maybe you are lacking you remember the you is [Music] on and there the devil can't get there amen those shadows will always crowd around the natural man but your election deep down on the side there so what we need is to ask God to pile word on top of word like that until we become the full St the Son of God or daughter of God hallelujah hallelujah so when that seed is fed on the word word it knows how to react when the situations come he was the word made manifest when he was on the mountain and the enemy came he knew how to react to the shadows in the C are you together with me so what we need is to ask God let the word work on my life amen let's talk a little bit about this etern the etal security is given to the inner man because he the one that is eternal amen he's the one that is eternal amen but this one here he dies amen and the only way can become Eternal is when he spoken again into the Rapture or into the resurrection amen praise the Lord so with eternal security God breaks the Heart of Stone by the teaching of the word that you may develop a broken and contrite spirit amen he breaks your nature he breaks your character and he does this to the amen E6 verse6 amen a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I take the St out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh amen so God begins to do a transplant a s amen he comes as a Serge now and he says I have come to give you a new spirit and when you have a new spirit then it means that this Heart of Stone has been taken away and if the Heart of Stone is taken away when the word come to us is always amen are you together with me because everything else that is not God gets pushed out of the Soul are you together with me and the only thing that remains there is that se that has got the ear of the spirit that when God speaks praise amen so the nature that fails and the nature that Rebels against God is totally expelled from the circles of the soul and it comes down to the human Spirit are you together with me that's where he lives that's where reasoning is but we thank God you are here because the Heart of Stone was broken so what you have has the ability to sayen when the word is spoken you know how to react to the word amen and now when he has given you a new spirit verse 27 says I'll put my my spirit within you amen Anda you hallelujah hallelujah you meaning that God over our lives and then he causes us not that we want but he causes us he takes control become love slaves he says I will cause you hallelujah hallelujah you God CA to come to church today Goda you to be here amen he says I'll cause you to walk in my statutes and shall keep my judgments and do them amen so you must however know that the cyc of life as I already said we have shadows as we Evol from the that tempor you amen and caus you to walk according the prince of the power of the air and the spirit that now work in the children of disob Amen praise the Lord he will cause you to evolve from the nature that made you live like the world but you are not part of the W but there was a force that hold of amen and kept in a shadow but deep Down On th there was a SE and there was an element of [Music] Life there was a life on side hallelujah hallelujah but then you waiting for God break the Heart of Stone and when the Heart of Stone breaks brother there is are coming to life to the seed gen of Life on hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen yes sir but you know I want to tell you today that when that seed gen comes to life it fasts for the world it I mean it hungers I mean it hungers it wants to be fed man shall not live by bread alone ask yourself how many times do I feed me I just feed this the me is on side you see with should and St the inner man just do the best you can to present yourself to this presence amen if it's possible never miss a service never think a midweek is a lighter service you know years ago years ago I used to preach the major things on Wednesday because that's when the Believers were at church on Sunday everybody would come to church are you together with me how many Believers are here God bless you Amen brother per green used to say green that you know Wednesday the ones who love God go to church Sunday morning those who love the church go to church but Sunday night those who love the pastor they come back [Laughter] praise the Lord You Know The Enemy much as the seed is bought he doesn't give up on you he keeps casting a Shad upon you and that's what I'm talking about the shadows in the cycle amen those Winters that come to disfigure the tree it doesn't need to be bear like that but it's going through a shadow hallelujah hallelujah I want to tell you one thing that much as we are born again doesn't give up on you the next time if the Lord allows when I stand here I want to speak on the statement of Paul that I Die daily he goes to the Cross daily so you know Jesus listen he was led of the Holy Spirit to the mountains to be tempted of the devil as long as that seed comes into the body of Flesh It suffers Temptation trials situations the enemy wants to buff the outside so that he could get the inside but Jesus being the word he defeated the Devil by saying it is written it is written it's written but even when he punched him down L 43 he says and when the devil ended all the temp he departed from him for a season he never leaves you permanently he left him for a season you are free by the blood of Cal but remember he only will never give up he try to get around by getting into the human spirit and brother Bram preaches the message the greatest B ever fall so you are in battle the devil tries to throw darkness in front of you that he may make him invisible amen and those that shadows and the shadow can only come because there is light so when those Shadows come then you know you got the LIE when you get convicted when you done something wrong you should know that deep down on the side there is light amen a sinner wouldn't care but a child of God you get a conviction that means there is light on the inside and when you get into that situation then you know it's a shadow in the cyle praise the Lord amen see you struggle with situations because the devil still lives somewhere in the middle he has access to your mind and sometimes you get offended because of the blun lies that come out of you the jealous fights that bother you those are shadows in the amen because you are human so we all as Paul says had our conversations in the time p in the last of our flesh filling the desire of the Flesh and of the mind and by Nature that children of WRA as others he doesn't say we are but he says in time P we just live like in the world are you together with me yeah say you know you just walking by the last of one flesh fill the desires of the mind and were by Nature the children [Music] of he doesn't say we are the time pass so God has called you out but then like he never left Christ he left him for a season the devil will always walk behind to see what you're thinking to see how you are handling your life but God who is Rich iny bles Us in Psalms 23 hallelujah hallelujah the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he doesn't allow the Sheep to go out of the ship without a shepher going together with the sh hallelujah hallelujah it's not where I want to go but where the Lord wants you to go amen he guides us he places the word before us that's why he says in verse two he make me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Water he my soul he me in the path of righteousness for his name sake Hallelujah Hallelujah so he has placed Us in Psalms 23 where he makes us in whatever we do we should always surrender he will [Applause] do amen it's you know it's him to Will and to do his good place yeah that's the thing we need to do every morning we wake up is to surrender so that the shepherd himself who has a good plan for us can lead the path of our life on a daily basis and this Shepherd here knows that you live in a addicting situation of Life there is this outer thing here wrestles against the in that's why David says a little bit but he rest my soul hallelujah hallelujah he restor my soul when he brings you into the path of righteous again he begins to lead you off what a love brother amen praise the Lord I pray that the Lord may give me the grace to bring this out to you this morning amen that shepher always knows where he was the Sheep to God Amen he is that sheep into areas of his choice pastures Still Waters amen praise the Lord so every one of us should always pray Lord reveal to me the mystery of your will amen don't you look for you know don't don't you just walk after somebody the sheer himself he has a plan for you amen every one of us is a different ver of the word amen the voice that I am you are not the voice that you are that's why our trials are not the same but yet the shepherd is the same you make us overcome maybe your trial is big like a job could be a smaller one even amen he was just going through the March that had come because of his condition of perfect man amen are you together with me yes sir the shepherd is aware of the Shadows he says you know DAV says I walk through the valley of the Shad of death I'll fear no evil for thou with me Ro and th stff they comfort me have you ever walked in the dark you always looking around you are fearful you know where you are stepping you are being very careful now like brother Joshua on the motorcycle and the snake you can imagine it's Darkness anything can happen but then there is a comfort that David is testifying that though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death fear no evil can you imagine God going with you in Valley of the Shadows of death she's the light that makes the shadow in the time of Darkness so whatever Shadow you go through is because the light is always with you love him friend what a God we serve am the shepherd is away of the Shadows along the way and it's those shadow that the W can try to hide so that they can be able to catch the Sheep but the sheer is always there and many times sheep is so unconscious of the danger in the shadows and it's in these Shadows that the sheep can lose focus of the sheer because there is the shadow of but yet the master himself will never lose sight of you his eyes upon every one of us he knows when your hair Falls amen he knows how much of the hair you've ever lost the shepherd keeps his eye over the ship that's why he knows that there is a ship that has stray amen will take him out of the way to go and get that ship amen oh my brother the shepher can through see through the shadows and he know when to use the road anduse the Stars to comfort the Sheep hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord he loves to carry his sheep yes sir but sometimes what he does is to use the road and the stuff are you together with me but when he uses the road that's another way of his are you together with me brother Bram tells a story and he say the old Shepherd story that was told in [Music] Jerusalem in the lands of the shepher was ping ship and he says why are you parking it for said it's got a broken leg how did it do that from a cff I broke its [Music] leg he said why you are CR sheer to break the ship's leg say no I loved it hallelujah hallelujah and St they comfort me and said it was going and I couldn't make it mind me so I broke it SL so that I could give it some extra attention so then it would love me me that's theer that's the wisdom Ro and stff sometimes God has to let us break down a little bit in health to give us a little extra attention to get us up on his amen B the doctor says amen nothing can be done then he take us in his BOS see I love you I'm going to get you well doesn't that just make life a little better are you seeing those Paradox areas those Paradox amen you just cannot understand why you are going through what you are going through that's the road and stuff to help you in the [Music] shadow then the ship finds cannot run anymore cannot run one time he had a sheep like that and his name was jaob he broke his leg and he walked different he was careful in what he was doing he was not fast sometimes some of us are too fast in the things we do we don't wait upon the we don't mind him that's the reason the ship was broken can I said Lord break us it's strange isn't it but you see that's the only way he can take the Sheep it was running fast it was going astray he couldn't get it says I have to get you back into the amen God will allow to break some of us to get us back in the fall okay now verse five is very interesting sometimes we are just encircled by forces we don't understand people that you cannot explain they make your life very uncomfortable the Bible is calling them enemies they could be neighbors they could be false Brethren they could be situations in your life that wants to take away your peace all those are shadows in the cycle you just get down to your door and the neighbor begins on you you g through those kind of situations God promises that you should not lose your peace even with those Hees he cares that you overcome and he says though prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup so the shepherd doesn't want the Sheep to lose their sleep over the negative environment around the amen there could be trials there could be tribulations of some kind there could be WS around the ship but when that one happens then David would say the Lord is my shepher I shall not you remember the time when J was sacrificing in the time of War when the angel of the Lord came down to consume the sacrifice he identified himself for the first time as Jehovah shalom hallelujah hallelujah when those situations come amen as a sh the covah Shalom amen live in set a table just settle down he'll anoint you and your cup will run over I want tell you there's nothing that the devil does that will bring you down in the shadows in the cycle will always be there 33 will go with you through the cycles amen verse David now confirms goodness and Mery shall follow me all the days of my life I in the house of the Lord forever Lord to be part of the house of the Lord yes sir why do I walk away from the ship praise God when we've got a God who cares amen so the shadows in the cycle unnecessary to clean out our house because wherever tension Rises around us God will always come down with words of instruction with words of Correction therefore you serve God is not throwing you away because the cyle has shadows in it stay in the right word atmosphere until the word breaks out let there be light hallelujah hallelujah you remember the shadows in the creation the Holy Spirit never went out he stayed there until he says Let there and the light was the word how we desire to dwell in the word praise the Lord stay in the right word atmosphere no not that there is no light but there is enough light in there to clear out the Shadows there's a light in the seed gen and it's a growing light it's a growing light growing amen Bram says when a man is saved that much of him is God that much of God that much of him is God when a man is saved that much of him is God yes because there is a match of God in him so he becomes a little March Of God that's the little light that comes in to make you quit doing what is wrong now if you can take all the malice and stri and Bel out that little button like of light and the power of God will keep growing growing growing growing cring out [Music] unbelief and you don't do it by exaltations of Bly exercise no the light grows you do it by Sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you so what brother Bram is saying is that God has deposed a amount of light in you and as that grows it crowds out the Shadows Of Darkness one day you will be a church without spot or because that light grows amen and I'm sure as we are sharing the word here the light on the inside is growing amen it is exposing certain dark areas there are certain things you are throwing out that's how the light grow amen so but brother Steven I am all Shadows yes but the little light will keep growing amen it will keep growing there is something you feel in you which you said this is God that will grow amen am brother Bram says though I walk through sh of the Valley of Death it could not be the dark and yet have a shadow praise the Lord though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death some people sayy but it doesn't say that it's the Valley of the shadow of light I mean of of death which means if it was Darkness then there couldn't be a shadow the shadow is because there is light there light ofine I'm going to let it shine This Little Light of Mine amen I'm going to let it shine there a little light of mine I'm going to let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine it could not be dark and a shadow for there has to be a certain percent of light it can be a shadow it was perfectly dark if was if it was perfectly dark there would be no Shadow though I walk through the shadow of the Valley of Death hallelujah hallelujah so every one of you you are here because there is a certain amount of light if there was no light you wouldn't be here but there is a light that has brought you to the service today and my prayer is let that light keep growing the light is in the se but the Shadows crow in the human spirit that's where the Shadows are amen so that the soul could not really be able to command the manifestation of God on the outside man so in the S is the light of Revelation and Po in Revelation I mean Ephesians he said the of your understanding one time brother Bram preached the eye of God Amen that you [Music] see eye of God and the eye of God is in the CG hallelujah hallelujah and in there is where the ear of understanding is the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that he may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the S so what's the light in there for the light on side amen is the only way you can be able to see God in the [Music] darkness you discern his presence sometimes you know when you are a Christian you can be able to see God see God by the you will be able to sense if there is a certain form of Darkness trying to crowd that light okay so the light on the inside exposes the shadows in the cycle so that you can apply the blood on those Shadows this one here is Darkness this one is Darkness this one is darkness and you keep applying the blood that's why you thear of your soul not because you are a Darkness but because there are certain Shadows to deal with are you together with me yeah sometimes the devil come and tell you you don't have life the reason why you hate sin is because you have light you ask God help me that I may fight this thing out of my life and the more you get the light of the knowledge of the word is the more the Shadows that you are dealing with are exposed because light and darkness cannot dwell together amen so when you are born again the soul becomes the seat of God in the let me say it this way maybe I'll say it ahead as we go then what happens is that when you are called out of the temporary capture the devil had over you in the life of then the light gets into the soul and the Shadows they migrate down into the spirit that's where the devil you see the shadows live in your human Spirit area and then you have five gats there the affection affection amen that's now the choices of Life the devil sits right there to keep [Music] say and then you look at it affection conscious that things that that awaken your interest amen you see that's now where the Shadows operate from the memory the negative Paths of life where you smoked from where you drunk from the night clubs you attended mem those are shadows in the cycle reason the way you choose to think amen imagination the meditations of your human you know devil gets right there so the Shadows then they begin to brew forth in the last of the eye the last of the flesh the pride of life okay so these Shadows are the Flesh in battle against the attributes of God in your and then you have those battles if you really do not know you may think that you are not a child of God but remember luk a while so brother Bram preaches the message the greatest B ever fall and he says if countries are going to fight they choose a neutral ground where they can put the battle and your human spirit is a neutral ground that's where unbelief Le hallelujah hallelujah and then all these Temptations they br right in there that's why Paul says here in Galatians 5:17 for the flesh against the spirit of God and the spirit of God against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that he cannot do the things that he would do that's the greatest but it bruis on the inside of you and you'll win this battle by believing what God says about you and you amen yes sir that's how we overcome let us go into Romans 12 and verse one here look at it to renew your mind you have to have something your mind to overcome in this batt Amen in Romans 12 verse1 I besek you therefore Brethren by the meres of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service meaning that you must deny your body not to become the agent of the Fallen Spirit are you together with me you say no I have plac it upon the altar amen that's why you choose to dress right amen your human Spirit would have wanted to look tight and smart as many people would call it smartness praise the Lord you know but you put those on the o you treat your body as dead to the desires of the human Spirit are you together with me you consider it dead the only way you can allow it to perform is if there is a command from the soul and then brother Bram talks to the Indian chief how are you doing good bad what is it two dogs in there fighting black dog white dog which wins the battle the one you feed most so if you [Music] feed yourself on social media there's nothing word in there then you are going to lose the battle but when you get into verse two be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind how can you renew your mind you renew your mind by staying in the word because the word gives you Alternatives you can't renew your mind without allowing in Alternatives that's the greatest B ever fall it bruise Inside the Mind amen and you'll win against that battle by Renewing Your Mind and when you renew your mind you begin to understand what God says about you hallelujah hallelujah and when you know what God says about you you begin telling the devil What God Says okay I am an elect seed gen of God I am a born again son and daugh of God God loves me I am like the of his [Music] ey and it's because of me that he died on C the devil begins to hear you know who you are when the devil knew who Jesus was he walked away praise the Lord so you are the pure virt sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and every woman born of the spirit of God and was in the blood of Jesus Christ and believe every word of God as though you never seen that the first place you are perfect amen so these shadows will always bother you because they've got the access to your human spirit so we are in a constant battle but if you are light on the inside you will always cry against them and God will come down amen if you have the light in the S brother you'll always fight those Shadows you know when they come I'll give you this qu here did you do you remember we dealt with eternal security being a of God is in itself an eternal security because it has eternal life amen it's eternal but yet when it's deped in here it comes into battle and you have to fight the but the way you fight the battle you begin it from the angle of an overcomer are you together with me you are going to battle and you are telling the enemy you are the loser listen the Al and Omega is the same here and here is the same material okay I am Al and Omega then he says he never said anything in between was there no problem so many of them that's where the battles were but he was the Overcomer of your battles I love it I am Al and Oma the first and the last the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the last message is the same I was in I am in Omega there will be a day that won be called day or night but in the evening time shall be life and Omega become the first and the last if you understand Say Amen I am Alpha here and I am Omega here hallelujah hallelujah he plants in season the right predestinated se but in the cycle it go through the seasons it cannot have but at the end here it will be the same seon I am Al and Omega what was planted will come to the Harvest but after it has gone through the sh C you will win your battles you will win your battles you will win your batt you will not lose look back at the first experience was your New Birth real to you did you get an experience did you get a visitation of God did you get a real conviction did you know that was God if you do that's the AL the beginning and then it will come to the Harvest C time time shall note in between here he knows what's going to be there there may be stones but at the end there will be a harest of the original SE amen so he plants the season I mean in the the right seat amen but it was in God's wisdom to put strength in the sea to overcome the Shadows of the Season like those seeds like a b which is planted before winter God puts enough strength in that seed to overcome the of the seasons and then come on this side to the harest god knew all your trials but he redeemed you all the same he knows the trials ahead of you but he never desert he knows about the winter how the leaves fall off but in the spring time amen the plant builds back and then begins to form the seed in the A and in the summer time they will come and eat the fruit so the cycle no wonder we are called the vineard of the Lord he knew how we are going to come through the Cy of trial will always repeat the strength to overcome has already been placed in You by God are you together with me Al and Omega is the same the life that began in the sewing season will come overcome the trials and come into the Harvest so when you go through hard trials don't despair God blessed the strength in the seed to overcome the trials the life that began in the sewing season will overcome these trials so in this Seasons the devil can power all kinds of negative things because he always be theil Heil it is impossible keep strengthening your position by knowing who you are listen to the words of brother I'm trying to find where to leave this subject he says if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God and that never leaves you hallelujah hallelujah he says if you are a son of God orter of God that never lives amen is with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it is still there it's just a staggering Fai but it never lives if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you is with you all the time but your faith Tak away from it but he still there amen that's why David says a right Spirit within listen in the message Luke he says now the thing of it is is come to a place where that all the stain of sin is washed away then you stand redeemed by the blood of the Lamb you are like he was before he fell you are a son of God washing the blood of God God's own blood okay so is God in the AL the amen intific Sanic of the Holy Ghost and it will be God in the fullness of your adoption The Good Seed quality that dropped in the good ground of your soul has got the capacity to fight the shadows in the cycle and come to the Harvest as a quality SE Church Without amen praise the Lord yes sir do you get that do you have faith for that you are a son of God he didn't call you to lose you amen listen here when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of the life within it to trans it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it will be are you together with me you are going to be what God Said you anything other than that understanding is the devil throwing you in the shadow but let the light say I going to be a St of a perf because he put the potentials he put the life in the sea to receive the word accept the word on the word amen praise God and as long as said in the right [Music] category it will just exactly be what God Said would be it to be that way because he had come in that way and made a Chanel that anything that stays in his channel in line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move away from it's a channel just exactly right so with everything in the trust in his own son that it would be that way then God said it's all good so I'll just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the space that I desire it to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in it potential now to make out of exactly what I want it to be hallelujah hallelujah God has put enough potential in your SE to overcome the ADV of the journey to overcome all the shadows in the cycle he didn't say that the trials won't come he the won't come he he has put the power in the seed everything that come amen just confess tell your brother man over amen that's the way God Made You and Omega is the same I am he never says anything in between in between battles hallelujah hallelujah when God called Joseph he didn't tell him about the battles he told him about the moment of Glory how the sun will bow how the STS will bow the will B how the sh will B he didn't tell him about the pit he didn't tell him about the prison hallelujah hallelujah so he tells us about that Eternal Trials Come God knows how to deal with he knows how to deal with it in between here he says nothing in between here there are trials and he says I know your I know your trials I know your Temptations I know your poverty he knows everything but at the end here he told you about a glorious body that will come at the change of our body it tells us about a kingdom amen praise God do you love him yes sir I want you know that in between here there are trials you wake up in bad days but there is a coming Kingdom he will help you to overcome amen remember in the preview of the Bride the prophet he sees the bride in the perfect condition completely perfect but in the shadows in the ccle in the seven churches he begins to see the condition that the pride was going to fight and he were so desperate he says with all the preaching is this the best we can and God told him the preview of the Bride will come again and at the end of it and the were the same hallelujah hallelujah the Alpha and the Omega were the same the first preview represented the last preview amen praise the Lord so let me finish here by going back to Genesis 8 verse 22 where he says while the Earth remain seed time and harvest and cold and heat and some and winter and day and night shall not see so we shall you know understand this by The Perennial trees they know how to enter into that moment of trial they know that seed I mean they know that hot and cold will be there winter and summer will be there tells them he has put an intelligence in the SE there is an intelligence Divine intelligence in the SE the side of Amen you are made in such a way that you beat all the Shadows of the cycle and come to the harest as a St of a perfect the prophet says did you ever notice a tree it will put forth it leaf and then it serves its time through the summer way before the frost Falls that LE begins to turn yellow redown after it drops off of the tree falls down it's the end of it no what happens the life that was in that leaf goes back to the root of the tree where it comes from what does it do then of the year it brings forth with it a resurrection a new same life returning back with a new this looks like never start again but it fights the in the valley of trial and finally comes back again and the tree goes back and back again and the prophet says I don't have confidence in a man who falls and never Rises he gets into a situation and never gets out of it I don't have confidence in nature teaches us that you can Rise Again amen yes sir so look at him here I'm just finishing friends be be patient a little revelation 22 I jesus I've sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David the bright and Morning Star is in the root and is also up here the same life and when the same life again is put back into the ground it does the same he was before David he was inav and he says I am Alpha and Omega he was before David he was durav after he works with us in the beginning even where he says nothing it is still God the the take us through the without we cannot make it amen oh yes sir he says I am the life that lives through the seasons and that seed gen that will beat the seasons in the cycle to bring forth the St of a perfect has got the potential in it already he says I am the root and spirit I am the Jan S Stone I'm Reuben all the way to Benjamin the same life keeps going through are you together with me so I want tell you here that when the seed falls in the ground of your heart amen it's Eternal right it's eternal justification sanctification B of the Holy Ghost is the same life that started in the sea and goes with you all the way to the Harvest amen he justifies you to teach you so that you become a clean house for him to dwell in amen being confident of this very thing that he which began a good work in you will perform it to the day of Jesus Christ he started a good work he perform it the of Jesus Christ when you feel like you are in the shadow lift up your heart when John felt like was in a shadow on the island of P then God and he says I am Alpha and Omega I be a good work which I'll finish am it doesn't matter what situation you walk through will be there with you amen so the way he deals with us is in a order to the human methods regardless of the shadows and the changing of the seasons we start from the winning sight did you hear that regardless of all the trials you are going to overcome God sees you as an overcomer amen so I want you to know that God knows how to deal with us Joseph was given the precious promises but along the way God did not tell him about the hatred of the Brethren he did not tell him about the pit he did not tell him about the prison he only says I'm Al I'm he that starts a good work and I'm he that finishes the work my trials he put the Potentials in Joseph to overcome the pit pron amen praise the Lord yes sir there's too much God bless you God bless you do you love him amen the shadows in the 23 started with you he will bring you back into the ship for God bless you God bless let's stand I love you because he first he couldn't call you unless he was going to take you the way through he didn't tell you about what you are going through but it's he only told Joseph that all the Sun the moon and the stars will bow if he told him of the trials it would have broken his fath [Music] but even in the trials he put the potentials for us to overcome you love I love I love isus love he loved you CH my come [Music] precious Heavenly Father we come before youday to Thank You Lord because you loved us from the beginning you promised us Victory but in between here you hid us the moments of Shadows but here Lord we believe that even in between you
