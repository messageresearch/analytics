your Bibles we want to invite you in the scripture to the Book of John the 18th chapter to the Book of John the 18th chapter and while you're turning there tonight we do want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we sure count it an honor and a privilege to be here with you once again and and then sure appreciate brother Matt for the opportunity to come and visit you once again and speak to you from the message of the hour anden just coming out of the meetings there in Louisiana this weekend and many of you all were there with us and my wasn't that a wonderful time in the presence of God amen amen the spirit of the Lord just moving Among Us and doing Supernatural things and amen I believe he's right here tonight to do it again amen amen St John the 18th chapter and the 37th verse the Bible here says pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then and Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world now watch this that I should bear witness of the truth and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice the pilate saith unto him what is truth that's a that's a little question but it's a big question what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and sath unto them I find no I find in him no fault at all so right there Christ was pronounced Innocent but ye have ACC custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover will you therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews and they cried they all again saying not this man but barabus so they didn't want the word they wanted a robber because the Bible said now barabus was a robber so they turned down truth and accepted a robber amen we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon amen we want you by the help of the Lord tonight just to take a few moments here and if I title this tonight I want to speak to you on opportunities presented by the message of the hour amen opportunities presented by the message of the hour when you look at this word opportunity it is a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something it is a chance for success or advancement occurs so when there is an opportunity something has been put together something has been planned out something has been fixed so that you could actually move forward or you could Advance now I love what the prophet of God says in the Easter seal 65 he said oh Christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of having we have opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and all them never had amen the opportunities that we have now amen these opportunities are not in the future and they're not in the past but these opportunities are actually present tense now the Bible says in 1 John 3 and verse one behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God see therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not so here he men is the Lord speaking through John declaring amen that the world did not know the Lord so they're not going to know the sons of the Lord amen but he says beloved now are we the sons of God so this is not in the future that we're going to be the sons of God but right now amen we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him amen for we shall see him as he is now I want to say this tonight thank God amen for sending us a Vindicated Prophet messenger amen with the absolute message amen that would bring us to a complete identification amen that we are the sons of God see amen we're not just partially identified as the children of God Amen when we feel good or when we're at camp or when we're in a meeting but as the message of the hour has been laid across this generation we have come to a complete identity amen that we are sons of God Amen and we are believers now I'm just drawn some inspiration from a quote in power of transformation brother says we are now ready for a battle how many's ready for the battle amen the trumpet is to sound the hymns have been sang he said and now comes the word but to hear these comments amen of these young soldiers here he said myself getting old and listen around and your faith and confidence and what you have placed in to believe the message that I have been given of God now if it wasn't for you all amen the message would do no good now amen let's not just leave this all the way back in 1965 amen but let's bring it right here tonight if it wasn't for you all amen the message would do no good see it's got to be somebody Amen to believe it see and as long as it's coming from God Amen there's going to be somebody believe it you see because God has made a way he has affixed his great economy like that that when he sends forth something there is something there Amen to meet that something see in other words God had arranged to send a message in the last days amen but he did not send it hoping somebody amen would show up to believe it but when God sent this message amen through the forn knowledge of God he knew amen that you would be here amen and when the message arrived you would arrive amen listen there is not a chance that you're going to miss this message there is not a chance you're going to miss this Rapture amen God has so fix this thing amen that when he begins to sound there will be somebody on the earth to believe what he is hand amen the Deep will respond to the call of the deep he said see it's got to be that way an't that beautiful however God fixes something it cannot be another way it's got to be the exact way that God has a fixed for it to be and I say this if we are here and I believe we are then God has sent this message and it must be received as Divine in 1 Thessalonians 213 the Bible said this cause also amen we thank god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but watch what Paul says but as it is in the truth amen as it is in truth the word of God Amen which effectually worketh also in you amen that figure everything out amen and you that reason everything out and you that memorizes everything no my Bible says the word of God worketh effectually Amen in you that believe see the prophet of God said we must receive amen and believe the the message let me say this we must believe it and we must receive it at the same degree or the same level that it was sent in amen and I want to say this it was not delivered casually it was not delivered half-heartedly it was not delivered Luke horley amen but this message was delivered with passion amen let me say this the prophet of God taed it to Rahab amen receiving her message and he said when Rahab received that message she received it with urgency amen and she went out there and went to work amen to get everybody under the token amen that Joshua had provided and the prophet of God brings it to the Token in our day and says oh God let us open up our hearts and receive the message that Jesus is Alive tonight he is right here Among Us he is the same yesterday today and forever amen open up your house and let the messenger the Holy Ghost come in and identify You by his own presence amen the token that's upon you then you don't have to take no nobody else's word for it amen he is here to speak for himself amen and he here is the word amen can I say this we're not gathered here tonight amen taking what somebody said about this message we're not gathered here taking what somebody thinks about this message amen but we are a part of the economy of God and God has fixed it in this generation that we will stand here tonight as Witnesses amen that God is a savior that God Is A Healer that God is a miracle worker that God is a wa maker God is a restorer God is a Soul Saver listen there's no mountain too big enough there's no Valley too wide there's no trial too hard amen but what this message amen cannot come into your heart and identify this is the return amen of the Vindicated presence of almighty God Amen I love how the prophet delivers this message he was not he was not wondering he was convinced Amen brother Brandon was convinced amen that his message was of God Amen and it was from God Amen how many agrees the message was of God Amen and the message was from God he said I am thoroughly convinced that my message comes from God I am thoroughly convinced it's not my own fleshly mind puffed up it's the word of God I am thoroughly convinced absolutely convinced that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I am thoroughly convinced that he's here right now another place he said truly friends I believe with all my heart with all my faith I believe that my message comes from God power to transform he said now that's what we're here for amen that's my message has been all along amen is the word of God then we must hold on to that amen regardless of others things takes place amen always stay with that word I love this one he said I'm so thankful to have a people like you amen what would my message be if I had nobody that believed it he said but there is a people here amen that you would die for it amen for this message we got he said may God help each one of you and may you not forget that you're a part in that Resurrection amen the quickening power is now in you amen it's all settled amen you are God's child amen before a prophet walked off the scene amen he settled the question amen of whether you are a child of God or not he said the quickening power is already in you amen you are already a part of this resur Direction hey the devil can do whatever he wants to this body amen but he cannot destroy the soul amen cuz the soul has already passed amen from Death un life amen I want to put hell on notice tonight amen I am a holy ghost fill fire baptized Malachi for following Pillar of Fire anointed son of the Living God it don't matter what Devil Comes our way we're going to throw up our hands and praise God it don't matter what trials and what situations amen we are here amen for the cuse of the message of the hour we know where we come from we know where we're standing and we know where we're going yeah we have bad days yeah we have dry spelles but when the dust settles and the Smoke Clears we are still a part of the Lamb's Book of Life and there ain't enough devils in hell to remove our names from the identification that was spoken by the word of God hey we didn't come here to play games we come here as word born Believers hey the quickening power is now in you you it's all settled you're God's child look at somebody and say it's settled you belong to God it's settled you belong to God David Paul it's settled you belong to God don't matter what the devil says you belong to God it don't matter what the devil says brother Vernon we've had a word Prophet who has said it's settled you belong to God listen if I was here questioning whether he was convinced or not but when he said that he was convinced that what he was saying was coming from God and I am convinced to believe that what he was saying was coming from God and if it was good enough for him to say it's good enough for us to believe and defeat every devil of confusion defeat every devil of negativity defeat every devil of depression come on church amen a prophet spoke over you and said quickening power is already in you now when God sends a message the prophet tells us there's three things that God gives when he speaks to a man now I believe that according to Hebrews one amen that God still speaks can we all agree that God Amen still speaks God who at sunright times and diverse men are spake in times past under the fathers by the prophets man it's a bad night for the devil to be here amen spoke by the prophets amen hath in these last days spoken unto us amen by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world now I want you to look at this word spoken it means to use words in order to declare one's mind and to disclose one thoughts so when somebody begins to speak they're not just pulling things out of midair but there's something in their mind that they're using their voice Amen to declare what's in their mind in other words amen God sent a prophet in this generation Amen to declare what was on the back part of God's mind listen we are not feeding on the mind of a man we are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man listen church that's why we can say Amen when we feel lower than a snake's belly that's why we can believe the promises of God when the devil Stacks all kinds of things on us amen because we come amen from the back part of God's mind and God sent a prophet in this generation to identify your origin and to identify you as a part of God hey hey I belong to God I don't belong to depression I don't belong to negativity I don't belong to sin I don't belong to ungodliness I belong to God and there ain't enough devils in Hell Amen to steal me from who I belong to when God speaks to a man he gives him a purpose when God speaks to a man he gives him ambition when God speaks to a man he gives him Faith to do it amen to accomplish or to achieve what his purpose in life is see what God called him to do he has called us to be in the Church of God when God called you to be a part of this church he gave you a purpose for being in this church he give you an ambition for being in this church and he give you Faith Amen to accomplish the purpose that he brought you in this church to fulfill let me just say this there's not one member of this church that is a waste of time there's not one member in this church that is lower than somebody else amen we are all sinners amen saved by the grace of God filled with the Holy Ghost washed in the blood of God listen amen I think it's time to remember amen we didn't buy our way in we didn't politic our way in we didn't earn our way in amen but the grace of God reached down and picked us up and give us a position in the economy of God hey he put us here to believe the message listen well I'm just a little housewife amen will be a holy ghost fi amen fire baptized devil stomping housewife but I'm just a young person will be a holy ghost filled fire baptized amen young person a part of Grace Tabernacle it'll draw the sword of the Lord come on young people you've got purpose you've got ambition and the faith of God is upon your life to fulfill the purpose of God when God speaks amen when God speaks can I say this it's the truth when God speaks he speaks the truth I love John 18:37 amen I don't have time to break all of it down but from the Amplified Bible he said so pilate said to him amen then you are a king and Jesus answered you say correctly that I am a king this is why I was born for this for this have I come into the world to testify to the truth so Jesus is standing before the man who is getting ready to put him on the cross so to speak amen and he's not lost his confession in the face of iniquity in the face come on amen amen they they they they accused him without anything to prove it by but he still stood there upon this confession that the reason I came into this Earth the whole reason I'm here is to testify to the truth everyone who is of the truth amen I love how this breaks it down everyone who is of the truth who is a friend of the truth and belongs to the truth amen hears and listens carefully to my voice now look at this word born it is of men who father children it is to be born to be begotten amen of a wom of a woman giving birth to Children brother said recently Lord upon the basis of Thy word and the Holy Spirit we are so glad to know where our birth comes from he said you have got to be born the will of God Amen not the will of man am the will of Flesh amen but will of God to be saved so here is Jesus the word right amen standing in the face of pilot amen and he looks at pilate and says I have come into this world Amen to do one thing and that is to testify of the truth can I say this Jesus's trial amen of his death could not back him off of his purpose of being here and the Bible said the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory and So Glorious the only begotten of the father love this brother Joe amen full of grace and truth amen when Jesus was standing before pilot if pilot could only recognize amen who was standing in front of him amen was the word made flesh and he was full of grace and he was full of Truth oh God have mercy amen pilate was standing in the presence of Pardon he was standing in the presence of the one amen that could say one word and remove everything over his life amen but for this PA he had come into the world Amen and he stood there in his position against opposition and said I've come from God and I must go back to God I love this amen the people of God are of the truth the people of God are a friend of the truth hey can I say this and the people of God belongs to the truth that's why the devil can't get you is because he is the father of Lies but you are the children of truth that's why lies don't stop you that's why lies don't confuse you that's why lies don't back you up and take away your praise and steal your joy and silence your song Amen but you know who you are by the confidence of God hey well glory to God I come from truth that's why I'm free is because I am a friend of truth I belong to truth I love what the pr of God says he said the Holy Ghost dispensation come in and continued on and will continue on by by the administration of angels to the church truly but they're ordained spirits of God they're sent from God to carry the things out every man was a special calling amen back All Through the Ages amen angels has visit men amen it's not a worship of angels like Brigham Young and so forth I love this but an angel of God Amen will testify to the truth of God if the angel comes from God he will testify to the truth of God that's right amen and will declare God so when the angel of God comes into the church he's going to testify of God he's going to declare God it won't have some kind of mythical something that no one understands hey we ought to take a minute put our shouting shoes on that we're not under a confused denomination we're not under a confused Bishop we're not under a confused Pope amen we're under the leadership of the angel of God and when he comes in the church he don't bring confusion he rebukes confusion when he comes in the church he don't bring Str glory to God when he comes in the church here's what the prophet of God says it'll speak of Jesus Christ he will testify of Jesus Christ and will produce Jesus Christ to the people I am thoroughly convinced that the message of the hour came from the angel of God through the seventh angel see Jesus knew that he was born of the will of God he knew he was born to save man amen and Satan tried to defeat that purpose amen through Pontius pilot amen by the Judgment that he passed on the case of Jesus Christ listen friends when pil oh God when pilate passed judgment and said he is guilty amen crucify him amen listen he didn't realize that he was passing judgment upon him but the Judgment he was receiving was going to take the Judgment amen off of everyone who was a friend of Truth who was born of Truth who belonged to the truth well glory to God Amen you may feel down and out tonight amen but I think it's high time to remember who you are you are a part of Truth you belong to truth amen then say what the truth says and the truth says you're saved the truth says you're healed the truth says you're free the truth says you never done it in the first place the truth says you got the Holy Ghost the truth says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world come on children of Truth come on Friends of Truth amen change your confession amen from the confession of pilate Amen to the confession of Jesus and say what he said about you one time now listen what the prodag God said it was at the time of the crucifixion of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he had done nothing as they could find in him and he had answered everything it was just the hour it had to be that way it was just the hour it had to be that way that's the reason this had to happen to the greatest man that ever lived on earth or ever could live amen the reason reason it happened this way is because it was time for it to happen see it must be thus and there was no way to escape it think about that that God in his economy had so fixed that moment that pilate would stand there and say I find no fault in him he would send him brother called it pilot scheme he would send him to Herod and then he would come back amen and say I still find no fault in this man but God had fixed it that way so that he would be standing there at that hour he said Jesus had come to the Earth exactly the way that God's word had predicted he would come he did just exactly what the word said he would do he lived the life just exactly and God made known or manifested amen the seed of that time now can I say this amen God's purpose in sending Jesus amen was for the purpose of bringing reality into Humanity brother said God is a god of reality is he not not don't just take a Creed don't just take a sensation take a reality take a real God something that God is amen a god of reality that gives you Assurance it gives you hope it gives you faith it gives you the spirit it gives you signs it gives you wonders it does in you just like it did in Christ because that was his purpose of coming Amen to bring God to man and made God and man one can I say this how many wants to know what your purpose is on the earth you want to know what your purpose is can I tell you what a prophet said he said we are born to believe the word of God we are born to believe Jesus Christ come on church we are born to believe the one who stood before pilot in the face of his death and said I've come for one purpose and that is the purpose of Truth and God has arranged things to send a message in this generation as an announcement that truth has returned in the middle of an age of deception can I say this to you we are born to believe the message can I say this there's something in you and can I say this what's in you says the message is real that's why you're believing what you're believing because things around you will question it things around you amen will make you wonder but if there is a gene seed of God on the inside of your soul then there is something in you that causes your soul to agree with this word I say thank God we have returned to a Vindicated definition of what the message of the hour is can I say this it's God's promise of this hour anybody anybody ever heard the term message of the hour sure you have amen can I tell you what a prophet said it is he said it's God's promise for the hour you're living in so don't ever wonder no more amen what is the message don't ever wonder no more amen I wish I could figure out the message I have just told you what the angel of God said to a prophet the message of the hour is God's promise of the hour you're living in can I say this amen that definition did not come out of Bob Jones University that definition amen did not come out of a commentary amen but according to a prophet he said sister Joyce I've got to stay under the anointing Amen to find what the message of the hour is so he was living under the anointing and coming to the pullit and telling the church this is what the message is it's not what it was and it's not what it's going to be he said here's what the message is that Jesus Christ is truly risen from the dead glory to God now can I just preach here for a minute because the Bible said amen that the Yoke shall be destroyed amen because of the anointing a prophet of God said I stay under the anointing Amen to find out what the message is so when he comes out amen he's preaching under the anointing and that anointing is a yoke destroy an anointing in other words when that anointing begins to move in a church it begins to bring an opportunity among the people Amen to receive the truth or to reject the truth and if you reject the truth you will leave the same way you came in worse but if you will receive the truth you will not leave here like you came H glory to God I feel like shouting on that one we don't have to leave the same way we came we don't have to come in bad and leave worse we don't have to come in down and leave lower amen there is a message of the king that has come in the camp and it's a message of Deliverance it's a message of Mercy it's a message of Grace it's a message of faith and if you can receive it as the truth it'll destroy the Yoke over your life it'll destroy the Yol over your home and the presence of God will'll walk back in that home and will identify itself as the token of God but I feel like shouting tonight hey I ain't going to leave here like I came I ain't going to leave here like I came and neither are you will you sing that song you ain't going to leave here like you came in Jesus name brother God said it he said the message of the hour is repent and turn back again to the faith of the father turn back again to the faith of the one you was begotten of turn back again to the faith of the one you belong to turn back again to the face of the one that you're a friend of come on Amen can I preach Matt amen you might have walked in here holding the devil's hand and everything the devil is saying is contrary to what your father says but why don't you tonight let the anointing amen sever the handshake between you and the devil and come back to The Winning Side come back to the side of the father and say I refuse I refuse I refuse I refuse I refuse to believe what the devil says I belong to truth I'm going to say what truth says I'm not a failure I'm an overcomer I'm not an accident I've got a purpose I'm not hopeless I'm full of the hope of Jesus Christ I'm not going to hell I'm going to Glory I'm not sick I'm well I'm not bound I'm free I'm not lost I've been found I'm not hopeless helpless and homeless I have a father who died on the cross at Calvary to give me a home in glory the message of the hour is return back to the word turn back to where you come from turn back to your father now can I just say what the Propet of God said direct quote we're not come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message and the message is Christ you ready for this he is the word can I can I give another devil a black eye you no longer have to wonder what you're a part of you're not a part of a click you're not a part of a church anty you're not a part of a church Society come on church amen am I might as well preach I'm here amen young people amen every church I don't know it's just here I'm going preach amen every church is Sovereign in itself there's not one church that everybody follows there's not one church and people say well amen I'm a part of the greatest church and we have a right Amen to believe those things Amen in our human selves you got a right to take pride Amen in your church but don't you ever get this in your mind amen that there's one Church better than another so we got to change things in this church to do the way they do it there or we all need to go there amen that is a carnal comparison devil amen from the pits of Hell amen God don't want ever Church like Grace Tabernacle and neither does he want ever Church like even light or fi Tabernacle or any other church amen he's the god of the church he's the god of the church in Arkansas he's the god of the church in Virginia he's the god of the church in Louisiana amen and I'll say this we have been given a message and it's the inside it's the headship to every church I say get back in the message until the word of God ask the preeminence among your life again we ain't trying to dress like so and so and sing like so and so and Shout like so and so we are in the message we shout like the message message we sing like the message we praise like the message we worship like the message we break out and dance like the message because we're part of the [Applause] truth away with carnal comparisons and back to the sovereignty of the local church molding the character of Jesus Christ into every member get in the message the message is Christ he is the word that's that's right where to get beneath it to get into it to get beneath it well glory to God so when you get into something and you get beneath something it becomes your headship I might as well preach I'm this close to it we don't belong to no Bishops we don't belong to no popes we don't belong to no moves we belong to truth and what we say is cause the cause we sin in this earth Brother Kyle amen is for the cause of Truth Listen I cannot apologize for truth well we might as well preach amen amen when the man of God gets to preaching against sin amen he can't apologize because he belongs to truth amen Matt don't walk out of his office amen holding the hand of Lucifer and walk up here and be a politician and Pat ever devil on the back but he's holding hands with the father of truth because he was born of truth and the only thing you can preach is the truth come on gra Tabernacle you ought to get back to shouting and thanking God Amen cuz you got somebody that'll stand in the puppet and will preach the truth in the face of every devil in the face of every negative Spirit he'll stand there and say you shall know the truth Grace Tabernacle and the truth shall make you free El somebody shout thank God for the truth thank God for the message amen amen give me some Elbow Room thank God for the truth thank God for the message thank God for the seventh angel thank God for the sovereignty of the local church now Faith well devil I'm going to preach it you can mess the iPad up all you want to Faith is a revelation of the will of God now you all know amen the pr of God said it like this he says faith is a revelation from God of the will of God you only got it by the grace of God that's the real revelation amen that God keeps his word now can I say this the only way you will take the Rapture is by the truth so quit looking for anything apart from truth come on now amen I hear guys get up and preach and say all kinds of things and I can't say Amen to it cuz I have no earthly idea where it come from well I read this book and I heard this guy amen well God bless them guys but we belong to truth we're not going to take a Rapture by com dictionaries we're not going to take a Rapture by coma denominational ideas we have been given a wheat seed message and it's the truth and if we're going to take a rapture we got to get into it and we got to get beneath it brother B said like this the Rapture is a revelation to her he said see the bride of Christ will be waiting amen for the Rapture Revelation can I say this we have it now you say this brother Andrew yes I'm going to remember it's not rapturing works it's rapturing Grace and rapturing Faith you will not work your way in this Rapture you will not shout your way in this Rapture you will not dance your way in this rap you'll do some dancing on the way but that's not the only way you're going to get there are you hearing me the way you will get in this Rapture is the same way you come back into your complete identification as a son of Truth for by grace are ye saved amen through faith it is not of yourselves amen it is the gift of God I truly believe before the church can have the Rapture somebody say it's got to have it's got to have rapturing faith then can I say this what God requires amen God must provide what God requires God must provide brother if God is requiring something brother Travis than God has got to provide it I use this example amen down the camp it's okay to use it here amen I used on brother Ron use on you Matt amen amen if I call Matt up and I say now Matt let's go to Colorado and let's go on an Lunt amen now let's go I'm inviting you let's go come on Amen and I show up at this house and I say if you got gas money have you got a have you got money to buy a hotel can you buy me some tags and buy me some tickets and buy some food amen before long Matt's going to say what in the world have I been invited on Amen I thought I was invited to go somewhere amen and I called Matt and I said Matt it's a gift I want to take it but then I show up and he's got to provide everything to get us there listen amen that's unfair he is no longer going as a gift he's trying to work his way on the trip are you hearing me amen and God cannot require rapturing faith and then say go pray 10 times a day go fast 10 times today join this church do this no if God requires it amen when God invites you on the trip it's already paid for and Church of the Living God we ain't trying to work up enough Grace we ain't trying to work up enough faith Ben God invited us in this Rapture he invited us to be a part of the church of living God listen whatever we have need of he is the inexhaustible Fountain he has the unsearchable riches all we got to do is drink in and push out everything we have need of is in this message now the pr of God makes it very beautiful right down the road from here in Jonesburg Arkansas he says now we're able to pull the pages back but we're not able to open the word Thou Art the only one who can take this word and th art the only one that's worthy to open the word the lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world oh Lamb of God oh Lamb of God come into our midst tonight in the power of thy resurrection and give us rapturing Faith now I'm not a crazy man I'm a message preacher that studies the message and nowhere in there did Brother BR say these words let Miracles be done tonight and give rapturing faith rapturing Faith does not come for miracles they had miracles in Pentecost rapturing faith comes from the opening of the word see and the opening of the word is what moves this bride from a lay out ofan age into a bride age now can I say what the pr of God said all the way back in 1954 he's already talking about how many you heard the term Bri age honestly let me see your hands you've heard it right amen amen so there's no confusion in 1954 he does not term at Bri age till 65 but in 1954 he's already talking about it he said now we're moving right on into another great age see coming for the Rapture of the church and in this we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts so we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts but see it stumbled many big fine churches it sent the Nazarene backwards it made Fanatics out of a lot of Pentecost but just the same God is moving right on Amen bringing in rapturing faith for his church so God was not allowing what was stumbling one generation to hinder the Next Generation but because God is rich in Mercy he provided a way Amen to move on from The Stumbling and to move into the reality can I say this I love how brother B says this he said one place he says we got to have rapturing faith I love what he says but don't worry it'll be there can we relax Our Minds tonight we're going to leave here one of these mornings we're going to leave here one of these mornings amen now come on Church Brother David one of these mornings there's going to come a cool sweep a I'm I'm not a crazy man there's going to come a cool sweep amen I don't know amen it might even happen in the morning and you look up and there's your there's your loved ones behind you amen and they step out of Eternity and they take you by the hand and they lead you back into eternity are you hearing me I'm not a crazy man I'm not looking for the restoration of gifts I've seen the restoration of guest I'm looking for the changing of my body some morning between 6:00 and 9 come on church on the morning the Rapture can I say this amen sister we ain't going to get down and say oh God have I got Rapture in faith oh god brother Kobe have I got Rapture in faith I got to get it I got to have it on the morning the Rapture don't worry it'll be there I wish I was a preacher right now to make this as plain as this are you hearing me don't worry it's going to be there you ain't going to have to get up and wonder and check look and hunt and find come on it's here Rapture and faith is in this church Grace Tabernacle Release Yourself to the message of the hour it's the power of God to change your body in the moment in the twinking of an eye you ain't working yourself up into it it's already in you Jared it's already in you and one of these mornings it's going to give way and that jeans stat on the inside of your soul is going to burst the bars of bone and this soul is is going to go meet the theophany and in the moment the twinking of an eye death is going to be swallowed up and the grave is going to be defeated and victory and victory and victory is going to rain on every person I'm not a crazy man I've already got rapturing faith I've already got rapturing Grace brother John it's already in me it's why I'm here I ain't gonna get done but I'll be back in a few days are you hearing me amen it's already in me it's already in me come on church it's already in you that's why you get out of bed Sarah it's already in you that's why you face another day church it's already in you you know what the part of God called it he called it quickening power he said me a 56 year old man he said I wake up in the morning and I don't feel like getting out of bed he said but something goes to moving he said what is it oh it's that quickening power he said it goes to turning and it gets me up out of bed come on church I need that quickening power to get out of bed I needed to make it through the day I needed to change my body and it's already here it's already in you now we're not looking for it it's already working see that's what's moving in this building tonight come on and we're not beating drums to work it up we're not Str I'm in a hot goodar to get it moving we're not banging on a piano to get somebody to child but the word is working effectually in the Church of the Living God you know why because it's the truth brother Joe it's the truth listen but oh God it's more true than your feelings it's more true than your emotions it's more true than your sensation may I say this the same Jesus that stood before Pilate and said it is the truth is the same Jesus in this building tonight in the form of his word by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's telling you Vana it's the truth it's the truth church I don't care what it looks like I don't care what it feels like I don't care what the devil says it's the truth and somebody ought to testify it's the truth I've already got rapturing faith I've already got rapturing Grace I've already got the Holy Ghost the word's already in my soul it's the truth it's the truth it's the truth it's the truth I wish I could shout it on the top of the roof tonight it's the truth Mark the message of the hour is the truth get in it get beneath it it's the truth now Revelation 10 says it very beautiful ream picks this up and this is the sign of the end sir he said the other Angels was Messengers they were men of the Earth but this angel said to the angel of the Church of Leota now watch this one didn't come from the Earth he come down from heaven see because the mystery is all finished when the mystery is finished the angel said time shall be no more then seven Thunders thr out their voices what if it is something to let us know how to enter into the rapturing faith see accepting the Vindicated word is God's provided way to bring the believer in the rapturing faith can I say this accepting what God has revealed and opened in your generation is the path to fulfill the promise of the hour you're living in now if we could look at Revelation 101 and remember what the prophet of God said he said we're not talking about the message we're getting in it Brother David you've been around for a while you've been in some of those meetings where all they do is talk about the message come on some of you Elders know what I'm talking about two hours they just stand there and talk about it and talk about it and talk about it hello and debate it and compare it and compare this quo with that quo amen and all they're doing is talking about it and their young people's waiting on them to get done so they can go somewhere and have some fun cuz I don't think this quote goes with that quote and I don't think this idea lines with that idea and what do you think about so they're sitting around the message comparing it but that's not what the proud of God said he said we're to get in it we are to get beneath it now Revelation 10:1 says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven cloth with a cloud now a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire do you know there's people that actually claim to believe this message that say the cloud is irrelevant they actually say the cloud is irrelevant they say things like well we really don't even need the cloud well okay tear out Revelation 10:1 and throw it away then but if you do that oh God I feel that Spirit if you do that you've just removed William brandom from being a word Prophet because a word Prophet has to testify of the whole truth and nothing but the truth and from Genesis to Revelation he said everything is the truth see that's why the devil hates this church is we don't have to tear out one scripture to have a good meeting we don't have to get up here behind the pull pit and turn a page and move a page and remove a quote to have church we can say every scripture we can read every quote we can shout on everything we can shout on every promise we can take correction we can take blessings we can take anointing we can take Revelation because we belong to truth so they say well this is not very important but I want to say this if you can give me that first picture Amen in 1963 amen this appeared in the skies it showed up above the Earth it did not come from the earth it it came from the heavens now listen they had this picture and there was men looking at it and they were seeing Angels they were seeing prophets they were seeing all kinds of figures but in 1965 and it is the rising of the Sun the pro God said well if you'll turn the picture like this and look and he turns the picture and he says you can probably see it from the audience it's Christ you can turn the picture come on Church you know what I love about that is he didn't just say I can see it from the pull pit he said but you can see it from the audience you know what that tells me the youngest of our babies can see it the oldest of our elders can see it it ain't just a bunch of preachers seeing it it ain't just a bunch of Decon sent amen but every word born believer Who belongs to truth and is a friend of Truth can see it is no one else but the Lord Jesus Christ descending into this generation as the father of light glory to God hallelujah amen I feel like shouting out of the building on that one amen our youngest the children can see it our youngest the babies can see it amen what can they see they don't see a man man they see Jesus Christ they don't see a prophet they see the face of the son of man who is coming in glory and clouds and great power and it's going to change our bodies well somebody put your shouting shoes on you know why cuz that's your daddy that's your father that's your dad you belong to him you're a friend of his you go where he goes you say what he says you do what he does you belong to truth Hallelujah do you see it it's Christ one place brother Maddie says it like this oh it's our Lord up there it's Christ see his eyes looking here just as it could be we in the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see his nose can you see his mouth I love this brother Matt it don't say brother B says amen it says congregation says oh god brother Veron so it's not just a prophet saying it oh God it's not just a prophet saying it but the entire congregation is saying I see it I see it I see it come on church amen amen pilot saw the same thing and he said crucified but there's a bride on on the earth tonight who's looking at the same thing and she's saying that's our Lord holy worthy honor power Majesty is due unto his name listen Grace Tabernacle we didn't come in here to crucify him we come in here to worship him we come in here to praise him he's the Lord he's the king of kings he's the Lord of lords he's the God that was he's the god that is he's the god which shall forever more be and the greatest thing about it is he is my God and I believe belong to him and he belongs to [Applause] me just turn the picture he says from this I love how he says this brother man from this the way they had it to this way the way it's supposed to be tired this message being legalism change it from the way they had it to this way the way it's supposed to be and it'll be a Revival on Wednesday night woo Glory change the picture and the campfire won't just burn in Oklahoma it won't just burn in Louisiana but it'll burn on a Wednesday night it'll burn on a Sunday morning it's the truth [Applause] friends that's right he is supreme judge there is none other but him see are you ready for this it's a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth this is the truth it is true brother said making him not a third person but the only person oh God wish I was out in the field right now I'd probably Shout with that cow are y'all hearing me it's the truth it's not a third person it's not a second person it's not a preacher it's not a b look it's not a tape it's the reality of Truth this hallelujah it's the truth Mark it's the truth listen what a prophet of God said he said with a white you see the dark in his face his beard his eyes notice from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to ready for this and on the cross that's where he looked to the right where he pardoned The Sinner Brother David Paul I get on that page when he looked to the right he parred in the center come on church he was not looking to the left he was not looking above him he was looking for the people come on church he knew that a prophet of God was going to walk in this generation and preach a sermon called what shall I do with this Jesus called Christ and say we're in another pilot Hall when he hung there in Arizona he knew that was going to happen but he also knew he was going to fix it so much that when he hung on the cross and he looked to the right he was going to pardon the people who would raise their hand on Wednesday April the 3D and say it's the truth Lord I believe it Lord I believe the message I believe it above my feelings I believe it above my problems it's the truth now come on brother said when he turned to the right he pardoned the center he said but in the light of Resurrection in the light of his resurrection he says we still go forth in his name now I want to close on this point so here what you see there comes down but in Revelation 10 to and he had in his hand a little book closed is that what your Bible says he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth now Revelation 5 that book was closed Brother David but in Revelation 10 that book was open and the prodag God said he cried with a loud voice as when a Lon Roth and when he had cried s seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write but I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not now people say well the seven Thunders are still closed okay I'll go with you on that so you're a bound Church don't tell me the seven Thunders are closed and got freedom because whatever was in those seven Thunders come on Amen if you get time this week if you I wish had time to go through all of it but let me say it like this the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols right from the first chapter to the 22nd chapter it's a book of symbols you constantly are reading symbol symbol symbol symbol symbol listen and as long as it's in symbol form any old body can walk up here and say well this is that symbol and that's that symbol and that's that symbol and you know what happens amen it brings a confusion because somebody else walks up and says no this is that symbol and that's that symbol oh I'm getting into it now and that's that symbol amen but you know what a prophet of God did he cleaned up the y'all remember he cleaned up the air in the church and revealed the symbols so we're no longer reading symbols we're reading the reality of those symbols come on church I'm no longer reading just saying a lamb and Thunders and trumpets come on church when he comes down confusion goes out when the seventh angel comes down with the open book receed from the mighty Angel confusion goes out now I believe that through those seven Thunders we'll be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith there's something we got to step further we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out of this Earth and we'll find after a while the Lord will and find where it's written we don't know where at yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away I love brother BR I love brother BR English and when it do look at somebody saying when it do a joke when it do it'll give faith for that rapturing Grace for that church to move out see we just move through everything we know of through all that this ens ation we've watched everything we've seen the Mysteries we've seen the appearing of the great grren together the bride in the last days but yet there's something in there we just can't lighten oursel with there's something other but I imagine when them Mysteries begins to come forth God said hold it back now wait a minute I'll reveal it in that day don't Rite it at all John cause they'll stagger over it just let it go but I'll reveal it in that day when it has need to be done can I say this you are the need need to reveal the seven Thunders you are the need to reveal the symbols of the Book of Revelation Church of the Living God you are the need to release the seventh seal you are the need to identify the third pull you are the need to identify the Lamb of God in the opening of the word you are the need now how's it going to come in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound I'm tying it together right here the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets ready for this when he shall begin to sound can I say it like this or when he shall begin to disclose one's mind when he shall begin to present by speaking the messenger of Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he is going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers to the truth and two he will reveal the Mysteries now young people can I preach you for a second CU I know what the devil says the devil says no they just need a Bible story they just need a little Bible story and just tell them a little something you know but no see you can sit there and see that picture and say that's Christ can I say this our 5-year-olds are further down the road than 50 year old theologians come on church that's why you got to get in the message and get beneath it and just say what a prophet said and when you say what a prophet said it rebukes confusion and here's what he said the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so you got a seven seal book so go get in that seven seal book and get beneath that seven seal book and rebuke every devil of confusion and receive the Revelation that was thoroughly convinced and identified by a word Prophet listen Church who dare say that wasn't the inspired word of God when he foretold it there and S it out yonder in Arizona and brought it right back even with science and everything else and prove that it's so are you ready for this and I'm closing this book is already opened come on church this book is already opened brother brother Hallelujah brother Joel the book's already open the prophet of God said that's right it's just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified of the coming of Christ I say this and I'm done go open the word move Christ into you Amen in one of these mornings amen can you can you give me that picture again amen one of these mornings amen God provided rapturing Faith he provided you a ride come on church he provided you a ride come on you ain't got to find a ride brother ain't got to find a ride brother Morgan we ain't got to go hunt up an idea we ain't got to go hunt up a Baptist preacher we ain't got to go find the new church our ride is here Glory Hallelujah come on I'm riding on it what are you riding on I'm riding on Revelation 10 I'm riding on Malachi 4 I'm riding on the anointing I'm riding on the pillar of fire I'm riding on the message of the a come on can I say this I'm riding on the truth I'm riding on the truth and you know what the truth says the truth says you already made it you know what the truth says it's underneath the blood get out from under the condemnation and get underneath the message of the hour it's the truth brother Bobby it's the truth Church of the Living God it's the truth

forsaken me no he hasn't that's a lie but the truth says I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I will be with you always I will be with you always even until the end or the consummation of the church ages can I say this can I say this and I promise I'm done John can I say this we're not Judas I'm not going to read it to I'm gonna preach it to you brother said this holding the word he said this is your opportunity he said this is your opportunity can I say this we're not Judas sister Joyce we're not Judas we're not Judas you know what the Bible says go read it when you get home the Bible says that Judas amen sought opportunity to betray Jesus Judas come from the oh God from the son of predition he actually put all his effort into finding a way to betray the truth God have mercy he can I say this to you amen but why are you driving these kids Mark to camps brother Matt why are you preaching meetings why are you holding meetings amen why are you all traveling around and going to meetings and enjoying the anointing because you're seeking an opportunity not to betray the truth but to believe the truth and to receive from the truth why do you come here on a Wednesday night and the devil said you'd been better off at you stayed home because you're not Judas and the truth said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together why do you praise God when your body don't feel like it because you're not Judas you're the bride and the word said let everything that has breath praise ye the Lord amen why brother John do you believe God in the face of impossibility because you're not Judas you are a part of truth and truth says With God all things are possible stand God praise stand to your feet and give God praise let our musicians come let our musicians what is truth
