How many's thankful for the grace of God tonight? Where would we be tonight if it wasn't for his mercy and grace? I thank the Lord we can feel his presence once again this evening to realize he's not dead. He's very much alive and he's wanting to give it to you more than you want it tonight. How many come to have a good time in the Lord? I certainly feel his presence tonight. Realize God's got everything in control. And &gt;&gt; do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Well, certainly good to be in the house of the Lord with you. And it's good to be back home. We've been on vacation for over a week with some friends and a couple ministering brothers and just had a really good time and just been in prayer for brother Andrew and his family and he uh had to take his son to the hospital last night and broke his femur bones. Just remember him in prayer and thank his wife. His blood pressure is up some and maybe going to take the baby this weekend. So, a lot of things going on. I think brother Andrew was supposed to be in Georgia this week. So, it'll be a prayer for him and his family and and u just glad I was home to be able to help him this evening and that's what it's all about. God got it all in control. He's mindful each and every one of our needs tonight. If you got a need, won't you just make it known to the Lord? And I know he's more than able to meet each and every one of our needs tonight. God sees every one of your hands. Lord Jesus, we thank you for this time that you have given us, Father, to worship you in spirit and true. Father, we pray, Lord God, tonight, Lord God, that you'll come down in a unique, special way, Lord God, and minister to the hearts of the saints here tonight, Lord God. We pray, Lord God, for brother Andrew's little son, Lord God, that you would mend his leg back normally, Lord God. Let it be a fast recovery, Lord, that your hand be upon his little sweetheart, Lord, and face coming up this week, Lord. We pray, Lord God, that you'll be in every decision. Give them traveling mercies. Lord, we pray for our pastor, Lord, has uh gone down to spend a few time days with his family. Lord, we pray that you'd be with them and their fellowship and give them traveling mercy as well. Lord, we're here tonight, Lord God, expecting great things again in the house of you, Lord God. We commit this time to you, Lord Jesus. Every hand that is risen, Lord, we pray that you'll minister to their needs tonight and meet them here this evening. We ask in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. And the bride says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Can you give the Lord a hand clap or praise this evening? Amen. You got your Bibles tonight and invite you back to Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10. It's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many joys feeling his presence? Amen. Joining together and joining our licks of fire together and just expecting God to do some great things and Amen. That's what it's all about. And hope we never allow it to become a ritual to us. And amen, every service is unique. is specially designed by the father. And we uh we understand those things tonight. We we sure appreciate you tonight. Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 said, "Finally, my brother, be strong in the Lord and the power of his might, and put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, against principalities, against powers, against rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take you on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and have done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your lo loins gird about with truth, and having the breastplaced of righteousness, and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace, and above all, taking the shield of faith, where you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is his word, which is the word of God. Amen. If you can have your seats tonight, just ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word. And we took these scriptures last time we was with you a few weeks back. And we just like to pick it back up here again tonight by his grace and looking at a few things the last several days. And just uh been burning on our hearts and but we like to preach it once again on the bride's arsenal. And we uh we spoke last time on the arsenal is array of resources available for a certain purpose. And we realize even as brother we would take us many times back to the military back to to the times he said he would make a statement like this you know United States gives their military the best he can. And he says you know that that they're always trying to revolve. Brother Brian they're always trying to get better. They're always trying to get greater. But he said, you know, God gave us the best. He can give you to sweep you all the way from the Garden of Eden and to the rapture. And he said, it was his word. And his word can defeat Satan any place, under any conditions, any time. It doesn't matter. It's a ray of resources for a certain moment or a certain time. It's a predestinated moment in your journey. Amen. That God knew that you was going to be facing something that you never knew was coming. But God who's rich in mercy had an array of resources for a certain purpose and that purpose was you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in a in a military sense as we mentioned last time we was with you and know it was a time where it was uh uh uh President Trump was meeting with Russia's uh uh president and &gt;&gt; and and just a show of strength. They would they flew over a couple B2 bombers and and and and I thought of about the how how how powerful a B2 bomber been around many years and Amen. And and and we had these big bunker uh buster bombs that they just uh flew across for 30hour flights over to Iran and dropped them in a certain uh location. It was array of resources for a certain purpose. Yet they never used those bunker bombs before. But when that certain time came, they had array of resources. Amen. And I believe that's a way in in the in the time of darkness, in a time of such gloom and doom in the age that we're living in. Amen. I believe we got the most powerful voice called the message of the hour. How many believes the message is powerful tonight? Amen. We have it on pages. We have it on tapes. Amen. But today, what about manifestation? You are the final voice to the final age. And if that message is powerful, what about you and I tonight? Manifestations of that very voice of the message of the hour. A vindication that God's not dead. Brother, he's very much alive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. What brother said, we want thousands of lit voices. I ask you to look around Grace Tabernacle tonight. Amen. It's not just on pages any longer. We are yet church. Amen. We are that church. Amen. For a final age under a final time in a final moment. Amen. When it looks like there's no hope, God's got array of resources. Amen. And nothing hell can throw at our way that our God who's rich in mercy has already predestinated array of resources to meet the challenge of this age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in such a time as this. Amen. This bride is the very product of that voice of Malachi 4. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We realize in the age that we're living in, it's a technology and it's it's quickly advancing. Amen. We can look at AI and how technology is is going so far. And as as you get older, you can begin to look back, you know, when we was young kids. Amen. and and and to where we are now and how much, you know, that education and knowledge has unraveled. And who ever thought that we'd have cell phones and internets and &gt;&gt; Amen. just at our disposal and and they think how could it advance any farther? But it will &gt;&gt; another 20 years, you know, if things are ravel because we're constantly learning. But thank God, God's not that way. &gt;&gt; He's all knowing. He's all powerful. He knows every flea. He knows every sands on the seashore. He knows all the stars that's in the heavens. Amen. And he rewrapped the gift and he sent it back to you and I. Amen. That we can be victorious in the age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Yet, we're trapped in humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We make mistakes. We fall short. And we're humans. I was visiting with some friends the other day and we got to talking about some of these things and and how that you know that that we live in such a a great hour and there's such a revelation. There's such a there's such a great vast of the Holy Spirit that's moving. Amen. There's such praise and there's such worship. There's a shout in the camp. Amen. Because of God's words unfolding at such a rapid pace. &gt;&gt; It's getting to the bride. There's never been a day like this day. This is the age of transa translation. This is the age of a rapture. This is the age of a body change. And I believe there's a ray of resources for that certain purpose. Amen. It's not way out there. He said everything that you have need of. Even the of this body change, the rapture is already within you. You you're not waiting on something great to come, church. I'm telling you within you is everything you have need of. Sister Tammy, he said, "Just keep drinking." Amen. More you drink out, the more it'll push out. Amen. All of a sudden, brother and sister, we're going to be traveling along. We're going to step right out of this division. And there's nothing hell can do about it. There's nothing churches can do about there's nothing flesh can do about it. &gt;&gt; Cuz when that appointed time comes, there's going to be a array of resources for that certain purpose. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; But as long as we're trapped in this human body of m of this mortality, humanity, &gt;&gt; we lean, we lean to what we can see. And &gt;&gt; and we lean to what we could hear. And &gt;&gt; but the whole senses, brother Andrew, has limitations. It can only go so far. &gt;&gt; It can only take you so far. It can only reveal so far. &gt;&gt; It has an end. And same way with imagination, conscience, memory, affection, all those things are good. Amen. But they can only take you so far. &gt;&gt; It has limits. Brother would tell us that it's the unlimited resources of God has never been tapped yet. There's blessings and powers that we know nothing about &gt;&gt; and never been ever revealed even to archangels. is laying just ahead for his church that will believe. &gt;&gt; For eyes has not seen and ears has not heard, neither has it entered in the hearts of man what God has for them in store for them that love him. &gt;&gt; So let's move up and claim our rights. &gt;&gt; God opens the gates and swings out the welcome mat. &gt;&gt; There is an array of resources, untapped resources. We just step over into a tree of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where all things are possible with them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the power of God that's going to change these vile bodies. &gt;&gt; Let's water it tonight &gt;&gt; with our praise and worship. &gt;&gt; There's no way to stop the living word of God. &gt;&gt; For she's the final voice to the final age &gt;&gt; underneath her messenger. Death can't stop it. Hell can't stop it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God is powerful. &gt;&gt; And a believer walking on the tree of faith, nothing can stop them. &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge, the tree of senses can tear you so far. Brother Joe, &gt;&gt; but once it reaches the end, we step right off of that onto the tree of faith. He says, &gt;&gt; "And that tree &gt;&gt; is a ray of resources &gt;&gt; where all things are possible &gt;&gt; to them that believe." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You believe it. &gt;&gt; Job 3:9 says, "Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles. Prepare for war. Wake up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near. Let them come up and beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. And let the weak say, "I am strong." &gt;&gt; See, it wasn't not it wasn't the plow shares. It wasn't the pruning hooks. No, sir. It's a believer in contact with his maker. &gt;&gt; A rock can destroy a giant. &gt;&gt; An Oscar can defeat 600. A jawbone can defeat a thousand Philistines. &gt;&gt; It's the force that's behind that &gt;&gt; that makes the difference. &gt;&gt; It's a badge of authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. The cop, he has a past. &gt;&gt; He He He has scars. &gt;&gt; He's been through griefs and sorrows. &gt;&gt; He may be lame. &gt;&gt; He may be crippled. Brother Brian, but if he's wearing the badge, amen, of authority, and upon that badge is a seal, and behind that seal, amen, there's authority, and behind that authority, there is power. It doesn't matter what kind of vile body that police officer is standing in. But if he's wearing the badge of authority, everything in that county, in that country is behind that man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has array of resources behind him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said that poor fella couldn't stop anything. &gt;&gt; He said he couldn't, brother. He said he couldn't even stop a runaway pony from his strength. Certainly not. But he walked out in the street, the big bad shining, blowed that whistle and held up his hand, brother. 300 lb horsepower, squeaked brakes and everything else. It wasn't the power of the man. It was an authority that he had. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the church. It might be a bunch of holy rollers. &gt;&gt; It might be a bunch of rednecks, hillbillies from Arkansas. Paladen, Black Rockck, Warner Ridge, Pocahontas. Amen. Is gathering in a barn. That was a nice sanctuary." Amen. Praising God. Amen. It might not look like a bunch to the world, but Soar, whatever you want to call it, he says, "But it's the authority that's behind her." That's what does it regardless of conditions. Didn't matter how lame he was. Didn't matter how crippled he was. Didn't matter if he's black, rod, red. Didn't matter how fat, how little he was. Didn't matter how rich or poor he was. What was behind him was the power of that country. I say church of a living God, a bunch of hillbillies from Arkansas, what's behind you is not just the power of this country, but the power of almighty God. Amen. And you are the manifestation of the voice of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; I say you are an invisible army. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can see our bad days. We can see the the shortcomings. We can see our failures. We can see our mistakes. &gt;&gt; But beyond that, church, &gt;&gt; my if I had a subtitle tonight, brother Brian, I'd like to take victory with the limp. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen. He says, "Regardless of conditions, God's law works with his word. It won't work with a creed. It'll work with the word. It just works with the word regardless of conditions. He says, "The greatest experiences I ever had to come up against something I couldn't get over it. I couldn't get under it. I just stood there and watched God make a way through it." &gt;&gt; That's the way to do it. Just move and keep moving on, brother Mark. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Just keep moving. Press your nose against it. Just keep moving. Just keep going on. God will make a way. &gt;&gt; Before you get there, there's a predestinated resources. Amen. For this bride's arsenal, amen, is very equipped. &gt;&gt; What kind of God would we have tonight if he just gave you a halfway message, &gt;&gt; a halfway religion, a halfway power? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. He said even archangels know nothing about but you church. You that can believe. All things are possible to you that believe. Mountains can be disintegrated. &gt;&gt; Feelings can be broken. Depression can be struck down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oppression can be omitted. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a fairy tale. Amen. I say I say tonight we can hear it every church service. But it's still the gospel truth. All things are possible to them that believe. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians tells us, "Last I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelation that was given me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffer me, lest I should be exalted above measure." Brother Andrew, &gt;&gt; for the this thing I receive the Lord thrice that I might depart from me. And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee. &gt;&gt; For my strength is made perfect in weakness. &gt;&gt; For when I'm weak, I am strong. The word strong there means able or powerful or means excelling in something. It means to be a mighty man. It means to meet the challenge &gt;&gt; for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts &gt;&gt; to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have treasure in earthly vessels for the excellence of the power may be of God. &gt;&gt; It may be of God, brother Jared, and not of us. &gt;&gt; I hope you catch that tonight. We are troubled on every side yet not distressed. &gt;&gt; Come on. In other words, he's telling we're trapped in human flesh. We're trapped in humanity. &gt;&gt; We got We got trouble on every side. You're not yet you're not distressed. We are perplexed but na not in this despair. We're persecuted but not forsaken. We are cast down but not destroyed. Amen. thousand can fall at this side, 10,000 at this side, but cannot come nigh unto thee. &gt;&gt; Treasure in earthly vessels. &gt;&gt; Amen. What an absolute. &gt;&gt; It's perfect within itself. It's unlimited in power. It's the ultimate. It's the Amen. It's the final voice. &gt;&gt; It's the anchor of the soul. Amen. When this is ready to quit, &gt;&gt; Romans 8 tells us we walk not after the flesh &gt;&gt; but after the spirit. And brother Brown would make a statement like this. My flesh says don't do this. Or my flesh says I'm too tired. &gt;&gt; He said, but my spirit, brother Tim, says you're not. &gt;&gt; Your flesh may be tired, &gt;&gt; but you're not too tired. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're predestinated for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, you're not tired. And he said, I'm the boss. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; Follow me to victory. Follow me to deliverance. And then he goes on, brother say, I seen a ship one time when it was tossed out there and I thought, what's holding that ship and that same spot? I couldn't understand it sitting out there in the sea. He says, "And I noticed the waves have carried it around this way and back around this way, but it didn't move from that position or place rather. I could not see nothing. It was unseen in a time of trouble." He said, "But there was a little wire rope there that run down to the bow of the ship unto an anchor that had caught something beneath." Oh, he says my where I could not see beyond the water, it was holding there. Amen. That ship might have looked battered. That ship might have looked broken. Amen. But there was an unseen resources. Amen. Declare. It was declaring victory. Before the waves, there was already an anchor. &gt;&gt; Before the storm ever raised up, there was already an anchor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before They came against Bailac and Balam ever came against the children of God. There was already atonement, brother Bam said was in effect. It was already in effect for the children of God. Amen. They didn't realize it. He said there was a shout of a king that was among them. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they was trying to condemn them and curse them, God said, "I can't curse what I've already blessed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, he said it was holding him. He said, "Praise be to God. It isn't the ship doing the holding. It's the anchor doing the holding. It isn't what I am or what I will be or what I was. It's what he is now." &gt;&gt; It's what he is now. &gt;&gt; James tells us, "Be you also patient and establish your hearts. strengthen, make strong &gt;&gt; or to make stable. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram would say, give them this undergirling power. Undergurt is fortify. I dealt with this a few months back. Fortify or strengthen or brace you up. It's a power of the faith of knowing that thy never failing presence will be with us. Then the hour we cannot help ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know the angels are encamped around them &gt;&gt; who fear him. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou will revive me. &gt;&gt; I got something, brother. I got something on the inside of me. It's taking me on and on and on and on. &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest. No matter what it is, how hard it is, how great the obstacle is, it doesn't matter. If it's down through the valley of the shadow of death, the Lord thy God is with thee. It may seem like you're sinking. &gt;&gt; Hope you're catching. I I I'm going to hopefully get somewhere tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. It may look like that ship is broken. &gt;&gt; It may look like, brother Benji, that that is is it may be sinking. &gt;&gt; It may be failing. &gt;&gt; It may be coming up short. &gt;&gt; It may be tossed about over here. and talks about over here in the wind as tormenting that vessel to no end. &gt;&gt; But in the unseen world &gt;&gt; down below the water &gt;&gt; there was an anchor sure and steadfast. &gt;&gt; Amen. It goes against our nature but it's a fornowledge of God taking place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can't lose tonight church. &gt;&gt; Amen. We say it a lot. We can't die no more than God can die. We can't be destroyed. You say, "Brother Joe, why they put us in the ground somewhere?" Amen. That has not brother Morgan has nothing to do with it. Amen. It's just a holding place. Death is only a tool in the hand of the maker. And death doesn't have control over a believer. Hell doesn't have a control over a believer. &gt;&gt; And though you take your last breath on this earth, I've got loved ones. I buried my two kids. I I buried my uncle. I buried my grandfather. Amen. But there's coming a day, church. Amen. And I've got assurance tonight. Amen. That grave ain't going to hold that body down. And I know in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, I'm going to be changed to catch up. &gt;&gt; Meet them in the air. It's not a fairy tale. It's a reality. Amen. It's array of resources &gt;&gt; that we can't help it. We can't defeat death. But he has. &gt;&gt; We can't defeat hell, but he has. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That little old ship that night, he says all hopes were gone and she was toss about. Looked like the eye last hour was there. But all at once, someone came walking on the water. Just as calm. He's always there. He's never late. One more dash and the ship would have went down, but he's always there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He came walking. I know I did preached this here before, &gt;&gt; but he came walking, brother Angel, on the very thing that was trying to destroy them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was making us a He was making a statement to the disciples. Amen. This storm is under your feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God and the message of the hour has told us and screamed, "Amen, it is over. The battle's over. The victory has been won." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything is under your feet. &gt;&gt; And I understand, let's rewind for a second. I understand we get trapped in our feelings sometimes. As brother Matt or brother one of the brothers was mentioning here the other day about brother Brown tell him you know tell him tell him I'm not here. We get trapped in our flesh sometimes. We get trapped in our feelings. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we say things that we don't really mean. &gt;&gt; From the pastor to the preachers to the back door. We all human. &gt;&gt; And I believe brother Brown spent time and not just time but words on tape to let us know. Amen. Amen. How human we can be sometimes. But how powerful we still are. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in us than the he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; This flesh may get down. It may get weak in the spirit. Our spirit may be wounded, but down inside a believer is the power that generates his resurrection. The Holy Spirit is in you. Now, brother Brand would say, God said to Paul, "My strength is perfect in your weakness. My strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker. More you can yield to me, the better I can use you. &gt;&gt; And remember, brother Brown said, "The secret to power is humility. &gt;&gt; The way up is down." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, you be exalted, you'll be abased. &gt;&gt; But bring yourself here and God will bring you up here. &gt;&gt; Is that the message? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "The more you can yield to me, the better I can use you. The more you can forget about your education, the more you can forget about the denominations. The more you can forget about your stuff &gt;&gt; and yield yourself to me, the more I can use you because you become weak. &gt;&gt; My I'll make my own purpose strong." &gt;&gt; Think about that for a moment. Amen. We can get so beside oursel and letting go of our feelings, letting go of our ideas, forgetting about our feelings, letting go of our past &gt;&gt; and get to a place where God can make his purpose real in our lives. Amen. How many would like that tonight? &gt;&gt; I can make my own purpose strong through your weakness. Come on. &gt;&gt; And Paul would say he's a a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of the devil to buffet me. &gt;&gt; And buffet means, I know you know these things. Let's rehearse it one more time tonight. &gt;&gt; Buffet means blow after blow, wave after wave. &gt;&gt; You get knocked down, you get back up. You get knocked down, you get back up. You get pushed down, you get back up. Wave after wave. And look at Paul. And Paul's He's he's he's talking to his father and he's telling a buffet of blow after blow, wave after wave. It would get better and here it come again. He said, "Lord, what's the matter? You don't take this away from me." He said, "Paul, my grace is sufficient." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul just keep on moving his head to the Lord. Lord, why don't you take this from me? I'm here in I get down. I have a good day, then I have a bad day. I have a good day and I have a great moment. I have a bad moment. &gt;&gt; Lord, I've asked this twice. Can you please take this from me? Paul, my grace is enough. Amen. &gt;&gt; My grace &gt;&gt; is sufficient. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jacob wrestled with the Lord. Wrestled with the angel of the Lord. When the night was getting long, Brother Brad would dramatize it out. He said, "I ain't going to let you go. until you bless me. &gt;&gt; And he wrestled. Brother R would say he had a wrestling party with the angel of the Lord. He wrestled with him, brother Andrew, all night long. &gt;&gt; But that night, he came there as a deceiver &gt;&gt; and a coward. &gt;&gt; But he came in contact with a greater power &gt;&gt; than that of Jacob. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had a determination &gt;&gt; that I'm going to hold on &gt;&gt; until I receive my blessing. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you feel that way tonight, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. The very power that's going to get us out of here. Amen. I want to water it tonight. I want to water it with my praise. I want to water it with my worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was then that Jacob become a prince of God and his name was changed. He said you remember he was a great strong man on this side intellectual power but on the other side he was Olympic prince. &gt;&gt; Listen to this brother Ben. He said he was weak and wore down but had the power of God before him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. this great big strong w he said this great big strong he was Jacob on this side of the river a great big strong healthy coward and on the other side of the river he was a limping Israel &gt;&gt; on this side of the river he was a strong man Jacob but on a deceiver on this other side of the river he was a limping warrior &gt;&gt; not afraid of nothing &gt;&gt; he said what the church needs to do is to do Like Jacob, pray till you get a vday. &gt;&gt; Jacob had a wrestling party all night long with the Lord. I'm just not going to let you go until I get the victory. &gt;&gt; And then about daylight one morning, he had a Vday. He didn't walk the same anymore. &gt;&gt; He was a limping prince. &gt;&gt; That side of the river, Sister Debbie. Amen. He was a big strong coward. &gt;&gt; He walked the walk. He looked stronger. He looked more powerful on this side. Amen. When he wrestled with the Lord, the angel of the Lord reached down into the hollow place of his hip. &gt;&gt; And from that moment, it changed him. &gt;&gt; His walk changed. &gt;&gt; His attitude changed. Come on. &gt;&gt; And church, he left there with victory. &gt;&gt; Listen. He says &gt;&gt; by daylight, he said, "But on the other side, he's a limping prince. A limping prince with enough courage to fight the whole army of Esau." And Esau said, "I'll furnish you with an army." I like this response. &gt;&gt; He says, &gt;&gt; "I don't need it. Same way David said, "I don't need your armor," Saul. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't need it. &gt;&gt; I I might have took it yesterday, but I came in contact with my maker. &gt;&gt; And the most powerful weapon is a believer in contact with his maker. &gt;&gt; It changed him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe it changed him in a way. He came out of that valley that day, brother. Amen. limping &gt;&gt; to the world. He might look broken and wore out. He might not look like he can maneuver like he used to. &gt;&gt; Amen. But beyond that, he had array of resources for a certain purpose. He had an arsenal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was a limping prince. &gt;&gt; But he had victory. &gt;&gt; Every time he would get in the battle, Amen. I believe, brother Andrew, he might have held on to that limb. He could look down and say, "This is not my battle. &gt;&gt; This is not my battle." Amen. The limp kept the servant humble. &gt;&gt; Every time he say, "Brother Brian," and when he got to a point, man, I I can do this. He would get up in the morning, begin to walk. &gt;&gt; And he begin to realize, "I can't even walk without him holding my hand. I'm nothing without my God. He's the one that fights my battles. He's the one that fights my enemy. I'm nothing without him." The secret to power is humility. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had the victory with a limp. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. He was a limping prince with array of resources. Untapped resources. I don't need your army. &gt;&gt; I don't need your strength. Paul, my grace is sufficient. It's not diluted down. How many growing up around the messes, grown out in denomination, sister, we just got tired of such a diluted message, &gt;&gt; a diluted so-called message, a diluted service, &gt;&gt; a diluted word, &gt;&gt; men's idea entached with the word. &gt;&gt; It deluded. &gt;&gt; Amen. It concentrated. It's 100% truth. Hallelujah. It ain't 1% nothing else. It's 100%. &gt;&gt; We don't need it diluted. &gt;&gt; It's 100% life. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never fail you. &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you. I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, brother. The angel of the Lord changed his walk to a limp. Oh, brother. From that moment, he knew it wasn't him. &gt;&gt; It's the God that changed his walk. &gt;&gt; Greater power than that of Jacob. Now, through God's transforming power. I am what I am by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; God lets a messenger of the devil to keep me beat down. He said, "Then when I'm weak, &gt;&gt; come on, somebody. There ain't nothing happen to God's saints without God, our great shepherd, knowing about it. &gt;&gt; Hey, let let it ring loud tonight. I ain't going to hold you long tonight. All things work to the good. That's not a fairy tale. That's a reality tonight. Nothing happens to you by coincidence. It's only making you stronger. Brother said it's a shaking you. Amen. What does a shaking do? Amen. It gets your roots are growing and digging down deeper. Amen. Makes you stronger. Oh, the leaves may be blowing. The limbs may be crackling a little bit. It might look dark and gloomy on the outside, but underneath there's an anchor of the soul that is sure and steadfast. &gt;&gt; We may be limping. Amen. Brother Donnie Reagan preached a message one time, too tired to get up. Amen. We battered and beat. Leo waves is constantly bashing at us. &gt;&gt; But here we are. Look around. A bunch of limping pre princes here tonight with the authority of a king. &gt;&gt; Amen. A prince has the badge of authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. We may be limpid in the hour that we're living because the flesh is going back to the elements which it came from. &gt;&gt; Brother said we're stoop shoulders. A older you get, the more you're going back to the dust where you came from. I tell you, this time next year, I'll be 50 years old. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I used to think that was old, man. But but but Danny ain't near as old as he used to be. &gt;&gt; But I can feel it. And if you're 60, 70, 80 years old tonight, you can feel it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a We're a few days and full of trouble. We're going back to the dust where we come from. &gt;&gt; But there ain't no grave going to hold this body down. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, church, it's not a real It's not a fairy tale. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am what I am by the grace of God. Let's close with this tonight. God let the messenger of devil to keep me beat down. He said, then when I'm weak, I am strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. growing pains of grace. &gt;&gt; Growing pains of his grace. He may permit crossroads. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He may permit crossroads to try us to perfect us for his service. He may permit permit that now church both here and on the tape. He may per permit the crossroads for our service. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Like he did Daniel. He gave Daniel a little crossroad one day. You know, he was a great man down in Babylon. He let the king turn against him and throw him in a lion's did it only perfected him. &gt;&gt; Sure it did. He said the Hebrew children went to the fiery furnace. They was determined to stand for his word. The only thing that crossroad did to the Hebrew children. Amen. It stood on the word. It only loosed them from the bands that held around their feet and legs. It only gave them the ability to praise their king. Aren't you thankful for that, church? He said there was just enough fire. There was just enough heat to burn the latches off their hands and feet. Amen. So we can give God some praise. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Joe, do you always praise him like I should?" I don't, &gt;&gt; but I want to. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. We all get to the place like that. But what's a good thing? We get back up. We may get knocked down, but we can look at Satan said, "I'm still coming." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I might not look like I should. I might not be as strong in this flesh body like I ought to. Amen. But down inside of this body, down through the soul of a man is eternal life that had aos of life that never had a beginning and never will have an end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when we go through our crossroads, it's only making us stronger. It's making us get deeper roots. I am &gt;&gt; what I am by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say it with me tonight? I am what I am by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Say, God, why hadn't you took this from me? &gt;&gt; His response could be tonight, Brother Brian, my grace is sufficient for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe God's doing that to break some of the worldly bands &gt;&gt; that got you bound down. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Maybe God's allowing a lot of little pressure to come in your life to break some worldlinism off of your life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. We need it, church. Amen. We're trapped in such a world full &gt;&gt; of of time seeking sir &gt;&gt; seeks our time, seeks our fellowship, drains us of our joy, drains us of our fellowship, drain us with with our family time, drains us from coming to church like we should. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're going through that pressure to knock some of the worldly bands off of you &gt;&gt; so you can praise him like you once did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I tell you, don't you love the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; I might be limping in the age that we're living in. Amen. I might be 50 years old, but down inside of this Caleb &gt;&gt; is another spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Down inside of this tabernacle is made out of stuff that just can't be bluffed. who the sun is made free, &gt;&gt; sealed &gt;&gt; no matter how dark it gets, &gt;&gt; it can't cross the bloodline. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we can sing that song. I'm free. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm free. &gt;&gt; No longer bound. &gt;&gt; No longer bound. Brother Joe, you're still frail. You still have issues. I'm no longer bound. &gt;&gt; I have victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Trapped in humanity. &gt;&gt; I'm an overcomer &gt;&gt; trapped in humanity. &gt;&gt; I'm more than an overcomer trapped in humanity. &gt;&gt; Oh, but one day this humanity is going to catch up where where my soul is already at. It's going to be changing dimensions as fast as we could see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "I'm rejoicing tonight because I know &gt;&gt; I know there's coming a moment in my journey. I'm going to get up &gt;&gt; early in the morning. I'm an early riser. I'm going to get up early in the morning and I'm going to roll out of bed &gt;&gt; and I believe it's going to feel different that morning. &gt;&gt; I believe there's just going to be something more of a longing in my heart. &gt;&gt; I took my last step on this earth. &gt;&gt; I've read my last scripture. I've read listen to my last tape &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden there's going to come a great move &gt;&gt; and we're going to step right into it cuz your array of resources had made it possible &gt;&gt; and we're going to change from the ridiculous to the sublime. Not just the soul, we're going to be changed these vow bodies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This limp that you're carrying is going to be changed. &gt;&gt; We got the earnest. We got the down payment already. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "We've already turned heavenly." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. We've already turned. We've already got a direction. &gt;&gt; We're going home. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? I can read this last quote to you. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; He said, "But you notice God told Noah to pitch the ark. Pitch it inside, outside, both sides." He said, "Well, then I seen what pitch was made out of. It was pine tree, hard tree, cut down, evergreen tree, and it was cut down. And they had to beat the tree with the beating of an iron until they beat their eyes right out of it. And they would take that and they would boil it till it got real hot. And they would take that hot sap rise it and pour it upon the gopher wood. And that gopher would begin open up &gt;&gt; and just soak it in. And when it become full of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; when it got full of the sap, &gt;&gt; when it got full of his Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; it settled, Sister Eve, and it set up &gt;&gt; and it was harder than steel. &gt;&gt; Now the word pitch means atone. It stand between and the pitch that was in the gopher wood in the ark was kept out and atone the believer from the wrath. Noah could not get into the wrath, the waters of judgment. You get he says he could not come into judgment because there was no atonement. There was atonement between him and the judgment. Oh, and I that's it. Lord, get a good openhearted person and pour in the pitch which was the Holy Ghost into the believer. And when the Holy Ghost and fire until they soak it full, they're not their self anymore. &gt;&gt; They soaked it up. They received the blessing for their day &gt;&gt; and it changed their identity. &gt;&gt; It changed who they was. It changed their walk. &gt;&gt; It changed their name. &gt;&gt; It made them different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said they he said until they're so soaked full they're not their self anymore. &gt;&gt; I just don't want to be myself anymore. Then she can blunt the waves, &gt;&gt; blow after blow, &gt;&gt; buffet after buffet, &gt;&gt; temptation after temptation, &gt;&gt; bad days after bad days. &gt;&gt; He says, "Then she can take the waves &gt;&gt; and bump against the logs and knock them out of the way and just keep on going." How many soldiers we have tonight? Amen. Can bump away the logs and bump away the feelings, bump away the hardship, bump away the funny feelings. &gt;&gt; Discord between brothers and sisters &gt;&gt; can just bump it out of the way and keep going. Well, you know what so and so said about you. Just bump the log out of the way and just keep going. Just keep moving on. Don't believe the lie of the devil. I don't care if it's coming from whoever. Amen. Just take God at his word. Amen. Take that brother or sister to the Lord in prayer. &gt;&gt; Good brother. &gt;&gt; Kick it out of the way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And keep on going. &gt;&gt; The wave it might be. Brother Brown said that white cap is 10 times maybe he said 100 times bigger than I am. But brother Jared said, "I'm going to crest every one of them, &gt;&gt; every wave, every storm, &gt;&gt; every tribulation, every famine, every sword, every peril." Amen. Everything that's going to come against you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; How many believers we have in the house tonight? How many has a victory &gt;&gt; inside of humanity tonight? &gt;&gt; It's just like fire. Shut up in my bones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can bump him. You can bounce him. You can kick him. You can do anything you want to. But he's cased over. He's harder than steel. He's reached a point of no return. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We have the victory trapped in humanity, &gt;&gt; but we've got the tools. We got the arsenal. Get behind me, Satan. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You have the voice of victory. &gt;&gt; You're wearing the badge and you're cased over &gt;&gt; harder than steel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everything that's behind that badge. Behind that badge is a seal. Behind the seal, there's authority. And behind that authority is a power of almighty God. &gt;&gt; All that I am, &gt;&gt; you're an heir to. &gt;&gt; Everything I am, I give it to you. &gt;&gt; You speak the word and I will perform it. &gt;&gt; This is my covenant that I have given it to you. And the prophet God says, how many believes what he said? &gt;&gt; And it can never &gt;&gt; never fail. I can fail. &gt;&gt; Jacob can fall. &gt;&gt; But that Israel, there's just something about him. &gt;&gt; When Jacob gets down, there's an Israel inside. &gt;&gt; Every time Jacob gets where he don't want to have fellowship, there's an Israel inside &gt;&gt; and says, "You know what, brother Brian may say, we need fellowship &gt;&gt; more than ever. We need each other. &gt;&gt; We need to join our likes of fire together and begin to lift one another up in our praise, in our worship, and with our presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he's cased over, not diluted down with funny feelings, bitterness, or but cased over by the Holy Ghost and fire. And every time sickness strikes your home, every time trials strike your home. Every time your neighbors say something bad about you, it's only shaking you up. &gt;&gt; Well, Andrew, how victorious would we be when we hear somebody talking about, "Well, praise God. &gt;&gt; It's just making me stronger." &gt;&gt; Well, that's not my opinion. That's what the prophet said. Come on. &gt;&gt; Every time something neighbor says something bad about you, it's only shaking you up, loosening you up so you can get down and get a better hold on eternal rock of God's unmovable word. That's how God does it. He sends the trials to test to prove to shake you up and give you a new hold, a victory with a limp. &gt;&gt; This flesh may look like it's barely getting by. How many's been there before? &gt;&gt; It may be limping through the age of such gloom and doom, but she's cased over. &gt;&gt; She's made out of stuff that can't be bluff. She's a limping prince with a heaven, all heaven behind her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Victory. &gt;&gt; Victory shall be mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Esau says, "Jacob, do you need my armor?" I don't need it. Jacob, do you need our the our arsenal? &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got untapped resources. &gt;&gt; Jacob, you can barely walk. All of heaven is behind me. &gt;&gt; Silver gone have I none, but such as I have, I give it unto thee. I tell you church, we might not look like a uh too much on the outside. Oh, but we can see down on the inside of the inside tonight. &gt;&gt; We have a bunch of limping princes in this tabernacle tonight. Amen. On the outside, on the other side, you was a coward. You was an alcoholic. You was a drug addict. &gt;&gt; You was adulterer. Oh, but you got a hold of something that changed you. Had the ability, Amen. to to resurrect that predestinated seed that was placed down inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it ra there's a resurrection that took place. &gt;&gt; That side you was a drug addict. &gt;&gt; This side you're a limping prince. That side you is an alcoholic, but this side you're a limping prince. &gt;&gt; You'll always have that past. &gt;&gt; You'll always carry that memory. &gt;&gt; But every time you can look down, &gt;&gt; I am what I am by the grace &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; I can't even make it without him holding my head. Amen. &gt;&gt; We may carry those things in our life, in our bosom, but I believe they're there to let you know he's greater than your past. &gt;&gt; He's greater than your alcoholic problem. He was greater than your drug addiction. He was greater than your past. &gt;&gt; What a statement from Paul. Sister if you'll come sister Eve I am what I am David Paul you are what you are not by brother Matt &gt;&gt; not by David Paul &gt;&gt; but by the grace of God &gt;&gt; he wanted him to know that no matter where he went he was going to be victorious &gt;&gt; but he was uncarried the limp Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said that Caleb, he said, "You know what? I thought I was a good guy. A a good guide. I thought I could make those long distance shots. I thought it was me that made those record-breaking shots and killed those big game."
