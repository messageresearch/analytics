young man Lord the need is great I pray for each one here in the room Lord that your grace would be upon them I pray you would give a reward Lord abundantly Lord even above what could be thought or as Lord now father we commit this word this service this this time lord of Fellowship into thy faithful hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we would like to go right into the word um i' would like to go into Ephesians chapter 1 and and uh as this book of Ephesians parallels the of Joshua uh we want to look in here the ninth verse the n9th and 10th verse this this uh book of parallels of course the two books and so we've been preaching out the Book of Joshua and we're dealing with that when Joshua came to the captain of the host of The Lord's army brother man teaches us who that was it was meaz it was Elohim it was God the Unseen one took a took a physical body so he could talk to his servant amen and in the great warrior Joshua brother bam actually says he says that was where Joshua was position amen he was put in Authority by the voice of that angel so we know amen that's exactly what gives the authority to the bride Church in the last days Ephesians chap 1 and verse 9 and Paul's saying this having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation and fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and may the Lord bless his words you can be seated I want to uh just take a few minutes in this tonight and I'm going to continue on this Joshua generation amen and I want to uh just that this morning in your mind we want to transition just for a moment and we read this and I want to read this spe specific area I want to read to you out of the Amplified Bible now making known unto us the mystery secret of his will of his plan of his purpose and it is this in accordance with his good pleasure his merciful intention which he had previously purposed and set forth in him he planned for the maturity of the times and the climax of the ages to unify all things and head them up and consummate them in Christ both things in heaven and things on the earth now I I think it's a powerful thing when the when the prophet uh speaks to us about this uh according to the mystery of his will and I want to I want to just take for a moment here and read uh just a just a definition according uh to the Greek here on the word uh or at least on the word mystery it's the word mysterium and it literally means something into which one must be initiated now before it is fully known see to initiate or to instruct and then anything which is concealed or hidden now we commonly use the word to denote that which is above our comprehension or unintelligible but this is never the meaning of the word in the New Testament it means there it means that there's some Doctrine or fact which has been concealed or which has not been before fully revealed which has been set forth only by figures and symbols and when the doctrine is made known it may be as clear as any other so many people think about the word mystery as something that's uncomprehensible it's not uncomprehending it just means it's something you must be initiated into somebody must show you and when it speaks of even just like the Gentiles when they were in the Old Testament they were they were forecasting that they would be The Heirs of salvation but they didn't know it until get to the New Testament and then the book of Acts remember they referred back and said was it not written in the scripture that he would reveal again the House of David so the scriptures were there but they didn't really know it because it wasn't initiated into it but when God initiates a person then that mystery is made known so it's not uncomprehended it just was hidden until a time that it was revealed and so we look at it in this age of the church and we recognize now that's why that we're not standing here like um trying to teach like like everything's a mystery because at the season we're living God has made plain or has made clear the great Mysteries of the Bible so as that just a hillbilly preacher can preach the great Mysteries of the scripture amen without a lot of Education a lot of understanding you and I'll tell you one thing's different about studying a prophet than there is studying theologians because theologians are not able to bring an exact this is that to everything they're looking at but a prophet does it it's different because he's able to vindicate that he don't just have to say well it could be but most theologians they'll say well so and so said this and it could be this and and it could be this and and then again it could be this but see faith is never built on it could be but Faith must be built on Vindicated World we're not just wanting any faith in this age we're wanting Rapture Faith so Rapture faith has to come from a direct Revelation which is like what Moses gued the pillar of fire out of the burning bush he got a direct Revelation that's exactly what was happening to Joshua at the walls of Jericho a direct Revelation this is your land you see he said the Lord have given to this see this see this the Lord have given thee this land Joshua 6:2 when he's talking to him he actually says these words see the Lord has given thee this land I have given thee see you've got to catch the vision that it belongs to you and that has to come from the authority of the one that owns it that he's given you something and God begins to deal with the church he begins to make it clear so as that you understand what really belongs to you now the brother bam in the adoption Series in part four he'll talk about some powerful little area here and brother said something tied together from me he said and he was taking the word mystery and running it through the scripture and he said see the mystery of his coming he said the mystery of his will and the Mystery of us setting together together now there's three things that you would if you want to write them down you can CU a powerful thought amen there is the mystery of his coming there is the mystery of his will and there's the mystery of us setting together in other words he's showing you that when you see the mystery of his coming you'll then get the mystery of his will and then you'll see us setting together with him amen it'll begin to position the church in your position with God now here's the thing when we talk about the coming of the lord we talk about the mystery of his coming now if you're standing there at the walls of Jericho you can see that was the Lord if you're was at the burning bush you can see that was the Lord now what we dealing with in this age is we recognize that there is a there is a corporate Return of the Lord Jesus to come here at the Gentile age and that the bride churches to be caught up and meet him in the air I was just listening to uh three kinds of Believers this week and brother man said he said now here it is there'll come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that'll catch this bride off of the earth and we'll meet the Corporal body in the air and he said that's what every believer believes amen that that will be that but see here's the thing that traditional teachings and the churches have taught that that we're going to look for that body on the earth and then we're going to to Mee in here so the so the the ministry of Jesus Christ would be in this Nar body but brother random is the one that's teaching us from the Bible it was already there we just didn't know it was there and he begins to teach us on there that there is a mystery to his coming Amen to the Church of God to to the bride Church there is a mystery of his coming to us and that great mystery is it's the mystery of Elohim now if you go back and see this in the piece of trumpets brother man says the wise shall know but the foolish and unwise wouldn't know and he shall appear in the last days to bring these people back to the word so this bride will know her husband her ma the revealed word that's why this has to happen now it wasn't in the reformers and it wasn't in Lutheran it wasn't in the Pentecostals or Wesley he said see he says but the promise for this age see we're living in the age his coming will be now now brother man is not talking about just his physical body he's talking about this is the age that the word he just told you the revealed word is your mate and this is the season the revealed word your mate will be coming to the church you see what he's talking to us about is the mystery and he says watch now he said he packed me over there and he showed me the mystery of his coming and the Mystery of his wheel and the Mystery of a setting together now let's take just a few minutes on this on the mystery of his coming now what are we talking about it's the revelation of Elohim many of you here tonight already possess it now you can say it different ways and I've always been amazed with the by the bride church that sometimes you say it one way and church will think well that's as far off as the east from the west and then you say it a different way they say well that's exactly the way we believe it but really it's the same thing just terms just turns are a little bit different from different directions but when you talk about the mystery of his coming we're talking about Elohim we're talking about the revelation of Elohim of how that God is an unchanging God right God who is unseen amen who no man seen at any time is an unseen God and he is an changing God now that's the direct nature of God is he said I am God and I change not and that's the most powerful Revelation that you can ever catch is that God is God and he said I do not change he never changes amen the the unchanging God with unchanging nature but that God changes forms and that's an important Revelation because one time you see him as a pillar of fire the next time you see him as a man standing next to the wall and you be a man meeting Gideon at the wine press he'll be another time meeting s's mother out in the field amen what it is is God changes forms amen but he never changes his nature no matter the form that he appears into the church amen now we find out here according to Philippians the third chapter amen the Philippians the second chapter amen that brother Adam teaches the whole message the unveiling of God he teaches that message and tells us that no matter what form he's in he remains to be God he is always God and that's why in Joel chapter 2 he said I pour out my spirit saying the Lord in the last day brother said the word pour out doesn't mean like pouring water out of a glass he says it means he's going to change his mask he's going to be God in Mor who was in Mor in the father who was Mor in the son he said but now he will be in Mor thing in the bride it's the same God he's changing M The God Who Wasn't above us it became the God who was with us is now The God Who is in us he is in the people we got himself to the people that we have come to the fullness of time by the fullness of the word amen to the fullness of the manifestation of God this is the last attribute of God to be manifested on the earth it's rapure time and the Church of the Living God is receiving the same Jesus amen he's the same yesterday today and forever but this time he appears in Bride form he's the same Jesus but he is in Bride form amen I love how brother Rand says in here he says see it's the bride coming of Christ amen what is it it's bride coming of Christ amen it's the same Jesus but he packs three different names is it is it beautiful if you start catching the revelation of the names amen he comes as as the son of Son of God he comes as son of of David and he comes the son of man same God but he packs different names three same names amen let's just put it when Jesus was on the earth and he was standing there one day and a blind beggar he wanted to call him the son of David and he got his eyes Sid but there was a little woman standing over there by amen and she began to approach him and she said unto the same man now she said thou son of David have mercy on me and he wouldn't even talk to her he wouldn't even acknowledge that she was talking to him but the minute she changed and said thou St she said unto him Lord amen Lord and when she called him Lord Brother said there it was there was the Revelation the name was the Lord he was the Lord to the Gentiles he was not the son of David to the gentille he was the Lord and under that name she found out that all the power she' ever needed was standing right there but she had to know how to access that power it was in the name she had to recognize him is Lord oh Church of the Living God that's exactly who he's revealed to to the Gentiles in the last day is the same Son of God who is the same son of David but he said I will be revealed as the son of man in the last days it would be a prophetic office that would reveal Jesus Christ and he is not in the Tom in Jerusalem he has not in our history books he's not just back there in Jerusalem he is in the Bride of Jesus Christ the sa yesterday today and forever he's not just in this room he's not just in our services he is packing right inside every member of this bride in the last days he has revealed himself as the son of manen he's revealed himself as the son of man because he packs three names and then the prophet of God said amen now I'm not getting away from revelation of Jesus now amen his three sons names now watch here because in the trial you all know that in 1933 a light appeared to brother brandom and spoke and said as John the Baptist forun the first coming you'll have a message at a forerunning second coming and all the way in 1964 in the trial Amen brother man says he starts calling people blind prosecutors he says because they knew they knew what the promise was they knew what the commission was and brother M had been there so long and he said now but but see scri prosecutor scripturally blind prosecutor he said you're going around and this sounds ridiculous because you're scripturally blind he says but the Bible said in Luke 17:30 that Jesus would be the son of man as it was in the days of Sodom he says now you want to know where is the man he's the same yesterday today and forever you want to know where the nail scars and the prince and things are he said any hypocrite could do that and look at what brother man say he said anybody could dress up like Jesus walk in this room tonight he says but see the Life of Christ returns in the form of the Holy Ghost not a nail Scar the Corporal body is sitting at the right hand of God to make intercessions but the Holy Ghost has come to carry out his word I want you to know that the Holy Ghost has come to carry out his word how many knows that the body is there brother said the body is there there is a literal body in heaven he said but that this body this mystical body is on the earth as a shadow of that body that is there he said that's why when you say that the church can't perform Miracles you have paralyzed his body because you paralyzed his shadow he said but as long as his body is there and his shadow is here the shadow should do everything that the body does you are the shadow of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ what he's casting upon the earth and the work of God should be in the church and because you are his actual body so it's not a nail scarred body amen it's a bride body but it's the holy ghost in the form of that body amen do you see brother man said it like this in the trial he said every knee and every a shall tongue sure he said but he promise now to turn into Power of the spirit and vindicate his word that's what his promise is that he would come as the spirit and vindicate his word in the trial of man said he promised that Christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings showing signs promised it would be he promised that that would be see God promised it and in sech we would see Jesus but the man said this Jesus was God In the Flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known isn't that amazing amen if you take God and put him in Jesus he's God but if you take that same God and put him in the church he's the same God now now I don't know how to explain it but let me just say is a he amen uranium seems pretty harmful doesn't it amen y' anybody know what uranium is just that radioactive stuff they put nuclear bombs your head your your hand melts off if you touch it and on Amen but you know can you imagine somebody taking a water of uranium that was refined and put it in the paper bag and handing it to you and say hey don't worry about the paper bag changed it it'll be all right amen you know that paper bag don't change that uranium and you know that that a plastic bag don't change that uranium it's just as powerful in a plastic bag or a paper bag or a carpet bag it doesn't matter the kind of bag you p in it don't lose his power by the bag and if that's true of the name what about the God of all the creation if you put it in the blue if you put it a p dress and you put it behind the skin of a young child or an elder sister even need to be the same Jesus t with the same power with the same Authority our God is Not de the church the same yesterday today and forever of course this is Jesus Christ that has come down in this age he promised he would be here as the son of man amen it would be in the bride coming of Christ and brother man says if he appeared to us in a physical body and looked exactly like Hoffman's head of Christ at 3 with blood running out of his hands and nil scars over him I wouldn't accept him good now now if you want to go back to history remember brother R said Mark was sitting writing one night and he said there was somebody appeared unto him that looked just like the Lord Jesus with a crown on his head and brother said that in Pentecostal bait right there he said they they have flung to that he said but that Mark was scriptural Tau and when he seen that appear he knew that Jesus wasn't big to the Millennium so he knew that was out of season it was the word out of season he knew that wasn't the Lord and brother said he took that e and throw that him and told the devil to get he wouldn't he wouldn't power if he that and the Church of the Living God's not power in sou posture but Jesus never a promise to come Among Us like that he did promise to come as the sou man to manifest his care in the last days to put this he embodies himself I'm reading directly out spiritual food be see he embodies himself in my body and your body and gives gifts and Goes Through the Ages it's the secret food it's the secret food now let me ask y'all something what was brother bram's real job when he was here what was the real job he had I tell you what brother Ram says about it he said my Ministry is different than a pastor or a teacher he said but this is my Ministry is to declare him he is here now brother Adam might have he might have mixed up a story and used numbers this way and that way and he he proved to us that he had the memory like a man amen but the ministry that he had was not to tell you how many was in the crowd at at the Ohio river which I believe whatever he said on fine with me amen but that wasn't his ministry that wasn't what brother random was sent here to do what he was sent to do is to manifest Jesus so plainly that he would declare that he was here among the church let me just say what brother man said we have the answer to the devil's question he said the headship is him Christ the religion Lord is him the same power of the Resurrection he's manifesting himself the headship is here he is here the headship is here look what it is amen the headship of it when you see the coming of Elohim when you see that now this this makes sense to us makes helps us understand why in Joshua 1 that the Bible said they was to meditate upon the word Day and Night the things that Moses said they were to hold on to now you got to think about this an entire nation was dedicated to keeping a man's words that entire nation was dedicated to keeping those words and I'll tell you why because it wasn't just the words of a man they knew where Moses got those words they knew that those words come out of God's mind and they put it down now now we all look here today and we got a Bible and we can confirm it all but they didn't have that back there Moses was the one that wrote the Bible and and in the first chapter of the Book of Genesis watch Moses and God and God and God and God and what was he doing eloh him Elohim Elohim Elohim why because the author of The Bible was mentioned more times in the first two chapters of the Bible because eloh was the one that was tell Moses didn't know how the world was created but Genesis 1 he said it as if he knew because he was a prophet and God was using a man to dictate words to a church before it was it was am it was the same one Moses met and was re rting the Bible was the same one Abraham meant I always love it I always love it when Moses is writing about Abraham's meetings with meel cazic and then he gets down to the 10 door there in Genesis and talks about how that he entertains the angel and what he did and all the things that happened amen I thought it was beautiful because Moses wasn't there but he says it just like it was that and let me say this amen anytime you can retell a story like that you talked to one of the two people that was involved and Moses didn't know Abraham and Moses didn't know s but the one that was being entertained at the T door and met Moses right there in the bush and that same him that same him was the one that made Joshua as a wall it's the same one that stood on the platform in the last days and read the hearts of the people where from coming because was speaking [Applause] again now if you see if you see why if you see why they kept that word it was because Elohim gave it to them you begin to understand that that was the mystery of the wheel other words the wheel the work was the will of him that was speaking now now if you go back in this brother man will tell us in the Book of Daniel he'll tell us that in the last days that the wise will understand now that's a that's that's a beautiful saying the wise will understand now in Ephesians chapter 5 Paul will say this he says you should awake all them that Sleepless and rise from the dead for Christ should give the light see them that that walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise that's right Redeeming the time that days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is how do you know the will of God unless you know the mystery of his coming see the the the mystery of his will begins with the one that sets the order now I just go in here and say this unless we know the word what's the sign unless we know the word we don't know what to do we can't have faith until we know what is the will of God and he says then if we know it is the will of God the word of God says something that we should gladly follow that see how you going to know the will until it's revealed if you go back in the scripture in Revelations 18 Abraham visits with Sarah and Abraham and after at the end of the visit amen he begins and turns to Abraham and brother he just says something to him like this he says now look being that you're the air of the earth I'm not going to hide what I'm about to do from you and he begins to reveal the entire thing to Abraham and Sarah the same one that read their hearts the same one who proved it was the Lord talking to them then turned and told them the future events of the earth my goodness church and I know there's a lot of prophets and I know there's a lot of people prophesying and some of it's real good cuz Spirit of Prophecy is true right Spirit of Prophecy exists it is the truth it is the spirit of God Amen but but when have you seen people who can who can who can actually prophesy the world events amen what what we around he wasn't just prophesying little things that was going to happen in our lives and little things in our church and things and that's a beautiful the spirit prophecy is beautiful but brother R would stand there and say now communism and Russia he said Iron Curtain and purple curtain and you know what he's talking about world movements and he's telling you how it's going to be and before it ever gets there what's going to take place hey I'll tell you this them driving's cars are getting real right now is that right they're getting real right now amen that woman president standing there she was a vice president but she was wearing purple and she swore amen it's real right now amen the Catholic systems took over America they never fired a shot but it's real right now and everything that Prophet said has been checked right off of the listen the only thing left he said she' be sitting in Boulders or smoldering in ashes but before she smolders in ashes there has to be a visitation of because it's a bride who will not be a part of the destruction it takes the son of man to the bride into the Rapture it's not the will of God that you go to judgment it's not the will of God you part of the destruction of America God Wills to change your body and make you a part of the ruring Mind glory be the god Ministry to find the anointing to tell us these things amen now here's the thing amen the prophet of God will tell us this according to Revelations 10 that this message is going to be given and it will be at the time of the sounding of the seventh angel if you like to read your Bible says Revelation the 10th chapter and the seventh verse and when these things will be revealed it will be the last days that's right amen it will be revealed in the last days and God will properly identify them to the church God will never require you to worship something he don't properly vindicate we are not worshiping at the altar of the unknown God he might be the Unseen God but he's not the unknown on this God has been made known to you and I and my man says it like this in the days in the third seal but Begins the teaching and he says look in the days when Jesus came he said look at this he said they missed it a million miles he said they they even missed John being Elijah and he says in the last days they'll do the same thing you know the scriptures tells us that the very dis deciples and Jesus missed it in Matthew the 17th chapter when they come off the mountain and mount Transfiguration they saw Jesus transfig and they come down they said Master we thought Elias was first come and he said and he came already and you knew it not to his disciples but then he said he shall come again and restore all things and spoke of the coming of Elijah in the last day brother said he was so humble even the apostles missed it what was it getting the day of the Lord Jesus amen the Pharisees the people amen they both missed the messenger and his message they missed the they missed the Forerunner and they missed the Messiah they didn't know they didn't only not know Jesus was a Messi they didn't know joh was John and the in the third seal brother saids watch he said when Jesus came he wasn't known NE the scripture said he came unto his own and his own knew him not now watch this because what we're looking at now brother BR says there's no need of me trying see if if if everybody's going to miss it now brother paints a picture the third seal is so powerful amen that you it looks like ain't nobody going to catch it do y'all know y'all know when Jesus came the first time and John introduced him y'all y'all recognize that it wasn't supposed to be a secret no true biblically like it was not promised to be a secret but on the other hand Isaiah said that there would be mountains that be made Low Places High high plac is low and he he describes geographical changes and it was going to be so publicized and so but brother said hardly anybody ever even knew Jesus was on the earth is that right and other he spells it out said the apostles missed it the Pharisees missed it the people missed it but watch he says so he says but we can get into the place where we say well if everybody's going to miss it why try because today it's promised to be a secret amen but if if God has made a promise to the church that it was going to be a secret said but why try he said that's the wrong kind of Faith he said the kind of Faith you're going to have to have is if there's only going to be one person get it I'm going to give it if there's only one person going to see it I'm going to see it see if there's only one going in the Rapture I'm going in the Rapture you see what it is he promised it see amen and there's the very thing when God makes a promise now the first bride that was on the earth now we talking about the will of God Amen the first bride that was on the Earth was eeve right and she fell in the garden of me but you got to ask yourself what she fell from all right what she fell from was the word amen that was her fault it was the fall was the word she fell from the word and before she could be married amen of course didn't she amen and still staying with the word now the prophet of God said that God who was full of Mercy this is powerful but God who is full of Mercy he said made a way to redeem that woman he promised her telling her in the future the true word would come to her again now the true word would be known to her again now watch when when Eve was fallen into the garden she fell from the word and God says to her the word will come to you again now before the word can come we know that was a woman seat right Christ but before he can come you know what what happens is God gives them substitutes remember brother said God called them to a conference he said but they didn't have nothing to wear they were naked right so he said he went out and found them in their condition and he said he took the Fig leaks off of them and killed two sheet skins and threw them into the bushes and said put them on for the conference so he gave them a substitute that they could stand in until the true word came to them so Moses's Tabernacle was a substitute of the real one the blood of the altar was a substitute of the real one the law was a substitute everything was a substitute amen but Jesus was the real thing he was the real Tabernacle he was the real blood he was the real man he was whatever should have been to begin with the promise was the word should have come through the W it should have come through Eve should have had Jesus but she traded off the word and she took the LIE of the enemy and he says but watch the word will come to you again but brother man says but when the word came to them he said they were so steep in their substitutes that they turned down the wheel and kept their substitute in other words they said to they said to them we got Moses can you imagine that God Moses prophesied was talking to them in the flesh and they were saying sorry brother we believe Moses and Jesus said you believe Moses and you believe Moses you believe me because Moses R me I don't condemn you Moses condemned you because I am what Moses talked about they said more the children of Abraham he said Abraham long to see my dad you see what it was amen the word had come to them said it was it was it was not a substitute it was the real but they wasn't ready to let go of the substitute to accept the we they miss it and they crucified they cut off the head of the messenger murdered the messenger amen and they crucified the messenger amen and look now brother says but watch he said but here's that Gentile Church born here it is born the second Eve is born there at Pentecost and he says now they're born he says they're coming back to the original word he said but then they're going to fall at NAA takes two be now this is important he takes two Eaves and he said one of them fell in the Garden of Eden from the word he said but Christ bride the second Eve fell at NAIA when she traded the word for the reasoning and Creeds and doctrines of man so she done in the New Testament the same thing that Eve done in the Garden of Eden she forsook the word amen but watch but brother R said but when she did it God already knew she was going to do it so he made a promise to the second Eve amen you will come to the word again that's why Malachi said I shall restore sayth the Lord that's why said I shall restore sayth the Lord listen before you ever fail before the genti ever fail God already made a plan to bring you back again it would take the word to restore the chur now watch brother says and in the absence of the word God gave a substitute there's your Baptist your Lutheran your Pentecostal there's your there's your traditions of the church all of those things are substitutes and just like the Pharisees of Le Ona when the real came they were so settled in the sub itute they didn't want to give up the substitute to take the real and so has Leia got so settled in the Creeds they got so settled in the Traditions it's already wrot books we already got schools we already got churches we already got everything we got it planned out how God's going to come and what he's going to do and all that but it was a mystery and God kept it a mystery and only a prophet can reveal the mystery they missed the whole thing and whenever Christ came in the th to the son of man you know what they did they kept the substitute and said we really don't need a prophet cuz we can shout right we can dance and we can have good meetings and we can H Hallelujah and you can't tell me that I'm lost cuz I'm cutting my hair cuz I feel you church that's what the prophet taught us he taugh us not on the end time he said the rain fallowing the just and the unjust alive and that's what they were doing back there in Pentecost man would prophesy the truth and they'd get up and sing in tongues and prophesy directly this what he was saying and then because they were anointed they would say we don't have to listen to you we don't have to listen to you William Bram because we're anointed you can't tell us we're lost you can't tell us we're dead but a prophet but a prophet was anointed to bring us back to the truth now I I want you to see something clearly because today people think about it like this they think well what we need to do is we we need to actually get the church see we we need to get them to Christ and then we can get them to the message now let's just let's just reward that we need to get them to the substitute because what people are thinking they're getting to Christ is the substitute that was waiting until the real Cen see God weaked the substitutes God weeped the inur of people and the denominations and he he turned his head while people baptized in trinary dockins and he gave him the Holy Ghost smoking pipes and every he was weing at the because they didn't know no better but there was coming a day when the truth would restor the church and you would have to stand subtitute when the Bible tells us that God will open these seals he would we the in no longer and we would have to leave the subtit we would have to leave it behind move into the word move into the realities of the word of God listen my says it he said that substitute would work until the time the original can I can I just say something to you we've been in dispensational change now we we crossed the Jordan and we have moved into the Sun the administration I I I I say it in different ways we say it like this it's the administration of the son of man now if you're in a if you're in a real small town and you go and you go up to the county courthouse and they have a license department the title of parment and they they may just have one they may just have one little office there totle Department Revenue Office everything's right there and they may just have one clerk working there you walk up to the office you say to them hey look I like the title my truck they said well we can't do it here at at the T at the at the license you got to go over to the title department first and they you said where's the ti Department say well down to end the town and that same person take off one hat put on another and slide their chair down there now they can do it in this place but they couldn't do it in that place Heen you see God Amen was changing offices it was the same God it was the same God but he had a different office and God has revealed himself under a prophetic word in this age that has brought us back to ex but Paul talk in the beginning we do not have another gospel there is not another gospel there is only one gospel and the message of the hour has restored the Church we're not standing here with I we're standing here with exactly what Paul taught in the beginning under the original you see Jesus proved he proved what was the real he Vindicated what was the real he was promising to be the red but now here's the thing that they fail from the word what will restore a church that fail from the word word the word if you fail from the word the only way to get back is the word if it was the word we lost it's the word we got to be have restore and here's the thing you can give the badst and God bless the Baptist for all the good things they do but you can give them 2,000 years and they can't put us back give the Pentecost 3,000 years and they never shout us back but you give a prophet to the church and that Prophet can restore the church to the original Mind Of God by the word I shared this with the church I think it's a great example I think that that if you ever see what true Vindication is it helps you on helps you on everything you you know uh we had a chance to visit Israel and uh while we were while we were there we went and they have now a temple Institute which is kind of like the old s00 Council and they they actually are putting together the tools for the temple like um they're putting together the shovels and the manura they got a gold one man it's no telling thousands of or million dollars it's worth but it's beautiful and they got the they got the ash pans and the shovels and the altar abrasions built they got the ramps built it's pretty neat cuz we wouldn't even seen it all it's all laid out amen but they were working on this blue curtain it was a neatest thing because the curtain to go into the H H blue right but here's the problem what shade of blue oh now you look across this congregation you see blue blue blue blue blue and there all kinds of shades of blue now can you imagine that your whole life as ministers are dedicated to figure out what shade of blue that is so you read every book amen and and it's so carnal that they're breaking down every cind they're breaking down every l they're dedicating hours of prayer and study to figure out what kind of plant bases were what kind of Shades amen their whole lives is dedicated and and and it's and it's and one of them maybe maybe they put 30 years on it and he comes in and says it's this shape for sure and another guy comes in and say well I've been working 22 years myself and no no no it's not that shape it's this shape and another guy over here said well I I got a group of 100 guys and we sat down and figured this out and it's this and another guy said well no it ain't that we got 10,000 over here and they've been studying night and day and they say it's this well if you was the guy making the decision amen you're going to go oh my goodness what amen how in the world he says it's that he says it's that and he says it's that and they've all got good reasons why it is what it is but you know what if Moses can walk in the room for 5 minutes if Moses can be there 5 minutes Moses can walk in that room and say this is the shade of blue thus sayith the Lord you don't have to study your whole life you don't have to fast and pray your whole life you have now got the answer listen to me people have tried to figure out predestination for 2,000 years we got volumes of books written on predestination but God sent us a prophet say the Lord this is predestination should we be Face Forward backward mer sprinkle should it be in father son Holy Ghost should it be in Bap should it be should it be in the church be but long comes the prophet of God and gives us an the Lord we're not laying right we're not laying wonder if I God is right because God sent us a the mystery of his coming gave us the Myst of his will the will of God on our lives the will of God on how to set our churches up on how to have in our church what to do what not to do how a pastor how how we going to do it the headship is come come this church [Music] [Applause] and what he had in his mind not what I think not what you think is what he had in his mind a prophet has come Among Us and took the back part of God's mind and said this is that that was prophesied this is how it should be [Applause] hand this is what it should be now here's the thing in third seal you can catch this point very quickly brother said but what they missed was the Incarnate Word that's what they missed that's right now watch he says what we're going to do is we're going to see justification that's part of restoration right and then he said we're going to see sanctification and then he said we'll come to the baptism of the spirit he said but then we have to see the Incarnate Word and in another way he'll say justification Make Way for sanctification and sanctification make way for the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost himself he brought the son of man in Perfection to the church am not just a p ISM of a spirit but a word that would direct the church right back to the mind of God we are not confused tonight we're not sitting here wondering what this is and how this is what that is if you're confused it's because you got more than one voice and I think it's time to get back to the original voice of this I don't care what has to about it I don't care what so and so has to say about it we go back to feeling a voice of a prophet we would go back to knowing exactly what say for the here I tell you what you can do you can set listen to people long enough you start wondering what truth is some people got under a godhead teacher and they was teaching them there was to LS you got to you got to speak to the father you got to speak to the son you got after a little while poor little poor little woman sit down to pray over her food and she can't figure out how to even pray now because somebody's made such a deal either praying for the father or praying for son PR amen don't you know these three are one the prophet of God these three are one he said not theology theology is wrong a we got we got to theological just come the prophet of God and stand on what he said about it he said there is one Lord there is one fath there is one baptism there is one gospel there is one Lord Jesus Christ and there is app [Applause] to now here's the thing now if you missed that Incarnate Word you just missed your Revival on you just missed your Revival I'll tell you why the prophet of God in the third seal says this he said there hasn't had a Revival for the ride GI because there's been no manifestation of God distur her up that's 1963 in March sir let me just let me just rehearse something to you amen look at what has been done in the ministry of William brandom up to March of 1963 the dead have been raised the L have walked thousands have been saved there has been outpouring after outpouring after outpouring we don't even have me listen he filled up the biggest auditoriums in the world they had sometimes 100,000 miracles in one year in the meetings and mother said there's been no Revival yet that'll stir up the ride there's been nothing to wake her up so you can fill all the biggest halls in the world it won't wake up the ride you can have the greatest Rivals and miracles that the world has ever seen won't wake up the V because the V would only be awakened by the voice of seven THS when the W to be open up to the church you would to the and bring and oh Hallelujah she wants the word to be the word is Bring Back to the word the make this Hallelujah this have a Revival yet said take those seven thund now I want you watch what prophet said about this amen right here in this sermon of the third seal he says look there's been no manifestation yet he said but now there's some friends of mine and they're got a newspaper and then pray fast and pray fast and pray we need a Revival we need a Revival we need a prophet of God Among Us sir he said now he said see but they missed it now watch he brings this back again in the message recognizing your day in this message is that powerful recognizing Rec recognizing your name and his message and he says see he said we got this Herald of the coming they're supposed to be heralding the coming and they're saying fast and pray we need a Revival he says but they missed they missed the Awakening of the B from March of 1963 through 1964 something happened in there that the prophet of God said they missed what happened what was they missed the sounding of seven ters but other voice revelation of this in theory of the world and God Prophet stood on back for restore the mind of God to the church we have the mind of God we have the will of God we have the word of God we're not just a bunch of Fanatics and and we are the children of the high God coming of the Lord church he has come [Applause] CHR has turn the [Applause] world that's why they're trying to have [Applause] revivals brother said two men went over there over there what was the name of that town switch switch I always get it wrong the w he said two them when I walked up to a police officer said we come over here for the Revival we looking for it what building is it going on in now watch you got two men looking for it and they're asking somebody where it is and instead of sending them to somebody yeah he said we arrived I am the wel reval now people are looking for the brid Revival what minist is what church is it going on there are people who are looking for it but there's other people here T that they have [Applause] to Jesus Christ rest to the word of God if you ever see what done you the Holy Ghost leing while this is not just another seron this is not just another mess this ain't just something to put aside and forget about it's the coming of the [Applause] lord it's the most indicating message since the days of Enoch nobody ever said under anything like this it's been promised in the last day it's the Incarnate Word now brother Brandon tells it when Jesus the word not the substitute and why I love how does not the substitute of the word what was on the earth he said he walked up to Peter and he said Peter was in those substitute he said but he had had a scripture T to him by his old daddy that when the Messiah comes he'll be like this and he didn't carry a picture of him that's right he didn't have a he didn't have a h in his picture he carried his purse or his pocket or something like that when Jesus walked he didn't have that he had scriptural description and when that old fisherman who never had a day theology who couldn't write his name who had no education who had no scholarly a position of any the churches that old fisherman was talking Amen to the Messiah himself and the Messiah looked at him he says hey he said your name was Simon that the J and from now on I'll call you p amen said what happened to him he said the light flashed across the sea he said you see how long that took he said it didn't take long at all did it he said because the seed was already there waiting on light come on it didn't take an all night prayer meeting it didn't take a re wor of Revival the the light touch the sea said it like this he said that light roll back to out he takes it to the little woman at 12 now if you watch if you watch brother B he's not just he's not just picking certain things for without reason he picks Peter who's the Jew and then Jesus goes to a Samaritan a woman at the wh yeah and he says to her bring me your husband she said well I don't have one he said that's right youve had five the one you're living with now is not your own brother said what he done with that that say is he rolled the doubt off of that seed he rolled the the clouds of doubt that was covering the seed of five husbands and her current life was only covering eternal life seed that was in her and when he rolled it away said look how long it took the moment the life struck the seed he said because the seed was on the in out she didn't e all day pray she had s she she need to come man she knew Authority when she saw now brother does it in the third seal and the fourth seal if you'd like to study he does it in both seals third and fourth and he says exactly that was what happened back there in the beginning when God created the heavens and the Earth and was without form of void and what Darkness covered the Earth he said now watch he said the seeds were already in the Earth he said the water was only covering what was already there so when he said let there be light he rolled back the darkness so the light could get to the Sea and exactly what happened at that well that day when that little woman walked up there and she stood in front of the great Son of God who was the light of all the ages and that light rolled the darkness back and the moment that doubt was lifted off of her the seed come to life eternal germ seed watch watch what takes place there and y'all know to tell you the truth some of you was convinced of this message first time you heard it some of you my dad sat back here grew up as a little baptist boy took himself to church cuz his his mom and dad didn't go to church much took himself to church and sat down that Baptist Church and wondered what was about predestination what happened in the garden why is there people talking about one God and three gods and and that little Baptist Church didn't have the answers they were doing good it was a good little group good good brother good people but they didn't have the answers for it they didn't know how to get the darkness off of the sea and remember back about 1964 amen Emma Emma Faith walked in and be to introduce the message to my mama amen and the spirit of God be to move and and my dad said this he said some people run around the message while back and they were saying that you didn't have to love brother man get the Rapture I don't know what that about but but Dad come to me later he said H I'm sorry he said but if You' been like me he said I was standing like a Bo and a dark closet he said and when I heard Willam R begin to describe the Garden of Eden and the and the and the and the godhead he said it's like somebody walked in and turned the light on and all the darkness just went away listen the voice of this message willp all the dark itel all the town it'll tell you who God is it'll tell you who you are it'll take the KN out give you a higher thought now you got to you got to see something because because the gentile people wasn't expecting why didn't Jesus go down to the Gentiles went to them Jes and then Spar why did they go to them Gentiles brother man said because Gentiles were not expecting the Messiah right right but from that time remember Paul began to preach and they begin to expect the Messiah and that's why God had to send the message in this hour listen we are not looking for a messiah we has found the Messiah it's not a man it's God it's the Holy Ghost here to leave the church ration Revelation what is it amen down in that little heart is a predestinated sea that Spirit moved away that past life oh brother that seed can rise up and live that's what brother Ram said he said when the true Vindication the revealed truth of God's word strikes that heart he'll strike the water and out with the Holy Ghost as hard as it can go you can't stop him from doing it because there's new life working in him I love how brother Ram says that he said your name is now in the new book on the Lamb's Book of Life the lamb what he redeemed I love this one IND thisal union he said with the anointed word of God being Vindicated before any man that's born a Son of God with a predestinated German here for this hour he'll see God's message as sure as there's a God in heaven you'll never hide this because it was put in there by predestination you never hide the message from a from a true ger gen Gentile seed of God you never do it amen you can you can pile whatever you want to but the anointed word of this day will speak and he said my sheep know my voice is all right it'll speak it'll be the voice of God that was what was coming from that stranger at the wall that stranger at the wall went from a stranger but when he begin to talk to Joshua he began to take off his shoes because he was talking to the captain of the host that was that same stranger that stepped down on the road to AAS and they thought they were visiting with a stranger but the longer that he visited with at the end of the journey and said it's the resurrected Messiah it was a stranger in the sky when the little Eagle looked up and saw that strange bird but when the voice of the eagle begin to cry he began to say my God the voice of God is sounding to the church and it may sound like a stranger at first after a little while something inside that heart let me say this to you John now in in the Bible the Bible says he that have the bridegroom he says he that has a bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and hear rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice oh yeah this my joy therefore is fulfilled and now watch the next verse John says it like this and he must increase and I must increase now John did that in the first coming of the Lord and he said there's a difference between the bridegroom and the friend of the bride and that friend will rejoice at the sound of the bridegroom's voice and when he hears that bridegroom's voice he said John begin to decrease and the bridegroom begin to increase do you know that William BR on the end of his ministry begin to decrease do you all realize that Brother begin a decline around the world in his ministry and he told us why he said because there won't be two of us here at the same time he said I'm going to decrease and he's going to increase and let me ask you this when Willam Bron was here how many people were sting listening to sermons like this and understanding what they were hearing but in this generation there are thousands of Believers that are receiving the coming of the Messiah by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and see the son of man come among them and manifest his word in this amen what is it it's an increase now I I'll just say this just maybe maybe just to make some things plain here because of the bridegroom's voice that was what the joy of the friend of the bridegroom was now William Braham was not the bridegroom right he was the friend that's right right he was the one introducing him amen do you see this brother tells us this that the voice of God sounds through the word amen now can I I'll just I'll just make it uh just as let me just put it to you like this so brother B standing here and prophesy something all right now now that you hear you hear the prophet's voice yeah but when you see it fulfilled that's the voice of God sounding back see it's one thing for the prophet to speak the word that's the man but when it comes back fulfilled that's God so so brother says see the friend of the bridegroom rejoices at the sound of his voice in other words he was showing you that Christ is here by the Fulfillment of the word here's the scripture that is the Fulfillment he's here how he do brother said how do we recognize his presence you know these quotes how do we recognize his presence whole message on how can we recognize his presence he said when the word is fulfilled among you that that is the presence of God he is appearing to release his desires amen that you have in him I think it's powerful because right here in the middle of this brother R begins to show that the Revelation coming is what brings the joy and there's a lot of talk in the last days about worship and things like thaten but you we got to just get real for a moment and when brother says what we need to do as Christians is realize we're saved he said then get down to the basis of why we were saved and how we were saved and what it means to us as Christians is that right amen and I think tonight amen just as the Church of the Living God as we receive this great voice Among Us amen sometimes people misunderstand I shout it and sometimes people misunderstand our rejoicing and our worship amen but but but be assured friend amen that the rejoicing and the shouting of the bright church amen is coming from the message of Yahweh let me let me let me give you what brother B says in the third seal it's it's something it's something powerful to write out in the third seal the prophet of God says in the middle of that third seal he said there's a voice that comes out out of there and says hurt not the oil and the wine how many those said that the scripture says that hurt not the oil or the wine how many knows who said that brother R said the Beast he says was talking to John he said they were out here he said but this one stood up from among the throne he said it was the lamb himself the voice of the Lamb spoke out in the age and said hurt not the oil and the wine now brother said what does oil mean don't hurt oil what does that mean he said oil means the Holy Ghost oil is a type of the Holy Spirit don't touch the spirit of God in the church I can put up with a lot of things folks that when I hear somebody bing up against the move of God something inside of my heart just turns over I cannot stand to hear somebody amen coming against God God's worship and God now there's a reason being it's because I understand where it's coming from if you were walking down that Hall and you just started screaming you're just walking down that Hall and you start screaming maybe two or three of these deacons to get up to look out there to see what caused you to scream they're looking for what caused you to act like that amen and instead of worrying about you screaming we need to find out what's causing the scream let me tell you what's causing the screaming in the church in the last days it is the oil of the Holy Ghost is in the church and C A stimulation of the revelation of the word of God in our hearts said r word causes stimulation the wine represented revealed word causing stimulation says I know how he says it he I'm just simp Heil so heiling things help me and he said this he said this spiritual wine called the new wi he says and the reason they call it this he said because he says see natural wine has an effect on a person when they drink it it makes them go unseemingly they act unseemingly when they drink it so the scripture was using Revelation as a symbol of wine because when God gives you a revealed word it makes a person act un sing is there something somebody you take a pretty quiet person amen they to stand on their feet and scream out and Shout amen and they wonder what made me do that well it was a revealed word struck a place in your heart and something on the inside of you had to give V and pulation the same way and I'm I'm I'm I'm going with a prophet here third and four seal both he does and you know what brother R says he says it has the same effect as natural wine on a man well let me say this amen amen if you want a quiet Church you better not pass out the wine go ahead if we invited 120 people in here tonight and we UNC the bottle and we gave everybody a Giff of wine and they drink on that wine a while what kind of group you think it'd be after a little while it'd be people staging around here saying I love you I love here let me give you $100 I love you oh God and somebody be crying another guy cathine laughing somebody staggering around and amen it was like that on the day of Pentecost when the promise of God come among them and they saw them and they thought they were drunk and Peter said oh this is the new W this is come on church this is the W the Holy Ghost and the hold the word and the two come together it'll cause something to happen in the Church of the Living God I tell you this I'm sorry people get upset I've had people say why people stand up and harder in your meetings and stuff what in the world's going on what what is it listen I'm sorry if this message has power I'm sorry now some people water this thing down until they don't have any power and they add all their Creeds and all their dogas and and you feel more like you've been beat up when you leave amen but if you preach this message exactly the way God gave this message it'll have an effect upon the church of living and you'll see a stimulation a revelation stri the heart of the church and Jesus said don't you touch don't touch the all and the wi I got some little masas out here but this is all they got I got some little M that they watch kids all day and they suffer and they got nerves and they're built up and they don't know what to do with theirselves and they don't go down to the bar and drink and they don't take the ner pills and they don't go down to the psychologist but they look at their wies and they read the sermons and then they come into a meeting somewhere amen and they and they they went through hell to get there and they come and sit on the meet and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost picks up something they've been studying and the spirit of God begins to WHL around them and something get the little heart say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah don't touch [Applause] Al [Applause] church I believe it I believe it says here in Revelation 66 to hurt not the oil in the wind Paul said don't quench the spirit quch not the spirit of God is that sound you said let me I I'll help us understand as heal with this again did you ever build a fire you ever build a fire if you build a fire let's just say you build a fire out in your dad's front yard there's two ways to quench a fire number one thing you can do is take a take a a blet blanket or water hose and just spray it down and there are words that people say exactly and God help us sometimes creatures and they take a water hole to the fire of God and the poor little child the poor person it's all the fire the God and somebody spray water on it and 90% of the reason they're doing it brother Ben is cuz they watched the YouTube somewhere and they saw some meeting they don't agree with and they go to their churches and correct the crowd because what they want to do is correct that crowd and what I say is quit being a coward and go down there and correct that brother and leave the all and the wine alone that fire can be neglected two ways you can put water on it and the other way to neglect it or to quench it is just don't put nothing on it just don't put no wood on it and you'll quench it just don't add nothing to it and you quench it but I think we ought to take some fire quotes once in while I think we ought to take some Holocaust quotes once people strong instead ofing out instead of not giving them any on that and say that's right that's right you got a to the Holy Ghost you got to the power of God list we are not a deal [Applause] church I'm pastor of Church in Ohio I don't know how many we got up there I don't want to sound off but but there's there's several people there and let me say this we got some quiet people in our church we got some Qui people saying we really do but I ain't got one former person that whole church I got some quiet people in there that pull the button right off your shirt they don't hard to say one word with their Spirit just like just like brother Harvey sitting there he's sitting there pulling and pulling and pulling he ain't saying a lot but his Spirit saying a lot because something on the inside CAU fire years ago and this message feels as much die as you got God say the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost I say give God Liberty and let the quiet people be quiet let the loud people be loud let the shout shout let the [Applause] danc sh no matter ACC who it's coming from who it's coming from come on we're at the walls of Jero Folks at the captain of the host instructed them walk seven days ins Sil but at the end of seven days sound the seven trumpets and when the seven begin to at the same time [Applause] sh there was shouting going on there was shouting in Jericho shouts of fear shouts of Screams there was all kinds of shouting in Jericho remember on the outside of the walls was the shout of the king that was in theing and all of those voices the Bible said they sound with one voice and all of those voices begin to blend together brother you talking about a sound what was it 2 million people there amen it was a bunch of people and they were stacked around them walls I don't know how the you ever had a Jericho March for 300 people in a small building they had to double uptime amen and there they were and met to make a full circle I wonder how many circles out that' be a good Circle how many circles out was that I don't know maybe they were seven lers deep or something but when they begin to sound to [Music] shout it matters who's doing the shout these Pentecost are shouting and brother said in the worshiping the devil and don't even know it but it f Pentecostal can shout and they were involved hair earrings and makeup and shorts and they're living any kinds of lives if those people can shout then a pure word that's been strong to the rich of the word they to be [Applause] to don't hurt the all why music players come tonight don't hurt the oil sir don't hurt the oil the lne sir these people have been stimulated by Revelation the light struck the seed yes sir
