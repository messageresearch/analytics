========================================

My God has somehow forgotten [Music] that you are faced with circumstance you can't get through. Right now it seems there's no way out. You're blowing a third. &gt;&gt; God's proven time and time again. He'll take care of you. &gt;&gt; He'll do it again for you. He will do it again if you just take a look where you are now and where you been. &gt;&gt; He'll always come through for you. He's the same thou as me. [Music] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know when, but he do it again. &gt;&gt; God knows the things you're going through. &gt;&gt; He sees how you're hurting. He knows your heart. He sees how it's been broken into. &gt;&gt; I know he's the God of the stars. &gt;&gt; How many believes that &gt;&gt; he's still my heavenly father? &gt;&gt; And I know he'll calm every storm. You'll find a way to fix it for you. [Music] &gt;&gt; We'll do it again for you. He will do it again. If you'll just take a look at where you are now and where you be. He'll always come true for you. He's the same now. &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know when, but you do it again. You may not know how. You may not know when he'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight? I believe he's not just a God of yesterday or a God of tomorrow, but he's a God of today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that he's more than able. Amen. He's moving amongst his children. He's never failed us. He's never forsaken us. He's kept He's a He's a keeper of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen.
