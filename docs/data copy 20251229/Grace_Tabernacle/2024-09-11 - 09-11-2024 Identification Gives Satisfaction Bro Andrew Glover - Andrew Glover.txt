hearts together for a word of prayer I know he's in the building tonight I know it's a Wednesday evening and I know we have needs in our heart in our life how many just say Lord come by my way tonight and speak to me amen minister to my needs Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon on this Wednesday evening Lord father we've not gathered here for just a service or just a gathering but Lord we've come here tonight to worship you and to honor you and Lord to give you that which is due unto your holy name but Lord we've also come here tonight to fellowship with you and around your word for Lord you have said that wherever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together and Lord we are eagles here tonight we're not chickens we're not buzzards Lord father we're Eagles and we've come here tonight to feed on the word of truth and the word of life and father I pray that you would come among us tonight Lord you see the needs you know the hands that are raised behind those hands or needs Lord maybe some would be great compared to the others but Lord we know there's no need That's too great or too small but Lord what you can move upon that need and you can change it so father walk among us tonight in the power of your Resurrection Lord may you encourage some heart here tonight may you heal a sickness oh God lord if there be one here empty of the Holy Ghost in fire I pray oh God you would fill them tonight Lord father we invite you among us tonight in a special way and Lord we commit this Mee in thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we want to go to the Book of Romans the sixth chapter The Book of Romans the sixth chapter Romans the 6th chapter and then also we're going to look in the Book of Matthew the fifth chapter amen we just have a few uh simple things here on our heart tonight we pray it'll be a blessing to you uh in Romans chapter 6 and it may be a little bit of a a lengthy reading I want to read down to the 15th verse in Romans 6 uh Paul here writing he's speaking about the divine grace and how that we're not to abuse that divine grace and he says here in Romans 6 and verse one he says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound he says God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death now therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection now knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more then death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died into sin once but in that he live liveth he liveth unto God now likewise you reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord now let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God I love verse 14 for sin shall not have dominion over you amen unbelief shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace amen ye are not under the law but under grace now in Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 6 I want to read just one uh verse there I know we would know this scripture by heart in Matthew Chapter 5 and verse number six amen if you could give me just a little bit more I'll control it on my side uh Matthew Chapter 5 and verse number six you love the Lord tonight amen that sounded better and better a little bit more amen amen that's good blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness now watch this for they shall be filled that's not a possibility that's a promise if you are hungry and you are thirsting after righteousness they shall be filled we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here uh this afternoon I I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to you tonight by this uh scripture here and if I would title this tonight I want to talk to you on this identification gives satisfaction identification gives satisfaction and you know the prophet of God would tell us there in the message the Easter seal he said you know the church is losing its identification and I think that's a very dangerous thing amen is when a church begins to lose its identification now we know in Matthew chap 5 and verse 6 that that's actually uh what the Bible calls Jesus Sermon on the Mount and it says there in Matthew 5 and6 it gives us this promise amen that we would not be empty we would not be partially filled amen but it said we shall be filled amen or we shall be full we shall be filled or we shall be full now when you read the book of Matthew uh the keyword there of the Book of Matthew is the word fulfilled which you would know there that the root word of fulfilled is full and I love that that definition of the word full there amen it means complete so we're not receiving amen an incomplete sermon or a partial sermon but we are receiving amen a complete sermon of our Lord Jesus amen and I believe that we are following tonight the message of the hour and I don't believe the message of the hour is incomplete but rather I believe amen that we have by God's grace the complete revealed word of almighty God now the prophet of God would say and what is the Holy Ghost given for he said now each person sitting here amen is filled with something you're filled with something you cannot sit there without being full of something you've got a life in you amen and that life governs you and that life is governed by Spirit he said now you might be full of the world loving the world the things of the world God be merciful to you he said you might be full of Creeds from some church some little prayer that you say you think that's going to pray to some dead person or make some kind of a cross a sign of a cross you but God be merciful to you he said you may be full of religion and that's that's the worst yet see amen the Bible said in the last days they would be very religious having a form of godliness amen but denying the power thereof from such turn away he said now if you're full of religion amen you're miserable if you're full of Creeds and you don't know what you're talking about amen and if you're full of the world you're blind so if you're full of religion amen you're miserable if you're full of creed you don't know what you're talking about and if you're full of the world then you're blind he said but then again you may be full of a Holy Ghost he said and I hope you are and if you're not I hope you get full amen and if you're full of the Holy Ghost then what if you've got you've got power you've got love you've got peace amen you are sealed you got a sign you got rest you got joy unspeakable amen and full of Glory you are anchored he said that's what you are with the Holy Ghost if you are full of the Holy Ghost amen you have passed from Death unto life amen and are waiting for the general Resurrection in the last day now I'll say this we are not living Amen in an empty age amen when it comes to the word of God the prophet of God would say Amen notice to the Lutheran age to the Western age to the Pentecostal age amen it's been the same thing but notice at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word amen is to be born into manifestation again amen and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength amen as it was when he was here on Earth see manifested in the same way amen do doing the same things that he did amen when he was here on Earth Hebrews 13:8 Luke 17:30 in the last days it was the days of Sodom amen but the son of man will be revealing himself again amen it will be the same thing so the message of the hour has brought to us amen the full word with full strength Amen to produce a full bride now somebody say well I've accepted the message well let me just say this amen accepting the message is not accepting a man amen or Prophet or a preacher amen or anything but accepting the message is accepting amen the full person of the word of God that's been revealed in the age that we're living in brother said it's right now midnight sence says it's 3 minutes till midnight he said but this might be your Midnight Hour exactly on the dot 12:00 he said I didn't know that this might be 12:00 stroke for some of you he said see you'll either accept it not accept me amen not accept what I said amen but accept the Full Gospel the full power amen and the full Bible everything what God says so this church amen will accept the Full Gospel amen the full power and the full Bible he said they want to tell you to stand off right here and eat some peelings or gnaw on some bones amen tell you the chicken is all gone from years ago don't you believe that amen because God has a full Square meal amen for a full man that's got full faith Amen in the Son of God and will believe it amen and will follow the instructions listen we have the Full Gospel amen with the full power with a full Bible with a full Square meal for a full man amen that's got full faith in the Son of God now we find the world that we're living in today amen there's actually two types of people amen there is a satisfied people amen then there is a dissatisfied people and I'll say this everybody amen right now is trying to satisfy somebody else you know amen the Republicans are trying to satisfy amen the Democrats are trying to satisfy amen everything and everybody is trying to satisfy amen but let me just say this that word satisfy has a broader meaning amen than what the world has made it amen satisfi means to meet the expectations amen or the needs or the desires of someone it means to fulfill a desire or a need Amen to provide someone amen with adequate information or proof amen so that they are convinced about something it is adequately meet or comply with the condition obligation demand Amen to satisfy amen it means to pay off a debt or a creditor now let me just say this Amen brother Brandon preaches an entire sermon and calls it amen convinced and concerned and the definition of satisfi means to be convinced now let's just say what a prophet said he said I am convinced that this is God I am convinced that Jesus is coming I am convinced that this is is first appearing in the form of the Holy Ghost in the last day because the prophet said it shall be light in the evening time he said I am convinced amen that scriptures are fulfilled I am convinced that the world's on the threshold of Destruction amen the world order Cosmos but I am convinced amen that the coming of the Lord is at hand I am convinced that we have amen what we have is the Holy Ghost so listen we don't just have an idea we don't just have religion we don't just have a Creed amen but what we have is the holy ghost that was to come into this age that was not to just move up on your flesh or move into your spirit but the Holy Ghost is to move into your soul and when the Holy Ghost moves into your soul amen you will become convinced amen I pray God we get some church members amen that become so convinced of this message amen that the devil can't talk them out of it amen bad days can't talk them out of it amen feelings can't talk them out of it amen because you know in whom you have believed and you are convinced that he is God now I love what the pr of God said he said now God Amen I pray that your great blessings amen more rested up on every person in the building how many say Lord amen I want to see your blessings rested on my brother I want to see your blessings rested on my sister Amen Let the blessings of God rest upon everybody and if there would be some here who is not Believers as yet amen May tonight they be fully convinced in their heart amen that the true and living Jesus Christ has risen from the dead amen and is alive among the church members tonight listen that's more than just a quote friends amen that is a reality that he's not in a tomb in J in in Jeffersonville neither is he in a Tomb in Israel amen but he's alive and well tonight and he's here identified among the church in the power of his resurrection then the reason that we're here tonight amen is first of all because we're Christians amen we're Believers I I'll get in a second amen we're Christians we're Believers amen but let me say this we also have a soul on the inside of us and that Soul has a thirst you all remember David said amen as the heart panth after the water Brooks amen so panth that word panth means to long for amen my soul after thee Oh God David said my soul thirth for God Amen for the Living God he said when shall I come amen and appear before God said not some historical or some something that happened some years ago or some tale that someone told amen but for the Living God Amen a God that's ever present amen and his soul amen was thirsting for that God in Psalm 63 he goes on again and says my soul thirsteth for thee amen My Flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land amen where no water is brother said now what God done in his great economy for mankind amen is he made a man in the way amen that he wanted him to be he said now he made man to thirst we all agree God Amen the Creator made man to thirst he said now God made man with a thirst he said that's a part of the human being is his thirst amen but God made The Thirst in man to thirst for God Amen but the devil has perverted it so that thirst was put there for God Amen but the devil perverted it and made it thirst for his kingdom for the world he said now watch in your soul amen now there's a control tower in control tower in you amen and that's what directs you he said the control tower is in your body amen and there's one in your soul he said the one in your body tells you the need that's needed in your body and it's brought to you by a thirst he said but then there is a control tower in your soul amen that tells you a spiritual things you have need of Amen something in your spirit and You by this can tell amen what kind of a life is controlling you when you can see what your desires are then you can tell by that what kind of something that's in you that's creating that desire that you have let me just say this God Amen created that thirst but Satan amen through perversion perverted that thirst and that word pervert means to be changed over it means to be made something different amen from what it was intended to be so God Amen put a thirst in you and an intention upon that thirst Amen to thirst after him Amen in the power of His reality in the power of his resurrection but the devil's done everything he can Amen to pervert that now in Romans chapter 1 and verse 25 Paul there says amen who who changed amen or that word change is exchange amen the truth of God into a lie amen and they worshiped and served the creature amen more than the Creator who is blessed forever now for this cause God gave them up amen unto vile affection for even their women amen did change the natural use into that which is against nature he said likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman amen burned their lust one towards another men with men working that which is unseemingly and receiving themselves the recompense of their error amen which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge now watch this God gave them over Amen to a reprobate mind to do things which were not convenient the prophet of God said when God made everything in the Garden of Eden it was lovely amen but then Satan come in and perverted it he said and now he's gotten this I want to speak on it amen perverting theal origal creation of first he said a woman as I said before amen wants to be pretty there's something in her that she is feminist and she wants to be that way but the way they are on this street today amen haircut like a man wearings man's clothes man turned around wearing women's clothes haircut like a woman see it's a perversion the whole thing listen to The Prophet break this down your food is perverted your life is perverted your thirst is perverted listen your desire is perverted he says it's a day of perversion now why is it a day of perversion because there's two spirits that have been released amen that are working in the world today he said one of them is God's holy spirit amen and the other one is the devil spirit amen that is working in deception he said now the people of the Earth are now amen making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ and he is doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her amen for this age showing that it is Christ he said the the holy spirit is here and he is vindicating the message of the hour and the Holy Spirit is doing this amen so that the people that believe God Amen will be called out of this chaos listen the leoan age is an age of chaos that's why the food is perverted that's why the schools are perverted that's why religion is perverted that's why home life and every kind of life around us is perverted he said because the devil's Unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error as usual by perversion of the word of God Amen like he did at the beginning see it coming right back to that seed time again from Eden here it is again let me say this God Amen is the Creator and he is also the Transformer amen but Satan is the perverter and he is also the deformer in Genesis 1 verse one he said in the beginning God Amen created somebody say God created God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth Earth was without form and void amen and darkness was upon on the face of the deep amen but watch this and the spirit of God moved amen the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters now what are Waters a type of according to a prophet the waters are a type of the people amen and that word without form without void and dark it describes a life amen that was without the spirit of God hey but when the spirit of God moved it had the power to transform it amen from a chaos amen into a Garden of Eden he said see that's what we become we become wering Stars away from God without hope without God Amen just turning around out in darkness amen not knowing where we're going now listen friends amen without the Holy Ghost upon your soul amen you are wondering and churning and have no idea where you were going amen and God took that great chaos of darkness and transformed it into a Garden of Eden how did he do it he did it by his word and the same way he transformed the natural Eden is the way he transforms his bride amen is by the word he said now the deformer has took 6,000 years Amen to deform the word amen what has he done amen he has brought hisself into a new type of Eden amen it's Satan's Eden amen that's where we're living today so because we're in Satan's Eden amen the devil the God of this evil age amen is trying to identify amen everybody that's in his Eden is that okay amen he'll try to Define you amen as condemned or serpent seed or amen made too many mistakes or failed go amen the devil's always trying to identify you but let me just say this a Prophet come along and preaches an entire sermon and says identified with Christ he said you know there is in the country today amen so many dissatisfied people he said it's amazing when you get around and you find out so much dissatisfaction people hardly know what they want to do he said they come down the Road about 70 80 M an hour 30 mph Zone amen they slide their brakes turn around the corner he said see seems like people don't know what they want he said now watch if we would go to heaven though and we would meet Abraham we would say Father Abraham what's the greatest thing amen that we could achieve he said the greatest thing we could achieve is life now think about this here is people who have become so dissatisfied amen that they're doing things amen because they have no satisfaction in life which is the greatest thing that a man could achieve let me just say this the reason why they're doing that is because they're living between two desires he said see there is a control tower amen of the soul and one for the body and each Tower is a warning caller for the needs of the other see each one calls to the Need For What the caller is calling for it sends out a wave of warning for instance the flesh amen thirst to satisfy the desires that's in the body amen and the spirit desires the things that's in the soul he said said desire is and many times amen they War one against the other we find there what's a great trouble today is too many people are trying to live between two desires amen for one of them desires the thing of the earth amen and the other desires the thing of Heaven listen the reason why there's dissatisfied people is because some are trying to live in the world and some are trying to live in church amen but let me say this if you're ever going to whip that devil amen Beyond just Sunday morning and Wednesday night you're going to have to cross the line amen between the world and God and take a stand on the word of God and remind that devil I didn't come here amen under some denominational Barnard I come here as a Son of God as a daughter of God I have got a position in the kingdom of God and the devil and all these angels amen can never defeat a son and daughter of God who knows who they are by the word yes sir see the world is full of people that have become dissatis fire with life he said now listen some of them are so Disturbed amen they'll go down the drugstore and they'll purchase a bottle of arsenic or sopic acid amen and commit suicide he said some will turn on their gas jets on in the room or sit in the automobile with a pipe amen for the carbon monoxide amen what are they trying to do they're trying to get away from life now come on I know what I'm talking about amen and the reason they're in that condition is because there's a soul on the inside of every human and there is a thirst in there that God put there from before the foundation of the world to thir after him but the devil and Satan's Eden has perverted that thirst come on let's just go ahead and get it out in the open he ain't no good Devil he's a dirty Devil he's an evil devil he's the kind of devil that'll talk you in the Rob of the bank and then when you go rob the bank he'll call the law on you are you hearing me amen because he is a perverter there is no truth in him but there is a bride in the last days who will return to the full word with the full power and Believe the full Bible and will be transformed into the image that God had of her from before the foundation of the world he said see there seem to be something that they're reaching after amen but they can just never come to it he said now watch this is moved into homes amen which is the backbone of the nation and the church we find homes broke up and divorce courts just overrun with divorces amen juvenile delinquency of mothers leaving their little children with babysitters and taking off out to work some when their husbands got good jobs amen but they're just not satisfied Amen to be a mother and stay at home they're not satisfied to dress like ladies they want to dress like men he said now men wants to be like women and there just seems to be something wrong somewhere and people are reaching for something and they cannot find it amen that's a that's a pitiful condition to be in now look they've looked everywhere now watch this they've looked everywhere to try to find something to make themsel an example he he said see we take men you catch them on the street in their business amen the old man wants to be a teenager so he'll cut his hair off like the flat top and make a ducktail in the back he wants to be a teenager the teenager wants to be like one of these rock and roll Kings where do they wind up in sin and disgrace now listen all this is happening and they're unsatisfied and the whole reason they're in this condition is they have no identification they don't know who they are they don't know where they come from they don't know where they're at they don't know where they're going so anything that comes by they're just going to lend their body too but let me say what Paul said he said if you have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you have been buried in his baptism and you have raised in his resurrection let me say this your life don't belong to you your members don't belong to you if you have taken on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he owns your hands he owns your feet he owns your mouth he owns your body because you are bought by a price I say it's time to come back to the revelation that we are identified Sons and Daughters of God in the word of God yes sir your example let me just say this your example amen it becomes your standard of Life the probably God said take a little boy on the street he said he wants to be a paladin or a Hopalong Cassidy one of these commercial world Amen Roy Rogers or Mr Dylan he said trying to impersonate that person they've set up as an example and they've taken them amen for their standard of life he said where they find out the end of the road he said those little fellas turn turn out to be gangsters and they turn out to be robbers he said the women turn out to be prostitutes amen and Street walking amen and deliquent people let me just goe and preach since I'm this close to it amen I want to say this make sure amen that you know the destination of what's influencing you amen before you give your members to it is that okay amen now look at Marilyn Monroe amen prably God said if I could have got to her amen I could have helped her right amen but what happened she become the standard of what a woman was look at all the sport Stars amen they become a standard amen of what a man is let me say this there is a thirst in the soul of humans amen and that is for an example amen are you with me amen the human wants an example they want to know something that they can identify with that can help them do what they're trying to do listen let me say this don't ever forget though that there's two kinds of examples there's a good example and then there's a bad example every example that comes before you is not a good example the Bible says in 2 Thessalonians 3 in verse 6 Paul says now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye withdraw yourselves my goodness you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us for you yourselves know how you ought to follow us for we behave not ourselves amen disorderly among you look neither do we eat any man's bread for not but rought with labor and travail night and day that we might not be charged of to Any Man of you not because we have not power but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us look at this word in Sample it is of a thing Amen to be imitated or of a thing to be shunned so there are some things amen that you ought to you ought to imitate and there's some things you ought to shine and the Bible goes on to say in 1 Timothy 4:12 Paul writes to Young Timothy and says let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example amen of the belever Bel in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith and in Purity let me just say this those amen that are good examples ought to be followed they ought to be imitated they ought to be replicated amen but if it's a bad example it ought to be shunned and put out of our Lives put out of our homes put out of our families come on church because there's a destination that that example is trying to lead you to let me just say this those amen that did not enter the promised land amen they set forth an example of what unbelief can do in Hebrews 4:11 he said now look let us therefore labor to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief remember man picks this up in the Hebrew series he says what is it amen the pillar of fire is here the angel Lord is with us he's doing the very same things that he said he would do and people stumble around and say oh well I guess it's all right that's pretty good I guess it's okay be careful that you don't fall in the same snare of unbelief you take it with all your heart look at look at Sodom and gomorra amen just a few examples you know what Sodom and Gomorrah become it become an example amen city of what happens when you welcome a spirit of perversion let me just go and preach amen America ought to be able to look back amen and brother brother Joe look back and see what happened to Sodom and gomorra when she opened up and let every Spirit come in amen that is an example Amen in America should have done that thing amen but here we are today and a prophet of God said this nation is so bad amen if he don't judge her the same way he judge them he'll have to raise them up and apologize amen for destroying them look what the Bible says it says in second Peter 26 amen they would turn the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes and condemn them with an overthrow amen making them an example of those that should live after the ungodly Jude 1:7 even as Sodom and Gomorrah and cities round about them in like manner give themselves over to fornication they were going after strange flesh and they are set forth an example amen suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire so in Sodom amen a perverted lifestyle became the example it became the standard it became the plum line he said That's what Satan does he perverts the Nations he perverts the church he perverts the people he is a deceiver he is a perverter of the original truth he said now look the man wears her bangs and she cuts her hair like his and he tries to wear his like hers see what it is what a perversion what an age and listen what a prophet of God said he said oh all these things and don't know it see it is a perfect perverted spirit is in the man so when a man wants to be like a woman it is a perfect perverted Spirit when a woman wants to be like a man it is a perfect perverted Spirit see he is veiled amen from the the lust of Satan and the woman is too what is it it's a satanic Spirit of a Great Society so we've seen what unbelief will do we've seen what perversion will do let's look here at what happened to Lot's wife amen here's an example of what happens when we take our eyes off the word of God and we look backwards in that day he show up on the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away he that is in the field let him likewise not return back now look what Jesus said Luke 17:32 remember remember Lot's wife see brother said see you stay with what's preached to the letter because it will make a difference he said remember Lot's wife she merely looked over her shoulder amen and merely stopped for a moment just like Eve amen but Lot's wife just looked back amen God turned that righteous man lot his wife into a pillar of salt just a little bitty thing just disobeying his commandment enough to just look back and see what all the fire was about but she turned Amen to a pillar of salt and stands there yet today as an example that God means what he says if you ever wonder if God will do what he said he will do amen just look back at Lot's wife amen she's standing there today as an example amen that if you take your eyes off of this gospel plow the Bible said a man that will take his hand off of this gospel plow is not worthy to even hold it I say oh God come down upon this generation and bring back a revelation of identification listen nothing will cause us to turn loose of it amen no depression no condemnation no spirit will ever squash the faith of a believer in the word of God yes sir remember Lot's wife she had a lot more brother said she had a lot more Amen to look back for than what we have let me go on and say this amen but God knowing there would be a thirst in man for an example amen he provided us an example brother Robert our example amen is the perfect example which is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ he's the example of our homes he's the example of our churches he's the example of our families listen there is no other example amen that we should follow amen outside of the Lord Jesus Christ in John 13:15 he said I have given to you an example don't you love that I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you brother said but they are trying to find something now look here they are trying to find something to identify themselves with he said that's the reason they're doing it is because there's something in them that God made them that but God made them an example to be identified with and that was when he made Jesus Christ to become your savior amen that's the example that's what people should want is to be identified with Jesus to be like him Jesus come on the earth he said take my yoke upon you amen and learn of me amen how many wants to learn of Jesus amen take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls look at this word learn it means to understand to be appraised to increase one's knowledge amen look to be learned by use and practice Amen to be in the habit of to become accustomed to in Matthew 16:24 Jesus said If any man will come after me Amen Let Him deny himself amen and take up his cross and follow me so your example the Lord Jesus he said learn of me and then he said follow me in Hebrews 12:2 Paul says looking unto Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God in 1 Peter 2:21 I know I'm reading a lot give me a little bit of Grace okay in 1 Peter 2:21 for even here unto were you called because Christ also suffered for for us amen leaving us an example that we should follow in his steps so our example said learn of me he said follow me he anointed Paul to ride and say look unto him and then he says amen we should follow in his steps can I give you all a little something to remember we are to learn from our example we are to follow our example we are to look unto our example and we are to follow in our example's footsteps and our example is not depression our example is not negativity our example is not leosia our example is not the church down the street or the church up the road amen our example is not the White House amen it's not the Vatican our example is the word of God and we are identified Christians in the word of God I say we ought to get in these books and tapes we ought to break open our Bibles we ought to rise to the challenge of the age and say Satan you might have perverted the world you might have perverted Le the sea but you will not perverse The Thirst that's in my soul I will not follow Hollywood I will not follow education I will not follow Sports CS I will not follow religious CS I am bound to an absolute it's the word of God and I'll follow it in every way I can yes sir yes sir why because the human nature human nature is why there's so many people dis satisfied remember said like this he said they've got a nature that makes them want to have something to identify themselves with I've already said it I'll read it here again he said God made a man to desire to have an example God gave him an example he said now if we'd be more like him there wouldn't be so many big shots in the world well I could preach every while couldn't I there wouldn't be any hungry children in the world there wouldn't be any whiskey or drinking the gambling see now that's what's the matter with the world they got the desire they've got the desire brother kle God has given them that but they've turned it the wrong way but it's time to return back he said it's time to return back and get on the right Road and get facing Calvary nature proves it come on church amen I tell you why sometimes we get real L is we get our eyes off of Calvary let's just be honest we get our eyes off of Calvary and we get our eyes off of the word and we get our eyes off of the Holy Ghost and we get our eyes on this problem and on this change in life and on this situation and we start shifting our focus and before long we start going lower and lower and lower but can I I tell you why because everything outside of Calvary is beneath you so it pulls you down but if you Hallelujah if you can keep your eyes on Calvary Calvary is above your marriage Calvary is above your finances Calvary is above your job Calvary is above everything and if you can just keep your eyes on Calvary it don't matter what you go through Calvary still has the power to pull you out of a bad day it has the power to pull you out of sickness it has the power power to pull you out of depression I say oh God let us get our eyes back on Calvary and remember who we're following Hallelujah there's a cross brother M and it still stands high and it still stands tall you say well there ain't nobody on that cross hey the one that was on that cross is in my heart and he will not lead me to anything outside of what his atonement has provided for me it's time to go back time to go back if they took Christ as their example then we could fire every police there was in the nation yes sir my my my my but what's happened is the world is in an identity crisis now look at this word edti crisis it is a period of uncertainty and confusion in which a person's sense of identity becomes insecure listen it's typically due to a change in their expected aims or role in society so sister Joyce when somebody falls into an identity crisis it's because somewhere something has shifted their focus off of what they should be said like this he said when I was a little boy I read the book of tars and the Apes and Mama had an old rug out there miss walon gave her La before the dresser I cut the thing up and made a tarzen suit and slept in a tree for a week I wanted to be tarzen he said then when I read the book of The Lone Star Ranger I had a broomstick rode around being a hobby horse amen trying to be the Lone Star Ranger he said it's no more than what people do it's what you read come on now it's the music you listen to he said go into a restaurant and this old rock and roll no wonder people are going crazy that's enough Amen to drive a human being crazy so the books we read I'm not trying to be hard I'm just trying to preach something on my heart the books we read the things we watch the music we listen to amen actually becomes influencers over our life and we begin to follow that and people come under that influence and it begins to shape them it begins to mold them into what they want that can I say something amen George Straight has a motive amen for the songs he sings amen amen every rock and roll band has a I don't mean to call names I'm just preaching amen every Elvis Presley he had a motive for every song that he sung what it was was there was a spirit behind it that was trying to become the influence of this age and it succeeded in Elvis's day do you realize today we got 80y old men amen walking around dress like Elvis talk like Elvis amen try to say oh God are you hearing me amen his influence amen did what he intended for it to do amen look he's been gone for years and people still trying to walk around and be Elvis singers you know why because the influence it found somewhere it could get AG G let me just go ahead and say it amen am mean get under country music and before long you'll get so low amen you lost your dog you lost your truck you lost your car you lost your house you lost your wife amen you want to go to we might as well preach amen you want to go to a barroom and get drunk amen it's bringing you into what it desires you to be look at these acds oh God this is on the inter amen look at these hard rockers amen they don't come in amen nice haircut amen well dressed they come in black fingernails black eyelashes black hair black clothes change are you hearing me there's a spirit behind it that's trying to influence your destination I say Church Living God Amen let a boy listen to a song from a country music stong and he wants to be a cloud boy let a let a boy listen to a rock and roll song and he wants to well we might as well bring it on down amen rap ain't no difference am hey come on church amen the things you're listening to amen is bringing you under its influence well Church of the Living God if country music can bring a man under a depression and rock and roll can bring a man under a hateful Spirit what about the songs of Zion that have been sung in this generation I say we ought to climb up out of lay out of sea we ought to climb up up out of this chaos and remember who we are we're not a bunch of Sunday morning Christians we're not a bunch of Wednesday night Christians we are identified Sons and Daughters of God we know who we are Hallelujah we know who we are we know what we're following we know what we're listening to come under the influence of what they read now look in Daniel 9 you all know the Bible says Daniel Amen he read the books of Jeremiah amen and Daniel was a young man who came under the influence of what he read in Jeremiah's books do you know that Solomon knew that the young people were going to be impressionable so in Ecclesiastes 12:1 he wrote to you young people and he said remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them R said oh I read Tarson he said I read the wrong Ranger he said but one day I'll be thankful through all eternity that I read about Jesus Hallelujah and when I read about Jesus look at his words that satisfied me brother Jonah when he read about Jesus it did more than just condemn him it did more than just exciting but it imparted a satisfaction into the control tower of the life of that man let me say to you tonight friends I want to be like him that's my desire that's the kind of example amen that God gave us in Jesus Christ we ought to be identified with him come on that's why I told you amen get your eyes off of the world get your eyes off of the things of leosa and point your eyes back to Calvary the prophet of God said finally one day that's that day at Calvary there was one came down from Glory there was one by the name of Jesus Christ the son of God who came from Glory listen and calary was formed oh Church Amen brother Matt I'll never forget the day God revealed this to me I said over in your living room at the house there in Black Rock Amen the calvary was torn amen and the spirit of the Lord just came by it's been years ago and said these words Calvary is not just a place it's a person I thought oh God Amen it's not about going to the place literal Place brother Benji of calary but if you can get in the presence of the one who hung up on the tree he can do the same thing for you tonight that he did 2,000 years ago he's already done it that's what it was that day count the price was paid the sin question was settled and it opened the way up into this thing that's what we're hungering and thirsting for listen Calvary it brought a place of satisfaction there's no man that ever visits Calvary and sees it the way it was that can ever be the same everything he ever desired to long for is met when he reaches that place it was such an important day and such an important thing it shook the world it shook the world like it was never shook before when Jesus died at Calvary are y'all ready for this and he paid the sin question when Jesus died at Calvary he paid the sin question so what he done was he provided a way for Humanity to be identified in the Old Testament identification was a shadow of the New Testament identification look here with me in the Old Testament when a man wanted to be identified at the house of God look he took the most innocent thing he could find which was a lamb and he know that lamb was free from sin CU it know no sin and he went and took the lamb look and he put his hands upon its head and confessed his sin and by faith he transferred his sins onto the lamb and the innocence of the Lamb came back on him then the lamb died because it was a sinner the man lived by an Act of Faith of obeying what God said now listen but what did he do he went right back out of the temple with the same desire he had when he come in because when the blood cell is broken which Life Starts in one blood cell when that blood cell was broken the life of the Lamb would not coincide or come back into the human life because it was an animal life see the man went out the same desire he had so therefore he committed sins continually all the time again why because the blood of bulls and goats oh Church the blood of bulls and goats amen only provided a temporary satisfaction in other words sister Destiny it just gave him enough to get out the door amen but the desire was still there but Church of the Living God if you can climb up out of the Old Testament and step over in the New Testament there was a place called Calvary and it was not the blood of a bull it was not the blood of a goat it was not a Jewish blood it was not a gentile blood it was the perfect created blood of almighty God can I say this it is not a temporary satisfaction it is an eternal satisfaction if fat blood ever drops on your soul it don't just satisfy you for 5 days or for five minutes It'll seal you until the day of your Redemption I say we welcome the blood of Jesus Christ to come back in the church and Liberate the church from the things of we ought to see and give us a blood identification the Bible said he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him I love what the propag God says he said I was most surely with him at Calvary so I must be identified with him at Calvary I was with him brother Travis I and you were with him at Calvary he said so I must be identified with him at Calvary I must be there to a place we not also I was identified with him at Calvary I died with him at Calvary every Christian Must Die with him at Calvary if you don't die with him at Calvary you can't be none of his I was there when he died I died with him but Church don't leave us there amen and then I was with him when he raised up from the dead brother Carter I was not just with him when he died but I was with him when he raised from the dead B said there come a time when God made an example and he gave us the Lord Jesus listen friends and when a sinner puts his hands upon his precious head and confesses his sins are you all ready for this when a sinner puts his hands upon his precious head and confesses his sins and his sins is transferred from The Sinner to Jesus listen and the innocence of Jesus oh god sister Joyce the innocence of Jesus is transferred by the Holy Ghost amen back onto the person listen that's why it's not a temporary satisfaction it's not the blood of a bull and a goat but it is the Eternal blood when a man lays his hands on the bleeding bloody Lamb of God listen amen amen you want to break out of depression I'm going to give you something to do it with right now you want to break out of condemnation and break out of mistakes and break out of guilt I'm going to give you something right now amen quit identifying yourself with some old Honky Tonk Song quit identifying yourself with some old s five or seven step program and come to the Lamb of God and lay your hands upon his head listen when you lay your hands upon his head you will transfer your sins onto him listen what a prophet of God said and the innocence of Jesus is transferred by the Holy Ghost back into the person he is a new creature in Christ Jesus not he will be not he was he is a new creature in Christ Jesus that's where I want to be identified he knew no sin was made sin for us that's the reason he suffered it's no more than what it was right no more than our duties to look at these things and see that the desires that we have that God put in us to create in us and to make us want to be like him that's a pretty heavy statement that the innocence of Jesus is transferred come on Church the innocence of Jesus is transferred back onto you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost can I just goad and say what a prophet said he come in the visible Union and didn't say you were or you will be he said you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place Church there is a blood and if that blood has come across your life the innocence of Jesus Christ is resting upon you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost quit living in condemnation quit living in the past quit living in yesterday step over underneath the blood there's power in the blood there's Wonder workking power can I say something you might have come in here as condemned as can be and lower than a snake's belly but there is a blood in this building tonight and if you'll come underneath that blood you'll walk out of those doors as innocent as Jesus Christ was what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing nothing but the blood of Jesus Hallelujah somebody shout thank God for the blood thank God for the blood it don't remember yesterday it destroys yesterday [Music] Hallelujah I'm talking about the blood you're perfect the blood of Jesus Christ for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body can I say this to be identified with Christ is to move from dissatisfaction in life to satisfaction in life so satisfaction in life is not based on what you got and what you don't and what you can get and what you can't but true satisfaction is based on one thing the blood of Jesus Christ might say well I'm a Holy Roller Christian down there porest jobes turkey I guess that's the saying out here right poorest job's turkey grw up in Hills East Tennessee here in all time poor is Job's turkey but they're happy you know why they're happy because their satisfaction is not coming from the things around them it's coming from what's in them glory to God are you hear me Church remember what that word satisfied means it means to meet an obligation it means to pay off amen a debt or creditor look what David said he said behold I was shaping iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me can I say this David acknowledges that every human outside of Jesus Christ was born in sin right amen can I say this you were born in debt come on it wasn't when you got old enough and told the first lie you got in debt you was in debt when you broke your mother's womb yes sir come on church I know them little babies amen they're so precious to hold amen but can I say this because of the perverter in the beginning those babies are born in debt but the Bible said amen there was a jubilee year come and people that were sold out for debts they owed they owed a debt and they could not pay it so they went sold themselves to people for slaves and they had to be their slave they bondslave all their life but ever so often there come a day of Grace if there's ever a quote to preaching Grace Tabernacle I think it's this quote right here ever so often brother Morgan there came a day of Grace what was known as the Jubilee year what could happen when he heard the trumpet sound and the slave was made free he could lay down the hole and go home to his children this morning we said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then who will know what to do if the Bible has preached that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead he's the same yesterday today and forever and the trumpets that we're hearing sound today say the days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as Divine Healing who will know how to prepare themselves what we need today amen is some anointed Messengers from God who will stand behind the pull pit and say he is raised from the dead and he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the message of the day oh there's been great messages but Easter capped them all we' sickness healed in Old Testament we seen Miracles performed in the Old Testament there was Visions come in the Old Testament but every man went right to the Grave amen wondering if he would ever rise again but on Easter morning well give me some shouting room on Easter morning when the disciples got the greatest message that any man had ever got what did they get amen go tell my disciples I am raised from the dead amen death has been conquered brother Jaden it ain't you trying to conquer it it's all already conquered I say to you today Grace Tabernacle this is not just a Wednesday night service this is not just little something Amen to get us through to Sunday this is a sounding of the Gospel trumpet it's a jubilee in the house of God it's a day of Grace it's a day of atonement can I say this I don't care what condition you walked in here in I'm sounding the trumpet of Jubilee over your life you can throw down the hole you can throw down the guilt you can throw down the past you can throw down the condemnation there is a blood and it's a glacious blood it's a powerful blood and if a man will come under that blood it'll release him from every guilt it'll release him from every condemnation I'm talking about the resurrection power of the blood of Jesus Christ yes sir anointed Messengers from God who will get behind the pull pit and will fight Devils over you to tell you you're free come on church I say thank God for men of God I say thank God for our pastor thank God for these men of God who will stand behind this pull pit and they see spirits hanging over you they see Devils defeating you they see ideas trying to behind you but they stand there and they keep on Waring and they keep on Waring because they know there is a seed on the inside of that soul and if it just gets under the blood what are you saying preacher I'm saying the gospel trumpet amen declares this the debt has been paid it's satisfied I know what you're saying you're saying I need some proof well when Jesus on Earth he said that he was God he said before Abraham was I am and I am was the pillar of fire that was in the burning bush that spoke to Moses in the day gone by I think that's correct brother veale then he said I come from God and I go through God and when he was crucified he died and he arose and ascended on high and laid his body down upon the great altar of the Eternal God to there ever be present to act in our place friends why are you letting some devil that ain't done nothing for you bind you from serving a God who died for you come on church amen why are you letting some old devil amen bind the way you praise and bind the way you worship he said listen to know that he had paid our sin debt and then he returned back to the Earth again in a form of a great Pillar of Fire let me read you something here in Acts two the Bible says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place look and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind look and it filled it filled all the house where they were sitting there appear them clothing tongues like as a fire and it set upon each of them listen and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost I opened up by saying that a prophet said that the church is losing its identification I opened up by telling you that it's an age where you got the full word you got the full P Bible you got the full power you got a full Square meal you are a full man with a full faith in the Son of God listen church I told you tonight amen that this is not an empty age it's an age of fulfillment look at this and on the day of Pentecost it come down and the pillar of fire amen can you give me that picture the pillar of fire amen it broke apart like that and tongues of fire set upon each of them not their tongues but tongues of fire set upon each of them it was an elected selected group identified by this Pillar of Fire amen showing that God had separated himself into man do you get it amen I'm going to ask you like a prophet said do you get it amen God the L God separate himself into man God not in one person he is in his church Universal that's the reason Jesus said amen the works I do shall you do also in more now the King James says greater but the right translation there is more than this shall you do listen God was bottled and confined in one man Jesus Christ but now he's bottled and confined in the whole universal church amen of the Living God can I say something to you friends can I say something to you that right there amen I'm not ashamed of that picture amen I'll just go ahe and say this I'm going to use it a lot I'm not ashamed of that picture amen because my my thinking has been elevated above the fact there's a human in the picture my thinking has gone above his head and there's a pillar of fire can I say that's the same Pillar of Fire that was with Moses that's the same Pillar of Fire that was with Paul and may I say this on the day of Pentecost that's the same Pillar of Fire are y'all hearing me they were all in the upper room and they were teing and they were waiting for the day of Pentecost to what fully come oh God they were waiting for the fullness of the day of Pentecost they had been there 5 days 6 days 7 Days 8 Days nine days but on the 10th day amen there was a wind coming in the room Prophet God said what was it it was the pit of fire he said it begin to whirl through there and he said it begin to break apart and a lick of fire went in there and a lick of fire went in there and before long 120 amen were full of the pillar of fire well may I say to you tonight come on church amen can I say to you tonight amen if you buy something and you own something if you want to keep it you better get you a receipt you better get you a proof of purchase you better get something more than I think I paid for it I remember what I was wearing when I paid for it come on Church you better get something that when the Devil comes knocking you can say devil right here's my receipt may I say to you tonight amen if you are a born again son and daughter of God who has been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ you have heard the trumpet sound youve received the Jubilee you're in a day of Grace that is more than a picture that is your receipt to show the devil that the God who died is the god who's in my soul he's come back in this generation and veiled himself in my flesh to say Satan the dead is paid for listen I won't pay for it no more it's already paid for my sins were paid for at Calvary my iniquities were paid for at Calvary there is a blood it's a powerful blood it's a blood that goes beyond the way you feel it's a blood that goes beyond the way I think come on it's an eternal blood what are you saying I'm saying this God has a satisfying portion what is that satisfying portion said the Lord Jesus has lotted for us the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm just going to take a few minutes here and close it and knock that devil square in the face devil says well is it the will of the Lord I have the Holy Ghost how many times I meet people that's prone to be a little nervous when they find out they're trying to do something and everything's just blocking it off on both sides they say well you know it might not be the will of the Lord see now don't let the devil lie to you like that the first thing is find out whether it's the will of God or not and then if you want to know whether it's the will of God look in the Bible there is the thing that sets you straight is the word of God and then if you see it's in the word of God for you to do it like for instance watch how he turns this see seeking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost many times I run into people and they say well I've sought for the Holy Ghost I just couldn't receive it I don't believe it's for me every time I get down I get sick and I go to pray and if I fast I get sick if I try to stay all night I stay up I get so sleepy I can't get off my feet remember that's the devil because God intends for you to have the Holy Spirit it's for whosoever will many times you find when you're prayed for in a meeting for Divine Healing then the next day you find out no doubt that the devil will make that twice as bad as it was the day before can I can I preach to you see remember remember that's just Satan trying to get you away from the blessing that God's got for you see don't you listen to that fell see always press right on remember last time I spoke to you amen the brides break through you got to press you got to press beyond the way you feel you got to press beyond the mistakes you've got to press beyond the S come on and intellectual Powers Will Never Move you but when you come to power of the Resurrection The only thing to satisfy amen amen can I have five minutes here the only thing to satisfy amen that longing is to find the reality of what you're longing for come on church if you set out to find something sister lilan you're gonna find it are come on guys amen amen you're looking for a certain bowl or a certain type of H hunting equipment you're going to set out to find it you're going to find the reality listen I'll say this the queen of the South she heard of the wisdom of Solomon and she traveled through dangers because she knew it was God's will to see that the Bible said the wise men they came from the east of Jerusalem saying where is he that's born the king of the Jews we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him brother said if you long to see that Jesus if something makes you long to see Jehovah he's somewhere or you would never have that longing you got a longing to be in Victory you got a longing to walk in power you got a longing to walk in reality listen if there was not somewhere for you to walk in it their desire would not be there but God oh God but God is just just as good to you as he is to the wise men or to anyone if you long for him blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be brought somebody shall they say they shall be brought they shall be brought to the Fountain where they can drink the satisfying portion can I just say something to you the condition the devil got you into is not your destination can we just get that out there the condition the devil got every one of us into is not our destination y'all remember brother Bram goes in the midal institution he walks in there and he begins to look around and he says who am I going to start with remember that he said who am I going to start with and he said there was a young girl sitting over there and she raised her hand she said well brother bam start with me he said start with you he said a pretty girl like you what are you doing in here and brother bam said she began to tell him her story how how she did this and she did that and how got her so condemned until the point she lost her mind remember that b said I walked over there and he said I got down whether or not be to pray she got up she said brother Brandon she said feel better now it's going to be different he said no you'll just turn leaf and go back the same way you were before brother said listen let's get down and pray listen what he says he said and we got down and prayed and he said she began to pray he said and before long she prayed through to the satisfying portion come on church she prayed through to the satisfying she didn't just pray through to a feeling she didn't pray through till she thought it was better she prayed through until she got her eyes on Calvary and realized the God that was on Calvary had come right there in that middle hospital and he was there to do something for her said today she's married got three or four children what was it she took God and she stayed with it till actually something happened he said what happened the Living Word become a living reality to her and when God plants his promise in you it becomes a living reality then something is different you don't go and say yes I believe it the devil believes it like that but it's confirmed to you and the word becomes alive in you then you begin to see what it is when the word becomes alive in you the living word becomes a living reality and that's your identification church then you begin to see what it is let our musicians come tonight Abraham Our Father the Bible says in this Hebrews 11:8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went now look by Faith by faith he sojourned the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise listen what the Bible says for he looked for a city for he looked yes sir for a city which had had foundations whose Builder and maker is god brother comes along says oh my how that steel comes down through his children that strain is looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God another place we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are HS according to the promise there you are and that brings not in our bodies we are Gentiles in our bodies we are sinners in our bodies but in our souls we being born again with the same Spirit was upon faithful Abraham that strained down in there that's why you can't get away from it you may try but you can't because whatever was in Abraham is in you whatever was in Abraham is in you listen brother Robert why are you sitting here tonight because whatever was in Abraham was in your soul and it was looking for a city whose Builder come on church amen it went beyond the ideas of a church it went beyond the traditions of religion there was something in you that was longing for the reality listen you wanted to hear more than just a sermon about heaven you wanted to hear more than just an idea about the Rapture you wanted somewhere you can Fellowship listen our satisfaction is coming from the identification we're Rapture Ready sister Debbie it don't make no difference what the devil does let him do what he wants to these bodies but there's a soul brother Benji he can scare that flesh all he wants to but there's a soul in there and the devil can't scare that soul I say there's a strain in there listen the Devil Couldn't scare Abraham away from the promise that there was a city whose Builder and maker was God and there's a gentile bride with a Seed of Abraham who the devil can't scare neither so what did Abraham do amen Amen Let me let me just finish reading this he says that strain in there makes us want to trust God but the body gets scared oh if we're the children of Abraham let's be as Father Abraham was what are you saying preacher I'm saying this Abraham walked in one day brother Matt and he said Sarah we're moving out where are we going we're selling everything we got we're going looking for a city we're going looking for a city now now now just imagine Sarah had her tent all set up everything in there she wanted everything just right everything in place and Abraham comes in says we're leaving it well where we going something better oh yeah where are we going we're going to set out to find the city see there was a desire brother Matt there was a thirst in his soul there's a city somewhere I'm going to go find it do you realize Abraham was a pilgrim and a stranger and he walked by faith for years you know the Bible records that Abraham never saw that City you imagine he gave his whole I'm preaching to you now he gave his whole life away he gave Sarah's house away he gave everything away and he set out to find a city whose Builder and maker was God and he never found it but a Prophet come along and said one day he went down there when he heard lot was captive he went down there and delivered his his nephew lot and they come walking back and on their way back the Bible says God came down and spoke a body into existence called mzc and stepped in that body and served Abraham his Victorious child communion can I tell you where he served that to him at brother Robert the prophet of God said he Abraham served mzc or rather MDC amen served Abraham communion in the literal spot I feel like dancing on that one in the literal spot where that City he was looking for would come down Church of the Living God may I say this amen there's a Rapture upon the church there's a resurrection upon the church there's a body change get your eyes off the world get your eyes off the leot get your eyes off the problems and Look Away to Jesus look away to the cross again look away from the negative look away from the sin let me just say this to you repent of the thing put it under the blood and put your marching shoes on and walk like a Seed of Abraham walk like a daughter of God won't you stand to your feet tonight [Music] quit letting everything identify [Music] you come on church people said you ain't good enough it didn't stop you can I just say it because what you say about us don't identifies we know who we are we've been underneath the blood said Abraham met him and took Community right there on the literal spot where that City will be raised up in other words he never saw the city but he stood where it would be in the literal spot can I say to you what the Bible says the Bible says blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall they shall be filled now what is there here tonight 4550 5560 a lot of people here tonight and every single one of you can leave here fi you know that every Brother Kyle every individual can leave here tonight full you know why because in that day there shall be a fountain open in the House of David God's the one that can quien your nerves God's the one who can give you that satisfying portion that's his spirit the reason that you do things is because you're substitute in those things for the real thirst that God put in you for the Holy Ghost but oh come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden I'll give you rest see he's the Fountain of Life my expression of Jesus Christ he's the ex inexhaustable Fountain of Life that a man May drink and be satisfied that's what you're made like that for that's why you got that thirst in you and then if he can't make you drink the doctors can scare you to death of cancer in the throat from a cigarette then he'll let you join a church now watch this brother B said the devil will let you join a church and go ahead if he can't get you with drinking and he can't get you with smoking then he'll just let you join a church and just go ahead living for the world he still got you you're not still satisfied there cannot be a satisfaction outside of the new birth a man was made for that God made you that way and you'll never be satisfied until you quench that thirsty with the Holy Spirit when you take one drink from that Fountain Church how many drinks does it take one drink

perfect love cast out fear amen you I believe that I believe that it don't it's a perversion where did sickness come from say it was a perversion of the creation that God Made You know what else there ain't nothing that Satan has ever made or or perverted that has a right to stay in our life tonight but in the middle of this atmosphere I can say Vision can't stay any longer cuz perfect love cast out fear unsettledness can't stay any longer cuz perfect love cast out fear it doesn't matter what it is depression it can't stay any longer spiritual Brokenness it can't stay any longer cuz perfect love cast out fear do you believe that tonight amen I believe it I believe it's God's word and I believe we have a right as a body of Believers to stand upon God's word I know Satan don't want us to hear it and you know what sometimes it just takes the Lord to come by and remind us of who we are and pick us up out of this Condition it's so easy because the circumstances of this life it keeps us unsettled but you realize that there's nothing in this life that will ever bring you peace can I say something to you tonight that'll help you there's no there's no wealth that'll ever bring peace you'll never in this life ever have peace if you had perfect health if all your children were perfectly well if everybody had perfect health you had perfect money you didn't have no bills you had no trouble you would still have no peace upon this Earth butram said there ain't no peace there's no Eternal peace there's no Eternal happiness unless you're anchored in Christ Jesus he said because God would never allow you to have perfect peace on this Earth because you would get comfortable in this world and God don't want you comfortable in this world but he wants you to find comfort in Jesus Christ and Christ Alone therefore in this earth in the things of this world you will never have peace you'll never it'll always be some kind of unsettlers and I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow if everything was going to be well you'd still be worried about what was going to happen tomorrow you'd be worried about your kids whenever they left the house you'll always be worried in this world because you'll never find peace in this world he said but the only peace we have is in Christ Jesus therefore when that unsettledness comes around and this Spirit begins to to come around and this oppression comes on us you say I don't find peace here anyway my peace is in the word of God I'll never find peace in this earth my peace is in Christ Jesus and In Christ Alone he said therefore he said a real born again Christian will always have an eternal peace in his heart because our peace is not found in this world it ain't in this life but I thank God we have a real peace do you believe that tonight you're always going to have unsettling in your spirit Spirit don't look at what's going on around and the circumstan and the things that's taking place in our life but when you're troubl in your spirit look back to the Peace of Jesus Christ and say but in that I have peace I've I've lost but in that I have peace I'm troubled in my spirit but in that I have peace I failed but in that I have peace I don't know what tomorrow holds but in that have I have peace I don't know if I can make it through tomorrow but in him I have peace that's our real peace tonight do you believe that tonight are we Believers amen I believe that tonight I believe we have a right to turn to it the Peace of the Cross of Calvary brother Andrew said that here was what we were called to come to to learn from to look to and to follow Jesus Christ isn't that our calling tonight we don't rely upon this flesh and the feelings and isn't it so easy to be to be led by the feelings of our flesh but I thank God that he's given us something because we are flesh and but he's a merciful god and he looks at our flesh and the weakness of our flesh and he gives us a way by by the spirit of God to overcome the feelings of this flesh I thank God for it that's the only thing that can come and and bring peace whenever we're troubled isn't that right sister Sandy is he a is he a peacemaker isn't that right is he a peacemaker can somebody testify over tonight say brother Matt that's right he's a peacemaker do you feel that you feel that that Spirit lift that the heaviness just to lift off of you just for saying Lord I accept that you're a peacemaker and I need it Lord we need it tonight I need it I I need to go through another day I need that in my life he's a peacemaker he's a Creator and that Creator God he said he gave you he gave you the ability the power as a Believer as the Bride of Jesus Christ because he's a creator he gave you the voice of creation that you could create an atmosphere you say brother Matt what kind of atmosphere the atmosphere of Peace that's what's taking place in this meeting tonight is when the word of God has gone forth it's an atmosphere of Peace that's been created I don't know about you but I want to live in it Lord let me look past every trouble Lord I Thank you for the peace you've given me Lord I Thank you for the trials I thank you for the the heartache and the the things that I've gone through Lord because it it's caused me to a Believer lord it's caused me to turn to you it's caused me to to hold on that much more You' strengthened me in my walk by my own failures and mistakes and and circumstances that I've gone through and you've gave me the peace to be able to get through it he's that kind of a god do you love
