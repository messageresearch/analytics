that's said and done we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen may God bless you tonight we just want to invite you to the scripture we're going to read out of the Book of Matthew and in the fifth chapter would us read in the 38th verse Matthew 5 and 38 or excuse me be the 48th verse we'll just read one verse of scripture there Matthew 5 you a moment just to get there just been feasting all week the word of God just to be able to see the things that God is doing Among Us the many Souls that have been saved and people just drawing closer to God lord Just DE your heart it's something whenever you know these brothers ministers can tell you it's just a real special thing when God gives you a word you know when you're looking Lord just settles your heart and but I believe that we come to hear from the Lord tonight amen I I could tell you everything I know You' leave here and you wouldn't be any better off than you were when you came but one word from the Lord could change so we just want to give the Lord the Liberty to speak so I want to read this one verse of scripture as you take your seats Matthew 5 48 Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word I want to speak tonight on this subject of growing into Perfection growing into Perfection here this uh this scripture that that Jesus was speaking is it's quite it's quite a demand for the church isn't it when you read that it's such a that's that's an overwhelming thought what a thought it is to be a perfect Christian or or a perfect person or to be able to stand perfect before God or or to even be perfect before one another and you know there's there's something there's something about this word perfect that that that means that to have all the required or desirable elements or characteristics or or qualities or in other words it means to be good as it is possible to be and I I know that many they they strive to be that way and we strive for one another to meet this place of perfection and I thought it's something about this word perfect how that we look brother Morgan at one another and many times this is something that we demand of one another we demand uh Perfection we demand you not to make any error we demand our our loved ones and our in our in our church our brothers and sisters in church and we we demand that that they always carry their yourself in the right way and they always say the right thing at the right time and they never make any mistakes or or never fall or they never get upset or they never get angry or they or they always always display the love of God and so uh it's something that we demand of one another often times and and I thought but you know to be a perfect Christian or a perfect person it could only be measured by the standard of the one that you're trying to be perfect for see so if I would let's say if I if I was building a building or had you build a building and you went out and you constructed that a way uh that would meet the eye of of of the the master builder the contractor maybe a builder would come by and brother Adam you did all the fine work and you framed it up just right and and you you did it all according to what you would consider to be a perfect house and and maybe the the contractor would come by and say well I don't like it that way see because you know I like it to have a the curve in the roof and I like I I like the the pillars to be round and I like that that the colonial look and and everything in here square and there's too many corners and there's too many windows or there's not enough windows or the floor is the wrong color see and and so they'd come by and one person may say it's perfect and the other person says it's terrible I wouldn't even live there you couldn't you couldn't give me that place to live and see so you find out that even Perfection it has to be measured uh by the standard of the person that you want to be perfect for so in other words so if I would say to you to be perfect then you would have to ask a question you would say by what standard must I be perfect if I said you need to live a perfect life or have a a perfect testimony your next question would always be well by what standard I I got to thinking about this if our if if if it's a call to Perfection by what standard is God calling us to be perfect and I I thought you know it's something that even in the church World you'll never find perfection if you if you was a Catholic the Baptist would say the Catholic is never a perfect Christian or the or the Baptist would say the Catholic is never a perfect Christian but you realize that in order to be a perfect Baptist that you would it would have to be by a Baptist standard in order to be a perfect Catholic it would have to be by Catholic standard to be a perfect Pentecostal it had to be by a Pentecostal standard and so so you find out it's according to the standard that you're measuring by so so you see to be a perfect Christian would have to come from a Christian standard there had to be something that God if he's going to call us to a place of perfection then there would have to be a standard that God was going to measure Us by butram said see if God is going to bring people to judgment he's going to have to have something to judge them by he's got to have some standard there there's got to be something that God was use as his standard he said see so if God would judge the world he said he would judge the World by Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the word and the word is God and he will judge them by this Bible for this is his word and it's God's standards so we must measure up to what the Bible says that we ought to be so see if God is going to have a standard and if God is going to call you to be perfect then there has to be a standard there has to be something that God would judge you by I thought my I got to thinking about this Bible standard tonight and the more I thought about it the more I thought about the measure me in Rod of the word and what we would measure up to and how we would fit into the standard of God and and the more I thought about it the more I I kept feeding and thinking you know that this Bible standard that God would give us that it's not a standard of legalism many would take it and say well if there's a standard in the Bible then it must be some bylaws or something that we have to live by in order to be perfect to God but the more I read and the more I studied you find out that God's Bible standard it wasn't a it wasn't a standard of a book of laws his Bible standard wasn't a standard of legalism said he said it like this he said see we've got laws and we make bylaws he said and you don't measure if you don't measure up to the standard then men will say well I've got a religious measuring stick that you have to measure up to and if you don't measure up to that then you just can't come in he said but God Saves Us by Grace not by a measuring stick so see if God is going to give us a standard to live by and God is going to give us the Bible and the Bible is going to be a Bible standard you know what that tells me that this Bible standard ain't a legal standard it ain't a it Ain it ain't that kind of a standard it ain't a standard of legalism but it's a Bible standard is a standard of the grace of Jesus Christ the Bible standard it's a standard of God oh I think about how he said see the perfecting of the Saints this is what God is calling us too and the more I thought about this standard of Grace you realize that the perfecting of the Saints is not something that we demand but it was something that God demands and not only did God demand the perfecting of the Saints but God you see if God would demand something then God's going to provide a way for you to get it so if he would demand the perfecting of the Saints and he would provide a way for it to be achieved this is what he said in Ephesians fourth chapter he said and God gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure or the stature of the fullness of Christ I thought isn't it something that God would send a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of God's children that would meet the demand of God that was a call to the church to be a perfect church he said that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine but by the slide of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love that we may grow up into him all things things which is the head even Christ Jesus from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint Supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love I'm going to read that out of an amplified Bible so you can catch it he says for because of him the whole body the church and all of its various parts are closely joined together firmly knitted together by the joints and ligaments which is applied by God when each part is working properly it grows to full maturity and builds itself up in love this is the call of God to the church today that we grow together in the spirit of unity that we grow that we take the word of God and we would fit in it and and we' take the joints that God would Supply isn't it something that to build the body of Christ he'd Supply every part he'd Supply every knat every joint every ligament every turn every corner every speaker every singer every part that anybody would play that God would Supply let me tell you what that means to me tonight church that the church has what she needs you say what are we if we're looking for healing she has what she needs if she's looking for a Revival she's got what she needs if she's looking for salvation she has what she needs they're God Will Supply everything that the church has need of tonight that every joint be supplied This Is Our God he gives the church what we have need of but said you notice those people they can sit and say well I'll accept the Lord he said you take their word for it because you can't judge and neither can I he said but you'll notice in 10 years from now they never progressed they stay right where they are they're right in the same old place he said but we ought to grow daily in the grace of God we ought to grow each one each day our heart would hunger we ought to keep moving on there's something growing on the inside of you you get bigger and more spread out you can take more because you're you're bigger and you're growing and you're growing closer to God he said when this is what Paul said he said you're maturing to the Corinthian Church he said you're you're maturing and growing but when you ought to be teachers you're still babes needing teaching he said they ought to be teachers but there's something in there that is growing out and pushing out and making them bigger it's the Holy Spirit that's growing I thought isn't it something he said but you ought to be you ought to be teaching but you still need taught I thought isn't this something to hear if God is putting a life in you and that life is going to go or grow brother Adam I thought about how that a natural life in in a body and how if that if that you take a child that's born and as long as everything it's being fed right and it and it's being nurtured and and it's been given the right right food food and and it's in in in in the in the most rugged of atmospheres I've been all over the in many countries and and seen the poverty at its highest level over in India where there's so much poverty that they barely have any food to eat but you realize that the children the most malnourished children in the world but they they still grow is it something they don't they don't all have the Bountiful food that every other country has but they're still growing even with a little bit of food because your body is made to grow it's designed to grow it's not designed to stay an infant it's not designed to stay in this stage of infancy and this is what Paul is teaching with the body of Christ it can't remain an infant but it has to come to a growth it it has to come to a place of maturity so if there's a life in you and that life is living hear me somebody then you must be getting bigger if that life in you if it's alive if there's a life in there if there's a life form somewhere then it has to be growing it don't matter if it's natural or if it's spiritual it has to be growing brother typed it with a new birth he said if a birth is born it's born from the inside out that's why you never try to make a Christian from the outside end like these people do and they they put all these laws on people and and if you'll do that well you'll be saved well it never saved anybody but it takes a life on the inside of a person that would change a person's heart and it would push out the very Life of Christ he said see this life in you is growing it's getting bigger it's a new birth he said and when this birth is on the inside this is a question brother brandom asked he said when a birth is on the inside should it not grow if it's a birth on the inside shouldn't It Grow the Christ in your heart it ought to be growing daily it ought to be getting bigger it ought to be more powerful you ought to understand things better you ought to be more forgiving you ought to be walking as God would because the Bible said Till Christ be formed in you is the Hope hope of all glory we're waiting on it to grow he said therefore we must contend with the weak until they are fully matured in Christ Jesus contend with one another they may not be where you are but contend with one another until they're fully matured in Christ Jesus then they're good soldiers then they've got on the full armor and let me tell you what happens when they get to that place you can talk about them and it don't even matter amen somebody you can make fun of them and it don't even affect them you can laugh at them they don't pay no attention to it cuz they're at a stage of maturity he said the one thing I know he said they've got one thing they're just so big they're so filled with the glory of God that the only thing it would take for them to go in a Rapture is this old flesh to fall off of them and that old robe of Flesh and they'll go right into Glory cuz they've done built on everything they have need of has already been built on the inside of them the only thing keeping you as that old robe of Flesh that's hanging there I pray to God that every believer under my voice tonight would be so filled with the glory of God that the only thing left for a Rapture is to drop off this old robe of Flesh and take another step into eternity lay down the robe of Flesh we ought to be so fat in the word of God we ought to be growing out it ought to be pushing out of us there ain't no life left in US it ain't nothing but God growing out I think the problem with the church well today is the churches are too skinny they they're anemic on the word of God but I thank God we have a fat church I thank God that we've been feeding on the word of God enough that it's pushing something out of us all the world has gone by the wayside and the life of Jesus Christ is being manifested in the heart of every believer amen we ought to be a fat church we ought to be a big church we ought to be big Christians amen we ain't a bunch of little pushovers we're big Christians thank God for it glory to God my he said well what's a big person look like let me just tell you he said a big person when somebody come by and they say you know Miss Jones somebody called you a hypocrite she said well they did well God bless them that's what a big person looks like well you know certain things going on with the church that ought to be going on well it is well we'll just pray for them that's what a big person looks like but said that's big he said oh if you're little you'll say oh it is but let me see which side I must join oh it is there's a problem did you believe what so and so said oh they did but let me tell you what this one said about oh it did let me tell you what side I'm going to join he said see that's where you get in trouble where you can't mature but the big person they look a little different man I feel like preaching he said when you get big enough when you get large enough how many wants to hear it when you get swelled out and and not just swelled out but growed out Christ growing in you it'll grow out all malice it'll take you out of you it'll push it out and when God comes in it'll push everything out you say oh how little how juvenile it is for these kids to argue in fuss he said but the first thing you know you'll just grow over the top of it they may argue they may fuss they may be playing Church they may not be ready to have church there may be all kinds of things going on down there but there's something about the big Christians that it don't vect them any longer why they're living in a place that's above it he said we wer called to be little we were called to be big said you then you'll say I used to hate to see this and hate that he said but you know I just got so I don't pay attention to it anymore he said now you're growing I just don't pay attention to it no more that's big you know sometimes when you grow sometimes it hurts to grow take a little kid and some of you little boys may be going through it right now go in bed at night and get to that age of growing and your legs hurt so bad and your arms start hurting scientist still ain't yet figured out how or why why it even happens but but it's somehow associated with adolescence and their growth and but but but every one of us go through that growing pains and each one of us as a Young Man a young woman it went through growing pains and you know it's just it's not a it's not a bad thing it's just a sign that you're growing you'll feel them one day now don't worry but it's just a sign that you're growing it's a she's got the genetics of her daddy bless her heart but it's a sign that you're growing that they're growing pains and sometimes you know it just means you're getting bigger it may be a little bit at a time but it means you're getting bigger you know your arms hurt your legs hurt all these things you're getting bigger all the time but you realize but that's the way it is when you're serving God sometimes it hurts a little bit when you grow sometimes when the preacher goes to preach and they'll step on your toes why because it's God just trying to grow you into a big Christian sometimes it feels like a whole sermon was just directed at you but don't worry about it it's just God trying to grow you into a big Christian but let me tell you something tonight Church that your response to the word of God it shows the maturity of where you are so let the word go forth and let the maturity of the believer say Amen anyhow well I got news for you a real mature Christian they don't have to know everything that's where men have messed it up well if they're going to be a mature Christian they got to be able to quote all the scripture no that ain't it to be a mature Christian you got to know the church age book front to back no that ain't it but free to be a to be a mature Christian they might not even have the answer to the question correctly ly but what they will do is they'll respond to the word correctly that's a sign of the maturity of a Believer so when the preaching of the word makes you feel good you say amen and you go forward when it steps on your toes you say amen and you go forward when it makes you feel bad you say amen and you go forward when it corrects your mistake you say amen and you go forward when it's straight you say Amen when it's hard you go forward why it's the sign of the maturity of the Christian church I know what the devil does he says who are you to correct me I'm an elder anyhow I got news for you friends I don't want to correct anybody I I ain't never in my life ever woke up thought well I'm gonna go set them straight I don't have that I don't want to correct people I don't want to get on to my my little my little nephew he he told his mama the other day he said you know I want to when I grow up I want to be a pastor and she said well why you want to be a pastor he said so I can tell everybody what to do I she said why would he think that I don't know I hope I don't go around trying to tell everybody what to do but that hopefully that ain't what what everybody looks at a pastor as I don't want to correct anybody if I if I was going to correct everybody well I'd start with myself that' that'd be where I'd start but I thought my instead of worrying about who's correcting and who's preaching and what and what they're saying is it directed at me and what what's God trying to do you see the atmosphere that's been in the church in the past past few weeks and months it's the unity of Jesus Christ to a place where the word of God can go forth and God can take any vessel that God chooses and let him establish him in the pull pit and and let him let him be able to surrender to God without somebody pulling on them and talking and causing all this trouble and allow God to come and be able to speak to the hearts of the Believers that we can be big Christians let them come and speak the word of God I think what we ought to do is just let the word be preached and correct all of us I think we ought to just let the word be preached and fix all of us then we can be right before God we ain't trying to correct nobody we just want let God have his way you know sometimes sometimes we have to be big enough to do little things my we're going to be a big Christian sometimes you gotta be big enough to do little things I know brother brother Joe won't mind if I share this but I remember when he first came to the church and here you know the church was growing brother Joe the Lord had spoke to him and told him to come here and be a help and he whenever he came to tell me that he said you know brother Matt he said Lord told me to come and be a help my family and we're going to we're going to get behind the work here and and put our shoulder to the wheel and this is where God's called us to and he said Lord Lord told me to Lord told me to do it he said so if you need me to lead songs I'll lead songs if you need me to take prayer requests I'll take prayer requests if you need me to preach I'll preach if you need me to to sing after I'll sing after whatever you need me to do just let me know I just want to be a help I thought isn't that the right way to come Lord just let me be a help in any way that I can let me be a help I thought you know that's a big thing for a man to say brother is older than I am he's been preaching longer than I have but you know instead of instead of positioned himself as an elder or try to you know to position in some way he just said Lord called me here and I want to be a help I thought you know the lord lord gave something to my heart that day I thought you know if you're too big to do the little things you're too little to do the big things and I thank God that we have people that are big enough to do little things I thank God for people that are big enough to say whereever I'm needed just let me be a help and let me let me be a feeling if I got to be a f in I just want to be a help in the house of God I want to do my part that God's children can go on and then we can be big Christians and one day we'll go into a Rapture that's the opposite of the way the world thinks isn't it something that's opposite of the way they think but you know what they got to be you got to be big enough to be little I know it's so opposite you got to be big enough to be humble you got to be big enough to be a servant you got to be big enough to surrender to God but BR said listen he said notice always a big man always humbles himself the Way Up Is Down always make yourself little God will bring you up he exalts himself and shall he that exalts himself shall be a based but he that humbles himself shall be exalted he says so make yourself little always be little don't be the big shot or be the little fella God is the only one Among Us that's big anyhow isn't that right he's the only big one there is anyhow he said you always say people are looking to have a holy church and a holy people he said oh no it's the holy God that's right we're an Unholy church and an Unholy people we ain't no such thing as a holy church it's a holy God in the church there ain't no such thing as a holy people it's the holy ghost in the people so then you're not talking about the people any longer but you're talking about the Holy Ghost that is in them God's Building A Perfect Church oh I know what people quote the scriptures well I'm a you know after all the B my good I'm gonna get myself in trouble after all the Bible said I'm a king and a priest and and after all the Old Testament said I was to be the head and not be the tail and and you know I'm supposed to be a great man like David and and Samson these Mighty Warriors and and my I want to have the faith of Abraham and the courage of David and the and the resolve that that Daniel had and the strength of Sam Samson and and the vision of Deborah and the patience of Martha and the dedication that Esther had I want to have all those things I say amen amen amen and amen but how about what Paul said he said we need to have the mind of Jesus Christ we can have all those things but Paul said but we must have the mind of Christ he said let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God most people stop right there thought it not robbert to be equal with God man I'm a great big man not thought it not robbery to be equal with God but listen to the rest of the scripture he said but he made himself of no reputation and he took upon him the form of a servant and he was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross it was a big man that became little you realize this was Paul's message in Philippians the second chapter to each one of us he said but in the lowliness of mine Let each esteem other better than themselves I'm showing you how to get big look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others now notice what God did he said wherefore then after all of this he said wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that in at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of the things in heaven and the things in Earth and the things under the Earth and that every tongue con should confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord the glory of the God the father isn't it something listen friends he humbled himself unto greatness this is our Jesus he surrendered himself to Victory this is our Jesus he gave his life gave up all that he was yet he gained the whole world that's our Jesus our example humbled himself unto greatness he became our example in all things do you realize everything that we do in the church today the very Commission of the church today came from Jesus Jesus being our example I thought of a few things that we do that how how we go down and we baptize people and you realize that we baptized because Jesus was baptized see he's our example if we come out and and and we we come to communion we take communion because Jesus Took communion he was our example we wash feet because he washed feet see he was our example even when we come up and and you bring a baby up to be dedicated and and we come you realize we don't you know many places they put sprinkled water or something on the babies but we don't do that we come and we lay hands on a baby and pray over them and speak over their life it's a dedication but said see what we do he said we want to stay exactly the way the Bible said to do it he said there's no scripture for baptizing an infant or nothing like that he said so but notice what Jesus done see because Jesus was our example that he brought him the little children and he put his hands on them and he blessed them he said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of heaven and that's the way we try to continue see Jesus is our example so why don't we baptize why don't we was feet why don't we take communion why don't we dedicate babies there's your answer Mama that you were looking for why why do we go through this because Jesus was our example and we're following after our example I found that I thought this is a beautiful quote I may take it just a second and read it he said now we know as the pastor and I lay hands on these babies our hands are poor substitutes for our Lord because his was holy but if he had to search to the Earth this morning to find a holy hand where would he find it there is no such thing on the Earth but by his Grace we represent him see if he's our example sister Joy then we must be like him he's our example we must be like him but man said wouldn't it be nice if we were all like him he said well what was it to be like him he was always about his father's business so if he's going to be our example it wouldn't it be something if we were just about our father's business see then whenever things came up it didn't bother him it didn't sway him because it was about the father's business see when somebody's on a mission or they're or they're going about some business they're they're harder to distract see you come up and say well there's such and such going on and and my it ought to it ought to distract the whole church but there's somebody that's just about the father's business why don't that get you so worked up and and don't you know don't you know you ought to be mad about that well I can't help it right now because I'm about the father's business say see because we got something else on our mind there's a mission on our mind I thought my isn't it something he gave us an example he said so remember our Lord what would he do if he stood here today he would hold to the word of God in the midst of every temptation he'll say with the word just like he did it he was your example what are you going to make for your example think about it who's your example he said he ought to be our example who's your example tonight have you made some some some movie star our example is it is it some bull rider that that that that has become our example is it a great athlete or somebody that's become our example brother said are we going to make Hollywood our example or you just going to believe God's word about it Jesus Christ our example notice if he's our example let's just see what the Bible said our example did can I have a minute the Bible said after the Holy Ghost fell on him he went into the Wilderness and he was tempted to be tempted of the devil then was Jesus listen then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil a't that something he was led of the spirit to be tempted he was led to be tempted watch what Satan done he waited until he got the weak State I love how Jesus done this he fasted 40 days and 40 nights until a man's body his natural body would get into a condition that was the weakest state that a human being could be in to show you that in your weakest Place how that you could defeat the Devil so here in this weakened state after 40 days of fasting and in this we he was already in human flesh the Lord Of Glory that that that descended into human flesh and and he and he came down into this weak old frail body that falls apart anyway then he went down and he fasted until he his body was so weak that he was laying there he could barely even it could barely even move but he was in this wicked State and then Satan comes by and he begins to tempt him thought is it something when he when he lead him I thought that was just something how that was worded how that he was led to be tempted isn't it something that he was led to be tempted but then when Jesus would tell us how to pray the Lord's Prayer the disciples said how must me pray he said we'll say F Our Father Who Art in Heaven lead us not into tempt ation but delivers from Evil I thought isn't that something Jesus the Bible says he was led to be tempted he was our example he said but when you pray you pray father don't lead us into temptation thought isn't that an odd thought even in the garden whenever he would pray in the garden Matthew 26th chapter the Bible said when Jesus went down to pray he began to call upon them that Temptation wouldn't come on I'm going to show you the answer to this why why it seems like he would be one way and he' tell you to pray another but notice what Jesus actually says he says he never says Watch and Pray so that you won't be tempted he says see see see there's no way you can get to a place in your Christian walk that you're not going to be tempted so Jesus don't say pray to God that you won't be tempted he said pray that you won't be led into temptation when he tells the disciples this when they're praying at Gethsemane he says he says literally he says this way he says so that you will not enter into temptation in other words he says Watch and Pray so that you will not fall into temptation watch and pray that you won't enter into temptation you see pray that you be not led into temptation see there's a difference between being tempted and entering into temptation I thought you know I thought about this how how that somebody come knock I remember a guy come to our house one time and and you know come knock on the door and he come up there talking and said you know you know I got something I want to I want to show you and he was a Salesman and of course me and Sarah sitting there and said you know I wanted to show us something notice what the salesman never says he never comes up there and says hey um you know what I I hope you got a big checkbook and you're ready to write a check it's going to cost a few thousand dollars but I got something I'm wanting to sell to you if you got a few extra thousand laying around he never says that but when he comes to the door and he knocks and he answer the door what he said was is that you know I got something I need to show you I thought well okay well it don't cost you nothing it ain't going to cost you a dime to look at it I just got something I want to show you you know what if I don't show people I don't beat my quota and then my boss going to be mad at me man they're not going to let me they're going to make fun of me around the office I'm gonna get tired and feathered I'm going have to around around I mean all this s story if I can just show you it won't cost you die won't take me just a minute but can I just show you but then notice what we did we opened the door and then the area entered in now we're in this inner sanctuary of the living room you know what he done he went around and he took this he started he started vacuuming up the car and then he started vacuuming the the the the the seats on the sofa and then he started vacuuming the pillars and then he said go get your pillar from your bedroom let me show you a little something got the pillar and he showed us how much how much uh dirty stuff was on our pillar with the vacuum cleaner needless to say by the time he was done we had a $1,400 vacuum cleaner it's still sitting in my shop you see there's a difference between being tempted and entering into temptation see to be tempted would be at the door saying I've got something I want to show you and you say but I don't want to see it well I got something let me just run this by you real quick I don't I'm I'm too busy but let me tell you what's going on in the church but I ain't got an ear for it let me tell you what what I saw this sister do down there the other day no I ain't got no time for it see there's a difference between being tempted won't you try this a little bit let me let me let me take you down this road won't you won't you won't you click on this website for just a minute there's a difference between being tempted and then entering into temptation see there's a place where you can stop there's a place that you can that you can walk away there's a place that that that that that it's easier to take a stand than entering into temptation so Jesus says pray to the father don't lead me into temptation so even when the tempter comes that he God he would stop it at the door God will never lead you into temptation he'll never lead you to to enter into this don't enter into temptation see the Bible even said this about Jesus our example he said he was tempted in every like manner of man that tells us that every man's going to be tempted he was tempted in every like manner every man is tempted but Jesus showed us how to keep from falling or entering into temptation notice when the Bible says I I know yall know this scripture but the Bible says whenever the devil came and he began to minister unto him he said the tempter came to him and he said if you be a Son of God command these tones to be made to bread Jesus answered him it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God it didn't matter what what the devil said Jesus's response was always the same he said but it is written why don't you why don't you why don't you step off this mountain because even the Bible said that you had charge over the angels and they had lift you up Jesus said but it is also written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God it didn't matter what the devil brought to him the answer is always the same but it is written he never attacked the word he never said that ain't true he never said I don't believe it that way but he retreated into the word of God and he said but it is also written any man that'll humble himself through the word of God will access the power of God it don't matter what Satan says the only way you'll ever overcome him is to retreat to the word of God the Bible says by the word of God was the world framed by the word of God is the world held together by the word of God it's only way you'll ever defeat the enemy is to retreat to the word of a living God you realize that's what happened when oh I feel like preaching that's what happened when David went out to fight Goliath that day and he heard the boastings of that great enemy over over the children of Israel and notice when David went into Saul's tent and Saul be to pile armor on him that he would be able to face his enemy but notice what David he said this armor it ain't doing me no good it ain't doing nothing but holding me back I can't move my arms in it I can't lift my hands in it I can't run like I used to I can't put this on but he went back and he relied on the testimonies of a living God when Satan would come and say put this armor on he relied on the testimonies of what God had already done and those testimonies of Victory as he begin to speak on to Saul you realize he said it was God that delivered me out of the mouth of a lion it was God that delivered me out of the out of the paws of a bear and how dare that uncircumcised Philistine stand against the army of a living God is't it something that he called him uncircumcised my makes I just want to preach he called him uncircumcised you realize what he was speaking of because David's circumcision was a sign of the Covenant that God had gave Israel so here when David would look at Goliath he'd say here's a man that stands outside the Covenant and he's talking to God's covenant people like he has power over them but there ain't a covenant on you the covenant's on me and that man David might have think about it he knew something that the world don't know a lot about he knew that there was nobody that was out from under that Covenant that had any power over anybody that was underneath that Covenant it didn't matter what they said it didn't matter where they tried to pull you to what trash they tried to drag you into they'll never Prevail over you because you're under the Covenant of the baptism of the Holy Ghost said see it's our covenant you know what David done he took his Covenant and he went down into the valley of elaw oh friend don't you realize he took the word that God had already spoke over him and he went down into the valley of elaw the very the very man that the prophet Samuel had anointed to be king over Israel he walked down with that anointing on his life under the Covenant of the almighty God and stood down there to face an enemy and guess what David was little isn't that the first thing the Goliath saw he said who would send this boy the Bible said he was offended that they would send a boy who would send a lad I I want your Warrior not the little one and he went to making fun of him but you realize that the word of God his Prophet had already been spoke over David's life and the giant as he scoffed and he made fun of him and he mocked him as a little boy I thought isn't it something that when David Goes to speaking that he don't talk like a little boy see the anointing on him he may he may have seemed like a a child he may have seemed a lesser he may have seemed a little boy but to the giant but whenever he began to speak notice what he speaks the Bible said and then David said to the Philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of is Israel whom thou Hast defied David said this battle ain't between me and you this battle's between you and my God this that battle ain't ain't your size and my size but it's your size and my God's size there's something about it he said you've defied the armies of the Living God and the god that you have defied so not by my own strength but by the strength of God not by my own power but by the power of God not by my own might but by the might of God I'll overcome you this day that little man man he said this day my watching prophesy glory to God that little man he said this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand I will Smite you I'll take your head from you I'll give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fouls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all of this assembly look he starts preaching to the Israelites he said all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with a sword not with a spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands and the Bible says and it came to pass oh I love it it came to pass that when the Philistine arose to come against David and he drew nigh to meet David the Bible says that David he hastened and ran toward the Army to beat the Philistine oh a little man had became big he wasn't afraid of him the Bible didn't say he second guessed himself he didn't run away but when that great giant stood up before him the Bible said he ran to meet his enemy I ain't going the other way but he went after his enemy let me tell you friend it don't matter how big the giant is it don't matter how big the tempter is but I think the army of the Living God the Sons and Daughters of God have a right to go face their enemy you take what God gave you the Covenant that you're living under and you going stand before your giant and slay him tonight he ran toward towards his enemy you take the fight to him oh my it does something to somebody you get old big bully keeps bullying everybody around you let some little guy stand up and hit him in the nose it changes the way he bullies everybody around you he took the fight to his enemy well I'm you know how they do goodness I went to school too I remember what it was like in school you get up there to somebody be mad at you one toy they they draw That Old Line in the Sand you cross that line I'm going to whoop you then they step across line you draw another one you cross that line and I'm going to whoop you Crossing well you cross that line I'm really going to whoop you the whole time backing enough David didn't draw no lines he went right to the enemy the Bible said he hastened and he ran and he said I don't have to draw a line you've already crossed the line when you defied the army of the Living God you uncircumcised Philistine and they took the fight to the enemy's Camp he took the word of the Lord butam say see you'll find people the way they do they'll say I got started but the devil made me go back he said no the devil don't do that you had to do that yourself he said everybody that comes to God has got to be tempted and tried but a real believer has heard the word of God and he's recognized it to be the word of God and he will act upon it David had a word and he acted on the word of God he took God's word over the devil's word isn't it something I I thought this is so I always think this is good in this story you realize that in the Bible many times you'll find that a sword is a type of the word how many knows that I thought isn't it something that the Bible says but David slew Goliath with his own sword he to or he took his head off with his own sword I thought isn't that something that Goliath the words that he said to David he said but you he said the fouls of the air are going to eat your blood they're going to eat your flesh and the Very words that he spoke is the very thing that happened to him I thought isn't it something he got his head taken off by his own sword that's what happens to the devil the very thing that he speaks against the children of God is the very thing that he's bringing upon himself he couldn't overcome David his own word became his faith and David overcame because he remained under the Covenant of God he stayed under the word he wouldn't accept anything that came outside of the word that's how I can stand here confident this morning or tonight and say this that we can overcome the devil somebody say Amen why because I'm not looking through the flesh I'm looking through the Covenant like David did even when we just deserve death but we have a covenant we deserve judgment brother Ben but we have a covenant here's what the Bible said this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my lws in their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more when we ought to fall and we ought to face judgment and we ought to face death but thank God there's a covenant to stand under tonight by their faith in the blood of Jesus Christ Paul said the church would have access to God boldness he said to approach the throne of almighty God isn't that that's the character of a perfect son or daughter of God is to be both humble and bold you've heard me say that before in other words they were humble they were humble in their Spirit but bold in their faith that's a perfect character humble in their Spirit but bold boldness Paul said to enter into the holiest how do we have that boldness he said by the blood of Jesus Christ by a New and Living Way he's consecrated us through the fa that is to say the flesh you say well what speak is he or what flesh is he speaking of the Flesh of the Son of God couldn't be my flesh My Flesh would fail couldn't be your flesh our flesh isn't worthy enough we couldn't enter we couldn't enter into the Throne of God based on our own flesh he said but by the Flesh of the Son of God we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all I'm about to close he said every priest standing daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices they'll never take away sins but this man after he offered one sacrifice for sins forever he sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting until en his enemies be made his foot stol isn't that something he was perfected Forever by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified now don't take that that sanctification is perfection because that ain't what he was teaching but you'll never be perfected without sanctification see he was perfected to see if the worshipper the Bible said when the worshipper once purged would have no more conscience of sin and he by his own sacrifice has perfected forever those that are Sanctified but man said perfected for how long isn't that good perfected for how long he said they're perfect forever then what is the Holy Ghost friend he said we've allowed too many things the Lutheran say well you join the Lutheran Church the just shall live by faith we must got it he said but they found out they didn't the me says well when you're Sanctified you sh and clapped your hands you run up and down the aisle you had it but they found out they didn't the Pentecostal said you could speak in tongues and dance in the spirit they thought they had it but they found out they didn't all those things are all right but it is not Perfection it ain't it it ain't Perfection but he said but it's the person the Holy Spirit himself the resurrected Jesus Christ when you can lay your hands glory to God by faith upon God's accepted and provided sacrifice which was absolutely perfect there's the body of Christ that lay there before you out of Adam's side came a rib that made his bride he said but out of Christ's side came the spirit for his bride so how do we get into the body by one Spirit the B Bible said we're baptized into one body Paul said now there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit perfected forever as the music player come think about it the perfected forever Paul said said for the law if you want to stand to your feet he said for the law of the spirit of Life In Christ hath made me free from the law of sin and death it was a pardon of God a demand a call of God to be made perfect and then God would Supply away or provide way that Perfection would come my isn't it wonderful A Perfect Bride a sinless bride I ain't got time to read all of it a virtuous bride the very very image of almighty God perfect in the sight of God I know we look at one another you may not see that Perfection but when God looks at you that's what he sees I can tell you that you we get so guilty about all the the things we do you can't even look at yourself in the mirror feel perfect we're so guilty said but what's what this pardon from God does can I read this he said that pardon from God it'll release you from your guilt see that's what I wish to place on this a pardon from God is a release from guilt the very thing that Satan would use to hold you the very thing that that he would use to you're little you're a little Christian why you you can't even get past past the first day you're you're just a little Christian you always fall you ain't you ain't never going to be a big Christian you're you're a nobody Christian why they don't ever even use you at church they they never they never want to hear you sing they never want to hear you preach why because you're too little guilt and guilt said but no listen to all that a pardon from God is release from you not the Turning Away of some psychological doctr of some sort they give you a little feeling that you've done what's right by joining Church taking up some Creed but a pardon from God is a release from your guilt by the power of Calvary a perfect sacrifice might it something and the Bible says now we for if the worshipper once purged would have no more conscience of sin but he by his own sacrifice has perfected forever those that are Sanctified I wonder how many worshippers are here tonight they say brother mad I want to put my hand on the sacrifice I ain't going by my own life I wonder if there's some worshippers that can rise up tonight say not by my own marit not by my own feelings or my own my own uh things but by the blood of Jesus Christ I Rise to what God has made me I say let us rise tonight the worshippers of almighty God that's been perfected in his sight ain't no sense in being down Church you may as well rise you ain't little you're big Christians you're growing in the word of God how means how many further along than you were yesterday how many further along than you were when you're started you ain't a little Christian you're big Christians you're big Sons and Daughters of God with the life of Jesus Christ growing inside of you you ain't what you were when you came here you may have seen little you may have felt little but you're a big
