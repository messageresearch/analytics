Praise the Lord. Appreciate our musicians. Amen. Certainly have a wonderful atmosphere here today. Amen. Very good worship. Amen. Everybody seems to be in tune. Amen. Amen. So, it's just good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. I feel like I woke up this morning and went outside and back by the back patio and just felt the big old breeze coming up out of that bluff and leaves blowing everywhere and the cold wind. And I says, "Well, f fall finally got here. It's about time. Where you been?" I feel like we're just really been introduced to fall this morning. So, praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Usually, I'm in the woods by this time of the year quite a bit, but I haven't even gone out there yet, hardly at all. But maybe in the next week or two, I'm going to try to find time to go out there. Amen. Amen. I really need to climb a tree. I I feel the need to. Amen. Amen. And just watch those animals and watch the beautiful creation of God. Enjoy God's creation. Amen. God bless everybody this morning. Good to see everybody here this morning. Amen. We want to remember. Amen. Continue to remember. We're very thankful that some of us are feeling better. Amen. But Serenity and Haven and SA and Brother Joe and Sister Hannah, I guess they've really had a bad go around of it. Amen. And so whatever it is, it's causing a cough and it's certainly hanging on. Amen. Hangs on pretty long. So we just pray that the Lord will deliver. Amen. Especially Brother Joe and Sister Hannah. Amen. That he'll just live lift them up out of that. Amen. Amen. And so I hope everybody else feeling good. Amen. You're in church this morning, so I trust that. Amen. Amen. Everybody's feeling good. Good to see you. Good. Good to see you, brother Eduardo. And good to see you all this morning. Amen. So, praise the Lord. Just trying to get the feel of it. Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads, Lord Jesus, as we come before you, bowing, Lord, to the dust from where we was made, Lord. And father and also we look up in our spiritual eyesight to you Lord Jesus who has created us created the inner man the spiritual man our soul father and this morning Lord we want to feed that man Lord Jesus we're not so concerned about the natural man as we are about the spiritual man father so we ask God that you would just come in a special way Lord and Father you said somewhere in your word I believe it it's you said you'd make your ministers a flame of fire Lord and we certainly can't preach reach without your fire, Lord. So we ask, God, that the great Holy Spirit would just come, Lord, this morning and speak to our hearts, speak to our lives this morning, Lord Jesus, and and give us a timely message, Father. For we know that we're living in a late hour, Father, and and as your prophet, as we listen to a prophet, how that we can remember. How much had he said that it's later than you think? We're at the end time. It's the end. And how much he said that, Father? How much more is that does that apply to this morning Lord and where we are. So we ask God that is Father I feel you've laid a message on my heart to bring to the church. We ask God that you would help me Lord Jesus to get out of the way and that you might deliver what you have to say to the people Lord Jesus and that we would go from here a better Christian that we did when we came through those double doors. Father we believe that's possible God Lord Jesus and we didn't come here to stay neutral. We didn't come here to stay on the same place. But Lord, even as your prophet has taught us, we either leave better or we leave worse. Amen. So we ask God that we would all leave better. Lord, bless the meditation of our heart. Bless your word now as we're about to open your book. We know that it takes you to give us the true inspiration from it. For we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. Amen. So my inspiration, this is going to be kind of different, but my inspiration Amen. this morning came from. Amen. Our fall theme. Our fall theme. Amen. And if you will put the title up. I titled this. Amen. Rapture ready checklist. Amen. But in reality, I kind of wanted to put up put up there rapture ready rodeo checklist. And I thought, wow, that that's different. Are you sure you want to do that? And I'm like, well, and I I kind of got away from it. And I said, "Well, Lord, if that's what you want, that's what we'll speak on." Amen. So, that's what I feel like we need to speak on. Amen. And we might mention rodeo a little bit. Amen. Because it's certainly a a spiritual application because Amen. We know that in a rodeo that there's all kinds of races. Ain't that right? Barrel races and bull fighting and all whatnot or bull riding. Some of in some cases maybe somebody get up there and get out there and try to stand in front of a bull or whatever. and and because of his because of his wits and so forth to have a charging bull come right at you with great big horns and to be able to leap up over top of him, you know, and he misses you or you know how they do. You just a little bit of a sweep and the bull runs right by and his horns just grazes him a little bit, you know, and I thought, you know, that's the way it is. And it's a competition for for who's the best or who can take down a calf the quickest. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. And I thought that's about the way it ought to be in the house of God. You know, it's wonderful when the devil comes by and he tries to gore you, you know, and puts thoughts in there and I mean, we're not the champion isn't the one that lets it go in his head and fights with it for two weeks. He's not the champion. But if this morning you can say just get on and buy me bird, let me take this shotgun, blow it out of the air. He's the winner. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So that's right. We can we can have winners. And Paul said, you know, we all run in this race. We're all in a race. Amen. And run in a race and so forth. But anyway, so [sighs] amen. The scripture we want to go to this morning. We want to read about two or three of them to start with. Amen. Because I have several and if I don't read them, I probably won't get to them. So, let's go first of all to Luke. No, let's go to Matthew first and then Luke. Matthew. Amen. And now, if you'll notice here, this these these words, Amen. that we want to speak on for a while. And and I honestly don't think that I'll get through by any means because we do want to have communion this morning. Amen. And there has been times when I would just quit studying because I knew if I would study more, we're just going to go long. Amen. And so we've got enough to last us a while. Amen. And it's cold outside, it's warm inside. You got nice padded pews. It's very comfortable. Right. And everybody's got your bacon and egg sandwich this morning. So you're good, right? Amen. It'd be a while before you get hungry and we only have one service today. So, we got to get crammed two in one. So, you know, we have every reason to not get in a hurry. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's not get in a hurry and just see what the Holy Spirit would have for us this morning. Amen. Amen. Amen. I'll tell you this right now. Amen. I believe we have more to preach about than we've ever had. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have we've got more material. We've got more uh things that we can just keep going and keep going and keep going with. Amen. And just really really have be able at the end of the service to be able to push back from the table and say, "Man, I just ate myself till I'm bloated and feel like a tick." So, let's let's hope that we are get real good and full this morning. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Let your soul delight itself in fatness, the Bible says. Amen. All right. Matthew 24. Matthew 24. A very familiar scripture. And we want to start with rapture. Amen. Then the next thought's going to be ready. Amen. And also we'll combine into that checklist. Amen. A checklist. Amen. Matthew 24 and we'll begin with verse 32. Now learn the parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth his leaves. Ye know that summer is nigh. So likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors. Amen. Verily, verily, verily, I say unto you, this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled. Amen. How many knows the correct interpretation of that? The brother Ben Brandham talked about that that fig tree was Israel and he said that generation that sees, amen, the coming together of Israel, that generation would not die off until all these things will be fulfilled. So that is very very relevant to you and I isn't that right? Because we know that you know those who even those who were born let's say in in 1950 um they're they're going to be like 50 75 years old already. &gt;&gt; That was maybe a a year or two after the birth. That's as a baby. &gt;&gt; Amen. So how many knows it's getting close? How many believes the hour is late? &gt;&gt; How many believes heaven and earth will pass away, but his word won't pass away? &gt;&gt; It's not going to fail. &gt;&gt; So you and I can count on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But of the day and the hour knoweth no man, not the angels of heaven, but my father only. And but as the days of the Noah were, so also is the coming of the coming of the son of man be. Amen. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all away, so shall also the coming of the son of man be. Two shall be in the field, the one shall be taken, the other one left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill, one shall be taken, and the other one left. Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour the Lord doth come. Amen. Amen. Brother Bram I in this uh second coming of the Lord 19570417 preached on the second coming of the Lord he says you know in that book he says that in the last days of Jesus which was right here towards the end of Matthew you know even though he was going to go to Calvary and he was going to rise again but Ram said he talked more about his second coming than he did about his resurrection and going away. Amen. And so here's part of that. Amen. Two women shall be grinding at the mill. The one shall be taken and the other one left. Watch therefore, for you know not what hour the Lord doth come. But know this that if the goodman of the house would have known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Be therefore be ye also ready. There's our other word in our Amen. uh title this morning. Ready. I like that. Amen. Rapture ready. Amen. For in such an hour as you think not, the son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise? Amen. How many's interested in being a little bit smart? &gt;&gt; Wise. We call it smarts. You know, let's be wise, &gt;&gt; not unwise. Ain't that right? There's two categories of people here in the rapture. Amen. Those that are wise and the unwise. Amen. wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give unto them meat in due season. Blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, my lord delayeth his coming, he shall be and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and eat and drink with the drunken. The Lord of thou s servant shall come in a day when he lookth not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him aunderder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites that shall be weeping and nashing of teeth. I'm going to let you be seated. Amen. At this time, Amen. Amen. Amen. First of all, first thing I want to say is that not very many people care. The world doesn't really care about whether they're ready to for his coming or not. Amen. Now, how many believes the rapture is an appointment? &gt;&gt; It's something that's going to happen in the future and it's something that we're either going to be ready for or we're not going to be ready for it. Amen. And I believe the people that are going to be ready for it, there's going to be something on the inside of them that really really cares. &gt;&gt; Cuz to not care is an insane statement. &gt;&gt; People just don't really care and THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE MOST VALUABLE thing that they have. They place values on the wrong thing. What's the most valuable thing that you have? That's your soul. Amen. That's your soul. I just thought about this. I thought, you know, I'm so thankful that God gives us a care. &gt;&gt; Amen. about this rapture. Amen. Talking about the rapture, I want to read it. It says, "I would have not you." And you know, it's something about how that we use this so many times to try to bring comfort at a funeral, but amen. But I don't know Paul used this for a funeral text. He did talk about those that sleep, that we sorrow not as those who uh don't have any hope. But I believe this is is can apply to us. Amen. Outside of a funeral setting. Amen. [snorts] I would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope. But if for if we believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Now, if you've been in the message very long, you know, you can go into uh the coming of the Lord, the second coming of the Lord, and so forth. And brother Brandham going through the rapture. I believe it was uh the rapture that he preached this on. I won't go through it this morning, but [snorts] he talks about uh describes that this message. Amen. First, there's a message that goes forth. Amen. Amen. And he certainly makes it sound like the message that you and I are in. Amen. A message goes forth. Amen. A trumpet sounds. Amen. A message goes forth. and just how all that is. And if you ask five different preachers for different interpretations, you might get a little bit different. Amen. But this is what I'm waiting for. I'm looking for the time. Amen. If truly I, you know, I wouldn't doubt it that it's the message and the trumpet, but there has to be a time when speak Jesus speaks. When a trumpet blows and Jesus speaks AND HE CALLS ALL THOSE THAT ARE DEAD OUT OF THE GRAVE. How many believes when the role is called up yonder, I'LL BE THERE. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS TO MAKE THAT CALL. But Abraham said, if Jesus when at Jesus at Lazarus grave, if he wouldn't have said Lazarus and he'd have just said come forth, didn't brother Bam SAY THEY ALL COME FORTH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. WHY? SO WHEN JESUS SAYS THAT, AMEN. WHEN HE SAID WHEN HE CALLS THEM ALL [screaming] OUT, AMEN. WE'RE GOING TO COME FORTH. AMEN. I don't know how he'll do it. I don't know that any man will know how he do it, BUT HOW MANY KNOWS THAT WHEN HE SAYS, "COME HOME MY CHILD." MAYBE HE'LL SAY, "MY CHILDREN." CUZ WHEN HE CALLS, then how many knows? Not everybody's coming up out of the grave. Not everybody. Only his elect will come up out of the grave. That's why I say I don't know just what the words that he'll say or what he'll say. But we do know that not all of them come at that time. Not until after the thousand years. And it says then he calls everybody up. Everybody see gave up the debt therein and everything everywhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And it goes a little bit into accountability. Talking about accountability and Amen. And a checklist. And Amen. We want to talk about that checklist of the rapture of of whether we're ready or not. How many believes we need to if you're going to if YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT, YOU BETTER BE READY FOR that appointment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I want that's Amen. But let's talk about this here. How many believes there's going to be a rapture? &gt;&gt; Amen. I've been in the message for quite some time and I do know that those who were into the uh [snorts] doctrine of Peruia. Amen. And Amen. that they uh made some strong statements and you know that the Lord has come already. So why are you looking for him? Amen. And things like that. Why are you looking for him? Amen. And and so you know it was kind of Sure. And I can show you, brother Bam said that Jesus has come into fullness in his church, in his spirit, in his people. He's come in his fullness. &gt;&gt; He has. But even way back in invisible union of the bride. Amen. Towards the end. Amen. Uh he said it this way. And we are enthused about it. And we know that history is closing out. The world's history will soon be over. Then we're going to step over into a new day to the great millennium. Amen. Amen. So, uh, that as one believer, I believe in a millennium, a millennial reign with Christ A THOUSAND YEARS UPON the earth, the physical return of the Lord Jesus Christ to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood. So you see, no matter how much DO WE SHOULD KNOW AND BELIEVE THAT HE'S COME SPIRITUALLY, we believe that he's here. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENCE OF GOD. PERUIAN MEANS THE PRESENCE OF GOD. HOW MANY believe we sensed it right right off of right off the go get in our service. Amen. Our song service, we sense the presence of God. HOW MANY BELIEVES THE PRESENCE OF GOD is here. The perusia of God is here. &gt;&gt; But there will be A PHYSICAL COMING of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. to receive a physical people and to change us in the moment IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AT THE LAST TRUMP. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT IS OUR GOAL? THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. THAT'S our objective. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. And therefore, Amen. Even as anyone WHO HAS GOT THAT GOAL, HAS GOT THAT AMBITION. AMEN. Gets ready. You have to get ready because I believe it was even Jesus said, "Therefore, be ready for you know not the day or the hour." &gt;&gt; Rapture ready. Get ready because you don't know just when that'll be. We know that the nations are shaking. Uh Russia, America, Trump and all of them is always they're threatening nuking nuking each other. the threat. How somebody knows the threat level, the the verbal threats with the mouth have really come up. Amen. And this thing with the Ukraine and the war that's going on and how that Putin has warned and warned that if you supply them, then you're involved. Then you're part of it. Ain't that right? As far as I'm concerned, we're at war with you, so to speak. Amen. We'll do this and we'll do that. And they all kinds of threats, you know, and I mean, right there at the verge. And brother Benham, look what he said after the woman and so forth. The next thing he saw was nothing but a burnt over America. &gt;&gt; Amen. But so I believe, how many believes it's about time to get out of here? It's about time to leave. And this morning, what we come to church for, &gt;&gt; Amen. is to check up. &gt;&gt; Amen. the second coming of the Lord. He says it this way. It's later than we think. Paragraph 5, paragraph 54, he says, "We don't just come to church to occupy a pew. &gt;&gt; We do NOT COME TO CHURCH JUST TO HEAR A GOOD SERMON." WE COME to church or come to church just to hear good music. &gt;&gt; THEY ALL GOT THEIR PLACE. BUT WHAT WE BETTER COME TO CHURCH for is to check up with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe other places he says? You know, we better BE CHECKING UP EVERY MONTH. We better check up every week. We better check up every day. WE BETTER CHECK UP EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS MORNING. WE WANT TO NOT JUST A CHECK CHECK UP FROM THE NECK UP as brother Ernie Velinova used to say it. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT A CHECKUP FROM THE NECK DOWN. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT WHAT'S UP HERE, BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S IN HERE &gt;&gt; IN the heart. And in order for you to really have that light to shine down in your heart, it takes the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to do it. &gt;&gt; Thank God for people that care about their welfare and where they are with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought that was good. This was just him kind of beginning to speak. Now, let me uh go back and read another scripture in Luke that I wanted to go to. In Luke 15 and8 he says and I want to kind of go into the area of checking up now. Amen. checking up. Either what woman having 10 pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a candle and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it. &gt;&gt; And when she has found it, she callth her friends and her neighbors rather, saying, "Rejoice with me, FOR I HAVE FOUND THE PEACE WHICH I HAVE [screaming] LOST." AMEN. How many knows THE CHURCH LOST A LOT ALL DOWN THROUGH THE AGES? They lost their first love. THEY GOT BITTERNESS IN THEIR HEART. THEY GOT ALMIGHTY. THEY LOST THEIR FAITH. THEY LOST THEIR ADHERENCE TO THE WORD. THEY LOST ALL KINDS OF THINGS. &gt;&gt; But we know THAT WE WERE RESTORED IN OUR GENERATION. And we're supposed to be have been restored back. Amen. But this woman, I mean, this is the scripture that he reads when he speaks on the second coming of Christ in 57. Now, this may SEEM LIKE A ODD SCRIPTURE for the second coming of Christ, but it's speaking of the second coming. And this great SUBJECT THAT WE HAVE HERE NOW BEFORE US IS THE MOST VITAL SUBJECT OF THE ENTIRE RED. HE SAYS, "THERE'S NOTHING AS SO IMPORTANT AS THE COMING OF THE LORD JESUS." &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'd like for us all to repeat that. There's nothing so important as the coming of the Lord Jesus. There's nothing in your life, nothing in your life so important as the coming of the Lord Jesus. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; I certainly do. Amen. Brother Brandham says it this way. Heal the sick and the afflicted. We pray that. We pray that tonight. his in his prayer that you'll give us such a great service. May there not be a fe feeble person in our midst because of your presence. Lord, may our hearts continually be set on thee. And we know, Lord, that money, property, things of the world have no meanings. They're just temporal. All of them must go. Our jobs, our places, our friends, everything must go. No matter how rich or how poor or how popular or unpopular that we are, it all must go. There's only one thing that our being here is centered around. I hope I'm speaking to your souls this morning. And that's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Centered around. And that's Jesus Christ. So God, let us lay aside everything that's secondary and hold on to him. And he is the word, the vindicated word of the hour. &gt;&gt; How many believes everything in this world is secondary? &gt;&gt; Amen. This right here is what we're doing is first in your life. First in my life. &gt;&gt; It's first, not second, not third. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we allow it. Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't want it. God don't want him to be sec. He don't want to be second in your life. No. Anything you put before God is an idol. Amen. An idol. Amen. Let's look for a minute before we get into this. Let's look at those who are not ready. those who don't check up, those who are not going, not going to make it. Would that be all right? In order to do so, the first one of course is the one that we just read about in Matthew. And that is if the servant listen. But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, "The Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to smite his fellow serpent servants and to eat and to drink with the drunken and so forth." In other words, he gets lukewarm, backslid. Think that God, well, you know, I've heard that before, brother Ber. I've heard so much about the coming of the Lord, the coming of the Lord, the rapture taking place until you hear so much until you just become slack and it doesn't really mean that much to you anymore. You are a prime suspect &gt;&gt; for being left behind, &gt;&gt; for being left out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You get slack, you drink, you do things you ought to do, live wrong. Ain't that right? And then in Romans, let's look at this category of people here. Romans 1 and these people who professed themselves to be wise, became fools, and so forth. Way down in verse 29 of Romans, he says, "Being filled with unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventive, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents." Amen. without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implicable, unmerciful, who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death. Over in Revelations 21 and verse 8, it says, "But the fearful, the unbelieving." Huh? You know how terrible a thing it is to be fearful and unbelieving? [clears throat] How many believes that? Let me just I'm going to take my time. How many believes that God comes to take that fear out of our lives? &gt;&gt; Sin brings condemnation. Condemnation brings fear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sin, condemnation, fear. How many times he say, "Fear not. Fear not. Fear not." Nothing to be fearful. It's because they're unbelieving. the abominable, the murderers, whoreongers, sorcerers, idoltors. Remember, idolatry is to put something else before God first. &gt;&gt; Whatever you put before God is idolatry. Amen. And all liars shall have their part in the lake which burnth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. So we see those who are not prepared. How many know we could go into Revelation 3. Amen. Thou sayest thou art rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are miserable, wretched, poor, blind, and naked. What did God do with them? Spew them out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; How many believe there's many people that seem to be very spiritual? VERY SPIRITUAL. They can uh heal the sick. THEY CAN CAST OUT DEVILS. THEY CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS. BUT WHEN THAT DAY COMES, WHAT will he SAY? HE'LL SAY, "DEPART FROM ME, YOU WORKERS OF INIQUITY. I NEVER KNEW YOU." WHY? BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAD A deep relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Brandham, I believe, defined that that that I never knew you. Amen. Talking about a deep personal relationship. Amen. They had a relationship ON THE FLESH. HALLELUJAH. BOY, that feels good. Amen. Or in the spirit realm, BUT THEY NEVER GOT it in the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. The rain falls on the just on the unjust, but it didn't go all the way to their soul. So, we see that group of people, they're not ready. THEY HAVEN'T CHECKED UP. THEY DIDN'T CARE. How many believes we need to care about our soul? We need to care about where you at with God. &gt;&gt; It's checking up time. It's always checking up time. Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. So again he says when he says it's the this great subject that here before us is the most vital subjects of the entire holy rit. There's nothing so important as the coming of the Lord Jesus. I stopped there and I thought look at that nothing as important. Why? Now, his first COMING WAS IMPORTANT. WHAT HE DID ON CALVARY WAS IMPORTANT. BUT LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU BUY SOMETHING AT A STORE and you pay for it, Amen. And then you HAVE TO GO TO THAT STORE PERHAPS TO PICK IT UP. WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR MOST JOYOUS MOMENT WHEN YOU PAID FOR IT? NO. THE MOST JOYOUS TIME IS WHEN YOU GET A HOLD OF IT. SAY, "HEY, here it is. THIS IS WHAT I BOUGHT." &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE SECOND COMING OF THE LORD IS. &gt;&gt; All the way. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT THAT BACK BEFORE GOD WAS GONE WHEN HE WAS ALL BY HIMSELF, all alone. Didn't even have any angels yet to worship him. And he takes he HAS AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP means God. God had you have to have a uh somebody worshiping you in order to be a God. So way before then there he was and he had a DESIRE IN HIS HEART. How many believe GOD HAD A DESIRE in his heart? HE HAD SOME SUBSTANCE, something on the inside OF HIM THAT HE WANTED to manifest, THAT HE WANTED TO GRAB A HOLD OF, that he wanted to be tangible. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING THAT HE'S STILL NOT THERE YET. &gt;&gt; GOD IS STILL NOT THERE YET. HE'S WORKING ON GETTING THERE. [laughter] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. BECAUSE ALL THOSE SOULS, PAUL'S GROUP, IRENEIUS'S GROUP, OUR GROUP, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S GROUP, WHERE ARE THEY? THEY'RE NOT there in WITH HIM. THEY'RE NOT WITH JESUS. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE A STEP BELOW HIM. &gt;&gt; How many knows that even brother Brandham wanted to see him and the angel says, "No, no, no, no, no. Not time yet. HE'S UP HIGHER YET. YOU'RE RIGHT UNDER THE ALTAR. YOU'RE RIGHT IN HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; You're in THE PRESENCE OF GOD, BUT YOU'RE JUST A STEP BELOW. OH, he's in another dimension, even higher. &gt;&gt; And he's WAITING FOR THAT LAST ONE TO COME IN. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT LAST ONE COMES IN, RAPTURE TIME, REMEMBER WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, MAN, I'M TELLING YOU, PAUL'S GROUP, Ireneius's group. &gt;&gt; Amen. H should I say it or shouldn't I? There was this relative of mine. I'll just say that way. Amen. That well I can't say it without you know who I'm talking about. My brother Mooney. I'm going to talk about my brother Mooney. He was kind of you know he went through a real rough time. Mervous breakdown and everything and he's had it real hard but he kind of got away from uh the message kind of and so forth. And I said what do you believe? do you believe brother Brandham was a prophet yet and so forth and yeah I believe you know and he says well he was just kind of and says and I says IF NOT IF YOU'RE NOT A CONVERT of brother Brandham then what group are you going to come up with &gt;&gt; where ARE YOU GOING TO COME UP at &gt;&gt; Cuz how many know BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THEY'RE YOUR CONVERTS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M not ashamed to say I'm a CONVERT TO BROTHER BRANDON NOT ONE [screaming] BIT &gt;&gt; WHY BECAUSE HE WAS A SEVENTH ANGEL HE WAS ONE OF THOSE ANGELS THAT HAVE THEIR GROUP. &gt;&gt; How many BELIEVES WE'RE PART OF THAT GROUP? [screaming] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SAY IT, BUT THEY'LL COME. THAT GROUP OF YOU ALL COME AND I DON'T KNOW. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT BECAUSE THE WAY THAT BROTHER BRANDON PREACHED IT, he says, "Man, it's going to be like a parade." &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY'LL COME FORTH AND THEY'LL COME FORTH AND GUESS WHAT? WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET TO CROWN HIM KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. EITHER ALL OF US DO OR NONE OF US DO. Thank you, Jesus. [applause] THAT'S RIGHT. NOBODY GETS TO SEE HIM UNTIL ALL OF US GET TO SEE HIM. OH, I WANT TO see him. LOOK UPON HIS FACE THERE TO SING FOREVER OF HIS SAVING GRACE ON THE STREETS OF GLORY. LET US LIFT OUR VOICE. CARES OUR PAST HOME AT LAST. EVER TO REJOICE. HOW MANY LOOKING FOR THAT DAY? COME ON, PEOPLE. BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IT IN YOUR HEART. LET GOD COME DOWN THIS MORNING AND PENETRATE YOUR HEART. GET RID OF the worldly things. IT'S TIME TO PUT THE PEANUTS down [applause] and BEGIN TO EMBRACE THE PRESENCE OF GOD. AMEN. WE'RE GOING TO BE WELCOMING HIM. WHAT SCOTT GOT TO DO? SHUT THIS CHURCH DOWN. WHAT'S HE GOT TO DO? BRING A PERSECUTION UNTIL WE'LL BEGIN TO CRY FOR HIM AND SAY, "LORD, EVEN SO, GOD, COME LORD. [screaming] WE'RE READY FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. DON'T HAVE TO PERSECUTE ME. YOU AIN'T GOT TO PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD. AMEN. NO, I'M GOING TO WORSHIP AND SAY, "GOD, WE'RE WAITING FOR YOUR COMING. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT OF ALL TIME, [screaming] ALL ETERNITY." IT'S WHAT HE HAD IN HIS MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. [screaming] THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; That's why it's such a great event. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; There's nothing so important as the coming of the Lord. [sighs and gasps] FOR IF HE DOES NOT COME, I'm going to SAY BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT, YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING. THEN BROTHER BAM SAYS, MAN, YOU CAN'T MISS IT. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T MISS THAT TIME. YOU GO AHEAD AND YOU LET THE HOLY SPIRIT COME DOWN AND CHECK YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; DO A CHECKUP. MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY TO GO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what we come to the house of God for. Not to worm up you. Not just to hear another sermon by your pastor or brother Brad. No, WE COME HERE TO CHECK UP. SAY, "LORD, HERE I AM. HERE, TAKE MY HAND, LORD JESUS. I LIFT IT UP. SAY, "LOOK, IF THERE'S ANY EVIL WAY IN ME, LORD, IF THERE'S ANYTHING I'M DOING, IF I'M MADE SOMETHING ELSE AN IDOL, [screaming] GOD, TAKE IT AWAY. IF I'VE BECOME LUKEWARM, GOD, TAKE IT AWAY. IT'S A CHECKLIST. ARE YOU LUKEWARM THIS MORNING? GOD, TAKE THAT AWAY." IF YOU ARE, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FIRST [screaming] LOVE FOR GOD? AMEN. DO YOU NOT CARED ABOUT PRAYING ANYMORE? IS IT HARD FOR YOU TO PRAY? IT SHOULD be easy for you to pray. AMEN. YOU COULDN'T STAND TO GO OUT AND WORK. YOU CAN'T GO AFTER [screaming] BREAKFAST WITHOUT HAVING A PRAYER. GET ON YOUR KNEES AND SAY, "GOD, I CAN'T WALK WITHOUT YOU HOLDING MY HAND. I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS DAY WITHOUT YOU LEADING ME AND GUIDING ME." THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. WE NEED PEOPLE THAT HAVE GOT THE LOVE OF GOD IN THEIR HEART. IF YOU AIN'T GOT THAT LOVE IN YOUR HEART, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE. BUT B SAID, "WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU LAY [screaming] ASIDE EVERYTHING UNTIL YOU GOT THAT PERFECT LOVE. IT'S TIME TO CHECK. SEE IF YOU HAVE THAT LOVE. [applause] THANK YOU, JESUS. THAT'S RIGHT. GOD, GIVE US THAT LOVE. WE LOVE CHURCH. WE GOD [screaming] LOVE PEOPLE OF GOD. WE LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE MORE THAN HUNTING OR FISHING OR ANY KIND OF PLEASURE THAT IT MIGHT BE OUT THERE. [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; AMEN. These days of mediocracy is over. [panting] Time to be on fire. &gt;&gt; Time to let it burn. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; CUZ WHEN THE ROLL IS CALLED UP YONDER, CHECKING UP IS KIND OF LIKE A ROLL CALL IN THE ARMY. HEY, ARE YOU THERE, BROTHER JOHN? ARE YOU THERE? BROTHER TRUMP, HERE. AMEN. BROTHER JOSHUA, ARE YOU HERE PRESENT? WE OUGHT TO HAVE A ROLL CALL on Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THEN READ OFF THE ONES THAT'S MISSING. &gt;&gt; READ off the ones that are not feeling well. Why is this no one not here? WHY IS THAT ONE NOT HERE? WHY ARE YOU NOT HERE THIS MORNING? ASK YOURSELF THAT QUESTION. CHECK YOUR OWN HEART. SEE WHAT KEPT YOU OUT OF CHURCH. &gt;&gt; That wasn't on the script, but it was on his script, so that's good enough for me. IS THAT THE TRUTH THOUGH? &gt;&gt; LORD HELP US. &gt;&gt; That's right. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT YOU BETTER HAVE THE WEDDING GARMENT? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE WAS A WEDDING MADE AND AND EVERYBODY WAS INVITED and he invited the guests AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS MADE EXCUSE AND THEY DIDN'T COME. HE SAID GO INTO THE HIGHWAYS AND HEDGES AND BID EVERYBODY TO COME. AMEN. AND HIS GUEST AND THEN AND THEN WHEN HE DID FINALLY COME, I WON'T READ THE SCRIPTURES. HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, HE COME IN there and one of them didn't HAVE THE WEDDING GARMENT ON. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE ROBE ON. HE SAYS, "WHAT ARE YOU doing in HERE WITHOUT A ROBE?" AND THE MAN WAS SPEECHLESS. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU GET OVER YONDER, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU BETTER BE DRESSED IN THE ROBE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE DRESSED UP. BROTHER MAN SAID, "WHEN I COME DOWN TO THE RIVER, AMEN. I WANT TO WRAP MYSELF IN THE ROBE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND GO INTO HIS ARMS. NOT ON [screaming] MY RIGHTEOUSNESS, ON HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS." YOU BETTER HAVE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE HOLY BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IN YOUR LIFE. [applause] AMEN. Praise be to God. Listen, many of you, Brother Ram says, this is supposed to be my last one, but I'm going to read it. Many of you have professed Christianity for a long time and know that you have FAILED TO TOTAL ALIGN WITH GOD. KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING THINGS RIGHT NOW THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO DO AND YOU'RE GOING ON [screaming] UNCONFESSING OF THEM. HOW MANY believe we NEED THE HOLY SPIRIT, AMEN, TO CONVICT US? &gt;&gt; Whether we're DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD OR WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE DOING, GOD BRING THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO CONVICT US WHERE WE'RE WRONG. All right. Amen. Praise the Lord. Unconfessing, just loosely floating along with the tide. How many for a real believer floating along with the tide's just not going to cut it? Brother Daniel Cl just going along with the flow is not gonna do it. I forgot my prayer life this morning. I didn't read my Bible. I don't really have a relationship with God. That's just not going to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. GETTING SO BUSY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME FOR GOD IS JUST NOT GOING TO WORK. &gt;&gt; WHY? CUZ IT'S ABOUT TIME TO ROW AGAINST THE STREAM. IT'S TIME TO DO A LITTLE [screaming] PADDLING CUZ IT'S FLOWING THAT WAY. BUT I REFUSE TO KEEP I'M GOING TO GET CLOSER TO GOD THAN I WAS YESTERDAY. COME ON. LET'S DO [screaming] A LITTLE PADDLING. LET'S NOT FLOW WITH THE TIDE. LET'S GO UPSTREAM CUZ THERE'S A FALL DOWN THERE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF THE FALL. HOW MANY GLAD FOR THAT? [applause] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; God is very good. Amen. I like it. God is good. Today, if a woman is married, she should wear a wedding ring as a sign that she's married. That's to keep other men from having anything to do with her. They look and they see she's a married woman. In those days, they didn't have wedding rings. They had a tablet. I don't know if I ever read that. I think I might have. Remember in Luke, did I read that? I think I did. Thank you. But this is him explaining it. Amen. It says, "And that tablet was on their head. It had 10 coins and it went around their head and it was a sign they were married woman. No man was to fool with them. No boys was to flirt with them. They were married." Each one of those can t coins had a different meaning. Let me bring that down. Different meaning. Amen. So, I'll I'll pass on that. But listen, he says, if you want to look it up, Galatians 5, you'll find that that the woman represented the church, and the church IS A SPOUSE WIFE to Christ. The tablet AND THE CHURCH IS SUPPOSED TO wear that the church is supposed to wear is found in Galatians five, which is love and joy and peace and longsuffering and goodness and meekness and gentleness and patience. THAT IS THE TABLET THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WORN BY THE CHURCH. BROTHERLY KINDNESS, FELLOWSHIP, AND so forth. AND IF THERE EVER WAS A TIME THE CHURCH OUGHT TO TAKE INVENTORY TO FIND OUT IF IT'S GOT ALL THE COINS, IT SHOULD be [clears throat] in 2025. I'm willing to say, how many believes that this morning? IF THERE EVER WAS [screaming] A TIME THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INVENTORY &gt;&gt; to see whether we Well, let me put it just THE WAY THAT IT COMES TO see whether this HAS JUMPED OFF OF HERE [screaming] AND LODGED IN HERE. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO HAVE? WE CAN'T HAVE IT ON TAPES ANYMORE. NOT JUST ON BOOKS ANYMORE, BUT IT'S GOT TO COME FROM HERE TO HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming] AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT GOD IS WORKING ON US? WHETHER YOU DON'T IF YOU AIN'T GOT PERFECT LOVE, GOD WILL SHOW YOU. HE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY CROSS YOU UP. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. CUZ THEN YOU THAT'S HOW YOU'LL KNOW WHETHER you can love your enemies. BUT BAM SAYS THERE'S NOTHING BUT PERFECT LOVE THERE. THAT'S ALL THAT WAS THERE. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, I'M MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER THAT IT WILL TAKE PERFECT LOVE TO PUT YOU IN THERE. OH, come on people. HOW MANY KNOWS IF YOU AIN'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S HARD TO FORGIVE SOMEBODY. IT'S HARD TO OVERLOOK SOMEBODY DOING you wrong. But if you GOT THE LOVE OF GOD IN YOUR HEART, AMEN. YOU CAN FORGIVE THEM. YOU CAN'T OVERLOOK THEIR FAULTS. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES, BROTHER BAM SAYS, MAN, WHATEVER YOU DO, LAY ASIDE EVERYTHING. HOW MANY BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO START LAYING SOME STUFF DOWN? AMEN. LAYING THE TIME, BRINGING BACK THE TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN ROBBED OF BY GOD, BY THE DEVIL. He robs us OF OUR TIME. LAY ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT &gt;&gt; AND THE SIN THAT DOES SO EASILY BESET US. LET US RUN THIS RACE &gt;&gt; THIS RACE THAT'S SET BEFORE US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let us run. We had barrel racing in this rodeo. Is that right? Sister Leicia said we didn't bring horses because you know somebody might get kicked in the head or something. She didn't say that. you know, we didn't bring horses, so we're going to use people. And we had SOME FUNNY LOOKING PEOPLE out there, didn't we? Amen. Little uh Jonathan and and I believe it's Michael HOLDING THEM AND THEY WERE RUNNING AROUND THEM BARRELS AND BOY, THEY WERE JUST GETTING IT. AND I think he fell down at the end. It was pretty humorous. Thank the Lord he didn't break his arm or something. BUT THEY WERE RACING TRYING TO GET FINISHED. PAUL SAID, "EVERYBODY RUNS IN THE RACE, BUT ONE WINS THE PRIZE." HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ought to do? Amen. YOU JUST DIDN'T FIND THEM OUT THERE HALFAPHAZARDLY JUST WALKING ALONG. NO, THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO WIN. HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT'S WHAT YOU AND I ARE TRYING TO DO THIS MORNING. WE'RE NOT JUST OUT THERE. AMEN. SEEING HOW SLOW WE CAN GO. NO, WE'RE HERE TO WIN. [cheering] WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS RACE. WE'RE GOING TO FINISH THIS THING. [applause] PAUL DIDN'T TALK ABOUT A SECOND AND A THIRD PLACE, DID HE? AMEN. NO, it was just the one THAT THE ONLY ONE WINS THE PRIZE. WE HAVE GOT ONLY GOT FIRST PLACE PEOPLE HERE. &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT MAKE THE RAPTURE AND THOSE THAT DON'T. AMEN. Let's run. Lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us. Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad that you've got the food to give you the vitamins to run? &gt;&gt; How many please? Let's give the Lord a hand for sending this message. Thank you Lord for sending this message. THANK YOU LORD FOR MALACHI 4. THANK YOU FOR SENDING US A PROPHET. THANK YOU GOD FOR vindicating your word. IT GIVES US RAPTURING [screaming] FAITH WHEN WE SEEN THAT WORD VINDICATED. YEAH. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; WOO. THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. VINDICATED WORD OF GOD. PROVEN WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; DON'T TRY TO TELL ME NOTHING DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; IT'S A BUNCH OF HOGWASH. THIS IS WHAT I LISTEN TO. This is what I believe. This is what I go [screaming] by. [applause] &gt;&gt; Cuz this interprets this. [applause] IS THIS THE INTERPRETATION of this? DIDN'T BROTHER B SAYS A PROPHET IS A DIVINE interpreter of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; People going around saying, "Well, you can't really believe everything that Brother Brandham taught. Can't believe everything he taught." I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he corrected his errors. I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. where you correct his errors. I don't believe it. &gt;&gt; Where he did, I believe it. &gt;&gt; BUT RAM SAYS, "MAN, IT'S THAT IMPORTANT, BILLY PAUL, THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I PREACH. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; We're either message believers or we're message unbelievers." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I'M GLAD THAT YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE RICH. YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE POOR. You ain't got to be whatever. Amen. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT YOU ARE. AMEN. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN HAVE. IT'S for you. &gt;&gt; This is something we can put on ourselves. A robe of his righteousness. [applause] How many believes it's lamp trimming time? Matthew 24. Amen. Let's look at that for a few minutes. Matthew 24:5 it says, "Then the kingdom of heaven is likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom." Remember, we're talking about checking, checking up time, trimming up time, laying aside every weight. Amen. Five of them were wise, and five were foolish. And they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. AND WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM TERRIED, they all slumbered and they slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him." And all those virgins AROSE AND TRIMMED THEIR LAMPS. Now notice THAT EVEN IT DIDN'T SAY HALF OF THEM, BUT IT SAID ALL THOSE TRIMMED THEIR LAMPS. NOW, HOW MANY KNOWS THE REASON YOU TRIM THAT LAMP IS TO GET THAT OLD BLACK STUFF, THAT SMUTTING, THAT BLACK STUFF OFF. AMEN. And when you GET ALL THAT CUT OFF, AMEN. WHEN YOU LIGHT THE FIRE, IT'S SO MUCH BRIGHTER AGAIN. IT DON'T SMOKE UP AS BAD. &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO TRIM OUR LAMPS. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Search down in your soul. See if you're pleasing to the Lord. How many believe and I may not get to it this but one of the big checklists that we have to have is the same one that Enoch had before he was translated. He had this testimony because that's what you and I are planning on. How many is getting plan on translating? What is that funeral home up here? That new one. Brother Brad Todd County funeral home. Thank you. I should remember that. Don't like to go in that place. Don't like that place very much at all. But I don't know about you, but I don't I HOPE THAT Y'ALL NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT ME LAYING THERE. Is &gt;&gt; that RIGHT? I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU LAYING THERE. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I hope one of these days when I jump off of there THAT BEFORE I HIT THE GROUND, I HAVE A BODY CHANGE. &gt;&gt; A MOMENT IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE. I HOPE WHEN YOU'RE SITTING THERE, YOU'LL HAVE A BODY CHANGE. [applause] WOO! THAT'S THE TRUTH. AREN'T WE ALL LOOKING FOR THAT? BUT LORD, CHANGE MY HEART. SEARCH MY HEART. SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY IN THERE TO JUST NOT PLEASING TO YOU. CUZ ENOCH HAD THIS TESTIMONY THAT HE PLEASED GOD. DON'T WORRY ABOUT PLEASING YOUR WIFE, YOUR HUSBAND, YOUR PASTOR. MAKE SURE YOU PLEASE GOD AND THEN YOU'LL DO ALL RIGHT BY ALL THE REST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. PLEASE GOD. SAY, "GOD, I [screaming] WANT TO BE PLEASING TO YOU." [applause] And you've got that little voice right on the inside of your heart tells you whether you're doing it or or you're not. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, I lost that pair. I got another one. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, notice, trim their lamps. And the foolish SAID UNTO THE WISE, GIVE US OF YOUR ALL, FOR OUR lamps are gone out. But the wise answered, "Not so, least there be not enough for me and you. Go rather to them that sell." In other words, go down to the altar and find it the way we found it. Amen. Go get it the way we got it. How many knows they won't never get it? You know why? Because they're not willing to come the way that you're willing to come. They want to still wear their clothes, still wear their makeup, still wear their earrings, have their tattoos, and go to these great big stadiums and pack it out 100,000 people and worship the Lord with the song, very songs you and I sing, &gt;&gt; worship like you and I wish almost like we could. How many knows they can worship? &gt;&gt; Don't tell me them people can't worship. They can fly worship, but so could the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. It ain't nothing new for him. HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT BEST. &gt;&gt; Hello But THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO SAY DIE TO THEMSELVES. THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEMSELVES. THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO LET IT GO DOWN IN THEIR SOUL. ARE YOU WILLING TO LET IT GO DOWN IN YOUR SOUL? THE VERY life that you LIVE IS WHERE GOD IS. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT'S ACCEPTED. BROTHER BENHAM SAID THERE'S NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT EXCEPT THE LITERAL LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST LIVING IN YOU. &gt;&gt; CHECKLIST TIME. IT'S TIME TO CHECK UP. THE WORKS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO. IT'S TIME TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR OF GOD'S WORD. And &gt;&gt; I've got a trick question for you. When you look at that mirror, whose reflection do you see? &gt;&gt; Zoe, do you see yourself? Michael John, when you look in the reflection of the word, do you see yourself? Remember, it's a trick question. Or should you be seeing the reflection of Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. IT OUGHT TO YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE JESUS. LET THE WORLD SEE JESUS IN YOU. WE DON'T WANT YOU. WE WANT JESUS IN YOU. THAT PAUL SAID, "THE LIFE THAT I NOW LIVE, I LIVE BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD. WHEN I LOOK IN THIS, I SEE MY LIFE REFLECTING JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's a good test for us. Check up time. See if you see a reflection of Christ. Amen. Why you think the Holy Spirit convicts you when you speak? Amen. I'm here to tell you. That's right. Just one of those things, isn't it? One of those things. Brother Brad confessed Wednesday. I'll go ahead and tell them. Is that all right? I would never forget. I'm going I'm going to have a little confession of my own. Not a long time ago, brother John. I was out on the far lane and we was going to Russellville, I think, or coming from and I was just cruising down the road passing somebody and over looked down brother John at least and John WAVES AT ME. OH, I FELT so bad. I felt so bad. I WAS LIKE, "OH, MAN, [screaming] THAT'S TERRIBLE. I'M THE EXAMPLE HERE NOW. HE'S BEING THE EXAMPLE." [panting] Didn't feel so bad when Brother Brad told us about the other day passing a cop. Me and my wife was coming home from Owensboro yesterday or day before. We just cruising along and we seen a couple cops calling on the ramp and we said in our lane just kept cruising. Amen. And directly here we come and here comes a cup passing us and they were just up ahead and I said, "Oh, wait." We wait. They come over in the right lane and was going to pass them cops and I says, "Watch this. Watch this. You're going to see the brake light." AND SURE ENOUGH, THEY CAME UP TO THE COPS AND I SAYS, "OH, that's right. That's right." They they're saying, "No, no, no. We're not passing. I'm just getting in the right lane, that's all. No, it's something. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many knows God convicts us of those small things? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't get away from the fact that Brother Abraham said, "When you speed, you sin." &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure all of us have a struggle with that because the cops even let you have five miles an hour. It's not It's hard not to take that five they give you or eight that they give you. WE ALL KNOW WHAT NOT TO GO. DON'T GO OVER 80 cuz you're liable to get it. But if you're under 80, it used to be I'd set mine on about 78, brother Red. I might as well be honest with you when I'm going on a long trip. No, I can almost pass them at 78 and not worry. Don't make it right. I'm here to tell you it feels a lot better when you set it on what you're supposed to set it on. Brother Brandon would have his fist back at Billy Paul. Amen. say, "Nah, he stayed five under." I don't stay five under. I'm not brother Brandham. I'll stay two under, maybe. As long as I'm under or on. Amen. But I'm just using that as an illustration. How many believes the Holy Spirit anything you say to people or do or example you said or whatever, the Holy Spirit convicts us? &gt;&gt; He does. He does. He'll talk to us much louder than what we realize if we'll just listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those little things. It's the little foxes that spoil the vine. Little foxes that spoil the vine. Amen. I thought these foolish virgins, what good does it do? What good does it do to trim some of this stuff off of your life? Well, I can dress better. I can keep this beat limit. I can do this, that, or the other. I I'll start doing these. I'll trim these things off. But what's what's more important than even that &gt;&gt; is that you have oil in your lamp. &gt;&gt; You can look righteous, do righteous, and be holy and all of that in the outward, but you got to have it down in here. You have to have oil in your lamp. How many's glad? &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'm glad that I've GOT OIL IN MY LAMP. HAVE HAS EVERYBODY HERE AT THE CHURCH GOT OIL IN YOUR LAMP? IF YOU DON'T HAVE OIL IN YOUR LAMP, JUST COME TO THE ALTAR. WE'LL STOP RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL PRAY FOR YOU CUZ WE WANT OIL IN YOUR LAMP. PART OF THE PREACHER'S JOB, AMEN, IS TO GET YOU READY. THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY IS FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAME. WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE TO SAY THESE THINGS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT PERFECT OURSELVES? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. BUT IT'S BEST FOR US TO CONFESS OUR OWN FAULTS, OUR OWN FAILURES. MAY IT HELP YOU TO REALIZE WE'RE NOT PERFECT EITHER. WE CAN BE PERFECT. AMEN. AS WE CONFESS OUR SINS AND AS WE PUT IT UNDER THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? THAT'S RIGHT. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE WITHOUT SIN, SPOTLESS, WITHOUT REBUKE IN THIS PRESENT WORLD. &gt;&gt; CHECKUP TIME. ARE YOU WASHED IN THE BLOOD? ARE YOUR GARMENTS WHITE? ARE THEY WHITE AS SNOW? AMEN. That's a good time to check. See if you're as white as snow. AMEN. ANOTHER [screaming] CHECK. ARE YOU JUSTIFIED? HOW MANY BELIEVE WHEN THEY GET OVER THERE, EVERYBODY? GOD'S GOING TO HAVE A CHECKLIST. AMEN. YOU DID THIS, YOU DID THAT, YOU DID THIS, YOU DID THAT. OH, YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU EVER DID. BUT AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT JUDGMENT DOESN'T START OVER THERE. IT STARTS RIGHT HERE. THIS IS JUDGMENT FOR YOU. AND I SAY, "GOD, I'M GUILTY. I PLEAD THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. FORGIVE ME OF MY FAILURES. FORGIVE ME OF MY SINS. FORGIVE ME OF MY SHORTCOMINGS. HELP me to overcome. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. LET YOUR SINS DROP IN THE BLOOD. AMEN. Let the records be erased. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ARE YOU JUSTIFIED THIS MORNING? JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming] &gt;&gt; IF THAT DON'T DO SOMETHING FOR YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL. TO KNOW THAT YOUR SINS ARE GONE. YOUR PAST IS ERASED. [screaming] [cheering] THAT'S RIGHT. CHECK IT. MAKE SURE IT'S DONE. IF IT'S DONE, YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT. I LIKE THAT CHECKLIST. [sighs] BE READY [screaming] FOR YOU KNOW NOT THE DAY OR THE HOUR. OH, [sighs and gasps] I COULD SAY THAT CALMLY, BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT. I BELIEVE IT OUGHT TO BE SCREAMED OUT. BE READY. IT COULD [screaming] HAPPEN ANYTIME. HE COULD APPEAR ANYTIME. &gt;&gt; BE READY. [sighs] [gasps] Have checked out. Checked up. Amen. Urban and Martha, they go on a lot of trips and I'm sure that they check their bags. Don't you reckon their clothes? Have you got your passport? HAVE YOU GOT YOUR WALLET? HAVE YOU GOT YOUR VISA CARD? HAVE YOU GOT THIS? HAVE YOU GOT THAT? HAVE YOU GOT A CHECK? CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S CHECKED OUT. CUZ I'M GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING. When you get to the airport, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER CHECKPOINT. THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK YOU OUT BEFORE YOU GET IN THAT FLIGHT. THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK YOU OVER GOOD. THEY'RE GOING TO X-RAY YOU. [laughter] [screaming] How many believe the Holy Spirit maybe is doing a LITTLE X-RAYING ON US THIS MORNING TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THERE THAT OUGHT TO BE THERE? SOMETHING THAT CAN'T GO ON THIS FLIGHT. WOO! BROTHER [screaming] BAM SAYS, "MAN, WHEN YOU GO TO PLACE YOU WANT TO MAKE RESERVATIONS, MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT A RESERVATION MADE. I WANT MY TICKET IN MY HAND. [panting] I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO GET A TICKET. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO GET A TOKEN. I WANT THE TOKEN IN MY HAND. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS MORNING I'M FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. I'M RIGHT WITH GOD. I'M READY TO GO IF HE COMES TODAY. &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; I want the token in my hand. [snorts] Wish I had my harmonica. Play a little harmonica. Make the sound of a train. Woohoo. It sounds better than that. Woohoo. Choo choo. That sounds better. Choo choo. That's right. BUT SAYS WHEN YOU'RE AT A TRAIN STATION, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HEAR THE WHISTLE. THE TRAIN IN THE BLOCK. THE PLANE'S ON ITS WAY. TIME TO GRAB [screaming] YOUR BAGS. TIME TO PUT THAT BAG OF PEANUTS DOWN. AMEN. AND GET READY TO GO. HOW MANY IT'S TIME TO GET YOUR EYES. AMEN. OFF OF THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. AMEN. AND START LIFT UP YOUR HEADS FOR YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWTH. N CHURCH. IT'S TIME TO START LOOKING UP. QUIT LOOKING DOWN HERE. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; START LOOKING up for our redemption is drawing nigh. &gt;&gt; The greatest moment. BROTHER TOMMY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. I KNOW ME AND YOU IS GOING TO RUN. WE'RE GOING TO JUMP. WE'RE GOING TO OH, MAN. AIN'T NO TELLING. AMEN. IF WE'RE IN LINE GOING UP THERE, WE MIGHT JUST GET OUT OF LINE AND do a LITTLE DANCE. AND I DON'T KNOW. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY CUZ WE HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO WIN. We're going to yell. WE'VE ARRIVED. WE'RE HERE. WE'VE WAITED ALL OUR LIFE FOR THIS. AND HERE WE ARE. AMEN. WE'RE IN HEAVEN. IMMORTAL, PERFECT STRENGTH, PERFECT YOUTH, NEVER NO OLD [screaming] AGE, NEVER ENOUGH FEELESSNESS, NEVER ENOUGH PRAYER. WE'RE GOING TO JUMP, SCREAM, AND SHOUT &gt;&gt; AND DANCE ABOUT. I'M GOING TO HAVE THE TIME OF MY LIFE WHEN THE TIME OF MY LIFE IS OVER. I'M GOING TO GET CARRIED AWAY WHEN I GET CARRIED away [sighs] [panting] [sighs] and I won't have to worry about catching my breath, brother. We're going to just keep on doing it for a while. [panting] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; It's checking up time. Amen. [sighs and gasps] Amen. It's checking up time, friends. [panting] If you'll listen to that tape, got a few minutes. I didn't actually print out some of the real heavy stuff that Brother Bram said in this message, but it was pretty strong. So, I'll read some of this other. I can't even find my notes anymore. All right, I got them folded up. But I'm going to go just a little longer and then we'll have communion. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; I'll finish try to finish with this. He's talking about this woman being married to a husband. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; He says, "Look, the church is lollying. The church has no conscience no more. You can't hardly wake them up." That's the way Brother Brham says, "You can't hardly wake the Baptist up, the Methodist up, the Presbyterian, the Pentecostal. Can't hardly wake them up." How many admits sometimes between Sunday and Wednesday and Wednesday and Sunday, sometimes we get to be a little sleeping. It takes a jolt of the Holy Ghost TO WAKE US BACK UP. GOD, GET ME KEEP ME. GET ME OUT OF THIS WORLDLY CAR WORLDINESS, THIS CARNALITY. GET ME OUT OF IT. SNAP ME OUT OF IT. TAKES ME A while just to get out of it. But he couldn't wake him up. But he said the Bible said that it would come in like that in this in these days they'll say, "Lo, he delayeth his coming." Amen. And he says, "I believe it was Sunday morning when I was preaching on the virtues of a woman hless. Who could find anything sweeter than to come home tired when God has given him a wife, a woman and a man is inseparable? They are one. Amen. Then he goes explaining in the creation, he made took him out of the dust of the earth and then made Adam out of her rib. Amen. And she's bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. They were one heart. And that's A TYPE OF CHRIST IN THE CHURCH. GOD DIDN'T take his church out of a creed or a denomination. He take it out of the heart of Christ. How many? Because that's what YOU'RE MADE OUT OF. THAT'S WHAT I'M MADE OUT OF. AMEN. HE COME OUT OF THE SIDE OF CHRIST. WHAT YOU'RE ENJOYING, THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT YOU'RE ENJOYING, THE CREATION THAT YOU'RE ENJOYING THAT GOD HAS DONE IN YOU. COME OUT OF THE VERY SIGHT OF ALMIGHTY C almighty God, Jesus Christ. Amen. And we're one. He says, could you imagine, I'll skip on. Could you imagine coming home of a nighttime tired, weary, worn? And if you're a farmer, mechanic, or a preacher, whatever you do, you come in and when you go to your little home, you're longing till you can get there. You open the door and that sweet LITTLE WIFE STANDS THERE. SHE GREETS YOU. She's all pretty and cleaned up. She walks over and kisses you on the cheek. SHE SAYS, "DAD, YOU'RE TIRED." SHE SETS YOU DOWN IN THE CHAIR, SETS HERSELF ON YOUR LAP. SHE PUTS HER ARMS AROUND YOU. SHE PATS YOU. And it just seems like then you're not tired anymore. Something picks YOU UP. SOMETHING THAT GOD GAVE YOU for that purpose. It's part of you. Amen. Now, if she's a true wife, Amen. How many wants to be a true wife? Don't you just love when you can sit on your recliner and say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus, for giving us a good service today. Thank you, Lord Jesus, FOR SPEAKING TO MY HEART TODAY. THANK YOU, LORD, FOR walking with me today. Thank you, Lord, in those things that I did AND WORKED TODAY. YOU HELP ME GET THEM DONE." AND just put your arms around Christ and tell him how much you love him. How sweet that is. How wonderful that How many enjoys the presence of God &gt;&gt; and walking with him and talking with him every day. BUT HE SAYS, "WHAT IF those lips has kissed another man that day or some other time? WHAT IF YOU'RE CONSCIOUS OF THAT? WHAT IF THE MAN'S arms has hugged another man? What if them arms has hugged another man? She's absolutely an abomination in your life. That kiss burns like Judas's kiss. Those arms, YOU'D RATHER THEY WOULDN'T BE AROUND YOU. OH, SHE MAY BE PRETTIED UP AND HER HAIR ALL CURLY AND HER EYES BROWN AND SO FORTH, cheeks all rosy, little skirts may be ironed, BUT SHE MAY BE SO PRETTY, BUT IF THAT REAL GENUINELY GOD respect and love and confidence isn't there, she'd better just stay off your lap. You don't want nothing to do with her. How many believes there's Amen. Marriage can be so wonderful and awesome. Amen. But if you have the wrong one or something like this, Amen. and it's better to stay single. Well, amen. Better to be single. I don't care HOW PRETTY SHE MAKES HERSELF, SHE'S still wrong until she's proven to be real, genuine, sweetheart, loving nobody but you. No other kiss from her lips but yours. No other arms must hold her yours. Amen. And you know it. What a feeling. What a consolation that is husband and wife, which is type of Christ in the church. And when you go to church, you may have the best pews in the city. YOU MAY HAVE THE HIGHEST STEEPLE IN THE CITY. YOU MAY HAVE THE best pipe organ. You may dress the best. You may sing like a MOCKING BIRD, BUT IN ALL OF THAT are you kissing and flirting with the world. That kiss on the cheeks of Christ is a Judas isgary and a kiss. He doesn't want nothing to do with you. He looks upon your wedding engagement. Amen. Ring and he finds the tablets has moved. He finds love has gone. It's a form. He finds loyalty is gone. You've committed fornications with the world. Go to Dan just boogie woogie. and what else? And which hopefully it's none of us for doing that, but maybe we've just gotten a little lukewarm. Amen. Listen, you're committing adultery with Christ, calling him your husband. You say, "I'm rich and greased with not I have I'm rich and have need of nothing." But said, "You don't know that you're miserable, poor, blind, and naked. It's time to light the candle and to sweep the house. The coming of the Lord is at hand." You remember Solomon when he spoke of it? He says, "Come, my love." AMEN. AND LET US WALK THROUGH THE POMEGRANATES. LET US WALK THROUGH THE garden of spices. Oh, how he said her lips looked like rose buds and so forth. He loved his little wife. COME, LET US GO AND TAKE OUR FILL OF LOVE. AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE ALTAR AND YOU PRAY, is your heart so true and your soul so unadulterated that you can say, "Lord Jesus, Lord God, LET US TAKE OUR LOVE. I LOVE YOU." AMEN. As brother Brandon many times at the end of his service say, I love him. I love him because he first loved me. YES, MY LOVER, I LOVE YOU. Or have you been committing fornication? Have you been flirting with the world? Amen. Up there. He said, he said, uh, he looks upon your wedding engagement ring and he finds a tablet move. He finds love. He's gone for his, he finds loyalty is gone. Have you committed fornication with the world? And so forth. And he talks about watching dirty television programs. And I thought, you know, you got to watch what you watch on your phone, don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Be careful. Amen. You watch the wrong thing, go to the wrong place, it's spiritual fornication. Amen. And then when you come to the house of God and sing a song, Amen. He feels like you're kissing a Judas is Scariot kiss. Ain't that right? How many wants to stay pure before the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. The hour of the Lord is at hand. When all these signs and wonders and tens of thousands of other things have taken place, pointing, every marker is pointing, it's getting dark. It's a cooling off of the church. Revival seems to be over. Amen. The last bit is about finished. And here we find ourselves, the church in adultery. Amen. And I didn't print it out, but he says, you know what? If that wife would come home, Amen. or the husband, he said, even if the husband would come home, been with some other woman and this that or the other, and have a venerial disease and everything else. And he talked about how the church has gotten to that place to where she comes in his presence and she's got a venerial disease. Amen. have worldlyism, pants on and everything else. Hello. And he was pretty pretty rank about it, but it's still the truth that when you go in the wrong direction and go in that way and the world, they think they can dress anyway, do anything, and it's a disease to God. How many knows he's not coming for that? He's coming for a virtuous bride, &gt;&gt; spotless, without spot, without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with the thought of the quote that I read to you at the beginning. where brother Abraham says that our hearts are what? They're not on the secondary. Everything that we have out here is secondary, but our hearts are set on one thing and that's the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our minds are set on the Lord. How many say, "God, I that's the way I want to be." Lord, purify my heart. Stand with me this morning. We'll change the order of service. [snorts] With your heads bowed, I think it's time to take a couple minutes to talk to the Lord. give you a chance if there's anybody that you don't feel like you're right with God, whatever it might be for whatever reason, the Holy Spirit convicts you. You know, I just don't know if I'd be ready to go if he would come in the next couple of minutes, but I want to be ready. I want to check up. I'm not where I ought to be. And I'm raising my hand. Say, God, purify my heart. Lord Jesus, you see my hands. You see all the hands up, God. That's right, Lord Jesus. When we really see the Holy Spirit, you show us our faults. And we certainly see the fault, Lord. If we can't see it, then I believe the devil has blinded us to our own faults. We're still human. We still make mistakes. We have shortcomings, Lord. But our hands are up, Lord, and saying, "God, I surrender all. Lord, take my heart. Take my life, Lord. I DON'T EVER WANT TO COME TO church and sing," Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. Or, "I love him. I love him with sin in my life. when I've done wrong and unconfessed OF MY SINS, GOD LEST NOBODY do that, Lord, and give you a Judas Iscariat kiss. We don't want that, Lord. But we want a pure and a holy kiss, Lord. To love you the way that we ought to love you, Lord Jesus. As a husband and wife, Lord, they're inseparable. There's nothing like it. And them two together, how wonderful it is when they think alike, they love each other. They care for each other, Lord Jesus. And that's the way we are, Father, with you. We care about you, Lord. And we ask, God, that you'd bless every heart and every hand now. And Father, as we're about to change the order of the service into the communion service, Lord, to remember what you did for us, Lord, that when they had opened dayside and when you paid the price, God, you made redemption possible for us to BRING US BACK INTO FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU AND TO RESTORE US to every right that Adam lost. Lord Jesus, only the changing of the body is all we're waiting for. And we want to remember Lord Jesus what you did for us on Calvary now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. How many loves you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes he spoke to us this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give him a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus. We worship you, Lord. We worship you. You're our all God. We love you." We put our arms around you and say, "Thank you, Jesus, for loving me. Thank you Jesus for loving me. Amen. Is everybody all right? &gt;&gt; Anybody want prayer before we go into the cult communion? Special prayer? Nope. All right. God bless you. You know what? How many believes that when you love God, you love one another? &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "I love you." &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; Look at each other and say, "I love you." I love you. I love you, brother Brad. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Love you, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love you with the love of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Turn your Bibles, if you will, to First Corinthians. would just go into this.
