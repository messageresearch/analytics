Fellowship dinner in between like usual okay so we're looking forward to that amen praise the Lord amen so let's just bow our heads and go before the Lord in prayer before we approach his word Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and father and taking the example of your prophet of how that Lord he'd always talk to the author before he opened the book for we realize Lord it is you that give the Revelation out of it Lord and anybody can open the Bible and read the words but father it truly does take you to Quicken it and make it real to us Lord so we ask father that you'll just take the words that we're about to open and about to read Lord Quicken it to our hearts say father what you once said Lord and minister to the needs of everybody in here of God you are such an awesome God you know the thoughts and intents of each and every one heart today and right here tonight and we pray God that you would just speak to our hearts Lord father as only you can do and we open them up Lord we open up our minds we open up our hearts and our ears so that you might speak to us and that we might have ears to hear that we might have eyes to see Lord Jesus and that we might be able father to Fathom what you have for us tonight Lord bless our me the meditation of our heart now that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to minister help us God to do it by the inspiration that you also Supply to do it with Father Lord we ask for all those listening Lord streaming we ask your blessing upon them May may they receive from your word tonight Lord also in Jesus name amen and amen kind of a different message tonight amen and so um if you will turn your Bibles because I want to speak on one of them amen I think it was Sunday night amen early Monday morning I woke about 3:30 and I got the thinking of how glad I was that I was one of them amen and I just got a few different thoughts different lines that begin to pour out and so I says well maybe that's what the Lord wants me to speak on tonight so amen I just thought one of them and you know the song that says one of them and so I I wondered where in the world that one of them come from and so I don't know really where it did come from I hadn't done any research to see where it just came from but maybe it is from what I where I read where we're fixing to read amen amen how many knows that the inspiration of God and the holy spirit amen it uh uh it it it is going to be there as long as there's a church that God is dwelling in amen that inspiration is uh to all generations amen and so if you will we'll turn to the Book of Matthew tonight to the Book of Matthew 26 amen amen 26 in we'll begin with verse 69 Matthew 26 and 69 now Peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also was with Jesus of Galilee but he denied before them all saying I know not what thou sayest and when he was gone out of out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto him that were there this fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth and again he denied with an oath I do not know the man and after a while came came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter surely thou also art one of them one of them for thy speech betrayeth the then began he to curse and to swear saying I know not the man and immediately the crew and Peter remembered the word of Jesus which said unto him before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and he went out and wept bitterly may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this evening Amen in Romans 6 and I'll read Romans 6 1-5 also what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Jesus a Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so also we shall walk in newness of light life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection amen and I was going to hold off on this other scripture but I'm going to go ahead and read it 2 Timothy 2 and 11 it says it this well it says it this way 2 Timothy 2 and ver1 it is a faithful thing saying that if we be dead with him we shall also live with him amen if we suffer we shall also reign with him and if we deny him he will also deny us amen amen Peter here we find that he was in a very very hard place isin't that right because no doubt but what they were doing with Christ with Jesus their Master at the time wasn't a very pleasant thing isn't that right I mean they had taken him off and they was going to crucify him and bad things were going to happen to him and people Peter amen with just a uh you know he he was not converted yet and he did wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost is that right and he didn't have the courage and he uh uh it was he was told by even Jesus himself because Jesus knew what Peter would do is that right I told him n you know because he was very very exuberant is that right Peter was you know and so amen amen but anyway so very zealous for the Lord and when the Lord told him that he was going to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and they're going to crucify him and all that you know and uh he said Lord don't know and that that never happen and when they came to get him ain't that right when they came to get Jesus well Jesus I don't know where Peter got the sword from but he grabbed the sword a't that right amen and so um he went went Troy's going to of course I don't think he was aiming for the year amen that's why I've nicknamed the Trump shooter Peter aimed for the head and only got the ear so but anyway so you know he was he was he was willing to kill somebody for his master and so forth he was very much that way and here he finds himself they had taken him anyway it didn't go the way that he planned and I think one place brother Bram talked about how that uh all of his followers you know and and they were in a absolute horrible place of depression and I don't know just how I'd have to go back and Pi pull it up where brother Brandon describes it but they had been completely disappointed because of how things had went I mean you talk about a church falling apart ain't that right I mean they just completely fell apart and everybody went their own way and went fishing and everything else and they had questions about wow I we thought that he was going to be the Messiah going to do all this and it wasn't the way they thought it was going to be amen and you know I think that's such an important lesson for all Christians and all religious people to understand that a lot of times God is going to do things the way that you don't think he's going to do it and if you aren't open to God's way amen and for changing your mind amen you're going to be actually found in a bad place of No Doubt persecuting or coming against God Amen so you have to keep a comma behind what you believe amen because God will do things and it didn't even brother Bram said you know it said but as soon as you think you got it figured out no there's one thing you're going to be wrong so we in the message even oh we got it all figured out you better just be careful you ain't I got it all figured out amen we're living by faith one day at a time isin't that right amen but Peter here and we look at that and I like that verse there because he said you're one of them so he was identified with a certain group and tonight we're going to focus on that talking about identity for a little bit because you know there's a lot of different groups of people a lot of different categories of people isn't that right amen we want to look at some of those categories for a little bit if we could amen we want to look at the 70 amen that uh followed him for a while but then they didn't is that right and mean we want to look at just Judas even even Judas who was with him for a while then betray him so let me just start with reading a quote brother bam says many of them followed him because the first part of his ministry he went from church to church and though they gladly received him and they gave him a great hand oh Rabbi you're a great fellow isn't it about what we did in our generation as long as there was healing campaigns thousands upon thousands of people followed Ain that right my Arkansas and you Missouri all those places just so many people but when he begin to preach the seals talking about denominationalism is the mark of the beast he got really really really strong in the seals ain't that right says denominationalism is actually the mark of the beast because denominations don't go on with God they stop at a certain place and when you stop at a certain place amen you stop with God and you take the mark of unbelief and so after that we find after 63 that one place in Phoenix I believe it was brother B said you know he's been there for uh three years and hardly had any place no place open cuz they had put him out completely amen so we find that same thing even today you know because you know because and and this is one thing that brother I find here brother Brandon when he was speaking about this I'm going to speak to kids now teenagers could you identify yourself today is that right because we know as our teenagers grow up and amen they come to 18 20 years they have to they have to decide what they're going to be they have to find their identity so to speak cuz we certainly have an identity crisis today don't we and you and I we can smile because why because you don't have an identity crisis I don't have an identity crisis I am so thankful that I know who I am right I'm glad that I know who I follow because you're going to be somebody's fool so whose fool is he going to be you're either going to be God's fool or you going to be the devil's fool one or the other there's only two that you can be a fool for Paul said I'm a fool for Christ amen and so you have to decide you have to make that decision in your teenage years what are you going to be amen and it all depends on what God has placed down in your soul ain't that right oh my how many's glad that you go you don't have a problem with identification amen so I'm not notice here that's right so he says that's right as long as he was everything going good you know but one day he sat down with scriptural truth and then he identified himself not as only as a Healer but as a man sent from God with truth and life he identified himself oh that uh and that was against their tradition even to many that followed him the 70 turned and went away isin that right he says then brother ask says what would you have done think of it when a man that you've seen done mared the signs of the Messiah know that the Messiah was coming prophesy this was all going to happen even to John to Baptist in them and he'd expressed it thoroughly and you'd followed him and seen the Great Signs of the Messiah proving that none of the pastors could withstand the message at all and then all once he says he comes around and teaches something that's contrary to the uh that's exactly according to the word of God but contrary to the way that you've been taught then you hold to your tradition would you go with the 70 see the scriptures it's a clear-cut word but would you go with the 70 or can you see now your identification now we know that Jesus said that anybody that would deny me I will deny him now we know Peter denied him didn't he did him three times he denied him but how many how know no wonder Peter could be real happy because guess what it went now he went out he didn't want to but he just couldn't take he just couldn't uh confess him at the time it was too hard for him but he went out and wept bitterly there was repentance there God knew his heart isn't that right oh he knew he would do it but Peter oh you know we know that God Amen had him to be one of the main pillars of the church ain't that right praise the Lord so and and and of course we know after the day of Pentecost he wasn't so ashamed anymore he wasn't so afraid anymore it's kind of like a lot of people you know if you're not truly born again and and and and and and people ask you you know one of the first things people ask you if you talk god or scriptures what what church do you go to what church do you go to am man you see while I go to evening light Tabernacle Oh you mean them [Music] Brites huh that's right that's right think about that's right you're branded how many Believers everybody's brand I want to tell you something everybody's branded you're going to be branded for something cuz by their fruits you shall know them the life that you live shows who you are that's right it absolutely you can't get away from it and you are in one of these categories of people there's a lot of different categories of people today isn't that right birds of a feather flock together amen so I wrote down here What bird are you what bird are you brother Glenn that's what I was looking for that's right I'm an eag amen SAR Above All the Rest amen s above the things of the world above the clouds above the sounds and the noise of the world that's right and what do eagles do eagles eat fresh Mana they don't eat something they're not that way they they know how to kill something theirself they ain't got to go to church to get a revelation no they get it on Monday Tuesday Wednesday amen they can get their own food they don't rely on well I just don't never get fed well then why don't you learn how to feed yourself one of the first things you teach little kids is how to take that spoon and then not shove it up your nose and everywhere else you say hit the mouth hit the mouth that's right and after a while they're feeding theirself oh Caleb I remember when he was little we had spaghetti on his little tray and he had it all over himself you can see other pictures are probably your kids you let them sit down there and eat it and they got it everywhere but in the mouth almost but after a while hello how many knows that if you're going to be spiritually strong you got to be eagle and you're going to have to feed on spiritual things amen we don't here at church we don't I can't live off of Amen my revelation of yesterday and the other day and the other day amen Eagles feed on Fresh Revelation fresh meat amen tonight we're eating on fresh meat called one of them oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them amen some people sit there and oh man they seem so sad that they're one of them I don't want to be sad that I'm one of them I'm glad I'm one of them wo I'd rather be an oldtime Christian and anything I know you can be whatever you want to be but just let me be identified with Christ and if you're identified with Jesus Christ in the burial amen into the water you go amen up you come in newness of life if you're ashamed to be identified with him today come and says I'm ashamed of you I don't know you you might get to heaven and say oh I did this and I did that he'll say no I just I don't know you he'll be ashamed of you you you denied him somewhere along the road see folks we're not going to be here that long I mean we can't keep going the prophet said we're at the end we're at the end we're at the end and we're see these scriptures coming to pass folks you better be ready for what's on the other side amen I want to be one of that I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ Paul said I'm not ashamed to be a Christian them people over there at the supper amen at the Olympics they weren't ashamed to mock God go ahead and don't be ashamed whatever you're going to do it do it with all your heart but said if I wasn't for him I'd be against him why because the hell's going to be good and hot for you amen it'll be just right for you that's right you'll reap what you sow Jesus Christ was always been mocked he was mocked he was spit upon he was made fun of he's still spit upon he's still mocked don't expect Christianity not to be mocked how many those thousands came out and over there again and and were just worshiping the Lord and protest all of that they don't show a whole lot of that do they no amen how many's glad to be a Christian amen I'm glad to be identified as a gbac yeah that's right I'm a gbac well what's a gbac a genuine born again Christian W that's right a genuine unadulterated pure pure bread Thoroughbred Christian born From the Inside Out by the power of the Holy Ghost transformed into a Son of God that's who I am called to be a minister called to proclaim the gospel of Christ to bring Jud judgement and mercy Ain that right judgment to those who reject God Mercy to those who accept him amen praise the Lord we're not called to be a crow a crow brother maam says can come to church wo praise be to God wow amen tears coming down your eyes W praise be to God and go out there and do all kinds of wickedness go out there and feed on the wrong thing butam called a hypocrite amen but a genuine Dove is what we're represented hello a dove can't feed on the carry and it has to have the pure word of God Amen that's why you sit there and you amen when it's a word of God and it's the truth Amen Let me give you my opinion and you shut your down that right give you my opinion I don't want your opinion brother B I want the word of God I'm a Dove I want the pure word of God Amen all right praise the Lord so listen see what your identification where would you stand now think deeply sincerely amen he says where would you stand now with your present condition what group would you be identified with or could you identify yourself could you identify yourself with that amen then he talks go says I want to speak to people what do you identify as amen CU if you identify as a Christian then you're a representative of God of all Christianity that's a great responsibility isn't it that's exactly right you want to every thought every action that you got Amen to line up with the word let my every action speak amen praise the Lord amen but first think about it amen he said here if you're buried with him and by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father so shall we also walk in newness of Life how many believes that you get buried if you and even take up the cross if you take up the cross like he did amen J Jesus said that that no servant is above his master if they have called me be elub what are they going to call you brother John what if somebody calls you a you're a nothing but a devil you're a devil can you imagine you're a devil somebody call you a devil you're following a false prophet woo Glory they called my master the chief of devils so if you get called one Rejoice the Bible says if they persecute you and if they despitefully use you rejoice that you're count it worthy to suffer for Christ's sake don't expect them to say oh you're such a wonderful guy let me Pat you on the back the world ain't going to do that they'll cast your name out as evil the Bible says try to say something evil about you wo hello but says if you can't say something good about somebody don't say nothing at all so when you find somebody cutting somebody else fell down and almost saying all kinds of ass thing that that remember where they're identifying themselves as amen because the Bible says as you have done one of these my little ones you've done it unto me how many believes that all right let me back up just a little bit we're going 150 M hour we're going to go down to about 30 all right we're going to slow this thing down and bring it back down to amen where we need to be with the help of the Lord in Matthew 13 I want to go look at a group in Matthew 13 a group of people amen got some good stuff right here Matthew 13 we'll begin with Verse 18 actually let's just uh go back to verse three and he spake many things unto them in Parable saying Behold a swer went forth to sew and when he sowed he SED a seeds fell some feed self by the wayside and the fowls that came and devoured them up some of them fell on Stony places where they had not much Earth and for with they sprung up because they had no depth of Earth and when the sun was come up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up and choked them but others fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some 100 fold and some 60 amen remember they desired that he would explain this to them why do you speak to us in terrible Parables and so forth in verse 18 hear ye therefore the parable of the S when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catch away that which was sown in his heart heart and this is he which had received seed by the wayside they barely get out the doors before they forget what they heard hello I don't know about you don't you like uh who was it I think it was brother Jesse talking about brother brandham having gotten a revelation on how he lived on it for about a week ain't that right or lasted two weeks that man I just I just fed on that for a couple of weeks some people don't even feed on until they get home they don't forgot what was said I don't know about you but don't you like to hear something and me come down into your heart that you can feed on it for a while it lasts for a while that really means something to me don't let it just fall by the wayside don't be in a category of those Fall by the wayside or amen it's just taken away amen then of course he says next of all but not notice verse 20 but he that receiveth the seed into the Stony place is the same as he that Hearth the word and ano with joy receiveth it woo Glory kind of like the children of Israel when they amen was over across the Red Sea isn't that right they got over there and Miriam and all of them boy they rejoiced dancing and all all of these things oh they had Joy receive it yet hath not root in himself amen but doth for a while for when tribulation and persecution arises because of the word by and by He Is offended now the Bible says it is impossible but that offenses will come for a Christian that right but W by whom the offenses come the one that's causing the offenses woe to him but you are going to get offense offenses are going to come we even as good Christians sometimes offend each other is that right and if you ain't got root amen I call it the buy and buy group or the babby group huh there's a group that I call the bye-bye group they just don't last very long I don't care what you do you know all right bye-bye group just by and by they're offended off they go remember the illustration brother and I think is even the Bible talks about casting a net into the ocean catch all kinds amen Turtles and and lizards and fish and this that or the other and you know some of them come up there and sit down there and say that's right praise the Lord I thank God for p picking me up for for delivering me out of the ocean and that right oh they Rejoice for a while but then it don't go the way they think and wiggle their way back out into the ocean buying buyers end up going back where they were before they ever come amen I don't know about you but I don't want to be one of them no I don't want to be one of them no root but he that receiveth seed among the Thorns is also he that heareth the word and the uh and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and becometh unfruitful Lord I don't want to be one of them don't let my money don't let my Prosperity get the better of me don't let my good business or whatever it might be am me cause me not to be able to come to church not be able to worship the way that I ought to get away from God no don't let those things choke out oh my I was telling my wife and sitting on the front porch I says we're blessed people you know and this persecution that's coming upon the Christians and that's right by our own government and everything else that's coming I said you know man they used to live in caves and in dens of the Earth for a thousand years they gave their lives and had to dive a't that right we get that have it pretty good prosper and everything else hello we've got it nice in that manner amen so let's serve him with all we got let's not be in the lukewarm group how many believe there's a lukewarm group there's a Le out ofia Rich increased with goods and have need of nothing but spiritually they wretched miserable poor blind and naked and the worst part of it all is they don't know it isn't that something that's the craziest part is they're all of that and they don't even know it that's why when they come up there before the father they'll say look I spoke in tongues I I did this out the other yeah but I sent you El Elijah the prophet and you wouldn't even hear him I'm afraid for anybody that is ashamed of God's angel that was God's messenger the angel of the Lord was with him 247 watching out for him he'd never come to this platform in this pulpit and then God forsook him no he didn't come did you ever read a tape listen to a tape where he said says no he didn't come tonight I thought he was going to come but he didn't come never never will you find a quote like that why cuz he always came God always came oh my now I'm here to tell you just because amen some people have their own ideas they lean to their own understanding they want it their own way I wish they'd be listening tonight it's going to be bad for you on the Judgment Day real bad when God took his own picture with him the pillar fire took his picture with him when he's being criticized and that that that that man was trying to put his finger up there and trying to get a picture and show Mr best I believe it was and me show that he's the big one and that's the only picture that developed I'm not ashamed you want to call me a brand ofite call me whatever you want I'm a Christian Amen brother briham said that we are Christians we don't take out another name as a matter of fact I'll tell you this back in Ezekiel 9 it says go through the city and those who sigh and cry amen for the Abominations that s said they put a mark in their head amen over there in Revelations 12 I believe it is say it says put a seal upon their forehead over in Revelations 22 he says then said they've got their they've got his name in their foreheads God help us to realize the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not a man this that or the other we're married to Jesus Christ we are Miss Jesus Christ that name means everything to us he's everything he's everything to me and that name we don't go by anywhere identified with acts 238 repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Amen in Jesus name how many believes you in Jesus name that's where it is right in here some will get mad at you they want Father Son and Holy Ghost they want to go back to titles hello like brother Braham says she said you know uh come to that uh I believe it was into the hospital and and the lady said pull that curtain pull that curtain well aren't you a Christian I'm Methodist huh you might be Baptist you might be Amish you might be menite might be this out or the other you've got some brand on you but I want the brand of Christian born again Bible believing Christian amen we're not bramit but we are his converts we're Jesus ites we're Messi hates married to Jesus Christ amen so you got to be identified ified with something you're going to be something who are you what are you going to be I'm so thankful for this next verse but he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also bringeth forth fruit amen some and bring it forth some hundredfold some 60 and some 30 you don't want to be identified as a quitter identified as somebody that lets the cares of this world choke out the word in you amen and I thought as I was studying this why is it this way what is the problem the problem is not with the seed in each one of these it's never the seed's problem it's always the soil's problem the soil is not deep enough and anybody that brother Brad he does Plants anybody knows that you got to have so much soil for those roots to grow you've got to have depth of Earth amen hallelujah well brother about how can I know that I'm in this part well first of all you're going to bear fruit Jesus said by their fruits she shall know them by what people do you know them by what you do you can know yourself is that right we need to inspect ourself so much easier to see either everybody else amen but putting them glasses on backwards now that's the hard part amen me said me seeing out there turn that thing around and let me look at myself here is that right that's so hard it gets all blurry because for some reason everybody thinks that they're all Angels They're All Saints we in our own eyes we see ourselves too righteous sometimes and I'm here to tell you it takes the isav of the Holy Ghost on your eyes to make you realize what you really are how you really are whether you're lukewarm or not whether you're kind of naked now is't that right not really dressed in the robe of his righteousness remember there was a wedding ceremony given invitation given and I was a whole group of people they were all invited and they came in with their invitation amen is that right isn't that how you come Lord you said whosoever will let him come I'm bringing my invitation Here I Am Lord am mean I come to your supper I'm coming to your wedding amen but when the Lord come and he checked everybody else there was somebody in there didn't have the wedding garment as brother bam said in the orience and so forth when you come to that wedding you give them the invitation and they bring you in and they put a robe on you they put a certain robe on you and I don't care if you're rich poor I don't care what you are you look like everybody else y all look the same how many knows that's the way with the baptism of the Holy Ghost when God puts a robe on you there's no big eyes and no little use we're all one group but there was a one in there that did not have the robe and he says how did you get in here sir and he was speechless how many knows there's a lot of people that is trying to get into heaven their own way and boy are they going to be disappointed when he comes up there I never knew you depart from me you haven't got the robe on and Lord help me to wear the robe I want to be a robe wearer robe of his righteousness dress in his righteousness back to our thought how do I know well first of all how long have you been a Christian how long have you been a Christian how many trials have you had how hard has it been what all did you go through and then the final question where are you where are you a lot of people ain't nowhere to be found but if you're still there you still love God that means that he had to have some root tribulation distress and everything else couldn't shake you from it and you're part of that group that brings forth a hund fold that's the group I want to be with I want to be one of them that bring forth a h hundredfold and that has Deep Roots when I think of that with deep roots brother brand I think you know oh my a mule brother Braham says mule little you know he's he can't breathe himself back he can't have any children he can't go anywhere he's just dead he's just done he'll wait for his dying day to kick you ain't that right he's trying to wiy like a horse don't sound too good does it no but Braham said but you talk talk about you know the old the old meal days of Miracles is passed no more miracles there's no Holy Ghost but for the 12 so sad going to a church where there's a bunch of mules hybrids yeah like brother BR said about the modern Church they don't want none of these here screaming shouting acts 238 young ones around her is that right amen aren't you glad you're one of them I'm glad I'm one of them they don't want you around but God does they don't want no screaming shouting young acts 238 because that's the only kind of word brings forth amen but you take a genuine horse when he's like a horse you know comes up to you and snuggles on you like a horse amen runs like that you know boy I like to see my Donna's horse run sometime even that Little Pony man he can go 100 mile hour that little guy I don't know how he gets him feet moving so fast that's right but says he knows where he come from he knows where he's going how many of I talking to tonight you know where you come from you know where you're going you know where your grandfather was your great great great grandfather your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world when God when John John the Revelator identified himself when he seen his name on the book he began to shout and scream and amen he says everything in heaven everything under heard the under the Earth heard me say glory and honor and power be to him that live he had a Running Fit when he realized who he was and that his name was on the book they me Peter and them back they came back rejoicing because the Devils were subject to him he says don't worry about that don't be so happy about that but Rejoice because your names are written your roots go deep we didn't start this race to stop now no we're going all the way are you with me we're in the group that goes all the way to the end he that endureth to the end shall be saved we're indoors you know the good part brother Glenn I always get him talking sister so don't get on him to him I'm the one that picks on him almost forgot my thought I can't help it you can't help it it is God that put that ground in there how many believe it's God that put that deep dirt in there it's God that put that dirt in there amen allow that route to go deep it's called predestination a little bit of forn knowledge amen he knew what these guys would do those buying buyers they wouldn't really want him they'd burn out so we just give them enough root little enough soil to get happy is that right but the real elected how many's glad that your root goes deep your soil is very deep you're part of that group you're one of them go listen to that identification butam talks about it if you've been identified amen with his death his burial anden you'll be identified in his resurrection I wrote down here you you know you might be spit on on for him but guess what we're going to sit with him also aren't you glad for that if you suffer with him you'll also reign with him you might have the lowest name the lowest job like he did amen I don't care about being first I don't want to be first I want to be last I got y'all's attention now how can I be first you'll never be first until you last first you first got to be last let me put that in a little bit pler English if it helps you you first got to be last and then you'll be first CU Jesus said the first shall be last and the last shall be first so does that are first oh they got to be Top Dog they got to be this that or the other I don't care if I'm nothing but the doorm I'm just just a doormat guess what when I get over there I'll sit with him on the throne amen he took the lowest job he took the lowest name be elub and God exalted his name to be above every name there's no name in the universe or in any other dimension that is higher than Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the greatest name that there is why don't they mock the muhamad and the Buddhist and all these why don't they mock them well that's on their side why would they mock them no they'll mock the real thing the one that's not with them they know who their enemy is amen my my my buried be willing to be last we don't have to be left first I could go to those scriptures where it talks about blessed those that are uh hungry now a't that right for they shall be filled persecuted now all these other things Jesus blessed are you blessed are you if you're this this this this this never first and the greatest not in this this world but I'm here to tell you how many believes one of these days one of these days it's going to change amen when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more and that morning breaks Eternal bride and fair when his chosen ones Shall Gather over on the other Shore When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll be there how many wants to be there do I want to be in that group that's going to be be there Lord that's what I want to be I want to be in that group I'm in that number oh thises just come to me I'm in that number I'm in that number robed in white folks I don't got to be there first I don't care if I'm last I don't care where I just I'm there amen how many just wants to be there that's right and so I don't mind being identified as a Christian being identified with him and his sufferings or whatever it might be that's right but you have to be identified with him in these ways if you're going to be with him over there amen praise the Lord amen all different categories of people Billy Graham brother bam says Oral Roberts and them preach to the lot the Lites not so much the sodomites but the lot a't that right those two angels went down to Sodom says that was Abraham I mean Abraham Billy Graham and all Roberts but there was another group there was another Angel up by Abraham and Sarah and he was Discerning the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart in the tent behind him and the prophet of God when he was ministering one time he says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he says to prove that God is the same I'm going to turn my back to the audience and he begin to discern the thoughts and intents of the hearts of the people that doesn't make brother brandham God or anything special it makes Jesus Special AM mean it was Jesus Christ that came and did that very same thing and what were they called the elect group amen I want to be part of that elect group not the lot and so forth but the elect group praise the Lord I want my banner to be clear I wrote down here I don't want people to have to figure out what I am you know that's about true today you got to figure out what people are amen you go

anybody that don't know for sure what they are are miserable but you know who you are you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're a son and daughter of God Amen not ashamed to proclaim the truth to the world Amen I want it to be clear of what I am Lord help me to be clear so that those around me will clearly understand and see exactly what I am how many's with me on that not be ashamed they're not
