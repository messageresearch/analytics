want to remember sister Donna she's home recovering continue to remember my wife and prayer that the Lord will continue to heal her body and we just thank him for what he's done and also remember Sister parish and sister Peggy are shuttin tonight and we want to just greet those that are streaming tonight and I know that they are and brother Steve and sister Becky they're still on the menend so we want to continue to remember them in prayer tonight and also brother Shawn is not feeling well we want to remember brother Shawn in prayer tonight that the Lord will touch his body and also uh brother Tommy put on our brother's page T today that we'd remember brother Andrew Spencer he down in his back and he's heard his side somehow or the other so he asked that we'd remember him tonight in prayer and also we I had turned in a prayer request about my oldest brother Daryl and uh the cancer the spot on his nose turned out to be cancerous so he desires your prayers and I I've got to see I think it's either this coming week or the end of the month that he has to go for the surgery so just remember him in in your prayers if you have need on your heart you might let it be known with uplifted hands amen and we're going to ask brother John Wade if he'd pray over the offering in these needs tonight ch for amen and there was one request I didn't think I would forget because I didn't write it I didn't write it down but as many of you have noticed my grandson hasn't been to church lately and he's kind of got away from talking to us again and so we just desire that you'd remember Mark that the Lord would just speak to his heart again and I don't really know what all is going on with him he hasn't had much to say I talked to him the other day day and he just said he was going to start calling and stuff but he's not so he's going he's in a real battle so just continue to remember him in prayer and I know that God's done something for him and and uh just remember him in your prayers if you don't care and my son Micah and the Lord's working on him and every time he calls me about something I tell him I say well let me just tell you the best thing to do pray and he started praying and I he told me the other day I'm going to tell this on him and he said boy dad sometimes it don't work like you think it would I said no son God doesn't answer it when you want it done he answers it when it's time and he seen God move and he's seen his hand and uh you know he's hardhead like his dad so God's just going to have to do a little extra work like he did me sometimes he you know some kids you can tell them you know parents and they do it other kids you know it's a constant reminder that's kind of the way I am and unfortunately he he got that for me so just continue to pray for him and you know I we s brother Josh sings that song our family is sealed I believe that tonight I believe God's going to give us our children I don't know what they got to go through when they go through a trial I just say Lord if that's what you got to do let it go because you know what if they're the richest people in the world and they don't have God they're nothing but if there are the poorest people in the world and they have Jesus they're the richest people in the world they have everything you don't get anything better than eternal life and so I just believe that for my children and this song Come On My Heart tonight when we all get to heaven that's what we're looking for you know we look at our parents some of them are G on and we're looking for that day but you know I want us all to be there together I want to be there on that day and and I remember brother John because I've known brother John since he was as big as Jonathan I remember him when he was that small and you know and I think what is it going to be when we get over there don't you want to be there amen there's just something in my heart and I said Lord just draw us all closer together and

have your seats for a moment there and we want uh I got some some reading and quotes that I want to share with you as we get started and and uh I don't know how long we will we're try not to keep you along tonight and and uh you just pull and I'll preach and when you're done pulling I'm done preaching so that's the way that works and we'll just uh do it at that so I was thinking about this and this is a little subject I want to look at tonight and a topic that I've been wanting to preach on for last little bit few months maybe and and um just didn't never really fit in or feel like it was the right time and and I just tell you just a little confession this uh on myself uh you know I I do pretty much a regimented schedule and have for the last little bit and so mornings I get up at usually a set time a certain time I do I pray I read and I I study I do this I do that and I'm all regimented up until a certain time and then it's kind of free day well you know yesterday I I I got up and I just thought to myself I'm not doing this today I'm I'm just not doing this today I'm I'm not I'm not exercising I'm not reading I'm not I'm not going to study I'm not going to I'm not going to listen to my motivation I'm not I'm not doing none of that I'm just not going to do it so I just literally sat and was just slothful and lazy all day yesterday has any of y'all ever ever done that so as the day goes on I begin to you know I'm thinking about the service today I know I got to preach and I'm thinking about what I what I want to preach on and and so I'm just going through the day and the more the day goes the more I'm getting angry with myself I'm getting down on myself why why did I do that this is not this is not the way I operate what What mo you know why did I do that and I'm going on and said we go to bed and I tell Joy I said you know what I'm just discouraged I'm I'm just just upset with myself I said because I was just wasted the entire day being slothful and lazy and I didn't accomplish a single thing and I thought to myself and I'm I'm thinking why I said now I've got to work harder I've got to work double time because I've got to make up for where my laziness was and so as I'm sitting there and I'm thinking about that so we go to sleep and I wake up this morning and I'm back on track going want and to do this and I do that and I get ready I go get ready to do my my little exercise and jog I get my motivational and I listen to different speakers and one I listen to is Jim ran I think some of you probably have heard of him listen to him and the first thing he says is if you're living a life of laziness and and you've lost your way you need to focus and get yourself back into the vision and I thought thank you Lord and then as I began to think about that I began to think about the story and and the illustrations I want to use tonight and I thought you know what sometimes we just have to go through things really we don't maybe know why we don't know why we do some of the things we do but it all falls into place songs that were sang things that were said things tonight that have been said and done uh even down to the very fact of the group of people that's here you say well we're small in numbers well how many believes we can be Mighty and Power power amen so you know when we look at this and I begin to think I begin to think on the character of Joseph and I've been wanting to preach on this a while so I began to study and look and see what the what the prophet said about him and just want to read this to you before we get into the word he says real quickly I got to get to another character he said I see one before me now his name is Joseph he was an elected son he was a perfect type of Christ he was born a prophet he was a prophet and now he could see visions and he he was yet a little boy and he saw a vision of himself sitting on a throne and his brothers bowing to him see but watch he become he felt like he was a a great guy he said but what did God have to do he done the same thing that he did to the rest of them he said because Moses was a deliverer Paul was a deliverer Joseph now a deliverer he saved his people from the famine but what did God have to do to him he put him in prison he said he put him straight right in the prison yes sir he said remember he was sold by his Brethren to the Egyptians they slded him to piiper and now Piper gave him a little bit of Liberty and the first thing you know it was taken from him he said and there he sat in the prison crying and crying and God had stripped it he said but now notice all the time all the time I believe he was in that prison he could remember that the vision said he was going to sit on a throne you see we may go up and we may go down and we may wonder why we wonder why we're at where we're at today but the vision says we're be at a married the vision said when he was in the prison that he was going to be sitting on a throne and the vision says that his brothers are going to bow down to him because he says he knew his gift came from God and he knew that was it and it had to come to pass woo that's rich Genesis CH 37 if if you want to turn there let's let's read let's stand if we could once again and and as we read you know we the prophet said we we stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in our national anthem we ought to stand when we read the word of the Lord Genesis chapter 37 and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan and these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his Brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilha the sons of Zila and his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report so when we think about this here here we got a 17-year-old coming back and bringing a report of wrongdoing okay this is kind of the life where Joseph is at and where he's living at this point in his life 17 years old remember now and now Israel loved Joseph more than all of his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors what is what is what is what's going on here what is happening here we got we got a young 17-year-old who's bringing the the the the the evil report that his brothers have done who is the most favored the most loved the most most treasured person that his dad has and his Dad gives him this coat of many colors and it says and when his Brethren saw their father loved him more than all his Brethren they hated him and and they could not speak peaceably unto him now watch and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told his Brethren and they hated him yet the more I love this story God is moving and they are hating God is moving in the midst in their very presence and they're hating what's happening and he said unto them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for behold we were binding sheep in the field and lo my sheath arose and also stood upright and behold your sheath stood around about and made obsin to my sheath so what that word means when we look at that absence it means the movement of the body made in a token of respect or submission okay so he now he's having to bow down and and approach him as as an altar and he's acknowled in his superiority he's acknowledging and paying homage to Joseph is what these sheep are doing well that didn't go over too well and it says his brothers said unto him shalt thou indeed Reign Over us remember these are older brothers he's 17 the the second to the youngest of these 12 and Reuben is no telling how old he was at this time and so now you're going to tell us you're going to Reign Over Us ye shall indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his word so what what's going on here this is God's chosen hated hated hated hated and you wonder when you say you're God's chosen why you get the repercussions you get when you dress the way you dress you wonder why you get the repercussions you get when you pray the way you pray when you sing the way you sing you wonder why and he told to his father and his Brethren and he rebuked him and said what is this dream that thou Hast dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to the to the Earth and his Brethren watch now envied him and his father observed the saying and his Brethren went to feed their flock father's flock and Sheck them they envied him so we got hate we've got envy that leads to malice and strife destruction all in the house of God yeah these are the 12 tribes of Israel that's these are the guys we're talking about and Israel said unto Joseph do not thy Brethren feed the flock in shech them come and I will send thee unto them now there's no doubt in my mind that Israel had to known that this there could have been a problem with this this this this could be some bad blood Between Brothers here and he's sending him out to go out there and meet these guys but watch what Joseph said Joseph looks at this situation he says here I am here am I in other words Joseph here is saying I'm ready I know who I am I know what I am called for I know where I stand isn't ambition a wonderful thing let's pray Heavenly Father we just come before you tonight with grateful Hearts thankful for this opportunity just to come and speak the word and share the word and hear the word father and Lord knowing that as we speak we hear and as we speak we receive and Lord we just ask that you would speak to us mightily tonight that we may receive all you'd have in store for us we love you Lord and help us to grow through the ministry of the word tonight we love you with all of our hearts and pray for those who couldn't be here in Jesus name name amen amen you can have your seats so tonight I want to speak if I could for just a little bit a little thought and keeping the vision alive you know brother Ben spoke last week he spoke on the voice and so tonight we'll take a look at the vision and keeping the vision alive because down Through the Ages Christians have been called upon to overcome challenges Christians have been called to overcome challenge after Challenge and persecution and Through the Dark Ages and tri Tri after trial and to be honest if you're sitting here tonight and you claim to be a believer you will have challenges challenges with an S it don't end after one it don't end when you're saved it don't end after you're healed it begins to continue and continue and it rotates and the challenges come back around and come around so let me ask you tonight are you up to the challenge are we as Christians as Believers in the message of the hour and the hour we're living in are we up to the challenge and is the vision still alive you see I love the ambition that young Joseph has here in his life because he was able to recognize that the hour that he was living in and and that that the God had a purpose in his life and he God had this purpose in his life and that it was God's Gift in his life that was manifested in his life and that was the driving force behind his confidence you know as Believers I believe we ought to be confident we ought to be confident in the word we ought to be confident and versed in the Bible we ought to be confident and versed in the message we ought to be confident and and and reassured in the healing power of God Almighty confident knowing that God will provide and God makes a way Joseph was confident maybe Joseph was just a little downright arrogant before his brothers think about this no but he knew why could he be like that how could he be so confident and arrogant before his brothers because he knew that no matter what happened in his life it wouldn't change a single thing that God had revealed to him or that God had predestinated for him in his life you see brothers and sisters it was God who gave him that dream it was God who gave him the vision of who he was and what he was to do so Daddy couldn't change that Mama couldn't change that Brothers could hate him they could envy him they could they could try to kill him they could have Strife against him they could make his life miserable but that doesn't change one thing about what God told him he would be and what he would do that's the confidence and that confidence laid in the fact that God doesn't change his mind so if that was good for Joseph brothers and sisters God don't change his mind about us God doesn't change his mind about me either he doesn't change his mind if God called you he's not going to forget you why is it that people believe so many times they come to church they get they get a calling of God in their life and God calls them they give their their heart to the Lord and the next thing you know they turn and they go the wrong way and they're like Where's God now God don't forget you God don't save you to lose you God doesn't heal you so that the devil can take you so why do the Christians confess that well diabetes took him well you know cancer guy heart attack it took him that's not the way it works that's not the way it works cancer has never taken one single believer in the existence of mankind did you hear what I said cuz you didn't answer like you did I said cancer diabetes high blood pressure heart troubles it has not taken one single believer in the existence of mankind only God can give and take it's not the cancer it's not the devil only God can allow things to happen and God protects us the devil can't harm so let me tell you tonight and understand this tonight that the devil he may scratch and he may claw and he may dig and he may bite and he may he may try to to poke and he may fight and he may use threats and he may put fear and anxiety to try to scare you to death and have you shaken in your shoes but I challenge you tonight keep the vision keep the vision of who God says you are you are an overcomer tonight these are the words that's been given to the Believers that you are more than able to defeat Satan any time any place anywhere if you'll stand upon the word of God you're more than a conqueror through Christ you want to see the vision yeah you want just listen to what Revelations 1911 says and I saw is that a vision and I saw and I saw the heaven open and behold the White Horse and he that set up on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness doth judge he make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and his head were as many crowns and he had the name written that no man knew but himself and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God now where do where do you fit into this and the armies which were in heaven followed upon him upon white horses and clothed in fine linen and white a and clean and out of the mouth goeth a sharp sword and with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and the fierceness and the wrath of almighty God and he that on and and and he hath on his vesture and his thigh the name written king of kings and Lord of lords we're in the vision keep the vision alive brothers and sisters in this hour we're living in we have to believe that we are that vision and the prophet said it this way he said I hope if he calls here this morning the ministers get on fire we need ministers on fire preaching the word of God harder than they've ever preached why because we're in the end time we need Believers here Desiring to hear the word and feasting upon the word of God and saying God make me and mow me because the hour is late he says keep the vision he says the ministers look at the vision we're dying The World Is Gone the church is backslid God is trying to call a bride out so in this hour we're living in keep the vision of your salvation keep the vision of your healing keep the vision of your deliverance keep the vision of your joy and your peace and if you're in that numbered few that's called The Bride of Jesus Christ keep the vision of that Rapture keep the vision of that Rapture in your mind and in your heart don't ever let it waver see it and put yourself there believe it live it desire it it'll change the way you live if you keep that Vision pure you keep that vision of that Rapture and you put yourself in there and you see it this is not mental telepathy but it is making you have such a desire such a strong will and a desire to live for God that you think I don't want to miss it under no circumstances when the Rapture comes I'll be there when the role is caught up yonder I'll be there when they have that marriage supper I see myself at the marriage supper you know why because I've got an invitation ain't nobody getting in without an invitation but I've got an inv invitation this way this afternoon if we could only keep that in our mind he says and according to the word of God that in these last days he's going to have a church he's going to have a people and these are the things that he promised he's going to do them he said he would and we're living in that time we're here 1963 we're here this is 2025 brothers and sisters we're here he's trying to get us to be real prisoners now oh oh I don't know if we like that but he said he's trying to get us be real prisoners now lock in with him brothers and sisters it's not a time to be Shackled to the things of this world it's not a time to be Shackled to the lust of the flesh it's not a time to be Shackled to all these things that are taking place fastpaced around us but it is a time to be a prisoner to the love of Jesus Christ and know that Jesus loves you and you're a prisoner of the word of God we look here at this Vision Joseph had of himself I'm going to try to slow it down a little bit and you stay with me we're going to look at Joseph here at the vision he had of himself and what did Joseph see in the morning when he woke up and looked into a mirror what kind of person did Joseph see now let's change the way we say that what kind of person do you see when you wake up in the morning and look into the mirror oh that's quiet did Joseph just see an insignificant Shepherd boy do you just see an insignificant churchgoer did Joseph look into the mirror and say I'm just going to go out here and take care of the sheep today or did he look into the mirror and think of himself as a leader that God would use to save the entire world from famine that's a vision that's a vision when he got up and he looked into the mirror so when you look into the mirror you say God use me to be a witness God use me to be a voice God use me to be an example God use me to help the world make [Music] it Joseph 17 years old now shepherding with his 11 brothers and brothers and sisters this story starts right out of the gate with this 17-year-old boy telling a telling something that his older brothers had done out in the field so here's Joseph a little snitch a little ttle tail a little tattletail and he's just a little sport brat let's just get down to the bottom of it if your name's Joseph I'm sorry we love brother Joe he's always told me he thought of himself in this story ever since I can remember he said I think of myself in this story but here is Joseph and right from the start his brothers they hate him they hate him and what makes it worse is is Israel his father shows favoritism to Joseph he likes Joseph the best you said wouldn't I like to be in Joseph she well let me tell you tonight the enemy made the despise you the enemy may may try to hold you down he may try to get you to fall he may get you off course he may get you off track and distract you from what God called you to do but I say tonight with the authority of God Almighty in my life devil in my life devil my heavenly father likes me the best you ought to be able to look in and tell the devil tonight listen devil my heavenly father likes me the best say it with me devil my heavenly father likes me the best father the best with some Authority he loves me he keeps me he favors me he clothes me he protects me he puts a roof over my head he feeds me he watches my children so little bride when all the the world despises when the world despises and rejects God moving in your life keep your vision because my heavenly father likes me the best Joseph's brothers here they despise him and you know what the funny thing about this story is is they despise him not because he done anything wrong but because he did everything right did you ever think about that the more you do right the more you do good the more people dislike you we'll get into why they despised him because of the good things his father had done for him you know as fathers those of you who are you do good things for your children you just do are sometimes your children despised for the good things you do for them yeah my heavenly father does a lot of good things for me am I despised sometimes because of them yeah Jacob had brought and this expensive coat he brings this coat for Joseph to wear around colorful meaningful this coat brothers and sisters it just screamed favorite son yeah nobody else got one did they Reuben no nope Simeon Levi Judah nope nope nope Dan nope isachar nope Gad Asher isachar nope nope Zebulon nope not even Benjamin that's the baby of the family family but just Joseph and Joseph gets his coat and he's so envied by his older brothers they saw this special coat and they knew by him wearing this special coat that had been draped over him that it it's going to mean he's going to assume the leadership and the authority in the family now I can just imagine I can this is my imagination take it for what it is is I can just imagine a 17-year-old arrogant boy and I can just imagine him maybe bringing some of these troubles upon himself yeah maybe he paraded around a little bit in front of his brothers yeah look what I got believe about go to dinner tonight look what I got hey hey there Reuben we think about these threads you wish you had it don't you yeah parading man strutting his stuff look what I got you don't have one of these styling and profiling rubbing it in just a little bit this dude was worse than Travis Kelce coming in the 1970 suit to the Super Bowl some of you saw it he thought he was the stuff boy did he go home upset but he's got this coat now and Joseph is kids despised by his brother favored by his dad started having dreams now how many of you's ever had a dream raise your hand come on hands all over the building we've all had a dream but you know what sometimes dreams are best left unsaid or Untold this may have been a good situation because Joseph then goes to his brothers and he begins to tell this dream let me tell you Brothers what's going to happen I you're going to come before me and you're going to bow down I'm going to stand in the center and you're going to bow down before me and you're going to serve me you're going to reverence me you and Dad the Sun the moon the stars all of you are going to reverence me and his brothers hated him not because of the dream but because he told him the dream can you imagine how this goes he's out there telling them out there in the field how what's what's about to happen can you imagine the fury that must have been bowling in these grown men's Minds as this boy is telling them you're going to serve me Brothers yeah you're going to serve you're going to bow down before me wonder how many times they thumped him on the back of the head trying to get his attention so they couldn't stand him because he's doing everything right they couldn't take no more of coat boy telling them what that he's going to rule over him and he's getting all this special treatment from his daddy well well well jealousy now that's a terrible thing jealousy is a terrible thing listen to what the prophet said about this situation he said Joseph separated from his Brethren Without a Cause what was the matter with them he said Joseph wasn't willing to be separated it wasn't his will to separate but they separated him themselves from him this bright shiny dollar he's comparing Joseph to a silver dollar this bright shiny silver dollar and their penni's worth couldn't stand him we're talking about the children of Israel and their pennies worth couldn't stand him he says they know who they was they know they were Patriarchs they know that Jacob was their father they know that to be true but when Joseph was born he couldn't help it because he was spiritual he couldn't help it that he saw Visions he couldn't help it that he interpreted dreams and they were perfectly right and his patriarch Brothers moved with envy and sold him to the Egyptians they separated themselves from him because they were pennies we throw pennies away think about this they were pennies he was of a different quality oh come on bride he was of a different quality so is the real believer today they're of a different quality they'll separate themselves come on they'll separate themselves they don't understand it Copper from Silver but we find out they moved with envy and sold him why they do the same thing today because of jealousy they didn't want to break down because it was the quality that was in them not the quality that was in him and because of it they were jealous because they were pennies and he was a dollar jealousy how bad is jealousy when it gets to moving through the church that's why you have to keep such a such a tight tight grip and not allow jealousy to move amongst the people and not let jealousy move in your own Hearts they're so fed up with Joseph jealousy envy that they were they plan to kill him Reuben the half brother begins to plead with the rest of the brothers spare his life we don't want his blood on our hands and they're sitting there having this conversation and Israel then sends Joseph out to the field where these brothers are conspiring to kill him and then he gets to walking out there and here they saywell look who's coming here comes the dreamer how many's ever heard that look who's coming here comes the Christian here comes the believer here comes the Holy Rollers all he does is sing songs all he does is quote scripture all he does is talk about a message here comes the dreamer and when they seen the opportunity They seized it and they grabbed a hold of Joseph and they stripped off the coat off of him the coat of multicolors the coat that they hated and envied so much and they threw him down into a pit so deep that you couldn't even see the daylight at the top of it and now Joseph is down in the pit these people mean business all want to kill him but one and in their mind they're saying nobody will bow to you now dreamer but let me ask you I don't know about you but if about right about this time if I was in his shoes I might would be having just a little bit of Doubt creep into my mind about that dream I had are you with me you see sometimes we go through struggles and we go through hardships and we go through hard times and we find ourselves in the pit of despair in the pit of distress destruction and the world is closing in to where you can't even see daylight that's when you got to keep the vision the prophet said the whole time he was in the pit what did he say he said I could still see the vision of who I am and that these people are going to bow down to me so we can't allow doubt to come into our mind as they begin to look and they they take and they rip this coat and with hatred they put the the the Lamb's blood or the goat's blood upon it and take it back to his father and deliver it to his father and and they tell a lie you see how one thing leads to another and another and another Envy jealousy hatred Strife lies deceit destruction and they take it back and they say father we heard an animal and we heard Joseph crying in the wilderness and before we can get there that he was already gone and this is all that's left he's dead all the while Joseph sold into slavery listen to what Genesis 39 says Joseph was brought down into Egypt and potier an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard the Egyptian bought him out of the hands of the Israelites the midianites same thing and he had brought him down thither and the Lord was with Joseph let me say that again and the Lord was with Joseph envied hated because of what the Lord was doing but now here he is being delivered and the Lord was with him and he was a prosperous Man In The House of the master of the Egyptians and the master saw watch this the master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand you mean to tell me his brothers look at what God was doing in his life and they hated him and now we've got a a master an owner of the slave Joseph Piper and he looks at him and he says look at what God's doing in your life all you touch prospers what's wrong with people around the church I'm going to get myself in trouble and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer of his house and he all that he had he put into his hand and it came to pass from that time that he made him an Overseer in the house and over all that he had and the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake yeah what would have happened if they would just kept him around their own house but no they wasn't happy with that they didn't like the way God's program was playing out they wanted to do it their way create their own pattern their own way of success but now here's Piper an old Egyptian who is re reaping the benefits of God through Joseph in his own house and he left all that he had into the hands of Joseph and he knew and he knew and he knew not all he had and he saved the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored you see you didn't get much higher than Piper Piper was right he was like the right hand at that time he was the one building up the military he was the protector of the Pharaoh and now Joseph is setting here God guiding his life what is God doing God's training him God trains us the things we go through is our boot camp it's our training it's God getting us ready to be able to believe and to be able to grasp what's going to happen in the end times and now here is Joseph he's learning how to speak Egyptian he's learning the customs of the Egyptians he's learning the hieroglyphics he's learning how to write in Egyptian so now he's bilingual you know this all comes into play at the end when his brothers come and they try to conspire again a little story and they think he can't understand them he hears every word they say and so here he is he's being trained and and pfer looks at this situation and pfer looks at this and says this is not ordinary Prosperity brothers and sisters the Bride of Jesus Christ prospers different than other people prosper and if you're not experiencing that open your eyes the bride is taken care of and here now Joseph here potterer look at this he says there is something out of the ordinary with the way this guy operates there is something greater that is driving him there is something greater that motivates him and there's something greater that pushes him to do what he's doing and brothers and sisters I want it to be set of me I want it to be said of you that when my feet Hit the Floor there's something different that motivates that guy there's something that different that pushes that guy he don't act like everybody else you don't act like everybody else can you imagine what it would be like if everybody said that that that group over there is never negative you ever had a negative day sir yeah sometimes it like to be a fly on the wall what if that group was never negative what what if that group of people over there didn't have nothing but encouraging words to say what if that group over there always had nothing but a but a but a a a Christian song on their tongue I seen I seen on the I don't know where I've seen it but I've seen where somebody put this illustration out and saidwhat if we spend as much time reading our Bibles as we do looking at Facebook man that struck a Accord with me because I I don't I'm guilty I just tell you I I'm guilty I can get consumed I'm making a confession to you I can get consumed sitting there looking at that thing because one thing leads to another and then once they see what you're searching and what you're researching everything they show is exactly what you're looking for man I've learned 50 million diets this week fasting water vinegar lemon well some of you Angels need to let me know y'all look at Facebook too but he doesn't act like everybody else in Jo and Piper looks at this and he he looks and notices Joseph and he puts him in charge of everything now I want you to notice that look looking at this Joseph has been up he's been down he's been up he's been down he's up again praise the Lord God is good life is good I'm prospering look at Piper he loves me and then it came to pass his master's Wife cast her eyes on him well oh devil what does she say lie with me Temptation Temptation begins to set in man we're hitting it all tonight hate Envy jealousy temptation all of this is happening in the life of Joseph and it happens in the lives of all believers it's a cycle that we have to go through we we're down we're up I'm not saying we're we're bipolar but I'm saying we go through ups and downs and mountains and valleys but I want to live on the mountain more than I do in the valley and as one preacher said I don't want to live on the mount uh just good enough I want to live on the mount more than enough and so here he is this is constantly going up and down and she says lie with me after all he's gone through you think he's finally arrived and things are going to balance out in his life but here comes more trouble trouble is coming around and Joseph this well-built handsome dark complected young man has caught the eyes of Piper's wife and now Piper's wife saysi want it all I want all that God's done for you all the blessings I'm going to steal it all of your joy I'm going to take it your your prosperous life I'm going to destroy you know that's what the devil does kill steal and destroy and so here she is she's looked at this and and she's looked at this and she says now I want you to lie with me go to bed with me and Joseph tells her no no no now watch what Joseph says he says I can't do this to the master who owns the house such respect at this time but more importantly what he says next is what gets me he says I can't sin like this against God in the hour of probably his greatest Temptation Piper's wife was no doubt a beautiful woman most Egyptian women were they had all the beauty secrets all the the lotions the creams the saves and they were well doctored you might say well manicured and now she has throwed herself at him and he's in this time of Temptation and he says I can't do this to my God what do we do when we're faced with temptation we have to have the attitude that Joseph did and say I can't do this to my God I love him too much you see Joseph wasn't worried about the popular part of the world he wasn't worried about what the world thought he wasn't worried about about his what his friends would say Oh you mean you turned her down she's beautiful he didn't care he didn't care what everybody else thought he only cared about what his God thought you see brothers and sisters his only concern was pleasing God if we lived every day with our only concern God how can I please you today God how can I please you today what can I do to make to make to make you uh uh first in my life because you know that's what matters he wanted to keep God first no matter what and when I looked up at the brother brandom says it this way he says brothers and sisters if you'll put God first in everything you do you're bound to come out all right put God first Seek You first the kingdom of God have you ever witnessed that to be the truth put God first he keeps on pay your tie first people think why you preach on ties I don't get none of it I mean I don't I it don't come to me so I can preach on it sometimes it's hard for pastors to preach on it but it ain't hard for me to preach on it why do you preach on ties because it ain't your money anyway we made it through rough times because my wife paid ties I tell you that's the truth When We Were Young getting started I thought man I ain't giving no more money I got to have this money she said no we pay our ties I said but we can't afford to pay ties' she said you can't afford not to pay TI I I told my boys I try to teach them pay your ties first I said because here's what happens I said let me tell you from experience this is what happens now let this be a lesson to you young people okay if you start making money pay you ties if you make $10 pay a dollar okay make a 100 pay 10 you see how that works you pay it first because you say well well I need all of my paycheck this week cuz I know how it is when you're young and you get these little paychecks coming in you get $150 man you worked hard all week 150 bucks 150 bucks you need that $150 don't you you like to have $150 sure you would but what happens is you say well I need it this week and I need next week because I need to go buy my my sweetheart a a birthday present I I'll catch up on my ties later boy are you setting yourself up for some heartache and I'm not talking about that little boy pay your ties first because you you take and you take and you take and next thing you know you owe $5 $600 in ties and then you realize how in the world am I ever going to get5 or $600 of tithing you make a dollar pay 10 cents you make 10,000 you pay a th000 100,000 10,000 you see how that works y'all done got me off my script keep God first pay your ties first pay everything pay first PR pay God pay first pray first at the morning pray all through the day give God the first place in everything you'll be a witness how many can testify and say that's the truth I'm a witness that's the truth I'm G to have to find a place like brother juwel said to parachute out this helicopter I'm halfway through y'all this this y'all just pulling it you're pulling it out so one day he walks into this house and she grabs the coat and demands him come to bed with me and he turns and run and she's left holding what the coat what's up with this guy in his coats can he stay in his clothes one time he loses a c he's in a pit next time he loses a c he's in her fantasies I'd rather be in the pit this man needs to learn to keep his coat on life is coming at him hard he's on the run and he begins to he leaves his coat behind and pfer hears this and she cries out she cries out and says listen this little slave boy of yours he tried to come in and and take me to bed he tried to seduce me into sleeping with him and I've got his coat to prove it and Piper hears this and he throws Joseph where you know I I I really have a respect for Piper because if somebody mistreats my wife they're probably not going to prison they're probably going to the Grave let's just be honest if you're trying to pull on y'all's wife what she said he tried to pull but I have a respect for potier because apparently potier knowed what kind of woman he was married to you let that sink in if she was a trusty woman if she was a faithful wife if she was somebody that could be trusted he would have done away with Joseph immediately but he knew what she was what he was married to and he knew what kind of loyalty Joseph had and so he had no choice he had to do something so he he puts him back into the prison now we would look at this and we might say this ain't fair this is not fair let me tell you life is not fair sometimes God delivers us out of hard situ situations and sometimes God takes us through hard situations but either way we get to the other side Joseph will be blessed for obeying God you think well he shouldn't be punished but he will be blessed in the hard times is when we grow it's in The Valleys when we grow it's under stress that when we get stronger you know muscles muscles don't get bigger muscles don't get harder if you don't put them under stress you say man I wish I look like uh what's his name Coleman what's Ron Coleman and you very lifting that Fort that's only lifting you doing I just seen a clip where Ron Coleman dead uh squatted 800 lbs three times that's why his legs look like this one of them why is because he puts his body under stress and he puts his body under the pressure and he begins to grow and so when we are growing we're under pressure we're under stress but God sees us through in those times and here is Joseph Joseph is in this prison for something he didn't do but what's he do he keeps the vision he's keeping his vision all the while all the time and he remembers what God is showing him he wasn't down there crying well this ain't fair I gave my heart to God and look where I'm at now he wasn't down there crying he was just down there being a leader he was down there having the kind of faith that Believers have to have knowing that God will get you through anything brothers and sisters I've got so much more we're going to have to just find a spot here but brothers and sisters God never forgets us do you realize that we're not going to get to we're not going to get to his brothers coming we're not going to get to to what happened uh when they come in front of him we're not going to get to any of that we're not going to get to what happened with Jesus we're not going to get to to what happened with Paul we got so many illustrations that we can take this to but one thing I want you to know is God never forgets us no matter where we're at no matter what condition you're in think about this if you back slide God don't forget you you may turn your back you may walk out on God you may think you're never going to be back and you're never going to go to church and you'll never do nothing for God he hadn't forgot you when you fall he picks you back up you say what if I fall again he picks you right back up well I keep tripping I can't quit tripping I just trip over everything he just keeps picking you up do you see how the favor of a loving God is Joseph kept his perspective Joseph kept his vision Joseph knew that God delivered him once he could do it again misery is something we can't Harbor and I'm going to close with this thought misery is a state of suffering you know the old saying misery loves company why is that they want somebody to cry with them they want somebody to to lay on their shoulder they want somebody that feel the same suffering and the same discomfort that they're going through Joseph wasn't in that P in that prison he wasn't in that pit full of misery I could hear him down there in that prison I'm one of them who are you I'm one of them one of who I'm one of them I'm going through well you breaking out of here I'm I'm going through I'll pay the price yeah you're going to pay a price when they catch you you better not try to run let me tell you brother don't try to run I'm not running from nobody I'm going through with God because God sees me through the hard times when you're desperate for God things change in your life Joseph is more or less running the prison now in pifer's house these two high ranking officials are imprisoned you got the cup Bearer and the baker they both done something that Pharaoh evidently didn't like because now they find themselves down in the prison and they're down there in the prison and they're trying to figure out how are we going to get out of this situation how are we going to get out of this what's going to change and so they go to sleep one night and they have a dream and lo and behold who's there let me tell you boys this is what I was born for come over here tell me all about it and they begin to tell the dream to Joseph and Joseph begins to to listen to the dream and and he begins to go back there and and he tells the he tells the cup Bearer your dream means in three days you're going to be restored back to your position with pharaoh and Joseph asked when you get your job back will you remember me yeah yeah I got you I got you bro I remember you put in I put in a good word for you well the baker he liked this situation pretty good sounds pretty good old cup bear is getting restored to Butler he's going to be right back in there with Phar rose right hand tell me Joseph what my dream means well yours don't mean quite the same thing three days you going to be hanged and the birds are going to Peck the flesh off of your skin off of your bones and sure enough Watch What Happens three days it's all comes to pass three days later big celebration you know what the celebration was without looking come on somebody Pharaoh's birthday happy birthday pharaoh and they're having this big party and here is is the is the is the cup Bearer and here is the is the is the butler or the Baker and they come there and he brings the the cup to to pharaoh and he's looking at pharaoh and he's so happy to be back where he's at and he's got all the opportunity in the world to tell Pharaoh hey do you know how I knew I would be back here and he looks at pharaoh and hands him the cup and he forget Joseph no doubt Joseph was listening from the prison happy birthday Pharaoh oh thank God I'm going to get out of here I'm going to get out thank God this trial is over and he forgot Joseph two more years two more years God leaves him notice I said God leaves him in the prison but God has a way of bringing things around Pharaoh has a dream I don't know what the answer is to my dream I need help somebody please somebody with wisdom somebody who can interpret dreams can somebody please help me and that cut by cut bear says you know what I remember a guy there's a Hebrew fell he was down there in the prison with me his name was was was Jim Jo Joe Joseph if you Pharaoh if you will bring Joseph up here if you'll bring him up here he will listen to your dreams and he can tell you exactly what they mean he was perfect he knew I was going to be restored he knew you were going to hang the butler he knew all these things as soon as we told him so sometimes it may look like that God has forgotten you you know there's a song says I don't even know if you know my name can you imagine Joseph may have sat down there in that prison and say Lord I don't even know if you know my name have you ever been there God don't forget he brings him right back around into the very presence of pharaoh and Pharaoh tells him the dream and Joseph said your dream means this let's stand we'll close right there Prophet said in his prison he constantly remembered he was born for a purpose it may seem Grim it may seem dark it may seem like you're never going to get to the place that you want to be I've been working for 30s something years to try to get to the place I want to be some of you probably been working longer than that just keep working just keep trying just keep pushing just keep doing but he said in this in this prison he constantly remembered he was born for a purpose he was born for a purpose and he was going to sit by a king although the rest of them was going to Bow a knee to him his vision told him so but before his vision could completely be fulfilled he had to become a prisoner and he had to become a ruler and he had to come from the prison house and he had to become a prisoner of the word of God that he could only say what God put in his mouth then God moved through him how many would say God I want to become a prisoner of your word I want to become a prisoner of your love I want to become a prisoner of your passion and what you would have in store for us Heavenly Father you see the hands raised amongst the building the night Lord Lord Lord I know this this message is typically not what we would do on a Wednesday night but
