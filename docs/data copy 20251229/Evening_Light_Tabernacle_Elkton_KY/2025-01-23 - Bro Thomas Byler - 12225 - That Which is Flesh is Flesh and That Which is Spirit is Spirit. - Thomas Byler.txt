the the touch you've already given her Lord go with us now father and you've all heard all the other requests but we lift them once Up Before You Lord and ask God that you'll CH us do it and we love you in Jesus name amen amen turn your bibles if you will amen the book of St John St John 3 St John 3:1 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus aned and said unto him verily verily I say unto you except a man that be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answer us answered verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit amen Marvel not that I said unto ye the unto thee ye must be born again and do you have the title up there for us amen if not yeah and that which is my title is going to be that which is flesh and that which is spirit I meant to put on there that which is flesh is flesh and that which is spirit is spirit amen so that's our title tonight amen God bless the reading of the word you can be seated amen and I just want to read a couple more and then uh to try to lay a foundation ation if we could amen but him brother Jesus here talking to Nicodemus Nicodemus coming to him by night and you know confessing that nobody could do these things unless he came of God and Jesus begin to tell him you know that about the New Birth amen the first great commandment amen and then that is that you've got to be born again and he kind of explains it and I love the explanation and and I don't think I've ever preached on this before not and at least not with this title amen uh but I like what he's saying and he's making a point and the point is of course that you got to be born again of water and of spirit and then he just makes that blunt statement that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit amen Amen in St John 6 and verse uh 62 St John 6 just a few pages over it says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profites nothing wow that right so Jesus said the pro the the flesh don't profit anything amen we'll cover that here in a minute it is the spirit that quickeneth amen the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life how many knows what our greatest enemy is the flesh it's your greatest enemy not even the devil is as great as your flesh when it comes to your enemy it's your greatest enemy amen all right let me give you the scripture for it I wasn't going to I was going to skip this but I feel that strangely just to go this way in Galatians 5 and verse 16 this is just to make uh to uh vindicate what I just said about the flesh is profiteth nothing so what what are the works of the flesh Galatians 5 and verse 19 it says now the works of the the flesh are manifest which are these love joy peace longsuffering no adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft all that witchcraft that's all one of the manifestations of the flesh this is what the flesh will do wrath witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murder let your flesh rule one time and it can lead to murder that's right let somebody do just the wrong thing at the right time lose your temper like Cain did is that right he started out with Envy he started out with jealousy it turned into hatred and then it turned into murder that's where the flesh goes that's why Jesus said there ain't much good about your flesh it was born in sin shaping in iniquity come into this world speaking lies ain't that right that's why you got to have a new birth because that first one ain't no good ain't nothing good about our first birth why do you think he said you've got to be born again and born of what born of spirit born of the Holy Spirit we know we are Triune being we're outside is flesh then we have a spirit that you at your birth you pull in suck in a spirit is that right amen you become a living Soul on the inside of that is your soul that's a very being your very being is on the inside of the inside amen so the spirit has a lot to do with it amen my it goes on envyings murderers drunkenness and reings is that what the world is all manifesting and such like of the which I tell you before as I have told you in times past that they which do such things shall not go to heaven they shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the spirit the fruit of the spirit is love amen the opposite of hatred praise the Lord why because that which is flesh is flesh and that which is spirit is Spirit if you're born into the flesh you're going to do what the flesh does until you are born again you will be catering to that flesh you'll never be able to get away from it it's your nature you can even think oh I'm going to you know somebody smack you or be mean to you oh I'm going to be mean I'm going to be nice back but guess what down on the ins side you don't really want to I'm just supposed to you do it because you're supposed to or or whatever you've been taught to all right praise the Lord let me go on but the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace longsuffering gentleness and goodness and Faith oh my well how much greater the spirit is meekness not Pride Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and Lust For if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit praise the Lord Romans 8 says there is therefore now no condemnation to the that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen how many believes that's what we need to be doing we invest so much time so much of our lives are spent around taking care of the flesh it's the truth but we ought to be spiritually strong we ought to make sure that there our spirit the holy spirit is taken care of how do we do that and I'll get into that because I want to talk to you a little bit about uh uh impersonations impersonators and the greatest stumbling block that uh is known to humanity I believe brother B said the biggest stumbling block is somebody that has a profession but not a possession they're impersonators or Hypocrites and they act like the Christians but guess what they can't never overcome the flesh they'll never overcome they'll never really be able to conquer that flesh they'll still have jealousy they'll still have Strife they'll still have fusses and arguments can't get along with nobody unsatisfied hello amen amen this thought came to me yesterday just thought on it a little bit and then last night I woke up by 12:00 and for some reason that thought came back and I begin to think this am man and I quickly got my phone shut Niagara falls off that's what I listen to All Night Long Niagara Falls I shut the Niagara Falls off and got on that memo and talked about you know the the the flesh is flesh and the spirit is Spirit and the Lord begin to pour it out amen and I said man if I go back to sleep tomorrow morning I'll say boy you should have written it down you done forgot what the Lord showed you because you didn't do it amen oh my let me read on okay the Bible says for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen listen so he says verse eight Paul says so that they that are in the flesh cannot please God in other words if you're taking care of your flesh you're living by your feelings and your emotions and all of that you cannot please God you won't please God but you are not in the flesh Paul says we are living in the flesh but you're not living according to the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is not of his you got to be born again well that's kind of simple I don't care how simple it is that's what God told me to preach tonight that's what we're preaching amen amen praise the Lord and if Christ been you is in you the body is dead because of sin because but the spirit of life because is life because of righteousness and here's that famous scripture but if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also make alive your mortal body in other words it's going to have a little effect on this flesh it's going to cause you to come alive cuz I don't know about you but I don't like to be dead I don't like to be stagnant I like to be alive how many likes to be alive most people are zombies walking around unhappy no Holy Spirit no you know just satisfying the flesh it's all they live for and it brings forth death it's death but the spirit is life listen what Jesus said the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life how many believes that that's why the prophet of God said you know the Holy Spirit only feeds on one thing the Holy Spirit feeds on one thing and that is the word of God it don't feed on Hollywood it don't feed on the trash it don't feed on the ACC caring of the world it don't feed on ifs maybe sir I think so or my ideas no it's got to be thus day of the Lord that's what it feeds on Amen I was thinking well I thought well look look at this way back here in Peter let me see here yes first Peter way way way back I didn't put a tab in there so we're going to go have to go looking for it 1 Peter 1 and verse 23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of God how many believe that that second birth is a birth that's birthed by the word by the word of God you've been born again because you believe the word of God you accept the word of God and when you do that you become born by the word you have a word birth now a god birth you become Sons and Daughters of God by the spirit that dwells in you if anybody don't have the spirit of God he none of his but if you do have the spirit of God in your heart and in your life and in your soul you're become a son and daughter of God you've been born born again amen by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of man is as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever how many believe you've been BN by the word of God that endures forever Jesus said I come to give you eternal life that inside man he's an eternal being he's not temporary wo he don't get gray hair he don't get wrinkles he don't get feeble he don't get arthritis he don't get diabetes he don't get high blood pressure he don't get old he's stays young he liveth and abideth forever that soul that inside man that new man the outside May perish but the inart man is renewed day by day amen that which is flesh is flesh amen all right let me hurry up might as well say it all right let's go back a little bit cuz I want to pick up this appetite of the believer is that right talk a little bit about appetite and thirst amen but first we want to compare and talk about amen talk about that which is flesh is flesh and that which is uh uh uh spirit is spirit and man you go all the way back to Cain he was a carnal believer is that right he worshiped ship God he went to church but he worshiped God just according to what he thought he worshiped God his way what he thought was right he was a natural believer a fleshly Believer and he hated Abel why because Abel was a spiritual believer and Abel had a revelation that it wasn't no apple he realized it had to do with blood it was Eve and Adam that sinned they were blood isin't that right and something had to pay for their sin something that's living and had to be a sheep at that time he had a revelation and Abel the Bible says that he offered to God a sacrifice am me he took a lamb grabbed the lamb out of his herd come up to a rock somewhere took a stone and begin to hacking at his throat hacking at his throat hacking and hacking brutal blood splattering all over him and everything else he looked up bloody M he says that's what I'm looking for that's what it's going to take to cover blood without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins something's going to have to die to pay the price because he knew Jesus the lamb was going to come and that he was going to shed his blood and he was going to have blood all over him blood everywhere but he was going to pay for sin he had the Revelation he had it by spiritual Revelation can I say something very quietly just your carnal worship isn't what God is looking for they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen you have to worship Him by spiritual Revelation when God spiritually reveals himself to you and gives you of his Spirit then you're ready to worship Him the world is full of carnal worshippers a't that right the Pharisees worshiped they Sayang that it all of that is in vain do you worship me why because you're teaching the doctrines of man you don't come my way so I'm not accepting it he didn't accept Cain's worship and because of that Cain hated him Cain hated Abel brother bam says the carinal believer will always persecute the spiritual believer the carnal believer hates the spiritual believer amen try any way to put him to death get rid of him jealous of him amen you can have somebody sitting in the pews and and they're backslid they got Moss all over them somebody's horn is blowing and then there's another one oh praise be to God hallelujah preach it brother and the other look over like what who do they think they are huh they think they're so spiritual huh that's a natural man perhaps jealous or envious of a spiritual person amen all right was it the same way with the Pharisees what were they oh they looked like believers they acted like Believers a that right they worship like it but Jesus say you Hypocrites you do all these things they had pride in their hearts Ain that right they were jealous of Jesus when the Great crowds followed him they wanted to get rid of him many times they tried to kill him they had murder in their hearts even in the end away with him away with him crucify him a man that raised the BL the dead up and everything else why that which is flesh is flesh and that which is spirit is Spirit woo M we don't want that which is flesh we want that which is spirit amen think about all down through there Pharisees especially they were proud out didn't want at the uppermost seats they still had all of the works of the flesh Pride jealousy hatred murder can't get away with it can't get away from it the only way to get away from it is to get a new birth let the Holy Spirit rule your life amen all right I didn't finish Romans let me RA finish it is that okay if it dwells in your body your mortal body it will also Quicken your Mor mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh but to live after uh for if if ye live after the flesh ye shall die pretty plain ain't got to do a lot of preaching on that but if you through the spirit do cleanse the Deeds of the flesh you shall live how many knows that you get enough of the Holy Ghost you can't overcome them things by yourself you need more of the Holy Ghost that's why we say greater is he that is in the flesh in you than you the flesh that's in the world how many glad that the greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Amen for as many as Le are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God see the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen praise the Lord let's go for a few minutes back to the Old Testament David he had a revelation he was a spiritual man that right he was a spiritual man God had helped him and work through him to kill a lion and a bear and when he seen that Philistine that Goliath the carnal man Little rdy David we all understand the prophet painted him as a skinny little um shrimp you know sometimes people are just extra small and extra skinny you know Micah was that way when he was growing up he's not that way anymore but he's a little shrimp I wouldn't want to call him a shrimp now man but anyway that's kind of like what David was just a shrimp and there was Goliath huh Hercules huge Mammoth bulging muscles great big thick neck no doubt huge humongous with a great big sword 14inch fingers huh come on out here huh that was the natural man making his boast is that right come out there and he made his boast to David but David had a revelation in his heart he was full of faith in God he took his five smooth stones and said you come with me you come with you me with your carnality amen how many know even God said amen go ye and uh uh uh preach the gospel he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe they'll lay hands on the sick and they recover amen they'll cast out Devils if anything bites them if serpent or whatever bites them and the then they thing it shall not harm them all those carnal things the spiritual man is called to knock him down just as Goliath the natural man he was flesh that which is flesh is flesh and to challenge something that's spirit amen what's going to win the spirit's going to win the spirit's going to win just like David and Goliath he probably didn't look like much down there I wonder how far away he was I wonder how far away he was but no doubt if a lot of them maybe couldn't see him maybe they were down too low or something but that little guy when things went to slinging hello that big guy come up and was ready when he let go of that sling folks everything Stood Still just hello I can just about see it the old J froze kind of like when somebody gets knocked out it just freeze and then slowly but surely boom David went little guy that little went over there grabbed his SW and started swing grabbed his head and said yeah I don't know but I sure would I'd give that a little Victory scream amen that's kind of what you and I need when you've are conquered amen you've con all kinds of bad things in your life and you've got the joy of the Lord in your heart you can say yeah I've got joy unspeakable and full of Glory we don't want to go and chain can's church he don't like Kane's Church man I'll tell you what they were so cold and formal so carnal there wasn't an amen in the church amen whenever maybe uh let's just say Abel went to visit him one time and he went up there and preached a FL of the word of God there wasn't much there but he said amen Maybe their Church turn around who's that back there talking who's back there amening amen all cold and starchy brother talked about the denominational churches amen amen that uh how that you know nowadays a woman being a type of the church how that she doesn't want to have any children Ain that right neither do these denominations want any of these real Born Again children crying hooping tongue speaking hollering worshiping they don't want none of them around them why they're too cold and too formal they don't want it's like to say [Applause] Heen Glory but a Son of God that which is born of the spirit I don't know about you but I don't like to go into a church amen where icicles are hanging off the chandeliers I don't like to go with there's no amens there's no Hallelujah there's no worship let me just go into my other phase talk about you know if you're born of the spirit amen you feed on the things of the spirit how do I get more of the spirit how can I have more of the spirit brother berer amen not take so much time like brother B was preaching anden a certain time I'm cutting that off and we going to listen to table we're going to pray now take so much time on everything else and start feeding your soul amen start feeding the white dog start feeding the Holy Ghost In You am appetite if you know who you are want to know what you are check your appetite think about what you've got to have amen you got to have some food I think I this come to me last night mean you got to eat something brother B says if you neglect to Milk The Cow you'll go dry if you neglect to turn a corner amen you're going to reck and if you neglect the feed the Holy Ghost you will die and there's something about it I could we could probably all smack our belly a little say I ain't dying I'm doing pretty good huh when it comes to our flesh we take care of it whenever we get a little hungry it's time to cook something cook me something I've got to have something to eat if we get real hungry man I got to have something to eat the same way you're thirst man when you get real thirsty man I don't care what I'm doing on my job I'm quitting I'm getting me a drink right now it can wait let me get a drink that's the way it ought to be with spiritually amen when you begin to get hungry amen you begin to drift away from God say I can't stand it I've got to have fresh water I've got to have another little more meal I got to have some more nothing great for God nothing greater for God to speak to you give you fresh Revelation that's the problem with people God ain't spoke to me he ain't spoke to me in a coon's age when's the last time the God spoke to you and whispered something to you amen amen makes a big difference but you got to have it you've got to have something good you don't want this drink that's comes from a broken sistern man-made Creeds and dog you don't want well brother B thinks the Bible means this here about it and that and the other it better say what it better line up with the word is that right you don't want to Creed you would want a broke drink from a broken sister if you're born again I remember when I was young we had a sister I opened that sistern lid and looked in and there was these little what did he call them little little worms that go like that just you know jumping around in there we eat we drink that I didn't know that where's the crack at they got in somewhere huh that's the way it is when people say well this Bible doesn't that Bible don't care how you dress or what you do do that's a crack it's God does care soon as you get one crack in and then wiggle Tails comes in it's like a pond amen that if it doesn't flow and have a nice fresh flow amen all kinds of moss gets in there then you get lizards and you get frogs and you get oh man everything that looks back you got wiggle tails and everything else that's filthy ain't that right that comes in there but kind of like our lives do sometime when you get away from God Amen every Everything become stagnated you walk with God become stagnated I don't feel that enthusiasm anymore I don't have that Joy anymore I don't have that peace anymore I don't have to jump anymore I don't have to Y anymore and if you're a child of God you can't stand it if the devil happens to trip you up and cause you to sin you can't stay there you can't stay there cuz you're a miserable person as the Propet said a backl person is the most miserable person because you know what it's like to have that real freedom and that enjoyment and that joy of the Lord when you get away from that I got to get back I got to get back amen if you're a real believer if you're of the spirit that which is spirit is spirit and if you're of the spirit brother bam says man I got to eat as the church doors are open I can't wait to get there I can't wait to push play you can't wait to pray amen why it's your nature if you get stagnated in your life you won't be happy and you won't be happy until you get back to where you ought to be get that spring flowing amen get that stream flowing once again praise the Lord Paul Shipwrecked ain't that right he had problems the carnal part of it was that they were amen a storm was coming and it was taking the ship and they thought they were all going to die a that right the angel said Paul tell everybody to stay on the ship if nobody gets off the ship nobody ja bails out everybody will be all right a that right and Paul told them and they obeyed and the all was okay that's kind of like us on the troubled Seas through our troubles and trials our natural trials and the carnality and so forth amen if you stay on the ship just hang on to God just hang on there God will take you through amen then he thought he got through ain't that right they were all having a weeny roast around the fire I hope they were good beef be hot dogs I love them but anyway and that's right now all of a sudden the Viper came out and bit Paul on the arm I believe it is big old deadly Mamba perhaps and they were all watching him thinking he was going to die watching him I've watched a cat die from a from a snake bite and boy it just goes slow and just to begin to can't hardly move paralyze manage just all kinds of terrible thing they were all watching Paul says hey Sam would you mind pass me another hot dog I want to roast it give me some of the marshmallows or maybe it was soup I don't know what it was you just get off of here huh what are you doing and they said in their minds when he was bit he said you know he escaped the sea but vengeance is coming after him and he's not going to escape here here a snakes bike it's going to get him amen praise the Lord but what happened maybe they didn't listen to Paul too much testifying this that or the other yeah we've heard it before we've heard it before but guess what after he shook that snake off and it didn't affect him their ears come unstopped and and when he said a word you know when he spoke they listened because they knew they thought they thought he's some kind of God after that well he's a amateur God but it was God in him that was greater than the carnal situation how many he's glad for that God in you is greater than your carnal situation and problem God doesn't keep you from carnal problems and situations from coming but he'll see you through if you are in him and he is in you amen praise the Lord whether it's sickness casting out Devils cancer doesn't matter what it is amen praise the Lord praise the Lord we're hungry hunger how many beli we need to hunger for the word more not just on Wednesday on Sunday but every day we should Hunger for More Of God I want more more amen woo I'm already my cup is already full brother Danny brother John my cup's already full but guess what I want it running over I want it pressed down good measure and running over there's more how many believes there's more of Jesus for you to be have there's more of the spirit for you to have so many people come to church and they sing songs and they do this that or the other and they go through the motions brother brand said he says but why don't they get in spirit first what you want to do is get in the spirit you want Revelations you want God you want you want joy you want all these things you have got to get into Spirit first because that's where you'll find it you won't find it in natural eating drinking or taking care of your natural body you won't get it there see that's why God said why Jesus said that which is flesh is flesh and that which is spirit is Spirit that's why you've got to be born again of the spirit of God praise the Lord and you do it by how how do we get more of the spirit praying I'm giving you a little time cuz I want you to think about how much time you spend in prayer talking to God how much do you really spend because how many knows it's awfully busy it's easy to go too long without praying and talking to God and then let me say this is important also it's important that you listen because he wants to talk back to you let me stop there a minute I believe that is just as important if not more so than prayer is to listen to what he wants to say to you what good does it do for me to just talk to you how you doing Mark doing pretty good yeah everything good right just talking to you and talk to you and and you never talk back wow I couldn't get a word in jwise but it's nice when somebody take some time and say Lord now speak something back lord speak back to me amen give him time to speak to you amen what do you think about the other way is what do you think about all the time amen that's part of one of the reasons I like preaching because that's one time when we get of course I do it pretty much I try to do it as much whether I'm working or wherever I am keep my mind stayed on him blessed is he whose mind is stayed on thee but sometimes you got to work this out or the other but sometimes it's very very good when you uh just perhaps take some time and just meditate on them you can do it laying on your bed just lay on your bed and and think about him is that right because when you think about the word of God when you think about how he justified you saved you how if you ever made it you already made it he thought of you before the found think start thinking on the things you know what the Bible said think on the things if there be anything good a good report honest good and all these things Philippians 48 somewhere in there he said think on the things CU what you think about is what empowers you it's what you're feeding on it's going in amen why do you think David said in Psalms he said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful amen don't want to be around in a bunch of negative people ah scoring this one and scoring that oh did you know this one did this and that one did that and don't even tell me about it if you want to talk to me about something tell me something good that somebody did or good things that's right I'll go ahead and say it I've had to shut my phone off on somebody like that sent me nothing but negative negative I said look you don't quit sending me this negative I'm shutting you off wouldn't quit it B I said I I ask you politely don't do it don't do it want to do somebody else fine no if you don't like it just don't read it no that's not good enough don't send it to me I said I know how to take care of the problem flip the switch hello and I'm a happy man because of it I'm happier because of it I don't need that that negativity is that okay amen all right well hopefully you ain't got to do that to nobody but anyway listen to this nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate D night how many believes we need to do more of that you want more God you want more of the spirit you want more of the effects of the holy spirit in your life think about what you meditate on I don't care get out there behind the barn driving down the road start meditating on God and see what happens see if it isn't like this he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his La Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly not so why because they don't meditate on the Lord all day and night they don't like to do what the God said do amen when God told Joshua wherever you go be of strong of good courage when you take the land nobody's going to be able to stand before you and all these things as I was with Moses so will I be with you but this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do all that is written therein and that thou shalt make thine and thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success amen give me a man give me a woman give me a housewife give me a farmer that'll put God first and everything and I'll show you persons who's successful despite all that the devil will pull it in front of them how many wants to be led by the spirit Lord help us we want to be led by the Holy Spirit tomorrow morning Lord what do you want me to do today Lord how do you want me to do this Lord lead me Lord guide me amen stand with me tonight musicians if you'll come um except for brother Joshua I'll I'll go ahead and just sing a song or two okay amen I really only got one song that I want to sing amen as they're coming let's bow our heads and how many in here would say I really want more of the spirit help me Lord to feed the Holy Ghost help me to feed that spirit because that which is spirit is spirit that which is flesh is flesh the fresh flesh profiteth nothing it really gets you nowhere it takes you backwards it's actually a minus in your life if it's not surrendered to God if it's surrendered to God then all of your feelings your emotions and all those things are fine because it's going to be controlled by the Holy Spirit God bless those hands all over the building we all desire a closer walk with you Lord Jesus tonight we ask God that you'll fill us in a greater way between now and Sunday that we will be a better Christian than what
