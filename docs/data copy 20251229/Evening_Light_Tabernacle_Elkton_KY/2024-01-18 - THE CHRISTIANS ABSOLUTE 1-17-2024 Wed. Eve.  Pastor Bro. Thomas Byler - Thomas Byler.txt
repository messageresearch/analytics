tonight I finally graduated to being a real preacher message preacher I'm just use my iPad tonight amen so amen we're gonna try that amen see how that goes for us amen amen maybe maybe I'll get away from that printer and all that paper and all that ink that I got to buy all the time ain't that right so maybe amen we could do it that way but I know one thing y'all have to do and that is learn to study on here amen and so I've still got some learning to do but praise the Lord amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight grateful Lord just once again to feel good to be healthy Lord Jesus and not only physically but spiritually to be healthy Lord and to feel like we've got our spiritual vitamins the way we're supposed to have them and Lord Jesus to feel alive and good and healthy Lord we do know father but a John and different one's not feeling the best yet Lord we just do ask God that you would just go to them Lord and Lord the chest congestion whatever it is Lord whatever sickness is on upon the people we rebuke it in the name of Jesus and believe God that by your stripes they are healed and father may they give you honor and glory and raise their hands and say thank you Lord I believe I am healed amen and when they get better testify of the healing power power of almighty God lord tonight we come into your house Lord and if there's any spiritually sick God we ask God that you would give him health and strength and healing for their Spirits Lord Jesus and for their souls Lord bless the meditation of our heart that which we feel you leave it upon our heart or to minister tonight bless all those that are streaming tonight we ask God you'd be with them in a special way may they be blessed also by father hearing not me but to hear your word and what you have to say to the church tonight God we ask in Jesus name amen turn your bibles if you will right into 1 Corinthians the 14th chapter First Corinthians 14 6 through 8 now Brethren I come if I come unto you speaking with tongu or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine and even things without Life Giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped for if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated now how many knows what message brother Brandon preached out of that one the uncertain sound that's right uncertain sound well that's not what we're preaching on the uncertain sound we're actually want to preach on the absolute amen the absolute I called it the Christians absolute this is back on kind of on our series amen the overview of a Christian the Christians absolute amen amen and I'm going to read another scripture um let me see over in Matthew I believe it is Matthew 6 16 and we'll begin with verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist and some Elias and others J Jeremiah so one of the prophets and he said unto them but who say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and and said Thou Art the Christ son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon bar Jonas for flesh and blood is not revealed it unto you but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against them amen so what a different tune in right one of them talks about an uncertain sound now nobody knowing just exactly what to do I mean and what do you do when you don't know what to do pretty much nothing you wait until you know what you're going to do you don't go presumptuously amen amen I was listening to uh I think the Bible yesterday and God had told him not to go up and fight against this certain uh enemy and so forth and but they presumed to go anyway and presumed and went after and I thought but that's right brother B preach a message on presuming don't go presuming you want to make sure of what you're doing amen so I thought I'd start out first of all if we're going to talk about absolute we want to talk about perhaps something that's uncertain or amen said it's something brother B called amen preaching on uncertain uncertain uncertainty amen amen and then we want to talk about that absolute brother bam says now we're living in a day of great uncertainty we all know [Applause] that amen there is great you talk about back in the 60s or 50s when he preached this in 1960 great uncertainty he said how manyan knows anytime anybody's outside of Christ it's always uncertain there's no certainty outside of Jesus Christ amen amen I've got a few out here this way amen we all know that the day of uncertainty time of uncertainty I don't believe that there ever was a time since the time first began back in the Garden of Eden When sin come in and broke eternity into time I do not believe there's ever been a space of time with so much uncertainty as today because there's not even one hope left in the natural world today now you say well I've seen times and reading history when the wars covered the earth that is true but never a time when the whole world could be blowed up or would be blowed up to people Jesus just second and such a destruction he says it it take weeks and hours and so forth now it just takes one minute maybe not that just a button press and she's all over Cuba can do it herself that little bitty Haiti could do it just any little nation that wants to can set the whole world completely on fire and blow her out of her orbit anytime they want to see it only takes one ftic well there's tens of millions and billions around the world to do that we shouldn't have a lot of Fanatics don't we watch some suicide case just reach up there and be to be among them and the devil so possess him just where this big these big hangers are hanging and just press that button and here they go amen get the wrong guy in there and as soon as that goes it's on the radar screens of other place places they press theirs and here we are that's all cuz they just got it every on his screen out they're watching out in the sea submarines you know how many times if you look at how many times that we almost was in a nuclear war and and sometimes it was a bear I think messing with the lines or whatever or uh or somebody sending something up and not telling nobody and just little little crazy stuff that almost mandate were so close they got right into the Red Zone and ready to push that button you know until so many times so close by accident why you laugh brother about I laugh because I know that ain't nobody going to get stupid until God allows it I many know ain't no fanatic going to touch it until God allows it that's the only thing that's keeping it amen and as long as you are here how you like that as long as you're here as long as God's people are here it's not going to happen amen but boy are we in a late hour amen a late hour could happen brother bam said back there just anytime on those radar screens they're watching it just looking for that thing to come and if it comes they're going to come back and so forth amen M cuz they just got it every felt got it scen out watching out in the sea the submarines out in the islands everywhere sitting around up in the north pole down in the South Pole everywhere with these big screen just let somebody press that button that's all they want and he their buttons pressed and the rest of them are pressed pressed and pressed what's going to happen think of that could happen before we go get out of service this morning amen but I like this and I copied these other two quotes cuz I like what he said afterwards but remember before that happens God has promised to come for his church how many he's glad for that he's coming for his church so don't we just don't know just what time would he will come but what a glorious thing it'll be for all those that love his appearing he will appear amen wouldn't you just love to see that this morning amen that's right that's what we're all looking for isn't it how many believes we look for that every every day brother John we're looking for him to come back to take us home in a Rapture amen what a hope what a hope for the believer the next one and then what does that want to make you do want to work now to get everyone in that position that they can that they can for that Rapture I've Recon I done everything that I know of how to do and I just W wish that I was a young fellow again 18 20 years old and know what I know how maybe I could stand up a little longer visitor this morning that's young you got a lot of Youth in you yet and maybe not family ties and things may God give you the Vision amen man I was thinking on the way to church you know I heard brother bam in one of those messages powerful message he says I'm not even worthy to be called your servant he says I'm I've just unprofitable FL I don't even feel worthy of being called his servant and I was like that's the prophet of God God with that kind of humility then I think Lord what have I done how that we have got we've got thus sayith the Lord we've got the message of Jesus Christ coming and we've got absolutely without question the truth how much do we do to try to share it to get it out there and I'm said Lord I certainly feel my just unprofitable servant like you know not what I should be Lord help me do we not all feel that way amen praise the Lord so we see that this is a certainly a world of instability amen uncertainty people that do not have an absolute or a tpost in their life [Applause] amen amen how many loves him tonight I'm amen it's so good just to be able to come in the house of God and open his word and to know that what you're reading is absolute truth like Jesus said so many times verily verily I say unto you [Music] TR truly absolutely absolutely I tell you amen how glad for an absolute as I was hearing a man speak or talk not long ago and he used the word absolute and I thought that's a very fine word perhaps he says I hear it used so many times absolutely and I looked up in the dictionary and Webster according to Webster it's perfect in itself it's Unlimited in its power primarily an ultimate an ultimate means that's all it's an absolute unlimited power amen the word absolute is perfect in itself he kind of repeats your amen and I thought that's a glorious thing that a Wonder wonderful word [Music] amen body should have an ultimate and every great achievement that's ever been achieved has to have an absolute behind it no matter what it is it's had an absolute behind it that's that's the final line back through this he says now listen it's an ultimate it meets an called an anchor amen the anchor absolute it's a fin tying post to every achievement amen and how the enemy in every way that he can will try to get you away from that app from that anchor that they in Egypt they got cornered there by the Red Sea mountains on one side Valley on the other Red Sea no escape nowhere no way to escape this way or that way Pharaoh's Army coming this what a place to stand see how the devil gets you in a place where you don't know what to do but remember if you're tied to that absolute that's got it Moses know that God promised them that he would take him into the land how many know that Moses was tied to an absolute amen praise the lord lord I laid that on my heart I said I think that's where it's coming out for amen tied to now how many so glad to be tied answer oh my what we know and and I thought about you know cuz we're we know that as I get into this later talking about the spirit being amen our Compass amen the spirit is our compass that directs us to the North Star which is the absolute to the universe and to light and so forth you know but but even the Holy Spirit you might say even the Holy Spirit isn't your absolute why sounds kind of strange but brother says you can have the Holy Spirit every day of your life and go to hell amen so you can be anointed I don't know if any of y'all have noticed and I'll just say this but if you notice some of the church world out there and the anointing that they have the dancing that they do the screaming and the falling out and oh boy just all they they got as much as the bride does you're all quiet now but yeah they've got they've got anointing amen that's right CU how many knows it's a FAL it's a real genuine anointing on false people so what you can't go by that you can't go by Miracles you can't go by signs and wonders and all of that cuz even they do know things so that's not your all one that's not your tyst how many that this right here is your tyst it has to come according to the word this word is that North Star anything contr to that word folks and how many know B says you know you can M you might speak in tongues you might dance and all and shout and all of that other stuff that's all wonderful and great but then it comes down to by their fruits you shall know them how many believes it's down in your soul you've got to get it down in your soul it better be down in your soul it better be what you really really are amen because those with pants on on and makeup on and cut all those oh they scream and shout and fall out under the spirit they prophesy they speak in tongues and all of that but look at the life and if it denies the word it's not God they're not of God Amen it's a sticky thing folks it's a tricky thing oh I like it I don't I like the anointing I don't I don't like to have a service without the anointing but they feed on the anointing they feed on they pull on it huh right they can get it down on them just as much as anybody sometime we don't get it on us enough and everybody said and woo yeah I love it but it's got to be according to the word of God it is the absolute heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away you better be tied to that post when you I don't care who fall I don't care what church was I don't care how much mess is around the church I know that the word of God is right and I know my experience with God you better have that you better have that rock you better be abs it's something that's solid it don't move an absolute don't move how me glad for [Applause] that amen the ultimate the absolute what a glorious thing he says when you get married he means oh my there had to wind back through your mind something till you hit the that tie poost and it should be maybe she isn't this prettiest John's wife or she well she's not as this or that but there's something about her it strikes you you say she might not be as pretty as the other one he might not be as handsome as the other guy how many know but said might smell like a PO cat have feet like a box car the well there's something that strikes there listen that person is that person is different there's stairs where you hold to that if that isn't there you better not get married that tyos that absolute how many believe you better have a revelation of your mate a revelation of your wife or your husband then you won't have to wonder about it down the road then you ready to get married praise the lord we can think of many many who had absolutes in the Bible all down through the stream of time is that right anybody that has ever amounted a hill of being believed in Jesus Christ they had their TI poost and that TI poost was Jesus Christ that was a personal relationship a personal daily walk with God Amen you can't beat that people that daily walk with God that's simple humble every day walk with God some people want oh this great thing oh great why don't you just live a simple humble Christian life and all that other stuff will come huh we've got way too much around the message people oh you better listen to this preacher or that preacher they that the other anytime a preacher wan to be great and this that amen stand out just preach the message all right and shut up right because anytime you do that you always get into trouble brother brandom could have been the greatest ever but he always humbled himself I'm just your brother he stayed where he should be we should stay where we are supposed to be amen kinds of special doctrines that you think everybody had have this praise the Lord Brother brand brought in job sickness came the Bible says that that would would prosper and that you're in hell he lost all of his Prosperity he lost all of his health and yet he was anchored had an absolute he knew that he had talked to God and he knew that there was a God I don't know God ever told him now Jo get ready because I'm telling the devil to come after you I'm GNA turn him loose on you he just went into it these things just happened wouldn't it be nice if God give you a heads up hey look out tomorrow's going to be a real different day for you H and if you you're living this life you are going to have some bad stuff come down the way we're not in heaven yet folks things happen that we don't expect the way that we don't expect it and everything else but God in the midst of it all if you can say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord worship him anywhere worship Him the good times worship Him the bad time times worship when it's hot worship when it's cold it don't matter the weather it don't matter the condition you still praise be to God you got absolute you ain't tattooing yourself you ain't got a wishy-washy and Float with this and Float with that and wonder what kind of male or female you want you ain't got to wonder about that because you got absolute that's what I'm talking world when people don't even know Supreme Court Justice don't know what a woman is my God how's she ever going to judge anything you can't even judge something that's simple you're not fit there ain't none of you fit to be in there you all step down same sex B you made a misjudgment you'll answer to God for it amen oh boy that's the truth ain't it too but that that's the truth you talk about uncertainty how many knows we've had so much uncertainty amen wavering wishy-washy Jude if you want to read somebody that's don't have anchor don't have absolute read the book of Jude remember in the days when God brought the children of Israel out and he brought them toity and afterwards destroy them that believe not why because those tests those Trials of whether they had an anchor or not amen it proved they didn't have an anchor they didn't have a revelation they were not Believers amen oh my started on down amen all down through the Bible we could go but we won't go very far let's talk about some of the latest things around here I've got wrote down here amen amen started how many know when some lot of this uncertainty started this wavering it's when Obama went after the police because you're going to have bad cops get rid of the bad cops but don't dismiss the whole police force don't begin to say well now we're going to come against because you know it set as you all see what this atmosphere of everybody everybody against cops everybody against kind set the stage for it now huh that's right cuz you're not tied to no absolute it went from there get rid of the cop and after that it wasn't long we me a little more of just wavering and floating with the tide so to speak no anchor for us and for the world with the thing with transgender is that right transgender and then this world cancel all women's because you know the guys are going to get there in there and whoop them so why even to go hello y'all are quiet to have a man go up there and you know think he's a woman and beat women you s you are the biggest I've ever met and the biggest loser I have ever [Applause] met loser you may have won but you're a loser you know if you can't win if you beat women is all you can beat yeah step up to the men you couldn't beat him could you that's right you couldn't oh my so you had to go beat a woman has a lot for you I can have my job any day but somebody's got to tell the truth isn't that right that's a preacher's job is to tell the truth you called to be a preacher you're called to tell the truth if you don't think so you go back and listen to brother bam what he said about Kennedy and all these other as all these other things of the government and so forth right all of the devil anyway amen amen and then here how many know just yesterday or the day before The Supreme Court would not take up a certain schools amen that I believe it was schools that wanted to have you know boys B restroom and the girls restrooms you know they wouldn't take it up so now that'll all say take it up that right and you know what else you know what the biggest thing here lately and me brother Glenn brought it to my attention a little bit and I looked at it sure enough the pope now is telling his priests to bless LGB same seex marriages isn't that right now he's asking them to do the leader of the world churches how many knows he is the leader of all denominational churches there maybe say amen that's exactly right the methodists will get along with the Pope really good because they've got homosexual preachers now and so if he blesses them hey they'll fit right on in amen oh but I wrote down rule timately he'll become the Beast that but one thing he isn't he is garly he isn't the brides leader just the church world Amen denominational systems the Harlot the mother of harlots brother Bri you know I could get you shot right up like get could get you killed I guess it's called or whatever they had a big something and put you in a very good full of razor blades and then close it in in on him yeah that's what I'd be happening to me if it was still the Dark Ages amen because that's what what they did folks oh boy here we go is that all right all right so that's right that's uncertainty isn't it that's right praise the Lord Pope blessing it I had a thought you know I thought that the I thought that the Catholics don't change they don't change for nobody and nothing boy that ain't true that sure ain't true no not after taking that up you wouldn't have thought he'd do it but he did now guess what his anti-abortion stand huh when is he going to change his mind about all that if he hadn't already H but anyway I think it'd be a good time to try to convert some Catholics Brother Hey kid leader sanctions same TX you that what you are if you sit under that you are that's good as a homosexual you Endor homosexuality you endorse same-sex marriages if you go to a Catholic Church woo might want to get out of there might want to come to the truth might want to come to the absolute see the absolute it don't change the truth is the truth and we stay with the truth no matter what amen they've down Through the Ages they didn't care about Catholicism or anything else stay Stayed with the word if it cost them their life because they were tied to an absolute amen how many knows a home a home has to have an absolute the Bible says the head of the man is Christ ain't that right Christ is the head of the man I looked it up and the head of Christ is God the head of the man and head of the woman is a man amen and what is what is a uh what is under a man a pastor that's right a wife brother called the mothers teaching them kids kids you're a little pastor of your house is that right then it's under that it's the kids if you don't have that order what have you got I've lived long enough to know that if a person won't subject themselves to the pastor huh there's a problem there's a problem there you either be subject to your pastor or not amen if I can't tell you to do something do that you do it go ahead amen God will deal with you amen we all got to be subject to somebody a that right Paul said follow me as I follow Christ people are ashamed to say people almost ashamed anymore to say I follow brother brandom I'm not ashamed to say I follow brother I follow the prophet of God because he followed Christ he was our star he was our messenger that's right they followed Moses they followed Paul PA they followed Jesus they follow John the Baptist ultimately you're following Christ is that Lord amen praise the Lord job everything went wrong for him but he held true didn't he amen oh my how we could go through Daniel the three Hebrew children David all tied to an absolute amen I like David how many know he was so tied to an absolute that it didn't matter how big the Goliath was Paul he says even Paul was high and brother bam didn't read the scriptures I did he read read the scriptures where he was telling King agba about his vision that he had Ain that right I was not a disobedient to the heavenly vision and Paul wasn't afraid to testify to King agria butam says because he was tied to an absolute amen Paul wasn't afraid at all he wasn't afraid to die because he was tied to an app oh death where is your string oh gve where is your Victory but I thank God because I'm tied to an absolute how many people we have a we have an anchor the hope that we have within us we have as an anchor of the soul that which enter into the inside of the veil on the inside of the inside you got to be anchored you might have your parents experience well my mom and dad's good but you got to have your own personal walk experience with God each 20 years or so in pulpits had great congregations and after their parents passed away they went off into false do even believe Brother band was a you can say it you can quote the quote you can preach the preaching you can preach to Revelation and everything else but because of from your mind huh amen but what about when that anchor or your anchor leaves then what do you got are you going to keep going there or what are you going to do and you fall apart children of God do not fall apart I don't care amen come of uh I don't know come bad times or high waters ain't that right your anchor will hold the anger hold though the ship is battered the anger holds amen though the Sails are Tor that's why we can shout on the wednes tonight because we've got something that is something so solid amen all the gates of hell will not move move you it won't change you you don't have to be like the world that's just drifting like ra Raging Waves of the sea wandering Stars amen going from Pillar To Post not knowing where you stand you're this way one day you're that way down one day you believe this one day then you believe something else the next day we don't have to be like that we've got the sayth the Lord say what that Prophet said and shut up say what the Bible says and shut up we don't want to hear [Applause] it that's why I got this that's why I quote the prophet that's why I say what he said preach what he preached there's rapturing faith in these messages this is message we'll take this to the rapture we don't got nothing else coming some people want to act like there's something else coming like there's more I don't say there's not more of God but we've got the perfect word the perfect interpretation of the word we don't need interpreters amen it's already been interpreted a lot of times that's when we get in trouble trying to figure it out like mother bam said amen oh my praise the Lord you love him am praise the Lord if the house goes up contrary to the blueprint the contractor will tear it down and rebuild it but he's got to go according to the Bible the blueprint how many believe that your life has to match up with this I'm here to tell you both here and in those streaming if you're life you're claiming to be a Christian and the bride and your life is not matching up this yet God will have to do some tearing down he will have to rip you up he'll have to tear into you he'll have to tear them two by fours out he'll have to tear that wall down I don't care if he's got electric wires I don't care if it's already pmed I don't care what it if if it's wrong it's got to come out get out of there it's got out Lord help us cuz we're going to heaven and I want everything that's on Christ out of my life that's it that's what I'm here for today that's what we come on Sunday that's what we come to church for that's why we listen to CH God take this out of me God take that out of me we want to build this house right that's right according to the word of God then you can never you never have to back up oh I like it if you're on the word of God you ain't never got to back up oh my just like arguing with somebody about the baptism in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost you ain't got to back up show me one place show me one place to every baptizing the titles of Father Son and the Holy Ghost if you're right I'll give you a million dollars if you show me one place where they baptized in the titles of f don't say name don't say name because they didn't baptize in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost but they B in the titles of father they go Peter never used the titles I baptize you in father son don't never did he use the name and many and they try to tell you well use title no you're wrong no matter how much you argue you're still wrong amen you love him praise the Lord all right let's go down to a few other things shall we brother bam talks about the Stars there's a lot of stars out there how many know every other every Star out there rotates it moves we could even look at the Seven Stars they come and they go they rotate but there's one star that's out there that does not move how many of these there's it does it just stays right there it's Christ it's his word it stays the same yesterday today and forever for our lost person amen all you got to do is to look at that North Star you'll know where you're at but every another star moves you can't rely on that stay with the North Star a lot of people got a revelation to this out of the other but you better stay with the North Star oh my listen to what he says you know we got a lot of stars but there's only one true star that don't move that's a nor star cuz he sits in the center of the earth no matter where you're whether you're on the back side upside wherever you're at the North Stars is just the same it's your North Star now see there's a lot of stars place but if you're in the sea any Sean knows any hunter knows that roams the woods knows your North Star is the your place that's all then it's like your compass your compass won't point you to Mars or Jupiter or somewhere else It'll point you to the north star that is your absolute no matter what your experience is then if something you tells you the Bible isn't true the power of God the Apostles the prophets the pastors the teachers the gift of the spirit just isn't the same as it was when it flowed through the apostles at Pentecost there's something wrong with your absolute it has to tie to a denominational Creed instead of the Bible amen when he said both heavens and earth will pass away but my absolute will never pass away amen praise the Lord listen and then he says and you have a ball game you got to have an absolute listen got to have an absolute no matter if you don't uh listen he walks out there talking about the umire how many knows the absolute for a ball game is an Umpire and you know what I figured out brother Peter I figured out that an AB an ump is the absolute perfect what He says is perfect no everyone of us would say no I've seen some guys call an imperfect call but guess what if he called it that's what it is it's perfect in that way he makes it perfect as a matter of fact you get too R of your brother Brad right you get a little too rowy he'll say you out of here he can kick you pump out of the game and get you off the whatever I'm not sure what degree that goes to you know but just about anybody he can you gone go get face and push me a little I'll tell you what I'll K you I got the power I got the I'll P cast you P out of here when he points to that guard that cop or whatever says that's all you got to do they're comeing to grab them arms they're out you're out of here why because you have to have it brother bam says man you would have fusses how many knows that you would have fusses about every play every about every call of the ball his parents oh parents nowadays especially are you with me that was not a ball that was a you know that was not a strike it was a ball can you imagine having to listen to all that no I think no not I really I think it was what about you over there somebody else said no I think it's a strike no I think it was a b my gracious can we say that when we were still in this 900 different churches that's how we acted well now we got the truth no well they got the truth no well this is the truth no well that's the truth but Jesus Christ come on the scene and Vindicated I mean know he's our umpire what he says is truth what Christ says is the truth let every man's word be a lie and mind the truth he says he's our ire he's the ire of our game you know how many fusses we have in the church and it's a preacher's job to keep things [Music] straight you know you get a preacher I've been I've been slacked there's times where I just did not deal with things the way I should have hello and if you let things go it only gets worse it's just like kids is't that right if you let it get you let it go it gets worse somebody has to call it out somebody got to deal with it amen you got to call black black and white even though sometimes you don't want to it te to hide off of you but you got to do it amen got to have an absolute he's he's the absolute anyway even if you don't like him he's the absolute his word is final no matter what you say about it it's that way now if you didn't the whole game would go into chaos that's what he says how many knows that we've arrived there the world has arrived there that one of the first things quotes that I remember that came to my mind amen when I thought about this absolute was a little bit further back here brother man makes a stat me let me tell you I'll tell you now no sir politics will never work no sir democracy will never work democracy is rotten to the Bone now I'm going to ask you kind of a and I like to ask a question sometimes what would it take for democracy to work what would it take for what does it take for a democracy like America to work it's something that some of our for forefathers even said who should run it who should run the Democracy in order for to work who should run it do you know well I'm fixing to tell you if it could be run and if I'm not wrong some of our forefathers even said that that if it's as long as it's run by Christians it'll work but when you put it out there in the world it becomes all sales and no no anchor Amen in other words there's no absolute anymore when unbelievers and sinners get a hold of it amen how many knows the left how bad they hated when Trump put what three conservative justices they got lost their minds they loost their minds another is five decades we've been put back because you're going to be there on for a lifetime they just lose lost their mind they went conservative judges on there that won't really uphold the Constitution amen that's the truth cuz how many know uh uh rule on a certain way that's how it'll be cuz they are the ultimate of our nation how many knows they're Above the Law they're above the law what I mean by that is they judge whether or not the laws that congress makes is constitutional or not if they say that law they just pass is unconstitutional that law is gone I don't care how many Congress made it am I right they there judging has damned this nation amen all sales no anchor just like Jude just like Israel all sails no anchor trials came Trials come and what did they do open their mouth and murmur wasn't there enough graves in Egypt huh that you brought us out here to die but thank be to God there's some Joshua and calebs amen some Joshua and calebs were're more than able just hold still can I say something tonight if you going through a trial or whatever comes your way just hold still be still hold still watch God work you can't get through it can't get over it can't get under it can't get around it been there many times just stand still and hand it to God and watch God Work wi now one thing Brother Brad I've learned about a church is you can't run a run a church you got to let the Holy Ghost run a church the Holy Ghost is good at running a church I got to keep myself out of the way so God can do it amen no matter what portion it has to be God doing it and I got to be careful to keep myself out of the way every one of you sitting there have to be careful don't get yourself in the way or you'll mess this place up amen you can do a lot of damage in this place get one person out of line ain't that right youen lose your absolute let your flesh or your feelings or your hurt feelings be your absolute and you'll make a chaos mess out of this place Lord help us to stay Anchored In Jesus the St of Life are brave I've Anchored In Jesus I fear no in or wave I've Anchored In Jesus for he had power to save I've anchored in the Rock of Ages let's sing that shall we we'll stop right there that be okay amen we could go on all night but we won't keep you that long tonight amen let me see I've got that somewhere
