sunday school amen morning brothers and sisters ask us to open our bibles the second corinthians 6. we'll read that whole chapter the last verse together it'll be second corinthians 6. we then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of god in vain giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed and straps imprisonments and torments and labors and watchings and fastings [Music] by the word of truth by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged now for recompense in the same i speak as unto my children be also enlarged what community and what concord have christ with bella and what part hath he that believeth with an infidel of god wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch is not an unclean thing and i will receive you and i will be your father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty brother david you can all be seated god bless you all i was uh in my office this morning i wrote this down i think the last time we actually had an adult son this school i think i wrote it down was like the 15th of march in 2020 so that's how long it's been but since it's been a while um i was going to get if you want you can turn with me to uh titus the second and third chapter but i haven't done this in a while i usually do this every couple of months before i get started but you know you could spend years just preaching out of or teaching out of that uh sixth chapter of corinthians ii corinthians there's a lot of nuggets in there but i wrote i wrote something down today and you know the thing about being a good father a good leader a good minister or whatever a good friend is do they the thing about that is they have to know your mind they always have to know your mind they've got to know exactly what you're going to do and how you're going to do something that way they have confidence in you that no matter what happens you're always going to be either the same man or the same woman no matter what doesn't mean you don't have bad situations in your life or bad things or good things but in everything then people will have confidence in you no matter what the situation is they can rely on you to be there and do the right thing and you know being an old army man that that's an important thing your men need to know your mind they need to know exactly what you're going to do and when you're going to do it if they don't then you'll never be successful it's no different with being a father of a christian family whether you run a business everyone has to know exactly who you are and what you are and if they don't if you're wishy-washy they'll have no confidence in you and and that's why you see the world the way it is is because men and women are not consistent they don't they don't believe things the way they should and they don't do things the way they should but i was going to do this like i'm being myself you have to forgive me for that i can only be myself um this is the church church's uh financial report right now in the uh i don't mean to accuse i confuse anyone uh right now if i were to show you the checkbook we would have sixteen thousand six hundred and eighty eight dollars and some change but uh someone's made a uh missionary offering twice so with additional there's 2600 out of that account that's not been earmarked any mission fund yet so that would leave a total unspent you know unallocated and there's some in there for the for the youth banquet too um of about fourteen thousand dollars there's change that's in the general fund right now and then we had a men's meeting uh we had a meeting of the not so much men's meeting but of the trustees deacons and the pastor a couple of months ago and we decided to try to start paying off the actual church loan and uh which i've been doing and we're down to 89 000 so out of 200 000 we're down to uh 89 000. the mature date of the loan is uh i think it's october of 2030. so uh it shouldn't be we stay paying 500 here 700 here we should pay it off a few years early in the building account which i make that a payment out and there are some people i've told you before that stole you know so put money into the building account we have uh 2100 and change the things that we've spent money on in the last several months as you all know we had to do that repair on the water we've had big water bills we also bought a building well that was in december january time frame we bought that building we've also bought long lawn equipment in for doing the lawn up here we bought the lawnmower before we even had covid we had the lawnmower before we even then so that's where we're at right now with the uh with the funds if you like i said if you have any questions don't be afraid to come up and ask me i am approachable even though i seem like i'm hard on the outside i am approachable uh if you would go with me to a titus i had that place marked this morning you'll have to forgive me i can talk for hours and not even read anything but um i was thinking us as as men and as people and that's what brother branham was talking about and i probably don't even have that he was talking about this morning in the devotional i'll just read a few sentences at the end he's talking about stephen about how stephen no matter what the pharisees were saying he held his testimony and he sealed it with his death and you know and what kind of example was that for us as christians or for the christians in his day that was a great example that you could be victorious in death or in life you can still be victorious i'll just i will read all of this and that's another anachronism of mine i say i won't read it all and that's all i do is read but i'll uh this is at the end of this day he said you say well how many was there you say there may be five thousand how many of them got he was talking about on the day of pentecost there was one that held a cold cell the young pharisee standing there and consulted gave witness to his death but when he saw the advertisement of the power of the resurrected christ and that little fellow so he's talking about paul was even there and he seen what stephen was was willing to do for for christ it made a dent in his heart if you never got away from him the same man paul the one standing there that morning led tens of thousands of souls to christ because one man was willing to give his life to be an advertisement board for jesus christ what ought to be today and he goes on we do not have to be we don't have to have a big audience we don't have to preach to ten thousands we don't have to even preach we can be an advertisement board how do you know that your life might not start some young man on the gospel some of you older men you older woman them young men on the field out there to win 10 000 souls to christ it's because that they saw christ in you and it's you that presented it to him in the simple power of the gospel basically just being that man or being that woman of christ being that christian and living whatever you are here is the same person when you're at work or you're at home being that same consistent person and showing people that christ lives inside your heart and life that's all you really need to turn people from being bad people to good people and the only way that happens it's it's not by word it's not by deed it's by our relationship with jesus christ but i'll read this uh third chapter and titus here uh you know in the i'm not going to talk about the world but the world is a crazy place i say that a lot i come up here i mean a year ago i said look at where the world is at a year ago now look where we're at now and like brother banham said things are on an acceleration course so what would take five years to happen maybe three or four years ago now it's only it might only take a few weeks for the same thing it just keeps accelerating accelerating hey it all has an end point it has a goal it's all reaching to that goal which is the rapture and the sanctification of the soul that's in this church this morning or the destruction of the world that we live in it's you're either going one way or the other and that's a choice that you make this morning which way you're going to go as an individual but it's accelerating now to that point where you either get on the train or you're going to be totally left behind there's no more you know preachers say it a lot you can't play church anymore you you can't it's no more play time you either believe it and move with it or you're going to get left behind but i'll read what is but paul's talking here put them to mind to subject to principalities and powers to their magistrates be ready for every good work speak evil of no man that's really that speaks to the age we live and that's what people do is talk bad about each other nowadays it's rare it's rare to find someone that you work with that even the he knows that someone has bad character tries to build them up they just try to tear each other down he goes um and he goes speak evil oh no man i lost my place power to match race to be ready to every good work speak evil of no man be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness on to all men you know you nowadays you'll worry if you get into a confrontation with someone if he's going to shoot you nowadays for ourselves also we're sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice envy hateful and hating one another i know all of us can know in a time in our life where these same ideas were in us and we don't want to be like that anymore but after the kindness and the love of god our savior toward man appeared not by the works of right not by the works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercies he saved us by the washing and the regeneration and the renewing of the holy ghost and if i ever say one thing in my life to anybody that talks to me about the lord i always say this one thing you know they no matter what you do how much works you have how much you try which are good things i'm not saying they're not good things it's it's pretty simple you have to totally yield yourself to the presence of jesus christ it's nothing you can do it's something that you got to let god do for you and if you're trying to do it in yourself it's never going to happen and he goes on to say which were shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our savior that being justified by his grace we should be made hairs according to the hope of eternal life and this is a faithful saying and these things i will that thou affirm constantly that they that which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable onto men so paul's also saying here you should have a testimony in your life you shouldn't be the same you should be better each day you go on you should be a better person and doing better things and he goes on to say and this speaks to the age everyone wants to argue about everything nowadays but avoid foolish questions and genealogies contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofessional in vain you can just you can put the new testament in there too you know you can argue with people does it ever change anything it's a they it has to be a revelation if it ain't a revelation you could talk to people into your blue and they'll never change them or they'll never see it your way and do they have to see it your way no you just present it to them and hope they see it your way and he goes on to say paul also says here man that is the heretic after the first and second automation reject knowing that he he is such a verdict and sinneth being condemned of himself and then i'll i'll stop there because he just talks about apollos and paul and these other people he's sending out but the only simple thing i have to say this morning i i won't i i say a lot of things that are cliches i was about to say i won't say the only most important thing you all hear this morning i don't know you where you're at in your lives you know that's the thing about a human being we see the outer man all the time we see that person we've known all life we see that outer person but we never know what's inside that inner person we don't know what's inside that what is suffering is or what a situation is but i can stand here and tell you without a doubt that i know that god knows who you are and i know that god knows what your situation is no matter what i say or what i believe if god's got a blessing for or desire for you i know that he can fulfill it in your heart and life this morning brother david man you're loving with all your heart let's stand this morning when i'm tossed online i see you sister becky well when i'm tossed on my sea and the waves cover me and the dark clouds won't let the sun shine through [Music] well then a boy seems

have a lot of confidence in our father and and not just our earthly but more confidence in our heavenly and we want to take and look at a few things that'll be all for music thank you look at a few things this morning uh kind of uh something was on my mind i feel like things have just led up to this uh with things that were said songs that were saying in the past week week and a half um things that were on my mind and i just kind of brought it into light and one thing that was said brother byler said last sunday i don't know if you caught it uh but he said when i think last sunday when he was preaching he said it seems god gets in a pickle did anybody catch him when he said that it seems god gets in a pickle and i thought man that is so true it looks like many many times throughout the scripture that god finds himself in a place that he can't get out of but when we look at the scripture we know and brother brought it out too god is always in control god is never going to get caught in a pickle uh he may look like it he may seem like it but he's always right there i want to turn in your scriptures if you would to exodus 14 familiar scripture and i want to read this quote before we get started if i could brother brown says all right he said that's his word and his written word tonight is a seed listen now he says if the written word tonight is a seed that'll take life as soon as you believe his word it's just the same authority to night over all sickness is to bring your faith back to him quicken it right back see make it quickened so the word tonight is a seed and we have to realize it every time we read the word we place that seed into our hearts and we begin to nurture it and fertilize it and we begin to take that that seed and as soon as that seed if we believe that that seed is going to grow that seed is going to come forth and upon our belief all things are possible exodus 14. familiar scripture we've heard the story many many times it's not new nothing in the bible's new i i kind of get tickled a time or two when i hear people talk about well yeah i've heard that a hundred times well you know it's the foolishness of preaching it's been preached over and over and over and over but we still need it so exodus 14 and 10. let's look at verse 10. and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness now watch moses and moses said unto these people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today listen for the egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see what confidence moses had that god had spoken to him and placed him into a position to tell the children of israel these people that you see the enemy that's binding you the people that is holding you back and has encamped you as slaves for years and years after today you will see them know more what confidence the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the lord said to moses wherefore christ thou unto me speaking to the children of israel that they go forward but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry land through the midst of the sea verse 30 thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the seashore and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and people feared the lord they believed the lord and his servant moses let's just pray heavenly father we thank you for this day we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy lord we thank you for our fathers uh lord those are still with us and we just appreciate the the knowledge and the wisdom and the goodness and the confidence we have in our father but lord we turn our confidence today and we just want to lift up our heavenly father lord our heavenly father that does so much for us and who died upon the cross for us lord we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you for that and for being our heavenly father lord jesus we just want to commit the service into your hands we just asked lord that you would move in a mighty way that you would come and anoint the lips of the speaker this morning and the ears and the hearts of those that can hear father we just asked or the word would go forth and go deep down into our hearts this morning to draw us close to you the word as it goes forth lord that it would draw us close to you and lord that it would give us confidence and that the word would challenge us lord and that the word would give us the faith and the hope and the belief that we need to make a rapture in this last day lord we just give you all honor and glory and in your precious name we pray amen amen you can have your seats i didn't really prepare this for a father's day message uh and and uh you know i didn't really look at it that way but the more i looked at it and the more i thought about it it's probably going to slide right in and tie right into a father's day mess this is when we talk about how great our god is how great our heavenly father is and like we said you know brother balor made that statement about jesus seems to get himself in a pickle and many times in our life we go through life and we find ourselves in a pickle we find ourselves in a mess and our life seems like it's just torn up and in turmoil and we find ourselves in a mess and brother branham says that they were standing in this place he said they were in this jeopardy and that word jeopardy it means of risk it means harm it means harms out there it's available it could even mean death so he says they're standing there in this jeopardy and they've got the mountains on this side and the red sea had cut them off and pharaoh's army marching on steadily and it seemed like all nature would scream for them so they're in a place that all of nature is looking down upon this situation as it unfolds and the prophet said that nature itself looks like they will scream for them brothers and sisters this is a dire situation that they're in a dire situation that they're in and brother branham said oh god loves to get his children in those kinds of places and he said and i'm glad of it we didn't ask for these kind of situations we didn't wake up this morning say god put me against a red sea and put an enemy a pharaoh and my enemies coming against me but he said god loves to put his children in those kinds of places i'm glad of it he said it's the greatest experience of my life when i get against something that i can't get over i can't get around i can't get under i just stand still and watch god make a way through it i stand there and watch god make a way through it he said here stood israel mountains desert pharaoh's army and the red sea what a time but it just so pleased god that's hard swallow sometimes brother brown said that he believed one writer said he looked down and he said he said it like this he looked down through the pillar of fire with angered eyes god in heavenly places looking down upon this situation pleased with where the children of israel are knowing that he's going to defeat this army of pharaoh and he looks down through a pillar of fire and through angered eyes knowing the outcome and the children of israel have themselves backed up against a wall and they're beginning to get scared the red sea got scared he said the children of israel had no reason to be scared after all they had seen in egypt what did they have to be afraid of they didn't have no reason to be scared the prophet said when the god looked down through the pillar fire with angered eyes he said the sea got scared he said the red sea got scared and it just rolled back because god's path led through it sometimes we don't understand in our life how we're going to get from point a to point b we don't know around it over and under we don't know but we know one thing god's got a way for us there it may not be the way one in our minds it may not be an easy road you may feel some pressure in your life but you're gonna make it don't worry if you're following god god will make everything stand still for you to pass through it just take his word follow his spirit he'll make things move out he'll have a house cleaning before you god is good brothers and sisters brothers and sisters how many times in our life have we found ourselves caught between the devil and the sea of life that you felt that there was hope in other words you find yourself there trapped between an impenetrable object and pharaoh and the enemies behind you the mighty enemies pushing you nowhere to run nowhere to hide no way of escape you've been where the israelites have been you've walked where the children of israel have walked you've felt there you've been you've escaped the slavery you've been in this slavery you've been in that bondage you've been right there hemmed against the red sea and the armies of egypt against you ready to kill you the armies of egypt ready to take you back to re-enslave you or to kill you into egypt you see these children of israel have been slaves for a long time these children have been raised in slavery over and over in their minds they were no more than slaves suffering in the slavery they know what their heritage is they know where their roots lay and out of sadness of this slavery they begin to cry out to god god please send something you come free as god and god begins to look down upon them and he hears their cry and he sends moses you know the glory laying a foundation here moses comes in in the situation and he begins to confront pharaoh and moses divine demands israel's release what pharaoh do yeah you just go ahead take them off no no it don't come like that now it don't come like that pharaoh refused over and over and over so much that god begins to now send plagues upon the face of the earth upon the upon egypt and he wants to punish pharaoh for his stubbornness for not letting his people go you know along about the tenth plague when all the firstborn of egypt was killed except for the israelites who was underneath the blood token egypt finally began to begin to see the picture of what god was doing god finally put him into a misha place where he says i'm going to let these people go he's going to kill every one of us so here now is pharaoh and he says to moses rise up go away from here take your people take your cows take your animals take everything and leave me now brother sister it appears at this point that that old devil's thrown in the towel he's giving up he's quit what'd you say sister johnny's no ma'am that's right she said no no he didn't give up he's not going to lay down and quit but here's the children of israel leaving egypt headed towards the promised land a land flowing with milk and honey you know the word honey in the bible means prosperity if you've got honey in the bible you're prosperous and they're going to a land where i'm fixing to prosper things are looking good everything seems good i'm free they're thinking in their minds i'm free no more bricks to make no more bondage no more orders to take no more lashing of the whips of the slaves and the task masters i'm gonna be free life is good oh it seems that way but what happened after their departure pharaoh kind of had to change heart pharaoh thinking what am i going to do about my kingdom who's going to build my monuments who's going to build the snakes who's going to build the pyramids who's going to build this kingdom of mine and raise me up and put me up on a pedestal make me look good who's going to do it i can't let these people go so he calls his commanders and says listen i want you to go get all the chariots we got over 600 armed chariots and he goes and gets all these chariots six of all the officers and he begins to pursue the devil don't roll over and die the devil's not going to just lay down and quit he's not a quitter has anybody in here ever thought in your mind that you've won a battle man i've overcome i've won the battle i tell you i'm on fire and god is good and you wake up the next morning find out the battle's still there you wake up and you find out that this war that we're in is made up of many battles and you may have prayed for deliverance and you know that god has moved on the scene you know that god has been there and but now all of a sudden you wake up and those thoughts shouldn't be happening anymore you're still there but i thought you was a christian i thought you'd give that to god i thought you laid at the altar but they're still there what's happened they're still there the anger the temper that i had it's still there just being honest that depression that fear that hate that anxiety that jealousy that doubt all those things they're back they're back they're back but god i made a move i made a move when i left my seat and come up to the altar i made a move to you god i made an exodus in my life there was an exit took place and i said i'm leaving this and i'm never going back are you with me what is that what is that when you walk away you made the move the exodus you've made an exodus in your life you've come up to the altar you've laid it down and all of a sudden you wake up and it's still there what is that that's pharaoh's army chasing you down that's pharaoh's army chasing you down to come and add you and pull you back into that torment that you just walked away from so here it happens at this egyptian army they begin to come up to the israelites at the red sea and they begin to overtake them and here's israel caught between the devil and the sea how could this happen well the first thing that we think happens in our lives is what did i do wrong what did i do wrong god where did i make the mistake i thought i'd give everything i thought i laid it all down and what did i do to come right back into this and if that's not what your thoughts if it's somebody on the outside you're in the church you're thinking what did they do wrong when you see them go right back into their ways what did they do wrong where's the sin in the camp it's our nature and they begin to wonder and we begin to wonder what is all this but brother and sister in this instance they didn't do anything wrong they didn't make one wrong move if they didn't they didn't get there at the red sea because of their poor choices they didn't get there because they took a wrong turn on the way they didn't get there because moses made a mistake and leading them out of the out of egypt that wasn't a mistake moses didn't make that mistake but what did they accuse him of moses was it because there were no graves in egypt that you've taken us into the wilderness to die what did you bring us out here for what did you bring us out of egypt wouldn't it be better for us to serve the egyptians than to die in the wilderness that's man's thinking that's the way man looks at these situations but that's not the way god looks at these situations here they are the israelites not trapped by any error of their own but look they were trapped by pharaoh's decision to pursue them that simple you know why because god said i personal pronoun i will harden pharaoh's heart and he will pursue them you mean to tell me that god the god of the children of israel hardened pharaoh's heart and made pharaoh pursue israel you mean to tell me that god was involved in pharaoh's choice that god was involved in setting this trap stay with me you see israel got caught between the devil and the red sea because god put them there god put them there it says god led the people to round about way through the wilderness to the red sea go on down and it says the refers to the angel of god who went before israel's of the israelite army leading them along the way and said god told moses tell the israelites to turn back and count by the sea wow and over over and over and over but we forget that god is in control of every situation no matter how bad the outcome looks god is in control so it's very clear god is involved god is in control so if you find yourself in a difficult place maybe you're there because god put you there [Music] just maybe god put you there for a specific purpose maybe god put you for his purpose maybe why did god put israel in such a difficult and dangerous place why did he put him there between the devil and the red sea he put him there because he wanted to show the devil that he's going to defeat him and he wanted to bring glory to himself and he wanted to build their faith we need faith as believers we need faith let me tell you why we need faith we believe in a resurrection that the dead in christ shall rise let's take a step forward we believe in a rapture you got to have a lot of faith to believe that to people that don't believe this to atheists and people we are lunatics we're howling at the moon okay so it takes a lot of effect for us to get ourselves up there we have to put ourselves in such a place that our faith gets built and built and built and the prophet said that sometimes god puts us in those places proving to listen listen to who to prove to the weakest of christians that you can defeat satan anywhere anytime with the simple plain word of god how many is the wicked christian i'll raise my hand i'm a weak christian i fail daily so i need god i need to be put in those kind of situations even though i don't like them so that god continually lifts my faith up and says you can make it you can make it you can make it you win so many times this word we hear you lose you lose you lose you're not going to make it you're no good you're no count but god's trying to tell you you're going to make it you're going to win brother and sister god wanted to increase israel's faith by demonstrating his power on their behalf so he brings them up to the sea and he takes and he parts the water and the children of israel go walking along on dry land with walls of water you know there's people that try to disprove it and they try to say they walked across on a dry spot they walked across on reeded ground where the reeds were it was a dry drought it was this that the other but the bible that i read tells me that there was walls of water walls of water so great that when they walked across and the army of egypt follow him across that when moses waved his south again the walls consumed the egypt army and the bible says that not one of them remain what was the effect of this on israel israel began to see a great work israel began to see what god was doing for them and they remembered what god saw what moses said when he said fear not in our first scripture for this today these people you see you will see them no more ever here's god's word the spoken word that was given to moses and moses put it out there now coming to pass and the israel have to look at and say oh my goodness we've arrived brother sister don't forget the great works in your life don't ever forget the great works that god has done in your life like i said there's many times people will try to put you down they will try to downplay walk with god they will try to make you less than what god has you at but don't ever let that begin first in your mind don't ever let build and build and build off your experiences with god did god save your soul build on it did god deliver you from cigarettes build on it did god deliver you from alcohol build on it did god deliver you from lying and hatred build on it nobody put you back to egypt because those remain no more your faith will get stronger and stronger and stronger if god puts you between the devil and the red sea of life it's a personal experience to you it's your personal experience at the red sea so that he can deliver you so that you can build your faith and whenever god puts you in a hard place like that he's not going to defeat the devil by working in some kind of miracle and deliverance on your behalf or he's going to glorify himself in the eyes of others as they watch how you walk through that trial and then he's going to build your faith and increase your faith as you leaned upon him in a time of trial and trouble so what we have to do is learn to do what the children of israel did in the times of trouble we have to learn to call god on the scene and if i was going to title this anything today it would be calling god on the scene because brother says that's the first thing they did when the pressure came they called out to god and i can imagine from a distance that they could hear those horses hooves in the background and as they looked over their shoulder they see the billowing clouds of dust and the nostrils of the horses flare coming as hard as they can looking into the eyes of those soldiers and warriors that we're going to pull them back to the life they just left gonna pull them back into a sinful condition satan now that's the way he works gonna pull them back so the first thing they did in exodus 14 they cried out as pharaoh drew neal the israelites looked back and they saw the egyptians advancing upon them and in great fear the israelites cried out to the lord you see prayer puts us in touch with the resources of heaven do you know that prayer is your conduit to god and i'll tell you what i find myself some sometimes so many times that i don't have the conduit flowing to god the way it should we get busy in life you know we talk about that a lot but it's the truth we have if you want to get close to god we have to have that conduit between god and keep going and keep going to god because in jeremiah 33 3 it says god says call unto me and i will ask thee and show fighting things which thou knowest not we don't even know the mightiness of god we can't even fathom what god is capable of doing you think about this red sea situation that's uncomprehendable but god did it and god can continue to do that so when we're in these problems and when we things going on we need to pray we need to call god on the scene quit our grumbling and complaining because that's exactly what what got them in trouble they said to moses were there no graves in egypt did you bring us out here until we could die in the wilderness wouldn't it be better if we were in egypt and serving this the egyptians brother and sister prayer puts you in touch with the power of god so if prayer puts you in touch the power of god what does bumbling and complaining do it shuts that conduit down that conduit between you and god as you're praying and he's listening and he's answering and you feel his presence and you feel it you feel the deliverance you feel that to us and then all of a sudden well i tell you what if i could have done this i would have done different if i would have done this or if they hadn't said this i wouldn't be here and complaining the preacher preaches too long the music's too loud the drummer hits the snare grumbling and complaining you pinch that conduit down god can't hear you when you're grumbling and complaining why would god listen to that well he'll put up with it for a while yeah he'll put up with it for a while he'll get by with it for a little while that's what he did in this situation the children vision they grumble to complain did you ever see in the bible where he said anything about it to him not in this situation but what happened in numbers 11 when they began to grumble and complain they they begin to grumble and complain and they complain and it says the lord heard their grumbling complaining and was anger kindled against them it says then the fire of the lord burned against them brothers and sisters let me tell you something we don't want the fire of god burning against us we want the fire of god burning against our enemies the one that's pushing us and trying to get us to come back that's where we want that so we need to quit our murmuring quit our complaining paul says do all things without murmuring and arguing so that you may be blameless and innocent children of god without blemish in the midst of what a crooked and perverse generation i believe i heard somebody mention something about the generation we're living in now believer brian before service talked about the day we live in the perversion the wickedness the crookedness no murmuring no complaining when we call god on the scene amazing things happen we're going to talk about some of the amazing things that's happened we just talked about the children of israel at the red sea but let's look at here when jesus comes and he's been teaching all day and he's in the he's been at the uh going through the parables that he's tired and he's exhausted and he says let's cross over to the other side of the lake and so jesus gets in a boat and him and his disciples they start out across the sea and leave him behind them the crowd they're trying to follow him still they've loaded their boats and they're going where jesus is going they're going to follow jesus anywhere he goes but then all of a sudden a fierce storm comes up so here's the storm comes up and these high waves were breaking into the boat and the boat began to fill with water and jesus was in the back of the boat sleeping with his head on a cushion they're afraid they're going to drown so they come up and jesus they wake him up and says jesus jesus wake up and he says silence be still think about this silence be still these men fishermen were completely terrified and they look at this and they think who is this man they'd seen him work they'd seen his teachings they'd seen some miracles but here now their life was in jeopardy their life is in jeopardy and brothers and sisters this storm came this fierce storm and what are storms their tests the storms of life are the tests and you and then when you go through these storms you'll discover yourself exactly what you're made of storms have a way about revealing the truth about who you are on the inside you either live by fear or you live by faith storms reveal if your heart is full of trust or full of doubt storms the way you react to god during a storm reveals whether you want him or you don't storms happen suddenly storms happen suddenly the bible says in verse 37 the soon a fierce storm came up we look up fierce there it means seismic now we use the word seismic to describe our earthquakes we have seismic activity of galilee somewhere about 13 miles wide seven seven miles deep 150 50 down to the bottom and here they are with this size activity on the water not a fun place to be not a fun place to be did jesus know this storm was coming absolutely why would we doubt that he did but this storm of life was part of the disciples lesson this norm of life was part of the disciples lesson to teach something about god and to teach them something about themselves fierce the storm was fierce and suddenly quickly that's the way life is one minute everything is good one minute everything is fine and the next minute the bottom falls out it takes one phone call and your world is turned upside down it takes one doctor's visit and you see a seismic activity in your life your world begins to shake your earth begins to quake you're in the middle of a storm one conversation and you're shaken that's the reality brothers and sisters one conversation and your life is changed and what happens many times in storms storms it could cause people to begin to doubt god storms begin to make us doubt god jesus was sleeping in the back of the boat with his head on the cushion and they wake him up shouting teacher don't you care what about to happen to us don't you care what's going on the storm island the sea is shaking these hurricane winds are blowing our boat in all directions don't you care we're talking about experienced fishermen here they knew the sea they knew how to maneuver a boat they knew how to handle the situations like this but here they are in a panic this is more than they've ever dealt with and jesus is in the back of the boat asleep what kind of man is this teacher don't you care that we're going to drown their first concern was drowning many times we get in our life and things begin to smother in on us and we feel like we're rounding in live situations we feel like life is coming down upon us and the sea is raging and we got that seismic earthquake activity and things are raining on us and we're beginning to suffocate and drown but this was a classroom this was more than the sea of galilee this was a classroom this was a place where god had him in a place where he could sit there and he began to teach them the real storms of life you know life is the storms of life are easy when we're in setting in church and the preacher's preaching you think man are you i can associate with that yeah that's me i've been there i've done that i've done this but what is it what kind of education is it when you lose a loved one what kind of education is it when you can't pay your bills what kind of education is it when your health begins to leave your what kind of education is it when your marriage falls apart that's a storm that's a size a storm of seismic activity brothers and sisters that's when god puts us in a place in the middle of that storm and that's when we have to be able to call blood on the sea that's when we have to have that communication that khan do when they said jesus wake up and we got to be able to call jesus on the scene in our storms of life and he comes in and says when be still right let me ask you this question you're gonna like this i got got message believers in here right you're gonna like this let me ask you this question if jesus knew the storm was coming he knew the dangers that left the head why would he put his disciples in that situation why would he risk it why would he go through that knowing that things were coming was it to teach those guys a lesson yeah was it teach those guys to rely on him yes was it to teach him how powerful he was yes there was another story taking place night or two before that he crossed the seas this is the prophet speaking he's been very weary and he had stealed the sea for them crossed way over into gudera crossed way over into gudera and there was a maniac taking the chance of crossing that stormy sea when the devils of the sea swore that they would drown him but he went there listen at the cry of one person these fishermen went through a storm of life jesus had a purpose they learned a lesson sure but jesus is constantly moving he's moving from place to place he's just constantly being about the father's business at the cry of one person one poor maniac lost his mind perhaps a good man one time walked up right before god but probably got in the wrong crowd he might be started in drinking in something and lost his mind now he lives out there in the tombs where the demons lived they put him in chains but he had supernatural powers he'd break those chains and jump on man and beat them and kill them if he could when they come by that poor fella you want to know how god was called on the scene how did god know close probably some of that too brother branham said he had an old gray-headed mother somewhere she knew how to get a hold of god an old gray-headed mother somewhere that was praying for him and jesus he said cross that sea all the way over into godera to give mercy to one man what a god we serve what a god we serve this man he said was a sociable god fearing man there could be anybody sitting in this room a sociable god fearing man but he got out with the wrong crowd he had one two three kids i think he's at home married fine little wife at home that could be anybody sitting here but the prayers of an old gray-headed mother praying for him and here's this fellow legion no hopes living in the tombs with the devils now year after year getting worse and worse and worse so that no man could pass by without him hurting them here's a man now excommunicated from his city excommunicated from his wife his children his mother the whole town pushed him on the outside the darkest hour man we've been up against the red sea with pharaoh breathing down our back we've been in a storm a raging storm when the activity seemed like there was no way you could make it and now here the darkest hour of a man's life the darkest hour of a man's life and jesus comes up there and steps onto the land of gadara and jesus is confronted he runs out to him jesus asks him his name legion legion you understand this is probably the most terrifying account of demon possession in all the bible this man who once had a home now lives in the cemetery and y'all want to live there i don't think so i'm out peace living in a cemetery his home is now within the tombs helpless a man of society helpless a man of wealth at one time naked a man who was exceeding fierce in his life totally unmanageable constantly crying and cutting himself torturing himself these days what's on the inside of him driven by a legion of demons my name is legion this let me tell you this wasn't somebody who just stepped away this wasn't somebody who just fell from grace for a minute this wasn't somebody who just backslid for a day or two legion when you look up the name legion it means 6 000 demons 6 000 demons wrap your wrap your mind around that for a minute can you imagine the battle we face from day to day but this man has six thousand demons six thousand demons that are pushing him and making him act the way he is that has completely taken him away from the life he once knew the good life a life a god-fearing man the prophet said and has taken him away brothers and sisters he needed god on the scene that greyhead had wanted called god onto the scene jesus crossed the raging sea and he takes legion by the hand and delivers him those demonic spirits go into the swine over the cliff they go look at the difference this wretched demonic man's conversion to christ he's now sitting not screaming he's sitting he's praising not cursing he's dressed not naked he's in his right mind not insane he's converted to christ and not a captive of satan no longer brother sisters that's what god has done for us god has come down and delivered us from all demonic powers all the legions that you could face and god has put you in a place that you can go be a witness for him use what god has given you witness for him many preachers type this story how a madman became a missionary how a madman became a missionary how was that you know in many of the many of the time jesus touches somebody he heals somebody he opens blinded eyes he raises somebody from dead and what's he tell them don't tell nobody don't tell nobody but here he told him he said you go and tell everybody what i've done for you you go tell everybody what jesus has done for you and how good he's done to you and what did he do he departed and went to the capitalist and he began to write about the good things of god let me tell you decapolis was a ten city area he didn't just go to his hometown he went right back to the big big town to the cities and he began to witness what god has delivered me from i was that man in the tomb i was that man that was cutting myself i was that man that had to leave my wife and kids but god was called on the scene brother branham said the darkest hour then jesus came along he said could you imagine lead legion going back down to his home and finding where he used to live the little wife had to sell her place and he wondered where she was at and he began to search from place to place and he said finally someone said she lives down in the alley and he said legion goes down there into that little 0-10 shack and he sees the children coming and they run to hide they remember who legion was they remember what he acted like they remember how he treated them and they run to hide and said his wife picked up her shawl and she ran out there to the gate and he said never mind honey never mind the children come here to daddy i want to take you in my arms i want to put my arms around you sweetheart and she said what happened what happened and he looks at her he says jesus came along jesus came along that's what made the difference wife he's come to me it was in my darkest hour the devil tormented me to no end and jesus came along a little gray-haired mother praying for her son was able to call jesus on the scene we got to be able to call jesus on the scene this morning mark 5 21. i don't even know what time i started so i don't know what time to quit mark 5 and jesus was passed over again by a ship until the other side much people gathered unto him and not unto the sea and behold he cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name and he saw him and he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little girl lies at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and so that she may live and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him so here we have this religious leader now jairus and his daughter went in on her deathbed and he goes and he finds see jesus and he seeks him out and he begins to tell him about his situation now i want you to notice that jared spoke in his faith that's what attracted jesus to his story he made a commitment to come and find him and fell down at his feet and said if you come and you lay your hands on my daughter i believe she will be made well so jesus says okay let's go let's do this and jesus is walking down there through the city they're making their way through the multitude and a woman comes up behind jesus and secretly touches the hem of his garment a touch of faith she touches him and jesus asked who touches me and his disciples says lord you see these crowd of people they're all touching you they're everywhere they're bumping into everybody everybody's touching he said no no no no it's not that kind of a touch this is a touch that pulled virtue from me this is a touch that has felt different because virtue has left me somebody is calling me onto the scene somebody has a need from me somebody is going to be what i'm going to be what they need me to be now put yourself in jairus place he has run to jesus to get a hold of him to bring him back to his daughter and now jesus suddenly stopped and jesus has stopped in the middle of this scene and his daughter is at death's door and he's probably thinking jesus come on hurry up please hurry up i need you to come as quick as possible she's at that store she's going to die any moment i'm going to lose my daughter and this woman has touched the hem of his garment and jesus stops to minister to her isn't it funny how we think we can control what what jesus does what god does and when he's going to do it and she's touching the hem of his garment and jerry's standing there thinking this isn't fair this isn't fair is life always fair no life's not fair but that's life and jesus is ministering here to this woman and jerius is thinking then this woman's been sick for 12 years she has lingered on for 12 years and my daughter is dying my 12 year old sweetheart is laying there dying i come to you first jesus come and heal my daughter you shouldn't even be attending to this woman she don't have a right to be here by the levitical law she should be stoned to death for having a blood issue and now jesus is ministering to her jesus is talking to her isn't that something how our minds work we need god more than anybody right our situation is greater than yours my need is greater than yours god come on the scene they can wait jesus has taken up all this precious time with the social outcast proven that he's no respecter of person he doesn't care about your background he doesn't care where you're from he doesn't care what what county you live in he doesn't care who your parents are he doesn't care if you're a royalty he doesn't care if you're a vagabond he cares about your soul and this woman came in contact with jesus in such a place that she laid her finger on his garments and said i need you on the scene years years she'd waited did jairus panic boy how about he was thinking some things but nope panic jesus is talking with this woman and while jesus is talking to this woman a messenger comes to jairus and says jairus i hate to tell you this but your daughter has died your daughter didn't make it we called the doctors the doctors came they tried everything they done everything they know to do but your daughter has died jesus is ministering to this lady and jesus hears the messenger talk to jairus about his daughter being dead and he turns to him and says don't be afraid only believe put yourself there you've just run a marathon to get to somebody that you think can lay his hands on your daughter and and make her well and now you've just been told by a messenger that she didn't make it she's gone she's not coming back she's dead as dead can be that's the reality of it and jesus looks at you and says don't be afraid only believe don't panic just act like you would if she wasn't dead boys as far as jesus was concerned death wasn't a challenge death is not a challenge to jesus death is not a child it's not an obstacle it's no different than sickness or blindness or deafness or cancer heart trouble it's no different than any of those things death is just a thing and he is in control and he knew that he has the power to restore her health and if he had the power to restore his he's got the power to raise but from the dead so jairus don't panic don't panic don't let that sudden unreasonable outpower fear come over you jesus is the messiah standing by jairus and he says trust me we have no factual evidence that she's going to be dead when we get there can you imagine walking back to that house can you imagine the road back to that house and jesus walking with you and said there's no reason to fear you see brother and sister when you're hand in hand with jesus there's no report bad enough that will change your situation god is in control when you're hand in hand with god you're in hand in hand with the master of the universe don't panic we have no evidence satan knows we'll go this direction for a minute satan knows that he can drive out your faith with fear you can have the most abundant amount of faith that you're ready to to to take on uh to cross a raging sea you can have enough faith to think you can walk on water but once jesus or once satan puts fear in you everything you think about jesus cost consistently goes down peter walk on the water and people get walk out on the water and he sees jesus he's got his eyes on jesus his faith is big it's strong and then all of a sudden the fear became to come on him and what did he do down down down listen what the prophet says here no matter how weak how sick how far in sin whatever the condition is he's there to make intercession upon what we confess that he has did for us and anything that was included in the atonement wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace upon him by his stripes were healed any of those things those attributes of his death if we take it in our heart and believe it to be truth and confess it that it that he has done it before we ever feel anything about it he's god to make it right to make intercession listen here i read this and when i read it i thought i know he just didn't say that listen to this next statement he says if i was paralyzed has anybody ever heard him say this if i was paralyzed and in my heart i believe he healed me i'd confess that i was healed if i couldn't move a muscle and i believed it if i confess that i was healed then according if i mean from my heart not just mentally but from my heart before god he's making intercession upon my confession he has to bring it to pass why was jesus telling paris not to be afraid only believe only believe the lord tells us too not to be afraid not to panic because when we panic negative situations begin to take place the negativity begins to come in and jesus he didn't deny the reality of the situation this was a real situation jerry jerris was his daughter was real but like i said she was really dead and jesus knew this and jesus you know he didn't look at jairus and say you know what if that woman hadn't stopped me i bet we'd have made it on time it must not be the will of god that your daughter be healed or she wouldn't stop me isn't that the way people try to do your walk with god i'm praying about this and i'm praying that god will lead me and guide me through this and then all of a sudden you're trying to tell you're trying to you want people to build your faith and i say well it just wasn't the will of god just wasn't for you you want to be a christian but look at your backslide it's just just not the will of god you must not be that seed you must not be that one you must not be predestinated jesus didn't look at him and say you know if it would have been his will i'd have been on the scene but i'm sorry it's too late it's too late darius i can't do nothing there's nothing i can do about it you had a lovely little girl but now she's gone that's not what he said that's not what he did he went straight into jairus house as if nothing had happened he went straight in there with a kind of faith doesn't panic he went right in there with the kind of faith that holds on to what he had he goes in there with that kind of faith and he operates the way he always does and the way he always will because god knows the outcome jesus starts fulfilling his promises and when jesus starts fulfilling the promises in your life and answers prayer you're going to be in a different kind of place he doesn't care that the storm rises he doesn't care that there's a red sea and pharaoh's behind you he doesn't care that the raging sea in your life is scaring you to death god does not concern with that god concerns with what he can do and as far as he's concerned he's going to continue in the direction to get you there if you need a miracle in your life he's going to continue to push you in the direction to receive a miracle don't let go of your faith your faith is what holds you and jesus listen he surrounded himself with faith he took peter james and john and they come into the house of the the synagogue ruler and they see this commotion and people's crying and wailing all around them and they're crying she's dead she's dead the girl's dead and jesus looks at him and says she's not dead she's asleep and they laughed at him are you a crazy man she's dead because we've already embalmed her the prophet said they emballed within an hour or so an hour or two of a person dying so that they could get them in the grave so that the stench didn't take over she's dead we've been are you crazy no she's not dead she's just asleep and all this commotion and all this laughter and all this doubt he pushed on the outside of the room that's right what did he take it's just like in the holies of holies he took in faith into that interior room he took faith in there where jairus's daughter was laying there asleep he took peter john and the mama and daddy who else is going to pray greater for you than my daddy and jesus walked over to her and he begins to get over to her and he looks at her he takes her by the hand and he says talitha which means little girl i say unto you get up talitha kumar little get up because you're gonna live regardless of the doubters regardless of those laughing regardless of what others said i said you're asleep so rise up and what did she do she got up and walked she made a confession that god had moved on the scene because somebody called god mary and martha can i do one more mary and martha they send word to jesus come quickly and quickly our brother's sick our brother's sick we don't know how long he can make it well four days later four days later after the tomb was sealed four days later after the embalming process four days later after the grieving process has started here comes jesus onto the scene and martha looks at him and says lord if you had been here i know my brother would not have died i know in my heart he wouldn't have died but what did she say next but i know that even now god you will give whatever you're asked of so she begins to look at him and jesus says martha martha answers and said i know he'll rise again in a resurrection because jesus said he's going to rise and jesus says i am the resurrection do you believe in me if you believe in me as the resurrection he can resurrect right now so they go in there and they begin to tell everybody and as they're going to the tomb here comes mary now and she's crying and she's wailing saying why didn't come jesus we called you and called you and called you i know you heard and jesus and his heart hurt jesus begins to seek pain and the anguish that these ladies have went through lazarus was his friend and jesus begins to see that lazarus meant so much to these and he begins to weep he walks up to the tomb and says remove the stone we can't do it it's been four days jesus it's been four days his nose has sunk in the worms are eating his flesh he stinks we can't unlock undo the tomb undo the tomb and as they roll the stone away he moves into the scene and he says lazarus fourth and the prophet said if he hadn't said it every resurrected saint would have come up out of the ground that is the power of god on the scene god moving on the sea come forward lazarus brothers and sisters if he can resurrect a physical body he can resurrect a broken marriage if he can resurrect a physical body he can resurrect your finances he can resurrect anything that the world says is dead the world may say it's there but in reality that's not the finality of it the ultimate thing is that god is in control and god jesus may have another plan for your family god may need to put you into a place that you have to go witness to somebody god needs people that will get out in shoe leather and witness to the people of what god has done in their life you may be dead right now but when jesus is on the scene let me tell you something keep people with faith authority you keep the peter and john the james all those naysayers all those doubters they'll come to you like flies they'll come to you like flies on death why because that's their job is to discourage you to put you in a different direction surround yourself with faith surround yourself with god let's stand to our feet amen amen there's nothing impossible with the master of the wind you may get a little sidetracked in your journey things may not always seem like they want them to be you may not always think that things are going to work out to your benefit or to your goodness or to the way you want things to work but remember just to call god on the scene god takes the impossible and makes it possible god takes death and turns it into life god takes a an uncrossable sea and brings down a highway god's mindful of every one of his children is that you i don't know what you're going through but i know this was strong on my heart and i know it's been leading up to it for for a week and a half two weeks of words that's been said by our pastor in the past week songs that's been saying so i don't know what it is that somebody's needing today but i feel like there truly is somebody here this was for it was for me i feel like i need to know more about god and being able to place god on the scene being call him into a place to where he meets our need you know when we realize who we are you know what the prophet said we're an invincible army and that's a powerful statement i want god to be able to use me and depend upon me to be a witness for somebody in this life brothers and sisters i didn't have this on my notes and being a witness for some of our life this church ought to be full you know there's people are so lost in sin people are so wretched in the way they live they hate the way they live but they don't know what the answer is we have to be a witness to somebody we have to be able to answer to somebody god sure is good to us you know what let's just pray heavenly father we're thankful lord jesus for the service today lord for what you've laid on my heart lord lord you know i'm no speaker and i just try to put down notes and thoughts and research and find things that that you place on my heart and lord i'm always astonished of the things that that come out lord and and how things are brought out lord i just trust that this was an encouragement to somebody i trust lord that this was a challenged body somebody who's maybe going through something in their life lord that they've never had to face maybe they haven't told a soul about it but inside their heart they're struggling they're hurting they're in pain maybe they just feel like they're not where they need to be lord but lord i just pray this morning that they would find themselves in a place where the children of israel did at that red sea when there was a mountain on one side pharaoh behind them a sea all around them on the other side and then you moved in on the scene and you've parted the sea i pray lord that you'll part the sea in their life lord jesus that they will be able to walk across and find the faith and the belief in the hope and the deliverance that they have need of this morning lord jesus would know that you're more than able if you could take the hands of a dead child and before the hearts of her mother and father speak to her lord to rise up what could you do in our life what could you do in our life even though sometimes the storms of life seem like they're raging and we're being tossed up and down we know lord that you're more than able to deliver us we know that you're more than able to move on to the scene that you're more than able to speak to the winds and calm the storm and put your arms around us as you did that maniac and deliver him so that he could go and put his arms around his children and his wife as a restored man of god lord we love you with all of our
