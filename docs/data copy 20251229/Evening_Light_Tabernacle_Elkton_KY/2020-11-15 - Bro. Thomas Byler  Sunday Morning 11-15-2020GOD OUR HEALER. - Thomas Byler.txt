and sister Parish amen get to see him this morning been what be here praise the lord it's better to be here than it is to be somewhere else because I kind of had to argue with the devil this morning and get ready to come and I've been wanting to come back and see you good people for quite a while but being my age I was kind of afraid to get out out there in this uh world today that you know it's it's really in bad shape yes it is you know I believe we were we were looking at the day how many have remember brother Billy Paul asking brother brandham said what Dad tell me what's end's going to be and he spoke back and said son I can't tell you because you'd worry yourself to death now Billy Paul and I were close friends and we he come to my shop and I lived in Jeffersonville a long time when they was in while he'd go up there and and Ro us for a while but you know this message we all need to get really in this message and get in the word of God now then how many in here knows how to get closer to God Amen brother bam said pray and study yeah that he get you close and I believe that that's what I've been doing praying and studying and also to go to church a little bit I've got ever I've got 1,200 messages of brother Brown I'm on my computer you know what I do every day listen to some of those messages and I believe this is the way the truth and the life and I believe we got a man here that's is way than the truth and the life and I pray for him I said God give him a message that we need to hear it may be rough but I like I'm rough do you like I'm rough I do I wanted to get down and hit me amen and straighten me out praise God [Applause] all right come on Amen we always like to hear from our family amen from far off amen so it's always good to hear so God bless you brother Steve good to have you and your family with us this weekend Amen brother yes God bless God bless you well God bless you Saints it's one of the things I do not like about visiting churches because I've always get put on the spot not that I'm a preacher or anything but for some reason I think uh God God has a sense of humor right just about everywhere I go be I I go to Mexico sometimes and and uh I get put on the spot so this morning I I knew I was going to be put on the spot so I did have a little something uh for you guys I do not want to take our brother's time um you know brother brand said um no service is complete without the word of God so I was thinking if you don't mind I read you a scripture so yeah the scripture I was thinking about this morning was in um the first book of John and the scripture says in the first book of John chapter 1 verse 7 it says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin isn't that a precious scripture and you know today um so many people are are in church today just like we are but you know they're serving a bloodless religion you realize that they really are I'm not saying anything against those those folks they're wonderful people a lot of those people are are better people than we are even but they're got a bloodless religion because the denominational system has taken the blood out of this Bible and so they're giving the people they're giving their people a hybrid food but we're so thankful today that we had uh we had a a messenger who brought us food but it was not only food for his season when he was alive but you remember there's a storehouse and the Lord told them uh to to put that food in there because there was a time coming and so it is today it is today and uh you know I was thinking uh for me for well for us but especially for me uh we always take things for granted and uh I want to bring your greetings from uh from from our congregation brother bisco's church and um one time I went somewhere and they didn't give me greetings to give the people but I greeted the people anyway so when I came back I spoke to a brother a minister brother and I said well I didn't have greetings for the people I said but I gave the greetings anyway as if they had given me greetings and he said that's the way it is so the so I give you I I bring you greetings from the congregation in Canada because I'm sure if I said will you send your greetings to them they would say absolutely 100% uh so we we love your church over there we have heard about you we have heard about you and we have heard good things um you know I was thinking um uh we're staying with Brother John and sister Alicia and we have been we we felt so welcome being in their home we we really appreciate um you know their family and brother B said that the congregation is a is the reflection of the pastor let's just others do it and then he also said you know you can't you can't live higher than your pastor so those are those are things that are that are set in stone right and anyway we was out uh the other day we went to see uh they have the little boy Jonathan with him and um I was we went to see his uh Grandpa and his grandma who lived I don't know an hour away or something like that um and anyway Gary that's right and sister Marlene so when we were over there um uh I've learned this I've actually learned this from my pastor years and years ago he really likes to watch your children and so when we were there I was I was watching I was really observing Jonathan and it came to me uh really clear why the Lord said we have to be like little children because I I had I I kind of knew that already but I had wondered why is it that the Lord would take a little child and and say unless you're like these little children you're not going to enter there and you know when we got there he was happy to see Grandpa and Grandma but all of a sudden they had a gift for him and let me tell you as soon as they that he got a hold of that little gift and then they told him there was another one coming that's what spoke to me because when he heard there was another gift coming he didn't care who was there he didn't care about the food he didn't want to eat he he was just he was talking he was saying I got another gift coming and I got one more coming they're gonna give me one more well you know when I came this morning to to the church here I was thinking well if I got to be like a child like the Lord said but then I got to be expecting what gift is he going to give me today so I I've come this morning expecting that God is going to speak to me through his gift because I have needs in my life just like we all do you know I I have needs in my life that you know I'm looking for God to to answer me some prayers looking for God to move in some situations in our lives but I do believe that God can speak through the gift this morning and he can answer that so that's the gift I'm looking for just like Jonathan he was excited you should have seen him he just kept saying there's another gift coming this afternoon before you guys get here they're going to give me another gift and when we ask them Hey where's your little gift I mean he rushed to get it he was like right here this is what they gave me right now well I'm looking forward to the same I want to be like I want to be like a little child in that way that I want to be an expectation for what God is going to give to me I will make I I'll make an uh one uh another comment real quick before I go sit down um you know I was saying we take things for granted and I had always had I didn't know how it was going to take place but had I had always wanted to come to Kentucky and the reason being is because uh Kentucky I was telling I was telling somebody might have been my wife I said kentucki has a real uh special place I believe in the United States now and I tell you why this is this is my thing okay so when you talk about the Civil War that's a there's a lot of history here behind that Lots but then you have of course Abraham Lincoln who was from the land here but then as if that was not enough we have uh the prophet of God who who came from these lands so you think about the special place this place must have had in God's heart because he gave he gave this place Abraham Lincoln and then he gave this place uh the prophet of God who was born in in the area here somewhere around here so that's super special to me and then brother Brandon one time I remember when he talked I'm just going to paraphrase I don't have the quote with me but he brother Brandon was talking about uh when God spoke to him and go well God was speaking to David and he said I I given you a place with the Great of the earth and then brother Brandon was in that moment you can hear in the tape he gets overcome by emotion because then all of a sudden he can see and God said the same thing to him and then he said look at my paast he said look at look at where I come from and he start he started speaking about his childhood and all of that but then when he's when when he's done talking about that he said now look at me today he said I have to hide from people he said I have to hide he said because there's so many people that want to see me in the hi him right there that God had given them a place amongst the Great Men of the earth and it never hit me it never hit me until until today what was he talking about you know and I was thinking who was Abraham Lincoln right like you know if I go somewhere if I go somewhere I hope he doesn't hear this if I go somewhere all I have to say is I'm Andrew rias's dad and people say oh oh okay because I that I had that happen to me left o over and over I met some people from South America like P um way out there in the middle of nowhere and when I introduced myself they were going no okay I told them I said oh I said my son is Andrew Ras he sings at the church and they're like oh and anyway they knew who I was you know I was thinking about you you people you know all you have to say is you're from Kentucky and or you know the Land of Lincoln right and let me tell you the whole world would know where you come from right that's that's the way it is so anyway I'm really glad that I'm associated with the Lord Jesus Christ and really thankful and happy that we're here this morning you know outside of Washington State uh we have never been to another Message Church never have in the United States this is this is our first church in Washington state we've been to another church that is kind of a upshoot of our church in Seattle but outside of that we never have so we're really we're really blessed to be here truly and um when I went to sit down over there I told my wife I said well give me some of those clinics I was really glad those clinics were there because I knew I was going to need them and uh and I did I did I was over there balling uh we had this uh I need to get I need to give you we had this little incident at the airport the other day and on our way here my wife was just crying a lot and I was like why am I crying you know I'm I got I guess I got nerves to Ste well this morning it was my turn okay God bless you it's been it's so good to be here God bless you all right so well thought we might have to adjust for you but should give you a two hour 520 there two hours ear [Music] all right [Music] [Music] you okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen God is good let's give the Lord a hand say thank you Lord Jesus bless your name Lord we bless your name Lord Glory thank you Lord Jesus good to see you Sister Lisa amen glad you blessed us with your presence this morning so it's just good to see you and your children here this morning Amen brother Iran brother Tommy back there and y'all from over in scotsville yall had a pretty good headwind this morning didn't you that was some strong winds amen we had so but anyway so all right one more Right Way D Wayne thank you I speak up it doesn't Echo too far good to have Dwayne with us amen so how many can talk Amish in here Lin Martha John Moy there's quite a few of us here can talk the language so you're pretty much at home this morning praise the Lord I probably won't preach in Dutch but we'll preach in English we we could a little I've heard so much of it when I was young I can still repeat a large portion of it amen but anyway way so we just uh greet you in the name of the Lord and amen and welcome everybody this morning amen and so we are certainly praying that the Lord will just continue to watch over us remember this coming Wednesday now everybody can possibly make it amen there'll be brother Ted padle we're gonna have a good preacher Wednesday night amen how many enjoys this ministry brother Ted badley from Arizona is going to be with us Wednesday night and then brother Paul Hart next Sunday Amen brother Paul Hart will be with us next Sunday so remember him he's from Indiana amen from Brother DWI so we just pray that for that the Lord will bless him also amen we've been speaking on basically the attributes of God God and His attributes and who he is and what he is amen uh we've been touching a little bit on the just this morning we want to touch a little bit on the seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah amen the seven different redemp names one of his Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah RI and many different ones that he has and so we've been basically the thought the direction that we've been going is speaking on God Amen and what he is and what he does for us amen because he's certainly one that is worth bragging about isn't he amen I believe the prophet of God one time amen was uh confronted by a woman who said you know you just brag on Jesus too much you know your only your fault the fault that you have is that you brag on Jesus too much and he says well thank you very much I'm very appreciate of that that's a wonderful fault to have amen is to brag about Jesus too much because there's not a whole lot in this world that we can brag about but the one thing we can do is Brag perhaps or just a prophit or something you know amen and that he wasn't Divine and so forth because of uh uh you know the fact that he cried and so he says I'll prove to you by your Bible that Jesus was just a man and and so forth and he says well I don't really believe that but if you can prove it she says well I believe in scripture says that Jesus wept wept like a man he says lady that is thinner than the broth of a chicken no that is thinner than the broth of a the shadow of a chicken that was starved to death now no it wasn't a chicken you might get a little broth out it but the shadow of a chicken you you don't get nothing out of the shadow of a chicken amen that was starve to death he says yes that's right lady he was a man when he cried and when he up over Jerusalem but he was a certainly more than a man when he told Lazarus come forth and the man came out of the Grave he was more than a man there you know in many places he was more than a man and so amen the Bible talks about how that God is all and he is in all amen how many believes that nothing's out of cater God knew exactly this world would be IND the condition condition that it's in amen and so it's moving forward right along right according to his program this morning uh amen I believe Wednesday night we talked about God is our deliverer amen amen and we took David and Goliath when he faced Goliath and so forth and and when he talked to Saul when when David come before Saul uh he told Saul he says you know I slew a i s i slew a lion I slew a bear he says and God will deliver this uncircumcised Philistine into my hand also amen and but he made sure to make help him to understand that it wasn't David that was the great man it was God that was going to do to delivering amen and when he talked to uh Goliath himself amen and the prophets were made about how that uh Goliath told David that he would feed his flesh to the foul in the air and so forth and what he would do and and pick him up perhaps with his Spear and whatnot and then David come he says you come to me with a sword and a shield but I come to you in the name of the Lord today I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going to feed you and the residue of the Philistines to the fouls of the air to the beasts of the field because this day God will deliver you into my hand I like that don't you he put the right emphasis on the fact that it was God that does it and that's what it's all about folks it's what God does Amen so we're wonderful we're so grateful what God has done in this generation amen because I'll tell you now I when I was uh uh left left a menites I was on my own about 16 years old when I went out there and be a masonary job and went out there in the world and and just lived however I want to did everything that I could and some things that I couldn't and found out that there's no real pleasure out there in the world Amen and begin to search and find out find out what what is Truth where is is the truth where do I go what do I believe and begin to testing different churches begin to testing different people and find you know that uh find out that each one has their own set of rules they all have a different way of seeing it then I was introduced to the prophet of God in this generation I TR to tell you one thing right now God has come down in this generation and he has proved himself alive and real unlike in any other time and age I believe with all my heart and he kept those tapes in store so that you could listen those tapes amen you could feed on the word of God and you can know that Jus Christ is alive he's the only way he's the only life he's the only truth there is no other way other than him anden I'm glad for God's grace this morning so this morning I want to talk to you not about God our deliverer but I want to talk to you about God being our healer amen amen god Jehovah REI amen amen Jehovah rifa amen God our healer so if you will with stand with me this morning we'll get into the word of God and let's just bow our heads this morning before we open the word just talk to the author this morning Lord Jesus we come before you Lord Jesus thankful God that we can have the right Lord Jesus by the blood of Jesus Christ to approach your throne of grace this morning and we desire father that you would just help me Lord to get out of the way Lord we know that you gave the church five five gifts Lord the fivefold ministry of that's in the church God and Lord you have placed a gift I believe truly in my heart father and if I can just get myself out of the way Lord then you can use that gift to speak to your people the things that that you want to say father if I was to not get out of the way Lord then I might say things that are damaging things that you don't want said Lord and mess it all up but father so I ask God that you just help me as I surrender to you Lord this morning have your way in the service Lord we thank you Lord Jesus for every face that we see we know that God the people love you Lord Jesus and they love to come into the house of God to worship you in spirit and in truth and Lord we truly believe that we're living in the end time God when it's fixing to be all over with Lord and we going to come to disguise to meet you in the air and Lord we're here to prepare ourselves we're here to be ready for that time father for you we know that the Great Tribulation lays just beyond the Rapture father and those that are left out there will be there'll be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth and Lord we have no intentions to be here at that time father and so we feel in our hearts God there's something pulling us something causing us to come subject to the word Lord a Earnest of our Redemption Lord is taking place in every heart father we're all searching ourselves asking ourselves if we're in the faith or not asking ourselves if we are in the place that we should be or not Lord and how if we are not that how that we can get ready and how that we can make things right and do things that's right Lord Jesus we just ask God that Lord I feel you've played this upon my heart to speak we ask God your blessing upon it now in Jesus Christ's name bless your word this morning amen and amen turn to Malachi 4 amen first Malachi 4 verse one for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud Y and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts and it shall leave them neither root nor Branch how many beli there's a fire coming Peter said the heavens shall be on fire and the elements shall melt with fervent heat all all the things of the Earth are going to be burnt up in that day remember the day cometh the day of the Lord cometh at the thief in the night in wherein the heavens will be on fire and so forth it's going to be the day it's going to God's going to have his day man has his day now to do what they want to and however they want to but God's going to have his day but I like this notice it'll leave them neither brute nor Branch but it talks about a different category of people here don't it IT addresses another group there's going to be a group but unto you hey amen can you put your name there this morning but unto you that fear or reverence my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked and they shall be ashes Under The Souls of the your feet in the the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb and in all Israel with the statutes and judgments now notice now here's a prophecy for our day behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord how many knows there has got to be a Prophet come on the scene be before it burns up and we've had that prophet he has done come and he has unone the next thing that's left is the fire amen and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers least I come and smite the Earth with a curse may God add His blessings to the reading a word you can be seated this morning so this morning with the help of the Lord I want to deal perhaps with the healing of almighty God first of all when we talk about God and when we talk about his being a deliverer and let me just uh perhaps if I could I I'm going to just read you the seven compound Redemptive names of God and what it means and of course you know we could take a sermon on each one of these and we won't but we want to deal with the the second one Jehovah Raa amen now notice Jehovah Gyra means that the Lord will provide amen how many that God is the provider the Bible says that there was not anything that was made that was nothing was made but what he made amen so whatever amen God is made he provides all for us we won't go down there too far but he's our provider the next is I am the Lord that Health thee amen I am the Lord that Health thee and that's what we want to dwell on this morning uh Jehovah nassi the Lord is my banner je Jehovah Shalom he says uh the Lord is peace amen the Lord is peace peace the Lord's peace and R O the Lord is my shepherd amen how many know that he is truly The Shepherd of the Sheep amen and I want you to remember that all of these things were in God before he ever even created the world and we know he could never express being a shepherd He could never express being a savior he could never express being a redeemer he could never express being a war unless he allowed the world to get into the condition that it is amen and you and I are receiving and and and being edified and receiving the blessings of what the essence of almighty God really is amen now we know that the prophet taught us that we are living way below our god-given privileges isn't that right amen and also he says you know that every promise in the Bible when you have become a Son of God when you receive the baptism of the Holy ghost every promise is yours whatsoever you desire whatsoever you think ask you ask you shall receive ask and you shall receive how many believe that and so we have the we have the the checkbook so to speak we have the authority amen that is all belongs to us but there was a reason that our prophets that the church and the people are living way down below what they should be living and that's what we're going to kind of focus on this morning would that be okay because I truly believe that as we get closer to the Rapture and I don't know about you but I'll tell you what every day it's just something I don't know what it is I'm not here to say may say yay or n but I'm telling you right now there's something down in my soul I'm I'm feeling something fixing to happen how I don't know about you but I can just sense there's something fixing to happen it's right at the threshold now not everybody has that fear not everybody has that reverence not everybody has that feeling but I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ amen that the people of God are going to have it in their soul they're going to sense something that there's danger really close amen and that danger is that you would miss the Rapture that you would not go into translation and that you would have to be left here in the Great Tribulation period and we see America is certainly ripe for Uprising they are ripe for all kinds of Chaos the world is ripe for chaos they're on the verge of chaos the whole world get ready for it but just something I don't know what it is but I just feel like it's time for the bride to get ready and I feel the Lord at least in my life and I trust it's in your life that he's working something he's doing something there's a pool that's going on that's pulling it to him saying there's a pull going on if you are his remember this if I lifted I will draw all men unto myself and especially his people are going to be pulled am me towards God and away from this world Amen the velcro the velcro of the world that we're velcro to is coming loose and the velro in our lives that ties us to God is coming together amen and it's tied and feeling it closer and closer how many's with me this morning you feel that pull amen and I believe that this is the this is what God is doing I don't know what he's doing in any your other churches I don't know but a lot of times you go online and a lot of times you'll see and you'll hear amen ministers going in the same direction saying the same thing I don't know but I believe that that's the way the Holy Spirit Works amen that he's getting his church ready to leave this world I truly believe that I didn't finish amen and then there's the U after the shepherd is I can't pronounce it TS i d n u all right and it means the Lord is our righteousness and the last one is Jehovah sh the Lord is there how many believe that I will never leave you nor forsake you even until the end of the world I am going to be there how many believes he's here how many believes our meeting is in vain if the Lord Jesus Christ isn't here if the Holy Spirit isn't here then we are meeting in vain amen me and my wife is driving out here coming to church we passed the Baptist Church over there and they were walking in there and I said honey they are walking into a morg now how many knows that's what the prophet of God called the morgs call them lodes he said they're dead that's where dead people go they don't have a real Ministry they don't they don't they don't call Sin out they don't have the blood there as our brother was saying the blood's not there it's a bloodless religion it's a dead religion where the Holy Ghost isn't it's dead amen there's churches that been dead for hundreds of years and they don't know it amen but I'm thankful to God I'm that he's still in his people yes in his church wherever that is whoever that is hey you could be in this church don't mean you're alive you could be dead sitting there it all depends on if you got Christ in it the Bible says he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son hath not life amen praise the Lord so we look at that and we see this that it's truly the Lord it is truly the Lord that does healing now we know that uh down through different times and all the way back into Israel's time that how that that you know Jesus would heal the sick and he would raise the dead and he would all do all these things and they says you know you cast The Devil out by by Beba and Jesus said that don't make sense he says not if the devil cast out the devil his Kingdom's divided and it would fall no Devils can't cast out Devils that's not how it works no and listen and people want to try to say that the devil can heal let me me tell you something the devil can't heal anything God the devil he doesn't have the ability to heal how many times have you had a cut amen and all those uh cells and different things you know amen the cells the brother B says you know that when you have a cut amen and perhaps you get little puss going there he says those that puss is a bunch of little soldiers that have given their life fighting that bad germ to save your life you don't see a a cancer how many know cancer perhaps you have a cancer or something amen and those cancer cells they don't fight each other they build and build to destroy you to take your life because that devil doesn't come but to kill and to steal and to destroy that's all the Devil comes to do but God comes to heal it's the good cells that fight the bad cells not fight bad cells fighting bad cells it doesn't happen that way amen so now let me I want to ask you I want to be again uh with with something that caught my attention when I was listening to this and when made this statement how many in here and I want to ask you a question you can raise your hand in a minute but this is kind of a test for all of us now how many Know believe that there's actually Divine Healing Divine Healing how many can say this morning that you have absolutely been miraculously healed by Divine Healing Divine Healing now I want to read you something else brother bam says all healing comes from God all all healing is Divine Healing now how many has had Divine Healing huh folk if you got sick and you got well you experience Divine Healing all healing comes from God why the scripture says um let me see here Psalms 1033 says I am the Lord who heals all thy diseases so oh my when I think about this and how that God is the he is the one that does all the healing there's no healing but what comes from God every time you have a cut every time you have a bruis whenever that gets better praise be to God you ought to thank God say thank than you Jesus every time you have a headache and that headache goes away that's Divine Healing every time you have a back haake and that back that's healed praise be to God I have been divinely healed hello how many pleas all healing and all healing that says is divine because it comes from God Amen I thought about brother Parish amen of how you're what 90 92 92 92 in May you H how many times this man has had to experience Divine Healing to get to 92 almost 91 isin't that right Divine Healing to think to get that far you have got to experience Divine Healing every time you get sick and you get a fever and I'll tell you what if it wasn't for the grace of God you would die you would never get any better but it's Divine Healing it's God that comes and heals you it is him that touches you and sometimes we just take that for granted we don't realize that it's almighty God that does it brother Steve I thought about you that and he's getting better isn't it wouldn't it be terrible if it got worse and worse and worse you'd have to get in a wheelchair but God it is Divine Healing that heals it all the doctors can do is sew it up or give you medicine but it's God that does the healing amen it's absolutely God that does the healing amen it has to be God praise the Lord and you know I don't want to talk to you about just natural healing but I want to talk to you about spiritual healing we know that through Malachi 4 the prophet in this generation we've got the books back there and it has all the records of how that there would be in Africa ain't that right how many truckloads semi TR loads of Cs and stretchers ain't that right seven or 11 I forget the number of truckloads of cuts and stretchers and sticks where people had to have to prob get and that all those C and stretches loads of them where the Lord come down and just healed the whole congregation heal all of those people there was healing mass healing that took place in our generation unlike the time of Christ way more than Christ because he said more Works shall shall you do because I go unto the father greater than this shall you do more shall you do isin't that right and through this generation God came down when he came when that son came with righteousness with healing in his wings he took and healed the people is that right and people would flock from everywhere to get healed they would come from everywhere to get healed but when he came and he says denominational churches is absolutely The Mark of the Beast Boy that's when people left him oh no we can't handle that but yet God stayed with him God still kept proving that he was the truth it's absolutely according to the word of God Amen the Bible says that that white woman was a mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her people claim to be married to Christ and live any any old way doing anything they want to nothing but adulterers spiritual adulterers dress anyway think anyway live there all no that's not Christ that's what it consists of out there but think about it came to for the healing and now listen how many know that natural healing is a minor amen you might be healed but think about every one of those in that generation for the most part are probably dead right now all gone unless they were just a child perhaps in the 1965 some of those could still be here but most of them were children barely even remember it but most of those people that got their healing amen that they have had to pass away but now how many know that you can't never major on a minor but the major healing that takes place the thing that he is really interested in is your [Music] soul that's the thing that needs healing now I want to go to another scripture if you would let's go over to the Book of Numbers Book of Numbers 21 and we'll begin with verse five and go through nine and then I'll turn to St John 3:14 and 15 and his people spake against God and against Moses remember this is when they were going through the Wilderness and against Moses wherefore or have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loathes this light bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people now how many know he could have chose frogs to bite them he could have chose anything to bite them but he chose serpents to bite him amen and the example here is that when you go to complaining against God remember you're getting snake bit death sits in on you when you get to complaining about what God is doing and about God's program amen God isn't pleased with it at all he sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against the pray unto the Lord and he he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he lookth upon it shall live amen that's where the song comes look and live look and live amen look to Jesus Christ and live simply by looking at it and believing now I'm they had to believe but they made a serpent and now notice and Moses made a serpent of brass now how many knows that brass represents judgment yeah that's right he made a brass serpent in other words this serpent that had bit him they put him up on a pole right amen this serpent it represents this serpent having been judged right amen and put up on a pole now how many knows that Jesus became sinful for us is that right Jesus became sin for us amen and he was lifted up on the pole amen and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if the serpent had bitten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass that he lived over in St John 3 St John 3 and this is not just something I come up with or think about but this is what the scripture says and how many believes that's more important than anything St John 3 and verse4 now notice he says and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son be lifted up amen that whosoever believeth in him right looks upon Him should not perish but have eternal life amen so for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not have perished but have everlasting life W praise the Lord think about if you can absolutely without question believe that scripture you can change your destination from going to hell to going to heaven whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life now I don't know about you but that's what I believe that changed me that's what I believe that got me the holy ghost that Jesus Christ is the Son of God that he was lifted up for me that he paid the price for my sins how many believes he paid the price he was the one that was lifted up he was judged by almighty God the wrath of almighty God come down upon Jesus on the cross and he paid for the sins of the whole world just like that fiery serpent he was a representation put that serpent at everybody that's been spit by the serpent I don't know about you but that serpent in the Garden of Eden how many knows we've all been bitten by that serpent amen that bite represents the bite of sin bitten by amen and you were going to die how many know you going to die amen because we have all been affected by the bite of The Serpent and we was going to die but he put up a pole amen it's not that serpent anymore but it's Christ that we look to because there's not any salvation in any other there's not a Salvation in this church or any other Church there is only salvation in Jesus Christ nowhere else not ever praise be to God oh Hallelujah think about that oh my so now notice here bam says as Jesus said as Moses lift up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son be lifted up now the same reason in the compound reason he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed oh they were murmured against God and against Moses and were bitten by serpents amen and the serpent tooken the care of a two-fold application TW twofold the first was to forgive their sins and to heal their sickness amen how many believes it was a twofold reason that he was lifted up one to take away the sin that we have and the other one was for our healing both natural I'll tell you right now that we have just as R right to the Holy Ghost to forgiveness and the healing of our soul as we do to the Natural part the healing of our bodies amen God was going to make a way for us Isaiah 4522 says we find God says look unto me all ye ends of the Earth amen now when the Earth has come to its end of its systems when that all comes hand let the people begin to look at him how many believes it's time to begin to look up for our Redemption Draw N time to focus our thoughts and our minds Amen on above not on the things below praise be to God Amen so praise be to God God is good isn't he so we know that God has to take away first of all we realize that whether it's spiritual or whether it's natural healing it all comes from God Amen and God was going to make God was going to make a remedy amen God was going to come up with a cure and today in today's world they're trying their best to come up with a cure they're coming up with a medicine they're kind of come up with something amen for this covid-19 and I'm not right they're calling it warp speed right they're looking for something at warp speed to try to take care of this covid-19 a sickness that they don't really know what to do with they claim they got it perhaps now and so forth but listen it was at warp feet they're trying to come up with something and can you imagine all the different things they tried all the things they tested and so forth and just like penicil how many knows when they come up with Penicillin amen they took care it was something that would kill bad bacteria amen and they found this they found it and they had to use this and they had to try that Amen to try to come up to find something that would counteract that and that's exactly what God did for you and me amen looking for a cure looking for something that will take care of your problem amen and then you know a lot of times you'll take uh before they try it on human trials who they try it on first a guinea pig or some kind of animal they'll try on animal see it works on them before they try humans and know and then when it works on the perhaps then they'll get a very brave human being to step in ain't that right and say all right who's brave enough to try this out somebody will volunteer you know perhaps they'll be famous or something and they'll try it on humans and they'll find out how many know that there certain things and the doctor when you go to the doctor's office he said now are you allergic to penicillin are you allergic to Tylenol are you allergic to aspirin or are you allergic to does this not work for because not all of these things that they come up with work for everybody they might work on some and it might want work on anothers but now how many knows the Salvation plan it works for everybody that comes to him and is willing to take this medicine you know how much of a tacle they have about people saying I'm not taking it I'm not taking it if Trump comes up with it I ain't taking it hey now that somebody else is in they'll probably take shots spot a dozen uh but listen you know it's all all all of that you know but think about it they have to come up with something that works something that is safe everybody wants something that's safe and that's what God did amen and we know that Jesus Christ so to speak amen he was the true test subject Christ was the subject of whether we had a toxin whether we had a medicine amen that would work now how many know the Bible said that Jesus Jesus Christ was tempted in every place in every way Jesus Christ was tempted like the Temptation that comes upon every one of us yet without sin that's right he was yet without sin he came to that place it didn't matter whenever the devil tempted him on the mountain says you know you're starved you haven't eaten for 40 days amen turn these stones into bread oh he was a hunger remember that that they left him but he got hungry and what did he do he tested him the devil got Eve he got Moses he got David he got all of these other brothers he got them to fall but when he come to this one and he tried to get him to fall he found out that it wasn't so easy no that's the prophet God said he had a he grabbed a hole of a 10,000 watt wire he got his feather singed amen Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God Amen another place he says Just Fall Down and Worship me and you can have all the kingdoms of the world offered all the kingdoms of the world he offered them Amica he offered them Russia you offer them China you offer them North Korea you offer them all the kingdoms you can have all these kingdoms you can be the ruler of all of them in other words Satan offered Jesus to be his right-and man the only thing you have to do is to Fall Down and Worship me that's all devil wanted him to do he offered him all these things amen and he got another says Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve no thank you how many knows when you rebuke the devil he'll flee from you he'll flee from you if you rebuke him amen he was tempted in all these different places he was tempted amen with women he was tempted with lust he was tempted with uh money he was tempted with popularity huh but he made himself of no reputation and became and took on the form of a serpent servant not serpent amen so how many believes that no matter what it was he passed every test when he comes down to one of the hardest tests from what I understand was in The Garden of Gethsemane when he knew that his hour was come say it was the hardest battle that he could ever face was having to go through being be spit on false accuse going to Calvary and suffering death itself going to death itself he was a human being he was a man he had these things here that he had to battle with and he had to pray to be able to have the strength to go through it at one place he was so strong and so powerful until he says father if it be possible huh almost a word that you wouldn't think Jesus would say but yet he said it he says father if it's possible let this cup pass from me if there's any way that I don't have to do this huh that was the fight the fight was between his will and the will of God how many knows that's going to be every one of our biggest fight between what you want to do your will and what God wants you to do this flesh pulls you one way it doesn't want to do it but the Holy Spirit pulls you another amen and uh Jesus was Victorious right after that he says nevertheless not my will but thy will be done how many believes every True Believer you come down to that test I don't care how forsaken you seem to be how bad things get if you after you become a Christian and then you get down to where the Prophet God did when God took his wife took his child because he didn't go preach when he was supposed to devil whispered in his ear he says you know there is a God couldn't tell him there was no God but he don't love you huh if he loved you he would raise your wife up he would save your child your little Sharon Rose little bitty girl amen he would he would be merciful he's not merciful and the devil almost told him he says if that that's how God going to be huh if that's how God's going to be but he never let the words come out he says the Lord gave the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord later on his doctor said but man did you did you hold your religion let me ask you something you're a Christian I've been a Christian since I'm 20 years old 58 now can you say well did you hold your religion huh no I didn't hold my religion My Religion held me how many believe when you're truly Born Again of the spirit of God your religion will held you he holds you no man can pluck him out of my hand all that come to me I will lose how many not he's not going to lose any that come to him boy that ought to make us happy that are saved if you believe you're saved amen and you know that you're God remember there ain't nothing going to be able to pluck you out of his hand not tribulation not distress not Peril not lay out of sea not lukewarmness not riches not the cares of this world nothing's going to be able to do it amen praise be to to God oh my what we need today is a healing of the Soul amen you know natural we appreciate God very very much every time you get sick and every time you go and I'm gonna have to make it a habit of having more testimonies but every time you get better we ought to have a testimony meeting amen and you ought to be able to say Better B to church yeah I just want to thank God because I feel better brother Stevenson back there huh how manyan know he was divinely healed of Co diagnos him of covid-19 sister Johnny's here are you thankful sister are you feeling good I feel great amen hey we ain't having enough funeral today by God's grace is that right it's because of Divine Healing it's because he is the one that heals us he's the one that gives you he's my strength Giver he's lifter up of my soul amen every time you get down he's the one that picks you up he's the one encourages you when you're down low amen how many think for a god like that he knew that the whole world would need healing how many knows that why do you think there just before he said for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he says as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so I'm going to be lifted up everybody that looks to me can live you don't have to die just look to me look to the church no look to that church no look to Jesus Christ that's the only place you'll ever get salvation look to me unto me all you and be what healed we get our spiritual healing because we were sick we were sick unto death amen spiritually speaking we had no soul we had no Spirit we had no salvation we couldn't lift ourselves up amen we needed uh God to raise us up to Quicken that se that's down on the inside of us praise be to God how many glad that there's a serum amen God has a serum he has a medicine that we can take brother preached on that many times he preached on why amen Jer Jeremiah 8 verse 22 is there no bomb in Gilead G Gilead is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there why then is the health of the daughter of my people not recovered amen now Propet God said back in his day that the bride of Christ the PE Church of God was the sickest body that he knew of that she was living way below her god-given Privileges and so forth how many believes that today we've had the message now we've had God's message Vindicated proven message for 20 30 40 50 years now I'm many believes this morning that we should be healed how many would say this morning with me we should be recovered in other words we should be better we should have recovered from sickness we should have recovered from lukewarmness we should have recovered from a bad attitude from bad spirits from think that we ought to be we ought to be over there we should be healed we should be happy we should be like a little child thank be to God for his healing touch huh that's right we ought to be the happiest people people on the face of the Earth amen so my question is are you healed this morning are you recovered because God certainly has given us the remedy he's given the whole world the remedy isn't it in our politics today and talking about how that we need healing the nation needs healing now I may ask you this do you really think they're going to find the right way to get healing they could if they wanted to but they're not to accept that way are they now they're going to accept some substitute or some other way to try to get everybody to be healed there's only one way that we could ever be healed and that is through Jesus Christ the Lord no other way only through the Holy Ghost could there be ever any recovery any healing you take you take two people that have odds with each other have a spat with each other have differences with each other how many know they won't never get healed outside of forgiveness they'll never get healed outside of the grace of almighty God Amen they'll receive G forgiveness when they accept the Holy Spirit and the way that God say for them to be healed amen they can be healed amen so much talk about healing but yet they won't come to the one way that God has oh I'm so glad to know that there is one way one Lord One Faith one baptism only one there's only one way I am the way the truth and life no man come to the father but by me only by the Holy Ghost amen but yet the brother man I'm talked about how that people will be is sitting in church pews and will die people actually sit in the pews and die when there's a medicine there for them many of them are in as in type and me go to a doctor's office and they'll sit outside the step out by the door they'll sit at the door the doctor will even come out and say hey hey you know come on come on and I've got the solution for you huh no I don't want to come in I don't want to take that medicine it tastes too bad now I understand that whenever people take that medicine they jump up and down they cream it is some really terrible tasting stuff huh people act like Fanatics when they take that stuff people are scream and holler the preachers will get too loud and people run the aisle and everything else and I don't want to do take something that makes me act like that huh guess what they'll never be able to get healed remember the Catholic girl come up Catholic Reporter came up to brother Brandon and they got to talking to him and so forth and trying to criticize and so forth you know and and uh brother B says you know if you ever get to heaven going to have to act like them she says you know she did was wasn't going to act like them folks he says even your mother Mary she was Catholic and she it's even mother Mary was part of the upper room experience when they spoke in tongue shouted come out and scream and so forth and everybody thought they were drunk oh my oh let people in the church let let a church service have people running around staggering under and I've seen how many know you people just stagger just just act like drunk people staggering under the impact of the Holy Ghost to where people thought they were actually drunken they might think it's crazy but yet that's God people can't take in the oh my it cures what Els themen I me the Holy Ghost will cure what HS you it is the cure praise be to God brother bam says some people people say well I just can't keep from sinning brother Brandon I got the cigarette habit I just can't quit I can't quit the drinking at I can't quit this I can't quit temper amen oh my I just can't get rid of it butter Bram says you're only stalling you're just refusing to use God's toxin it'll cure it me believe we got a sure cure we got a sure cure for everything that you think you can't quit that you can't do you're not living the way that you're supposed to you remember this there is a cure and you're just not wanting to take it oh we might say we do I want God more than anything else I want want want but listen if that isn't that down there in the heart it's just here and in here it'll never work it's got to be down here cuz when gets right how many knows when it gets lined up right God will come down with that cure and the desire of it will be gone God will take care of your cans so many people can't do this y get the Cure and you will have a caner somebody in that that can make you do it that can make you love the Lord can make you love your neighbor your family and so forth amen sometimes it's hard but but it always does you good and sometimes it takes bad tasting medicine sometimes to do you any good oh my like brother says some preachers have to preach and I'll tell you what if he preaches too long he says there was a minister come and said you know his Deacon board came up to him and says you know you went over again today we did not call we didn't hire you to come up here and to scold us and to keep us all day and so forth you know and if do that again we'll we'll get you out of here and so forth brother brah says I would love to have that congregation just once first of all we'd stay all day and they'd hear me speak out at least one time they'd hear it he didn't have much for that kind of stuff huh why because sometimes it may not taste real good it might be kind of hard on us sometime folks ain't that right it might be a little hard for us to be told that look if you still have issues and problems is because you didn't take the toxin like you should you haven't got the remedy you haven't been healed of it like you should be healed of it praise the Lord how many know the sin to desire for sin will be gone this is one big major problem in Christianity is people think they can be born again and still have the same desires they did before no no no no it don't work that way not true Christianity amen you get the holy GH go sister and I'll tell you what you go around wearing pants you're going to take them off and put a skirt on you've been cutting your hair you'll let it grow long cuz Paul said that you ought to let it grow long and me brother you ain't been treating your wife right you'll start treating her better than what you did ain't that right sister if you're not subject to your husband it'll start making you be a little more subject that's exactly right little by little why because it tells you the desire of your heart now one thing Prophet taught us and this is this some people don't even accept remember Mr best he says come and prove Pro it there is no such a thing as Divine Healing but we know that when he was bruised for our iniquity chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we were healed amen healing is absolutely in the contract it's part of the Covenant just as much as anything healing is not is only healing that but healing is all so the earnest of the Resurrection before I finish I want to finish with and close with the thought of healing being the earnest of our Resurrection but I want to talk to you about another part brother Bram in 1965 and uh uh uh who is this mzc remember it's one of his last sermons that he preached and he was talking about people having the Holy Ghost and getting the Holy Ghost and so forth he says you listen you women claiming that you got the Holy Ghost and going out here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be certainly it can't he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and listen and then when you come become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that Spirit how many know that's what we're striving for is for our body to be subject to the spirit of God cuz I'm here to tell you one of these days Jesus is going to come in the Clouds of Sky those can can see him that he shows himself to we'll be caught up to meet him in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord but before that happens something has to take place now I want to show you with this reading of this quote to show you whether or not you have a good sign of whether or not is that okay listen close and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest or quickened Made Alive Heen when the Bible says don't do this that body quickly turns to it huh when you hear it is on take and you quickly do it all right there's no question what about this uh he what about it he says it's the earnest of the Resurrection it's the earnest because your body is coming subject to that word coming more like that word this body it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started how many know first your body and your spirit has to come subject to the it gets Rises up higher above sin above doubt above frustration above holding grievances above holding grudges Rises up forgiving everybody their sin nothing have nothing no against no ain't that right having perfect love for everybody it makes me love everybody makes me love ain't that right yeah it it is Raising you up it's already started he said it was one subject to sin and to mire and into corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned Heavenly that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture that's what he said it's the earnest when you find yourself obeying coming subject to the word of God remember if you don't you're just kidding yourself you're lying he that says he loves God keeps not his command is a liar and I'm sure all of us I Know Myself say I know even in this last year I could give you testimony of how God's worked on me he's working on all of us how many beli he's working on every one of us if you're a True Believer he's working on you saying look at that look at this in your life look that in your life amen the Bible says this or brother Braham said that ah he didn't no you don't think that we say God I want to be right how many wants to be right those only those that are right I read a quote down the other day brother B says you know only those that are perfect are going because Jesus says be ye perfect even as my father is in heaven is perfect it'll take Perfection to get you there how many knows every Christian Longs for that Perfection to be healed of everything that's wrong and have that healing bomb coming into your heart and make you what you're supposed to be because we are ready the Bible says we have if this Earthly Tabernacle of this body be dissolved we have already one waiting over y we're already glorified we have a theophany body waiting it's a perfect body and we're longing to go into that perfect body amen the more Perfection you desire the more it shows that you've got a body waiting over there amen amen it's the earnest now the other part now listen a sick person laying dying nothing left but death this is the last part I want to get to this morning how that it shows that every time that we get healed of anything whe no matter what it is Divine Healing he says listen and and then we could take different illustrations like I said a visit Prophet visit South Africa I'm not sure what uh name was but she was down to just Skin and Bones many people were down to just Skin and Bones and that lady said brother brandom all I want you to do is pray that I can die I just want to die is that right she was so miserable and had been so sick and was so skinny she just didn't want to live any longer but instead of Dying God raised her up and healed her prophet of God was just an instrument that God used is't that right Jesus does all the healing and that lady raised up and get more weight and got to live a good life from Skin and Bones whether people are eat up and just absolutely nothing left hundreds and thousands of people in that condition that God raised back up nothing left but death that's all that seems like it could happen I've seen the shadows of people done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis to see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong he says if there is no Divine Healing there is no Resurrection because Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection amen he says you know what earnest money is it's a down payment he was wounded for our transgression by his stripes we are healed not only can he cut or heal your cut not only can he heal your sickness not only can he cure somebody that's just Skin and Bones and cancer not only can he raise that but back that person back up to life to filling out to be happy but one day if your body is completely dissolved in the grave one day he'll heal that he'll raise it back up in that right he'll change it into very I don't care if you were eaten by lions down through the Dark Ages and martyrs mirror and so forth burned that the steak and there's just Adams out there he'll heal it one of these days he'll bring it completely back into perfect form that's why Divine Healing is an Earnest that God can restore he can bring back to its original state that's what we're all looking for is that right folks there's a lot of us you know I'll probably have to take a second look it'll take divine grace amen and I don't know what brother parish is going to look like you know we could have have his picture here at 20 years old but brother I'll tell you what when I meet you I'll know you by God's grace but you're gonna look different then me I'm going to look a whole lot different look at my picture amen at 20 year I look way different we all changed a lot but God's going to restore us back to about 20 years old the prime of our life how many is going to be the ultimate healing the ultimate healing when the Lord comes in the skies and changes these vile bodies into the Glorious Liberty of Jesus Christ how many's looking for that I don't know about you my longing is to see that Resurrection he looking for the Rapture any day now amen that congregation let me encourage you in the name of the Lord keep your eye on the Rapture keep your eye on that end keep it focused amen because everything else is nothing but a distraction nothing more important than to be ready for the Rapture because it could happen any time it astounds me brother Stephen it sounds me to think that we're almost 50 almost 50 years past what brother brandom expecting that's almost half a century maybe seven years or something almost a half a century past what the prophet expected this thing to last is that right I want you to know that's a long time that means it's desperately late amen can I do one more thing for you all right brother stepen send me this here once in a while and I appreciate that get something good if I can find it now will you bear with me how many remembers me playing this Wednesday night listen to this and Donna let's get this playing good just to kind of wake us up show us the lateness of the hour would that be okay thank you listen to this what the prophet said about a vice president and remember thus sayith the Lord there'll be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus sayith the Lord right find out few young people see happens it is I'm a false prophet Lord that scripture could be is could could be right here that woman could be the vice president that scripture be done amen how many believes it's a late hour time to have your hearts your soul ready stand with me this morning time to be ready to go time to leave this place I don't know about you but I have appreciated all that the Lord has done in my life and I'm sure you have to but I'm looking to see his face one of these days how many were to see him face to face we're going to have a body like un his own glorious body amen with all of our heads bowed this morning now let's just enter into a serious moment I want to ask you this morning if you've been completely healed if you feel like you're in the place that if he came at two o'clock this afternoon you would be ready to go or if you would say you know I still need some healing in my soul I still I am not what I should be I haven't taken full full benefit of this toxin this medicine this cure that God has given us and this morning I raise my hand say God I want the Cure completely I'm not yet what I should be but God I pray you'll make me what I ought to be Lord I want to take every minute and every day that I have left to make sure that I'm ready every day standing ready and looking for you God bless those hands God bless you God bless you my hand is up Lord Jesus you see our hands this morning Father And I pray God as we look for the ultimate healing one of these days the changing of our body the resurrection of our loved ones Lord you're not just gonna have to uh cure them from cancer or cure them from this but God you're gonna completely kill them of anything like that and give him a glorious body like unto yours and we're here this morning in church father to ask ourselves and to say God here we are before you and we want to be right with you Lord we want to have the joy of the Lord in our hearts we want to love everybody we want to say be able to say God that I am truly have fully Lord consumed and taken in Lord Jesus to remedy God I'm not sitting on the outside I'm not sitting in the pews Lord and still sick and dying but God I have accepted the Cure that you have given Lord and that cure is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus if there's anyone that doesn't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit hasn't been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sin we ask God you'll lay it on their hearts father then lay it on their hearts to give their hearts unreservedly to you father we ask God that you look upon every heart and every hand this morning draw us all Closer to You Lord and completely heal us so father that we could say Lord the daughter of your people is healed and we're ready and waiting for you Lord we ask God you'll bless every heart and every hand this morning now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you love the Lord Amen Brother David
