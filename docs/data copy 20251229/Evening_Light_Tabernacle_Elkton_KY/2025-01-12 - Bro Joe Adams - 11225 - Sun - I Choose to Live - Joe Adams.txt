to the word this morning uh I'm not going to hold you long but I I do have a message from the Lord this morning that I'd like to deliver to you and I believe the Lord uh will bless it so father we just come to you right now thank you for this opportunity you've given us Lord not just to be in this place this building this church but to be in your presence Lord we're so thankful Lord that you put a longing a longing a desire in our hearts to serve you lord lord many of us we look back over our lives we see where we were and we Rejoice of where we are and Lord we come through a lot of tribulations a lot of rough RADS but Lord we're here we're present today we're accounted for we're part of the economy of God and Lord our Desir is just to yield more of ourselves to you Lord to Humble ourselves and receive correction receive Direction receive encouragement whatever it is that you'd have for us this see this morning God I just open myself up even as a minister Lord may I not be too focused on ministering the word that I can't grow myself and I just invite you Lord I invite your Holy Spirit to deal with every heart Lord to deal with every life Lord every need every situation God we're a people in this Humanity Lord we're not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but God our desire is to be made perfect to be clothed on with your righteousness and we just invite you this morning Lord to have your way bless the service now I pray you bless the ears of the hearer in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles you can turn to Joshua 24 amen I as we got here last week we were here on Saturday night my son and I made it into town and obviously we understand we had some snow come in and some sleep come in that night and we couldn't have church Sunday morning but during the night I was awoken at 3:00 in the morning with a dream and the that dream is the inspiration for this message this morning so I want to preach to you a thought on I choose to live so there's not one of us here whether we're a young person whether we're an old person whether we have lived the life of sin whether we've come out of denominations whether we cut our teeth on a Pew we must choose this day so we're going to look here in Joshua 24 and this is a new year obviously we're in 2025 and I know this is not my home Church brother Thomas this is my second home Church uh this is my New Year's message to evening light Tabernacle Tabernacle Elton Kentucky and so I want to look here and as I said I believe the lord gave me this dream and I will share the dream later during the service with you I'm not going to be pushed for time I'm the one that's got to drive nine hours home you don't so uh I just want to deliver my heart this morning because I believe God inspired it but we find here in Joshua 24 and verse 14 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord then choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood are the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I wonder if we can make that declaration you know we get so caught up in all the events going on that this church is bigger and this church is doing this and this church is doing that and or this family's got this and this family drove up in a new car and this one's got this and everything's going here we're looking everywhere else but I wonder this morning can we make that declaration for me and for my house quit looking at your neighbor's house quit looking at the house of the church member down the road or the next state over but for me and for my house we will serve the Lord amen I love how he said that and the people answered and and said unto him excuse me let me go back he says if it seem good for you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom he'll serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood are the god of the amorites in whose land you now dwell but it's for me and my house we will serve the Lord and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods for the Lord Our God he it is that brought us out of our fathers out of the land of be Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved Us in all the way wherein we went among all the people through whom we passed and the Lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore we will also serve the Lord for he is our god let's keep going and Joshua said unto the people you cannot serve the Lord for he is a holy God he is a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if you forsake the Lord now clue in here Church we're making a declaration this morning we're going to serve the Lord but if notice if you forsake the Lord and serve strange Gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he had done good to you and the people said unto Joshua nay but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people you are with witness against yourselves that you have chosen you that you have that ye have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses now therefore put away said he the strange Gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord Our God we will serve and his voice we will obey so Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and he s them a statute and an ordinance in shikim and Joshua wrote these words in the book of The Law of God and took a great Stone which is a revelation and he set it upon there and under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord and Joshua said unto the people behold this Stone this Stone come on church this this Stone today not Wednesday night coming up not next Sunday but today this Stone shall be a witness unto you for it is for it ha heard all the words of the Lord which spake unto us and it shall therefore a witness unto you lest you deny your God so Joshua let the people depart every man into his inheritance God bless you you can have your seats this evening or this morning so we want to kind of take this thought like I said I'm just going to take my time I will start my timer and if I'm over time you just have to forgive me it may be a few months weeks before I get back so I'll just use some time from that point but I just just want to look at this as maybe a New Year's message I know I'm not a part of your ministry team here I'm definitely not your pastor but as a minister of the gospel and God wakes you up at 3:00 in the morning and gives you a dream that's so vivid and I say Lord please don't let me forget this dream and so I woke up the next morning I begin to just meditate on it and meditate on it meditate on it and I will share it a little bit later but so I just think back here and we see Joshua if we go back to verse or chapter 23 and verse one Joshua charges he gives a charge to the leaders of Israel and I believe today I can give a charge because I'm under that same headship of Christ a charge to the leaders of every household and even like Tabernacle in Joshua here in in Joshua 23 and verse1 it said it came to pass a long time after that that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about that Joshua waxs old and was stricken in age now notice Joshua begins to reflect on his past he G begins to reflect in his old age maybe he's given his new year's message and he looks back of where the people of Israel have come from or maybe where the church has come from they come from a church a little small country white church that had a you know a a little pot belly heater on the inside and and maybe had some out house restrooms and oh we come a long way since then and he's reflecting back and he's sh oh we we've come so far we've we've been through great valleys we've gone through splits we we've gone through hurs we've gone through mountaintops we come a long way and and he's looking back but he calls all the leaders of Israel come here because Joshua knows he's about to cross over and being a an eternal land and he's calling everybody to encourage them notice Joshua didn't called him together to to to beat them over the head he didn't called them together to be destructive and the criticize and point out their flaws point out their weaknesses but Joshua called the leaders together to encourage them to choose you this day and it comes down personal Church to every one of us here this morning choose you this day let's keep reading here and is Joshua called for all of Israel and for the elders and for their heads so Mom Dad you're not escaping the service today dad you have a holy responsibility to your family I'm talking about a holy responsibility and if there's mothers here who are single moms and you have children you bear that same responsibility to your children this is something we may not be able to change everything but we can impact the lives of those that God has entrusted in our care he called the elders and all the heads and for their judges and for the officers and they said unto them I am old and I'm stricken in age otherwise brother B I'm not going to be here much longer but I'm giving you my farewell message I'm giving you my New Year's message and you have seen all that the Lord your God had done unto all the nations because of you look this is beautiful and I want you as a message believing people if we go back and we've heard the the sermons from 47 to 65 and some of you may have witnessed brother brandom's meetings and you may have seen the display of the supernatural but even aside from Brother Brandon's personal Ministry look at what God has done in the ministry of the Bride from that point because they received the same word the same Revelation now Joshua's going back and he's beginning to tell him of all that the Lord has done oh that's just beautiful he begins to remind them of the great battles they won brother Thomas the great victories brother Thomas that God had wrought for them and he secured for them and for the people of God and he tells them you have seen it you have witnessed all that the Lord had done and he says your God is he that had fought for you and but he says now in verse four Joshua 23 and verse4 behold I have divided unto you bot these nations that remain to be be an inheritance for your tribes from Jordan and with the Nations that I have cut off even unto the great seed Westward and the Lord your God he shall expel them from before you and drive them out of your sight and you shall possess their land as the Lord your God has promised you now there's some of you sitting here this morning that is yet to possess that PO portion of land but God has promised it for you God has promised it for you fathers for you mothers for you children the Bible says as many as the Lord Our God shall call let me tell you if I was a parent here this morning a father and a mother and I had children that just doesn't really seem like they want to get behind the movement of God and they just come and they just sit down and you know instead of criticize and get on your knees in your prayer closet get on your knees and seek God and say God go oh God you're the great king and we heard this past Wednesday night you got one more move God move for my son God move for my daughter God may you put a desire in their heart to serve you I don't want to criticize them for doing his criticize them from doing act all your criticizing does is push them out of the house of God and out of your house but but you get down on your knees and you earnestly begin to pray God I need them I want them I claim them and begin to call God on the scene say God I'm coming to you as a king and I'm asking for something that only a king can give give me my Offspring give me my children give me my desire to serve you give them a passion for the message may they be more than just Pew siners and just oh those that just occupy and and Spectators but God may they be participators in the work of [Music] God I go to enough churches I see enough young people matter of fact you see enough people in general some of them just sit there and they just wish you'd hurry up they' just come to church and you know for them a few good songs and a little maybe a goosebump here or there a good shaking good everybody clap real quick you know they they fill up so quick when it comes to the word but come on church tonight he goes I've divided I divided unto you the land it's the land of your enemy but I'm giving them to you come on Mom come on dad all the enemy tries to claim them and put a claim on them and this and that and got them all twisted up in the world but I've divided the land I Divi I've given it to you personally as a father I've given you your children as a mother I've given you your children as a family I've given you your home as a church I've given you the word I've divided you the land don't you settle for second place don't you walk out defeated but claim yes Lord I receive my inheritance this morning yes notice in verse five and the Lord your God he shall expel woo right there kick him out of the house kick him out of the church not the people the spirits the Lord your God he shall expel them before you and drive them out of your sight and ye shall possess their land notice in verse six he says but be you therefore very courageous to keep and to do I'm taking my time personally this morning to keep and to do not just merely believing but to keep that means to store in your heart to keep it there to meditate on it and to do that means to act that means you got to put your faith your beleving in action and if it never comes into action then you don't really believe but to keep and to do that is written in the book of the law of Moses that you turn not aside there from to the right hand or to the left hand now I touched on some things Wednesday night and I'm going to touch on them again this morning and I got a purpose behind it so we find here in Joshua 7 that he says that you come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them otherwise don't take an oath by their gods neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them now I spoke just a little bit Wednesday night on when God calls a man he calls for a total separation so we're going to look at this again because I've been studying all week preparing because I know God gave me this thought and I believe if God give a man woke him up at 3:00 in the morning a week knowing I wasn't even supposed to be here this Sunday I was supposed to be in complete another church but I believe God kept me here for one one person that can receive this word that'll make that declaration this morning I choose to live so we look here now he says but cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done unto this day for the Lord has driven out from before you great Nations and strong notice he's given you many great battles and he's given you a lot of great victories but as for you no man has been able to stand before you m so not only is is Joshua showing how great God is but he's even showing how great you are as a people that will follow God that would trust God that would stay in obedience with the word of God that will do what totally separate yourself from unbelief he says oh man he says one man you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God he it is that fight us for you as he ha promised you take good heed therefore unto yourselves that you love the Lord your God that's good that you love the Lord your God not the Lord in the world not the Lord in your video game not the Lord in your makeup not the Lord in your fashion but the Lord hallelujah the Lord your God brother Brown makes a statement he said God called Abraham him being 75 years old and he said separate yourself from your Kindred now young person it's not just God dealing with you there's some 75 year old that's been sitting on the bench a long time oh they ain't made one move but God is calling you for a total separation he goes separate yourself from your Kindred you know when when God called me brother Brad I left all that I had over Mississippi I left all my friends I left my family behind I didn't know one person well I take that back I had an aunt and uncle in Louisiana and I I left everything and I moved in with them for a few months and before I got my own place but I left it all because when God calls a man it's time that you separate from your unbelieving Associates you can't hang on and I'm just going to be their friend let me tell you I'm just going to go down to the bar and I'm going to witness to them no God is calling for a total separation you got to separate yourself and be yolked up with the Holy Ghost and receive that anointing and receive that life before you can dare be a true witness of this message but notice what brother bam says he goes it's strange how we change that today God called for separation but we call for mixers oh we like those cool preachers they just you know he he gets me you know he just gets in there and you know he don't really preach real hard he's a lot of faith and da d d and I'm not saying anything negative about that but you know we don't hear that closed we don't want that closed line religion we don't want that heavy stuff we want you know what if if if if the preachers would just stay down here on this light upu and just tell us what we want to hear you know that's what we want you don't think your Prophet dealt with that notice what he say he say the people when you're choosing their Pastor you do that so he says they want a little slick fella you know that that take a social drink and he won't condemn smoke and a few other things a good guy that'll mix with the crowd let me tell you I'm not mixing with nobody's personality I'm not mixing I'm not compromising I'm staying with the word I'm staying with the message say I came out 255 years ago and I dare to go back to that lifestyle I dare to go back for me and for my house for me and for my family we're going to serve God we're going to live for God we choose to live this [Applause] morning why compromise why do you want a mixer we all want a mixer you want to make sure you're in the wrong Church you're in to make you want to make sure you got the wrong wrong God this morning God calls for a total separation from the things of the world oh here we go again you're going to beat us up again notice the Bible says be ye separate it doesn't say mix together oh maybe you can you know if you just kind of compromise here and there maybe you'll win everybody no be ye separate sayth the Lord and I will receive you see we want mixers God wants separators not a mixer a separator the Holy Ghost spoke separate me Paul and bartimus to the work see a separation God segregates his people that's from right and from wrong see Abraham was to separate himself in the sojourn and us Strange Land that he knew not of isn't that a beautiful picture today when God by election called you to to his beloved then immediately God speaks to you to separate yourself from the old crowd the pool room the Stitch and sew parties where they tell jokes and carry on a separation brother M says now I'm possessing all things 1962 he said Abraham had it kind of rough you say yeah I believe you know I I I can I can com I mean I can understand what Abraham went through no you cannot there ain't a one of us here this morning has had it rough you're blessed very blessed of the Lord he said there was lot having an easy waiting and waiting just waiting and sin how easy it is and how pleasing sin looks to be how innocent it looks to be now if lot says this notice what he says as long as I believe I believe in God so why can't I go down here in Sodom it'll be all right see the mentality of a lot well I believe but notice when God called Abraham he called him to separate himself from every thing and that's what we have to do that's what your Prophet saying that's what we have to do God calls us to a total separation from sin come out from among it be not partakers of it shun it the very appearance of evil separation completely annihilated from it stay your distance away from it don't tread upon its grounds no matter how nice it looks so we find many today brother Thomas they have theot mentality well brother Joe I believe God sent a prophet mean my mom and dad they play tapes all my life I believe brother brandom's Vindicated I believe he's a prophet of God and yet they still live in sin they still as we would say have one foot in the world and one foot in church so I asked ask you you that have that foot in the world and that foot in church church has got to be more than appeasing our religious conscience it's more than our religious responsibilities and our religious duties and we find that there's a lot of a lot of Christians are believers today that you know what just as long as I believe God in Prophet I'm okay and you see the world and the influence all over them I've been to churches and I'm not condemning please don't take it as that this morning but I'm just pouring my heart out I've been to churches and I preached to bobbed hair makeup I mean painted up Jezebel's in a message church with their hands raised worshiping God in all sincerity that they know just because they believe God sent a prophet and got the entire look of the world on their life the Bible says in 1 John we're going to go down this road just for a minute the Bible says in 1 John 2 and verse 15 love oh oh there we go now you gonna get something nice we're gonna talk about the love no you just buckle up the Bible says love not the world all the young people just de they just quit on me I see it look at him they're like oh here he goes we get this at every camp meeting so why do you get it because we love you we sincerely want to see you see you with a desire see your heart overwhelmed to serve God we don't want to see you complacent we don't want to see you content in the world we want to see you take that foot out of the world and put it on the word and stand on the things of God to make a declaration I may be a young person this morning but I choose to live I choose to serve God I choose to follow God that's what our desire should be we're not here to beat you over the head and condemn you no we're here to take your hand and to lift you out of the things of the world and bring bring you to the promise of the [Applause] word says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world then the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever so I want to break this word some of these words down for you this morning we think about lust and the Bible talks about the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes now initially when you hear lust you think you got a sexual problem no that's because a lot of times that's that that's kind of How It's portrayed but notice this word lust means desire craving longing desire for what is forbidden desire for that which is forbidden notice but and we think about you can have a lust for money till you'll treat your neighbor wrong just to get the upper hand you have a Lust For position you don't matter who you step on just so you can climb that ladder of success you can have a Lust For power and you can see Powers Collide even in a church when there's some deacons that want to take control of the ministry and that nickan Spirit we finally they reverse niotis to where they feel like they have a say you can have a lust for power a lust for vengeance you can have a lust for beauty some of you young girls you have a lust for beauty because you don't feel secure in how God Made You and then you see the vog magazines and you see the you know the the influencers all over the social media God ain't calling you to that God's calling you to a holy life but we can have a lust for beauty and a lust for an acceptance a desire to be accepted in the wrong groups with the wrong people so you say brother Joe I don't love the world now let me just get you straight I don't love the world all right well let's just look at it and see you search your heart so when we look at verse 15 there's two forms of the word love in this one verse the Bible says the first form is agapo it's to welcome to entertain to be fond of to love dearly to be be well pleased to be contented at or with a thing to Delight in all right so you got that definition the next form of the word love that is used and it's used toward God or the Father's Love toward us the second is agape and that is affection or benevolence so when we read this let's reread this scripture here and kind of see how it says in 1 John 2 and verse 15 if you love or entertain the world or he's saying love not or entertain not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love or is fond of or pleased with or contented with the world then the love or the benevolence the affection of the father is not in him if you're contented with the world if you're please if your appetite is filled up with the things of the world you gulp down movies and you gulp down you know secular uh radios and and mo uh uh songs and different things like that if you're feeding on other things then it shows you that there is a love a desire a contentment with what the world can offer you and he says and when that is the case then the love the benevolence the affection of the father is not in your heart so when we read it like this we can see that God is calling for a total separation God is calling for you to be different do you understand young people that fashion you know a lot of times we want to be fashionable and let me just let's just agree M Believers we're a little bit behind the curve on fashion it's okay we're not at the height of fashion we may be year two three years but as we find that the Next Generation and is socially connected with social media and things like that then we're not so far behind the curve as we used to be but you know just last month I went to Hollywood California I was out there preaching to an Hispanic group of people and we went to Hollywood and we walked down the the Hollywood Boulevard and the stars the the stars of fame or the Walk of Fame and let me just tell you it ain't all is cracked up to be it is filthy homeless everywhere marijuana drugs on the street needles on the street bums on the Street Homeless on the street it's not a safe place to go and yet Hollywood is the one that is putting out the fashion and the trends that many of our young people are yoking their yourself up with it is the pit of Hell and you're telling me that you're satisfied with those things if you can only see the spirit behind it if you can only see the spirit behind some of the dress or the fashion some of the movements so I'm not trying like I said I'm not here to condemn you today I'm just want to encourage you look Beyond where is the influence coming from I was at a church one time and I preached on some bracelets and I preached on necklace says and and I had a brother come to me afterwards he says you got to show me that in the message I mean really I'm going to have to show you that in the message so I went and look it's not in the message and he probably like woo told you told you I can wear my necklace I'm like but here's the deal when brother brandham when he was asking question and answers by the Ladies by the ladies I say it again by the sisters can we wear jewelry he said it's okay to wear jewelry just don't look like you went through through a 10 cent store with a magnet on now that's the ladies trying to be right with God but yet you see the influence of the world bringing it right in and now it's a trend it's a fashion it has a spirit connected to it coming from somewhere and now we have young men all throughout the message we got preachers out there and they wearing bracelets and necklaces and all kinds I'm talking about where are we going to hold a standard now let me just say this I don't think it's Heaven or Hell at least I hope not but I'm asking you see the spirit behind the influence of it see the spirit behind the influence question and answers brother brandham 1964 he's asked that question and now we're 60s something years past or right at 60 years past that 61 how dare a brother ask brother can I wear this type he would probably say where you getting your influence if you love I'm trying to bring it back to scripture if you love if you entertain if you're contented with the Fashions the movements the movies all these things of the world then the love the affection the benevolence as a husband to his wife is not going to be there because God is a gentleman like I said I'm not here to condemn you I'm not here I'm here to encourage you I'm here to speak to you God is calling for a total separation why come this far why come so close and to let something so frivolous you say well brother Joe what if I can get in wearing my necklace or what if I can get in cutting my hair what if I can get in wearing my makeup what if you can't let's just make it personal what if you can't so why come this far so close look around and you see the times that we're living in even nominal Church system recognize we can't be here much longer why play church I'm trying to encourage you you got to make your declaration you can either serve the gods of your fathers that they served on the other side of the flood the gods of fashion the gods of Hollywood because your father and your mother they used to do all those things they used to look that way do that kind of stuff or you can serve this God the only true Liv Living God so when God calls brother said God has a provided way when he calls for a total separation from all things of the world Annihilation from worldly things so today some of you may not like that whole deal on jewelry especially some of you young boys if that's what you're doing and you may want to throw eggs at me right now and that's completely all right but I'm just telling you take it back to the message take it back to the message you know what if I hurt your feelings I'm sorry I'm taking it back to the word I'm not compromising my my son Joseph asked me when he was 8 years old though he played on a A Little League World Series ball team he was a you know Little League World Series kid and and all of them got these bracelets because they got to go to this certain tournament and we made the World Series and D I said buddy you can put that on your back but it ain't going on your wrist he wanted to be like the other boy and that's okay to be to be accepted but there's got to be a Joshua that says for me and for my family we're going to hold true to the standards of the word we're going to hold true it may not be uh Pleasant and he may have been a little bit rejected by it but you know what he's never questioned me not one time he's 19 years old I've not had one struggle with my son with a desire to do any of that cuz he was taught from a little boy that's not what we do we hold to the word of God well I don't see it black and white well see the spirit behind it see question behind it why people some of the question and answers seem to be so frivolous brother brandom can we wear our pajamas when we go to bed at night he goes I don't see why you would want to do that you're a lady just a nice slip or a gown would do I mean we could talk about the young people what about that they had sincere questions they sincerely wanted to be right right and he says I don't know why you would want to do that when a nice nice gown would do you know a house coat or whatever but we we have gotten so far removed and let me I don't want to get ahead of myself like I said I got all day today church so I'm just going to try to preach this and feel the leadership of the Lord but bear again please I'm encouraging you search your heart search your motive search your desires that's right because you can hide from your pastor you can hide from the the assistant ministry here brother Brad or any evangelist coming in hide from me but you're not going to hide from yourself and you're not going to hide from God the two of you know for sure exactly where your heart is lending notice here in Jehovah jahra total separation from all not just some not just school not just this not just that but all unbelief and remember Abraham the patriarch was never absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what God said to do and will never never be blessed any and have the blessings until we obey what God Said do we now he's taking it from 2,000 years ago or even beyond that and bringing it bringing it up to date we will never be fully blessed truly blessed until we do what God says do notice Abraham when he left Earth he didn't receive the Holy Ghost he didn't receive the promised land when he just left Earth well you know just coming out as one thing but God is Not only calling you out God is calling you in so we find Abraham had to fully obey he never received the promise just by leaving her he had to separate from his father that's right he had to separate from his nephew lot he had to separate from his family but notice what Abraham did Abraham chose lot chose Sodom he chose the world Abraham chose the barren lands the hard land it was the harder way but it was the precise way and God rewarded Abraham God blessed Abraham because Abraham separated himself he detached himself from family attribution generational curses and whatever it may be family influence he said no I'm going to follow the [Applause] Lord I'm going to follow the [Applause] lord that's exactly right and brother B makes a statement in the token message now we're all familiar with the token he says when you fully obey the word of God in full surrender young people clue in on that full surrender I mean there ain't no foot dangling in the world I saw your pastor I watched a clip of your pastor day he did this or something like that trying to sit on the desk so I know anything can go in here just as long as the spirit has this way so we ain't dangling are feet in the world but a full surrender that means you check your Revelation you check your experience by the word of God if it doesn't line up then you need to line up if it doesn't line up then you need to make a declaration today me and my family me and my house I am going to choose to serve the Lord I'm going to give God a full surrender a full obedience a Full Sacrifice I'm gonna serve God I'm gonna live for God now we live in a day brother Brad of an entitlement and Society right everybody feels entitled well I'm entitled to that Pew right there let me just tell you what you are entitled to by your prophet he says full obedience to the word and full surrender it entitles you to the Holy Ghost now you want to talk about entitlement mentality you fully surrendered to God fully surrendered to the word and full obedience to him and God will fill you with the Holy Ghost you won't have to question it you won't have to doubt it you won't have to go searching for it you won't have to fast about it God will fill you with the Holy Ghost but you must come under full obedience to the word he says yes sir obedience not he that saith Lord Lord but he that doeth the will full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the Token no other way there is that you could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word you hear people today said you know I got the Holy Ghost and yet things pop up many years later things pop up out of their life they had the Holy Ghost because they came and they shouted I'm not saying that the Holy Ghost didn't make you shout but you don't shout to get it but once you get it you will shout some of them got emotional some of them ran I got the Holy Ghost I ran you know what I go look there's some track stars out there they run every other Saturday ain't none of them got the Holy Ghost but they CLA oh I did this and I don't say that you you didn't come under the the the Holy Ghost anoint your flesh to do these things but I'm not talking about the Holy Ghost on the flesh I'm not talking about the Holy Ghost on the outside I'm talking about the token life the literal life of Jesus Christ coming on the inside of you and full obedience to the message full obedience to the word of God entitles you then more to more than just to shout to More Than Just A Dance to more than just an emotion it entitles you to the very life of Jesus Christ no matter how rough it gets how low it gets you'll come out because why because it ain't your life it's his life living inside of you bringing you through it Lord give us the Holy Ghost give us more than just a sensation give us more than just an emotion but fill our every fi Lord with the baptism of the Holy Ghost what did John 3:5 Jesus tells them he said very verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and a spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is fleshly that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee that ye must be born again what does it mean to be born again it means to receive Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Ghost the genuine brother man we call it that the true genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost so we find here in the token message brother BR says now when he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar because some of us mistake that we go to camp meetings I see young people I work with young people at the camp meetings you go and you see them have an emotional response but your month later two months later they're back down have to go to another camp meeting to come back up where's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the keeper he's a stabilizer you get I'm not saying you're not going to have bad days but I'm telling you you're not going to have those kind of days you're not going to drop off in the slumps when you got the baptism of Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is keeping power he's a stabilizer brother B says what time he goes you know those great big ships they put stabilizers on the ships no matter what kind of ways they coming through it stabilizes the ship and he says and God has given us the stabilizer the baptism of the Holy Ghost no matter what kind of waters we come across we have a stabilizer it stabilizes us against the waves and he said they will no by any means overtake us but we will crest every one of them oh sister daughter we're going to come over cancer it ain't nothing God's given us a stabilizer a stabilizer no matter what cancer is it could be breast cancer it could be lymphoma it doesn't matter God is given a stabilizer in this day he's given us the means the baptism of the Holy Ghost to [Applause] overcome said it don't mean jump up and down at the altar that don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've we've seen done it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means death to your first being if you get mad at me just want to get mad at your Prophet cuz I'm preaching what he said death to yourself means you got to put your pride aside you got to put your arrogance aside got to put your thoughts aside got to quit looking at the preacher with darts in your eyes and say okay help me line up this morning it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus and if he be the vine and we are the branches then the life that's in the branch must flow out through the or the life in the vine must flow out through the branches so the very same things he did we must do also we can't compromise church so Jesus's first Doctrine how many knows what it was y'all don't know I'll tell you you say Jesus's first doctr his first teaching it's so simple ye must be born again that was his first teaching and if he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then it's still teaching today it still applies brother bad today Mom Dad young old we must be born again not born of a church not born of a theology not born of a Doctrine but born of the spirit of the Living God but you find today my my my my can I keep going please say yes you find today that many many many well let me back up you say brother Joe you kind of been strong on this statement you've been laboring pretty hard on this why are you laboring so hard on this thought God gave you a dream for our church God gave you something for the church yeah he did let me just share what he says here what was the Holy Ghost given for he goes to you people it's absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsary that you receive the Holy Ghost now for if you don't you can't come in the resurrection you understand that church you understand that young people do you understand why it's compulsory it's necessary that you receive the Holy Ghost now not wait you're not promised the next camp meeting you're not promised another service but you are promised now then in another place he said Satan doesn't care how religious you are how right you are in your Doctrine if you missed that life if you miss the life of the Holy Ghost you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again that's why I'm laboring about being born again that's why I'm challenging you look at your heart look at your desires don't just go through the motions don't just settle for a goosebump don't just settle for good service don't just settle for you know maybe a shout here or a shout there I talk about taking your experience with the word do I have the Holy Ghost and you and God know andbody say like this and you and the devil know and we find we as a message Community second third fourth Generations now beginning to drift away from the principles of the message you find as the Next Generation goes if they're not taught right in if there's not the high priest of the home then you'll find that next Generation begin to drift and the things of God the preaching of the gospel and the message of the hour won't seem so so important to them man brother Joe you said you had a message it it's coming so we have people in our churches today we have young people in our church I have children they don't know what it means to be out in the World they don't know what it means to belong to a Baptist Church or a Pentecostal church or some other form of denomination they don't know we got we got Generations sitting right here in Elton Kentucky you've not known anything but this church you've not known anything but this message but yet you don't understand the reality of the prophet of the message why did God send you a prophet that turn your heart away from denominationalism away away from unbelief away from sin well brother Joe we don't sin we're not out there we we were right here in the church but yet your heart is so far from God he says in one place with their mouth they profess me but their hearts are far away and this is what Israel was doing they've been through great battles they've seen great victories they come through the flood they come out of Egypt they destroyed the walls of Jericho just by shouting woo just by shouting they come to a Cades barer they went around the mountain for 40 years but one day it's time to come Joshua take him in divide the land give them their inheritance God sent you a Joshua the Holy Ghost in this day to divide the promises to us and notice what Joshua was saying to them choose you this day who you're going to serve whether you're going to serve the god of the amorites whether you're going to serve the god of the Egyptians or whether you're going to serve the god that your fathers did on the other side of the flood that's not talking about Noah's flood that's about the great flood of the river of frees so he says you got a choice let me tell you somebody today young person or old you're going to serve something you're going to serve somebody something is going to be your God boys it could be your girlfriend you can make her your God husband it could be your wife or whatever it could be your car brother B says it's all kind of things that we make a God but God is Desiring your worship God is Desiring your praises this morning God is asking you as a church body who will you serve that's right we're fine today but many of our young people and we have it at evening light Tabernacle in M Louisiana the same we treat the message as a list of dos and don'ts well I don't wear makeup okay this is what we do this is our religion it's our covering I don't wear and I wear my hair long I wear skirts I don't dress inappropriate and we do all these things and it's a list and not love it's a list it's rules we follow versus obedience to the word and if you can ever twist your thinking or change your thinking to where it's no longer a list of dos and don'ts but you're in love with the author then you would understand why our Our Ladies don't wear or cut their hair why they don't wear makeup we understand why our boys don't look like the world cuz now it's a love that due benevolence that I spoke of earlier let's keep on going now but you find you're finding more in this day that we go people say the Lord Lord delays his coming I know nobody here has said that Matthew 24 and verse 46 says blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but he that but if that evil servant shall say in his heart my the Lord delayeth his coming he shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with and be drunk Dr see you find those you know we have people they say it they may not say it in their mouth or with their mouth but they're saying it with their heart they're saying it with their attitude so we find as Joshua we go back here in Joshua 24 and verse one Joshua gathers all the tribes of Israel because he's trying to get them now if we're we're gonna start bringing this home I'm G I'm gonna have you out by 1:00 is that okay man that was a weak amen I figur the young people be shouting right about now yeah hurry up man but notice here Joshua gathers all the tribe of Israel at shikim and he called the elders and the heads and the judges and officers and he presents and he begins to tell them you got a choice that lays before you today he didn't deny that you're going to serve something but he's telling you got to make a choice whom you're going to serve see notice Abraham's father Tara if y'all know much about Tara I'll did some research on this he wasn't just an average citizen he was a military General under Nimrod also tradition relates that Tara's son Abraham was born nimrod's astrologers warned that this child will one day conquer the land and fearful of nimrod's Wrath Tara hid Abraham his mother and the wet nurse in a cave for 10 years Terror was deeply involved in idol worship even running a shop that sold idols and history has it Legend has it that Tera let Abraham he had to oversee the shop one day and Abraham got all the little gods and he he put the big God right in the middle and he put all the other little Gods all around the big God and he smashed all the little gods and when Tara came back and he said Abraham why' you do this he said you know he said he said I didn't do it the god in the middle did it the big God did it and ter said you know that that's not a God you know that's just something that we sell he says that's exactly right it's not a God so why do you want to sell it to the people as if it is a God and that's what I'm trying to tell you this morning these things that I'm talking about they're just little bitty make belief God but there's only one true Living God and he's the one that's worthy to be praised he's the one that's worthy to be served this morning don't give your affection to some false god some Idol give it to almighty God worship and serve the Living God Tara was an astrologer he practiced astrology saw the Stars he knew that his son Haron would die by fire but that his descendant would fill the land now notice Abraham married Heron's daughter Sarah and he had a dream he was an astrologer he knew that his son har would die but that his seed would fill the land and he did it through Sarah so despite all the Decades of idol worship ter eventually saw the truth and belief in one God so he came around but notice Abraham God says I took you from took your father Abram from the other side of the flood and him throughout all the land of Canaan and multiply the seed and gave him Isaac I gave unto Isaac Jacob and and Esau and I gave unto Esau s to possess it but Jacob and his children went down to to Egypt I sent Moses also now he's going to tell them the history now he's coming to tell them the testimonies sometimes it's good for us to be reminded of what great things God has done right here in our local assembly let me tell you in a few months we're going to hear another great testimony how God overcame cancer how God defeated cancer and he's going to be sharing it to you you have witnessed this you have seen this this is who I am this is what I'm doing in your miss your eyes have witnessed the supernatural I brought you out of the land I brought your father out I I've done all these great things he says I sent Moses and Aaron I plagued Egypt according to that which was done among them and afterward I brought you out I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you came into the sea and the Egyptians pursued after your your fathers with chariots and Horsemen un the sea and when they Cried unto the Lord I put Darkness between you and the Egyptians and I brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt and you dwelt in the wilderness a long season and I brought you into the land of the amorites this is Joshua 24:8 which dwelt on the other side of Jordan and they fought with you and I gave them into your hand that you might possess their land and I destroy them from before you then he says in verse n then baac the son of zipper king of Moab arose and he war against Israel and he s he called balam the son of beor to curse you and but I would not hearken unto balum therefore he blessed you still oh church people tried to curse you but God just blesses you brother Joe look at your blessings oh my people try to curse you and condemn you but God's blessed you and multiplied your hand let's keep going he goes I went over Jordan and you went over Jordan and came unto Jericho and the men of Jericho fought against you and the amorites and the perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hittites and the gites and the hivites and the jebusites and I deliver delivered them into your hand and I sent Hornets before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with the sword nor with thy bow I've given you land for which you did not labor and cities which you did not build and you dwelt in them of The Vineyards and Olive yards which you ye planted not do you eat my he's reminding him everything that you have is because of me everything that you have is because of me and he's showing them all the great testimonies you should have been drowned in that red sea but I parted the seas in your life I brought you through I destroyed those task Masters that used to beat you and condemn you and accuse you I destroyed them and you saw the waters over overtake them I God had done all this and Joshua before his passing is reminding Israel of all that God has done and I love how God sometimes reminds us brother Tommy of where we have come from taking desire drugs right out of your life take the desire women and alcohol and party and that kind of kind of living right out of your life he's brought you through deep trials and afflictions and he's brought some of us older ones out of denominational isms and he placed you in the word of God in the can I say it like this he placed you in the promised land notice he reminds them to show them that this you must recognize the supernatural that's been in our midst this is not Legend though it's legendary this is not myth because he's greater than any myth and if we not having any ties to the message and see what God had done through a prophet in the 60s and 40s and 50s we would think it's all Legend but some of you here today can testify of the same power the same Grace the same healings that was done there is being done here again today because God doesn't change God doesn't change so he placed him in the choice land a great land a land that flows with milk and honey a land that God chose for the elect and God has taken you out of foreign lands you here this morning out of foreign lands and he's placed you in the message placed you in the word and he begins to remind them of all that he's done all the enemies that he destroyed I'm gonna go a little bit further now try to oh I got a lot of ground to cover I got 45 minutes can I go 45 minutes notice showed them all the great enemies we heard through a prophet's Ministry cancer was defeated heart trouble Was Defeated blinded eyes open Dead Boys raised again dead babies come back to life he's showing all the he said there's nothing that stood before God and there's nobody that can stand before you so God has brought us here today not just here in this church but he's brought you here in this age cuz there's never been another people like you there's never been another age like this age you say what makes it so special brother Joo because there is going to be somebody that's going to fulfill the scriptures of being a part of those that are alive and remain those that are focused no matter what they see no matter the political drama out in the world no matter about Hollywood burning and Russia's in a war with the Ukraine and this is going on and that is going on and people are drifting away people are leaving the message yet God is determined I will have a bride she will be without spot she will be without blemish she will be perfect because a perfect word a perfect message has come and she has stressed herself with the baptism of the Holy Ghost she's put on the robe of righteousness she's not walking by her own ability she's walking by the power of a living God [Applause] I believe if we could be honest with ourselves today church this is the new year let's go into this new year and let's check it up and let's look back over this past year 23 and covid and my we could just go back and go back and go back and you will see God's hand God's hand no matter the dip in the valley no matter the rise in the mountain you had great days God's hand has been upon this church it's been upon your pastor been upon Brother Brad the minister he's been upon each and every one of you to bring you to where we are today Satan tried to divide this church 20 something years ago but you're still here come on church I said you're still here Satan tried to get among it he tried to divide it cause division but we're here why because it ain't you it's not about you it's God's hand upon you you just stay faithful to God stay faithful to him and choose what you're going to serve and choose who you're going to serve and God will continually watch over you and bring you [Applause] out he brought many of us out of the lands of idol worship maybe one time I come I'll give my personal testimony detailed and you can see what fuels my passion for this message cuz I've been there I've been on that side of the flood I've tasted of the good things of God I've tasted of the realities the power not just the supernatural look we've all had low moments let's not sugar coat and think we're in a fairy tale and this is some kind of Disney land dream no we've all have been there but you got to choose you this day who you're going to serve see it's God that has led us to the message and you young people say well I didn't get LED I was born into it well by the grace of God you were think about what family you could have been born into you could have been born into a a meth infected family where you're having withdrawals and you're coming out deformed and you come out with addictions to drugs you could have been birthed into that but God birthed you into the family that believes the message that serves God Under the Umbrella of this message well you got Purity and Holiness and godliness wrapped all over you Church you are birth into a family that had come to the house of God that serve God Wednesday and Sunday and every day don't you take it for granted where you are God had brought you to this it's God's favor upon you [Applause] God LED you to this message he said he'll bless our goings in he'll bless our coming out he'll bless the fruit of our lands the fruit of our hands he'll bless the fruit of our Fields he'll bless our churches we're blessed we're blessed and it's not man's doing it's God's doing so we can look and we can recount and I like brother B he preaches a message of thought as I thought on my ways sometimes it does US good to think about our ways as I told you Wednesday night there's not a day goes by that I'll wake up and I thank God for this message because I know where I was without it there's not a day that I don't lay my head on a pillow in the last prayers God God thank you for the truth for opening my eyes so that I can see it I don't take it for granted because I made a choice brother Tommy I made a choice to live and to serve God and you must make that same Choice young person you must make that same choice Mom you must make that same Choice Papa father leader of the home you must make that same choice so Joshua is causing the men to look look where we are can we on this new year look back brother Thomas is a church body when there used to be a little church with ouses as sister Donna said last night we were talking she says back when we had ouses you didn't see people popping up like popcorn running into the bathroom nobody wanted to go to the ouse maybe we needed shut the bathrooms put ouses in the back you give a preacher a complex every time you jump up and walk out like woo they going walk out on that one woo walking out on that one put some ouses ain't nobody running out we'll be sitting there holding it shake it yeah but look where the churches come from look where you have come from Lord amen look where you have come from we think about the church and we can see we can reflect over that and we can see the pot belly we can see the was flying around and M we can see the beautiful church God has blessed you with and a congregation brother Thomas that God has blessed you with and we can see we've been through battles it's not come easy but Joshua is showing them here we are in the land we're in the land of promise and can I tell you that we are in the land of the opening of the word the land of promise Generations Church ages have waited for this time and you're here I said you're here Lord this message went down through the Dark Ages and it was almost snuffed out was almost wiped out but God be to restore and look at it you you are the final restoration of what God's desire is and can I tell you like this that God is not complete without you and when we take a rapture we are the very completion of every thought that God had because he had thoughts of you before the foundation of the world and no matter what you'd have to come through no matter what afflictions you had to face God knew that you was going to be here and that you would be an overcomer and he's going to reward them that overcome to he that overcometh and the L to C and H will I grant to sit with me in my Throne that means there's going to be a bride ruling and reigning with him overcoming the loud de seeing Spirit of lukewarmness of cold formal of just going to church but they are going to be on fire for God they are going to be set apart separated from the things of the world oh Hallelujah somebody say Amen to the word of God we're not among those that are out there we are among the alive and the [Applause] remain he says Joshua 24:14 therefore fear the lord fear the lord job 28:28 behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom to depart from Evil is to have understanding Psalms 2 and vers 11 serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling Proverbs 1:7 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge reverence him church as a sole object of your religious worship it ain't about believing God sent a prophet I'm glad you do but if you just believe God s a prophet and you're not reverencing him what point what point what purpose notice reverence him for all the great things that he has done fear Him for goodness sake let him be your influence then we find in Joshua 24 and verse1 14 it says serve him in sincerity and in truth I hope this is okay brother Thomas serve him in sincerity and in truth so the Latin word here for sincerity comes from a word that denotes honey without wax honey without wax otherwise unmix Purity the Greek word is considered by some to be founded on the idea that something is held up into the Rays of the Sun and is proved to be without Speck or flaw there's going to be a church that God is going to raise up and he's going to lift up to the raise of his son and he's going to find she's Church she's my church she's bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she's my church she's without spot she's without blemish she's not laid down in a bed of Affliction when it's some man's idolatry but no she's a Church of the Living God and there's no flaw found in her sincerity and in truth serve him uprightness of your soul without hypocrisy or deceit and according to the truth of his word the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 5 and verse 6 your glor is not good know you not that A little leav leaven a whole lump how many Bakers do we have in here this morning man we don't have very many people raise their hand thank you for putting your hand up thank you I mean y'all scared leav little bit of yeast will flow out through the whole lump of dough and it leavens the whole lump but notice what it says here it says Purge out there for the old leaven once you put the leaven in you got to be quick to remove the leaven from the lump or the entire lump becomes leavened says that you may be a new lump so notice when we have this kind of preaching it's not not to condemn you but that you'll become a new lump for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth now I'm going to skip some things because I want to get somewhere and we find brother bandam had a dream he had a dream of a mamba snake this m B snake was coming at him hissing he said it got to get closer and try to hit but it would miss it couldn't attack me he said then it turned from me they went to my friend he's jumping over jumping over jumping over and he said God if if that thing hits him he's going to die and the Lord came now in his dream and said you have been given power to bind him and the worst come on church he he said the serpent turned to me and I said I looked at me again and a voice came from heaven and said you've been given power to bind him the worst are any and I said God what must I do he said there's one thing that you must do you must be more sincere don't you understand why I'm my heart has been pulled this this way this morning it's not to condemn you it's not to bash you it's not to criticize you but it's to encourage you to be more sincere he said you have been given power to bind the serpent but it's going to take a take a deeper sincerity said God will forg he says and brother B says now God forgive me for my insinc or my insincerity and let me have sincerity and when I raised up my hands to him there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like the whole body was charged with something and I looked at the serpent and it started towards me and he he couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent he said a blue smoke flew out of him and he cured up he made a sign like an s a capital S backwards like an N sign that which means bind this one or anything below him church if we're going to be a Victorious church if we're going to see cancer defeated we're going to see homes restored we're going to see the pews filled we're going to see our way where young people on fire for God then it's going to take a greater sincerity cuz you can bind him and anything below him you can bind him and any disease any Affliction any spirit that would try to slip its way in you can bind it and he also the angel of the Lord or the spirit of God told brother man just so you know you can also un unbind him so not only church do you have the power to bind but you have the power to unbind it and let that thing loose but it takes a greater sincerity brother B say he woke up from the dream he went and got his Bible and he flipped over to First Corinthians he goes when you come to the feast the feast which a fast and the bodies the feast with the Lord he said we know that so when you come to the feast don't come with old leaven leav of malice notice malice and so forth come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth just exactly what he had told me in the vision come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that is the word then he says and I seen what he meant so brother Bram at one point in his ministry was so captivated by The Miracles and was the signs and the Wonders and he was constantly having a vision having a vision having a vision having a Vision having a vision having a vision but it's going to take more than that to catch the rainbow trout it's G to take the word can I tell you you are the rainbow trout so if a prophet of God had to be more SE to to bind the serpent what about us we can't bind him just by believing claiming that we're Believers claiming that we believe God sent a prophet claiming that we believe the message of the hour we can't bind him we still having desires of the things of the world in our heart the only way we can bind the serpent him the worst or anything below him is to have a life that's sincere and Joshua calls the men of Israel choose you this day notice he didn't put it off to 2026 he didn't put it off to May when you have your special meetings he didn't put it off to Wednesday night when it was just going to be a you know maybe our Wednesday night services we don't put so much credit or Credence on them like we do Sunday morning no no no every service is equally the same that's right Joshua says choose you this day whom you're going to serve choose for yourselves in verse 15 choose for yourselves this day whom you're going to serve so it comes down individually it doesn't depend on who your what church you attend who your pastor is who your parents are choose ose your C you can't kick the can down the road any longer God's calling for a total separation of unbelief and he says if it seems evil to serve the Lord if it's so evil to serve the Lord then you got a choice the god of the amorites the god of the Egyptians oh you can serve Tera gods that were on the other side of the flood see CU Joshua knew you're going to serve something there's not one of us here that's not serving something we make something a God you can make your career a God you can make your money a God you can make your car a God your house a God your spouse a God but there's only one God the Bible says in Matthew 6:24 no man can serve two masters notice it says for either he will hate one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve God and man so we find that we have to make a choice and I I'm gonna try to get in try to get through some of this see Joshua made a decision me and my house see Joshua had a history he had a relationship brother Thomas he knew what it meant to serve God he knew what it meant to follow under Moses and be obedient to a pastor though maybe he didn't understand all of moses' thinking and all of his theology he trusted that the god that spoke to Moses was still his God and he was going to follow Moses no matter where Moses was told to go Joshua was going to follow Joshua was going to be in obedience and when it came time for the ministry to come off of Moses and to come on the Joshua Joshua just stepped right into it he didn't kick against it he didn't harp against see Joshua decision meant that all hesitation was gone his decision meant that he lived above all the evil influences of the others his decision was deep it was calm it was clear it was fixed it was well grounded and it was solemnly made he look and he made his decision openly this wasn't something he' done in a closet he wanted all of Israel to know for me and for my house we're going to serve God for me and my kids and my wife we're going to serve God see he has served God his whole life and brother B says I can't make your decision I can only pray for you you have to make your decision let me hurry this on up cuz I want to get to the dream brother says judgment begins at the house of God we're in the house of God tonight you got to make your decision you got to make your decision whether you'll come to Christ or whether you'll turn him down every sinner in here has got to make a decision right now you'll either go out that door better man or woman than you came in or you'll go out worse than you was when you come in you can't stand mediocre tonight you got to make it hey this is on my heart he said it was on my heart but now it's on your hands you got to make your decision you got to make a decision maybe you've been a good church member maybe you've always longed that always longed that you wanted more of God you might have wanted to do something for God remember you're only mortal once that one time was the only time you're going to be mortal this may be the time that you got to make your decision you're either going to move up with God or stay where you are you may have to make your decision tonight Every Man Has a choice every man is governed by some passion some guiding principle some philosophy which becomes his God he's governed he's going to serve serve this flesh and this flesh becomes a God to us our desires of success and money and career becomes a God to us wealth Fame you know brother Brandon was warn women money and popularity tries to get everybody especially the preachers but notice in verse 23 Joshua 24:2 now therefore notice where they're in the promised land mind you they're in the opening of the word brother Thomas the messes of the hour they're there wake up I'm GNA be just about another 15 20 minutes some of y'all drifting off just hold tight notice Joshua says now therefore put away said he the strange Gods you're telling me they're in the promised land of the opening of the word and some of them are still serving strange gods in their homes nobody knows about it private little gods that they're serving some of them are still idolators and or idolatry excuse me and and and they're doing it in secret and Joshua by the inspiration of God as he gives his fairwell message choose you this day but if you're gon to choose God then you got to put all these false gods away you got to put all this other away or it may not be exposed in the service but you're doing it at home God's a temper somebody cross you you fly off like a bullfrog eating Buckshot God's of passion God's of pride and arrogance can't be corrected by nobody much less correction of the word feel like you're too big too good God's a bitterness gods of unforgiveness gods of jealousy gods of grudges gods of Envy gods of resentment but man God's done so much but yet you got these little Gods these little things in your heart heart that you're holding on to I'm bringing it to a close don't worry let's here in Hebrews 12 ver4 follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fall by the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you bitterness is Extreme wickedness especially they call it poison it's bitterness directly traced to the failure to forgive of it makes you costic sarcastic condemning and nasty how many's raising your hand I want to be bitter no you don't be costic nasty bitterness is anger that is fermented in the hearts of those that will not forgive and that thing becomes a god oh you're sitting in the presence Supernatural all around but it a little God that I'm serving I want to let go of I'm holding ONN to this hurt I'm holding on to this bitterness it gives me a sense of power gives me a sense of purpose of belonging brother says get all these little differences away from your little isms little funny feelings around you from your brethren oh well I thought that was you being mean brother Joon I'm telling you what the prophet said around you for Brethren and things like that shake it away don't let no root of biters ever get into your soul if you do it will caner you brother says also he said inmer church he said a root of bitterness defiles many then there's God's of jealousy and jealousy is a complex emotion that evolves feelings of insecurity fear and anxiety notice Cain everything we're talking about we take it back to the Bible Cain slew his brother at the altar at the altar worshiping God he slays his brother on the altar because of jealousy and some of us we look at what this one has and we be jealous or maybe favor that this one has belongings things material things or even spiritual ual growth Revelation and if we're not careful we become jealous can I tell you what the jealousy does to your body though let me just show you some things jealousy places strain on the heart palpitations may be felt jealousy stimulates sympathetic nervous system hormones like adrenaline are released to promote flight or fight responses jealous emotions quickly show on our faces ooo You Can't Hide let me tell you people know when Joe Adams ain't happy it's all over my body I'm like oh I hate that that's when sometimes I just stay at home Alone brother Brad it's just best don't even go because it shows notice what it says jealousy now I wasn't saying I was jealous I'm just saying there's times I just want to be by myself there's times we don't have good days people okay jealously displays in frowns narrow eyes pressed lips flare nostrils clinched Jaws none of y'all have ever been there Cher thems right all of y'all got your wings on got them tucked in your purse and you're sitting on them so you don't fly away right now studies reveal that jealousy places stress on the immune system chronic stress also lowers immunity by reducing white blood cells to fight infection suppressed immunity immunity from jealousy makes people more susceptible to colds flu other illnesses viruses like the Epstein bar that causes a fatigue may also reactivate old injuries and pain can flare up due to weakness of defenses due to [Music] jealousy a little God nobody knows about it but man your face sure shows it your body still shows it wonder why you got all those ailments and all that sickness and all that come now ever can get well oh but I'm in the promised land put away the gods God's a grudges let's look at another one I got 15 minutes I'm gonna try to hit that cuz I got a long drive Leviticus 19:17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart woo praise God Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart well where should we hate him don't hate your brother don't hate him in your heart don't hate him in your home don't hate him at church don't hate him when you're alone don't hate your brother love your neighbor pray for those that despite use you notice Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon Him Thou shalt not avenge Thou shalt not avenge that means you ain't got to talk about it you ain't got to run them down brother said if somebody done you wrong don't mention it you don't have to avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord so what is a grudge persistent feeling of ill will resentment resulting from a past insult or injury so let's just look at what grudges do to us is this okay it snares you in anger and makes you more prone to persistent renumeration rather than moving forward with your life when you got a grudge you just keep going over it and you keep grinding it and you keep grinding it and you keep and you look at that per and you you know the flares the Jaws tighten nostril flare eyebrows all that stuff we just read about that's what happens when you're holding on to a grudge you just live it and live it and replay it and replay it and replay it and replay it Grudge inhibit your ability to cope with or resolve your issue and keeps you stuck in the past now I started this message and Joshua started this message out by showing you all that God has done all the great victories all the great Miracles where he's placed you now we're in the word and he's telling us we must put away these strange Gods foreign God grudges are foreign to Lord bitterness is forign to the Lord notice also Grudge holding can adversely impact your mental health and you wonder why some people are stupid they let go of that Grudge it impacts your mental health I knew y'all thought that'd be funny I just slipped that in there for you that's that's Louisiana that's cjun talk sometimes we wonder how can people be like that cuz they stupid it makes you feel angrier grudges I know nobody's in here has ever lost sleep because you replayed that scenario over and over and over and over right nobody oh my well praise God we're not a perfect church are we notice now instead of accepting and moving on from a negative experience or finding an acceptable resolution holding on can trap you in the loop of resentment of bitterness of hopelessness of emptiness of an enragement simply put harboring negative feelings naturally makes you more exposed to those more unpleasant emotions and thoughts which can skew your mindset toward negativity either slowly or with a swift shift any focus on negativity can damper your overall well-being as I said Wednesday night you know there's just some people you just don't want to be around they're so negative now let's look at the god of Envy this one we don't talk about very much do we Envy is a feeling of discontentment or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions qualities luck desire to have a quality possession or other desirable attributes belonging to someone else and if we're not careful the devil will take your eyes of off how God has blessed you personally how he's blessed your family how he's blessed your home how he's blessed your marriage and he's got you pointing over here looking at somebody else my brother so and so drove up in a new Ford well big deal you got your children his kids are wer you're worried about his forward he's looking at your kids wishing he could have the same kind of family that you got Envy Envy a god of Envy never satisfied with what God has done for us always looking always looking always comparing comparing Ministry comparing talents comparing I wish I could sing like this one God put you to sing the way you sing to bless the people the way you bless the people notice Envy like other feelings may be experienced in a various uh and and it intensifies in various ways it may be considered beny uh which sometimes in comparison motivates us to improve our lives sometimes it can be destructive where all that you do is compare yourself to the next person let me just tell you serving God is not a competition it's not a competition little God of Envy let's kick it out of a heart then there's God's of resentment feelings that increases stress levels chronic sleep deprivation is associated with the multitude of health problems including obesity diabetes cognitive impairment all because of resentment you resent somebody so much can I tell you when you have bitterness envy and jealousy resentment crudes you're not hurting the other individual you are actually physically spiritually hurting yourself so now I come to the part of the message to where God gave me the dream I had a dream 3 o'clock 3:30 I believe it was Saturday morning I woke up Sunday morning and this dream it was so vivid it's a dream names and faces we will not tell it's a dream my daughter and I Rebecca were having dinner with a pastor and his wife the wife made mention of something that some of the young people had said about her husband about his preaching about the church and I looked at her and I said you just have to let those things go you know they're young people they don't know what they're talking about and her response was they heard it from someone where they must have heard it from their parents and my response was they may have heard it and they may have said it but you have to choose to let it go you have a choice well how you going to respond and as I finished my plate of food and I was about to walk out our husband walk back into the room and he could not sit down and have the meal with us because he was so tore up because of what was said to so tore up brother Thomas with bitterness and anger and jealousy and bear in mind this pastor had a lot of health issues cancer in his body heart trouble things his body failing him because something happened to his church church went through a split and he's never been able to move from that split in he's hurt and it's all he preaches about is his hurt all his focus is that church and as me and my wife now know me and my daughter Rebecca got up to leave as I was walking out the door he made a comment brother Tommy says let's just keep this between us and I was walking and he had an outside staircase I was walking down and I looked back at him and I said I know how you feel more than you realize how well do I know how you feel and what you're experiencing and I looked at him and I said I have been hurt but I choose to go on I have been wronged by Men by churchmen by Brothers but I chose not to hold it against them I have felt the pain and the agony of bitterness in resentment but I chose to forgive see I chose not to hold on to bitterness and I was walking down I kept looking at and said I chose not to hold on to the bitterness I chose not to hold on to the jealousy I choose not to hold on to the resentment and and the malice I choose not to hold on to the wrongs and keep reminding them of what they've done I choose to forgive and I choose to serve the Lord I choose not to die holding on the things that I shouldn't be holding on to and my last words to him was I choose to live I choose to live to live free from bitterness to live victorious in the promised land of the word to live with no resentment toward anybody or anything to live without any malice or any grief or any jealousy over anything that's been done or any recount Joshua still the people and he said choose you this day whom you're going to serve we're going to look here in Deuteronomy as I bring this to a close Deuteronomy 30:9 I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursings therefore choose life therefore choose like and brother Bron makes a statement here in by faith Moses he said A man was given the privilege to choose one he desired and so it is today you're given a privilege as free moral agents to choose whatever you want to choose my advice to you is don't look at the modern things around you the popularity the glamour that you could be but choose rather by faith him and give the promise that someday he will come and righten all the wrongs and will give you eternal life and raise you up as I am musicians if you would come Joshua for me and I don't want you to look at me when I say this as a preacher but for me and for my family I choose to serve the Lord for me and for my family I'm going on with God and he's reminded and if that's the case if you are then you got to put these other things away now as we start this New Year if you know that song draw me draw me Lord y know that maybe not just play something here Josh was about to cross off the scene stricken in age but he made a declaration to all men to all leaders to all the families I'm going to serve the Lord this church can empty out but I'm going to serve the Lord there may not be another church invite me to their Church to preach but I'm going to serve the Lord I may not have a friend left in the world but I'm going to serve the Lord for me and my family me and my family we got to make a decision and some of you have been hurt some of you have been betrayed some of you have felt wronged and been wronged by people [Music] but what are you going to choose this morning who are you going to choose this morning what's going to be your choice in this Service choose you choose you this day young people quit going through the motions choose you this day I'm going to serve God I'm going to serve the Lord I wonder if there'd be a leader in their house another Joshua would stand up said brother joob for me and my family we're going to serve the Lord there's another Joshua won't you just make your way down to the AL of Joshua make a claim for your family make a claim we're going to serve the Lord this new year we're not going to look back at past failures we're not going to look back at past grudges we're not going to look back at those that have wronged us we're not going to look back at our mistakes and
