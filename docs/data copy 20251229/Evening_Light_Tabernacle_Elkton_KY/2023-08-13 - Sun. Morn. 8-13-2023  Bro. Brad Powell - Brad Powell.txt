========================================

foreign to the book of Ephesians chapter 1. we'll read chapter or verses 1 through 14. oh yeah we can beat this mess for Sunday school sorry about that all an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of our God to to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ foreign having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace having Maine knowed unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself thank you in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were silled with that Holy Spirit of promise and the last one together which in the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory brother Brian or after reading them 14 verses what are you worried about this morning if God is faithful to save you and keep you you don't have anything to worry about this morning not to say that in a natural sense you don't worry about things I mean you're human beings I'm a human being sometimes the devil puts tries to put stuff on you but you have to take words this morning and if God is faithful in all his house and we really don't have anything to worry about uh if you return with me to uh Second Corinthians the second and third chapter this morning you know I spent three hours in my study this morning and I have a blind page here so we'll just have to trust the Lord this morning you know I am talking about myself here I find myself I don't I'm you know I'm just about 64. I'll be 64 in a week and you know as you're a young young man I don't know why I'm saying this as a young man you know you see your father your natural father and you see the traits you see his good traits and you see his bear traits and you say I don't ever want my father's bad traits I just want these good traits and then you get to be 64 and you realize that if you're not careful you're going to be just like your dad and my father's one of his traits as he got older is that for no reason at all just the littlest things would set him off and I find myself I'm raising my hand I'm telling all myself I don't know why but Pete knows sometimes would just be the littlest things and all of a sudden I I find myself just like my dad I lose lose control and get angry about things that I shouldn't be getting angry about but as you read that scripture those 14 verses if God is faithful and more than able to meet your needs he's more than able to keep my anger and my my own nature my this sinful nature in control through his salvation and the grace he gives us each day but I was reading the second chapter this morning you know I I use that devotional every day I'm sure you all have it well I can never I just wind up reading I wind up reading the Bible before you're supposed to finish it at the end of the year so I'm already in Corinthians and I was reading the second chapter this morning and the second chapter goes back to the first book of Corinthians where God was correct in the church through Paul he was correct in all the things that were wrong in the Corinthian Church and then we read the second chapter before we go into the third chapter and I'll just read a few of these I'll probably read this whole chapter like but Paul says here but I've determined this which myself that I would not come again to you in heaviness so he's he's changing here he's already corrected them he sent correction to him and he starts with the second verse for if I make ye sorry who is he then maketh me glad but the same which is made Sorrow by me and I write this same on to you least when I came I should have sorrow for them to whom I ought to Rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy the joy of you all for out of much Affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears not that you should be grieved but you should know the love which I've more abundantly on to you so he's saying the things he wrote were hard in the First Corinthians the things he was doing to correct the church but he's now he's talking to him in love and understanding here and I lost my place but it's fifth verse but if Annie have cause of grief he have not grieved me but in part that I may not overcharge you on sufficient that such a man as this punishment was inflicted of many so they're talking about how we put the young man out and others out of the church for their sins and then he goes on to talk to him and he finishes this chapter with Brotherly Love here he says so that counterwise you ought to rather forgive him comfort him least perhaps as one should be swallowed up without over much sorrow so they're saying once he's corrected you should return on to him in love and understanding for I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him for this to this end also did I write that I might know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things to whom you forgive anything I forgive also for if I forgave anything to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ so he's talking about brotherly forgiveness brotherly love that we have for each other in Christ and he starts at this 11th verse here Lee Satan should get any advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices so I was Paul he Paul is saying here when when correction is given as the father gives to a son or daughter or you know as things as you correct to each other after that correction is taken or even yourself when we fuss with each other and have issues with each other and once we make those issues right and those things right when you if something happens in your life and something different happens if your media thought is to go years back to the things that were wrong to you years ago then that's your enemy doing that to you if you've made everything right for the blood of Jesus Christ and you're moving on there shouldn't be any remembrance of those things anymore and if you find yourself or if I find myself always wrong to remember something that had happened 15 20 30 years ago and keep bringing it up again and again the issue is more with me than it was with the other people around me and he finishes here furthermore when I came to my pronunciations are going to be off to True is to preach Christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the Lord I have no rest in my spirit because I found not Titus my brother but taking leave of them I went forth hence into Macedonia now thanks beyond the god which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and make Manifest this the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place for we are unto God a sweet savior of God send them better saved and in them that are perished and this is really important Christians should be sweet not better or hard Christians should be loving and careful they shouldn't be deceitful it's total opposite here and for the Finish is here for under god I've read that already the 16th verse to the one we are fear of death unto death to the other the savior of Life onto life and who is sufficient for these things for we are not as many as which corrupt the word of God but as sincerity but as of God in the sight of God speak we in Christ and I was just thinking this morning I don't really have a lot to say I know that's a thing I say all the time I don't mean to but as we were reading in Ephesians as I was reading in these chapters I know one thing as I get older that God is faithful I've said that I say that a lot but I know that God is faithful and what he started in you this morning he's more than able to finish and and I was just thinking the world is a crazy place that we live in and the only only how do I say it the the only uh sanity that you'll have in this world or we live in is in Jesus Christ this morning that's your our only hope is in Jesus Christ all the things that go on in the world all the things that go on in the church I mean it should bring us closer to Jesus Christ this morning and I was listening to a message this morning and I was I was reading also brother Brian I mean even in the devotional was talking about the difference between a real believer and the church were all out there you know your pastor just shouldn't have to coddle you and push you and pry you to do what's right from the relationship that you have in your heart and in your life should make you want to do those things it's it's not law I don't I don't know how to say it's not law but when God gets a hold of your heart and gets a hold of your life to do the things that God wants you to think on a tour anymore it's something you just out of your heart and sweetness want to do or whatever whatever it is you know you know I've all the messages brother Brian I'm taught he said the most important thing for any man or any woman is to learn his place learn what God has desired you to be whether that's a preacher whether that's a Sunday school teacher whether that's a plumber or whatever it is and whatever God has chosen you to be if if you'll be happy in the things that you do if you're doing what God wants some people they never find those things out in their lives are always struggling but in this age that we live in a Christian shouldn't be struggling in the age that we live and not to say that there isn't struggles in the world but if if you're on God's path and you'll walk in his path this morning that should be a comforting thought this morning for a Christian to know that God is leading and guiding you in the world that we live in there there's no Shadows Of Shadows in your walk it's all bright and opening for you this morning and like I said I I say this a lot I can't say it enough as Christians this morning everything that we possess will ever possess has been given to us in the word of God in Jesus Christ and the message of the hour and as you reach for more of it and as you desire more of it God will make you more stable make you more loving make you a better Christian that's the only way you get better is staying in God's word but you know God's word is great but you have to have the very presence of Jesus Christ in your heart and life or it's just words without you got to have both you can't have one or the other it's all balanced in the word of God this morning brother David thank you amen you love the Lord this morning I stand this morning and sing that little course Oh How I Love Jesus this morning don't you just love him this morning I just to be in his presence this

very much and and uh we're gonna miss you but God bless you pray the Lord gives him a good year in school and just pray that just pray for him you know and I just I just really I've watched him grow up too and I think Lord and I used to call him peanut and he always said why don't you calling me that I said I don't know it always just fits you but he's grown in to be a fine young man and appreciate him very much a good Christian example just really appreciate him this morning and appreciate his guitar playing and us to serve the Lord so let's stand this morning oh wait a minute because Thomas it's yours man praise the Lord God is good I just want to give a little report amen and some of also some things that Amy man some changes maybe that we want to make to the church here amen structurally amen so I asked brother branches to let me do the financials report on the church so amen we'll start with first of all sister releases no brother John amen he says we would like to say thank you to everyone that came to the shower yesterday and to those that send gifts but couldn't make it as well it was a great turnout and it meant so much a special thank you to our family that worked so hard to make it happen as well they all did an awesome job and we really appreciate it brother John and sister Alicia y'all made me proud to be part of this church family amen everybody God bless you from everyone amen praise the Lord amen would you pray that the Lord if you're traveling mercies to all those that are at Ohio camp and probably traveling back today to God be with them in a special way amen I think we'll probably have maybe some music just before amen turn it over to Brother Brad then but hey man I want to start with just the financial status of the church amen and that is and now just to start from the top here amen uh and I'll come down to the bottom it says uh the total using the total amount of months to pay the loan by eight uh 20 30 because that's when our principal would be due amen or that's how long the loan was for till 2030. there could have been as much as 92 400 left to pay if not paying large amounts on the principal the last couple of three years amen and I know I think brother Byron said that for a few years he did pay extra on the church and for some reason I thought I don't know if we were going through a tight spot or what but amen I said I guess we decided just to not pay extra so that was stupid on my part amen but anyway but anyway so the total Principle as of July 2022 which was last year was 71 107 36 dollars amen and from that time to 723 of this year or July July the 23rd the total amount used from the general fund amen was 19 500. amen and of that amount was seven thousand five hundred that we had taken for uh you know and remember we took an offering last year for the to put on the principal amen and so there was 7 500 amen included in that amen so we got 19 000 paid there amen also from that same time period total amount of building fund that was used was fourteen thousand two hundred fifty six and then the church sale of six eight Acres uh six acres uh it says that it netted a payment uh on the principal of thirty six thousand amen and then of course the insurance check amen casabus had kind of planned on taking one more loan or one more offering from y'all amen this year but the insurance check that we got from the flood that we had inside of the building here ended up being four thousand eight hundred and eighteen dollars amen and we do appreciate each and everyone that helped amen get it cleaned get it back to normal amen but they uh and so forth um so adding all of the above payments together in the total that we had paid was seventy four thousand five hundred and seventy five dollars so what I'm saying is the church is paid for amen [Music] [Applause] that's good amen so it says the church loan was cleared on 7 21 So within that I guess about a year's time we paid 470 the Lord the Lord blessed us amen the Lord had mercy we credited all to God isn't that right that we could pay within the years time 74 000 and get this paid for amen so that puts us about seven years ahead we could have done better than that if I wouldn't have done what I did or whatever but Amendment we just praise God for that isn't that right so it's paid in full amen so and then I read of course I had read the last part if we wouldn't have done it that way I mean we could still at this point oh ninety two thousand dollars so praise God we don't isn't that right thank everybody for your giving your generous giving and I was thankful that I knew that with that uh the water damage and so forth I knew it wouldn't have to ask another uh another offering from y'all because you all are a very very giving group of people amen and I trust that God and I believe God really blesses you for that amen praise the Lord so amen we're very thankful for what God has done for this church over the last 15 years amen I kind of hesitated on saying this but whenever statements are made or whatever the devil tries to say things you know I believe that when God comes contrary to that I believe it's worthy of saying I know it was said that this church would never be finished it would never be finished if you make a statement like that and God finishes I think that we ought to say you were wrong God finished it amen God finished his church not only finished it but we got a 39 000 Paving that God gives us amen God bless us with pavement I mean I mean remembers coming up in gravel and I was like I don't know if we'll ever get any pavement amen but God it's just good it's all God it's not us not me and you it's all God folks amen and I love God for that amen don't you amen so praise the Lord for what he has done amen and so and I thought about owning my own testimony of myself and amen God given me a farm out there you know and 38 acres and it's paid for amen so praise the Lord now some of that loan is put over on my uh apartments up in town so it's not I'm not all yeah pull the wool over your eyes but amen part of that loan is up there but it's Amen wealth taken well down and God's been good hasn't he amen amen you talk about a testimony I'll tell you what you mean I asked the Lord I said sure be nice to live in the country and have a little you know a little stream about that why it may be of a spring going down through there you know I go down there and give me one with a big old fish and a big old Creek y'all saw it and they got this exceedingly abundantly but all we can ask isn't that right so praise the Lord now brother Brian I I want to give another hand to Brother Brian sister Jeanette amen they've gotten a wonderful job in in in taking care of the finances for the last 15 years thank you brother Brian for all that you do he is an impeccable secretary amen God bless you we sure appreciate it man appreciate all of you amen so it says amen God is faithful and on time in everything his people need and desire for his kingdom amen that's the truth amen amen so here's the note that little red thing up there paid in full paid to phrase the law thank you Lord [Applause] Amen Brother Brad here done a couple weeks ago came to me and he had some ideas amen for them proving The church here and so we talked to the trustees and deacons about it as far as I know everybody I mean he's on board with it amen and so we're going to go over a few of the things that we'd like to make changes with him and one of them is this poll but now we've had this in mind and it was funny he brought that up but Amen to bring this Pulpit out amen about right up even with this uh uh with this communion table Amen to where I'm closer to you amen would that be all right y'all like the effort maybe just having this part coming out of level it so we're a little bit closer to you amen I thought that so might be a good good thing to do and so uh brother back you know mentioned and I thought yeah that's be wonderful and then uh of course we want to get uh all of the Windows darkened tint it amen and I think we've already got a price on it but the Reds at sixteen hundred dollars or something like that amen roughly for doing that because once we get the fast internet here as soon as we get the fast internet here we want to put a camera up there I think and then the camera back there and say get some much better cameras up here so that aiming people can see better and so forth amen so I mean that's going to be you know run into some money for some good cameras and then also lighting we want to do re-lighting brother bed I sure appreciate he can mention some of the thing maybe when he gets up but he's gonna he's already checked into more lighting so whether lighting is just going to be better and and gonna be right I mean also amen for our internet and so forth and then the third thing also I think it was and then we may uh we plan on putting bringing that out and build a little uh uh extension of The Sound Room out there by wherever the Steve is we might have bring it out to where the people in The Sound Room they just really can't get the sound right uh and it'll also make more room back there because and then with uh uh with an operator for our internet system I mean we need a little more room so we may bring that out a little bit right there okay and then if you would Micah put a pull a couple pictures up if you will Brother Brad and them got some uh they trotted out on paper and so he took a picture but I mean not quite as good as it would be on the picture if you saw the paper but this is what we're thinking because this light back here as you can tell this window is still just way too bright amen so we're gonna have we're thinking about maybe putting some rock like that back there with the cross on the back how do y'all like that y'all like that pretty good raise your hand yeah that's good all right so I thought that's really good amen that was a good idea and uh what else on board oh yeah the other picture there you go yeah there it is and I kind of I've been to churches where they had all of these out down here and I'll be honest with you I didn't like it because I don't want a dead shirt I don't want to just so dead that if you sin you can't even hear the congregation saying and I at first I was like well I don't want any because Sherry law fantaine said this is the best acoustic she's ever heard in here I take her as a pretty good source but it does have some rebounds so I don't think some of them would hurt if you did put some of them so we may end up putting some of these uh uh sound boards up against the wall here in the back amen and it would look good don't you think I would be all right if you choose to do that all right so that's kind of what we have in mind Amen Brother Brad I can think of anything else you can mention it but appreciate Brother Brad amen and amen his ideas and so forth and his labor of love here amen how many appreciate you brother Brad God bless you assistant [Applause] yeah man a couple of things maybe we'll mention before we get into the word I guess we'll be done with music how's that but uh brother Byler covered about everything but just the Lord just kind of laid it on it on my heart to to mention those things just just to try the sanctuary uh more accommodating to to the people here um and and I think it would be more um like I said just more accommodating some of the other things maybe we'll look at in the future we've talked to brother Micah and oh I'm not on Emma yeah we'll get that fixed how's that hopefully on now so a couple of things that uh brother Micah you know working the sound it's a constant it's a I've talked to sound men all over you know different churches different events different uh Productions and stuff and and it's a constant battle with sound uh so a couple other things that we may look at in the future and talking to the sound people and and different musicians is in in-ear monitors for our musicians um that'll help with with brother Michael being able to control the sound because they they get if they can't hear themselves they can't play so if uh you know if if the drummer can't hear herself he's gonna hit the drums harder which then over rides the piano and then the piano can't hear herself so she's gonna hit the keys harder and it's just a constant battle so within-ear monitors they'll be able to hear themselves uh and he can adjust what they hear through the through the sound I know it's getting kind of technical I'm not trying to be that way but I think we can get a better uh you know atmosphere or Ambiance with the sound in the sanctuary as you can control it more and that's the whole purpose of the lighting the the windows is is the more control we have in this in the back back there to control the environment you can make it more what you want it to be uh so trying to eliminate some of those things and um you know we're we're looking at maybe doing some uh wireless mic systems and stuff as well uh to kind of update I think some of those mics have probably been here since uh probably the days of Noah does anybody still have a large telephone at home no we're living in a technology age and and we've kind of we've outgrown some of this stuff just time you know creatures of time and we don't think about it but uh it'd be a be real nice to have uh wireless mics on a stand that you can just hand them out or or they're ready to go so those are just little upgrades of things that we're looking at and it'll take time but uh we're thankful for what the Lord has done for us uh what he's doing today and what he's going to do for us in the future so if you would stand with me and we'll get into the word this morning let's just uh let's just go before the Lord and change the atmosphere a little bit if we could and go before the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we just thankful Lord to be in your house this morning and we come to worship you with our whole hearts and bring our our fire Lake of Fire together Lord that we could just bring it and and just ask Lord that you would move in our midst in a mighty way this morning Lord that you would lead us guide us and direct us to say what you would have said Lord that you would allow me to step myself out of the way and that you would step into shoe leather this morning Lord and speak to our hearts Lord and make our ears receptive Lord to the word and take away all tiredness we know it's been busy week and it's been hot and and the weariness may be of the people but Lord in your presence there is no tiredness in your presence there is no weariness and in your presence there's only love and joy and and peace and forgiveness and and Lord we just ask that that Spirit would fall amongst us this morning Lord and draw Us close to you as the word Goes Forth Lord may have been to bring honor and glory to you and we just want to tell you we love you and appreciate you for all you've done for us the the wonderful testimony of the church being paid and just what a testimony it is to the Saints here that that give and labor and and want to see the the furtherance of God's program and we just want to give thanks to you and to all that that give in those ways we just want to tell you we love you as we go to the word now bless the service in Jesus name amen amen if you would this morning as you turn into your Bibles let's go to the Book of Joshua and I've got notes kind of scattered everywhere but we can get with it go to the Book of Joshua and I'm going to read you a quote while you're turning there and finding that listen to this quote as the prophet speaks here he says that's my desire brethren to see my church cross over into another land that's his desire to see my church cross over into another land a desire to move over to the other side if there's something in you here talking about here calling there is something to respond to that call just settling down to sheep raisin ain't enough for you just to go into some sort of business is not enough for you to just to join a church and put your name on a book it's not enough for you because there's something called on across the ridge Over Yonder across the next Ridge and across the Jordan until you fall into the arms of God and took it can you wait for that day can you hardly wait for that day when you fall into the arms of God Almighty the day when you make it and you finally cross over onto the other side and a translation takes place and you just fall in the arms of your true love he said Yonder there is a deep calling unto the Deep turn with me for Joshua chapter 1 we'll begin to read there now after the death of Moses some of these scriptures I've used in the last sermon but uh we'll just kind of go over some of them now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even the children of Israel every place every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses so at this point right here everything that the prophet Moses was promised it's now promised here back to the children of Israel everything that Moses could possess everything that he did all of his works all of them the ministry and the works and the greatness of the hour it's now promised to the children of Israel so for the children of Israel now there will be no surprises of what their expectations should be because it's all been laid out before him and he says from the Wilderness and the Lebanon to this Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and into the great sea towards going down of the sun shall be your Coast listen now there shall not be any man able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee again if he was with Moses he's with the children of Israel if he was with the prophet in this hour he's with the children of God in this hour nothing's changed I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee watch what he says be strong and of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto the fathers to give them only be only be thou strong and very courageous don't let no hindering spirits come amongst you only be strong only be courageous and thou mayest observe to do according to all the laws which Moses my servant commanded the etern not from it to the right or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with orsoever thou goest this book of law shall not depart out of thy mouth but shall be shalt but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night and thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then shall have good success have not I commanded thee question mark so somewhere down the line where sin be strong be courageous be strong be courageous and Joshua and his mind must have been contemplating how all this is going to come together because God says it again have I not commanded thee for the third or fourth time be strong and of good courage Don't Be Afraid why are you doubting why do we doubt as Believers if there's really going to be a Rapture if we can really see Miracles why do we doubt these things and God is telling Joshua be strong have good courage Be not Afraid neither be dismayed don't worry don't worry for the Lord thy God is with thee we're so with so ever thou goest you may have your seats may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word now we begin to look at this and we begin to look at this I want you to turn back into your scriptures a few pages back into the book of Deuteronomy now I'm going to try to slow down I don't have a lot of notes and we've taken up some time this morning so I'm going to try to try to take my time but yet still get where we need to be the book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy chapter 34. in verse 9 I want you to follow here what's happening and Joshua the son of nine was full of the spirit was full of the spirit when I look in my Bible there's a little asterisk there a little note and when it says that was the Holy Spirit so Joshua now has come into the full fullness of the spirit and you remember back several Services ago when I preached it come to my attention and we shared how David stood in the midst of his brothers as a boy and even even though he was a shepherd He was out in the fields and he was learning how to be a how to be a a true man of God he was learning as a young man it wasn't until he was in the midst of his brothers and Samuel the prophet came down and took the Horn of oil and poured it over David's head and that's when the next scripture is says and the spirit of the Lord was upon David from that time forward you remember that here's Joshua is now full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of Israel hearkened unto him and did as the Lord commanded Moses and watch now there and there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses whom the Lord knew face to face could I say in this hour there has never been or never will be another Prophet to come on the scene that knows the Lord Jesus Christ and God Almighty and the way the prophet of the hour did face to face he preached the word of God he walked and everywhere he took and and stood there was an angel of the Lord standing beside him to protect him to watch him to lead him to guide him to tell him what to say what to do what not to do and there will never be another one on the face of the Earth to do that are you with me and all the signs and all the Wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to his land we seen signs and wonders Time After Time After Time we read and we hear and we see the witness and the testimonies of what happened in the message of the hour for the prophet of our day just as Moses there were signs and wonders in Egypt and everything that happened there and here Israel was a witness to all this and I want to continue my thought from last time when I preached on Kingdom Builders but this morning I want to take and I want to look at the focus more on the life of Joshua and the transfer of leadership and authority and and I think it's important that we realize you're gonna have to put on your spiritual glasses today and because last time when I hit on this in the last service I'll be honest I I hit a little resistance I had a little resistance because we don't like it when people begin to uh take the profit or and not not the critical is not the word but we take the prophet or the message and we begin to compare it in a contrast and we think that we're we're uh putting this down that's not what we're doing at all we're taking the message of the hour and we're going to step into that message that he brought just as Moses had a message to a people of Israel when Moses left the scene and he was dead that message continued to go on and there had to be a group of people that would take that message not only take it and and and look at it but they would live that message and we have to in this hour live this message and brother baller made a statement of last service or go or so uh so ago and he said we are becoming the bride and when I heard him say that I thought man that's that's good how simple that is but that is so good because we are becoming the Bride of Jesus Christ everything that the message of the hour was sent to us for we're beginning to step into it just like Joshua when he heard the message of Moses there was going to be a land on the other side of that River and the children of Israel will possess it and Joshua looked at that and he said I can see it and brothers and sisters we have to get it into our minds that we can step in and see where we should be in the message of the hour just as Moses and Joshua you can undoubtedly see the pattern of the message of the hour let me read you this quote there was an old Pentecostal generation that raised up 40 years ago old Fighters they was called they organized they beat they fussed he said all down through there but finally we're at the river now how many believes we're at the beyond the river now we're we're time to cross over something's fixing to happen and he says we're at the river now and he says he is going to raise up a new one with a Joshua to take them over the law failed Moses went with it Moses failed but Joshua took them over we find out that the organizations has failed but the spirit of God Joshua he says the word Joshua means Jesus our savior that the holy spirit will come into the church not an organization but the holy spirit will get among the people yeah the holy spirit will get amongst the people listen now and make her ready to go up across the Jordan brother sisters the holy spirit is what we need more of today we need the Holy Spirit to come down and lead us and guide us and direct us and walk beside us and tell us our do's and don'ts that says and not says we need the Holy Spirit like like the prophets talking about here he says and God knows that's what I'm seeking now that I might Comfort his people and tell them the what is at hand both here listen now both here this morning and out through the lands where these tapes will go worldwide he said we're at the end time Moses the prophet Moses the prophet here let the children of Israel of slavery in Egypt and brought them to the edge of the Promised Land and in the Old Testament the Old Testament mentions mentions Moses 767 times making him the most prominent name of people in the Old Testament that only David is mentioned more than he is in the entire book only David and Jesus is mentioned more than Moses in the entire Bible and so here we see how important the ministry of Moses was are you looking through your spiritual glasses Abraham we could look and say he's the ancestral father of Israel but when you talk about Moses he is considered the founder of Israel because he was the one who established Israel as a nation and Moses's Ministry goes out to the to a whole large group of people and it says you got to come out of her you come out of her you come out of Egypt your God is calling you to come to a higher place and the same thing is happening in our day there's a message of the hour that says come out of her because I am forming a bride there is a group of people who is going to become a bride of Jesus Christ Moses you look at it he's the author of The Books five books the pizza took and he he's got these first five books in the Bible the last four of those book Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy are all about his life that's how important Moses was a lot of times we hear Moses we think of a few simple things but as you begin to dig into it you realize that there was a whole lot more going on in those books that maybe we just didn't fully grasp because we read through so fast and Moses was so important there and so he is an author of these books and while Moses didn't write the Ten Commandments Moses did bring them down off of Mount Sinai let me tell you there was a prophet in the hour he may not have wrote the church A's book The Seven Seals marriage and divorce serpent seed he may not have wrote those from himself but I'll tell you heard from one who he was able to bring them down to a group of people that would change the way we walked the way we live the way we Act you know people want to contradict they want to they want to sometimes confront our message and they want to know how is this right how is that right what's over here what's over there what do you mean how is serpency show it to me and you try to show it to him and they still conflict you and I I told you before but I want to get to I get to the place where I just say show me something better show me something that makes more sense scripturally when you go from Genesis to Revelations than what the message of the hour says show me something better they can't show it to you they don't know what they're talking they don't know they just can't grasp that there was a messenger in this last day that brought it forth you know the Bible says and speaks about uh you know uh Malachi Malachi 4 you know there's denominations in churches they believe that they read that scripture but they don't know who it is they don't know if it's happened if it hasn't happened who it will be where it will be they're still looking they're still grasping what's going to happen to those people when the Rapture takes place they're going to be left behind because they cannot see with the message of this hour is so Moses considered one of the most important prophets of his day I consider ours the most important prophet of the hour and numbers it tells us that Moses was a man that was very meek and he was Meek and he was above uh men uh uh most humble on the face of the Earth how many could say that we've seen a humble servant in this hour we've got a lot that we can type back if here and we can continue to go on them now listen I thought about this here's Moses Moses's job as a mediator was to stand before God and Israel because the children of Israel at that time they had seen all these great wonders they had seen all the Miracles they had seen power they'd seen fire they had seen the demonstration of of God in action on the scene I mean what would you think if you went out there and God tells you to leave and pulls you up to a to a seabed and you can't cross and all of a sudden walls of water to a hundred feet go up on each side of you and you walk across on dry land what would you think would that place a little bit of fear in you because they didn't know of a savior at that time they didn't know of Jesus Christ they were just following what God was telling to do follow this Pillar of Fire follow this Cloud by day of Fire by night and they were following this and they see all this and magnitude so Moses had to stand before the people and God because they were afraid to talk to God now let me say this we'd have somebody come down in this age to tell us that there is one mediator between man and God and that's Jesus Christ he brought a message of the hour that told us that no matter how powerful God is all the things that God can do he's not there to use that power against his bride but God loves his bride God adores his bride God cherishes his bride and that's what the prophet of the hour consent was sent to mediate between us as far as us and Jesus Christ and the bumper between God he explained it all when he talked about that blood barrier and that bumper that stands before us Moses was a representative of the people of Israel whenever they had disputes they turned to Moses to learn the will of God you ever sit and listened to questions and answers on marriage and divorce there was somebody there to lay it out because people didn't know people didn't know what do we do I've been married before what do I do what do I do here now where do I go how do we conduct our lives from this point on and the problem said let me tell you how this needs to be according to God this is what we're going to do so there was a there was God standing there and he was representing the people of this hour through a prophet in this hour there's a direct connection Moses had with God there was a direct connection that he knew God will so well that Moses could look down and he could he could take the will of God and teach it to people did you ever realize that we're talking about slaves we're talking about Farmers mud daubers that's trying to figure out how are we going to get to God's Promised Land and Moses stand in such a connection but with God that he can begin to explain and say hey this is the way God operates in our hour we've had that in our hour that God can tell us exactly how we're to operate how we're to act in this hour he gives us the word and clarifies it he begins to teach and we've got ministers that are preaching the message of the hour in its fullness around the world to prepare a bride for a christ so here's Moses here's Moses now and Joshua Moses is getting ready to pass the Baton Moses knows because God's told him you're nearing your time you're not going to see you're not going to see what all you've preached about and you're nearing your time it's time for you to pass the Baton on to Joshua one thing I picked up as a young person when I was listening to the message I when I first started listening to the message I started in the last year there and I started and I began to listen because I want to hear what what was happening at the end of the ministry and one thing I picked up on is brother random I feel like knew that his time was drawn near if you've listened to him in the messages he'll begin to tell you I'm feeling I'm feeling like the time is drawing close I need to get this done I'm running out of time if I just follow through the message you'll hear there was something Quince there was something on the inside of him that was telling him get the people ready get all that you need to say out there everything that I've told you minister to the people and get the word out there so that they have it Moses had ministered all the word and he was getting ready to pass the Baton off to Joseph to Joshua and so if you've ever watched Olympic runners in a relay race they've got one on their mind it's the guy who was running at the beginning he's going to pass the Baton off to the guy who's going to what finish the race they've got one thing in mind and that is win that race but it's not easy they say passing the Baton is one of the hardest things to do in sports you've got two Elite athletes that are running full speed as fast as they can go and getting ready to pass a stick the guy running away from him and it takes communication it takes precision and so that is why we had such a precise message in this hour there was such Precision in the message of the hour that it leads nothing to question the scriptures are filled with this guidance in this delicate task of of passing the Baton Moses we know he prepared Joshua to be the leader of Israel Elijah he he passed the the John the Baptist prepared the Jews for the coming of Jesus Jesus the Messiah trained up 12 to evangelize the world and Paul set writings in place to teach Timothy how to preach constantly there's a passing down the Baton and in this hour the prophet opened up the word for the bride of Christ in our day we see that Moses affirms Joshua Moses looks at Joshua he says I Believe In You Joshua I trust in you Joshua I have confidence in you Joshua and Moses he looks there God's chosen to liver who marched millions of Jews across the sandy desert From Slavery to Freedom and Moses who took young Joshua and prepared it to lead the Jews across the Jordan into the promised land he instilled confidence and vision and Joshua how many has a vision this morning would you have had that Vision had it not been for a Ministry now but we've had a vision instilled in Us in this hour of a bride of a bride that will be without spot and wrinkle of a bride who will prepare herself Joshua and Caleb back up just a little bit they go over and enter in spying out the land and they set their eyes on what's to come we've heard about it we've heard it preached about we've heard it told about we've been listening listening to this message for year after year after year and they've been telling us there's a promised land to come and now I've laid my eyes on it and they sit there and they lay their eyes on and they bring back goodness from the land and you know how to all the spies and all those people Joshua and Caleb were the only two that thought that this was doable they're the only two that thought hey we can do this the rest of them saw obstacles and let me tell you this morning we have obstacles all in our path but we have to look through our spiritual eyes our Supernatural eyes and get the vision that the prophet gave us that there will be a translation in the moment and a twinkling of an eye and there will be a group of people that will translate out of here before you can even blink your eyes that has to be your vision this morning and there's seriousness that comes around that vision Moses he looks out here and he talks to he's he's got Joshua on his mind and he's looking and Joshua goes and spies out this land and comes back well at that time if you look in your Bible his name was O'Shea Joshua ocean and it meant salvation and as it began to go on and Moses begins to look at him and Moses begins to see Joshua's faith and he sees his determination and his commitment to the cause and he sees this passion that has Brewing up any Moses now begins if you look in your Bible changes his name to Joshua which means Jesus is our salvation what an amazing thing something has happened now Joshua now has become something that God has prepared to prove to us that there is a day coming there is a Salvation there's a translation that God is on the move and he looks at this and Joshua begins to witness firsthand the power and the glory of God Joshua was with Moses side by side watching and learning and taking it all in and he's beginning to see all of this and he's he's loving what he's seeing he Marvels at Moses's shining face when he comes down off the mountain and Moses pours into his successor I don't know anybody that suffered and poured out more than the message Prophet messenger of our hour he poured it out was it for monetary Gain No he could have been a multi-multi-multi-millionaire and he tore up check after check after check he could have had a flooded Cadillacs more than Elvis ever thought about it but he cared not for it he had one thing on his mind the people that will take a rapture Joshua marveled at Moses's face and and Joshua he knew when it was time for him to come forth and he knew them he began to look at that and God began to speak to him in a different way now here's one of the twists here's where the story twists now scripture says after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord he said unto Joshua Moses my servant is dead when he looks at Joshua and says that to him what he is saying is Joshua you are no longer a spectator in my plan you're no longer just going to be around the goodness of the message of the hour I'm now calling you Joshua to be a participator you're going to be a leader you're going to be somebody who takes the message of the hour and makes the message of the hour live all these people are getting ready to cross over the river and I'm about to give them all these people are getting ready and they need somebody I want you to know that everywhere you set your feet you will possess Moses had confidence that somebody could carry it on and Moses laid his hands on Joshua right before he died and prayed over him and the Spirit come upon Joshua brothers and sisters I think sometimes we get so focused on what's happened in years past that we sometimes fail to see that God can trust us to carry out his work in this present day we come to church we go to work we go to school we go to our jobs we we find ourselves around the message but are we Allowing God to fully use us are you doing don't raise your hand but ask yourself in your heart am I doing all that God wants me to do am I living the life that God is asking me to live to take and make this rapture in the message turn on the light the prophet said it seems strange to us now because we keep looking back through a rear view mirror he said but did you ever know if you keep looking back that way you'll wreck pay attention young drivers if you continue to look behind you see what God is going to do in your present day you're going to find yourself running off in the ditch and he said that's what they're doing he said the reason that they did that is because we're living in they're living in the glare of another light they're living in a glare of a light of another day the children of Israel had just continued to sit there on the banks of river listen now if they had just continued to sit there on the banks of that River day after day after day saying God sent a prophet named Moses don't don't resist don't don't resist I mean what I'm about to say because this is what they'll take to get us through what if you what if they just sat there day after day and said you know God sent a prophet named Moses I remember when Moses walked into Pharaoh's Palace I'm going to tell my grandkids about when Moses called down the plagues it was such a joyous occasion when when we crossed over the Red Sea with pharaoh and Pharaoh's Army was devoured at the Red Sea let me tell you brothers and sisters if that would have been as far as they went and stopped when Moses died they would still be sitting on that bank at the Jordan River today but it took somebody it took a group of Believers that would listen to the message of the hour Joshua that picked up right where Moses left off and said I'll take every word that he said I'll take every message that he preached I'll take every Vision that he had and I'm going to look it through my eyes through the spirit of God and I'm going to walk in those shoes God is looking for a group of people that will apply the message of this hour personally in our homes he's looking for a group of people who will have a vision to be able to be on the other side of that River who will take a translation you've got to see it for yourself I love the message the message changed my life it changed my home it changed my children it changed my my relationship with people the message of the hour teaches us it teaches us how to live it teaches us how to conduct business it teaches us how to live in our homes when our wife is in disarray it teaches us to put on an apron and wash dishes that's the Simplicity of the message of the hour that teaches us how to live a life that's pleasing to my God almighty he says that's what's the matter with the world today friends he said we're trying to live in a glare of a light that's shines in another day and he says like a mirage on the road he said we go down the road and we see the Mirage it's just a false conception of the Sun now stay with me here don't get critical I'm not saying the message is a mirage that's not what I'm saying but what I'm saying is a lot of times we find ourselves still to this day living a life that the prophet lived instead of living the life of God through us the preaching of the word is focused in One Direction and one time 1950s through the 60s we've got to come up higher not that there's more of the message not that there's more to it but we've got to accept it and we've got to live it and we got to make it our life he says let me tell you don't refuse the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is the warming rays of the Holy Ghost upon you it makes you a new creation in Christ don't walk in the glare of some other age he said it may have been all right then it might have been all right for them and he says I say this with reverence and respect listen but to bring light because as our brother said a while ago we're living later than we think one of these days something's going to happen and it's going to be too late the people will take on the mark of the beast not even knowing what they're doing the blind will lead the blind they'll fall in the ditch and is living later than we think listen now but the hour is at hand when the light is shining [Music] we're living in the hour and it's at hand when the light is shining Christ and Jesus Christ is fixing to do greater things than we've ever seen in our life [Music] he's going to listen what he says he says it's the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ manifesting himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you say well that's simple we've heard that do we believe it do we still believe that miracles happen do we still believe that cancers can fall off do we still believe that Dad can raise do we still believe that deaf ears can be opened don't don't lie to yourself do you believe it because God has to have a people that stands on that word and said with all my heart I know that God is able and that no man no Spirit no demon can stand before me as I was with Moses as I was with brother Brown I will be with my people foreign he said if the church won't accept it God is able for these stockings to rise up and he said he's going to get his message over because he's always done it and he always will do it listen we're fixing to get down in some gritty here because people think they're walking people thinking they're walking in the light the traditions of their fathers uh oh uh oh my daddy this my daddy was here he traveled from one side of the country to the other to hear the message that's what your daddy did that's what your granddaddy did he allotted this for this day he said the first thing you know they're walking in the glare of light they're not in the same light they've rejected the very light that they claim to be worshiping turn with me in the Book of Numbers if you would chapter 32. I didn't give you my title I guess now would be a good time while you're turning if I was to title this it would be Kingdom Builders Joshua and the two and a half what are you talking about I could see that look coming from his face what are you talking about Joshua and the two and a half chapter 32 of numbers verse 1. now the children of Reuben and the children of God had very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jezer and the land of Gili that behold there was a place for cattle the children of God and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses the elies are the priests and unto the princes of the congregation saying Nebo and Beyond even the country which the Lord spoke before the congregation of Israel is a land for cattle and watch what the request is and thy servants have cattle wherefore they said if we have found Grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over Jordan wow can you imagine sitting in a church in the message of the hour and say I know I'm part of this group I've heard the message I've heard the word I know all about it I know everything there is to know that it's a possible and I believe every bit of it but because I need to gain my house I need personal gain in my house can I just settle over here and live like a world on the other side of Jordan the rest of you can go on over two and a half tribes Manassas again and Reuben's tribe half of Manassas two and a half tribes wanted to settle on the east side of the Jordan River because they wanted to raise cattle but listen to what they did and this is where we get into trouble they went across the river they promised Moses when Moses was living they promised said it when the time comes if you'll let us possess this land on the east side and raise our cattle when the time comes for battle and the rest of the children of Israel go over to take the land we'll fight with you isn't that the way the borderline believer is okay Christians today they want to see the Rapture of the church come to pass they truly believe that it's going to happen they've heard it since they were this big and they know in their hearts that it's going to happen but what they want don't want to do they want don't want to live in the center of God's will these two and a half tribes didn't want to live in the center of God's will they wanted their own way they want we want to raise our cattle look at the grasses over here look at look at how this prosperous look at the pastures over here cattle will grow will Thrive over here so Moses just let us live over here they didn't want to sacrifice their Comforts or their Pleasures to see the will of God accomplished and brothers and sisters that's a dangerous place to live that is a dangerous place to live because as you begin to dig deeper and deeper into this and you begin to see that the tribe of rube and again and Manassas they tried to justify this they said we will we'll construct a a replica altar to God we'll have a place of worship and we're going to we're going to construct this altar over here and we'll worship it and we want to construct this altar because we don't want the rest of the children of Israel to forget about us we don't want them to forget that we were part of the message of the hour we don't want them to to forget that we're part of that Covenant people and if you find it in the scriptures you'll find that there was no rebuke nothing nothing was set harsh against them nobody corrected them Moses didn't rile up against them they just said okay as long as you'll fight with us you could have this land if that's what you want here you go but brothers and sisters I believe what happens to them is a warning it's a warning to those of us who are those around the message that just want to live on the fringes of God's will they want to live right there on the fringes of God as will and they don't want to make a full commitment to live in the center of where God wants them to be why did God let you hear the message so that you could play around the edges oh no he let you hear it because he cares he loves he wants you to see see you in that rapture so why are we playing around with it why do people play around the borders of Jordan when you look at the history these two and a half tribes you'll find that there was no Mighty Works done by the by these tribes after this point the tribes of Reuben and Manassas and gas there was no great works or deeds done there was no Mighty Warriors spoken of these of these two prophets of these tribes no prophets no Warriors hmm no mention of great events happening in their territory no words of Miracles no words of healings no words of Deliverance overcoming what happens to these people they simply begin to fade out of the record of God hmm brothers and sisters that's what will happen with the borderline believer they worse yep they'll pray they'll attend some special services when they're announced they'll show up and when it's convenient they'll acknowledge you God sent a prophet they'll say this Destiny for them on the border is to dwindle away and just like Reuben's tribe gads tribe and half of Manassas tribe they simply Fade Out of the manifested word of the hour do you think they still longed for the Miracles we're talking about the people that saw plagues come down on Egypt we're talking about people who who saw uh the rod of Moses turned into a serpent and devour The Magician's serpent we're talking about people who who saw the Red Sea part we're talking about people who saw fire and lightning come down and write and Stone The Ten Commandments and now they're just dwindling away from the message of the hour I don't want that to be my legacy you and I don't want that to be our Legacy I want the devil to know I was here I want the devil to breathe a sorrow relief when I leave here I want to get over there and I want to hear well done not what did you do how did you live you didn't you didn't inherit all I had for you um and then the funny thing is you watch how these borderline Believers are it's God's fault it says in the scripture they begin to blame God for separating them because there was a border the Jordan border between them and the other children of Israel God didn't do that that wasn't nothing God did God didn't come down and say because because of this I'm going to put this this River here God didn't do that they did that to themselves when they said we want the Comforts of this world we want the conveniences of this world we want the goodness of what's right here in this world they made the Border Reuben again they lost their identity from the rest of Israel even though they've been around the message their whole life and brothers and sisters that's the case when a part of a group separates themselves from the whole you want to know why it's so important to fellowship and worship in church because your fellowshipping and worshiping under the same Ministry everybody else you're not out here doing your own thing and thinking well this is okay or I can justify this or I don't have to do this because no you're sitting and listening under the same anointing and the word of God that everybody else is under but what you'll find is these people that's part of this group they get separated they'll develop different they start acting different they start letting things come into their life that they used to wouldn't do because they're living on the other side of the river I've seen this over and over and over and I'm sure brother Byler will attest to this people who are involved in church and commit their whole purpose to God their Christian walk is different than those that just come to church and say I'm a good message believer it's more than just being a good message believer there's a lot of good people that are not going to take a rapture [Music] but oftentimes they don't see the necessity to walk hand in hand with God they compromise that's the legacy of Reuben Gad and manasseth well that happens at least two and a half their choice left them with no barrier realize this their choice that they made left them with no uh military barrier between them and the enemy so here sets two and a half tribes of God's chosen people they should be on the other side of the river behind the walled Fortress they're sitting out there in the open for the enemy to come in and just take them one by one by one by one and that's the way the devil does us if he can separate us from the group and there's no border there's no wall there's no hedge that can be placed between you and your enemy Satan begins to come in and hit against to take your joy and your happiness and your peace and your marriage and your job and your children that's how important staying with the group and fellowshipping with God and being living on the other side of the river is I don't want to be like a Ruben a god of manasseth I don't want to settle for life on the other side of the Jordan there's no peace over there there's destruction over there instead I want to give all that I've got for God I want to sell out and the fullness into the presence of God's Will and and and I don't want to just look and say how far can I go before I'm out of the will of God because that's what a lot of people do they want to be right there I want to be in the will of God until he makes me do this I want to be in the will of God until he makes me change the way I live um [Music] let me tell you we're living in a Time I'm not going to be much longer we're living in a Time that we should be playing to win to win not playing not to lose you know there's a difference between playing not to lose and playing to win I wasn't going to tie names to this but I'm getting it we went and played golf here a while back okay and brother Josh brother Carson and brother Weston and we played golf and we paired up teams me and Weston took on Josh and Carson that's the right foursome right that's the way it was Carson said yep we pull into the last hole if you know anything about golf it's about how many strokes you can win how many you how many you're up and how many are down we pull into the last hole man Western pull up and we're one stroke down that means we got to make up two to win one to tie two to win and we pull up to the Tee Box and I watch and Carson's just getting started in his golf career so I love these opportunities to teach he pulls out a club that he hadn't been hitting well that day because he thought that was the safe safe Club to use now he's going to tell you that's not the case okay he's going to tell you if he used his other club he would hit it over the green that's what he's going to tell you but he pulls out a club and when I seen he pulled out I told Wes and I sit in my cart I said we got him he said what I said we got him I said he's playing not to lose and I'm playing to win I'm putting my ball on that green we're going to two putt for birdie he's going to miss his shot and they're going to Bogey and we win by one lo and behold shank to the right no pressure I think it was on Josh hit second he pulls his out of bounds I think into the driving range wake up Weston hits a ball I don't even know where he goes I wouldn't worry about it because I knew I was plan to win I hit my ball and Wesley said yep we got them it was flying just to straighten it's as pretty as you could a picture and it lands in front of the green by about a foot it rolls up there about between me and that drum set on a par four that's good if you don't know that [Applause] I know we don't have a lot of golfers in here so I have to help you out that's good they're hitting on another Tee Box from another hole and got about as long as a hit from the first shot to the second shot way one by one because I was playing to win and we're in a town in a time and a day when we don't have time to play around I'm not trying to just survive I'm going to be the first one in I'm going to be the one that's looking for the Rapture I'm going to be the one that fights every day of my life to make sure I make it there I'm not holding back any clubs I'm swinging with all I've got I'm gonna make that rapture we need more Joshua's in this hour we need more joshuas in this hour and the prophet said Joshua was a warrior and he was a commander to lead the Army and he said he stepped into a place where the great man like Moses stood he didn't step back around the edges and look and say I wished I could do this I wish the days of Miracles what was it wasn't passed no he said whatever Moses could do I can do listen to this he says Josh you're standing there that morning talking to God and God said I'll not fail thee as I was with Moses so shall I be with you he said I'll destroy and devour I'll make the way clear be strong be courageous be don't be dismayed listen to this he said he said we'll follow you he's talking to the children of Israel now he's talking about the children of Israel following Joseph Joshua like they was going to follow Moses he said that ought to be the requirement of every born-again person today that if we requested to follow and then let the signs follow the believer yeah if we're requested to follow this message then there will be a following of signs everywhere we go he said that's what Jesus said he said now Joshua had to take his command listen now he said oh how the church or to look this morning and find the spirit working amongst the people I've Got Confidence in the people in this church are we perfect no do we have thoughts and failures yes but I have confidence that if I have a need if I say there's a dire need in this situation will you pray I have confidence that we can see signs and wonders and miracles when this group of people pray and he says if you want to know it's a spirit that raised up Christ from the dead the holy spirit that will move amongst the people that's the spirit of that's what the spirit of God is raising up in the last days to take the people over and to the other land spirit of God is Raising it up he says and to the full promise of the blessings of God to a full commission that he gave and a promise talking about Kingdom Builders what kingdom are you building are you building your kingdom here are you like the two and a half or are you like Joshua which kingdom are you building he says we find Joshua takes this commission knowing the responsibilities was leading them through lands now they have to go over to the other land listen to what he said they have to do they'd have to set up their Kingdom Joshua has to go over there and set up his kingdom they have to divide the inheritances amongst them he said he knew the commission was tremendous we've got we've got a tremendous Commission in this last hour the words that I do shall you do also Greater Works than I do you know that that's a commission do you know how hard it is do you know it's impossible let me put it that way do you know it's impossible for a man to walk from this Dimension to the other dimension without the Holy Ghost it's impossible it cannot be done but you've been commissioned to do it you have to be like Joshua and grasp a hold of that commission he said he knew that it was tremendous far more than what Moses had done um okay Joshua had to do more than Moses had to do would you listen to these real quick and we're going to close Joshua he come to the end of the trail through the wilderness the prophet said Joshua stood there needing a bridge to cross over Jordan into the Promised Land he said God he needed a bridge but God provided a power not a bridge we will live with power and demonstration not on our works not what we can build ourselves not what our not what our social media can build us up or or what this or that or Tick Tock and all this not what all that stuff builds us but we will live and we will build our kingdom with power and demonstration he said he needed a bridge but God's way was power not a bridge he sent power and he held the river back and he walked across on dry land that was God's provided way not a bridge he had a better engineer he had a better engineer he said God likes to muddle things up I didn't say that he said it God likes to muddle things up and he likes to muddle things up to show himself God he said it was right in the springtime when summertime would have been so much better to cross this River sometimes we get in situations and predicaments in our life we think man why am I going through this at this time I I it would have been a whole lot better off if it would have been six months down the road I would have been born financially able I would have been healthier I would have had this I would have had that but he says God likes to muddle things up to show who he is and he said and and here he come in the right in the spring and one place he said the banks and Joshua was looking saying I got to get over there I got to get over there on the other side of that River he said but God let the whole valleys get filled up with water and then he come and pulled his great power down from heaven and made a dry road across it and one place they said the waters went back into the woods Into the Wilderness and stood up God is able God is capable we've heard testimonies in the last little bit we've heard testimonies of what God's done in the people here we've heard testimonies of what God's done for our church I like what what uh one brother said the lord giveth and the Lord give us again I never heard a scripture but we'll write it [Music] the lord giveth and the lord giveth again are you willing to grasp it this morning are you willing to take it and say I'm going to cross over Jordan I'm not going to be like that two and a half I'm not going to be like Manassas again I'm not going to be like Reuben that stands over there and gets comfortable in my own way of living but I'm going to take the way of the despised fear let's stand to our feet I know it was different this morning and and we've just had some really ministers coming through and brother Byler we've just had some pumped up services and it's to prepare you but sometimes we have to see where the rubber meets the road to make sure we check ourselves up and what you say well why do you why do you build us up and tear us down it's so that we make sure you don't miss it examine your life examine your heart make sure you're living where you need to live let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for this day we thank you for the word Lord we thank you for the examples you placed on our heart we we trust Lord with all of our heart that it was pleasing to you uh the examples that we we used and we felt you leading in this direction to draw us closer to you to make sure we're not living on the outside of that border of that river that we've made commitments and we've made dedications and we find ourselves in the word crossing over into the next stage not living in a days gone or a days past but in a in a living breathing message of this hour this day we're living in we don't want to be guilty of looking back and Wrecking Our Lives on a day's gone by but we're living in a day when there will be a Rapture to take place there will be a bride and it's got to become a reality to us and the vision has to be real and we have to see it with spiritual eyes and claim it just as Joshua claimed it that he could see on the other side and said there's something calling me to a to a place on the other side of that river that I can't be content in this world anymore and whatever it takes to get over there I'm gonna get there Lord make us more like you in this hour reveal more of your word to us Revelation Lord we love revelation of the of the word Lord Jesus word that draws us to you Lord we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you if there's anybody here that feels like they just need to make a A recommitment or a dedication to you Lord may they just by The Uplift in the hand say Lord accept my my plea Lord accept me and forgive me from where I failed you call to me Lord and continue to send that deep calling out that that my heart May respond to it Lord bless all those hands that's serious dedicated Hearts people that want to make it people that want to be on the on the other side of the river not content with the things of this world this world has no no hope no pleasure no peace but there is a kingdom that's that was built there's a kingdom that awaits us and we have to step into that Kingdom we love you Lord with all of our hearts in Jesus name we pray amen let's just uh sing a song I'm on my way to

time in the Lord amen and uh it's just been good to be in the house of the Lord and brother that's fine come up here and dismiss us this morning and greet the people if you'd like to come ahead buddy and we just kind of privileged to have brother Joshua's folks with us this morning and uh we'll just just so happy to have him this morning amen God bless you come ahead buddy oh praise be to Jesus he's in the house and he didn't leave huh thank you sister for that song I was very good well God is good to us isn't he all right well we were our brother was preaching and he was talking about the science and wonders that supposed to be with the Believers and we can testify to that um in our voting on an assembly in our own home we we actually had Miracle after Miracle just recently our own home uh sister Tracy my wife she had a tumor for years that was just awful and I mean that this thing was ugly and it was like over 16 pounds and anyway we um we set the Lord for healing and uh you know when you pray for healing you know you can't I know this is Elementary but you can't tell God what to do you pray for healing and you leave it in his hands and we're so blessed to have a message such as we have because it's so balanced right you know some people pray for healing God doesn't answer their way and they get upset with God okay not so that's rude and and that's immature but you know brother Brandon told us you know God has different ways to heal sometimes he heals by love I understand and sometimes he'll send you to a surgeon and God said that um we would go through surgery to take care of this thing but whatever way God prepares for you to have he'll open the doors and uh God opened so many doors for us and and then along the way there were Miracles that took place and we just give God the glory for that because he proves to us over and over that he is with us and we're just so thankful and I I know uh what whatever we go we can testify that there's other folks who have heard about it and yield testimonies are for one thing they're they're to strengthen our faith because when I hear what God did for a brother or a sister if I'm struggling with something that gives me courage hey if God can do it for them because they're Believers well God can do it for me too if I believe and we believe right so we get we bring you greetings from from where we come from
