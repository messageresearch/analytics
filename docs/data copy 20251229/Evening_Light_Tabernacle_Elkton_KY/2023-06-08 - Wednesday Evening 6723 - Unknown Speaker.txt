some a pot like we usually do just pot luck or whatever amen and we'll look have a look forward to having a good day a fellowship with one another amen and just uh being around one another amen so everybody that can come you're welcome we appreciating uh be nice to have you um if anybody wants to Camp let me know Friday night you can come Friday night and go down there amen and Camp got a couple of really sweet spots for camping if you like camping amen and listen to the coyotes at night and whatnot you know but anyway oh my praise the Lord but God bless you amen everybody loves the Lord amen praise the Lord amen we want to do a third part on the word and the power of the word of God Amen if we don't Fade Out that is amen we can't wait to get some better internet around here amen that's for sure amen but uh amen let's just bow our heads and go before the Lord in prayer father we come before you Lord Jesus we want to thank you Lord for one other wonderful day that you have given us Lord we thank you for all the good things that you have bestowed upon us Lord realizing God when we think back lord if our forefathers and the different ones back in the early 900 1900s Lord and we think of how people used to have it really really bad and rough we think sometimes we have it bad but we really don't in comparison so Lord help us to be thankful and grateful father for how good you are to us Lord and father to think also Lord Jesus of when we was in confusion and people still out there in darkness and in confusion spiritually not knowing where they are Lord you have brought the light of your father so that we can understand these things better father we ask God as we have assembled ourselves together Lord and come into those double doors Lord Jesus we ask God that you'd help each and every one of us not to go out the same Lord but to go out better than what we've come Lord not to be on the same condition as what we was when we came in Lord we ask your blessing upon the reading of the word the meditation of our heart and ask God that you just bring the inspiration now and help me say just what you want me to say and keep my mouth from saying anything Lord that where you wouldn't once said father let it be a blessing and edify the body of Christ for we ask it in the all-sufficient name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen if you will turn your Bibles amen we want to amen kind of go this is kind of one of those things where uh you know it's the same word of God same scriptures and all but it'll be something that I I just feel like perhaps maybe you know getting my age sometimes I think it's new maybe maybe it is maybe I've spoken on it before but anyway I don't think I have amen so amen it's kind of just something other something a little bit different angle perhaps I mean than what we're used to amen or or have seen maybe we can see it just a little bit different amen amen so I think we want to go to the Book of Matthew let's go to Matthew first amen just do a little lesson tonight with the help of the Lord the word of God Amen and the power of the word and how we can see the word amen in its full strength Amen in its full power amen and so I just want to read um in the 13th chapter of Matthew 1 through 9 and then I want to go to verse 18 to 23 of the same chapter it is the story or should we say the parable of the sower that went forth to sow verse 1. the same day when Jesus went Jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and the great multitude were gathered together unto him so that he went into his ship and sat and whole multitude stood on the shore and he spoke many things unto them in Parables saying behold A sower went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forth with they sprung up because they had not much deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because that they had no root they withered away then some fell among thorns and Thorns sprang up and choked them but other fell on into good ground and brought forth fruit and some 100 fold and some 60 and and some 30. he who has an ears to hear Let Him hear amen isn't it something that he said that but yet he had told him that he speak spoke to a lot of them in Parables showing that they seeing would not see him ears would not hear neither would they understand amen it takes the Holy Spirit to really reveal it now in verse 19 of the same chapter he begins to explain it verse 18. he hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when anyone Hearth the word of the Kingdom amen how many believes that's the word of God is that right the Bible one here is an understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which is sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the wayside but he that received the sea seed on Stony ground places the same you see that heareth the word and annoy with joy receiveth it yet he had not root in himself but do Earth for a while forming tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by He Is offended he also with received seed among the thorns and see that heareth the word and the cares of this world the world and the deceitfulness of riches choked the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that receive a seed in the good ground to see that heareth the word and understandeth it which also bears fruit and bringeth forth some 100 fold some 60 and some 30. may God add His blessings to reading in the words you can be seated tonight amen so we see here brothers and sisters that you know uh and and we speak so much and we do believe that whenever God sends forth his word Tommy believes it when God sends forth his word and when he speaks something it says that it will not return to him void amen it's Eternal in the heavens and it can't pass away and so forth and all of God promises that way but I want to look at something a little bit uh perhaps in a little bit different light and there's a whole world of uh whole message basically that we could preach on on the unconditional Covenant that Abraham had with God that God saved Abraham unconditionally isn't that right and so forth but tonight we want to speak on conditions conditions amen as you can see by the word of God that there were certain conditions isn't that right that the word fell into and it only brought forth a little or or it only sprung up so far it really didn't it doesn't sound like it really achieved what it was supposed to do isn't that right amen and so that that's true you know and that's the way it is and you know and ultimately we find that um you don't want to save that comment for later but anyway we find here that there's all these different different conditions that it falls on and on and and even Jesus said to uh I believe it was the Pharisees he says you know you by your Traditions have made the word of God of none effect to the people and we have to say that you know even though the word of God I mean every last word is true and every promise is right but yet most people do not benefit from it do they they never really reap the benefits of the word of God we want to tonight look at the conditions amen of reaping the full benefits of the word of God because notice he says that he wants us to bring forth fruit now let's talk about conditions I wanna I wanna I wanna I wanna name a bunch of conditions amen that there that comes with the word of God we're going to say that there's a bunch of conditions because I heard a preacher one say I don't give his word with conditions there's no conditions with his word I just didn't quite agree with it amen because there's conditions amen so one of the conditions I want to talk about of course is um one of the conditions is you have to be hungry hunger Hunger is a condition that right thirst is a condition right to come it's a condition whosoever will is a condition if the word if is a major condition remember when that one came to him and wanted healing for his daughter I believe it was and you know he says if thou if thou can't believe how many times did Jesus if thou can't believe that's the condition if you can amen if you can so we got the word if we'll get cover that a little bit and so forth amen another one is repent another one is water amen you know and so forth of course faith if thou can't belief faith is of course one of the major conditions you got to have faith to believe it I heard brother bam talking about faith and he says you know if you could just believe for anything ask anything just believe anything if you could really have faith for that what kind of world would it be what kind of world would you live in if you could just ask anything because the Bible says if you can believe it even if you have faith and don't doubt you'll have it but brother bam says he makes a statement he says you know the Holy Ghost won't give you faith to believe something that is according his word or according to his will isn't that right or according to his will the Holy Ghost won't so whatever Faith you have is just mental faith it ain't your faith is God's requiring amen so and I you know I thought about that because I know that we're saved unconditional God's going to save us and so forth but I want to say that even for us believer even for us Believers the word of God is on condition it's on condition all right I just want to start with saying that all right let's start with the first condition let's go all the way to the Book of Revelation let's look at this here first amen I'm sure we all could say tonight I want more of God I want more of the spirit well there's got to be more there you know but what what is what what's got to be there what Scott to be there if you're ever going to get more there has to be a deep calling right a deep calling to the Deep amen Revelation is 22 here's the first thing I want to talk about in Revelations the very end of the chapter how many remembers Jesus said whosoever will let him come in Iraq and the spirit verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is read it with me a thirst come so there's your condition you'll never come right unless you're thirsty so that's why I said the condition is that you've got to get thirsty before you get anything from God you're going to have to get thirsty amen all right and and whosoever will right let him take of the Water of Life freely now how many means that that's what this is this is the Water of Life this is the bread of life this is the Tree of Life and the Bible says if whoever wilts now how many knows whosoever will let him come that no uh John 3 16 for God so loved the world that whosoever Shall Believe in him should not there should everlasting life whosoever will and that will is right in there because people just don't really want it that's the problem because if that will was there for everybody everybody would be saved everybody gets saved if the will was there that's a big statement ain't it the whole world would get saved if the will was there Cain would have got saved if the will would have been there God made him the offer do like your brother and you'll be accepted did he want to he had not the will the Pharisees that have been saved if they had the will but they don't have the will oh [Music] Glory how much more I got a revelation of this body when I got to thinking about this God put it in such a way that this Bible is really just for believers they're not like it's really just for the Believers or real Believers the only one that's really going to just will he's the one that's gonna be thirsty he's the one that's gonna be hungry the others ain't hungry they're not thirsty so it's there for you pray pray be to God think about here's another one Matthew 5 there's so many things but blessed are the poor spirit and so forth but blessed Jesus said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst blessed are they for what does it say for they shall be failed Hallelujah oh my think about it oh my let me go back a little bit go back to the other thought well you know people say well I want to I want to I want to be Christian people come up developer perhaps but the question is how much do you want to how many knows that God knows how much you really want to are you really are you if you really will then you have to come with all the other ones you know what the other ones is Jesus said unless the person is willing to forsake all to follow me is that worthy of me so are you sure you want to do all that yeah for a sec oh it don't matter if you're married and your husband or your wife isn't going to come when you come guess what she might divorce you might put you away but that's what you got to be willing to do if Jesus said man those who have forsaken houses and lands and wives and children for my sake huh the same shall be saved so that will God knows and just the same with the Holy Ghost people will say well I tried and I tried and I tried I tried even better man said he said you know there's there's people that have tried to get the Holy Ghost and it just seems like people can manifest the word of God and others man you just can't do it huh isn't that how it is sometimes let me just read it his word is always what he wants to see Vindicated and it'll only be Vindicated upon certain conditions this is accepting God's way 1963. that's when you meet those conditions and you see people that can take the word of God and just make it live for them and others come right back with the same word and they can't do nothing with it it's on conditions whoa praise be to God can I read you some more again he says on the next quote it's on conditions absolutely you can have Divine Healing you can have salvation you can have the baptism in all he goes but that's on conditions that you meet God's conditions outside of that it's not for nobody but Believers that's about the right that's why we say that this is really a love letter to his church that's why all of these conditions we're talking about it it doesn't really apply to the unbeliever they'll never meet those conditions and if you meet those conditions if you will or if you are a thirst you blessed person if you want more of God if you want more of the holy God you are a blessed person that's why you guys say you're blessed if you're hungry and thirsty you want more God you're a blessed person because those people they're happy wherever they are whatever they're doing I'm not happy until I'm doing what God wants me to do together I'm not happy until I'm in the perfect will of God oh my I'm thirsty I mean these thirsts is another condition you got to be thirsty isn't that something could have said anything but he said let him that's a thirst come anybody that's thirsty come on come and drink of the Waters of Life freely amen takes me back to David isn't it something how David was a renowned person he was carnal he did a lot of bad things because of his flesh and lack of the Holy Ghost don't we all when we ain't got the Holy Ghost like we ought to David did but there was something else about David that God really liked and David was a consecrated man to God he'd repent that he's wrong and so forth and you know he had it his heart said on God and in Psalm 63 and 1 he says oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee amen praise the Lord oh my God let me just add this in how many knows and another condition amen of receiving God is that you seek God you might think I'm you know you're seeking God that's actually God working that's the grace of God pulling on you seek and you shall find hello no not giving unto you only will I seek thee my soul thirsts just for thee my flesh long for thee as the in a dry and thirsty land boil boy we can sure say that this place around here it's Troy this world is dry the Baptists are dry the Pentecostals are dry a lot of message churches are dry a lot of people are direct hey it's a dry land but I'm thirsty for water oh I tell you what ain't nothing like going out there and working in the hot sun and I'll tell you what amen I like little Anna little uh uh Elena Emil and I'll have them to go get me a big old glass of water it may give me some ice and I'll jump that whole thing down I love that water when I'm thirsty that's the way it is this church you come to church if you're all full you might not amen you may not want any but if you come to church Thursday you'll say oh let me jump some of that down go fill her up again praise be to God that's right we love to come on Wednesday night grab a hold of that big old glass and drink some more give me some more preaching preacher now oh I'm hungry give me some more hey man you love that all right trying first in word no water amen now notice to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary oh my that's what we hunger and thirst for is to see the power of God don't we power of God in your life power of God in my life to see him do Miracles so when you ask something he answers it don't you just love to be in the place another condition another condition forgetting what you want in Saint John 15 he said if huh if ye abide in me if you abide in me and my word abides in you then you can ask what you will in other words you've got to be right with God Christ has to be there Holy Ghost has to be there he has to be there because he said without me you can't do nothing you ain't getting nothing you ain't doing nothing you ain't gonna be the light of the world you ain't gonna be like to nobody you ain't gonna be your help for nobody talk before we get back flint and when we get sin in our life we get depressed we get down on ourselves and the devil will try to make us men feel bad about ourselves and if you feel bad about yourself everybody else is probably not want to be around you you can't let the devil do that who was it sister Lisa I think it said if he said something about that last time last Sunday in the on the special talking about the devil trying to beat you down I thought boy that's right I won't even give a testimony about it but I'll say it now the devil make you try to feel bad about you if you feel bad about yourself that's a terrible place to be get down on your knees and get right with God and feel good about yourself wear a smile it's so much better it's found so much better you love him that's right if you abide in me and I'm my word if if if if if if if if those are conditions because it's all possible think about it well we allowed to talk we always preach about all things impossible but if thou I can't believe then all things are possible if you can believe but that's the condition and half of the people don't get it weak a lot of times don't get it amen that's right preach it brother because we don't believe the way we should yeah I want to say it again can I better John Wayne that if we don't get what what you know a lot of time we think well God didn't give it to me God didn't give don't you ever blame God you blame yourself because if you blame God you're saying his word ain't true and his word is true he keeps his word when you think well God don't keep me let him just go ahead and show exactly why you didn't get what you wanted what you asked for and that right and you'll say oh boy it wasn't him at all was it amen while we're on that subject there's a scripture for it says it this way well Galatians 4 well it's in James no it's in James let's go to James I'll find James here amen James is way back here I need my tabs I stuck it downwards on below all right foot winds comes Wars and fightings among you come there dot hands for even from your own lust that war in your members isn't that the truth yeah all of our lusts and all of our desires and stuff that's where all of our problems come from you lust but you have not you kill you desire to have and you cannot obtain you fight in war that you have not because you asked not you ask and receive not because you ask a miss [Music] it's because the wrong thing my my you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your own lust you adulterers and adulterers know you that the Friendship of the world is inevity with God and whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God amen what is he saying here a lot of times we've got a load of our own selves in there yet amen still our own ways in there and then we want this and we ask that and we doubt we find we try to get it we don't never get it never get to where we're going never get what we want never we have asked because we ask for the wrong thing I believe it was said whenever brother Brandon was talking about that and how it said that you can't just ask for and he says you got to ask for the will of God you know and when you know that it's according to the will of God then ask and it'll be done amen yes sir praise the Lord you love him back to David again that thy power and our Glory another one uh brought up two pages back on if Psalms in 42 Paul says I mean that Paul David David says as the heart passes after the water Brooks so path of my soul your God my my soul thirst for God for the Living God When shall I come in appear before him amen so David said has the heart but the man of Peace shown this on Thursday isn't that right talking about a dewounded deer that man I've got to get to that water I'm gonna die how many that repent that boy you feel like you're not where you ought to be with God you just man you got to get back together the guy get to that water broke you got to get back to where the water's flowing again to where God's talking to you again oh when you get the first and like a deer that's on his death look I'll tell you when you get real sincere about it and that's just where we have to get most of the time that's the condition says bring us to the place that God becomes a reality it's called the place of desperation place of urgency the darkest hour that's when we get serious about it oh my I believe it was said when Zion just when Zion travailed then she brought forth amen you've got to get so serious about it I'm gonna kill you it's like having a baby travailing and paying Paul says I prevailing birth amen until Christ be formed in you without all just become a bit formal well we gotta go to church again Wednesday nights Wednesday night I guess we gotta go I'mma prick your heart I want to ask I want you to ask yourself how you felt about it when you realize hey it's time to get ready to go to church good good I hope if that's all of us because I realized sometimes on a Wednesday after working hard oh my is it really if I could just sit in this recliner you know how many believes that when you get like that it's time to not sit in the recliner but get down on your knees the Lord forgive me God lord it's a better sacrifice but I'm so worried I don't feel like it man everything else but it's a good sacrifice Lord help me to have the right attitude about this get my glad to be here is that right praise the Lord Tommy and Troy Amen Brother Steve different ones that drive over how far away amen gotta go home and get home by 9 30 10 o'clock I remember doing it down Dixon we go home and we drive an hour and 10 minutes every Wednesday we go all the time now right Mercy amen it's a good sacrifice everybody listening out there it's a good sacrifice but you got to be thirsty I thought about that minute I'm telling you what if we're ever going to get out of here and it isn't going to be because okay let me just say this a lot of times I wonder sometimes if we don't get so comfortable here that we just maybe stay a little longer I love my children I'm ready to go home aren't you this is just not the place for me it's getting too Wicked I'm uncomfortable here I'm gonna go where there's no death no sorrow no cancer no no arthritis no diabetes none of that stuff no pretty good days man down days and up days feel good and don't feel good and decided yet amen it's gonna be all good hey man are you gonna I'm telling you what we're gonna somehow our other can't believe God's gonna bring us to the place where we're ready to go God take us out we're going to be in travail we're going to be something for him become we're gonna be um thirst you want to get somewhere you gotta thirst got to have that thirst if you don't have that thirst ask for The Thirst say God forgive me for not having The Thirst like I should even brother Bennett said it I've said it many times over the pulpit but I heard him say it one time he says you know did you ever notice how the more you eat the next serving is bigger than the next serving is bigger yet folks I'll tell you what that Chinese restaurant I go in and I give me a plateful man I gotta get a second eye for a little bit of the second one you know half full I'll tell you to be honest with you a little bit more on the third one I'll go back to third time but I'm having a jewelry he said that's the same way spiritually maybe because you don't have a hunger and a search amen maybe your house starved you don't even have any hunger pains how many believe you need a spiritual hunger pain David said I fly so first free I'm hungry and I'm thirsty oh Lord I'm here amen and I want to be fed amen oh Lord I'm hungry and I wanna be fed when you get like that when you want moral God when you want to see more of God you'll get to see more of God you gotta want it whosoever will you have to desire it amen remember the first church age we want to be like the first church age remember they had a passion how many knows they had a passion that's what we got to have David has passionate amen deferment desire to please God the passion to know his word to cry for reaching out in the spirit amen oh my that's what we need more of how many please the Lord's he's going to take us back I don't know about you but I'm planning on I'm going back to the Garden of Eden I'm going back to the Garden of Eden before I go back to there I got to get back to the word the way Eve before she slumped it over amen praise the Lord thirst all right how many we cover hunger desire thirst you got to have a thirst amen got to be in travail so to speak travail foreign in travail Paul said for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaila in pain together until now amen and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit I mean at least that's what that means you got the Holy Ghost but you're also travailing you're also in pain what are we in pain we want to like Paul said until Christ is fully formed I don't know about you but I mean travail until the word is fully formed in me take this seed take this word Lord let it put it in it here and let it bring what a hundredfold isn't that right isn't that what we want to do we want this word to come in their lives and to be fruitful because that's exactly what Jesus asked in Saint John 15 that you bring much for bring forth much fruit that's the father's will is that you bring forth much fruit amen and this is the fruit tree praise be to God it's like a seed amen for we ourselves growing within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body amen so we have to be in travail to get what we want you have to travail sometimes ask seek and knock thirst come amen now notice better man I'm talking about Elijah and Elisha Elijah turned around he says the only thing that he wanted to know was talking about Elisha it was could he get that promise that's all he wanted and he says now I'm going to ask you or tell you what my desire is I want a double portion of your spirit to come upon me now what are you going to say basically he Elijah's telling Elijah and Elijah the anointed Prophet turned around and said thou Hast ask a hard thing but this will be given to you on a condition and so it's the Holy Ghost given to you on conditions see on conditions how many believe that well I want to get changed I'll believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and shall be saved well that's not all there is huh how many believes the Baptists they've shaped their hands or just just raise your hands believe on the Lord now you're saved if you truly believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you'll follow Acts 2. isn't that right you'll follow Acts 2 the Bible says repent every one of you what must we do to be saved repent every one of the condition is that you got to repent see the Baptist a lot of them died a lot of people think that they're going to go to heaven they're saved they're going to go to heaven with all their junk not gonna happen amen boy oh boy didn't that one man say to brother Brandon I'll tell you what I believe in I believe predestination and I can do whatever I want I'm saved now and you know I go paint the porn the town red and just go have me up well you can imagine go out there and get drunk and scream up and down the streets thinking he having a good time till the headache comes the next morning right but around says that shows that you aren't saved in the first place you ain't got in the first place if that's your attitude amen praise be to God that's right on conditions if you meet that condition of that Essence listen if you can see me while I go away you'll have what you've asked for that's all the light you want that wants to promise that's the way this is you and I all we really want is the promise just give me the promise I want the problem he wants promise we're not like you so he saw these Spies The Promise didn't he the birthright he despised that Birthright other people rather bam says you know there's a lot of days of Miracles is past there's no such a thing as the Holy Ghost it was only for this it didn't despise the bathroom then he spies the promises to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call now I want to say this when Acts 2 is met when a person goes and gets baptized huh all I do is baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come up and they're supposed to receive the Holy Ghost aren't they I can I do that can I give him the Holy Ghost no that's completely between them and God God knows if their repentance was genuine because brother bam says there's no waiting if that's repentance and that sacrifice is perfect in the right if the repentance is perfect God is obligated to you to give it to you right there and right then he goes on to say salvation healing I don't care what it is Deliverance whatever it is if God ever delivered anybody and he saved anybody on a certain condition if you will meet those conditions God will do it again I'll tell you what if a joke was ever on fire that church will have to meet that same conditions how many beliefs if we're ever going to be Acts 2 churches gotta be amen that we're always one Accord one mind one hour amen praise be to God you love him all right praise be the Lord now notice it's on any conditions absolutely you can have Divine Healing you can have salvation you can have the baptism in the Holy Ghost but it's on conditions you have to meet God's conditions I love that it's not for any unbelievers a man said to me that long ago a minister said I statements of raising the dead and everything else says I don't believe it I said certainly not it's not for unbelievers how many believe that that's exactly right this is not for unbelievers this is for believers oh ask a sinner out there do you believe that Jesus raised from the dead do you believe that if you believe in Christ amen you'll be sad no I don't believe that I seen in the news Arnold Schwarzenegger he said about heaven do you believe in heaven and he had that blankety liar that's what he called God called Heaven A blankety liar I thought woo old man about to die you know what I thought he's exactly right there is no Heaven probably for him there is no heaven for him the only thing he's gonna find is hell unless he repents which I would want Arnold to repent wouldn't you I wanted to see him saved but to say something like that amen same way with John Wayne he went out saying something very bad about God so forth not having any faith amen but does it surprise me brother not really because most of those people have sold their soul already to do what they do and the way that they are they have already sold their soul and they don't want they wouldn't want to believe it if you showed him I heard another people going out there he says show me proof show there you know they know from God I says let me give you a tape see what you think about that where God came down and Vindicated and proved himself let him give you a picture here's here's here's a picture the FBI and the government said it was real amen let me ask you something do you think they believe then Jesus at one place even though one would race from the dead an unbeliever still won't believe amen so how many believe this for this is for believers this is for you this is for me if you're a Believer you'll meet how many believes you'll meet these conditions now we may not only bring 30 folds some 60 folds and maybe some of us a hundredfold maybe you don't have all of the same Faith but how many beliefs if you'll believe it and you'll plant it in there and believe it it's for you it's for me how many slides salvation is mine brother Glenn healing is mine sister Sherry I'm healing is yours Hallelujah Towers happiness is mine Joy is mine the Holy Ghost is mine peace is mine Heaven Is Mine God Is Mine it's all mine I accept it the other condition I mean there's the other condition I want to speak on just a little bit and that is acceptance this book is a book of Pardon for the whole world whosoever will but you've got to will and you have to accept it like that uh that soldier that was shot you all remember after getting a pardon from Abraham Lincoln into the Supreme Court said you know a pardon is not a pardon unless it is accepted as a pardon this has to be accepted by the man says I don't care what promise of God I don't care if it's the Holy Ghost I don't care for the remission of your sins I don't care what promise of God in here he says the first thing you have to do if you ever got it is to accept it then it's already done acceptance is a condition you can't wander Maybe you have to be willing to be ate by a lion you have to be willing to be burnt in the fire isn't that right like the three Hebrew children they believe that if it's going to cost them their lives we're a blessed people folks I think sister Martha Donna said something about she's seen on there where they couldn't take pictures or something or whatever but those people are there they're looking at the cottage homes in Rome now and all them people there and he's the one thing that she said was that these people don't celebrate their birthdays they didn't celebrate their birthdays they celebrated their death days that's what she said I hope it's true I think it is but death days why because he said we're just now starting to live today is the day we're gonna start to live their birthdays were their death days they celebrated that I can see it I'd have probably been one of them bring them lines oh bring that power take me to heaven let me from limb to live that's right just claw right on you there with your big old teeth and get my heart racing let me go to heaven that's the way the Christians were back then amen celebrated their death day I mean you know that same devil is waking up that walk movement I don't think that's anything but the devil waking up getting ready for the Great Tribulation and to devour the woman's seed that is left here amen those who are left here after the Rapture takes place woe to them you'll have to give your life to say you're a message believer still that you believe in God amen all right that's right praise the Lord when you plant a seed in the ground what condition is there other than planting it in the ground and putting it there what's the other condition for it to ever grow you have to add water amen glory now I know one thing let me take you on a large scale there's a seed you are a seed how many of these you received and when the Holy Spirit comes around the preacher preaches a sermon or you read a book it doesn't matter isn't that right when that water comes down but the man says you look quick in that seat you're gonna bring it to life okay give me Serpent seated give me water baptism it can be the goddess it could be whatever but if you're a child of God if you're a city God when that Holy Spirit comes and anoints and wonders it it breaks forth I remember when I sprung forth huh Minecraft Sarasota isn't that right Pinecrest Sarasota that's right when they said man there's nobody ever been baptized any other wedding in the name of Jesus Christ I said where's the water let's go I want to be baptized come up out of the water sit on the bank and just wanted to float away sins were gone you asked me why I'm happy so I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone amen but if your sins aren't gone you ask me what upset because my sins aren't gone oh isn't that the truth he'll be sad if your sins aren't gone wash how many wants to be washed by the blood Washed by the Water of the word let that water come let the water better bam said one place I told you here Sunday I think go go in the spoken word of this Original Seed he got to talking about uh Billy Graham's Revival and all Robert's Revival and his own Revival being dead here in any of them he says what is it he says their seed is sown in my seed is sown now it's waiting for that last rain to come I don't know but I can just feel a little bit of that rain can't you tonight because I just haven't really been myself lately there's something going on huh I just haven't been myself there's something going on God is doing something I don't know about you but I believe it's time to eat the book eat the word in that Soul right in there so that when that rain comes that Rapture comes amen it'll manifest itself because he's got to be in some ground hey man I want every word I don't want to be one that goes by the wayside I don't want one that just comes so far praise be to God I believe it the next day but ain't nowhere to be found by the wayside of persecution tribulation problems whatever it might be oh I can't handle that come on you better have deeper root how many believe that tribulation and all that you better have deep a whole lot deeper rooting that you better have to be ready to go through the Briar Patch and then some amen do you ever did you ever honest Amish folks brother John you remember I don't know if they call it the brighter patch but they'd get two people two lines of people get on one side and they go like this and somebody have to walk through that you just get clobbered but you try to make it to the other side that's what they do for fun folks ah if you become a Christian you better be ready for that is that right the devil cloud are you upside down one or the other find out what you got it's a lot got a lot you love him that's right so it takes just that it takes accepting of God's word it takes water it takes feeding then but the Brown says man you neglect defeat the Holy Ghost you'll find yourself backslid you'll find yourself dead you'll die just as you you neglect of Milk The Cow shall go dry you neglect to turn a corner you'll wreck if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit that's in your heart not just Wednesdays and Sundays folks how many believe it amen every day all day amen feed on the word become the word how many beliefs would come to come in the world we are the word conditions yeah there's conditions profit clearly said that the Bible clearly says it if thou cans believe all things are possible amen amen praise the Lord amen aren't you glad to be pardoned how much glad to be pardoned I want to read a story in closing a story we well know but before I read it I want to read uh Revelations I want to read something about our pardon that we've received by the God's grace amen I may notice that whenever you uh are born into this world brother bam says a video starts so to speak in there right a machine begins to run and it records everything that you do and then we go through a different chapter so to speak of our life and it's called we have a book the book of your life everybody has a book we come to our final chapter our middle chapter this chapter that chapter it's important how many believes you want to have dude your best in every chapter amen because we was driving down the road taking a little ride country ride and a little buggy and we went by this one house and there was old man standing there on the porch he was standing there we go way nice he didn't wave at all he was just there in this Bay I bought dessert and I says I wonder if he ain't troubled I wonder if he ain't an old man that's got a lot of thoughts of his past that are troubling him because he sure doesn't seem to be very happy or friendly you know and I thought you know that's if we get older when folks get older you get more nervous you think about all that you've done all your life you begin to think about what you did in those chapters is that right aren't you glad to have him taken care of better brand them of course you all remember the story of him being in Ohio and preaching and so forth and and he went to a restaurant and uh he thought it was a restaurant but it ended up being a bar isn't that right and there's an old lady sitting there and so forth with a couple men you know with kind of painted you know and just terrible and he says God how my children have to be raised in this why don't you just wipe it off the map isn't that right and God took him in behind the door and I kept watching as I stood behind the door and I see my own sins come up and every time they would start to hit the throne the blood would act like a bumper car on a car it caught it neither and and I would see it shake and and the blood would run down his face and I seen him raised his hands and said father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing I seen myself do something else and he shook him again and bumped and God would have killed me right then but his blood was catching it it was holding my sins and I thought oh God did I do that surely it wasn't me but it was then it went walking like that like this like I was going through that room and I walked up close being there and it had my name on it all kinds of black things and sins and so forth wrote across it I said Lord I'm sorry I did this did my sins cause you to do that did I spin your blood around that world did I do this to you Lord I'm so sorry that I did it he reached out and I said will you forgive me I didn't mean to do it he says and I'll try to be a better boy if you'll just help me and he took his hand and patted his side took his finger and rode pardoned on my book and thrown it over behind him and to see if his forgetfulness watched every bit of it he says now but you wanted to condemn her see you're forgiven but what about her you want to blow her up you didn't want her to live I thought God forgive me I didn't mean to think like that I didn't want to do that amen he says you're forgiven you feel all right but what about her she needs it too she needs it well I thought not how did I know who you've called and who you haven't it's my business to speak to everyone amen Revelation said that I saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened the books were opened and another book was opened which was which is The Book of Life hey man how many trusts your name is in that book right there Edward judged out of those things which were written in the book books everybody has a book according to their works and as he gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in it and they were judged every man according to his works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire how many is glad tonight by the grace of God and by faith in Jesus Christ you've repented you've come met God's conditions and your sins have been erased pardoned has been wrote one day the devil might say oh what about him what's worse his book I don't have a book of him there's no record of his sins it all in the sea of forgetfulness how many is glad for that God bless you stand with me tonight thank you I don't know about you but I just say I believe I'm a Believer I believe God's going to do things but these things are on condition help me Lord to meet all those conditions if people were delivered they would have healing whatever it might be Lord grant me the faith to accept and receive that condition that is if thou can't believe amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you tonight Lord Jesus and we just ask God that you'd help us when we go out those doors that we wouldn't be in the same condition that we were when we come in Lord that we would understand your word better Lord Jesus and realizing God that the word of God it'll be dormant or dead so to speak unless it brings forth and is in good ground and it's in Fertile ground and the right condition the right Heart Lord Jesus you said in Saint John 15 that you wanted us to bring forth much fruit help us and increase our faith to believe in you that our light would shine Lord Jesus you said you are the light of the world father help us Lord to be right with you father and Lord to manifest you to the world Lord pick out all little sin any failures Lord Jesus that are here tonight we ask God as we raise our hands we say God forgive us Lord put them all in the sea of forgetfulness even as your Prophet said forgive us God forgive me we don't mean to think wrong but we do sometimes even the prophet even we as Christians sometimes we take the wrong attitude we take the wrong thought on things but help us always to think the right thoughts Lord Jesus and father I pray God you bless each and every one now in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you brother Joshua we know that song since I
