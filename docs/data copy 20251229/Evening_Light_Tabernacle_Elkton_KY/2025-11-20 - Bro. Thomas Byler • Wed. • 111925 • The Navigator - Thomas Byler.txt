And he laid something on my heart. So, amen. We'll see what the Lord will have in store for us. Amen. For this evening. Amen. Um, do remember, Amen. Sister Betty and them. Amen. And I know it's a really hard time right now, but Amen. Her soul is ready to go. Amen. We know if she goes, she'll be in a much better place. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads. Precious, kind heavenly father, as we come before you, Lord, once again, Lord, so grateful, Lord, to feel the warmth of your spirit in our hearts, Lord Jesus, knowing, Father, that you've are keeping your promise, that you said you'd never leave us nor forsake us, even to the end of the world, Lord. And Father, here we are at the end of the world, Lord. But you're still with to your people, Father. Lord, one of these days that he who letth will let until he be taken out of the way, Lord. And we know we've been taught that one day God will lift his spirit from the Gentiles, go back to the Jews, Lord. And we want don't want to be left here, Father, when that time comes. But we, Lord, we want to come up to glory to meet you in the air, Father. And we want to be ready, Lord, for that time. And that's what we come for, Lord Jesus. out of the depth of our heart, we want to thank you, Lord, for doing a work in our lives, Lord Jesus, and for being with us and for comforting us and and giving us light in this darkness, Lord Jesus. Giving us joy in the sorrow. Amen. And [snorts] give us understanding in all of the misunderstanding that's out there, Lord. Father, we could just go on and thank you, Father, for all that you do for us. We ask God that you'd help me get out of the way now Lord for your prophet taught that the real gift is to be able to get out of the way. So Lord help me to get out of your way Lord so that you can do what you do Father and that's to speak to your people. That's to minister to your people. That's to speak to hearts. That's to change lives Lord. And just Father we ask God that you just come now in a special way in Jesus name. And everybody said &gt;&gt; amen. Praise the Lord. Turn your Bibles if you will. We'll go to the book of Isaiah. Amen. And so this is kind of a new message, I guess, for me. Amen. And Amen. In my mind, we're going to get out of here about a quarter after 8. Amen. That's in my mind. I got it pre-planned. So, Amen. And remember that's me. So we'll just let the God have his way. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's hope it's not quarter after 9. Amen. Well, I maybe I shouldn't say that. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, some might wish or some might hope that it's not. Amen. But anyway, Isaiah 35. Isaiah 35. and verse eight and an highway shall be there. Amen. And there many songs have actually been right. I'm on highway to heaven. You realize that's actually not correct. &gt;&gt; It's actually incorrect according to the prophet. Amen. because he said and a way. Brother Ram clearly says that's a conjunction and all right there's a highway and then there's a way. Amen. And it shall be called the way of holiness. Amen. Amen. So the way is what we want. Amen. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those the wayfaring men, though fools should not heir therein. Let's go to Matthew. Let's go to the book of Matthew chapter 7 and verse 13. Enter ye in at the straight gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadth to destruction, and many there be that go there in that that go which go in thereat. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadth unto life, and few there be that find it. Amen. Amen. John 14 In John 14 and with verse read verse six, Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the father but by me. Amen. Amen. Today I felt like I had a little revelation and y'all just bear with me. Y'all be the judge of whether it's whether it's correct or not. But heaven has an address. Heaven has an address. Amen. 01 Jesus. Amen. 01 Jesus. How many knows that I was going to say 2000 2000 the Lord Jesus Christ. But 2,000 years ago is where it happened. Ain't that right? Calvary. And since the time of Christ, they begin given time again. Ain't that right? Amen. When you everything points back to the time of when Christ was uh died, right? So that's why I say 01. It might be 00. I could be wrong, but it's right there at Calvary when God came down and he bridged the way for us back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many know? And he is the way. He said the way you know and he said uh he said u I go to prepare a place for you and I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know and the way you know. How many glad that God made a way? &gt;&gt; Amen. The way to where? Heaven. How many knows Jesus is the way to heaven? Amen. He is heaven itself. He is heaven. &gt;&gt; You can't get to the father but by him. So let's put our compass and I put our GPS so to speak. Amen. On Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's many, many ways, many, many roads. And I believe even the pope said not so long ago, you know, we all serve to God and there's many ways that we get to him. How many knows that's a lie? Yeah. because he wants everybody come home to papa, you know, come home to papa, you know, and you go your way, you go to heaven, get to heaven your way, and this one gets to heaven that way. That's not what Jesus taught. &gt;&gt; Jesus thought there's one way. There's one Lord, one faith, one baptism. I am the way. You come this way or you don't come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many believe Jesus is the way? Now, our title. Have you got our title up there? I hope I spelled that right. I think y'all respelled that for me. I had probably had and I had navigator. The navigator. Amen. Amen. I had n a v a g- a t r something like that. But amen. So I'm glad you corrected my really good English. The navigator. We want to talk about the navigator for a while tonight. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. Amen. Hope you had a stretched your legs really good and ready. That comfortable seat feels real good now, don't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you richly tonight. We want to speak on the navigator. Amen. As we begin to think about this and we're going to basically we want to try to stay on the earth so to speak tonight because there's many times that I've preached. Amen. uh to where that the progress uh of mankind such as the airplane, such as the jets, such as uh the uh space shuttle and outer space travel. Brother Brandham said all of those natural achievements are a type of the spiritual achievements. Ain't that right? How that we've progressed and so forth. Amen. And how you know that we're you know spiritually speaking. Amen. We're up there in the astronaut age. Ain't that right? The age of the astronaut. Amen. And and we are we've got unlimited speed. Isn't that right? Out there. I guess you have unlimited speed. You can go really really fast out there. I don't know if you'd know it or not, but I don't know what you're going to pass to really tell you you're going fast. But anyway, but I don't want to go so much in that realm as I want to go just in talking about roads. Amen. roads. Amen. Traveling the roads and and and being navigated. I don't know. Like I said, the Lord just kind of give me that thought of the navigator. And so I said, "Well, you Lord, if you'll just bless it, then we'll go go from there." And I he really begin to pour it out to me. Amen. You would kind of laugh if I actually played you my phone while I was driving down the road. Amen. And boy, I was just having me a jubilee. And you would you'd say I was crazy probably, but I was having a pretty good time. Amen. You know, as the Lord was revealing some of these things, Amen. to me. Amen. But I got wrote down here, let's use our imagination just a little bit. Amen. First of all, if you lived, let's say, in Elton area or wherever area you are, just this small area all your life and you had never went to Hopkinsville, never went to Clarksville, never went to Dixon, Tennessee, never went anywhere, and mom, dad, somebody says, "I need you to go to Dixon and I need you to pick something up." You'd say, and you'd say, "It's just south of us." Okay. Now, can you imagine getting in the vehicle and heading out? It' be something else, wouldn't it? You you you'd say, "I don't know where it is. I don't know where this is." I told you it was south. Now, how many knows the the It used to be. Amen. Some of us probably still do. And that's when you go somewhere, you actually have a map. Folks, I I I congratulate you if you still do because we've got we've got a navigational system in our vehicles. Almost every every car about does. Isn't that right? A navigational system. Amen. Amen. Tells you how to get there. Now, the map used to tell you you used to go follow that map. Now, it's be pretty easy to teach somebody to just follow 79 or, you know, 181 to 79 and go on down and it'll take you into Clarksville, you know, and take them right there. And then, of course, JUST KEEP GOING FOLLOWING down through there and you'll you'll finally get to Dixon. YOU MIGHT FIND YOUR WAY WITH A MAP. AMEN. I got to thinking, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A A SONG, a gospel song that I'm using my Bible for a road map, and my last stop is heaven one of these days. &gt;&gt; How many believe this is our road map? &gt;&gt; This is our navigational system right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only this, but also the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter where uh where you are, even in the ocean and the ships and all of those, they have a they have a navigational system and they used to go by what? The stars. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In other words, to know HOW TO GET TO PLACES, they had to GO BY THE STARS. WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE NAVIGATED BY? &gt;&gt; HUH? &gt;&gt; Those are our navigators. That's right. Amen. And the ultimate stars, of course, THE NORTH STAR. CUZ ALL THOSE STARS REFLECT FROM THE STAR AND they point you to the north star. But those have been the ones that have helped the church to navigate. Amen. In the last 2,000 years THROUGH ALL THE COMPLEXITY OF LIFE. HOW MANY KNOWS LIFE IS COMPLEX? &gt;&gt; A MAP IS COMPLEX. TO GET TO SOMEWHERE, YOU'VE GOT ROADS EVERYWHERE. IT'S like spaghetti. There's just roads everywhere. And if YOU DON'T HAVE SOME LITTLE KNOWLEDGE, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU TAKE OFF without some kind of an idea or some kind of a map and you ain't never been there before, you better BE READY BECAUSE YOU'LL GET LOST. AMEN. And the one thing about our navigational system, Amen. I want to talk to you. Amen. Amen. About our n uh how did how did how did even our you know our navigational systems in our car, HOW THEY'LL THEY'LL TELL YOU. AMEN. when you're in a and they'll show you the blue line, right? AMEN. AND IT'LL TALK TO YOU. I ALWAYS LIKE TO HIT THE SPEAKER. HEY, get that speaker working. I LIKE WHEN IT TALKS TO ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IT'LL TELL YOU, GO PAST THIS LIGHT AND AT THE NEXT LIGHT, TAKE A RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? THAT'S how how how detailed it is. But now we also know and a lot of us have uh I I've heard of some people that has ended up in some kind of a cow pasture maybe because you know THE THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM ISN'T PERFECT. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S HUMANMADE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And you might think man I didn't order I didn't put in here no Herfords or no black Angus. I had an address here. I didn't want cows. But here we are and you're like MY THIS AIN'T THE RIGHT PLACE. ISN'T IT FRUSTRATING HOW THAT YOU GET, you know, a lot of us probably have, well, here this is SUPPOSED TO BE IT, but yet it isn't it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But how MANY KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE FOLLOWING THIS, this never mislead you. You never end up in a dead end road somewhere where you ought to be when you follow this. &gt;&gt; THIS GUIDANCE SYSTEM WILL GUIDE YOU, RIGHT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; And you need it &gt;&gt; through every aspect of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows that as in the natural realm, Amen. In the natural realm, Amen. We know that brother Bam says, you know, WHEN HE PREACHED ON LEADERSHIP, he talks about how that he says, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO GUIDE YOU, TO lead you, to help you. Amen. It is a child. Amen. And when you begin to walk it, mama will hold that little uh child's hand. Amen. And try to get it TO WALK A LITTLE AND go a little walking. And and after it gets so good, all of a sudden it tries TO WALK ON ITS OWN. AND NOW, BUT IT'LL FALL DOWN and and guess what? Mama comes over and help picks it up. Got to try again. AMEN. SOMEBODY TO GUIDE. SOMEBODY TO GUIDE. AND AS YOU GO THROUGH YOUR TEENAGE YEARS, WELL, that's a little bit more complex. Amen. You need a mom. You need a dad. YOU NEED SOMEBODY THAT'LL TALK TO YOU AND EXPLAIN THINGS to you because you've got emotions. YOU'VE GOT ALL KINDS of things to go through. How many believe we are our our natural realm of see, taste, feel, hear, and smell. It's a whole lot of roads. Amen. It's a whole lot of avenues. Amen. And if you don't KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THAT STUFF, you'll end up in a lot of trouble. &gt;&gt; Your reasoning, your memory, your conscience, and all of that. it. You got to really KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH those things. It's not easy and you need a guide. You need something to direct you. Amen. Praise the Lord. You get close to after teenage years. Amen. You get perhaps Amen. or close to 18 or you get the year of uh get into those years of uh of maybe wanting a mate or whatever it is. How many knows HOW ABRAHAM SAID YOU OUGHT TO PRAY ABOUT IT. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU need to you need to FIND THE RIGHT ONE BECAUSE IF YOU FIND THE WRONG ONE, you're going to be in a lot of trouble. IT'S GOING TO BE WATER IN YOUR BLOOD. YOU'RE GOING TO BE A WRONG ROAD. AMEN. YOU GET SOMEBODY THAT'LL UH MARRY PERHAPS AN UNBELIEVER or whatever it might be. You could be in a whole LOT OF TROUBLE IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL. AMEN. And way way down in some ditch somewhere. Amen. So, you have to be careful. And you want to make sure that you navigate you follow the navigator. And that navigator of course we realize is Jesus because he is the one that leads us and he guides us. Amen. Amen. You get married and have children. Amen. And all even marriage can be complex. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. In a life of sacrifice and not just about you now it's about the other person and it can be complex and you need to navigate THROUGH ALL OF IT. NAVIGATE THROUGH MARRIAGE PROBLEMS. AMEN. AMEN. AS A PASTOR, I KNOW I'VE HAD TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A WHOLE LOT OF CHURCH PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HADN'T ALWAYS BELIEVED THERE'S BRIAR PATCHES, A LOT OF LOT OF CUTS, A LOT OF BRUISES. &gt;&gt; HELLO. And a lot OF TIME WE HAVE CUTS, BRUISES, WE HAVE WRECKS and everything else. Amen. Because of our OWN SELVES SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES BECAUSE WE ARE GOT TOO MUCH OF OUR OWN SELF IN THERE YET. AMEN. Marriage and so forth come. AMEN. YOU GET OLD. YOU be get old and feeble and you can't do what you used to do. It's frustrating. And a lot of people, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IT'S easy to be a grumpy old man, a grumpy old woman when you can't do half of what you used to do. AMEN. YOU CAN'T HARDLY PICK YOUR FOOT UP TO GO UP THE STEPS ANYMORE. And you fall right flat face into the steps and say, "Man, I can't even lift my feet anymore. How do I navigate through this? This is frustrating. Getting old can be frustrating, people. &gt;&gt; That's right. You got to learn to accept. YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT HAVE HEALTH PROBLEMS. YOU MIGHT HAVE ISSUE this and issue that. Amen. It's something that YOU GOT TO DEAL WITH. SAY, "I've had that. Things come upon you not used to." And uh you know &gt;&gt; you GOT TO NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL OF that and try to keep a smile. &gt;&gt; Try to stay happy. &gt;&gt; How many believe you can? How many's glad that you can? &gt;&gt; You can stay up. You can keep your joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. because we can. [sighs and gasps] I want to How many remembers brother Brandham teaching that there's seven dimensions? Might see seem off the course a little bit, but we're going somewhere. The seven dimensions, the first three being light are time, matter, and space. Time, matter, and space. And you know, even if we didn't have a clock to tell us that we're in time, how many knows we'd know that we're in time? &gt;&gt; Our hair would turn gray. We'd get older. Sun would go up, sun would go down. Amen. It's time. But somehow they have put it into a clock and put 12 hands on it. Not hands, but 12 numbers. And they made it 12 noon and then 12 to midnight. I don't know why they didn't just go with 24 of them. Go a little slower and put 24 up in there. That was just a new idea. But anyway, that's right. So, they have 12. And by that, we know that we're in time. How many knows we're in time? &gt;&gt; Amen. When Adam and Eve when they sinned, how many know we were dropped DOWN IN TIME. BEFORE THAT, WE WERE IN ETERNITY. THERE WAS NO CLOCKS TO GO BY. They were in eternity and we were dropped down into time. MATTER OF COURSE, IT'S JUST HERE WE ARE. WE'RE IN MATTER. Everything's everything that is is is tangible, material. Amen. It's matter. Amen. And unfortunately, Hitler thought that we were all just matter. And Amen. Did he go into towns and wipe every living soul out? Ain't that right? He was ruthless. He was terrible. Wiped everybody out. Amen. AND ACTING TREATED THEM LIKE ANIMALS, LIKE THEY'RE JUST MATTER. But how many knows WE'RE MORE THAN JUST MATTER? There's down in here there's a soul. &gt;&gt; Those people out, they were souls. Amen. And the other one, of course, is space. Just a space out there. Amen. I mean, think about it from here to there. And it's, you know, it's, you know, it'd be nice to be able to just travel by thought, but we can't. We have to have vehicles and so forth to, Amen. to uh close the distance or get to where we're going. and going from this place to the other place. Amen. Has to do with Amen. our travelings and so forth. Amen. Then he talks about the fourth dimension. The fourth dimension he says is is in the realm of radio, television, sound going through this room. Is that right? All kinds of sounds, pictures, and everything else. And everything's going through here and we just can't see it. How many knows if God would give you the crystals in your eyes, Amen. like a like a television, the right tube, you'd be able to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that God gives a prophet? AND THAT PROPHET was born with his subconscience, like his dream world and the NATURAL WORLD SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT he could, so to speak, dream while he was standing IN THE PULPIT. AMEN. GOD WOULD SHOW HIM VISIONS. AMEN. The light would come. THERE'S ANGELS. ALL OF THOSE THERE'S THAT DIMENSION IN THAT REALM. AMEN. BUT RADIO AND ALSO BROTHER BAM SAID YOU KNOW that even demons are in that fourth dimension. Didn't he say cancer was a fourthdimensional disease and the cancer is actually demons. And there's something that I don't know how to teach really because uh I know that brother Ben one place he taught those different dimensions of three going this way and then three going that way or whatever and that middle one would have to be four I guess and I don't know just how to do all that. So we'll just stay with kind of the way he he brought it. Okay. Uh in in in one area anyway. The fourth dimension will be that. The fifth dimension he said was the regions of the lost. Fourth dimension is the regions of the lost where people that are not saved are. It's a terrible place. Amen. And then in the sixth dimension, sixth dimension is the saved. It's where he went. How many knows he went into that dimension when he was lifted up from his bed and went and SEEN THE SOULS OF THOSE THAT ARE SAVED UNDER THE ALTAR RIGHT IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. AMEN. Got over there and THERE AIN'T NOTHING BUT PERFECT LOVE IN that dimension. Ain't nobody has one WRONG THOUGHT THERE. NO ill feelings, no hurts, no pains, no nothing in that dimension. &gt;&gt; That's just above us. Ain't that right? AND THEN THERE'S THE SEVENTH DIMENSION where Jesus is himself. NOW, BROTHER BRANDON, one place WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE'S A trinity of the devil where the regions of the lost are. There's the demons and then there's hell itself. And up this way he says is the regions of uh of the the Holy Spirit. Amen. The saved AND THEN WHERE CHRIST HIMSELF IS LIKE A TRINITY. AMEN. both of them. And this is what he said. Now notice like this street here, here where there's mortals live, where these mortals live. How many knows he's talking about matter now where we are where mortals are influenced. We're influenced by an outside world. I should understand by the grace of God. I deal with spirits and I SHOULD KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. GOD. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? AMEN. HE WOULD WATCH A CERTAIN SPIRIT OF uh epilepsy or whatever it might be. And he had everybody CLOSE YOUR EYES. DON'T OPEN IT. Because for some reason, I guess if YOU GOT YOUR EYES OPEN and he would cast that out, THEY COULD COME INTO YOU. &gt;&gt; I don't know how. Can't just explain it why, but I don't know about you, but I'd shut my eye. &gt;&gt; Close your eyes. of the disrespectful pastor in his church one time was in THE BALCONY WOULDN'T DO IT AND THE WHOLE BUNCH WAS GOT INTO AN EPILEPTIC FIT. &gt;&gt; HELLO. BECAUSE THEY WERE DISRESPECTFUL and when HE CAST IT OUT OF SOMEBODY they went into them people. &gt;&gt; So he knows that people are influenced by another world. Amen. Oh my. And I look THROUGH THIS DARK MASS of gaity. And every once in a while, now notice he WAS KIND OF SAYING, let's say it's just black as night in here. Amen. Of gaity. Every once in a while, YOU'LL SEE LITTLE LIGHTS BURNING. That's right. There you are. It's your table today. Lights are burning. That's the Christian IN THE DARKNESS GIVING LIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY BELIEVE THERE'S DARKNESS EVERYWHERE WHERE YOU WORK, WHERE YOU GO, IN YOUR HOME, YOU'RE THAT LITTLE SPECK OF LIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. So he says, now look at this here. Now he says, the sinner is influenced by the spirit because he has a spirit and the wrong gives influence. Amen. And the right gives influence. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU, influences you, THAT GUIDES YOU, THAT CAUSES YOU TO do what you do, &gt;&gt; powered by it. Those are that are dominated by blackness and separation are dominated from the underworld of devils. TELL ME SOMETHING. WHAT IS THE WORLD INFLUENCED BY? WHAT ARE THEY GUIDED BY? They're guided by the underworld &gt;&gt; of devils. &gt;&gt; That's why they act like they do. THAT'S WHY THEY THINK LIKE they do. That's why they do like they do. Amen. &gt;&gt; The underworld of devils. Now notice now the first thing you know when you're going out this line. Amen. Get this straight. Here's where mortals live. A whole conglomeration of blackness and darkness. little lights placed in there now and then he says now that's Christians born again of light we are said on a hill a candle him in a room gives light to the room now notice now the wicked or the unbeliever is influenced from beneath he says there's a trinity of hell like there's a trinity of heaven they're influenced by evil powers then the first thing as you start down the first thing you find in the realm there amen you got the unsaved where and that that's where Jesus went and sold to the soul preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in a long suffering in the days of Noah. Next is demons. Next is hell itself. The world is influenced by these demon powers through a trinity. And the Christian is influenced by a spirit too. &gt;&gt; My scripture that I didn't read, I want to read now. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. How many believe it's important THAT YOU ARE LED BY THE spirit of God? &gt;&gt; The world in WHICH WE ARE LIVING IN IT IS COMPLEX. THERE'S A LOT OF TWISTS. There's a lot of turns. There's a lot of curves in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you NEED THE HOLY SPIRIT TO lead you, to guide you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THOSE TURNS. BROTHER B ONE place he SAYS IF YOU NEGLECT THE TURN AND TURN A CORNER YOU WILL WRECK. AMEN. So we find we find there's a lot of people that wreck. Amen. Remember just Judith Judith Potter out here on Stringtown Road going home one foggy night come out to the end of Stringtown. Y'all know it's a T. Well, she come up to the T and she was going too fast. [laughter] Poor thing. She was all right, BUT SHE COME OVER THERE AND JUST, MAN, slammed her car into the ditch. Amen. Amen. And if you aren't careful, when there's a curve and you don't turn, what are you going to do? &gt;&gt; You're going to crash. You're going to wreck up. Praise the Lord. So my point was here, amen, is that we're influenced or led by or powered by one or the other worlds. And that is listen to this. It is most miserable. It's most miserable. It's and devil devils are miserable out there by theirel. They're not happy unless they can inhabit somebody. &gt;&gt; I don't think people are HAPPY UNLESS THEY HAVE SOMETHING IN THEIR HEART. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU THINK THEY TATTOOED THEMSELVES, PUT MORE THIS OR THE other and AND DO ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS? To be empty is terrible. AND THAT'S WHAT the other empty. And the only WAY TO GET FILLED IS TO GET FILLED WITH SOME EVIL SPIRIT. AND WHEN THEY'RE TIRED OF THAT SPIRIT, THEY INVITE MORE SPIRITS IN. AND AFTER a while, they're just a terrible thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I was saying A WHILE AGO, IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT AMEN. AS A a as a child, as a child to have Christian parents to teach you, right? To get you on the right road. &gt;&gt; You see why we have to pity our young people? We have to pity our young people out in the world. They're our fellow Americans. They're our brothers AND OUR SISTERS. AS FAR AS A NATION AS OUR AMERICANS. But brother Bam SAID, "LOOK AT WHERE THE PARENTS ARE. IT'S PARENT DELINQUENCY. THEY'RE NOT GUIDING THEM. AND NOW THEY HAVEN'T HAD A GUIDE. NOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHO they are. WHERE THEY THEY'RE OUT THERE IN CHAOS. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? God help them." But they don't have to be cuz God's got a way for them. &gt;&gt; How many's glad for that? WE OUGHT TO BE HAPPY TONIGHT BECAUSE GOD HAS HELPED YOU. GOD HAS SHOWED YOU THE WAY. YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU OUGHT TO BE GLAD FOR GODLY PARENTS TO TRY TO TEACH YOU AND GUIDE YOU ON THE RIGHT PATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. So this way, it's a narrow way. How many believes it? It's a narrow way. It's a harder way. Not an easy way. Why? because you have to die to yourself. You realize that if you have self-control, if you have self-control, then you are more powerful than if you fought the devil. If you fought the devil himself, it would be as much as you overcoming yourself. &gt;&gt; What did brother Bam said was your greatest enemy? He didn't say the devil. &gt;&gt; No, it's yourself. Look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; Why? because he was defeated at Calvary. Ain't that right? But you have to overcome yourself. So if you can overcome yourself and actually bring yourself into the control of the Holy Spirit, you are that mighty warrior that brother Tommy puts up here sometime of great gladiator, a great shield and a great warrior. &gt;&gt; Paul was like that. That was Paul. He had conquered himself. He had taken the sword of the word and cut himself down. Amen. And he was yielded into the hands of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see this turn. Sometimes there's many turns in life, whether it's teenager, marriage, midlife, old age, decisions you got to make in that. How many knows that when brother Brandon preached on Zakius being in the tree and being where there's two branches and he was making a choice and he wanted to see Jesus, you know, he says and that's like two choices. Two road where two roads meet. The choices we make are where roads it's like at a crossroad. &gt;&gt; Amen. HOW MANY BELIEVES IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ROAD? AMEN. Because one leads to destruction, many going there at Amen. &gt;&gt; But the choices that we make determines which road that we take. And even Malachi 4 said that he came to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. How many knows those Israelites, the Pharisees, THEY COULDN'T TURN? THEY JUST COULDN'T TURN. &gt;&gt; NO, THEY JUST COULDN'T DO IT. But the purpose was THAT HE HAD TO GO TO THE children to the apostles TO CHRIST FROM THE LAW TO GRACE. &gt;&gt; And what did they do? They wrecked up because they couldn't make that turn. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Luther came out out of reformation AND HE BEGAN TO PREACH AND HE HAD A AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE AND THEY CHALLENGED his intellect and everything else, HE WAS TRYING TO TURN THEM, HEY, THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. THIS PAYING FOR YOUR SINS AND ALL OF THAT, IT AIN'T IN THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; How many knows? HE GAVE HER SPACE TO REPENT, BUT SHE DIDN'T REPENT. SHE WOULD NOT TURN THE CORNER. WHY? AND SO LUTHERAN COME OUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS A STRAIGHT SHOT. HOW MANY I KNOW THAT IN THIS IN THIS PATH IN THIS ROAD THAT WE GO, IT'S NOT EXACTLY A STRAIGHT. IT HAS CURVES. IT HAS HILLS. &gt;&gt; LIFE IS LIKE A MOUNTAIN RAILROAD. &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, he's a good he he could do you a good Sunday school on pilgrims progress of Amen. going through this swamp and the swamp of uh despair and all THESE OTHER AREAS TRYING TO CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN WITH THIS BIG HEAVY WEIGHT. AMEN. OH, I trust everybody's got rid of your weight. Amen. But choices that they make, Luther came out. Amen. And what DID THEY DO? THEY GOT SO TRADITIONALIZED, so set in their ways. Is that right? How many of you believe that you got to be careful about that? YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT'S GOING TO come and and DO SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THE HOW MANY KNOWS WHEN THE h in in the time of Israel when the WHEN THE PILLAR OF FIRE MOVED, they were to move. LET'S GO. LET'S GO. LET'S GO. FOLLOW THE PILLAR OF FIRE. WHEN HE STOPPED, THEY CAN'T. &gt;&gt; Ain't that the way IT IS IN LIFE? AMEN. WHEN YOU COME TO A STOP SIGN, IT'D BE BETTER FOR YOU TO STOP. &gt;&gt; And if THE GREEN LIGHTS GOING, I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, WON'T TAKE LONG. SOMEBODY going to blow the horn at you. &gt;&gt; GO STOP WHAT WHEN HE SAYS TO DO. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Life is like that. WESLEY I MEAN LUTHER GOT SO SO SET IN HIS WAYS PUT A PERIOD WHAT BEHIND HIM BELIEVE IN WESLEY COME ALONG AIN'T THAT RIGHT WESLEYANS COME ALONG BE SANCTIFICATION MORE THAN JUST JUSTIFICATION WE GOT TO GO DEEPER NOW &gt;&gt; LET'S KEEP ON GOING IF YOU GOING TO FLORIDA YOU CAN'T STOP IN ATLANTA YOU CAN'T STOP IN CHATTANOOGA hello but that's what they did they stopped &gt;&gt; they didn't keep doing. Imagine trying to go to Florida without a map, without a GPS, without anything. Hey, go down to Florida and pick this up. You ain't never been there before. You'd probably end up in California. Ain't no telling where you'd end up. Can I say something tonight? Without Jesus Christ, there ain't no telling where you're going to end up at. Without the Holy Spirit for your guiding system, &gt;&gt; there's no telling where you are going to end up at. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will never mislead you. &gt;&gt; He won't misguide you. &gt;&gt; How many knows that this way, this road, this the the way of holiness, Amen. It's a one-way street. &gt;&gt; Amen. A ONE-WAY STREET. AND WHERE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO WALK ON THIS STREET? Where are you supposed to walk on it? Right side, left side. &gt;&gt; Middle. &gt;&gt; The middle, right? That's right. DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. SOMEBODY SAID, "BROTHER BRANDON, MAN, you're going to get hit if you go down the middle of the road." Amen. You know, and he says, "Nah, what you fail to realize is is a one-way street. &gt;&gt; Everybody's going down the same way." AND GUESS WHAT? IT PITCHES A ROAD PITCHES. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO OFF TO THE RIGHT. HOW MANY KNOWS IF YOU GO OFF INTO FANATICISM INTO EMOTIONALISM, you're going to end up wrecked [screaming] up. &gt;&gt; WELL, MY GRACIOUS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, WE HAD SUCH A SHOUTING, SCREAMING, RUNNING DIALS, AND DANCING TIME. AMEN. AND TONIGHT, IT'S JUST SO BORING, you can't barely hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Boy, I'm telling you what, that church is dead. I need to find me a new church. Huh? You're going to know what you're going to do? You're going to end up wrecked up. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not about emotionalism. &gt;&gt; Even though I like it, you like it. &gt;&gt; But there's there's hilltops, there's valleys, all kinds of places that you go through. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the other side HE SAYS IF PEOPLE GO OFF AND THEY END UP WRECKED UP. AMEN. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT PENTECOST? LET ME FINISH MY OTHER STORY. AMEN. PENTECOST. AMEN. COME ALONG AND EVEN WESLEY COULDN'T TURN THE CORNER. HOW MANY ALL OF YOU WESLEY AND ALL OF THE LUTHERAN? All of Luther. ALL OF WESLEY. THEY SHOULD ALL BECOME [screaming] PENTECOSTALS. &gt;&gt; That's right. THEY SHOULD ALL BECOME PENTECOSTAL. THAT'S WHERE GOD WAS ON ISUZA STREET. &gt;&gt; GOD was doing this. It was his doing. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I like to be where it's God's doing. &gt;&gt; Not my doing, &gt;&gt; but his doing. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM TRIED TO TELL THEM, "NO, NO, NO. The evidence OF THE HOLY GHOST AND MEANING THAT YOU'RE SAVED IS NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU SPEAK IN TONGUES." THEY WOULD BEAT YOU ON THE BACK. THEY'D PRAY WITH YOU AND SLAP YOU UPSIDE THE HEAD. WHATEVER THEY HAD TO DO UNTIL YOU BEGIN. You don't know what I'm talking about, do you? That's what I said in Amish. BUT THEY WOULD SPEAK IN TONGUES. RAISE somebody heard and understood. But anyway, then he said, "No, that's not it." Why? cuz he's SEEN WITCH DOCTORS AND EVERYBODY ELSE SPEAK IN TONGUES AND WRITE UNKNOWN TONGUES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IT'S FURTHER. IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT. BUT THEY COULD NOT TURN THE CORNER IN 63 AND THEY PUT HIM OUT. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And what did they do? They wrecked [screaming] up. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FOLLOW THE NAVIGATOR. &gt;&gt; The g navigational system. Hallelujah. That's right. Wrecked up because of it. Amen. How many know even brother Brandham had to make a choice. Brother Brandon was preaching and he was just really tearing into the churches and the things they were doing wrong and everything. and Danny Henry, I believe it was, come up, you know, and he come up there and said, "That could be added to the book of Revelations. Let me pray for you." And he went to laying his hands on brother Brandham and praying for him, and he began to speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; Remember that? Begin to speak in tongues. And there was another French woman, I guess, or another A COUPLE MORE SPOKE IN TONGUES. AND THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE, A LADY in there that was French. She says, "That's not tongues. That's perfect French." Is that right? He spoke in French. AMEN. INSTEAD OF PRAYING FOR BROTHER BRANDHAM THAT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE FELT LIKE HE WAS WRONG, he spoke in tongues. And this is the prophecy or the what he said. HE SAYS BECAUSE THOU HAS CHOSEN THE NARROW PATH. BECAUSE THOU HAS CHOSEN THE NARROW PATH, THE HARDER WAY. THOU HAST WALKED of thine own choosing. Oh my. He says, I I can get that. All right. See, you choose yourself. CHOS MOSES HAD MADE A CHOICE. HE didn't have to. NEITHER DID I HAVE TO TAKE THIS PATH. I COULD HAVE HAD BIG BUILDINGS OUT YONDER LIKE SOME of them. Scott could HAVE BEEN FLYING ALL AROUND the uh United States. I COULD HAVE BE ALL ACROSS ON TELEVISION. But who would sponsor me with me tearing up their very foundation? Remember that one preacher CAME TO HIM SAYS, "BROTHER BANNON, WE WANT TO SPONSOR YOU. WE WANT TO GET TO A PLANE AND WE WANT TO HIT ALL THESE HIGH SPOTS, nerve centers." They want it to be big. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. When somebody wants to be big, it's not Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. When there's big eyes and little U's and I'm much bigger than you, that's not the message that Brother Brandham taught. He says there's no big eyes and little U's. We're all on the same level. We're all brothers and sisters. I thought, you know, I thought about any of us. We're equal. &gt;&gt; Let's all say that we're equal. &gt;&gt; No big eyes and little U's. That's the devil. That's pride &gt;&gt; that wants to make people feel like they're bigger than anybody else. And this one's bigger than that one. No, no, no, no. Don't even go to that. Cuz if you really want to think that you're big, you remember what Jesus said. Amen. Let him that is the greatest be servant of all. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the greatest. And what did HE DO? WENT DOWN THERE AND WASHED HIS THE DISCIPLES FEET JUST OFF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD OR WHATEVER FOREVER. HE KNEW WHY HE WAS DOING IT. HE WAS GIVING THEM AN EXAMPLE THAT YOU SHOULD DO AS I HAVE DONE UNTO YOU. &gt;&gt; PETER SAID, "NEVER. YOU AIN'T NO FOOTWATCH FLUNKY OF MINE. If I watch you not ask no part with me. Amen. But he chose. BROTHER BRANDON DIDN'T CHOOSE to have all this. [sighs] Amen. I don't have Listen, that's right. I I'd be tearing down that very foundation. But one thing, I DON'T HAVE to bow down to nobody's feet but the Lord Jesus Christ. That's right. I CAN PREACH WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. I DON'T HAVE TO COMPROMISE WITH THEIR organizations because I don't belong to them. I MADE THE CHOICE. AMEN. Just like he said, as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee. Amen. Moses made his choice. AMEN. BECAUSE THOU HAS CHOSEN THE NARROW PATH, THE HARDER WAY, THOU has walked in there walked of your own choosing. Now this man, watch how he's how it's wrote. You see what it's wrote in foreign words? That has picked the correct and precise decision. and it is my way. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY IN HERE CAN THINK OF TIMES THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE WRONG WAY? &gt;&gt; Chose the wrong path. &gt;&gt; We've all done it. If you're human, YOU AIN'T going to but make a mistake sometime and choose the wrong path. &gt;&gt; But one thing's for sure is you'll say, "Lord, help me. I want to choose the right path. Help me to make the right choice. &gt;&gt; Very, very important. How many knows Eve chose the wrong road and he'd let her to her wreck. Amen. David, even a temporary wreck, a small wreck. David had a man after own God's own God. WHEN HE CHOSE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD, it led to a lot of destruction, lot of humiliation. It was terrible. When we choose wrong roads, things don't turn out so good. &gt;&gt; Let's choose the right path. No, I like this. I like this. I've always said I've always thought that it was this, but I never I didn't I don't I don't know. Maybe the back of my mind, but brother Random actually kind of bears it out. Th walked of thy own choosing. Now this man, now watch, he wrote this. He says, "Thou has picked the correct and price decision, AND IT'S MY WAY." BLESS GOD. It's my way. He says, because of this momentous decision, a huge portion of heaven awaits thee. He says he had never heard about the vision. See, I always thought that it's those millions of souls that are going to be in heaven. Listen to what Brother Bram said. He never heard about that vision. You see, you remember the vision? huge portion of heaven awaits thee. What a glorious decision thou has made. This in itself will bring to pass and which will give and make come to pass their their tremendous victory in love divine. That's the part he didn't really know what was what it was. We can't say. But I do know that because he made the right choice, we'll be there, too. How many believe he'll be there? &gt;&gt; We're his converts. &gt;&gt; It would have been a terrible thing for him to make the wrong choice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. What did brother Brandham say about when he went beyond the curtain of time and also to the regions of the lost? He said he was in the regions of the lost also. And he said he was so terrible. HE YELLED, "MOM, NO MOM. DAD, NO DAD. GOD, [screaming] NO GOD. Nothing there. No God there." And he said, "God, if you'll bring me back, I promise I'll be a good boy. I'll do right." Isn't that right? And God brought him back out of there. He was dying of that gunshot, I believe it was. And he they were just he was really almost almost dead. But he says he come back and he says whatever you do don't go down that downward road. Young people don't ever go down that downward road. Don't take the wrong road. Don't make the wrong choice. Amen. Make the right choice. The greatest choice you're going to make is to serve Jesus. How many believe say, "God, I choose you." Without God, without the Holy Spirit, there's no way that I can make it. There's no way that you can make it. You'll end up wrecked up somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you start down the right word? Well, I don't have to listen to what mom and daddy says. I don't have to listen to what the preacher says. I want to quit going to church. Uh-oh. There is down the wrong road. &gt;&gt; Down that wrong road. It won't be long till there's no telling where you'll be in the misery that you'll be in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't go down the wrong road. Amen. All right. Couple more things. 15 after already. That was quick, wasn't it? Amen. Time goes fast when you haven't t haven't time. Brother Bandam is explaining something now. I want to talk about the cars that we have for a minute. Okay. And I want to talk about back in my day there was many of them that were manual. Ain't that right, brother Bannon one time in explaining when you get over there and they say he'll say to the goats, he says, you know, when I was hungry, you didn't feed me. When I was naked, you didn't clothe me. When I was in prison, you never visited me. Isn't that right? And then he said, "On the other eye, to the sheep." He says, "WHEN I WAS HUNGRY, YOU FED ME. WHEN I WAS CLO when I need clothes, you clothed me." And so forth. WHEN I WAS IN PRISON, YOU VISITED ME. And they said, THEY SAID, "WHEN DID WE DO ALL THOSE THINGS?" I didn't bring the quote out, but says, HE SAYS, "WHAT IT WAS, WHAT IT IS IS IT WAS SO AUTOMATIC IN THEIR HEARTS." AND HE SAYS, "THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT TO BE." AMEN. The Christian life that YOU LIVE NEEDS TO BE AUTOMATIC. &gt;&gt; Just something that comes from you, &gt;&gt; you know. And I was thinking about a Wednesday night. Sometimes it's hard to GET OUT, BUT WE COME TO CHURCH ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT because we believe in having church on Wednesday. &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE ON HAVING CHURCH ON SUNDAY. IF WE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ON COME HAVING CHURCH ON WEDNESDAY, WE wouldn't come. THERE'S CHURCHES THAT ONLY DO HAVE IT ONCE A WEEK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WHY? WE LOVE IT. WE WANT MORE OF IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE WHAT IS IT? BOUGHT BY God and &gt;&gt; enjoying every minute of it. Something like that. Amen. [laughter] ISN'T THAT RIGHT? HOW MANY HOW MANY ENJOY COMING TO CHURCH? &gt;&gt; WHY? AMEN. THERE'S THOSE THAT ARE KIND OF MANUAL. MAYBE THERE'S PEOPLE HAVE TO JUST REALLY STRUGGLE. BOY, I DON'T KNOW. I don't I don't really want to go to church, BUT I BETTER SOMEBODY'S going to wonder where I am. Don't have a manual transmission. Have an automatic transmission. &gt;&gt; AUTOMATICALLY. OH, PRAISE BE TO GOD. WE'RE GOING TO GET TOGETHER TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; We're going to HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT. EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BRING THEIR AMENS and their hallelujah. &gt;&gt; GLORY. BROTHER BAM SAYS, YOU KNOW, MY YOU GET A REAL CHRISTIAN THAT'S NOT IN A JUSTIFIED STATE. AMEN. NOT IN A MANUAL STATE, BUT AMEN. IT'S JUST SO AUTOMATIC. THEY'RE IN THE PRESENCE of God. Amen. Whether they HAVEN'T HAD A REVIVAL FOR SIX MONTHS, THEY'RE STILL IN A REVIVAL. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I WANT TO LIVE IN THAT CHAKANA GLORY INTO THE HOLIES of holies. NOT BEING OUT THERE WHERE THE CANDLE GOES OUT. I don't want my GAS TO RUN OUT. I DON'T WANT TO GET MY FILM. I want to be automatic. &gt;&gt; I want IT TO JUST FLOW OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMETIME BETTER B SAYS, YOU KNOW, MY DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE THAT AIN'T that are JUST IN A JUSTIFIED STATE. AMEN. THERE'S NOT REALLY COME ALL THE way in yet. THEY GOT TO COME TO CHURCH AND THEY GOT TO PRAY AND THEY GOT TO GET PUMPED UP. And maybe if the preacher gets excited, they'll get a little excited. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll TELL YOU WHAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE AN OLD WELL LIKE I USED TO AT HOME ON AN AMISH FARM AND WE'D HAVE TO GO OUT there and we'd have to get a bucket of water AND WE'D HAVE TO POUR IT IN OVER TOP OF THAT LITTLE PUMP. AMEN. Down the hole to prime it and then we'd have TO PUMP REAL FAST AND GET THAT THING PRIMED. And finally THAT WATER COME SHOOTING UP OUT OF THERE. HE SAYS THAT'S THE WAY SOME CHRISTIAN IS, MAN. YOU GOT TO GIVE HIM ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR OF PRIMING BEFORE YOU'LL EVER GET AN AMEN out of him &gt;&gt; or hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we DON'T WANT TO BE THAT WAY. HOW MANY I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT WAY. I WANT THAT ARTISIAN WELL SPRINGING UP. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO LIVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ANOTHER EXAMPLE MAYBE QUICKLY GIVE YOU. AMEN. THE CARS THAT WE HAVE. AMEN. HOW MANY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO get in there. It might be nice. You know, if you have a sports car, you know, you got this hot rod or whatever. MAYBE SOME OF THOSE FOLKS, they like to, YOU KNOW, THEY LIKE TO PUT THAT CLUTCH IN AND PUT PULL IT UP INTO SECOND AND YOU GOT TO PUSH this and you got to push this and you SHIFT IT AROUND. THERE WE GO. Brother Glenn, Sister Shay, isn't it nice to just pull it down into D and push the G on the G. Put it in D and press the G. Press the gas and off YOU GO. IT SHIFTS FOR ITSELF. You know, even that Dodge truck better, it's got a place where I could do that if I want to. Just shift it, you know, push it over in first gear. And I that means you can go a little rev it out a little higher. You can come up to A STOP SIGN. YEAH, IT'S GOT THAT OPTION. But a Christian likes it in automatic. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? An automatic. And you know, I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING IN CLOSING. And that IS THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. WE'VE GOT SOMETHING BESIDE THE AUTOMATIC. something beyond something further. Brother Joe probably he's got the newest truck probably of anybody. Amen. AND CAN YOU PUT IT ON AUTOPILOT? &gt;&gt; YEAH. It won't run a ditch. &gt;&gt; It won't run a ditch. You can take your hand off your gas. Can you take your hand off your brakes? Can you take your HAND OFF THE STEERING WHEEL? &gt;&gt; WOW. SO [screaming] ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS PUSH A BUTTON AND IT'S ON AUTOPILOT. IT WON'T WRECK IN THE OTHER GUY. WON'T WRECK IN THE DITCH. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S THE WAY YOU AND I WANT TO BE GOING DOWN THIS ROAD? AMEN. LET'S JUST LET HIM BE THE PILOT. [applause] LET HIM BE THE PILOT. OH NO. NO. A LOT OF US OLDER FOLKS SAY, "I DON'T TRUST IT. MY WIFE SAYS THAT. I WOULDN'T WANT THAT AUTOPILOT. LET ME HAVE THAT STEERING WHEEL. YOU GIVE ME THEM BREAKS AND YOU LET ME HAVE THAT GAS. THAT'S THE WAY WE ARE IN THE CHRISTIAN WALK. HELLO. I LIKE BEING ABLE TO HAVE CONTROL OF THINGS. BUT HOW MANY BELIEVES THIS PILOT? AMEN. CHRIST IS OUR PILOT. HE WON'T WRECK YOU. JUST LET GO OF THE WILL AND ENJOY THE RIDE. [screaming] ENJOY BEING A CHRISTIAN. ENJOY GOING TO CHURCH. ENJOY [screaming] THE THINGS OF GOD. AUTOPILOT. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. &gt;&gt; DON'T MAKE HIM YOUR CO-PILOT. THAT'S HOW WE LIVE SOMETIMES. WE WANT TO GO DOWN the road and say, "Oh, Jesus, you just sit there and hang on now. I'm driving this thing. I'm glad that you're with me." You know, BUT WE'VE GOT HIM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. WE DON'T WANT HIM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. HOW MANY BELIEVES HE IS MY PILOT? HE'S NOT MY CO-PILOT. HE'S MY PILOT. &gt;&gt; HE'S MY AUTOPILOT. [screaming] AMEN. AND LET HIM TAKE YOU HOME. LET HIM TAKE US HOME. HE KNOWS THE WAY. WE DON'T, BUT HE DOES. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'm glad. [sighs and gasps] [snorts] Amen. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Greater than automatic. We've got a autopilot. Sit back and enjoy the ride. One place, Brother Bam says, "Me and we are sealed. We've got the great leader leading us and guiding us. We're just enjoying a going along." &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not always easy. No. But if you'll commit it to him, &gt;&gt; he'll take you through. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SO THANKFUL THAT OH MY, YOU'VE HAD SO MANY STORMS. I MEAN, SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES THAT YOU COME UP TO. IF YOU'D HAVE JUST GIVEN IT TO HIM, IT'D HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER OFF. YOU'D HAVE LESS GRAY HAIR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You want to be young, YOU WANT TO LOOK YOUNG, QUIT WORRYING. BE LIKE THAT LADY THAT BROTHER BRANDON MET IN THE STORE. MAN, SHE WAS 60 LOOKING 30. WHAT DID YOU DO? I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, IF GOD CAN'T HANDLE IT, AIN'T NO SENSE IN ME WORRYING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S HOW WE WANT TO BE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. Like that man that went uh Brother Bam tells a story. I won't I won't read it, but I'm trying to hurry. But he was poor. THIS MAN WAS POOR. HE WAS A PALPER. AND HE COME UP TO THIS FLOWER, PICKED THIS FLOWER, AND THIS FLOWER SAID, "YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN POOR, HAVEN'T YOU?" "YES, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN POOR." "WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?" "You know, IF YOU CAN ASK WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU CARRY ME WITH YOU." AND HE SAYS, "I WISH THAT MOUNTAIN OVER THERE WOULD OPEN UP AND I COULD GET SOME GOLD AND SOME DIAMONDS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS." HE SAID, "AS YOU WISH." WOO! THERE GOES THE MOUNTAIN. HE GOES WALKING IN AND HE GRABS CHUNKS OF GOLD, GETS HIS BAG AND LOADS UP AND GETS AS MUCH AS HE CAN. HE SAYS, "MAN, I'M GOING TO GO UP THERE. I'M GOING TO GO BACK HOME AND I'M GOING TO SHOW HIM. SHOW HOW MUCH RICH [screaming] I AM. I'M GOING TO ENJOY IT." BUT HE SAID, "WHATEVER YOU DO, THAT'S FLOWER." SAID, "YOU GOT TO TAKE ME WITH YOU." BUT HE LAID IT ON THE SHELF. HE HAD TOO MUCH OF HIS STUFF AND HE WAS ENJOYING THE BLESSINGS OF GOD. BUT HE FORGOT THE FLOWER AND LEFT THE FLOWER THERE. AMEN. WENT OUT THERE AND I THINK SHUT UP. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? CLOSED UP. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH CHRISTIANS A LOT OF TIMES. [screaming] WE ENJOY THE PRESENCE OF GOD. WE ENJOY THE HOLY GHOST. DON'T YOU FORGET TO TAKE HIM ALONG. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, TAKE HIM WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; On this road, don't never leave him behind. You'll find yourself way out there somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen. As you go along, Brother Abraham tells the story of the prospector. Amen. Found gold out there prospecting. Filled his bag up and he was on his way home. Amen. How many believes that you FOUND GOLD? &gt;&gt; WE FOUND [laughter] DEITY. WE FOUND GOLD. AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY HOME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WHEN HE GOT TO HIS CAB AND HE WENT TO TRY TO GO TO SLEEP, THAT DOG BARKED AND BARKED AND BARKED AND BARKED. SHUT UP, FRITZ. SHUT UP, FRITZ, SO TO SPEAK. WE'LL CALL HIM FRITZ TONIGHT. CAUGHT UP, DOG. SHUT UP. AND HE WOULDN'T QUIT BARKING. HE FINALLY GOT UP AND SHOT THE DOG. HELLO. And later that night, somebody knew he had that. Somebody knew he had that and he went and killed him. But Abraham says, "The way that they know that he did it was the guy that shot him before dying confessed it." That's right. That's how you know the story anyway. And so, but what did he do? He hushed that voice. How many believes you need to listen to that navigator when it warns you of something dangerous near? AMEN. THAT PHONE DANGER IS NEAR. OVER HERE'S A TRAP. SO THE DEVIL LIKE A ROARING LION IS TRYING TO GET THE YOU TO AMEN. GO INTO THE ditch trying to rob you of your gold &gt;&gt; to keep you from getting home. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's listen to that still small voice. Don't never hush it. Young people, listen to that still small voice. Elena, listen to that still small voice. All of you listen to that still small voice. It'll lead you right. How many's glad for that still small voice? &gt;&gt; It was meant to lead us, to guide us. Stand with me, musicians, if you'll come. That's right. I truly believe that we're living in the hour when as brother Bannam as he was in Memphis and his plane was downed and he would go down a street and he would say, "Take a right turn. Take a left turn." Ain't that right? Oh, my plane's going to lose. I'm going to miss my plane. Fear tried to grip him. Don't let fear grip him. Just listen to that voice. We're living in the hour of the GPS of the Holy Spirit that tells you don't do this, don't do that. How many wants to hear that voice in a greater way than what you are? God help us. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we bow our heads to you now, Lord. Thanking you, Father, for your presence. Thanking you for the Holy Spirit that leads us, that guides us, Father, that even though you've given pastors to pastor people and and teachers to teach and and all these things, Lord, but the greatest and the main leader that you have given us, the main guide that you have given us is the Holy Spirit in each one of our lives, Lord Jesus. And we want to ask God tonight that you would help each one, Father, especially those of us, God, who have in the past know that we've taken wrong turns and it was bad. Lord Jesus, you've taught us not to. You've taught us to be more careful about the turns that we make, the choices that we make. Make sure it's not in your flesh. Make sure it's in the spirit. Make sure it's what God wants you to do. I ask God that you'd lead and guide everybody here at Evening Light Tabernacle. Lord, those that are streaming, ask God that you'd bless them. Father, we're glad that they listen. We pray God that you'll lead them, guide them, Lord Jesus, into the truth. For we know that you said that the comforter would lead us into all truth. We ask God that you would lead each one now, [music] Father, as we go through these perilous times, Lord Jesus, of robbers everywhere, devil everywhere, roaring lion, trying to take our joy from us, trying to take our peace from us, trying to get our eyes on the things of the world instead of the things of God. Amen. And to give us a greater passion for the things of the world than the things of God. Forgive us, Lord. We ask, God, that you would now, Lord, take and look beneath every hand, Lord, tonight. And Lord, I pray God that you're the navigator navigator of the Holy Spirit. [music] As Paul said, those that are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. That's what we want to be is led by you, Father. [music] We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Amen. And amen. God bless you, Brother David. Y'all help me sing it. God will make [singing and music] a way when there seems to be no way. [music] He makes a way. He will [singing and music] make a way for me. He will be my [singing and music] guide.
