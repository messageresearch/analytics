God bless y'all this morning it sure is good to be here in the house of the Lord ain't it I was listen to brother Baron this morning and you know he said I listen to him was at the very beginning of his sermon he said you know he said I can can be so tired he said I could be so wore out he said I could be so upset about something he said but just get me to the house of the Lord and he said you know all that just Fades away all that just goes away and I believe that this morning amen well God bless y'all we greet you from our church back home Bible believer Church of Lama Ohio our pastor brother Jonathan Martin he's an old stranger to you guys he sends his greetings I also bring greetings from my wife Zion she asked that I would greet you guys and uh apologize on her behalf she wasn't able to make it she's been battling with the Sickness last a little bit and we just thought it best that she'd stay home and rest this trip so she sure did want to be here and she asked me to greet you'all for her so instead we brought these two guys both of them together ain't as pretty as she is but we're doing okay amen I sure do appreciate brother M Nathaniel coming along helping me drive helping us out we should appreciate them should appreciate brother Sea and the church y'all having us this morning uh sure is a an honor whenever you know a pastor has confidence in you not only to preach for him but especially whenever he ain't there you know to so we sure do appreciate that and the confidence looking forward to what the Lord has in store for us today if we can let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of Psalms we're going to begin in Psalms 20 and we're going to begin in verse one there and once we're done there we're going to go to Isaiah the 10th chapter and we're going to begin in verse 24 The Book of Psalms 20 verse1 it would say the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of Jacob defend Thee I mean I think I thought that was amazing when I read that verse to think about that we serve a God that's so powerful and so mighty that just simply his name is a defense that we have against the enemy amen verse two send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of Zion remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifices say Grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfill all thy counsel we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God will we set up our banners and the Lord fulfill all thy petitions now I know that the Lord saveth his anointed and he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand I want to pause here for just a moment in reading this it says here in this sixth verse now I want now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed now if you look at this word saveth in the Hebrew concordance it would actually mean to be victorious or to give Victory unto so this verse would read now I know that the Lord gives Victory unto his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God they are brought down and they are Fallen but we are risen and we stand upright save Lord again give Victory Lord and let the king hear us when we call amen and from there going to the book of Isaiah the 10th chapter and verse 24 it would say therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts oh my people that dwelleth in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall smite thee with the rod and he shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of Egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall seize and my anger in their destruction and the Lord of host shall stir up a Scourge for him according to the slaughter of median at the rock of orb and as his Rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed it because of the anointing I would like to take my text this morning here out of this passage of scripture and if I can take for a title anointed to see Victory anointed to see Victory let's bow our heads this morning dear father we come before you humbly Lord and graciously father Lord we thank you so much Lord for the blessings that you've given us Lord just the opportunity to be able to gather together Lord and to be able to worship your name father Lord to be able to Worship You Lord in spirit and in truth Lord to be able to gather together in your presence father Lord and to Fellowship Lord under your anointing Lord how we love you and we thank you Father Lord as we enter into this service father Lord the songs have been sung Lord your presence has dropped in Among Us already father but Lord I ask that as the word begins to come forth you would just Lord you would move this broken vessel out of the way Lord you would just move me aside and you would come forth Lord and you're your presence and your spirit would speak Lord and you would meet the needs father you know every heart you know every soul here in this building you know what they have need of Lord we put the service to your hands we ask Lord that we would Lord surrender it all to you and that you would just come in and move in a mighty way we love you we thank you Jesus in your name we pray amen y'all can be seated this morning so laying a foundation for this thought here we see in this passage of scripture in Isaiah you've got to understand the backstory of what is going on here just a short little recap the army of Assyria is marching on the kingdom of Judah they have just finished taking over and completely wiping out Israel completely annihilating the country of Israel and now they are Marching on Judah now Assyria throughout this time throughout the Old Testament Israel Assyria is one of Israel and judah's most ferocious enemies we are at war with Assyria almost constantly throughout the Old Testament now if you begin to look you will see that at this period in time while the country of Judah they have stayed with the word they have stayed with what God has told them to do Israel has long left the word Israel has long left God as a matter of fact ever since the kingdom would be divided after King Solomon and two tribes would go into King rabom and become the king of Judah and the other 10 would go into go into King Jobo and will become the king of Israel after this has happened there was never again Godly King over Israel never again was there a Godly King but the nation of Israel would just begin to decline farther and farther into sin as time went on and so because of it now we see that uh God has allowed Assyria to move in he has allowed this King to move in and to completely overtake the country to clean him out to carry him away into captivity and this would actually be the last time that Israel is ever defeated this would be the last time that Israel that that they ever come together because these lost in tribes after they are overtaken by Assyria they would never again reunite they would never again come to together but at this point they would actually be scattered all throughout the world and they would never again return until World War II and so now we see that we have painted a very ugly picture for the king of Judah a very ugly picture because now the king of Judah he has just watched the king of Assyria come in and completely overtake the country right next to him he has just watched what they have done he has watched the Army come in and and and completely overtake them and now we see that uh the Bible says that the king of Assyria begins to get boastful the Bible says that he begins to get prideful he said the Bible says he begins to get lifted up in his heart and he begins to say I'm going to do into Judah What I've Done into Israel he says I'm going to do to Jerusalem what I did into Samaria and so now this stru F into the heart of the king of Judah we see he sees what's happened to Israel he's heard the army of Syria is on its way so I want you to notice his response what does he do does he start mustering his forces Gathering his armies Gathering the generals preparing for war preparing for battle no the prophet of God said or the Bible says that he went to the prophet that was his immediate response when the enemy came unto him whenever the enemy challenged him his immediate response was to go and consult the prophet so he goes to Isaiah and he asks what are we going to do and this scripture here that we are reading Isaiah the 10th chapter this is Isaiah's response to the king of judah's plea now I want you to notice his response the prophet tells God's people don't be afraid of this King don't be afraid of this enemy he said his yoke shall be destroyed his the the the the power that this enemy has over you is going to be destroyed now notice why because of the anointing not because you have followed me not because you have kept my Commandments not because you are a better people than Israel is but because you are my anointed people that you will be the people that I will save you will be the people that I will deliver because you are my anointed I will bring you freedom I will bring you Deliverance I will bring you Liberty because you are my anointed when I was looking at that I thought it was so powerful to see that God was Sav and will give power and authority unto a people for no other reason than they were his anointed people for no other reason that they were chosen and predestinated by God to be a people that were placed under his anointing and me I just want to begin this morning by saying I believe this bride is Anointed I don't believe there would be any dispute in that this morning that I'm standing this morning not just before the Bride of Jesus Christ but before the anointed bride of Jesus Christ I don't believe that we just sympathize with the anointing I don't believe that we just talk about the anointing that we are content with just feeling the effects of that anointing but the same anointing that flow through Jesus Christ is now flowing through this bride the same anointing that flow through the angel messenger is now flowing inside the heart of every believer that has come under the headship of that angel messenger amen I believe that we have that anointing and there's one thing that I want to make clear that devil this morning is that I know that I am anointed I know I've Got The Power of God I know I've got the Holy Ghost I know who I am I know where I came from I know where I'm going I know that I am anointed amen and the prophet of God would say if the Messiah means anointed he was the Messiah because he was anointed with the fullness of God then we are anointed too with the same Spirit now you say how do you know that you're Anointed with the same spirit with the same life the things that he did he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also what did he say and say St John 5:19 verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise and any correct Messiah would have the same message so if God does any one thing any child of God is going to do the same thing do you believe that this morning if the Messiah is anything any Messiah is going to do the same thing so if God is Anointed his children are anointed if Christ is Anointed his bride is Anointed there's no question about it there's no wondering there is no confusion and I just want to tell somebody this morning I might not know what you're going through I might not know what you're dealing I might not know what you're battling with but it really don't matter if I know it really don't matter if I know your situation because no matter what it is I can stand in confidence this morning and I can tell you that you were anointed by God to see Victory you were anointed by God to overcome you were anointed by God oh to come through this to come through this storm to come through this trial and to stand Victorious on the other side oh not because you're a good person not because you come to church twice a week not because you you you listen to tapes every day not because you read your Bible not because you do all these things but because there has been an anointing that has been placed upon the Bride of Jesus Christ has been placed upon you you are anointed to see Victory you weren't anointed for defeat you weren't anointed to fail you weren't anointed to watch the enemy Prevail in your life but you were anointed to overcome you were anointed to Prevail you were anointed to destroy the Yoke of every enemy that would come against you you were anointed to see Victory I love how the prophet would say you were anointed too with the same Spirit not a similar Spirit not a loing spirit but the Same Spirit In other words the spirit that Quicken Christ is the Same Spirit that's quickened you the spirit that raised Christ up from the dead is the same spirit that raised you up from the dead The Same Spirit the same power that was placed upon the physical body of Christ is the Same Spirit that's moving today through the spiritual body of Christ amen the prophet would go on and he would say the Holy Spirit Body of Christ will move just as Christ moves and if Christ in heaven can never get his spiritual body on Earth moving as he wants it to move watch for things to happen he said now it's beginning to come to life they've paralyzed it long enough but the holy spirit is bringing life into it and it's beginning to wake up and it's begin to move because it sees its position amen church this anointing this Holy Ghost is bringing life into the body I ain't looking at a dead corpse this morning I ain't looking at a dead body I ain't looking at a at a still paralyzed body but I'm looking at a group of people that have allowed the anointing that God placed upon them to move through their life you are moving as Christ moved you are living as Christ moved you are moving you are you have stepped into your position you are anointed by God to step into that position because God had a purpose for your life he had a purpose for you he had a position for you he had a stand for you that he wanted you to stand on and God has anointed you to step into that position if Christ was anointed to withstand Satan I say I'm anointed to withstand Satan if Christ was anointed to raise from the dead there's no reason I'm going to stay in the grave because I was anointed to raise from the dead if Christ was anointed to do anything to stand Victorious to overcome I am anointed to do the same thing because I am the manifestation of Jesus Christ and as that manifestation I will do anything that Christ did I will manifest the same power I will manifest the same Authority I will manifest the same anointing that was placed upon him because I the manifestation of Jesus Christ and that word has come to life inside of this body because I have stepped into my position under the anointing of the word the prophet would say as Jehovah Eagle is the Great Eagle we're the eaglets he's the Messiah and with the same anointing we are the Messiahs amen anointed Messiah means the anointed one he asked the question are you anointed amen with what the same spirit that he was anointed with The Same Spirit he was anointed with amen now Isaiah 61 and verse1 it's a very familiar scripture to us but it would say the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord oh thank you the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them the mourn and and to give un to them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified now I want you to remember in reading this this chapter is speaking of Jesus Christ right is prophesying of the role of Jesus Christ and the anointing that will be placed upon him and I thought it was so powerful that before the prophet of God would ever come along and would show us that we will be placed under the same anointing as Christ God would actually give us a list of everything that Jesus Christ was anointed to do he was anointed to preach the word he was anointed to bind the Brokenhearted he was anointed to Proclaim Liberty to get Beauty for Ashes to open the prisons to them that are bound Jesus Christ was anointed to do all these things through his Natural Body and now the private will come along and would say that the natural always tops the spiritual so anything that Christ was anointed to do the body was anointed to do the spiritual body was anointed to do she is Anointed to preach the word she is Anointed to bind the Brokenhearted she is Anointed to open the prisons she is Anointed to give Beauty for Ashes she is Anointed to do all these things oh because Christ was anointed to do it in the sermon why are people so tossed about the prophet will go through Isaiah 61 and he would talk about this anointing they'll be placed upon Jesus I would recommend you go and listen to this sermon it's a it's it's a powerful sermon why are people so tossed about and he would talk about this anointing that be placed upon Jesus and he would say now that is what's here he would say now that's what's here I love that it's not something we're looking for out in the future it's not something that we had out in history it's not something we just read about in this book in this Bible it's not something that was just for brother Brandon wasn't something that was just for 1965 it wasn't just something that was just for those people it was just for the apostles it was just for the prophets it was just for Jesus but he said that anointing is now here that power is out here I just want to say this morning the anointing is here the anointing favors the Bride of Jesus Christ oh you look the denominations have a portion of the anointing the Pentecostals have a portion of the anointing and they're content with their portion the prophets God said that man will be given a lesser portion of the anointing but that the that the body of Christ would have so much anointing that she would be the fullness of the godhead deity oh I say I'm not living with a partial anointing I'm not living with just a little bit of anointing I'm not living with just a small aspect of that anointing oh but I am living with the full anointing of God oh this anointing church has been placed upon this bride of Jesus Christ not just some of it but every single bit of it there ain't no limit to what you can do there ain't no limit to where you can go he didn't say you can go to this church age or you can go to this point you can go to this point and then you're going to be done no he said I'm going to have a bride that's going to be placed under an anointing and that anointing is going to take them all the way it's not going to take them halfway it's not going to take them 75% it's not going to take them 99% but that anointing is going to take them all the way that anointing is going to take them all the way amen I love that oh I love that we've been given the full anointing to take this message and to apply every word to apply every single promise to live in Victory to live an overcoming life I don't know about you church but I'm not satisfied with manifesting a portion of this message I'm not satisfied with just expressing a portion of this word oh but give me every word I say give me every line give me every single promise give me every single precept give me everything it said I want to manifest the easy Parts I want to manifest the hard Parts I want to manifest the encouraging Parts I want to manifest the rough Parts I might not fully get it I might not fully understand it but if the word said it then I'm going to believe it and I say I'm going to manifest it because I was anointed to manifest it I was anointed to live it I was anointed to stand in Victory I was anointed to overcome I was anointed to say there ain't no devil there ain't no sickness there ain't no power there ain't no principality there ain't no Darkness there ain't nothing that can stop a memory of the B body of Jesus Christ that has come under the anointing of God hallelujah I was anointed to Manifest this message the prophet of God would say in Christ's mystery God revealed there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church having the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people I like that brother kale what kind of people are y'all over there we're anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by Why by accepting what he turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word so we aren't just anointed but we are anointed with the very word of God so we see brother brandham is telling us here that there will come a time when God would have a desire to express himself in fullness not express a portion of himself not in heart but his desire was to be expressed in fullness there was going to come an age when God would have a desire to express who he was oh of what he was of what he could do of the power that he had and the way that he was going to express himself was through a group of people that were Anointed with the word not just any people not just any group not just any church but that word must come through God's anointed people now that word anoint means to consecrate to identify as sacred to set apart for a specific purpose so to think this morning this group of people this anointed body has been set apart for a specific purpose you've been consecrated church you've been set aside you are not a part of the world you are not a part of leot C you are not part of the church today Bo but you are a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ and you have been anointed you have been set apart you have been segregated you have been you have been divided you've been set apart I don't believe that God would set me apart from before the foundation of the world for just any reason I don't believe that God would just come and would predestinate me and would make me a member of this bride body for no reason but if God is going to anoint a group of people is because he has a purpose for that group of people is because he has a purpose that he wants them to do I mean I mean maybe I'm just here to tell somebody maybe one person this morning that maybe you feel like what you're doing ain't good enough maybe you feel like you're helpless maybe you feel like you ain't doing nothing oh but if you are a member of the Bride body of Jesus Christ I'm here to tell you this morning there is a purpose that God has for your life because God does not send anointing without sending purpose God does not send anointing without giving you a position but if God anointed you as a member of the Bride body of Jesus Christ he has given you a position that you have to step into he has given you a purpose maybe sometimes you feel like just sitting there in the congregation maybe you feel like the that you're help but you ain't doing nothing maybe you feel like just aen in the preacher ain't doing nothing maybe you feel like oh just sitting out there just praying for people maybe you feel like you don't do nothing but I'm here to tell you this morning there is a purpose that God has for your life God has placed you under an anointing and that anointing has given you a purpose it has given you a position that you got to fulfill oh maybe the smallest person in the world brother Brandon said even if you are the even if you are the pey toe even if you are the skin on the bottom of your foot you still have a purpose you are still over every devil you are still over every sickness you are still over every complex you are still over every battle you are still in Victory because every part of Christ is Anointed every part of Christ has a purpose every part of Christ has a purpose has a position they have to F if you begin to study in the Bible you will see that there were only three groups of people that were anointed in the Old Testament there are the prophets there are the priests and the Kings these were the three positions and if you begin to look you will see that each of these roles had a very special purpose that they were elected to perform and as God's people it was only under that anointing that they could rightly fulfill the purpose the way that God had had designed them to do it and now we know that Jesus Christ came in a natural body he fulfilled all three of these roles that the anointing was designated for he was anointed as a prophet as a son of man he was anointed as a priest after the order of melchisedec he was anointed as a king as a king of Heaven as a king of all Kings he was anointed to be the complete fulfillment of the word and now the prophet will come along and will show us that the bride the body would be under the same subject to the same anointing as the head the brother Bandon would say anything that the head does the body has to follow if the body Rises up out of the Grave or the head rise up out of the Grave the body has to follow if the head moves the body has to move if the head stands the body has to H has to stand anything the head does the body has to do so if God predestinated you if he elected you and he anointed you and placed you inside of this body it is because he has a purpose for your life okay what is that purpose I'll just go back to what the prophet said he said that purpose is so so that so that he God the word could be made manifest through you Church who are you this morning you are the manifestation of the perfect word of God you are the manifestation of the word that was in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world you are made to Manifest this message you were made to Manifest this word you were made to stand and you were anointed to stand you were made to plant your feet down and to say I'm not going to back up I'm not going to move I won't go to the left I won't go to the right I have a position that God made me for I have a position that God anointed me to stand in and I ain't going to move but I'm going to plant my feet down this morning and I'm going to stand in a position that I was anointed to stand in he anointed me for this message so I'm going to live this message he anointed me for this word so I'm going to manifest his word he anointed me to stand in Victory so I will stop at nothing short of complete and total Victory oh hallelujah amen how was God alive today you are how he is alive today how was God moving today you are how he's moving today well brother Caleb how does God do this how do God do this because he's going to have an anointed individual that'll be willing to stand up and say God you've anointed me for something what is the purpose you have anointed me for oh and I think we need more in the Church of is more people that will stand and say God what do you want me to do what is your purpose purpose what is the calling you've placed in my life what is it that you want me to do I know you've anointed me I know you've predestinated me I know that you called me as a part of this bride of Jesus Christ now what can I do for you amen this generation today it's all about give it's all about what can I have what can I have give it to me give it to me give it to me give it to me what will Church give to me what will Jesus give to me what will the pastor give to me what will these people give to me oh but what are we what we need is in people that were Anointed with the word to and say God you've given me everything you've given me everything you got you've given me salvation youve given me anointing you given me Victory you've given me liberty now Lord what can I do for you what can I do to overcome what can I do oh to just spread your message a little bit farther in this Dark World what can I do just to spread the loud of this gospel oh we need to stop acting like victims we need to stop acting like people oh who that who that oh that we just need to take we just need to take oh just give me something else well say Lord what can I give to you Lord I was anointed to do something Lord what can I do I was anointed to preach this gospel so I'm going to preach this gospel with everything that is is inside of me oh Hallelujah because I was anointed as a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ to stand in Victory amen listen to what the prophet said there would come a time when he would Express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity on down oh my to bring back the anointed bride not to make the anointed bride not to form the anointed bride oh but to bring back the anointed bride to bring back means to restore that which already existed to restore that which already existed oh so to think tonight just thinking about that before time ever began think about that this morning before time ever began before the world was ever created before man was ever spoken into existence you were already anointed in the mind of God to express this word you were already anointed to express healing you were already already anointed to Express Victory you were already anointed to express power you were already anointed to express Authority you were already anointed in the mind of God to have victory over every single devil that would come against you oh Church whatever battle you're facing through this morning whatever devil you're facing why don't you just tell that devil devil before you were even created I was already anointed to defeat you before you even took a first breath I was already anointed to overcome before you even stood there and said I'm going to fight him I was already anointed he said come on devil I've got a sword and I'm going to cut your head off oh Church before every battle you've ever been through when God predestinated you he predestinated the outcome of every battle you would ever face every trial you would ever face every storm you would ever go through because the moment that he anointed you for victory he anointed every enemy you would ever face to be defeated I say I can stand in confidence this morning that I am not only oh anointed to for for victory but my enemy was anointed to lose my enemy was anointed to be defeated Satan you're defeated this morning you were anointed to be defeated you were anointed to lose you were anointed for us to cut your head off you were anointed by God oh because he anointed me for victory oh and if you're my enemy I say you better watch out devil because there are some anointed people they are taking this sword they're taking the sword God has gave them and when the anointing comes and contct with their bride body oh they are going to be the heads of some demons around here this morning oh because if you were anointed I say you will see Victory oh Hallelujah you were anointed for victory oh you were anointed to overcome you were anointed to stand there and say there ain't no devil there ain't no sickness oh maybe you're going through something this morning maybe it looks bad maybe the sickness looks bad maybe the complex looks bad maybe the depression looks bad maybe maybe you think there's no way out but I'm here to tell you if you are a bride of Jesus Christ you were anointed to see Victory you were anointed oh the outcome of the battle was already predetermined the outcome of the battle was already over the outcome of the battle was already finished oh I say come on devil you might hit me you might strike me you might push me down you might knock me down oh but this is one fell that's coming back this is one fellow that's going to get back up because I was anointed for victory I was anointed to stand on this word come on Church you weren't anointed to live in defeat you weren't anointed to live under the thumb of samur no devil but you were anointed to stand on the word to shout the victory to praise through the storm to praise after the storm to praise going into the storm you were anointed to worship my God you were anointed or to stand and say God even if I can't see it right now I know the victory is coming even if I can't see it in this moment I know that overcoming is coming so I'm going to stand and I'm going to worship and I'm going to praise oh because you have given me the victory hallelujah oh well Caleb you're just a Pentecostal no well Caleb you act like a Pentecostal no the Pentecostal is act like me well Caleb how can you say that I'll show you by the word how I can say that the Pentecostal started shouting for Joy 1906 at isza street I was shout for Joy before the foundation of the world in the presence of my king I was crying holy holy holy holy oh before they were even dancing I was dancing before they were dancing I was shouting before they were shouting oh I was praising God I say before the world was ever created I was anointed to worship my God so why would any trial make me stop worshiping why would any devil make me stop worshiping I say I was anointed to return back from whence I came oh and if I was yaning for Joy over there I'm going to be dancing for joy over here I'm going to be shouting for Joy over here because I was anointed to see Victory oh you got to watch it Caleb be careful be careful Caleb you're saying that the anointing is that that's what the anointing is you got to dance you got to shout no I'm not saying that brother Brandon was very very clear he made it very very clear to us that that was not what the anointing was he said and why are people so tossed about he would go through it he would say the anointing is not emotion period make it very clear the anointing is not AEM motion that's not what the anointing is he said the anointing is supreme power in control supreme power in control oh okay what does that mean well in the sermon the uncertain sound the prophet will go through supreme power and he would say that by Perfect faith in the word of God the believer is given the supreme power of God so if God was going to give this supreme power unto a group of people he was going to give them a way to control it he had to give them a way to channel that power the prophet of God said that the Pentecostals could not have the power that we had he said that the Pentecostal had the power we had brother Braham said he they would be empty and out hospitals all over the world that's what they be doing with it oh but it wasn't meant for the world but this power was meant for this bride and so he was going to give this people a way to Channel or control this power and the way he would do that was through an anointing that would come in and then not only had the supreme power of God but it would also channel that power inside the believer inside the bride it would channel that power that's why every time you know when brother Baron would have a prayer line he would say I'm waiting I'm waiting on the anointing he would say I'm waiting on that power I'm waiting on the anointing to come down because it was only with that ano anointing that that power that was placed inside the bride that power of Jesus Christ could be channeled could be channeled could be worked through oh it was only under that anointing that's what it is brother bam said it's not a motion it's not a workup it's not a buildup it doesn't make you dance and Shout but now that thing's all right I love that stuff brother bernham said that joy in your victory was what brought that he said but the anointing is supreme power in control amen I love that this morning supreme power in control Hallelujah brother Brandon say Jesus was the most anointed man that ever walked the face of the Earth so to think this morning that the same amount of anointing that was flowing through him is now flowing through you oh church we don't have no shortage of the anointing we aren't wanting for the anointing but the same amount of anointing has now been placed inside of you we are living in an overflow of the anointing of God we are living in an outpouring of the Holy Ghost we are living in an age where every devil in hell has been Unleashed every sickness has been Unleashed every disease has been Unleashed every Power of hell has been Unleashed oh but fear not little bride every bit of word has been Unleashed every bit of a power has been Unleashed every bit of authority every bit of power every bit of healing has been Unleashed for the Bride of Jesus Christ and it hasn't only been given to you but you have been anointed to take it you've been anointed to take healing and to express it you've been anointed to take Victory to express it you've been anointed to take your Liberty and to express it through the perfect word of God oh hallelujah oh the anointing is here I said whatever battle you're facing there is enough anointing ing there is enough word there is enough power there is enough Spirit to kill every devil to kill every giant to kill to stop every enemy that comes against you there is a power that is here this morning oh bride now is not the time to live under your privileges now is not the time to live under the promises that God has given to you oh but stand on the word stand under the anointing of God and take a hold of the anointing take a hold of your Victory reach out and grab it this morning oh that's as simple as it is brother bandam said all you got to do is reach out and take it you ain't got to go through a 10-step process you ain't got to go through some AAA system you ain't got to go through some process you ain't got to go through some oh through some system oh but brother bandham said if you just stand on the word of God and just reach out and take what you have need of oh that's how simple as it is oh church if you're in bondage tonight you can just reach out and take the key to the chains oh if you're in trouble tonight you can just reach out and take a hold of your Victory oh if you're in trouble this morning I keep saying tonight y'all forgive me I'm used to preaching in services oh but this morning anything that you have need of all you got to do is reach out and take it you were anointed to take it you were anointed to take your Mountain you were anointed to take the land you were anointed to take your Victory you were anointed to take the enemy you were anointed to Prevail over the gates of hell you were anointed to stand amen Joel 2:23 it will say be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he ha given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil so there'll be overflow of wine and an overflow of oil now the prophet would expand on this oil and wine in the third seal and he would say that that oil represented the anointing of the holy spirit that oil represented the anointing and that that wine represented the stimulation Revelation knowing the third seal he would say the oil and wine in the Bible is associated together always he said I got the concordance and I look there's a string of them like that where the wine and the oil goes together all the time see when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his saints that is filled with the oil they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation Glory he said I fill it right now stimulated with joy and Shout see and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man oh because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with the oil and the Revel is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave himself unnormal oh my C why do you all act unnormal oh because when a revelation is revealed to an anointed body it brings simulation it's going to bring a little simulation it's going to bring a little bit of life it's going to bring a little bit of Joy it's going to bring a little bit of Praise oh come on somebody when I hear this word I get stimulated when I hear this message I get it a little stimulated because when the word is revealed to an anointed body I say there is going to be some stimulation in the house of God what do we do when we heard the revelation of the seals we got stimulated what do we do when we heard the revelation of the church ages we got stimulated what do we do when we heard adoption we got stimulated oh because when the Revelation comes in contact with the anointing there is going to be some stimulation happening there's going to be some life there's going to be some worship there's going to be some praise oh why you acting like that I can't help it act like that the spark of Revelation has come in contact with the oil anointing oh and I see there is some stimulation happening in the Church of God oh hallelujah oh I know what it means just for some extra clarification I looked up the definition of the word stimulate all right y'all got a minute it's a long definition it means to revive to rekindle to enlv to Quicken to light up to ramp up to fire up to juice up to vitalize to invigorate to jumpstart to power up to jolt into ignition to energize into action okay what happens when the anointing comes in contact with Revelation I'll tell you what happens it brings stimulation you'll get worked up you you'll get stimulated you'll get revelated you'll get enlivened you'll get quickened you'll get invigorated you'll get vitalized you'll get amped up you'll get powered up you'll get Juiced up you'll get energized into action I say this morning I ain't looking at a dead bride I'm looking at anointed bride I'm looking at a said at a stimulated bride I'm looking at a revelated bride you have been enen you have been quickened you have been empowered by the Holy Ghost to see Victory oh one of the definitions meant to rekindle oh maybe your Fire's a little low this morning maybe your Flame's gotten a little low this morning oh but I can tell you a place where there's some good oldfashioned Holy Ghost gasoline oh where there's some oil anointing oh that you can get lit up you can get fired up you can get that fire going again oh hallelujah oh church I say we are on fire this morning there was a church that is on fire we ain't dead we ain't meant to sit here oh when it Just watch and say yes oh yes that sounds good no you were meant to live it you w meant to take a hold of it you w meant to take it inside of here and say I'm going to stand I'm going to praise because the anointing is here and I am anointed to see Victory oh I've watch some fire some natural fire makes some people shout when it starts to spread I've watch some natural fire makes some people dance when it gets on the edge of their shoes I got to thinking if a natural fire on the edge of my shoes can make somebody dance oh how much more will the Holy Ghost Fire shut up in my bones make a Believer dance oh I see we've got a reason to Rejoice we've got a reason to praise because there an anointing that's here in this building this morning and you've been anointed by God to overcome yes sir oh Hallelujah you were anointed to overcome oh Caleb you don't understand we were on fire last week but the church is going through a cold spell right now the church is going through a season the church is going through something you know now listen I understand churches are going to go through Seasons it's actually a very important thing that that we need to accept as the bride is that this brother BR said the church is going to go through Seasons the church is not always going to be in Revival brother B said the church is going to go through Seasons I know that you're going to go through Seasons well brother Caleb we're we're battling with some indifference in the church right now we got some church problems some church issues that we're trying to battle with I guess the anointing ain't here no more I guess the power of God ain't here you said Caleb that's silly that's how people's minds act so many times it's said because we're going through something because you're going through a season because a Believer is going through a season that means the anointing ain't there that means the power of God ain't there but that's not what the prophet said oh the prophet went through Seasons brother Bam's Church went through Seasons but I'm going to want you to listen to what he said he said there's something within us a fire that is burning a life that has been lit by God and no breezes can blow it out there's no cold spells in the church there's no indifference amongst the people there's no persecution of the world that can blow out a flame that God has lit for it's God's purpose that his torched light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no power can blow it out they will only Merk it burn brighter as they blow oh Hallelujah it will only make is burn brighter as they blow oh Satan is trying to blow us out this this morning Satan is trying to blow your flame out oh but why don't you just tell that devil oh I'm just burning brighter you put us through Seasons but I'm burning brighter you put us through church problems but I'm burning brighter you put fa Faith Tabernacle through situations you put Faith Tabernacle through some indifference you put Faith Tabernacle oh through some Seasons oh when I say we are burning brighter than we ever have been before Oh and F Tabernacle is standing in Victory because we are anointed for victory we are anointed to overcome we are anointed to stand oh we are anointed to work through the church problems we are anointed to work through the indifference we are anointed to come through the trials to come through the storms oh and to stand and say maybe the trials came maybe the storms came oh but I was anointed and the anointing overcame the situation the anointing overcame the circumstance the anointing overcame the devil oh Church whatever you're going through this morning there is an anointing that's been placed upon you to overcome oh Hallelujah they try to blow your fire out oh but brother BR say you're burning brighter because of it oh don't get worried oh when when criticism comes don't be worried whenever those things come don't be worried whenever Trials Come When Storms Come when that wind starts blowing it just makes that flame burn brigher oh whenever that rain starts to pour I was reading this story here while back where they they had a huge fire and there was gasoline going everywhere and it started to rain and everybody thought oh well it's raining the fire's going to go out we a got to call the fire trucks we ain't got to call nobody and the rain started pouring but you know what the storm did they said all the rain did was spread that gasoline oh and that fire was burning brighter than ever before Oh church maybe you're going through a storm this morning maybe it's raining maybe it's storming maybe the wind is blowing oh maybe it looks hard oh but I say all that that rain is doing is spreading the gasoline all that rain is doing is making the fire burn brighter oh because there is an anointing here and no storm can blow that anointing away oh no power can blow that anointing away no devil can blow that anointing away oh I say you are made to stand in Victory you are made to overcome you are made to stand like a house built upon a rock and say I have a firm foundation I'm standing on this message I'm standing on this word I ain't standing on a man's idea I ain't standing on no man's opinion I ain't standing on no denominational Creed oh but I am standing on the unadulterated word of God and I am anointed to see Victory yes sir amen I looked up what happens when the oil and wine comes together and you know Google they started this thing where when you Google something it brings up this AI response and'll it'll generate you this artificial intelligence response and so I just looked up what happens when all the wine comes together and this response is generated for me it said to exercise Extreme Caution when mixing these together because when oil and alcohol joined together the mixture created is so flammable and combustible it forms a potential explosive oh Hallelujah devil you better exercise Extreme Caution when placing hands on this bride you better exercise Extreme Caution when you are touching a member of this bride cuz I see there is some chemistry happening in the Church of the Living God this morning oh I say that we are going to explode all the oil and wine have come together and there is an explosion in the Church of the Living God I say watch out devil you're messing with some potential explosive you pressed my buttons and you've pressed my buttons over this morning oh you press the wrong button and there's an explosion of Faith there's an explosion of power there's an explosion of anointing oh and we are coming out of this oh I see Bride we are coming out of this you were anointed to come out you were anointed to stand you are anointed to see Victory oh that Devil Comes oh when I say exercise Extreme Caution devil because there are some explosions happening in the Church of the Living God oh Hallelujah hey man Church you were anointed for Rapture you were anointed for victory you were anointed for body changeing one of these days did one of these explosions is going to be too big oh and you're going to just Rapture out of here one of these days he's going to be pressing your buttons and he's going to be be pressing your buttons and he's going to press that wrong button one of these days oh and your theophany is going to soar out of here oh and you ain't never going to have to battle it again you ain't never going to have to fight again oh but you're going to be able to stand before God and say Lord you sent the Devils oh they sent the trials they sent the storms oh but there was an anointing there that stood for me there was an anointing there that made sure that I saw Victory there was an anointing there that made sure that I overcame oh I see this morning you you will see Victory you will see overcoming you will see the sunlight at the end of the storm oh because you were anointed to see that Victory oh hallelujah oh man I don't know some of y'all too well but when I look across this building I know there are some testimonies I see some testimonies in Fai Tabernacle I see some testimonies all across this building testimonies that the anointing stood for you oh the doctor said there's no way the doctor said you ain't coming out of this oh but you're in this building this morning because the anointing said you're getting back up the anointing said you are coming out of this come on Fai Tabernacle he sent Church in difference he seing Church problems oh but there is an anointing in the building here this morning I say fi Tabernacle was anointed to see Victory but Tabernacle was anointed oh to stand and say there ain't no church issue there ain't no church problem there ain't no sickness there ain't no devil there ain't no Spirit there ain't no complex oh that's going to stop this briad body from moving forward oh Hallelujah that devil told brother shmay and sister bethan for 20 years that they couldn't have a baby oh but I see there was an anointing that's been placed upon their lives and there is a beautiful baby boy that send at home this morning I to tell him the devil when the anointing is your enemy there is nothing that can stop short of killing that devil oh I see we got some testimonies in this building that the anointing stood for you the anointing fought for you the anointing stood there and said that Devil's told him he can't overcome oh but I'm going to prove I'm going to put that devil on notice I'm going to make an example of that devil oh that when the anointing comes inside oh of a word body oh there is going to be some victory amen oh hallelujah oh that sickness was anointed by Satan to defeat you oh that Depression was anointed by Satan to destroy you that devil was anointed by Satan to kill you that suicide was anointed by Satan to take you out of here oh that you church that that that sness was anointed by the devil oh to make sure that you don't see Victory oh but I say there was another anointing there is a holy ghost anointing there is a pure word anointing that has been placed upon your life oh when that anointing overcomes every anointing of the devil oh people say well you got to be careful and preach about the anointing cuz brother bernon preached anointed ones at the end time and you know just because you're anointed don't mean that you're that you're ride just because you're well yeah I understand that I understand that but brother ream also said that if there was a fake if there was a false it's only because there had to be an original it's only because there had to be a true oh it's only because there had to be an original bride there had to be a perfect spotless Lamb of God it was going to die and it was going to make a spotless Perfect Bride of Jesus Christ oh and I believe I'm looking this morning before that very group of people I believe you have been placed under the anointing of God you have been placed in the message of the hour for a reason you weren't placed here for no reason you weren't placed here for no reason Church oh you weren't just placed here because your mom when Daddy was born into it you weren't placed here just because your granddaddy went to this church you weren't placed here just because it's it's just a family Lage to go here you weren't placed here just because you happened here one day oh but you were been placed here inside of this body because from before the foundation of the world there was an ano anting that was placed upon your life to to overcome there was an anointing placed upon your life to see Victory amen you look at Israel today the prophet of God said to watch Israel he said that it's their time piece he said Israel is the bride's time piece you look at Israel today they if you watch the news you see anything Israel's been in the middle of a battle for the last year constantly enemy after enemy rising up every single enemy that rises up every single enemy that comes against them Israel destroys them within hours Israel destroys them annihilates him just within a few hours because there's been an anointing that's been placed upon that Nation there's been an anointing that's been placed upon that group of people to overcome Hamas can't even replace their generals fast enough Hamas can't even put new Generals in fast enough before Israel wipes them out oh they can't even find somebody to replace them and by the time they do that Devil's already dead oh I say this morning Satan can't even replace his Devils fast enough oh before we're already cutting his head off oh sa can't even replace his generals he can't even replace his demons fast enough before this bride of Jesus Christ cuts his head off oh Hallelujah I heard a story the other day oh where Hamas where Israel posted a picture of the 11 leaders of Hamas and in this picture Israel has circled five of their heads in red and the footnote at the bottom said so far this is how many we've killed so far this is how many we killed in other words we're putting you on notice the rest of you guys y'all better go home and make sure your life insurance is ready oh because come morning time we're going to be one dead devil closer to seeing Victory oh I want to put that devil on notice this morning we've killed the devil to the left of you we've killed the devil to the right of you I say you better get ready devil cuz morning is coming and when morning comes oh I say we're going to be one dead devil closer to Victory oh you better watch out devil there is some anointing in this building there is some power in this building there is some Holy Ghost fi members of the Bride of Jesus Christ oh when I say you better watch out devil we're putting you on notice we're going to kill you oh just like we killed depression just like we killed suicide just like we killed pornography just like we killed complexes oh whatever Devil's coming against you I say we're going to kill him oh because there is an anointing that has been placed upon you to see Victory amen hallelujah in this going back to that sermon why are people so tossed about in this message he would take some time and dwell in that anointing and you know like we were talking about while ago he would talk about the anointing being the supreme power in control he would say you know God would give the supreme power to the body of Christ through that anointing that would Channel it I say this tonight this this morning the anointing is in control whatever you're doing with the anointing is in control whatever you're bound the anointing is in control you ain't got to worry about take your hands off of it that's one of the hardest ways to fight sometimes is When God says take your hands off of it Caleb take a step back don't worry about it I've already given you the victory I've already fought the Battle for you I've already won the battle the anointing is in control just take a step back Cale take your hands off of it oh the anointing is in control maybe I'm just hear somebody tell somebody this morning the anointing is in control the anointing is in power over your life the anointing is in perfect control oh my there's power in knowing who you are knowing that you are anointed knowing that you ain't got to stand in worry you ain't got to stand in nervousness you ain't got to stand there in anxiety wondering if you're going to overcome wonder if you're going to make it through another day wondering if you're going to come through this you ain't got to worry about that because you know that you were anointed the prophet of God would say time and time again that David knew he was anointed in one place he said David knew he was anointed he was Vindicated to be a good shot he know that they know that he was a good shot David wasn't anointed and he knowed it in another place David know the anointing oil was on him and it didn't make any difference he said the Philistine will be like the bear in The Lion so here I come another place he knowed where he was standing he was a man of Faith he believed that God was in him he knew he was anointed Church there's power knowing you were anointed David didn't win because he was strong David didn't win because he was educated David didn't win because he knew how to aim because he knew how to throw David didn't win because he had a strong arm oh but David saw Victory because knew he was anointed David overcame because he knew that he was anointed the prophet of God said when you recognize who you are when you recognize that anointing you will be an invincible Army oh no devil in hell will be able to stand against you no devil in hell will be able to stop you whenever you can come and you can get the revelation of who you are amen David was anointed he knew he was anointed he knew his position he knew he had found favor David he God himself said David is a man after my own heart brother bam said that David was anointed to portray Christ David was you know when you think about the anointed in the Old Testament many times you think of David David was very very anointed he was placed into that anointing and now we want to skip ahead 300 years we're going to skip ahead five generations and you look over in 2 Kings 19 we ain't got to go through and read it all but if you're reading this story here we are 300 years after David's left the scene five generations after David had left the scene and now Assyria has come up against Judah and King Jehosaphat was a Godly King and he went to the prophet of God and he said ask what we should do and now in in Second Kings this was the Lord's response he said I will give you victory for my servant David's sake for my servant David's sake I will give you Victory and the Bible says that night the spirit of the Lord which the prophet said was the anointing went out and killed 185,000 Assyrians that night 185,000 Assyrians and you know I got a thinking about that if a 300y old anointing if a five generation old anointing oh have been been placed upon David after 300 years that that anointing has so much power and so much Authority after 300 years years that it could kill 185,000 Devils oh what about a fresh anointing that's been placed upon this bride what about a fresh anointing that's been placed upon the Bride of Jesus Christ oh I say there ain't no limit to what you can do there ain't no limit to how you can overcome there ain't no limit to how how much you can see Victory oh church I say I ain't using Granddaddy's anointing I ain't using Daddy's anointing I ain't using that anointing oh it was just for people in this Bible oh but I have been given a fresh anointing of the word and I say of an anointing given to great great great granddaddy David could kill 185,000 then I ain't got to worry about anything that I'm going through because I know that there was an anointing that was in this building this morning and that anointing will overcome that anointing will carry me through it that anointing will take a hold over every devil that anointing will go out in the night and when morning comes Israel do the spoil there is a dead army laying outside your Gates because there is an anointing that fought for you there's an anointing that stood for you oh I love how the Bible said it he said that the anointing went out that night and then they arose in the morning oh I imagine King Jehoshaphat slept very good that night oh I imagine last couple months he ain't got no sleep oh he knows this arm is coming he can't sleep tossing and turning the arm's here he's tossing and turning the arm is preparing for battle he's tossing and turning oh but this night he laid his head down oh to the sound of his enemies crying for help he went to the sound of the anointing slaughtering the enemy that come before him oh I say church maybe you're going through the dark of night maybe you're going through a dark time through a dark period oh but I just want to give you some encouragement this morning and say morning is coming I say morning is coming and the anointing is going to kill every enemy that's come up against you the anointing is going to slay that enemy the anointing is going to slay that Army the anointing is going to fight for you the anointing is going to stand for you oh Church there is an anointing that's been placed upon this bride oh you can overcome you can say you ain't got to worry about it the anointing killed 185,000 Devils all because a great great great grandpa was anointed oh what about you what does God think about you he has placed a fresh anointing upon this bride oh and I ain't got to worry about what Grandpa did I ain't got to worry about what Dad did oh but I know that I am anointed I know that I am filled with the Holy Ghost I know that I am a member of the Bride body of Jesus Christ and I know that I was anointed to see Victory amen going back to the scripture we begin with is 10:24 therefore thus sayith the Lord God of hosts oh my people that dwelleth in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall smite thee with the rod he shall lift up a staff against thee after the manner of Egypt for he had a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction and the Lord of H host shall stir up a Scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of orb according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of orb sometimes when the anointing comes to fight your battle it gets a little bit messy oh but the slaughter of midan the rock of orb now this story is referring to Gideon when 300 soldiers killed 185,000 midianites and during this battle these 300 men completely destroyed this Army of Midian and so because of it the general of this Army runs and he hides in the rock of Orab he runs and he tries to hide from this Army he tries to hide and he goes to get away oh but I want to just make a declaration to that devil this morning oh when the anointing is after you there ain't nowhere you can run to get away from it oh when the anointing is fighting for you when the anointing is against you there ain't no rock you can shelter in there ain't no Fortress that can hold you there ain't no but building that will hold you there ain't no Rock that'll hold you there ain't no place that'll hold you when the anointing is against you oh because not only did the anointing kill Orab not only did that anointing kill that man oh but he named that rock after the man that was killed there he named that rock the rock of Orab because the anointing slew Orab right there at that rock oh I say this morning and now 300 years later we see Isaiah is talking to the prophet oh and he said don't worry I want you to look back to the rock of Orab I want you to look back at the memorial that I made for your people I want you to look back that the rock of Orab oh where a man said the anointing wasn't enough and I showed him that the anointing wasn't enough where a man said the anointing can't protect this people oh but I showed him that the anointing can protect this group of people oh I say not only did the anointing kill your devil but he said I'm going to make a memorial I'm going to name a rock after your devil oh this morning if you're going through something why don't you just turn around and look back to the Rock I say look to the rock of Orab look to the rock of depression without enemy try to get you but the anointing said no look back to the rock of complexes where they tried to kill you but the anointing said no look back to the rock of suicide without that enemy tried to kill you oh but the anointing said No I say that he not only killed your devil he made an example of your devil he made a memorial of your devil oh church you can turn around tonight oh and just look back at where he brought you from just look back at what the anointing has carried you through oh just look back at the rock of Orab look back at the Rock oh I have so many rocks now look back oh I can't even see my past there's so many rocks I can't even see where I was because there are so many rocks I can't even see what I used to go through because there are so many rocks that every time I came against something the anointing killed that devil the anointing overcame the anointing by Victory oh I say maybe you should drive a take down tonight or drive a take down this morning and say devil you battle me long enough or with the anointing is here the anointing is in this building and the anointing is going to overcome oh Hallelujah I'm going to make this rock a memorial oh fear not bride look to the rock look to the Rock I love I was looking at what I was doing some research on this and there was a a a Biblical historian who wrote on this rock of orb a little bit and I love this excerpt that he said he said orb fell at a rock which became known afterwards as the rock of Orab this incident not only marked a Victorious turning point for the Israelites but it also devastatingly impacted the midianite influence in the region to the point where this is the last time in history where Midian was ever a threat to the nation of Israel oh Hallelujah you know what that means that means whenever the midianites try to come back in Israelites said hey hang on a minute why don't you go look at the rock of Orab before you make any rash decisions devil why don't you just go back to the memorial oh before you decide you want to march on God's people why don't you just go back to the rock of Orab oh why don't you just go make sure that you really want to die again why don't you just make sure you really want to be defeated again oh because if my god did it once I say my God's going to do it again if the anointing overcame once the anointing is going to overcome again my God is the same yesterday today and forever and if he overcame for one person he can do it for me if he overcame for you he can overcome for somebody else I say the anointing is here this morning to bring you you Victory the anointing is here this morning to make a memorial of the devil that you're battling the anointing is here oh don't pass by this anointing the anointing is here to carry you the anointing is here to fight for you oh you were made for this anointing you were made for this message God don't put people in this message oh that weren't made for this message oh but you were anointed you were predestinated you were for ordained oh to be a part of this message I say you were made for it yeah brother Brenham would tell a story about that duck in the chicken yard he would say that that duck was born there that that farmer laid that dug under that chicken and it created the right atmosphere where he could be born and that duck was raised there in that chicken yard and you know he went about his life trying his best to be a chicken oh but I love how the prophet said it he said the only problem he said was that chicken yard was dry and he said that duck was made for water that do was made for water and the prophet tells that story he's one day he's walking around that chicken yard oh he said all that it took was that duck to get one whiff of that pond all it took that duck was to get one just little one little sniff one little smell of that water all it took was one experience all it took was one exposure and the brother the prophet of God said he flew over that fence he spread his wings and he flew down to that water and he began to jump into that water and say I was made for this water I was made for this anointing I was made for this message I was made to bathe in this water I say tonight this morning morning I wasn't made for no chicken yard I wasn't made for no Dusty old pin I wasn't made for no dirty old lay out the see world oh I Was Made oh to swim in the waters of Victory I was made to swim in the pond of this message I was made oh to swim in this water oh Hallelujah the prob would tell another story about when he was a young boy oh after school they would all run down and they would jump into that water they will go jump into that pond brother Bram said he was always the first one there he said he didn't have no burdens to take off he didn't have no no clothes no shoes no socks nothing to take off he said all he had to do oh was just pull that nail in his overalls and shake a little bit oh and then just run into that water and he just jump right into that water oh and I love the way the prophet said it he said once I jump into that water he said I feel that water oh I'd feel it over my arms I'd feel it over my chest I feel it over my head and I would turn back and I'd say come on in boys the water's good come on in boys the wi's good I say the prophet was the first one in this message he was the first one to step his feet into the Waters of this message and he didn't just say oh it's just for me he didn't say it's just for 1965 he didn't say it's just for the prophet messenger he didn't say this is just for me oh but he turned back around to a people that were following him and he said come on in boys the water's good I say this morning come on in boys the water's good come on in the anointing feels good the anointing feels powerful the anointing feels like Victory the anointing feels like overcoming the anointing feels like Liberty come on in boys I say the water feels good oh I am a witness that this water feels good this message feels good oh and you know what I didn't just come and just get my toe wet and go oh this water feels good I didn't just go and just just get my ankle wet and go oh how that feels good I didn't just go and get my knee wet and go oh that water feels good oh but I dove into this message I dove into this anointing I dove into this water I say come on in boys the water feels good come on in church the water feels good this message has an anointing that anointing will carry you the anointing will bring you Victory the anointing will bring you overcoming you are anointed to see Victory oh come on Church the water feels good this morning oh you can jump on in oh I'll tell you a place you can jump on in you ain't got to worry about nothing else you ain't got to worry about going back to that chicken yard you ain't got to worry about going back to that lay seeing that lay seeing chicken pin you ain't got to worry about going back to that Dusty old world oh but you just get your feet wet in this water and you want to dive in oh you just get a little bit in this water oh just bathe in the anointing this morning just bathe in the word just bathe in the message of the hour I promise you you won't regret it oh because when the message of the hour oh because takes Revelation inside of you and that anointing that's placed upon you meets the spark of Revelation oh you're going to get so stimulated you never want to leave I say devil you're one day too late you can't get me to go back to that chicken yard I've already felt the water I've already felt the water of the anointing I've already felt the water of the message and I ain't never going back oh I say I've been out in the world I've felt the water of the world I've been in the chicken pin of the world oh I've been out there I ran as far as I could oh but I wouldn't trade all the money in the world oh for what I got this morning oh because I say the anointing feels good the anointing has held me the anointing has carried me the anointing has destroyed every obstacle the anointing has broke down every barrier the anointing has broke down every wall oh Church you were anointed to see Victory you were anointed to overcome you were anointed to come through this don't worry about it anymore don't fed about it anymore there's no reason to be nervous there's no reason to worry there's an anointing that's been placed upon you and that anointing is going to see you through amen as they'd come to the music oh that anointing will carry you amen the prophet of God said I believe we're fixing to see something here that you've never seen before I believe you're going to see one of the greatest burst of healings that you've ever seen I filled and in the light of God's word and the witness of the Holy Ghost we have the victory here tonight over
