it we're going to have a good time this morning amen and so it's just we're just glad and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians the first chapter praise the Lord book of Ephesians the first chapter and before we go into the word maybe we can just pray and and uh also uh brother Beale is sick this morning as well as sister uh and Abate both are sick and not feeling well so let's just take this before the Lord as we pray father as we stand here this morning realizing our need for you father we need you more now than we ever have and Lord we bring this brother and sister before your throne this morning and I pray that you had healed them father you see the the need that they have and what is ailing them Lord we don't take these things lightly Lord we've seen people just uh their lives end at a simple headache or whatever Lord but father we're we're looking to you that you would reach down your hand and just touch them and Satan we just command you to uh leave their bodies Lord and that they can just be well today father we thank you for for hearing our prayer and I pray father that you would be with us this morning in this part of the service God uh just Lord I'm nothing without you and we had asked that you had anoint the lips of clay and anoint the ears and hearts of your people to receive father may it all be done in thy name Lord we just love you give you glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord of the book of Ephesians the first chapter and start at the 15th verse is wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him now think of that they give you this is the prayer that Paul would have the burden is that the Lord would give you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding been enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power amen you can have your seats this morning what a prayer that Paul would pray and that was just that was his burden and and I think that's any true man of God's burden is that the people's eyes would be enlightened and the Lord would give give us the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him and you can certainly feel the passion the burden that brother Branham had as he is laying out the word and opening the Mysteries to us today I I'm going to continue on the Supernatural and that would be my title and we know that again God is a supernatural being that's that's what he is he is unseen in all of his works are Supernatural his presence is Supernatural everything he does is Supernatural and I I think this is the something that more than just being taught I I pray that it can really be down in our soul because uh if we're going to walk with God it it must you walk with the supernatural that means the Unseen is more real to you than the natural would be or what is seen and so wherever the Lord is the supernatural takes place brother Brown said wherever a supernatural being is he'll do Supernatural signs because the Supernatural is in him and he said you just can't get out of it you just can't get out of it so he says how can you stand in the face of wind without having wind blowing how can you get in water without being wet water's wet that's the chemical of it it's wet and so when you're when you get in water you're going to get wet right and so when you get in the presence of God the supernatural then there's going to be Supernatural signs and Supernatural workings of a supernatural God ain't that right and and so there's only one Supernatural God right amen we're not uh uh you know we're not serving three four five whatever uh the Bible says in the beginning was God in the beginning God created the heavens and earth ain't that right Deuteronomy 6 4 says Hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord he's one and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul with all thy might and so there's always been one true lord always being one God right and as we have talked last Sunday that God has hidden himself in different forms but he's always been the same God he has never changed and and so the the message of the hour has enabled us to look back beyond the beginning and see what God was before there ever was the beginning and how he's unfolded himself all the way up to this age and what other message can give that to you there there there's no other message that's been able to describe God from the beginning and all the way up to this age and and so John 1 1 very familiar and and very prominent in understanding God and that is in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God and and so but as the prophet would tell us before it became a word it was a thought ain't that right it was the thoughts of God and so the word is the thoughts of God expressed God thought it then he spoke it and it became word ain't that right well so then John tells us that the word is God the word is God and so then the prophet would tell us see the whole thing is God unfolding himself in his attributes so the Eternal thoughts of God was about himself can you say Amen unfolding himself in his attributes and of course we are his what attributes and then God being made material tangible ain't that right amen so God unfolding himself in his attributes of course he's he's love he's he's healer Savior and God unfolding himself in these things but but we were part of them thoughts too amen because God had to have a body ain't that right amen and you know good and well as we know that he's not just pouring himself just to anybody it's his attributes it's his thoughts you either was in his thoughts in the beginning or you're not ain't that right so we are his thoughts today we are his thoughts made manifest it's what God wanted to be God wanted to be tangible ain't that right God wanted to be tangible so he so so who who did he have he had the lamb he had Jesus Christ ain't that right but we Jesus Christ wasn't the only only thought that he had in his mind we were in his thoughts as well ain't that right Jesus was in his thoughts as Redeemer we were in his thoughts as redeemed ain't that right so it's God unfolding himself in his attributes and then God being made material tangible that we can talk to speak with in his whole church body and everything ain't that right well Jesus God uh he was the tabernacle a man that God dwelt in ain't that right that human body God was in his human body and yet Jesus had to pray and and and brother Brandon says yes he had to pray All Flesh has to pray that's what the Bible says amen so who was he talking to he was praying to the God within him ain't that right he's praying not to God up in heaven he was praying to the god in him so so then another place brother Brown says in him was thoughts in God was thought he wanted to become material and what did he do then he spoke a word and the Word was materialized that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation ain't that right what's the picture he wants to become tangible he wants to become visible he he he wants to become material and so the word that was spoken a man from Genesis to Revelation gives us the whole picture of it God change it in forms and and and and these things into where we are today so so it's hell Elohim uh uh materializing so that he can be touched he can be felt and and these things so then that was the word in the beginning and the word became flesh the word became flesh ain't that right see so God had already said through the prophet Isaiah that his word would not return unto him void but that it would accomplish that which he sent it to do and it would perform amen and and prosper so when the word came to David it was God in David when the word come to Isaiah it was God in Isaiah do you believe that amen see God was showing what he was after the word coming Amen to to uh Moses that was God coming in Moses ain't that right amen the word coming to Joseph it was God in Joseph not God sending his word amen but God coming Amen in and and and and that's why brother Brandon would say if you can't see Christ in every scripture then go read it again because it was Christ and every one of them men it was Christ ain't that right there their own lives you know when they were man they were men amen and we can see that they were men look at all the mistakes they made but when they were anointed they were God they're but they're flesh their own lives testified of God ain't that right testified of Jesus Christ ain't that right David did David testified of Jesus Christ yet yet as a man when he was man look at all the failures but when that anointing Came Upon him God would testify through his life of what he wanted Joseph and Moses and all them men see so the word came to all the prophets and it was God doing the speaking and the acting in them men ain't that right so the word is God but it never said that the word became flesh until Jesus Christ came ain't that right the word never became flesh until Jesus Christ came because everything that was in David was in Christ everything all the god that anointed and came into Joseph was in Christ everything that they talked about their lives portrayed it was in Christ ain't that right amen it was Christ and it all so all that God was he poured into Christ the god in David was in Christ the god in Moses was in Christ the God and all of them men and and and they they were in Christ last Sunday we talked about God hiding behind skin and he was veiled uh in the Old Testament uh behind the badger skin and and by faith the people knew that he was in there and they would approach uh um uh the the Tabernacle by faith but then he was veiled in another skin God would Veil himself in another skin which is the body of Jesus Christ and God created his own body and poured himself into it and became human brother Branham said God occupied a three-room house bodies sow and spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and he came notice he came to take on himself the full form of man ain't that right the full form of man to redeem the full form of man back to God that's why he come in flesh and in Soul he come the full form of man become That Body Soul spirit that he might redeem the full form of man oh my God so we we find that First Timothy 3 16 it says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifesting flesh you realize that's still a mystery it's still a mystery today the mystery of godliness Colossians 2 9 in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily people people have tried for years and they're still trying to separate the name of Jesus Christ from God but it is impossible to do it because Jesus was God now I want you to bear with me listen to me now John 5 43 says I come in my father's name that's what Jesus said I come in my father's name so the name of the father is Jesus Christ ain't that right amen for the father was in him remember Jesus said as I sin as the father has sent me so sin are you and and the prophet would ask how did the father send him he went with him even in him and as the father sent him so he sends you can you say Amen so so Jesus bore the father's name because God was in him John 1 18 no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him we've we've read these John 14 8 Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and Jesus said unto him have I been so long time with you and yet thou has not known me and Philip say me Philip he that has seen me has seen the father I'll sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works John 10 30. Jesus says I and my father are one can you say Amen so what God had in his mind in the beginning remember brother I'm talking about Michelangelo and the sculptor and what he had in his mind Jesus was that masterpiece ain't that right God was able to become tangible and what happened the supernatural took place amen in Hebrews 10 20 Paul tells us that the Flesh of Jesus was the Veil now throughout the Bible God has had many titles he is called our righteousness our peace ever present he is called father he is called son he is called the Holy Ghost he is called the I am he was called the Jehovah and the prophet you know he someone had asked him about it about the the names of God and and brother Brown said the names of God has been changed all the way through the Old Testament until it came to Jesus Christ ain't that right that's right and these titles that has been given him depict what he is to Mankind and what he can do he is peace but he is Supernatural peace because God is Supernatural he is Joy but he is a supernatural Joy ain't that right that's right see and and and even in that Supernatural piece look at what the world calls peace and they're crying out for peace yet the peace that they get doesn't quelch the the turmoil it doesn't stop anything but when the peace of God comes it can come in the middle of the worst Havoc of your life and give you such a peace that no devil in hell can torment you it's a supernatural piece can you say amen for God is Supernatural he is provider but the way he provides is Supernatural can you say Amen everything may be yeah your bills maybe just be piling up and you don't know what to do right but when God comes on the seeds and begins to provide it'll leave you speechless you don't know how it happened but he did it because God is Supernatural you believe it needs nothing he can create what is needed by speaking his word look what he'd done for Abraham for example Abraham needed a ram he needed a sacrifice and at the time he needed it sometimes I I don't know sometimes God just Waits and waits and waits and waits sometimes he'll wait till the last second now you remember Abraham going up that mountain he already testified me and the lad will return and then I Isaac asked Him Father I see everything I see all this stuff for sacrifice where's that sacrifice and he didn't tell Isaac well you're that sacrifice he said Son God will provide himself God will provide himself a sacrifice why would he say it himself because God's the one that gave the promise Isaac was a promise from God Abraham it didn't matter to God it wasn't or it wasn't up to Abraham Amen to keep that sacrifice alive or Isaac alive it was God's promise so therefore he knew that God would provide his own self a sacrifice because God wouldn't let his own word die he would let his own word fail so Abraham I mean look God waited till the very last second he built the sacrifice he built it or built the altar he built everything and delayed his son on that altar not worrying one bit about it and there he grabbed that dagger anyway with all the force he was gonna going to uh uh slay his own son and at that time God withstayed his hand thank you and he turned around there's the ramp God provided and sometimes when you don't know what to do and when you're at your lowest point and you just think you're gonna and God ain't seeming to answer you hang on God has proven in this Bible that he is Supernatural and he's not moved by your time he's not moved by my time he's not by move by your situation he can move when the most impossible situation there is look at the Hebrew voice amen you know the prophet describes it three three steps he was not there two steps he wasn't there one step he wasn't there but when they walked in that fire there he was that's just God he's on time can you say Amen so he's Supernatural now so but uh so he's all of these things the seven Redemptive names and the I am and and and on and on and on we could go he's called The Rock and and these things but when he poured himself into the body of Jesus Christ he took on a human name and all that God was he poured in there and that human name represented every title that God ever had that human name is that right in Jesus dwelt the prince of peace the Everlasting father Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Nissi ain't that right listen even John 14 27 tells the tells the the his disciples peace I leave with you well how can he leave that peace what is he going to do come up with movies so people get their mind off of the turmoils come on bro what's he gonna do I'll write a bunch of books so people can just just hide themselves off in a room and read and read and read and forget about their troubles that's not peace what's he gonna do give him a vacation plan send them to the Bahamas and say that's my peace no he God was in him and it was God speaking through that body that would say peace I leave with you my peace I've given to you not as the world giveth is it give I unto you why because the Prince of Peace the Prince of Peace was veiled in that body ain't that right so all the titles that God ever had are titles to one name Jesus Christ ain't that right listen Zechariah 14 9 and the Lord shall be king over all the Earth in that day there shall be one Lord and his name one one Lord and his name one right amen see so the prophet said if you were baptized in the name of Jehovah Rapha or Jehovah Jireh or any of those titles it would have to be Jesus Christ not yahshaway Jesus Christ we had that one young brother that coming in you know and of course you know his his Pastor got him you know secluded them little old church even though there's other message people around they come you know trying to convince us it was yahshua yahshua is to correct and I told him I said but a prophet told us Jesus Christ the Bible tells us Jesus Christ we'll stay with that ain't that right see all the titles the names that ever belonged to God was made one human name the Lord Jesus Christ you believe that can we say that again all the titles and every name that God had came under one name the Lord Jesus Christ ain't that right showing that you don't need to call upon Jehovah Jireh and Jehovah Rapha and Jehovah Shalom and Jehovah whatever you need and for whatever God is to you just call on the name of Jesus Christ he'll give you peace he'll give you salvation he'll deliver you he'll be your Victory he'll be your banner he'll be your life he'll be your provider can you say Amen the Lord Jesus Christ every Supernatural part of God is in that name [Applause] Colossians 3 17 and whatsoever you do in word or deep do all everybody say do all in the name of the Lord Jesus now what is Jesus brother Brown said Jesus is God's Redemption name ain't that right acts 4 12 tells us that there is no salvation in any other name there's no salvation in Jehovah Jireh no salvation in Jehovah shalom hello there ain't no salvation and I am that I am just as much as there's no salvation in Buddha there there's no salvation at all any other name no other name there's no other name can you say Amen there is no salvation in any other name for their for there is no other name under Heaven among given among men whereby we must be saved Jesus Christ is God's Redemption name amen so God's only name is Jesus Christ and what is Jesus Christ again the word made flesh keep that in your mind the word made flesh well the brand said what is it it's the true interpretation of the word what is the word made flesh the true interpretation of the word ain't that right so the name of God is in the word because he is the word so what is he then the prophet would ask the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God yeah now listen now because he says where two or three are gathered in my name I'm gonna be there you can't separate God from his name oh goodness gathered in my name what is he then the word interpreted everybody say the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God oh brother Brown said he is God's chosen place of worship and God's name is given to him he is God's place of worship and God's name is given to him he is the word of God he is the name of God hello see he is both word of God and name of God he is the he was the word made flesh you're with me he was the word of God Lamb of God name of God and was God that's what he was the Chosen and only place of worship to God now we know there is not one denomination that manifests the name of God of Jesus Christ right why because they're not the interpretation of the word they're not the true interpretation of the true word of God and they are not the interpretation and they're not interpreting the word of God so people are manifesting the name of their denomination so they manifest the name of Baptist they manifest the name of UPC they manifest the name of apostolic or whatever Assemblies of God or Pentecostal or what whatever they they manifest because they have become the interpretation of what their denomination teaches man right they they they're manifesting the name of Baptist because they've come become the interpretation of what the Baptist teaches that's why brother bran would say I'd ask him are you Christian well I'm Baptist are you Christian well I'm Methodist I didn't ask you that I asked you if you're a Christian well I'm Catholic ain't that right now notice John 5 43 Jesus said I come in my father's name and you receive me not three if another shall come in his own name him will you receive is that not true for today [Applause] they'll receive the name of Baptist they'll receive the name of Pentecostal they'll received the name of Presbyterian hello but according to Revelation 17 3 them names are names of blasphemy they're Blasphemous names there's only one thing no wonder the prophet would hit that thing so hard if you're Baptist and you're expecting to go to heaven because of that name there's no other name you don't want to bear that name in Deuteronomy 16 God tells the people that their sacrifice will only be accepted in the place the Lord chooses to place his name and so notice in Jesus day there were thousands of people who worshiped at their churches back then it was called synagogues but we call it churches today and there was thousands of them that would go to their churches and and and not one time do you ever hear of them getting saved getting healed getting delivered there's no record of it but there was one woman who worshiped where the word was being interpreted then you say Amen the place where God had placed his name and she was forgiven of her sins and you say Amen she was forgiven of her sins notice when the believer who was blind came to the word where the word was being interpreted which was the place that God had placed his name the blind Saul when the believer who had evix a daughter vix with the devil came to where the word was being interpreted the place where God placed his name her daughter was made whole at that same hour when the interpretation of the word the place where God placed his name came and stood at the grave of Lazarus a man that had been dead for days his soul was on a journey four days out yet that same word brought that man back to life again sir yes sir man never heard it at other churches it was where the word was being interpreted it was where the manifestation of the word was that had the name of God for God was with him in him can you say Amen John 14 10 Jesus said the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works ain't that right so no wonder God was pleased to have his name there because the name now we all know the name represents your character it it the name represents your nature it the name represents who you really are your name brother Brian said there's so much value in a name that's why I tell them you know if you gotta if you got a child named Ricky or Elvis change that name change it change it to number one change it to whatever but but don't call him Ricky Don't call them Elvis He said and there's never been an age that that name has been used Elvis all right till this age ain't that right it's what he said so see God was in the place where he placed his name and showed that he was there by his Supernatural works brother Brown said the perfect manifestation of God in the Sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works so again the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works and they were not human uh what was a humanitarian works they were Supernatural works not humanitarian it was a Supernatural Ministry he manifested a supernatural life he spoke Supernatural words he did Supernatural things and you say Amen he raised the dead he opened the eyes of the blind he said at Liberty those who were bound he healed the Brokenhearted he fulfilled all prophecy that was spoke of him he performed the sign of the Messiah these were the works of God do you believe it Supernatural and he couldn't have done it if he wasn't the word it's the word that produces the works of God because it is God ain't that right so again God was perfectly manifested in Jesus Christ by the indwelling spirit manifesting the word in word and works now I want to go back to our opening scripture Ephesians 1 22. and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body ain't that right then what does it say the fullness of him everybody say the fullness of him that feel is all in all so what is the fullness of him the church which is his body is the fullness of him right as I've told you before in the creation of Adam you see Adam and spirit form because God said let us make man in our own image man existed in spirit then you find we see Adam in flesh form hello the spirit of Adam became in that body of Flesh that God wasn't done yet we see Adam in another form and that's bride form can you say Amen she wasn't another creation she was just the fullness of Adam she was what was in Adam now she was the expression of Adam in so much that her name was Adam so what is the church the spiritual body of Jesus Christ and it is made up of human beings but the human beings were attributes of God before the foundation of the world God not only wanted a body so he could redeem man he wanted a wife he wanted to be wife great is the mystery of godliness hello so God is unfolding himself he's not manifesting a church he's manifesting himself and the church is his body hello so how do we become part of the body First Corinthians 12 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body right that's right see and what is the church the Tabernacle of God [Music] becoming tangible amen I have to say you know that out of all the New Testament Church ages now I know that people you know there are some saying that there's that well you know one spoke the other day and said that you know it's just been confusing to him about bright age and are we in laodicea are we in Broad age what are we and he said he got down into prayer and and God spoke to him and said it's no different than what it's been in every other age there's always been a bright age in every age that is not what the prophet said so I don't care who spoke to him it wasn't the god of the prophet hello because we've been climaxing climaxing the prophet said this is the greatest age ever and I want to say this is the greatest condition that the church has ever been in she has come to the height of of what God has wanted in her can you say Amen not God just dwelling in portion of his church that God dwelling in his fullness in the church hello that's right you say well what about the days of Acts what about Pentecostal that was the seed form that's what God started in seed form that you are not seed form you are a matured bride of Christ you are the complete thought of God can you say amen and there's never been a bright age but this age there's never been a Perfection of the church like it is in this age can you say Amen that's just where I feel and that's the way I see it in the message see the church is the Tabernacle of God it's the veil that God hides in himself himself in so God not only one looking at Jesus as a body but he was looking Beyond Jesus he was looking Beyond it he said now this is going to be my masterpiece and so through David and all these he began to talk about Jesus their lives portrayed Jesus Christ and when he come God poured himself into that bottle ain't that right that his thoughts just didn't stop there because Jesus says I must go away but I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you ain't that right and the world not going to see me anymore but you'll see me at that day you'll know that I'm in the father you and me and I in you ain't ain't that right so now Jesus the god in that body that human body is now talking of another body [Music] ain't that right now so we find great notice what Paul says great is the mystery of godliness and I hope that I hope I'm making sense to you great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in flesh God always keeps the people wandering the unbeliever is so stumped right but the believer recognizes him not by his body but by what he is in that body they'll recognize the supernatural God is there by the supernatural works ain't that right that woman at the well knew she was expecting she knew the Messiah would come with a supernatural sign and when he performed it she saw it the others they didn't know they were still looking for God behind the badger skin and the world today is still stumped because they're looking for a God that was 2 000 years ago in a Corporal body physical body and they don't know God's moved on into his spiritual body the supernatural body the church today say the mystery continues Colossians 1 25 whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages from Generations but has now made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among who the Jews nope the Samaritans nope you see it was what was made manifest to them was God in Christ God in Christ he performed a sign that Supernatural sign to the Jew and he performed the super natural sign to that Samaritan both the prophet said both raises of people got that Supernatural sign but that Supernatural sign had never yet been declared to the Gentiles yet but this mystery would be known in this day and that mystery is Christ in you can you say Amen Christ in you the hope of glory the same sign that God did before Abraham is the same sign that he'd done in Jesus Christ that body is the same sign he done in this age not through a word born body but a redeemed born body not a created body but a redeemed body a sex-born body that was redeemed and you say Amen now it's letting us know it's letting us know where we're at the mystery is revealed Christ in you the hope of glory can you say Amen yeah not church member Christ in you Lord have mercy if you go back to the uh future home of the uh you know the bridegroom an Earthly bride and brother Brad begins to talk on that Eighth Day and I know I know people have gone so far out on that Eighth Day and now it's gotten to the place that if you mention eight day everybody just their hackles raised and say oh I hear you just Brother Brad was the one that brought the Eighth Day in and if you really go listen to that he's he's talking about the Earth he's talking about the world but he's also talking about you can you say Amen remember he has passed he he that is in Christ uh old things are passed away behold All Things become new he is a new creation new creature in Christ he's passed from Death unto life and brother Brown said see we passed we're Beyond keeping Commandments we're beyond the laws of do's and don'ts we're beyond all of these things we're back into eternity what God thought of you in the beginning here you are you is always saved before the foundation of the world we're back in God's mind you never had a beginning and you'll never have an ending you are the attribute of God can you say Amen you are what God had in his mind you can never be a sinner again not if you're sealed you can never be a sinner again God Ain't Gonna Save you and pour his own life in you and then lose you and he has to depart from you he's with you that's your token can you say man that's the token that this bride has notice because I think this is really interesting or I got excited as someone a brother had sent it on a Minister's chat Reverend said I'm not Oneness not at all I'm not Trinity either I'm a Christian I believe in God and I believe in God I believe in God manifested in three offices now everybody say now his office is in my heart it's in your heart not under God somewheres another God somewheres else another God somewheres else that's Pagan as Pagan can be remember what brother Brown said deities not in heaven deity is in you ah yes sir now the prophet said this is there's there's so many infallible proofs that Jesus is the place he is the gate he is the name and the only provided way that God has for man to meet in worship he is the way the truth the life the gate the door the alpha the Omega the beginning the ending the rules of Sharon the lily of the valley the Morning Star the Alpha and Omega praise God the Alpha and Omega you realize you're putting right in that he is all everybody say he is all the whole thing put together he is both root and offspring of David the Brighton Morning Star in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily where we in there are Sons and Daughters of God where in the godhead in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily wherein there we are Sons and Daughters of God you're not Sons and Daughters of God by Earthly parents you're not Sons and Daughters of God by Earthly things programs don't make you a son and daughter of God pizza parties don't make you a son of daughter of God signing your name on a road doesn't make you a son and daughter of God and just believing God sent a prophet doesn't make you a son or daughter of God but being part of the godhead you're part of God hello in him in him that's why you got to be in him birth in him and you say Amen now notice in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily where in there our sons and daughters of God in God's godhead as Sons and Daughters we are in the family God wanted to be family right that's Eternal thoughts so that's what makes us work [Music] if you wasn't predestinated to begin with you'll never be worked if Jesus wasn't predestinated the Lamb of God the Messiah he couldn't be word but because he was the one that God had in his mind he was the Tabernacle of God he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he was the one that all the prophet spoke of and in him well the fullness of the godhead bodily yes sir and the word became flesh hello the deal is the word's becoming flesh again the word is becoming flesh again that means she's bearing her name his name that's why only a prophet could do it not denomination they'd call you Baptists they'd call you this but he called you miss Jesus Christ can you say Amen because he knew the thoughts of God was becoming tangible God becoming tangible again not in the physical body of Jesus Christ but in a in a a mini-membered body of Jesus Christ see as Sons and Daughters were in the family if you're in there Glory Glory Glory I'm excited no wonder you're going to conquer no wonder the devil's trying to get you he tried to get Jesus too he couldn't get Jesus and he can't get you he can he got his feather sins one time and he's getting his feathers singed again the same God we're part of that same thought [Music] s Holiness standards don't make your sons and daughters being in the godhead makes you sons and daughters Glory Glory I hope it makes sense to you Ephesians 3 14 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom say it with me the whole family in heaven and Earth is named what are you named what's your name that's what Paul's saying of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named notice acts 15 14 Simon Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name right Satan's trying to put the name of Baptist you have to forgive me but it's it's just truth and maybe there's someone denominational person that's watching there ain't no other name them names are Blasphemous names that are of the devil to get you away from the name of Jesus Christ you cannot bear the name of Baptist and and have power in the name of Jesus Christ you must bear the name of Jesus Christ for that name is tied to God and God Alone can you say man well it's true not all the Gentiles are going to have his name but he has taken out from the Gentiles a people for his name and when is this done Revelations 18 6 and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people do you realize never has that been done never has that been uttered never has that been a a a fulfillment of scripture until this age I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you received not of her plagues now notice how does he move them out how how God the prophet says Al Hosea says he Hume them out how do you come out God has to do it himself how else can you come out of the Traditions that you were in it took God to do that foreign I'm telling you the devil's got such a stronghold in them Creeds and traditions and darkness of men and it's so powerful that it blinds men even though God would do something right before their eyes it takes God to go in there and do a hewing out but that's what the Bible says that God took out a people for his name and God says I have viewed them out by the prophets the book of Hosea and this word huge means chopped he chopped Israel out from the rest of the Nations and how does he do it by his two-edged sword his word ain't that right see by the prophets who had the Vindicated word he chopped his Nation from the rest of the Nations in this last day God has chopped his bride from the denominations by his Prophet by his word promised in Malachi 4. ain't that right what has he done he has hewed himself out a bride from the rest of the churches that right remember in the Old Testament the prophet took the word that came to him and chopped Israel out and he told them Moses told told them separate yourself from the rest of them see they want to act like the rest of the Nations they wanted a king they wanted to be like everybody else ain't that right brother Brown said it's just like the churches today they say we believe the word but then turn around say well we should do this and we should do that and we should do this totally against the word hello and the problem says I don't care what they say the words right now that's where the bride is right now I don't care what they have to say the words right why we've been hewed out he's chopping her out by the word they say we should use titles to baptize that's not what the prophet taught right they say there's been a bride age in every bride age in every age that's not what the prophet taught they want to tell us there's two Lords that's not what the prophet taught they want to tell us there's two Souls that's not what the prophet taught and you say Amen they say your theophany isn't already in existence but it's just uh that it's only in the mind of God and then when you get there you'll get it that's not what the prophet taught and you say Amen they say the Holy Ghost is a psychologist that's not what the prophet taught [Applause] surely you can say Amen to that too you say well you're just hammering someone no I'm telling you the Prophet hewed this bride out hello they say men that's married two or three times can preach that's not what the prophet taught can you say Amen now listen Church brother Brown said Christ never sent me to build organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they may be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word hello you can't be uh uh the stature of a perfect man uh built to that without the word you cannot beat the PowerHouse and Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit without the word it's all by the word that's why God would send a prophet in this age is this all right see build up the individual to that place who's going to do it priest nope Pope nope a prophet with the message it's the message that is building us up not to intellectualism not to where we know it all then we get bored with church and we just now we're just looking around fussing and fighting and arguing that's not a people that's hewed out [Music] he said not build an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea what's the idea of the message to build Sons and Daughters of God up to where they become the PowerHouse of God they they they become the living Place Dwelling Place of the Spirit by his word and brother Graham said when the bride will get back to being a word bride amen was he not a word man Jesus Christ was he not a word man he was a word individual the word was made flesh so when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced notice brother Brown called her a word bride ain't that right a word bride see so when she returns to being a word bride she will then produce the very works that Jesus produced now notice now I'm going to be closing here in a minute but the prophet said God's body United as his bride being one listen now being one so we're not looking at a Jesus of yesterday two thousand years ago the bride and Christ are one so I said God's body United as his bride being one him and Christ together is the spirit working in the flesh of the church like like everybody say like it worked in the flesh of Jesus so as I was saying earlier there has been no no Ministry outside this ministry Paul Saint Martin any of them like the ministry of Jesus Christ none that's the ministry that is Promised for our day that's the minute that's the very works The Works that I do shall you do also never has that been fulfilled for this until this day and I know people will debate on me on that one but with me on that one but I'm telling you that the brother Branham brought these promises to life for our day this day so he says see like it worked in the flesh of Jesus Christ because it's part of his body not Twain but one they are one husband and wife is no longer two but one and Christ and his body is one and the same spirit that was in Christ is in his bride in his body that unites them together with all the words that's what connects you to every promise spoken of this age Christ in you makes you one [Music] then you say Amen to God and the same spirit that was in Christ is in his bride in his body that unites them together with all the word and God living in there himself manifesting it you're just the body oh if I could just be a Christian just be the body oh if I could just do all the things just be the body God will do the works yield ain't that right so this means that the brides will have both spirit and word right and Jesus said my spirit is word and laugh now notice National Force put Israel inner Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches but everybody say but the power of God will put the people in The Bride the world forces this way the world world forces that way that God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place can you say Amen you will be there by the word and by the spirit you will manifest him by word and spirit that's your place that's your position can you say Amen he'll put the bride in her place because she will recognize her position in the word not in a church not in a Creed in the word then she's in Christ will put her in her place no National Force will do it Russia's not he not for you Russia's heating up for this world Council of churches ain't heating up for you whatever's happened in the politics and governments and that ain't for you the power of God is for you amen don't worry listen the word is God John 1 1. and the spirit is God John 4 24. you cannot have one without the other they're one all one one and the same so if a person truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God right it was that way with the prophets right they have the spirit of God in them and the word of God came to them and what did it make them God they were called gods by God himself so it was the word that came to the prophet John at the river the prophet said he was both the prophet and the messenger for that day the Bible says he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb notice what the prophet says the word everybody say the word always comes to the spirit field that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost and Jesus said it was the evidence John 14 16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive and you say Amen so what is the comforter it's the spirit of Truth and it is a person not a thought not a ghost the person the comforter is the spirit of truth and the world cannot receive him ain't that right so what is the spirit of Truth in John 17 17 Jesus said Thy word is truth right so the spirit of the word will come to you the spirit of the word the spirit of Truth will come to you he's going to be your comfort all the words are comfort then you say Amen why is it because it's not mixed with anything it's pure word so the world cannot receive the Holy Ghost y'all with me the foolish virgin cannot receive the Holy Ghost because they failed to go on to the fullness of the atonement true and neither can they receive the word the world cannot receive the Holy Ghost they cannot receive the word because the word and spirit are one ain't that right notice now John 14 26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will sin in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you can you say Amen so we see the word coming because the spirit of God well I got the Holy Ghost I don't need the word you got some ghost that I ain't gonna call it holy and you say man see the word coming because the spirit of God notice Spirit of Truth John 14 18 I will not leave you comfortless now this is this is Jesus speaking right I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you the world's looking for a physical coming what they didn't know it was God in that body speaking to another body hello so Jesus is the comforter he is the spirit of Truth the word which is God yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I'm in the father you and me and I in you so now how are you going to know how are you going to know again this the Holy Spirit or the word always comes to the spirit field I want to take my time for just a moment I promise I'm Gonna Let You Go you'll probably think man what's happened to this guy every service now I'll tell you why I feel the urgency I don't know how much longer we got I just I don't know it's just in my heart anyways so how are you going to know Prophet says he who can receive the word believe the word and you say man the word comes the spirit field how are you going to know he who can receive the word believe the word someone asks what is the evidence that a person is really filled with the Holy Ghost John 14 26 when the Holy Ghost has come he will show you things to come see heal perfect it did he not do that is he's not doing that today taking the words of a prophet and perfecting it in your life he'll perfect it man-mades won't do it and he is the word so when he the Holy Ghost has come he will identify himself in you with the scripture and that is the true sign that the holy spirit is in you because it is the word now listen the prophet told us the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years but it is to be loosed in the evening time by this evening time message the Holy Spirit lose by the evening time word the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ revealed in human flesh in the evening time can you say man do you love him and that's what happened in according to Revelations 10 1. that Mighty angel came down with an open book the spirit of Truth came down with the open Word can you say amen and I say to you the spirit and word is here yes sir and Jesus had the indwelling of the Spirit dwelling in him without measure and the word came to him ain't that right acts 1 1 Jesus began to both do and teach both do and teach John 17 or 7 16 Jesus said my Doctrine is not mine but the father that sent me brother Brown said make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that's what he said say it again make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized with the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed and multitudes failed right there you say Amen being in the word we're gonna make it personal because the prophet did it being in the word for your age everybody say for my age is the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost and brother Brown said evidence has to do with receiving the word amen First Corinthians 14 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that these things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord brother Branham after reading this passage of scripture he said we see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order and you say Amen and notice what Paul said to them who claimed to have another revelation First Corinthians 14 36 what came the word of God to you out from you and came it unto you only now notice what brother Brian says after reading this the evidence excuse me the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth we don't need eight day Messengers we don't need higher Revelations it's not up to us to produce the truth the word but to receive the truth the word and to believe and Obey it I'll read it again the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth the word but to receive the truth the word and to believe and Obey it can you say Amen you love the Lord isn't he wonderful so now we know what the word is for our day and where it come from Malachi four five and six behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet Revelations 10 1-7 we know what that's all about so I'm not going to go into that but brother Brown said he the lamb took the book opened the book and tore up the seals and sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people his eternal thoughts his attributes his people they don't belong to the organization they've been hewed out by the prophet and they're called his people can you say Amen and notice the prophet that seventh angel must have been a prophet or the Mysteries wouldn't have came to him the word wouldn't have came to him he wouldn't have been able able to open up the Mysteries ain't that right and that seventh angel is the prophet of Malachi 4. because there's no other promise given to us about a prophet hello and if you notice Malachi 4 God didn't say behold I send unto you Elijah a bunch of prophets the prophet and you say Amen and what was the prophet a Divine interpreter of the word had the Divine interpretation the signs of him foretelling and for knowing that was a vindicate to the people that he was a prophet and today by God's help in another place he says this we now have the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication see so we're not looking for New Revelations we are just receiving the word that came to us if the musicians will come now I got more to say but I'll hush but the we know that we're only just to receive we're not to come up with new word new revelation we're just to receive because look at the prophecy for you in Revelations 10 8 and 9. John was told to get the book from the angel and eat it up receive it believe it amen can you say man wonderful remember Revelations 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come brother Brown said see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit for she is a word bride proving she has the spirit amen do you love him amen thank you for your patience I trust it was a blessing to you hallelujah hallelujah amen amen wants my soul was by The Binding chains of sin [Music] of the greedy man so pain [Music] set me free to worship him [Music] I'm singing every Glory house [Music] bless Ed be his holy names oh he's the greatest [Music] that's the song about everything [Music] oh like a long slam I was drifting good oh so helpless and alone [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Blessed Be His holy name [Music] he's the greatest [Music] that's the song Hallelujah let's sing it again I'm singing Glory oh is there a praise in your heart this morning Blessed Be is Holy Name Hallelujah great immense pain that's what he is to me That's the Song of the sing the first verse now [Music] now why so what's better that's my testimony of unbelief [Music] Set Me Free To Worship oh singing now Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah [Music] blessed day blessed day is home me for he's the great emancipated [Music] that's the song can we sing that second verse [Music] oh I was so drifting [Music] helpless and alone [Music] pretty fast oh my rewrote my life story Hallelujah let the bride said sing ing Glory Glory Hallelujah [Music] yes it be His holy name [Music] he is great demands of me that [Music] that's the song [Music] oh isn't He Lovely Hallelujah do we know that song his name is wonderful his name is wonderful his name is wonderful his name name is wonderful Jesus Jesus my Lord he is the mighty king he is master of everything his name is wonderful he is Jesus my Lord he's the great Shepherd he's The Rocker all ages oh mighty God is he I just want to bow down [Music] before him to loving and adore him [Music] his name is wonderful Jesus my Lord he's the great Shepherd you know him and to think he's living inside of your body he chose you for this age to pour himself into oh hallelujah hallelujah I want to bow down for him oh loving adore him for his name is wonderful he's Jesus my Lord oh isn't he wonderful he's so lovely here's this song I wished I could remember on my heart but it can't think of the title of it or whatever but let's just sing one more song and then we'll go Jesus I just want to praise you [Music] [Applause] use us I Just Want To Praise [Music] oh Jesus I just want to praise you praise you for being so good Jesus I wanna thank you oh Jesus I just want just thank you is that the way you feel this morning church oh I just want to say [Music] I just want to thank you [Music] thank you for you are so good as they just play quietly now God bless you may this presence of the Lord just abide with us today throughout the day and remember service at four o'clock just be in prayer that God would just speak to us again amen and tell you what we cherish the times that you feel his presence and what an honor it is that God would come Among Us amen let's just bow our heads now father we can't praise you enough can't thank you
