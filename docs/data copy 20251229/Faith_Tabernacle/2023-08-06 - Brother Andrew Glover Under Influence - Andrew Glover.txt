God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles while you're standing we want to look here in the word for a few moments with you tonight the Book of Matthew the sixth chapter the ninth verse

be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen Matthew the sixth chapter and in the ninth verse is actually the Lord's Prayer he said after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread now how many knows that's the word of the hour and forgive us our debtors as we forgive or forgive us our debts rather as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen in the book of First Corinthians the 15th chapter First Corinthians 15 and I want to look in the 33rd verse First Corinthians 15. you love the Lord tonight amen First Corinthians 15 and verse 33 Paul here writing he says now be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manner somebody say corrupt evil Communications corrupt good manners awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God and I speak this to your shame amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if God would give us Grace I want to speak to you here on the thought of a title tonight Under the Influence under the influence you know I believe there's Christians that we're living in a time of influence and I I believe that influence is a powerful thing I believe it's a it's a it's a it's something that we should take not lightly but we should take very heavily that influence is a very powerful thing now uh just maybe to lay a foundation here I was looking at several different definitions and meanings of influence and one definition it means the capacity to have an effect on the character the development or the behavior of someone or something thing or the effect itself influence is the power to shape so when when influence comes up on something it begins to shape it it begins to form it another definition means the process of producing modifications especially when slow or permanent Amen to exert or maintain a mental or moral power upon or over others so amen influence is something that's slow but it happens it amen maybe not overnight does it change but when influence begins to affect something over time you can see the influence of what is upon that thing changing it another definition of influence means the flowing into have power rather in the form of motive or ability so amen if there if there is an influence coming up on something it's actually a power that's flowing into it now you all know that brother random preaches several messages called influence influences then he preaches the influence of another and when he preaches that he takes it from Isaiah the sixth chapter and he shows you how that Isaiah come under the influence of Uzziah and he said when he did that he said he got his eyes off of the Lord got his eyes over on his eye and he said Uzziah become his influence and he said God actually let usiah fall Amen to prove to to Isaiah that have no other gods before me have no other influences amen your influence should be the Lord now when brother bran preaches this he said I want to take a subject this morning called influence and he said now you know as we might not want to believe this but everything that we do amen we are influencing someone else everything we do we are influencing someone else another place he said amen we need influential Christians amen that are influenced by the word of God we need influential Christians amen that are influenced by the word of God Amen called men or women for an influence Amen to the elected church for the last days that's what we need what we need amen is an influence from the elected Church in the last days he said and God give it to us they'll be there they're going to be now when you think about this influence influence actually has the power to convert something you all believe that influence has the power to change something has the power to shape something or to convert something in the Book of Luke the first chapter and the first verse the Bible said as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning amen were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order and then Luke says most excellent Theophilus now when you look at this word Theophilus his name actually means a friend of God Theophilus means a friend of God and actually who he was he was the person here amen that Luke addresses his gospel to as well as the book of Acts now he was probably an official of high rank so if flesh amen when when he began he was not a Christian he was not a he was not maybe a Believer amen but he was an official of high rank he was a gentile a man of a rank and a consideration now watch this who came under the influence of Luke or Paul at Rome amen and was converted to the Christian faith so in other words here you've got this this Theophilus who is a high-ranking a gentile amen and everybody's looking at him everybody's talking to him amen but then he comes in contact with two holy ghost-filled men we'll say it like that amen Luke and and and uh Luke and Paul amen and then he's converted to the Christian faith now I want to say it to you like this what happened to Theophilus amen was he came in contact with influential Christians amen he came in contact with Believers Amen in other words he came in contact with salt right now in the Book of Matthew the fifth chapter the 13th verse amen the Bible says that ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior it man we're with shall it be salted it is henceforth good for nothing amen but to be cast down or cast out and to be trodden under the foot of man so when when influence happens or rather when salt amen loses its savior amen it is to be cast out and trodden under the foot of man can you say Amen now that word salt actually is a symbol amen of a lasting Concord because it protects food amen from putrification and it preserves it unchanged so when salt comes into something it has the ability Amen to preserve something and to keep it from changing now you know the prophet taught us that we must be salty amen and if we're salty then the world will be thirsty right amen if the salt in our life be it full of Savior amen then it will create a thirst in the world probably God said you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has only got a look and not a savior amen it's henceforth good for nothing but to be laughed at so it's it's not good enough just to look like salt it's not good enough just to act like salt amen but there's got to be some Savor in that salt again the prophet said you know Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God he said the Bible said that we are the salt of the earth and if the salt is still God its savior in it amen in contacts it's a savior amen so if salt still has its Savory and it contacts something then whatever it contacts it will have an influence upon what it contacts see if the Saul has lost its string he said if our testimonies are irregular and one they were up and the next they were down and this they were believing and the next day we're not we how can a sinner how can a sinner amen find anything from us see amen we must take our stand for God and there remain there until death sets us free and when you start looking at this salt amen there's got to be a strength in the salt amen and the strength that's in the salt brother says is the power of the Resurrection in the Christian he said see the strength of the holy spirit amen should be in every member of the church how many will agree that the strings amen of the Holy Spirit should be in every member of the church see what do you mean strength he says the power of the Resurrection he said the life that Jesus gave for the church should be operating Amen in every member of the body the life of Jesus Christ amen should be operating in every member of the body he said now salt will only save it if it contacts amen but it must contact and if the church gets that burden on their heart Amen to contact someone Amen to get someone saved he said then the strings amen is coming back into the church again amen into the people so amen we're not looking for the strengths that come into the carpet or to the sheetrock or to the amen to the peace but we're looking for the strength of the Holy Spirit which is the power of the Resurrection Amen to come into every member and make them more than a church member amen but makes him an influential Christian Amen in that in the last day now amen I said like this our influence changes the world Amen not the world changed in our influence amen the world should the world should not change the influence of the Church Father God said you're the saw the Earth he said I'm afraid I'm afraid that's what happened to the church it's just lost his sweetness it's lost it's love amen it's lost its influence to bring Sinners to you Lord he said just taking in a bunch of members and baptized them amen and let them live in the world Amen and their influence has corrupted the church amen so when a sinner comes in that's what the proud of God said I do not believe a man gets saved tonight and preach the gospel tomorrow he said I don't believe you get saved tonight or on the bar room last night playing music and get saved and start playing music in church now I know that may be controversial but let me just preach the message amen the prophet believed in a transformation amen or a conversion that would take every ounce of the world Amen out of the individual because if that ounce of world comes in the church amen it don't take two pounds it don't take amen two gallons to change it just takes one ounce of the world coming in the church and that one ounce can corrupt the church amen but I say oh God let the power of the Holy Ghost amen come back in the church to when a sinner gets saved amen they don't change church books they don't change Church cards they but they changed from the inside out Amen in all the world dies and all the birth of Jesus Christ and his power comes into the individual now I'll just say it like I believe that worldly influence don't belong in the church amen amen the influence of the world does not belong in the church amen now the prophet said like this he said that's the main thing is being influenced see not by what great numbers we are but by what a great God that we're representing amen and that kind of life that's in US is by him see that will influence others so can I say it this way we are influenced and we influence others are you with me we are influenced but we also influence others and the way we influence others is by what we ourselves have been influenced by amen he said now we are the salt amen but if the salt loses its strength amen its power to contact amen salt can only save as it contacts and if it loses its power of contact then it's no more salt amen but it's sand so when Saul loses its savior amen when salt loses its contact it's no longer salt it becomes sand he said and when we lose our influence as a father as a mother as a Christian as a businessman as a to minister when we lose our influence with the people now we can be very popular in the line of the world Amen but I mean we represent Christ amen and when we lose our influence he said then how can we blend in with the day amen when God is so against the day do you realize that this is the evil day amen that Paul speaks 7 Ephesians the sixth chapter amen that they'll they'll come an evil day amen and we're living in that day so a Christian cannot blend in with this day amen but a Christian has got to stand out in this state listen you were not born to fit in amen you were born to stand out amen you say why was I born to stand out because you amen are God's point of contact on the earth the prophet said oh may we and we must press with all that's in us do everything we can he said be sure that we speak to every sinner during the time of this convention approach every businessman and every unsaved person and those without Christ amen without the Holy Spirit now I love how he says he said we want to approach them with the message amen so brother Rana was not one that believes you got people to Christ and then you got him to the message amen he actually believed the message was Christ amen so when you approach somebody amen you approach him to the channel of the message with the same solid gospel to approach the people he said let our lives be so salty that others can watch the way we Act and the way we live and they'll want to live that way too see amen because if the salt lost its testimony its savior amen is trolling power then it can no more heal or save amen sought contacts and we must be God's contact amen we are his point of contact on the earth that's why Jesus prayed in the model prayer amen Lord he said let thy will be done let thy kingdom come and let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven see in other words you are the salt of the earth I've got a good friend down in Florida brother Wesco one of his favorite quotes is said you're taking Jesus place on the earth amen I'll set you like this amen he was the salt of the earth when he was here amen he was the light of the world when he was here amen but he's not here to day in a corporate body amen but you are here amen which is making you his amen making you take his place amen here on the earth now when I say it like this let me say it this way amen that this message of the hour has come into this age Amen to be put on display or to be exhibited in flesh Amen brother bam speaks of it in in 1964 Amen in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride is talking about how he goes through town and he's visiting the hotels and he's visiting the restaurants and he goes through there and one of the one of the owners says to him I said I want to comment to you amen as I was going to different places well the owners said stream said sir that's one of the finest bunch of people I've ever seen he said they're really nice so I went to a motel yesterday amen and I had to had to meet a father and a mother and their daughter and I had to go to manager to find the room they were in and he said are you brother Brandon that's up at the Oaks I said yes sir he said I want to shake your hand he introduced me to his wife very nice couple he said every person in this Motel is attending services said we reserved it for them all the other customers we turned down I said well thank you for that he said brother Branham one of the nicest bunch of people I ever seen amen are the people that comes up here and that attends your meeting see amen I love what he says he says so to be that Amen to me you are the salt of the earth amen so when a prophet was preaching the word amen the salt of God was back in human flesh amen and it was contacting Sinners Amen to the preacher the message in their flesh was making an influence upon the business owners of the town he said I'm so grateful to know I have the privilege of preaching to people that even sinners now I don't say these people are sinners but I mean the business and so forth amen can say you're nice people and they appreciate you in their business around their places you know that's being salty amen I appreciate your behavior amen the way that you take care of things he said I feel you're my children you are the stars and if I ever have one when I get there you'll be that true you amen out shining part in the crown of my Ministry amen when it's crowned you will be that Jewel amen when when the ministry of William random is crowned amen you will be the jewels in the ministry of the Prophet now come on Church Amen brother Branham never went in there and preached the future home he never went in there and preached the invisible union he never went in there and preached things that are to be they never heard sermons amen but the people who was hearing them sermons was under the influence and they were being shaped Amen to live a life it was according to the word that they was hearing I don't know about you but I say oh God Amen shape Our Lives amen that when people see us and they hear us and they meet us amen that their life can be contacted by the message of the hour because we are the salt of the earth now when you start looking at this influence you'll realize amen that influence comes from somewhere right amen influence comes from somewhere which tells me amen that influence has a source now the prophet says here as I've often said I believe in the church here there's a role here amen that like that we're mortal beings live and each one in this great conglomeration I get it out in a minute of gaiety Amen of Blackness and darkness Mortals live in here he said now they are either influenced from this away or from that away when he says this he said you cannot be here amen a spiritual being a sinner or Saint amen without having an influence from the underworld or the above world so brother Terry there's two worlds there's an underworld and then there is an above world and the prophet of God said if you're a sinner you've got a spirit influencing you and if you're a saint you've got a spirit influencing you he said if you're influenced from here amen then from above see amen your Celestial body is waiting up here but if you're Wicked and hypocritical and indifferent then your Celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think it's up there because the fruits you bear amen before the people proves where you're from so you are here what you are somewhere else that's why the prophet said amen that death does not change a person it only changes their Dwelling Place if you was indifferent here death is not going to make you calm amen meant if he was evil here death is not going to make you righteous as a tree falls amen so shall she lay listen friends the prophet said your life you live here is reflecting what your inheritance is when you leave here another place he said the whole Heir has become contaminated with the powers of the underworld amen the powers of Darkness another place he said the sinner is influenced by a spirit amen because he has a spirit and the wrong gives influence and the right gives influence and those who are dominated with Blackness and separation amen are dominated from the underworld of devils now how many will agree we're living in the time when the lead has been taken off of Hell probably God said the letters come off of hell and demon powers are streaming throughout the world do you realize what they're contacting amen they're contacting their subjects amen which has an inheritance reserved in darkness and and fire amen and so what they're doing is their manifest investing as a billboard amen the underworld listen friends I do not believe amen that the devil is the only person that's got a billboard in this world I believe that Jesus Christ has got a bride in this age who is not influenced from the underworld but she's influenced from the above world and she's manifesting the life of God on this Earth amen somebody asked me one time they said how can you prove amen how can you prove that the underworld is influenced in this world that we're in I said well it's very easy souls in prison 1963. there I was outside of JCP enny he said there I was outside of JCPenney he said in front of there and he said there come a woman had that blue stuff under eyes he said when I looked at her I thought I'm a missionary I prayed for people around the world he said I was going to pray for remember that you know what he said he said it was demon powers manifesting in this realm and now watch you say how do you know that because when he went to when he went uh to the region to the Lost what did he say he said there I saw those blue eyes and all that makeup and stuff and his was his words he said there I was back in hell again when he saw it in JCPenney amen where did it come from it came from the underworld and that Spirit of influence had influenced girls listen they're literally being influenced from the pits of Hell amen I'll say this friends it's time to change our influence amen it's time to let the word of God Amen be our influence amen we are influenced by the environment that we live in amen like you you take for an example a desert amen a desert in the Bible or rather a desert today amen a desert known to be dry it's known to be hot it's known to be sticky it's known to not have any moisture amen and if a person lives I remember I remember first time I ever went to Arizona I hey man I was out there for about a week and about two days into it brother Kevin hey man I just bounce through the I said I couldn't even hardly spit I mean I wasn't sweating now my hands was I mean it was horrible and I'm thinking oh dear lord what's going on and come to find out I wasn't drinking enough water and the in the environment I was in was influencing my body probably God said the environment you live in amen influences you he said he's a Christian speaking of a man that was called to preach he said it's a little boy he said when he become a Christian he got in the wrong environment and that environment influenced him amen now watch he said and you just keep holding around with that kind of environment and it'll influence you see amen the first thing you know you become a part of the environment amen you go into it and just like a good clean man that's clean and moral and he begins to associate with a bunch of people who's not amen see you take up the spirit of that because everything is governed by a spirit y'all remember talked about Nellie Sanders he said she was delivered from dancing he said but she went up there and he said she thought she could stand there and he said before she knew it she found herself back on the Dance Floor amen what happened the environment pulled her into it amen she had been delivered of it but the environment influenced her and her body followed the influence listen I think it's time to discern the spirit amen that's motivating the atmosphere that we're dwelling in we we are under a commission of God to discern the spirit to withstand the spirit amen and to live under the influence of the above world and not the underneath world Amen you say why do why is it so important is for me as a Christian Amen to live amen because God is going to have a point of contact in laodicea he's going to have somebody he can contact I got to thinking about this brother shamaya and I heard the story brother M Tales he was in a restaurant in Toledo Ohio y'all remember the story and he said there I was and there was a police officer and a young woman he said and they said the young woman and the police officer sitting there he said the police officer had his hands in places they should have never been he said while I'm sitting there he said there was an old woman comes out he said she's dressed like a uh like I don't know what he said pain on her face all kinds of things he said she was immorally dressed he said and I started condemning her he said but then all of a sudden he said the angel showed him Jesus on the cross remember he said the angel showed him Jesus it's on the cross and he said when I saw him he said I began to look there and I seen him crawl amen I seen the old book laying there as a sinner there laid everything on it and I've seen my sins what I was doing and I said Lord will you forgive me and he took his hand in his side and got some blood out and he rode across the top and said pardon then he threw it back in the sea of forgetfulness to remember it no more it was gone forever he said now I forgive you but you're condemning her see he said now that changed my idea I said Lord have mercy after I come out of it I walked over and I sat down I said how do you do ma'am she said oh hello I said if you'll pardon me I'm Reverend random a minister she said oh excuse me excuse me go to the story I said I will stand there and I was condemning you and thinking what a horrible thing maybe you've got children she said I have I said what caused the way to go wrong she said begin to unfold the story amen would Rend any heart she said I was asking her he said I was asking God Amen didn't he just rake such off the Earth hear you here with two drunken men you're drunk yourself I said someday the blood that's holding God's Wrath from you is going to you're going to die one of these days you're a premarital agent now you can reject or receive and I said but someday your Soul's going to be on there see amen now watch where there's no mercy left if you die in your sins you're already judged amen you're going to hell you know that the woman slipped out of the seat there in the restaurant and we had a prayer meeting like you've never heard in your life and she come to Christ he said he said don't condemn them the gospel that's real I from over here amen but our influence comes from above what did I tell that because here's a prophet in a restaurant condemning a lady amen but God has got him on the earth to be salt amen and there he is in that restaurant and God gets a hold of him and through him he contacts that woman and that woman gives her heart to God and serves him the rest of her days listen friends I think it's time to make sure that our influence is in the right place so that God can use us anywhere Anytime Anyplace that he desires to see fit to use us I don't know about you but I want to be a place of contact I want to be a place of contact that God can use me to contact somebody else and to lead them from the past of sin into the paths of righteousness I love what Paul said he said set your affection on things above amen and not on things on the earth now now we've already said it I'll say it again just this way the believer's influence is the word right the believer's infamous just the word probably God said let's not let nothing influence us but the word of God let that be our influence now whatever is influencing you amen it has the preeminence of you in other words it has consumed you whatever is influence in you has the preeminence of you it has consumed you that's why we cannot let an ounce of the world come in the church it will corrupt and consume the church Paul said he is the body the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead amen that in all things he might have the preeminence that word preeminence means to be first or to hold the first place so brother bam says here he said I'm looking for a Time To Break Forth of the spirit of God in these last days where we're now living amen see for a Rapture and Faith just before it comes and I believe that we're now at the time that the word should have the preeminence I believe the time to lay aside our Creeds and our faults and come back to the word so what's he saying here he's saying the time has come for the revelation of the word which is the head and to take preeminence in the body which is a many membered body so that is why the Christians are the body of God they are the source of influence of God upon the Earth Paul said ye are our epistle written in our hearts known in the red of all men for as much as ye are manifested declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God see not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart now can I can I read this to you the part of God said we never know just what we're doing what influence we're doing is having upon others that is your life reached so loud to the public until your testimony if it's contrary to your life is without any effect see that's what's it's what's on the inside of you that the people read not so much what you say but what you are seeing you can pin something on somebody say this is that and so forth but your life being different from what they say your testimony of your life is louder than the testimony that someone could say something about you yeah so just keep that on mind that we're bringing influences every day right and the life that you live proves what's on the inside of you amen the life that you're living is proving what's on the inside of you you cannot change that amen it reflects every person reflects outside what he is inside amen listen when he takes the name on of Jesus Christ he is going to be a representative Christ then you should watch every move you make because somebody is watching you I like to say it like this it's the Holy Ghost on the inside ain't been working on the outside oh what a change has come into our life amen amen it's Jesus on the inside amen working on the outside oh what a change in our life amen I said like this that's why amen that the holy spirit is a definite must in this day Paul said amen or Jesus rather said receive the promise of the father in The Book of Acts he said you shall receive power Paul says in Ephesians 5 amen be filled with the spirit probably God said that's the reason the holy spirit is a definite must in this day because it's the one that lives your life you don't live it yourself it's Christ in you that after you receive the Holy Spirit if he don't have the preeminence in your life then you just remember you haven't received the Holy Spirit because if he's in you he will live his life life on can I just give you a few statements here Amen on the Holy Spirit influence amen maybe you can remember these amen the holy spirit is the influence amen that feels and governs the soul the holy spirit is the influence that feels and governs the soul amen the holy spirit is the efficient source of any power affection emotion or desire amen God puts the desire there he has a motive and put an affair and he has the ability to produce amen the desire that he put there and you know friends this evening Amen to if we're under the influence of something amen the best sign amen is to be in direct contact with what we're under the influence of y'all y'all remember the amen I hope I'm not born yet amen y'all remember the young boy walked in the bar room that day remember said he walked in there and he said when he went in there he looked and he saw the bartender and he said sir your signs down he said okay I'll go out there thinking goes out there looks up his signs still hanging on the building takes his apron cleans it off comes back in tells the boy uh Sonny you're wrong said my sign's not down said it's right there he said no your best sign brother Sammy said your best sign he said that's the best sign I got he said no he said the man that just walked out of here is laying down there in the gutter passed out he said that's your best sign see what it was he was under the influence of what was being sold on the inside and the prophet of God said when we see a man under the influence of the Holy Spirit until his life is burning with the old-fashioned Pentecostal fire amen that's the best sign that God ever had that a man is saved is when he'll serve it's the best sign amen the best sign that God's got a hold of your life is not you can quote scripture not that you can quote the quotes but when you will become a channel that God can use on the earth to contact others amen that is the best sign that you're under amen and influence now I'll set like this I believe the message of our is our influence I believe that influences are singing influences are preaching influences her dress influences our activities come on church amen the message of the hour is our influence which that means the message of the hour is the light first John 1 5 we spoke come this morning latter part of that scripture it says God is light and then him is no Darkness at all amen the reason I say this to the church Living God today Shalom is because we are his lights amen see ye are the light of the world now the world is under the influence of Darkness right amen but the Church of the Living God is under the influence of light amen the Bible says in John 12 35 yet a little while it's a lot with you walk while you have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth while you have the light amen believing the light that you may be the children of light amen these things spake Jesus and departed and did hit himself from them in Ephesians 5 8 Paul says ye were sometimes Darkness amen but now are you alive in the Lord so walk as the children of light in first Thessalonians 5 5 hear all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness you say then one are the children of Life the prophet of God said we are to be those children and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know that light except it comes from the word so the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it now how many knows in Matthew 2 that there were three wise men right and those three wise men were following a star Amen to come to the birth of the Lord Jesus the Bible says when Jesus was born Amen in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the east of Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jew for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him verse said the wise man of the old followed the god-given substance they followed the word of God to the light because it was the word that brought life amen and so will the wise man today he says who is not blinded by Creeds will follow the god-given spoken word till they see the fullness of the power of God blooming forth in this hour they see it and they know it's here in the scripture amen because God promised it for this day so we are under the influence of the pillar of fire now amen I love this because the product God said I believe amen that the message of the hour amen is what will fool around the second coming of Christ somebody somebody told me one time they sit now uh there are certain things in the message it's not really scriptural you can't prove it by scripture so you know me I just ask him well well give me one you know and they said well I count their 1933 the Ohio River a light come down that's not scriptural I said well it's not scriptural to you but it actually is scriptural they said well give me a scripture well look in Deuteronomy 4 36 Out of Heaven he made you hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon the Earth he showed thee his great fire and thou heardst his words out of the midst of the fire amen I don't know what more but Terry describes what happened on the Ohio River than that verse right there when the prophet said Out of Heaven came alive which was identified as the pillar of fire amen and how about Pillar of Fire there were some words spoken and here were the words as John the Baptist was sent to Forum the first coming of Christ amen your message will forerun the second coming of Christ he said that's what the angel of the Lord said amen now the message he said and I believe that I have the message of the day that is the light of the day is pointing to the time coming amen I believe the message he said down there is the message that you have listen amen if you won't argue with it if you won't tamper with it if you won't question it if you'll receive it and believe it that message will become a token to you it'll become a provision for you it'll become a signal it'll become a sign it'll become an end sign it'll become a protection for you and you'll stay under that message it'll influence your destination you say influence my destination well what about Rahab the Harlot Joshua's second chapter amen you can read about it but in Hebrews 11 31 Paul says amen by faith the Harlot Rahab perish not with him that believe not not when she had received the spies with peace amen the protagon said Rahab was a believer in Gentile he said believe in Gentile Harlot a and he was a Believer he's he had heard the wrath of God they had heard of the display and signs the Miracles of God among his people but they had to receive it see she had to receive God's destroy an angel was coming they knew it and Joshua was the angel they were in line he said that little old Harlot had heard amen and all the country was disturbed about Joshua he said now watch Rahab honor those spies and how did she honor them she said I want to live everything was in the line of Destruction but Rahab confessed I want to live amen and Jericho heard what God was doing he said the same as denomination but makes a warning see amen and we're living in the age the same time when God has manifesting himself and they refuse to take God's provided way of Escape he said now what happened they were all shut up see but there must have been some tape boys that slipped in somewhere for the predestinated seed they slipped over to her house and played some tapes now watch she made her own house a church she made her house a church to receive the message listen friends the message was spoken that day on the river amen but when it's spoken it's got to be received and Rahab prepared her home to receive a message of Deliverance in a time of Destruction listen I believe Church Living God Amen that we're on the verge of Destruction amen and when destruction set in rahab's house was not touched but remember said why because God himself recognized his messenger's message Oh Glory to God he said God himself recognized his messenger's message he said then what happens see they could read the scriptures while the battle was going on while the war was going on they were not looking out for Windows that they were not seeing what was happening they were in their house reading the scriptures and feeding on the message because they were under the influence of a message that said you will not be destroyed amen but you will leave here your family will leave here everything under the token will be spared oh come on sir you might as well wake up have churches Sunday night amen and here we are in the last days and the world has fallen apart but there's a bride who is under the influence of a message from the above world and she's feeding on things listen Russia's hollering the bomb is built California is going under nations are breaking Israel's Awakening she's in her Homeland but there's a bride on the earth tonight who has come under the influence of a token from the above world and when destruction sets in she will not be a part of it she will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye the old will become young mortal will become immortal corruption will put on incorruption and death will be swallow up in Victory listen friends let me say this as plain as I know how them tapes are not for token them tapes are not the token but the token is on the tapes [Music] so if you come under the influence of the tapes you will come under the influence of the word that's being preached the token listen I know there should be a question right now amen there was a question for Rahab there was a question for the for the firstborn son in Israel there's always a question when it gets closer sister Becky to the time of fulfillment there's a question sits in is this message right is God still with this message let me say without any reservation tonight hear my voice that God is still with the message can I get a witness that believes that God is still with the message are you hearing me God is still with the message I know we got to a Time amen where everybody's got to see an angel feel an angel bump into an angel and I believe in those things but don't you forget the fact that a prophet said amen the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always amen wherever the message of the hour is being preached brother Matthew the angel of the Lord is there somebody said well I didn't see him that don't mean he's not here amen if you're preaching the message he's here because he cannot go on anywhere without the message and the message cannot be anywhere without him because he and the message are one listen friends if this message is in your home the angel of God is there if this message is in your car the angel of God is there if this message is on your job the angel of the Lord is there wherever this message is preached amen the angel of the Lord accompanies the message well I feel like shouting on that one amen the angel Lord is not in the Tomb in Jerusalem he's not in a grave in Jeffersonville he's not in the mountains of Tucson he's not buried at sunset Mountain but the same Angel that's in that picture is whirling through this building right now by the preaching of the message of the hour what are you saying I'm saying if we'll preach this message it'll bring an influence from heaven in the church and it'll silence evil communication and it will awake a righteousness in the church Living God as the devil cannot put out with all of his demons and all of his hymns they will never stop the influence of this word somebody shot Glory hallelujah amen he's with his message won't we give him a hand clap of praise the angel of the Lord is with the message and if the angel brother Kevin of the Lord is with the message he's with you just your hope is with you Amen brother will he's with you amen wherever you go the angel of the Lord is with you Sister Lisa he's with you Amen brother Branson he's with you sister rayanna he's with you he's always with you he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you I'll be with you always even till the end and here we are at the end and there's many walking away but hang on little bride there's a fool there's a full influence of the body changing power coming in this age what are you saying I'm seeing God's always with this message he was with it when the prophet was preaching it and he was with it when the church was listening to it in their homes now you may prove it to you Jamaica he said they got a little six volt battery recorder took it down there in the Jamaica land so they were listening to tapes on them Seven Seals He said Out of Heaven oh God I love how you always identifies It Out of Heaven he said a lot come in the room I'm on Church help me a little bit a light come in the room he said when the light come in there he said it went over there and hung over the tape recorder no offense it didn't hang over Billy Graham's books no offense it didn't hang over oral Robert's videos no offense it didn't follow Dr Dobson it didn't back up smiley face in Texas it didn't accompany TD Jake's but this message has come from the angel itself so the angel has to identify that he's with it he said and it's the same one that was in the picture hung over the tape recorder what are you saying preacher I'm saying have we forgot where the change comes in a service have we forgot amen where when the atmosphere gets right and the Holy Ghost starts moving and you start feeling something changing have we forgot where it comes from it don't come from the preacher it don't come from the gifted preacher it don't come from a man it comes from the influence of the Angel that's in the building you say there's an influence right here on a Sunday night about the hour don't know what time it is amen about 606 on a Sunday night even in the angels of God are in this building can I can I get two or three witnesses that believe that the angels of God is in this building I love what the Bible says this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles for the angel of the Lord a camp in campus about them that fear him and delivereth him oh taste and see that the Lord is good and blessed is the man that trusteth in him are you ready for this God is always present the angels of the Lord are copy about those who fear Him are you ready for this he says in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ in this building tonight brother Judah he says is a host of angels He says thousands of them gathered around you don't see them you don't see them but you feel the influence of them amen telling you they're here you don't see the Angels amen you don't describe them amen you come on church with her here and you feel the influence of them then what are those angels doing as you're hearing the word those angels are bringing a power into you and that power is shaping you it's shaping your confession it's shaping your testimony it's shaping your body old church and living God I say let the angel do the preaching again if the angel do the influence again if we'll just give room for the angel of God he'll change a negative confession to a positive he'll change an empty heart to a field because he still has the power to influence human beings by his presence in a meeting yes sir some of y'all sitting there and you're saying with Andrew I don't feel like crazy in my hand and you're doing it anyhow you're sitting there right now and your body's saying go to sleep and you're fighting to stay awake you know what's happening amen there's an angel hanging over you I said oh God hallelujah there's an angel hanging right on you say preacher you're getting far out there I do not believe in the worship of angels but I do believe in the ministry of angels and I believe there's Angels right here in this bill come on there was an angel that met Elie Easter and led him to Rebecca and the problem of God said you know why Rebecca believed he said because when she heard Ellie Easter's message he said there was an angel hanging over her that persuaded her to believe what she was hearing was the truth did you know how that Hattie ride got her two boys back it's because the same angel that was on the river that was in the cave that was in the woods was in the house of the rights and when she began to hear the word she began to say that's nothing but for truth and an angel influenced her to believe real Church Living God if an angel could be influence Hattie if an angel can influence Rebecca then I believe an angel can influence will I believe an angel can influence Tim I believe an angel can influence Shema because we're not a different believer we are the same Believers in the same word and it will just let the angel influence us God have mercy somebody shout hallelujah there's an Angelic influence and it's in the building see what is it it's a supernatural influence it's a super it's something beyond your ability it's something beyond your understanding you do not see it you maybe can't touch it but you know it's here you know why you know it's here because there's something in you connecting with something in it bearing record he is here see he's here what are you saying preacher I'm saying if he's here then he's here to free his church if he's here sister Jane he's here to free his church can I say this with all my heart amen I'm just gonna I'm gonna preach that devil back to Hillary come from God is fear to free his church by his word you agree with me God is here to free his word free his church amen by his word amen I love this quote he says Satan has no more power somebody shout amen only as he can buff with it if he can Bluff you into it all right you'll have to have it but legally he has no power at all every Power he had was taken from him at Calvary that's where the price was paid he's nothing but a bluff he is nothing but a bluff he is nothing but a preacher are you crazy no the devil is nothing but a bluff he said if you want to listen to his blood full all right are you ready for this but you don't have to if you want to listen to Satan's Bluff go right ahead but you don't have to amen believe that because you are free tonight he has made you free brother Andrew I don't know what to believe believe the Angel that's influencing you right now to believe Satan is a bluff every Power was robbed on him a cow right he's legally trespassing on God's Property you gotta rot tonight by the power of the Holy Ghost to believe the Devil is a defeated being and he's on his way back to hell but you're on your way back to God because you came from God and you got to go back to God Amen you didn't come from hell so you can't go back to hell you didn't come from Hades so you can't go back you got to go back where you come from and there's nothing the devil can do Amen to tie you to this Earth when the word has been revealed you are free you're free to worship you're free to believe you're free to shout you're free to dance you're free to believe the word of God because the angel of the Lord has influenced your heart to believe this is not just freedom for the will it's Supreme freedom that's a direct quote it's Supreme freedom from the word what are you saying I'm saying this if something in the word can make you realize can I can I preach this quote if something in the word can make you realize you are free by his grace or if something realized and the word makes you understand or some Act of God that it included you it includes us all then you just accepted on those bases you're free you're free you don't have to feel any different you don't have to feel anything at all you're free oh God when you hear the word you're free when you hear the promise that Satan is a bluff every disease is defeated every sickness is healed when you hear that word come on Church you got a right to act upon the word that you heard what amen I'm gonna preach on in a few days amen what are you saying preacher I'm saying amen the miracle takes place on the word direct quote the miracle takes place on the word so when you hear the word you recognize the word and you act upon the word I've often wondered brother Bill when a brother and preach if God be with us then we'll be all his miracles I've always wondered why the prophet took time to say it's time to go into action but then I heard another day he said the action is to act upon his word in other words you know God in other words you hear his word and you act upon his word like this amen we singed all night we fished all night and every time we let down our net we pulled it back up empty every time we let it down we pulled it back up empty so what did Jesus say he said at that word he said lay down the net again are you hearing me amen the action was oh God the action was the word amen and they let down the net was the action and the Miracle took place on the word when they pulled the net back up it like they broke the oars amen because the net was full of fears are you hearing me church when we prove it let me give you another example amen the woman with just a little bit of oil and a little bit of meal in a barrel amen the Act was give it all to a prophet amen and the Word was this day the meal will never run empty and the oil will never run by or you hearing me the miracle takes place on the word well that same word is in this building tonight and if I can present it to you in such a way by the word and you can see that you're free you can realize you're free he said you don't have to feel anything at all different he said no sir if you believe it then take the two-edged sword and cut every Promise free because God is going to have somebody that's going to believe every promise of God's word regardless of how they feel oh I remember I remember one time y'all heard the quote remember so when you got the purchase and power he said you don't have to wait till you get the bread he said you can go ahead and dance a little jig that's actually a direct quote he said you can go and you can dance a little jig when you hear you got the purchase in power there was a brother down in Tennessee one day he heard that quote had leukemia in his body eating up his body he was down with leukemia he heard that quote across the pulpit you know what he did I've never seen that man dancing all my life I never seen him move but brother Sean he jumped out and he started dancing and shouting um I'm just going to say this amen I don't know what happened to spontaneous praise but I think it needs to come back well glory to God you say what are you getting at I'm saying God ain't looking for your fancy footwork he ain't looking for how well you can dance or some other day they said oh I would dance if I had some good footwork I thought dear God have we gone back to Pentecostalism or we got to practice our shout and get all of our footwork amen I want to say this God wants to see somebody praise him he don't care if he got pretty footwork or ugly footwork he just wants somebody who will act upon the word of God and that man began to shout and dance and he went to the doctor the next day and the leukemia was completely gone out of his body listen he didn't have a report he didn't have a CT scan he didn't have a blood test but he had the word and he believed the word and he received the word and the Miracle took place on the word what are you saying I'm saying amen that this body is flesh and it's under the influence of death but there is a soul in there that is under the influence of a theophany which is an eternal life and outside of that we have no hope outside of that we have no hope but if a breath of fresh air somebody say fresh air we'll come into our hearts amen by that baptism of the Holy Ghost we'll hear from our theophany right Paul to gosh when you heard the word for your age it was Eagle food he said you left the other thing you heard from your theophany amen I'm gonna set you like this amen we right here tonight and I'm going to close you on this we're right here tonight have come back under prophetic utterance we are back under prophetic utterance but let me say it like this we're not back under prophetic utterance of uh I feel I think I sense I feel I see uh somebody in here no we're under Vindicated prophetic utterance we're under word prophetic utterance listen here in the Book of Ezekiel 37 and verse 1. amen the hand of the Lord was upon me and he carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry I preached that church before Lo they were very dry a bunch of dry bones you know amen and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered O Lord God thou knowest and again he said unto me feel upon these bones sense upon these bones oh I think he said prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh you dry bones hear the word of the Lord what was the action the action was prophesied and the Miracle took place on the word of the Lord can I can I tell you what this word prophesy means it's under the influence of a Divine spirit so in other words what the spirit is telling him is you bring them dry bones under the influence of a Divine Spirit let's set the Lord God in these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live I will they send you upon you I will bring flesh upon you I will cover you with skin put them breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a quiet little bit of a little bit of noise that you could hear there was a noise and beholders shaken and the bones come together bone to his bone amen and when I beheld low sin you and flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them Church there was no breath right there is three stages of a restoration there was in you there was flesh amen are you hearing me amen but there was bone back to Bone amen but there was no life there was no breath in them then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the Four Winds old breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live so I prophesied old church I could preach here for a minute we've come through justification through sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen before was not enough in that Pentecostal age to put the life of God back in these dry bones but in the end time the bride will come out of a Pentecostal age into a bright age by the voice of the seventh angel she will come under prophetic utterance she will come into the influence of a Divine spirit and it will put her in position to receive rapturing Faith oh I prophesied as he commanded and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet amen and exceeding great Army then he said unto me son of man can these uh these bones of the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried our hope is lost we are cut off of our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God behold all my people I will open your Graves that's a shouting point right there and cause you to come up out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves o my people and brought you up out of your Graves and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and I shall place you in your own land and you shall know that I the Lord has spoken it and performed it saith the Lord Prophet God said what happened there he said life come back in that fourth message he said what was the fourth message it was the fourth light he said which was the word itself the word made flesh the fruits the proof of the Resurrection inside that Christ has finally somebody say finally finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ again has centered himself like the cap of the pyramid he has centered himself for the Terry like the cap of the pyramid amen first line justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost the incoming of the cap amen can I say this to you church because I feel I feel I feel the clothes right here on this point amen I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath somebody say the breath the breath came into them and they lived and stood up on their feet and exceeding great Army Amen brother brother Kevin what brought him back for sin you know the flesh no amen the muscle know what brought him back was when the breath come in them when the breath come in them they come back to life do you realize where that breath come from that was the same breath that sustained Jonah in the well the proud of God said there he is and somehow oxygen came into that well he just breathed normally for three days he said he got all freshened up with some new oxygen Out of Heaven it couldn't come out of a whale it couldn't come out of the sea so it had to come from God and let me say this Faith Tabernacle this is my prayer over this church tonight oh breathe on us tonight Lord that's the oxygen of the word of God in the power of his resurrection that we can stay alive in this last Wicked day breathe Upon Us O Holy Spirit how many can raise your hands and say oh God breathe upon me Lord breathe up homie Lord amen the wind is that wind is being taken out of us people's losing their desire they're losing their Joy but you have come under an influence of the above World in a wicked and adulterous generation I say oh God send the Heavenly oxygen in this building tonight and breathe on our young people breathe on our musicians breathe on our preachers breathe on our pastor breathe on our young people breathe on this church oh God breathe into US Lord breathe into us bring us unto that Divine influence of spirit receive ye the Holy Ghost and what did he do he breathed upon him what is amberlander I'm saying you got to have breath you know why because you got to prophesy again you cannot survive without oxygen in laodicea you got to have it [Music] and revelation 10 8 says You must prophesy again what do you say brother Andrew I'm saying it's time it's time to make preparation for the fulfilling it has been spoken it has been written and if you'll come to the influence of it it'll shape your life into a body change how many believes God still in the miracle working business where's that breath come into comes into your lungs feel that feel that breath coming in there if there's no lungs breath cannot come into them there's no lungs breath cannot come into them but if there's lungs there oxygen wind breath will come into them and they'll breathe again and they'll live again this this week I want to share this with you and I'm closing just this week down at brother Joe's camp meeting there on Wednesday morning I went to the service there and some of you may have heard of brother and sister brother brother uh George charnick his wife uh last year two years I believe was passed passed away in a car wreck this is his first year coming back to the States I think

there he said I come back home he said I come here for the meet and said I was wore out in my body just just totally depleted he said but I just attributed it to the fact that I've been gone come here preach gone back home he said when I got home he said well in two days I was in the hospital and he said I'd contacted a germ in the Amazon that was literally destroying every organ in my body he said when I got there they looked at me realized what it was he said they put me in a room of isolation he said in the isolation room they shut the door and he said they began to contact the doctors in the Amazon to try to figure out what in the world I'd contacted because they had no ability to trace it to cure it to fight it they didn't know what it was and he actually sent me a picture if you want to see it I'll show it to you after church of the MRI when they took a picture of his lungs then they took this picture brother you can literally see his lungs are gone I mean they're just they're just eating up they're deteriorated they're just literally gone by this infection he's on a respirator oxygen all these things and he said while I'm laying there he said my family goes to prayer my daughter goes to prayer he said my wife is praying he said and all of a sudden Sister Crystal he said in that room come a presence of God he said when they come in there he said I said oh God I need a new set of lungs he's Lord I Need in the lungs but MRI says they're gone he said they're they're they're they're they're they're they're deteriorating they're leaving my body he said oh God which you created me a new set of lungs he said about that time he said I feel a wind just rushed through my body he said from that point I began to get better he said in a few days they took an x-ray he said when they took the X-ray the doctor came in they're mesmerized I've got the pictures he said the doctor came in they're mesmerized and said sir said the other day your lungs were deteriorating they were almost gone he said but today you got a brand new set of lungs he said in your body oh God in your body is a brand new set of lungs he said the other day they were about gone he said but today there's a brand Hulk I don't think y'all heard me there's a brand new set of lungs in your body who else could do that amen the doctor didn't give him a transplant amen but the wind the oxygen of Heaven blew by a hospital room in South Africa and breathed into a man of God's lungs and you know when I saw I thought brother will I'm hearing amen from creative lungs of almighty god brother

still moving and the Devil is a defeated foe you believe that the devil's a defeated fall and I tell you just to recognize that the Lord is here with us and God send that prophet he Vindicated that gift and we know beyond a shot of a doubt that the angel of the Lord according to Revelations 10 1. is here with us never laughed with the prophet that he's here with the bride Jesus Christ and we're so thankful for that and um the just received a text that brother Jewel fournies in need of prayer he had a stroke this afternoon after this service and he's going in for surgery now there's a blood clot on the brain and [Music] that God can dissolve blood clots and I I really love brother Jewell he's labored very hard preaching the gospel to the bride of Christ and he has stood with this message when even his closest friends have walked away [Music] he was offered you know when things went down there in North Carolina [Music] Pastor who was a beloved friend of his and let him to the Lord into this message then the pastor left the message and you all know the story but he offered brother Jewel a lot of money stay with him and I'll take care of every need you got and just stay with me and I know for for an evangelist and all that that stuff you know the the church was supporting brother Jewel financially helping him and things like that and so I'm sure the devil tempted him in that that manner uh you know just to to walk away from the message and accept all of this but brother Jewel he loved the message and he walked away from all his finances walked away from all of that to to walk with God and Satan has fought him in his body in many instances throughout the years since and the brother Joel has remained trying to Pastor trying to help God's people and I I think we ought to remember him in our prayer and so maybe we could just just bow our heads okay John's going to stand there and annoying brother John and I I just believe God will hear our prayer if God can give new lungs amen just God can restore our brother and and uh take that blood clot out of that brain and renew our brother so let's pray father God we we love brother Jewel [Music] his ministry has influenced Our Lives in many ways Lord even though we haven't heard him preached in a long time and we hadn't maybe talked with him but our hearts are still with him Lord father will remember his ministry and Lord as he has labored for us now we're going to labor for him and we're going to petition you father as as your children that you would go in that room now father and touch your servant oh God make him whole I pray father that you would bring him through this situation father Lord as he is trying to labor for the people there at that church I pray Lord that you would blessed his wife God just give her a peace in her heart Lord give brother Jewel peace Lord may your presence go in that hospital room even now father in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we have heard Lord today that Satan is a defeated Foe and Satan you have no right over the people of God will you just command you to leave God's servant in Jesus Christ's name we thank you Father and we believe for victory we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray hallelujah hallelujah can you just lift your hands and just thank God for answering the prayer father we thank you for answering we thank you Lord for moving on behalf of your servant father o God you're a God of Miracles you still answer prayer Lord we thank you father in Jesus Christ's name Blessed Be Your holy name man amen amen well again we certainly appreciate these young people and uh for laboring today or tonight in the service and they've just done a wonderful job and you know Satan fights these young people a lot and uh by sitting there tonight I I just thought they'd come to me as as to why I really believe that Satan is fighting you young peoples because he knows that you've got the gift you got the gift to drive him away he knows that he's going to do everything he can build complexes in your mind you're worthless that you're no good that you ain't got nothing to offer and God doesn't love you but you just remember a man that is through you your gift your talent yielding to the Lord you're going to drive him away drive him away from the people of God that's what the prophet said now music and singing song is used to drive Spirits away amen so you just remember that and that's why Satan fights you so hard amen but you will overcome amen just yield yourself to the Lord and I I really appreciated what brother Andrew is saying get under that influence of this message amen remember influences a man and you know brother Brown preaching on the invasion of the United States and Satan has found all this technology to invade your mind to invade the homes to invade these things and uh you know we not everything is prudent on these cell phones not every app is is is of a benefit to you and I I know we've got all kinds of you know apps where you take pictures of yourself and send them out and and you know you just all kinds of stuff people taking pictures of you know what food they're eating and then they send it out and a lot of that is your senseless stuff and it's it's really it's just Satan trying to get avert your attention away from everything else that God's got for you and uh you know it makes you just so carnal and and uh so come under the right influence come under the right influence and even though there they might seem harmless and innocent it's it's whatever's taking you away from the message of the hour and and bringing you to where you're more acceptable to to discouragement you're more susceptible to his he's the one that puts these thoughts of negativity in your mind and if you're not feeding up on the word then you become susceptible to it to where you start believing that and you start entertaining them thoughts and so God help us all to get away from all that and and just feed upon the word of God I uh you know and so anyways God bless you we love you appreciate you you want to keep brother Andrew in prayer at the Lord of his strengthen his body and you know go
