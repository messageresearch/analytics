musicians can be dismissed and trust everyone had a good day today and good at brother Amos back amen and just everyone and brother Bob and Sister Janice as well and um amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to first of all turn to the book of second Thessalonians a man or a first Thessalonians chapter 5 man and we want to remember brother Tim Farmers meeting this Friday starting and then Friday Saturday and Sunday and Friday and Saturday it's going to be at seven o'clock and so um it's Friday night's not going to be in the tent and they do that to the tornado warning they had taken the tent down but so it's going to uh be at the Rural Retreat Community Center their Rural Retreat Community Center and I've got the address if if you need that and and but then Lord willing the Saturday night service is going to be there at um in in the tent Under the Tent and so anyways I believe in the Lord to be with the services there I think brother Amos would be ministering Friday night and brother Joe Farmer uh Saturday night and then brother Tim Farmer Sunday so we want to keep them in prayer keep the the meeting in prayer and just believe in God bill uh do a great work and also we're going to only have one service this coming Sunday and we we're going to um I'm mainly doing it for the the young young people but anyone that wants to come and we're going to be having a a little service there at the nursing home at the Heritage Hall and that's going to be 3 30 to 4 30 and so I'm going to make it a a lack of service so if you want to come uh just we're not going to you know no talking and walking around and all that stuff uh we're we're just going to try to make it like a service and man we just don't want any distractions and so but if you'd like to come sing and we we would like to have you and be part of it and you know I I believe that there's uh there's got to be some so out there that we can reach and uh you know brother brother Branham he um LED that 90 year old lady to the Lord and and talking uh just listening to him the other day and he said that the uh there was a 75 year old 76 year old lady lived all of her life without serving the lord and and when she got about 75 76 she gave her heart to the Lord and and just shortly after went home to be with the Lord and so he says the Lord the Lord reached her and spared spared her life to where she could uh accept him and so you know that's that's what we're all about is trying to get souls amen and so um anyways uh here first Thessalonians the fifth chapter and the 17th verse and it's just a just a short reading here that it says pray without ceasing can you say that with me pray without ceasing amen let's just bow our hearts and our heads to the Lord and just ask for his help Father Lord as the songs have been sung the Praises have gone forward father I believe it has to warm your heart Lord as you redeemed set here tonight in a world of corruption when men are lovers of pleasure and they're turning aside to worldly things and leaving your feet dirty in the corner Lord that Hears A people that is expressing their love to you and father our desires that you would now speak to us through your word Lord and you know every need that is present we ask that you would just come Among Us now make yourself at home father feel welcome and Lord whatever you'd want to do in our hearts we pray that you would do it and meet every need is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen then we've got another scripture first Timothy First Timothy 2 and um if I can find it here amen getting close all right so first Timothy Chapter 2 and verse [Music] um eight we'll just do there it says I will that every I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting amen you can have your seats this evening in my title for just a few moments it will be um why we should pray and maybe very little is talked about prayer but it's going to be just a simple subject and but I guess I'm sharing uh my heart the experiences that I've been going through and I believe that prayer is important and um you know it's it's it's important that we pray and um I think every believer understands uh that prayer is part of Christianity and but maybe we underestimate the value of Prayer and and its importance but nonetheless we we do have places uh that uh or set aside or whatever that that uh um where we can pray uh for one the the this place the church house should be a place of Prayer and Jesus even said you know my house shall be called The House of Prayer if there's ever a time uh not not necessarily that we come here to fellowship with one another uh but it's it's set aside for us to meet with God and uh but also our home our home should be a place of prayer but the prophet says that it should be a constant place of Prayer that's that's what our our our our our uh uh homes every one of our homes should be is a constant place of Prayer but we know that God will hear our prayer anywhere we're at and and something about prayer Jesus encourages us to not just pray but to get along alone and and pray and here in Matthew 6 6 it says when thou herest or when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly and so then this tells us that you know uh it's there there's times in our life that it's it's a it's our prayer should just be alone with God alone not not with our family it's good to always pray with your family and I I come up short in that in in in in lot but I think every every night we should all together our families together and we should pray and uh but prayer uh also you know is is when we come in here we're praying but but then there's that time that we should get along with God just just just us and him and and pray and you know uh uh the woods the mountains are secret places is is a time just to get out and get alone and and talk with god um there and and the Bible talks of how that Jesus went to the mountain alone to pray and he done that often he he went alone just to get get along and and pray to the father and so brother Brown says when we pray in secret in other words when we get alone in in prayer he said there's some there seems to be something to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out of it it's because you're you're you're not just voicing with with others but but it's just you and God uh uh you and you begin to tell him your heart you begin to relay things that maybe you wouldn't want to share with anyone else and it's it it comes from the depth of our hearts and he says we we seem to get in better connection with God When We Get Alone and and so there's a reason why Jesus would tell us to get along pray in secret it's it's that there there's there's a connection there that that that you have a better connection and brother Brad um another place it says when we are alone we usually pray different than what we would if we pray it in the church when we're around people our prayer may be uh uh uh uh not not not as secret or not as Intense or not as uh open as we would when we're alone but it's when we're alone the greatest Revelation in Inspiration uh uh comes and and brother Branham another place he says if we would take more time to get along with God we would live a better life more Victorious Life In Christ so so I I think that these things are secrets that that you and I are blessed to to to know by by uh uh believing the message is the prophet is giving us uh Sharon's secrets to our Christian Life that if you want a Victorious life if you want a better life in Christ get along with God and and and pray now the prophet never devalued prayer he actually told us how essential uh prayer is to us and he even said that he spent uh a great part of his life in prayer brother Branham never took it uh uh lightly that he was just that he was a prophet he had a greater understanding of him being a prophet he was at a greater understanding as his ministry progressed that he was the Elijah of Malachi 4 and that he was the the seventh angel of of Revelations 10 7 and and he was his ministry was that of Luke 17 30 and and all of these things and but yet yet it it never them Revelations never uh uh got him to a place where he felt he didn't need to pray to God and get along with God it it actually it brought a greater responsibility I believe of or an awareness of how much he needed to pray and I think that is the the same thing with you and I as as the Revelation begins to uh become more clearer to us of this adoption and us being sons of God and and and us being the bride of Christ it it shouldn't take us away from prayer but it it it should put such an awareness that if this if we're part of such a Ministry if for part of such a saying that the Bible speaks of and and we're in the greatest stage ever and we're in the final of of of of of God's Vision it should cause us to pray even that much the more now you know brother Brown just re-quote here he said friends you may laugh too much you may talk too much you may walk too much but you'll never pray too much he said you may even sing too much you may even read too much you may even preach too much or whatever uh uh but you'll never pray too much prayer is valuable it's something that you could never ever ever do too much and another place he said now you Christians don't don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore lay aside everything are you with me lay aside everything and just get as close to God as you can walk with him talk with him and let everything everybody say let everything let everything be else be secondary but your prayer life stay right with him all the time ain't that right so so these are are are uh uh you know I I think he is not just telling us who we are but I think he is he is he is cementing these promises uh uh and he's really putting it into our lives and and showing us how these things become active in us and and these things it's just just kind of like you know if you put in the brick two bricks together well you know you can you can take that brick off any time but when you put the cement in there and you put that brick there then that then then the two bricks become apart they become a unit they become you understand what I'm saying hopefully and and so so we got all these promises about how do we apply it to our lives how do we stick it to our lives to where we become part of this and and I believe that it's it's through prayer it's it's prayer now prayer is the way of Believers and this is why this is why you should never yoke up with unbelievers because they have a different way they have a different Outlook they have for different uh pattern of doing things and how they handle their problems and how they handle their their issues and handle life and handle this and all these but but prayer is the way of of Believers now the Bible talks about King Jehoshaphat who was a righteous man but he had joined up with Ahab who was a lukewarm believer and and and to be honest a a lukewarm believer is nothing but an a religious unbeliever and and so uh uh it's an unbeliever in Disguise but uh uh so he had joined up with Ahab and Ahab convinced Jehoshaphat to do a certain thing uh uh uh without consulting the Lord first and and so when when he done that and now now Jehoshaphat was righteous amen but it doesn't it mean that a man I don't care if you're sitting under the message you can be led astray and I want you young people to understand that too you can be led astray I don't I don't care if you've got Christian parents you you you're sitting under the the greatest uh uh Ministry of of of all and or you're just sitting there just playing tapes uh uh you can be led astray and and so by yoking yourself up with the wrong crowd with the wrong things and and all these things and so but but Jehoshaphat got himself into trouble amen because he listened to Ahab uh uh and or his son ahab's son I believe it was and and and these things and the prophet said this he said now Jehoshaphat ordinarily now he said he would have prayed over the subject he would have thought about it first and and said God what must I do but being yoked up with unbelievers he took the unbeliever's way ain't ain't that right see he took the unbeliever's way and that's the way many Spirit-filled Christians after Revival they fall because they yoke themselves up amongst people that says well I go to church we're as good as the rest of them and you lose your experience so so prayer prayer keeps that Revival alive it it keeps that experience going if if you you don't have to just go from revival to Revival to Revival to stay pumped up there is a secret to keeping the Revival alive there is a secret a man to keeping god with you at all times and that's my prayer and so you lose your experience he says see stay right in the road no matter what the rest of them does you know where you belong you know who you belong to so stay right under the power of prayer all the time don't let them call you off to something else in amusements and so forth and saying there's no harm in this if there's a question to it don't do it stay away from it can you say man and I think we ought to question a man a lot of things that goes on a man whether it's in our home or amen what Hollywood is bringing out I know I hit all that all the time but I'm I'm finding that more and more that that we better hit against these things amen because uh uh our young people are are accepting these things they're accepting all these technology and they're accepting all these things without questions to it and said where is this going to lead me what is this going to do to me amen but I'm telling you not everything is applicable for your Christian walk with God now brother Brown said stay under the power of Prayer and I want to just say this you know Jehoshaphat had hadn't heard uh you know they'd got he got him himself in trouble they they were in a place without water and and you know you you know the story but Jehoshaphat had heard that Elisha was close by and and had and heard that he had poured water on the hands of Elijah and and when when he heard that then it it done something to Jehoshaphat because him pouring the water on the hands of Elijah it showed that he was in association with with the real prophet he brother Abraham says it it meant that he had some dealing with the real Prophet ain't that right and and Elisha uh of course represents the church uh uh uh today he's he's a type of the church and and Jehoshaphat knew that if if Elisha had anything to do with Elijah then the word of the Lord was with Elisha amen and you know uh there's that saying that says birds of a feather flock together a man and brother Branham says how can you expect anybody to believe you when you're running around and acting the way you do and then come in and call yourselves Christians no wonder they don't call for you to come and pray for them and so forth so so see he was talking to the the Pentecostals and the denomination and all of that and and living Wordly and then coming to church and and and professing something amen but see uh uh Jehoshaphat just didn't want any counsel he he didn't want just anybody giving him Direction amen he wanted somebody that that that had the word of the Lord and so when he had heard that Elisha a man was Associated uh uh went to Elijah and had dealings with Elijah then he knew that this man must have the word of the Lord and they went to him and of course you know although Elijah was gone the prophet said there was somebody close by a man that poured water on the hands of Elijah and had a double portion of his spirit and they went to him for the for the answer they didn't go to the counselors they didn't go to the seminaries they didn't go to the psychologist or or whatever they they went to him that had poured water amen it had dealings with the prophet of God ain't that right and I say to you that Us by by us pouring a man water on Elijah's message and this day shows what we are associated associated with ain't that right Amen brother Branham you know he says show me your company and I'll show you what you are amen that's right and and so we're pouring water upon this message we're and and you say well how are we doing that by our Praises ain't that right amen that that's what brother Brandon said remember he even talked about uh Rebecca watering the camels and and and the camels are it was a beast and it it represented power amen and and and he says see Rebecca watered amen the very power amen the Beast that was going to take her to her Isaac and he says we are watering the very power of this day that's going to take us to our Isaac and he said we're watering it by our Praises ain't that right amen no wonder the devil hates praising God in the church no wonder he wants us and they call it fanatical they call it sensation they call it everything and I hope there ain't one here that's just a flat unbeliever because if you are amen you need to get right with God Amen man because a prophet a man was he he now you know uh he he wanted Praises can you say amen he encouraged praises and and if there's ever a time that a people ought to praise God it's now amen there's people that just sit there in the Molly grubs and and they worry about every problem and they worry about everything and let the devil just beat them up amen but God has called us to worship God and to praise God and to lift up holy hands with that wrath or doubting ain't that right God forbid that we become formal in the house of God God forbid amen that we lose amen our Thanksgiving and our worship ain't that right amen because that's what you're doing you're watering you're watering you're keeping the power strong you're keeping it alive by your Praises ain't that right so brother Branham says see take God's word for it and start rejoicing something will happen and that brings the word to life as we water it with praises see what makes a seed grow water and what makes the word of God grow is the Praises of God in other places he said if you'll take any Divine promise of God made in his Bible put it in your heart and water it every day with the Praises of God that's going to come to pass it'll grow ain't that right so what we're doing is we're watering the word which is the message of the hour we're not watering and and and you know we're not watering some big preachers you know uh uh message we're not watering some uh theologians message we're not watering we're watering Elijah's message of this day ain't that right amen so so so Elisha was a type of us today amen and and Jehoshaphat realize that a man was up on the earth a man that had been us had dealings amen with Elisha by poor or Elijah by pouring water her upon him now uh uh on his hands and so we we look and and I believe that that the people if the people know where the word of the Lord and who has the real word of the lord we are a people that that that have the true word of the Lord do you believe that amen and of course we know the holy spirit is the Elijah of today amen and that's what we're really watering amen that's what we're pouring our water Upon Our Praises upon we're not worshiping a man a man the holy spirit is the Elijah of today that that that he is the prophet and and that that worked uh through the the the the body of of William Branham amen but brother Branham said this sick and sinful world today is looking to a real Church of the Living God who possesses a double portion of his Spirit ain't that right amen see but but Jehoshaphat amen he got away from prayer he he got away and and uh uh you know I if you notice prayer is how we stay connected with God amen prayer I I you know and and hopefully this will help you in some way but you know it's not just all coming and hearing the word it's not all just about understanding the Mysteries it's not all just about you know playing the tapes and and now you all know I'm a big big Advocate about that I play the tapes man get it in your home that message of this hour should be planned in your home all the time but but it's not all about that I you you you can play the tapes and not have relationship with God you you you you you you know you understand you can come to church how many people go to church in the message and still just fat and defeat and fatten this and fighting that and struggling and and all of these things well you've got to stay under the power of Prayer prayer is how we stay connected with God can you say man God doesn't want you just become an educated message I believe her he he wants fellowship with you they ain't that right so now why why uh uh uh should Believers pray well there's power in prayer Amen brother Brown said Prayer Changes Things uh prayer changes death to life prayer changes sickness to hell it changes Sinners to Saints it's prayer and I you know uh I I cannot change the situation you cannot change the situation we we can look at our situations that we're dealing with and and you know hey throw up your hands and quit right you ain't got a chance with it and and I think God allows these things to happen Amen to where we just we've talked till we've talked until we're blue in the face we we you know there's times brother Andrew well we we just preach and tell we've just preached out you know you know we sung until we sung out we've we played the music till we're just played out you know we've done everything till we just can't do it no more you understand what I'm saying amen but see you're not helpless until you get down into prayer can you say man it's true you you can you can witness well I've talked you know you can say well I've I've I've talked to my spouse and and and it just ain't getting nowhere I've talked to my children it just ain't getting anywhere I they're getting they're getting worse I've I've tried to change situations on my job and it just ain't helping I I've tried to talk and talk and talk and talk sometimes you're talking to the wrong person you need to talk to God can you say man stay in connection with God see so you can't change it I can't change it but what can change it prayer everybody say prayer Prayer Changes Things and Prophet said prayer is the greatest weapon known to man ain't that right now see it's the greatest weapon known to man now now I I don't think we ever hear of anybody saying this in just nominal churches but we are sitting under a message of Malachi 4 a man that is given us the secrets Amen to life given us the secrets Amen to solving the problems giving us the secrets Amen to overcoming and that is prayer is the greatest weapon well that's why we don't look to a politician we've got prayer that's why we don't look to preachers we got prayer that's why we're not looking to programs we got prayer amen that's all right we're not looking to everything else to fix the problem we've got prayer and every one of us has it in our hands [Applause] prayer all right that's true brother Brown said he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that's prayer prayer everybody say prayer is what changes things notice what he says the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has say that again the Christian does not realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what power that is amen we're not a people that should be scared and fearful amen and thinking oh God Amen we're not to sit here and imagine Amen Let The Devil it calls us to imagine the worst about our children and the worst about our family and and imagine the worst about the church and the worst about our lives and and and all of these things quit entertaining them things amen you got the power to change it and that's prayer prayer he said he doesn't realize what power that is if the people could only realize what is given right unto them anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for God's word is true ain't that right so prayer amen prayer we're we're looking at at Russia we're looking at China we're looking amen they're already flexing their muscles they're they're they're they're they're you know we're we're sending ships you know uh uh there to meet them they're the you know they're close to Alaska and and and all of these things and the world is about to bust and and we all know what what the end of it's going to be it's it's going to be an explosion but there's going to be a people that will not experience that they they they they're in a different Channel we we're not operating under military power we're operating under the power of prayer can you say Amen it's it's prayer see prayer is more powerful than any atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb amen it moves mountains it closes the mouths of lions it takes the heat of the out of the fire ain't that right amen it causes the the baron to receive seed amen it causes the weak to become strong amen prayer is is is there's power in prayer brother Brown said there's no greater power in the world than prayer can you say amen amen so you don't need a position in the Army you don't need to be high ranking you don't need to be next to the president the king or or whatever you you've got it sitting right with you in the in your Pew amen and that is prayer prayer can you say Man Prayer it's it's it's no greater power in the world than prayer Jesus said there in Matthew 21 and 21 and all things everybody say all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive amen so so that takes the belly aching that takes the griping that takes the wandering that takes the worry that takes the fear from us if we can really believe that scripture that whatever I shall ask whatsoever I shall ask and he says all things he didn't say something you quit limiting God Amen and and and and and and putting God in in a in in a a boundary that God you can only do this and if he gets out of there if mine if my children If my spouse if my loved one if if the situation gets out of that box I just don't know what I'm going to do amen but he says in all things whatever you're needing whatsoever you ask believing is this okay see God's word is true is it not God's word is true we read in the Bible where Jesus was directed to go somewhere because of somebody praying it's interesting how the prophet would give us the Insight on things that Matthew 4 35 and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass this is Jesus speaking let us pass over onto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full now just to stop there there's a reason why he's going to the other side is that right there's a soul amen there's a soul that is lost there's a soul that is in need of help and there is a reason as to why Satan has caused this storm to come and the the winds and the waves to to start acting up to sink the ship ain't that right you see he he he he knows he knows who Jesus is he knows the power that Jesus he's met him before and and and he knows a man he he doesn't want that so helped he doesn't want that so delivered you understand what I'm saying if you could understand the spiritual warfare that we have a lot of times amen well Jesus had them spiritual warfares as well anytime you really try to do something for God and I'm talking about I'm not talking about passing your Donuts out to help people and to give bicycle ways and start your little programs and be a little fighting your little messages I'm talking about real power with God that if you really are going the only way you can help amen is through the message of the hour can you say amen amen well any time that you start trying to help people amen and whether it's it's out there when in Souls whether you're trying to establish people in the message of the hour or whatever I be assured all hell is going to break loose amen because Satan understands the power that you have amen you see if you were just preaching a little Baptist Doctrine amen he ain't gonna mess with you there amen what what you know you understand what I'm saying if you're just preaching some little Pentecostal uh uh uh little little shout and shim dig and all that it that does I've been there it doesn't establish the people that when you preach the message amen it starts taking the people out of the grass of Satan it starts establishing them and amen to where they begin to walk on their own they begin to talk upon their own they begin to exercise The Authority up on their own because they began to realize of who they are so every time a message breacher is preaching the message you know what you're doing you're delivering a soul from the hands of the devil it's true amen that's right so Jesus he was the message of the hour he was the he he was the one and he's going to help amen Satan knows it so Satan now becomes a spiritual warfare hey Jesus is trying to get some sleep he's tired he's had a he's had a hard day he's had a long prayer line he's had all this thing but Satan don't care about that if I can just sink that man amen it'll be over ain't that right amen well that's the same way amen if he can sink you if he can get you away amen from this message then then I don't care you're singing you're preaching your music uh everything that you do ain't gonna help can you say Amen well it's true see so so we find a man that that Satan wanted to sink it but then if you notice Jesus didn't Panic he didn't he you know he's had this relationship with the father and and and he was a he was a man of prayer and and so he just stood up and he rebukes the winds and the waves and and continues on to reach that one Soul ain't that right amen now who is it that he is after Mark 5 and and one it says and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the Gatherings and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit so now we understand this is the soul that Jesus was after this is the reason why Satan was trying to sink that ship destroy that Ministry tear him apart amen because of this one Soul a man that needed help ain't that right now notice he had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains because he had been uh often bound with Fetters and chains and and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the Fetters broken pieces and neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying cutting himself a man was stoned so this man was in bad shape ain't that right and when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I adjour Thee my God that thou tort meant me not now it was the devil speaking through that man and he said unto him come out of that man thou unclean spirit and Jesus asked him what is your name and he answered and said my name is Legion for we are many now I I don't know maybe a couple thousand I don't know what Legion is is it a thousand or two thousand so this was a man that was totally I mean demon possessed right man two thousand demons but see he was that soul that Jesus was after and and he besought him that he would not uh uh uh sin uh that he would not send them away out of the country it says now there was nigh unto the mountains a a great herd of swine feeding and all the Devils beside him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and forth with Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep Place into the sea a man and and they were choked in the sea ain't that right uh uh they were they were about two thousand and they they were choked in the sea and they and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done and they came to Jesus and see him that was possessed of the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind hey ain't that right so so so now now this is what what the devil done uh uh to them that swine what them two thousand demons done to that hurt us Hogs amen they were trying to do that to to this man and and so is it today amen Satan is trying his best to destroy the people of God you say man now I I you know I I wished I could just open my heart to you and but but you know Satan going to do everything he can you any any time that you start working for God Satan gonna attack he's going to attack you believe that you're going to attack your children gonna attack your your your your marriage you're going to attack your home you're gonna attack the church he's going to attack the he's going to attack he is just everywhere and and the people that were sent out to help them are the people that he's trying to destroy the most in my opinion we always talk about the last Soul getting the last Soul well you know I I believe that it could be that this this this that last Soul could be so demon-possessed amen but it's going to take somebody with the the real power of the Holy Ghost to set that man free all right amen ain't that right well Jesus had What it Took but now notice what caused Jesus to come after him all right brother Branham tells us see Jesus went over there at the Cry of one person one poor Maniac lost his mind perhaps a good man at one time walked up right before God but probably got in the wrong crowd might be started drinking again or something and lost his mind he lived out in the tombs where the demons lived put him in Chains and he had Supernatural Powers see and he'd break those chains and jump on men and beat them and killed him if he could and when they came by and that poor little fella maybe he had an old gray-headed mother somewhere praying for him and you say Amen now that just struck me just the power of prayer a mama did not look at the situation a mama didn't consider that that that he could break change did not consider that his her boy become a murderer amen did not consider that that the town a man did not want him and could not help him did not consider that the doctors couldn't help him psychologists couldn't help him there was no human effort that could help her boy but she began to pray [Music] and you say man she was there somewhere praying and Jesus crossed the sea all the way over into Galleria to give Mercy to one man and he'll do the same tonight where one humble soul is calling to him he'll cross the Seas or leave the Heavens to answer that prayer it's the same Jesus the yesterday today and forever can you say amen God answers prayers we read about Zacchaeus in the Bible how he was the rich sinner did not believe that Jesus was a prophet but his wife was a follower Jesus Rebecca really random again lets us in on it on the situation and she prayed can you say it with me she prayed she prayed for her husband brother Brahm says you know when you get to praying for a fella he kind of gets in bad shape I think that's when people stop praying and thinking that their prayers ain't being answered well I prayed and look it's getting worse well now you've got a prophet that's going to tell you when you start praying things get worse ain't that right but he says if you want somebody saved or something done just start praying for them he said that's the reason we don't he said see prayer is the greatest thing was ever put in the hands of man not medication not technology not professionals prayer the prophet goes on to tell us that the night before Jesus was to come to their town Rebecca didn't sleep at all she laid beside her husband praying he said she'd look out the corner of her eye and saw that Zacchaeus Was Restless but she's praying and the prophet gives us Insight again on what she was praying and she said Lord I know you're dealing with him I know you're dealing with him now Jesus the prophet is coming into the town for this meeting down here and I want him to see him so bad Lord would you make a way now just make Kim miserable just make him so he can't sleep and there he was he couldn't sleep she had dozed off he said so that all right that's fine so the next morning she had dozed off to sleep laying praying all night and if you want your husband saved now you do the same thing Rebecca did and just start praying for him hello it ain't time that to get wrapped up in other things it it ain't time to let unbelievers draw you away from the power of Prayer amen you just start praying for him and you know out there on the sea when he's out there fishing or down there in the business and he will get so under conviction he can't sleep that's right if you want your wife saved you do the same thing and she'll come away from every card party and everything else she belongs to see yes sir she'll do it see see oh there's just great power in prayer now Jesus said here in Acts 1 and 8. and I don't know if I gave that to you may have but it says you shall receive power everybody say I shall receive power I shall receive power after what the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power so the Holy Ghost come to give you power ain't that right amen Power Authority see there's power and brother Brian said what is it he came to give you power in prayer where are you not just uttering words now but he come to give you power in your prayer now so now now we know what the Holy Ghost is in this age right it's the token in the days of Exodus we we we're familiar with it but God required a token and the knowledge of that Tolkien came by way of the prophet's message Moses how to apply the token came through the messenger of the hour Moses's message ain't that right and back then that token was the literal blood of uh of a natural lamb but today the token for us is the literal life of Jesus Christ living within the believer now brother Brad I'm talking about uh there in the first Exodus he says the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days and then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time he said you get it the toe can never come into existence until the evening time and this is the evening time of the age that we're living in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me this is the evening time of my message I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel and we've come up to justification and so forth but this is the time that the token must be applied now we know again the Holy Ghost is the token the life brother Branham there in the Feast of the trumpet said the Holy Ghost has been bound up by these denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years but it is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again the Tolkien in the church ain't that right the power in the church see Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it that's right see so here Jesus is saying you shall receive power you shall receive the authority after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you see and so what is that token when the Holy Ghost come what is the token a sign of it's a sign that the blood has been applied still on prayer the blood's been applied Hebrews 12 24 tells us that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things than of Ables blood ain't that right the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed it speaks better things it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you from the wrath of God are you with me it hide you from the wrath of God it's speaking better things amen see the blood of Abel could not hide Cain but the blood of Jesus can so old Cain come out come out today if you've been a persecutor against the word and say the days of Miracles has passed and this thing is all nonsense and things it's crying out you see the blood of Jesus cries out but there is forgiveness in it if you'll accept it so you wish we could stay on that a while the see the blood speaketh better things see belief believe for safety then apply see believe for it see here's what you want to uh you want to believe for see you want you you want your own safety believe for your safety and then apply the token for the whole family you say man see it's putting in your hands because you've got the token we don't need a preacher for Revival we don't need some personality Pentecostals rely upon the gifts for Revival but what brings this revival is a token can you say man that's right he's telling you you're not helpless if you got a token that's right so you apply the token for the whole family you say how can I do that claim it everybody say claim it if you worked you see if it worked on you then you and the word becomes one amen amen he says see it works for both of you you and the word are one then apply it to your children apply it to your loved ones now notice in another place he's still preaching on the token then when we pray see you're not people pray everywhere but you're different in that you have a token then when you we pray we must have the token to present with our prayers hello see see how you're so blessed brother Branson to be in the message people don't know what a token is out there they they think well in order to they they're identified with with denominations they're identified with personalities they're identified with theology there I see identified with psychologists but were identified with the message of the hour that has showed us what the token is and how to apply it so what does brother Brown tell us what does the prophet say he's the one that's given to the the the the uh just as Moses told them how to apply the token he tells us how to plaque get the trash out of your home get the nonsense out of your home get the movies out of your home get get the television out of your home come on now get them romance novels out of your home get the country music out of your home get that rock and roll out of your home get whatever is against this word get it out of your home token doesn't work when you're when you're holding on to all of this idolatry out there hello see you got to get it out you got to get it out because then you got to apply the token to your home then when you pray you got a token to present with your prayer good evening right is that all right amen he said as I said now believe for ourself and apply the token to the whole family now see that puts you in power than it does everybody else that means the devil has no right over your family so whatever the devil's doing don't be despondent and worry and throw yourself in a panic apply the token amen good brother brother Brown's telling us what this token is about you see Moses told him what the token was apply the token and get under that token death Angel's coming but you don't have to worry about it right there was no there was no crying on in that home that had the token there was no Sovereign in the home that had the token there was no worry in in in that home that was under the token because they believed in what that Prophet said they believe that if Moses told him how to do it and they done it then they didn't have to worry we all know the story you know just just just uh um looking in into maybe what it was like the boy you know he's the first he's the firstborn he's heard what the prophet said that if that token ain't there the death Angel's going to come and kill him right and he sees he's starting to hear the crying he's starting to hear the Wailing in homes that don't have the token and he sees that dark shadow approaching and he's starting to get a little worried Daddy it's coming are you sure it's applied and daddy probably put his arms around and says son don't you worry about it at all daddy made sure that we've done exactly what a prophet told us to do we made sure that we did not slap the prophet at all that we believed his word and we acted upon what he's told us we applied the message to our home we believe it son and we've done everything that he said now let's just stand here and let's rejoice and praise God [Music] can you say man so apply it he said see you you you plot to the whole family like each like in Egypt in Jericho or either in either in Acts 16 31 see we find out that Paul told the the Roman Centurion believe thou and all thy house shall be saved see apply it to your family if you got an unsaved child lay the token right on top of him and say Lord God I claim him I claim my children I claim my children tell my child the other day devil can't have you I claim you all get bold and just tell your children devil can't have you devil can't have you I'm praying for you I'm praying for you there's a blood for you it's it's speaking on your behalf I know the devil's after him they can't have them no service no sir no sir how in the world am I going to defeat it I got a token I'm believing what a prophet says can you say Amen Church yes sir apply it to your family see so Lord I claim him right stay right there if you've got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay that token on them and say Lord God I claim it now if you're going to live like the devil then you you can't you can't use the token if you're going to live in unbelief you can't use the token if you're going to sit there and argue with the prophet you cannot use the token the token is an applicable all right all right come on Amen but you shall you shall receive power so he's speaking to those who have the token in this age hello there's a lot of good people a lot of a lot of good men women going to church they don't have a token there's a foolish virgin right now I'm talking about people that's got a token now brother Brian said you take a person that's lived a good life but they're always defeated oh I I tell you you know a good person oh I sure love the Lord brother Branham but see always defeated they never get a prayer answered he said you feel that little woman with the Holy Ghost one time and watch what takes place when she goes before God she's not defeated she comes boldly to the throne of God believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God by a birth take that little man so cowardly the Boss Kick him all over the place and say wait wait a minute here now see something's changed he's got the Holy Ghost see he gives you power and your fluff is full of power yeah amen and your prayer your prayer is full of power it has power because you are a son and daughter of God amen now we know it but as redeemed sons of God we are right now the prophet said above the angels of God an angel is a servant and we're Sons and Daughters of God and he says which is the most thought of your servant or your son or daughter he said oh my a prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel because he's a son he said oh whoo he said that's right my brother's sister the church I don't believe this side of Eternity and how we'll ever realize that what you are the position that you are that God has placed you Spirit-filled people you're sons of God and Angel's a servant you're a son and an angel can only bring you a message but you have to act you're the actor on the scene you're the son ain't that right so the angel ain't doing the praying for us all right because he's not in the position that we are in but you are in that position as a Son of God the daughter of God you're the one who is predestinated to be conformed to the image Christ never died for Angels he died for his children ain't that right Jesus never told the angels that if you say to this mountain doubt not it shall be cast into the sea he never told angels The Works that I do is greater than these shall you do he never told that to Angels he told his children Sons and Daughters these promises are to you ain't that right we are his offspring which means that we're part of God if I can say it this way we're part of the godhead because it's Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you the hope of glory and you say Amen people might get stumped on that being part of the godhead but you know the more I see it about the message I see that's what we are amen we're part of the godhead we're part of God it was it was God above us God With Us God in us and we're at the place not God With Us God is in US can you say amen God having the preeminence go go listen to Christ is the mystery of God revealed the whole secret is God having having that preeminence in his church to where she becomes him that she is one with him she she is bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him ain't that right we're Made In His Image and in his likeness Angels did not come from him they were created by Him but you and I are his bride which means that we come out of him we were a part of him we're being in him all along we're not a separate entity brother Bram said we become part of his word part of his life for we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life ain't that right and if you notice what he was Jesus said there in Revelations 1 8 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending now that that just looks like it's just just all about him and we take it and and we put it just to that one that one uh man if we can put it that way that one body Alpha and Omega the beginning the ending but as the Mysteries have unfolded we begin to understand there's more to this you see he's Alpha and Omega Alpha is the first Omega is the last brother Brown said he never said what he was in between he just said I'm the alpha and the Omega he never said in anything in between can you say amen and the and the Alpha and the Omega is the same thing for he said I am the alpha I am the Omega that one person Jesus Christ is the Alpha and the Omega ain't that right now we saw him as the alpha when he walked the Earth we see what he was in his first ministry as the alpha we saw what he'd done in his ministry as the alpha can you say Amen as Alpha he was the full manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh dwelt Among Us that's exactly what he was ain't that right well then if he is Omega then what he was as Alpha he will be in Omega ain't that right so brother Branham says the first Ministry and the last Ministry thank you so much the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same can you say that with me the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message the last message is the same I was in Alpha I am in Omega there will be a day that won't be called day nor night but in the evening time it shall be light Alpha and Omega it's become the first and the last and brother Brown said the alpha has now become Omega ain't that right and then he says he is everything what he was in the and and that he was when he walked the Earth he's everything except in the Corporal body why he doesn't need that Corporal body on Earth for you are his body he's able to have preeminence in you ain't that right so brother Brown said all the powers that God had rested in Christ and the fullness of Christ everybody say the fullness of Christ rest in his church so now we understand where the old what he is as Omega he's Omega in his church deities not in heaven it's in you brother Brown said the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ's manifested in his power in fullness in his church do you believe that maybe this is Elementary to you or maybe you don't believe it but I believe it listen now the last thing that the church is going to see the last thing is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church I mean he's part of his church then that's the last thing you're going to see Christ in you not a helpless Christ not a Christ that has changed but what he was back then he's still the same yesterday today and forever in you well and then have you ever read in the scriptures where Jesus was defeated answer was Jesus defeated in his his life when he walked the Earth did did he act defeated did he live defeated every time he met the devil did he overcome the devil can you say man did he did he exercise as the Messiah is that not what the prophet said we are as Messiah it's showing that the alpha has become Omega in US hello then would we not hold the same title we're not the Savior but the savior is in US then notice the power of your prayer if there's ever a people that the devil cannot whip it's this bride you know the prophet says that that that that that just paraphrase him but you know he hadn't met a lot of guys met the prophets he meant and all kinds of guys but when he met Jesus he met him on a different level when he met Jesus he got us he got his feather singed yeah he he got a hold of a wire of uh ten thousand votes and you say man why he was Alpha God made flesh the word made flesh do you realize that the devil's had his way through all these Church ages but it's in this age that this church will not denominate this age that the church will not be divided it's in this age that everything that he has taken and will be restored and he cannot take it away he took it away from all the the church through all the ages that God restored it back to us and the devil cannot take it from us every time he meets us he gets his feather singed why he's it's the same Alpha it's the same God that he met in in the mountain of trans of Temptation is the same God that he's meeting you in this age here [Applause] I hope I'm making sense to you brother Brown said see we're not a divided people we got to be in unity because of each one of us holding a part of God we must come together then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sets together in Heavenly places then the fullness everybody say the fullness of the power of God is in his church man come on another place he says any believer that's got the Holy Spirit you have the power of God within you don't underestimate the Holy Ghost don't don't underestimate it however you got the Holy Ghost you may have got it set in a Pew you know you can do that you can get the Holy Ghost sitting in a pew you don't have to come to an altar you you can get the Holy Ghost out in the woods you can get the holy ghosts in the car though however you get the Holy Ghost there's got to be a power with it there's a power with it and you say Amen and what that power is is a full Authority given to you remember how it changed Peter he's a coward look what he was but when he got the Holy Ghost he was changed I I hope I'm helping any believer that's got the Holy Spirit you have the power of God within you or the authority to pray the prayer of faith now your prayers just ain't bouncing against the wall you've got the authority the power to pray the prayer of faith and you say man now we've said it before but I'm going to go back over it just for a moment then I'll let you go the prayer is a must you believe it prayer is not an option not to us not as Believers prayer is a must because see God cannot do anything until you ask you got to ask Matthew 9 37 Jesus said to his disciples that Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth labors into his Harvest Brown said he was the lord of the Harvest so he was saying to them pray to me pray to me that I will send laborers into my Harvest which I'm just telling you is such an easy thing part of it lays see in human beings the kingdom of God lays within the human being so Jesus is telling them you ask me what I know needs to be done I know it needs to be done if I can't do it until you ask and when you ask then I can act upon your prayer and you say man if you want to know what the will of God is for your life pray if you need God to do something for you pray you need the blessings of God pray him down ain't that right James 5 14 any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he had committed sins they shall be forgiven him power and prayer confess your faults one to another and pray for one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man Avail as much now the prophet said that that phrase effectual fervent it means desperation so sometimes now our prayers got to come from desperation I hope it's helping but I you go back and listen to read what brother Brown talks about he said the reason why people can't pray over five minutes because they're backslid they're they're too worldly they're too materialistic they got their minds on everything else and they can't enter into prayer so he says we just say this little prayer Lord just bless me keep me Keep John and I'm going to bed sometimes your prayers got to be from a desperation sometimes you got to pray until you get through right so brother Brown said see stay with it until it's answered Elijah James as he's talking about this fervent effectual prayer he goes right under that to Elijah how Elijah was a man of like passion just as we are brother Brown said in other words he had his ups and downs and his difference just like us but he was a righteous man who prayed ain't that right brogram says this no man is righteous only the Son of God so we don't stand I don't stand in my righteousness I stand in his righteousness so as long as I'm Anointed with him it's the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous Christ interceding for you through me to have you believe or what a prayer what a statement now our prayers changing isn't it it's Christ illness the one that's doing the praying it's Christ in us that is doing the interceding so is that not what prayer is an intercession we make intercession with our prayer and you say Amen making intercession for others now the Bible says that Elijah prayed earnestly that it might not rain so then the prophets to whom that the word of the Lord came to they had to pray because that's the law of God James 4 2 says you have not because you ask not or you pray not that right and brother Branham says you don't ask or pray because you don't believe but even the men to whom the word of the Lord came to had to find time to pray that's true now notice he prayed and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years in six months James 5 18 says and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit but now notice that's all we read about in that that scripture but if you go in First Kings 18 and 41. Elijah when he prayed he didn't just pray one time and get up and say well okay I prayed now it's up to God no he prayed and he prayed and he prayed can you say man First Kings 18 41 and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up now notice the word has already came to him and and he tells Ahab get the up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain so Elijah must have had a vision of rain coming or he wouldn't have said that to Ahab so Ahab went up to Eaton to drink and Elijah went to the top of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees you know what he was doing he was praying for rain and you say Amen and he said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went look he went up and looked and said there's nothing and and Elijah told him go again seven times so he would pray and time go go look come back there ain't nothing Elijah get on his knees and start praying again go look look up there come back there ain't nothing he'd get on his knees and start praying again can you say Amen and it came to pass at the seventh time he said behold there arise with a little cloud of the sea out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up and say unto Ahab prepare thy chair and get thee down that the rain stopped thee not and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and you say Amen what about Elijah when he prayed for the shunamite woman's son that was dead the Bible says there in Second Kings 4 32 and when Elisha was come into the house behold the child was deadly up on his bed and Elisha went in therefore and shut the door upon them Twain and prayed unto the Lord now that's all we hear about but brother Bradham said he prayed and he prayed and he prayed and you say man and he went up and laid up on the child and put his mouth upon his mouth his eyes upon his eyes his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the Flesh of the child wax warm Hallelujah you see so we we find as I get ready to go it takes not just prayer it takes persistence in prayer can you say man Jesus even taught us to be persistent with our prayer Luke 18 1. and he's spake unto a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and to faint not saying there was a city in a uh in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but after he said within himself though I fear not God nor regarding man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weareth me and the Lord said here what the unjust judge saith and shall not God avenge his own uh elect which cried day and night unto him though he bear along with them can you say man if the musicians will come brother Brian says the first thing you have to do if you're going to find Christ you've got to know that you've got a need of him and when you think you just don't need him then you'll never find him because you won't search him diligently did you notice the scripture where it says seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened actually that's not just knock see he knocks once he says and it opens he that's not just say see well I went out Lord here I am you want me no that's not it he that seeketh he that knocketh continuation brother Brown just keeps knocking see on that Pulpit keeps knocking see it it has to compare with the rest of the scriptures like the unjust judge and the widow she knocked constantly knocked on his door she was persistent if he turned her away today tomorrow she was on his hands again that's the way you want to get to get God be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time constantly just keep seeking keep asking keep knocking just don't knock a little while and get tired and go away just keep standing there Lord I'm here and I'm not going to turn I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands now I'm going to stay right here you getting tired of listening I I see he says I'm I'm having a great time knocking because I know you're coming amen that's when something happens he has to get you off of his hands so he comes out to answer you [Music] you love him [Music] knock seek that's what prayer is amen get alone with God

spend time prayer realizing Who We Are amen there's so many needs that you know are present of course it's it comes with being human but it also it comes with being Christians being believers Satan a fight is intense many times Satan likes would love to bring our hands down to this to discourage us to cause us to hang our head low thinking that we're just trapped thinking that it's just impossible situations but it's not impossible not with believers because we've got the greatest weapon no matter how long it takes no matter what what what happens we got to keep knocking and no matter how bad the situation looks and how rough it is there's still a God that can answer the need you're still a God that can change the situation around and so much that brother random sits is to Lisa that no matter how Wayward that loved one is that lost son or daughter no matter how Wayward they are even if God has to put them on a death bed they'll be saved anyhow that's a promise why because we're a people that's got a token plot with our prayer prayer can you say man remember one another in our prayer When you pray pray for those that are sick for those that are discouraged pray for one another we rely upon each other's prayers it's out of the prophet of God of the ministry that he had and yet he would never be so up that he would tell the people this happens because of your prayers pray for me and prayers I'll tell you now your pastor needs your prayers and I know brother Andrew brother Terry the ministers were Josiah they need your prayers moms and dads they need your prayers our young people need our prayers amen so God bless you thank brother Kevin y'all leaving tomorrow headed out tomorrow or someday they're headed out sometime this week to weekend to to Ohio so we want to keep
