closer to the coming of the Lord amen it should just build such expectation within us amen and uh the musicians can be dismissed amen and uh if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Philippians the 2nd chapter amen we been reading this um past few Services I reckon but Philippians the second chapter and the um third verse we will uh start there uh but before we go into the word may we just bow our heads I uh Sister Kim weeks had text me there in the office saying that she just really needing our prayers um having a bad day I guess with her knees and oh Jes so um maybe we can just pray uh for her as well father Lord we just intercede Lord for our sister father we your children Lord She's suffering with that arthritis and whatever would be aing her and just praying father that you would reach down to that room where where she's at father and touch her oh God we know that you are a miracle worker father that you can just uh cause every that body that knes to go back to normal father and pray that you would just take the pain away father may we just uh uh hear a testimony of your miraculous power I pray father that You' just raise her up father father Lord we just uh uh believing that to be done Lord and father just pray that you would help us tonight give us the words to say may your anointing be with us father I pray Lord just draw us closer to you Lord we ask it in your lovely name Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the Lord uh the book of Philippians the second chapter I forgot my glasses so we're going to try this here but it says um third verse let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in Christ which was also in Christ Christ let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross amen then if you'd like to turn with me to the book of Galatians the 5th chapter Galatians chapter 5 and um the we'll read the 26th verse says let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another and envying one another amen you can have your seats this evening praise the Lord I um want to maybe just continue on that thought that this morning the son of man came to minister and um one thing uh that Jesus shows us uh in his life and that is that it takes humility uh to minister to others and humility is a a very powerful thing and uh brother brandham really actually talks uh uh quite a bit on on humility and um you know uh have you ever just wondered why we do foot washing uh brother brandham says it's it's because it's an act of humility and um and so uh humility is is a great thing and this is actually what Jesus did when he washed his the disciples feet he was it was showing the humility within him amen and uh then he says I leave this as an example uh that you should do as I have done unto you and so uh uh brother brandham he says we want to be humble more than anything else because that that's the secret to power can you say Amen now I thought about our ministering um our our ministering is different than just the average um uh I guess the norm of of way uh most do um you know a lot of them pass tracks out and uh you know they'll they'll have soup supper or they'll have have a movie night or they'll have have something to draw the crowd in and and um you know and then you know uh uh joining up uh uh with a denomination or uh just so many things there but for us our ministry is a Ministry of power and uh if if there's ever a time that the gospel should be preached and this is what uh Jesus told us to do is preach the gospel and we know brother Brandon would and say it's more than just talking but it is a demonstration of the Gospel it is it is dist uh uh demonstration of power uh uh and and so then then we want that power how many wants that power we want to demonstrate that power well the secret to that power is humility uh is humility and and so uh um brother Braham said if if you want Power then see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you have been able to conquer yourself amen so humility comes by a man conquering himself can you say amen amen and and Conquer yourself and commit commit yourself to Christ seed to humble yourself before him that's really power and he goes on show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogancy but a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes is humility humbling ourselves before God and letting God just work through US ain't that right amen now humility is not uh uh uh having the complexes you know well I I just you know I just really can't do that and I just you know oh woe is me and and you know that that's not humility at all uh uh but but humility is acknowledging God Amen in all of our ways ain't that right I find a lot of people don't praise because of hum they they lack that real humility Amen to to Really acknowledge God in all their ways and and so uh but God respects humility the prophet said another place he said he dwells in humility another place God humbly glows in hum humility of the believer no matter how ignorant he is amen so uh uh it it it it doesn't take ignorance it takes humility ain't that right and and so uh if it's if it's genuine humility and the true humility then it will always cause a man to seek to please God in everything because that's that's what it is humility acknowledges God and and so uh uh now we know that God died um um Christ died to um to redeem uh mankind to redeem that that elect and and uh that he might have the complete preeminence in the church to express himself through through US ain't that right so God died amen that he could redeem us from the hands of of the enemy that he could take us out from the clutches so we don't have to be a puppet to the devil that we don't have to be a slave to the devil that God himself could have complete preeminence in the church ain't that right now God has not called us to to to fight with him and and to struggle with him and well I'm going to do it my way and you do it your way and and all that I don't believe that's where the church stands today I I believe that God has got a church that he can actually have total preeminence in amen I just I just believe that and and I think that's the desire of the Church of the Living God is that God it's not my will but it's thine be done and how many believes that amen our our desire is for that but but we find that if humility isn't there then then the the thing that takes its place is pride it's it's a it's it's either a display of real humility or or or pride is is in in uh being displayed amen my uh ear things went off I don't know if y was messing with it but uh uh or maybe the battery went out but uh uh so we we find that this is what caused um uh the the uh what happened in the garden or or in in heaven was that Lucifer had set out to establish his own kingdom ain't that right amen set out to establish a throne for himself and we've read this uh before but Isaiah 14 and and 12 it says uh uh how art thou Fallen uh oh uh from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning and how did thou uh art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God and I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north and I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high so there's nothing in consideration of anyone else he's not considering God not glorifying God not not seeking to please God it it was all about himself and and so uh then we we know that it was Pride that caused him to rebel and it it was Pride that caused him to become uh jealous it was Pride that caused him to cease from glorifying God and looking upon himself wanting a better better Kingdom realizing in himself that he can make a better Kingdom and and and it was all self- glory it was all self-exaltation he had literally exalted himself in his heart above God thinking that he was better than God and that he could have a better way than what God could have and so uh uh then but if you look at at Lucifer's position in heaven it was uh it was quite a position that he had uh uh for uh you know uh the prophet said he was God's right-hand man uh so so it wasn't like that he needed something to do uh it wasn't like that he needed to to to make something for himself God had already made it and he gave him the most prestigious position the greatest position above all Angels Above anything else and and the prophet said that God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a coworker part ly equal with God only Satan could not create so so Satan was up there next to God at his rightand man he he was above everything else and and the only thing he could not do was create amen so what a position that would have been but he wasn't satisfied with that position he wanted to do something different and pride actually got him and deceived in thinking he could come up with something better than God but who can come up with anything better than God what position and and and you think of this if if God has given you a position you could do nothing better in any other position than what God has called you to be if God has made you some certain way given you a certain personality a certain gift a certain a certain thing to work with God you can never come up with anything better for yourself than what God has already given you that's right can you say Amen well that's the way with Satan but he got puffed in up in his heart and he wanted something better and he actually thought he could come up with something better and so brother Brown said now see isn't that just the way people get today let God just bless a fell and put a little confidence in him and he gets to be a know- it all he gets to be and then he starts an organization he's got to do something that's different ain't that right and and and you know I've been listening to quite a bit to uh uh several sermons uh but brother brandham had preached the influence of another and and then he just titled it influence and I think he preached it four or five times and and uh you ought to go and listen to them I uh they really spoke to me but uh uh King Uzziah you know uh and and if you want to read about him in the Bible and God really blessed that man uh with with with such a kingdom and he started out very humble he started out acknowledging God he's he was he was trained he was raised up with Godly Parents and and uh he he he wanted to be right he he sought God and therefore God blessed his humility God blessed his his kingdom to where he was he was next to Solomon uh in in in the glory and and and things like that and and so but but through all the things that that God blessed Uzziah with somewhere he he got lifted up in his heart the Bible says and and he he started it it was all getting to his head like man I've really I've really done something here you know and and he he before you know it we find in his end that he tried to take another man's place he tried to take uh the place of the ministry and and so he went in there going to offer up the sacrifices and and just do his little thing and and uh uh then when the when the ministers came and told him says King you can't do that that's not your calling uh I've got my we got our calling and you got your calling but then he got wroth right he got all upset and before you know it he he was fulled with Leprosy and and uh uh and and that's the way he died was uh uh by leprosy he died a disgrace amen because of uh the what he had done but see he wasn't satisfied and the prophet said as as a king God blessed him uh uh he became a blessing to the people as king uh uh he was a blessing and and but when he tried to take The Minister's Place notice the prophet said he became a curse to the people and I thought that that how how that speaks to all of us here that God has got a place God has got a position for us and it it it doesn't matter what it is but as long as we abide in that place God will bless us and we are a blessing to others but when we come out of that place and we try to do something that God has not called us to do then we become a curse to others can you say amen now the prophet said God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something he said a man that God can bless and he'll still still keep himself a man and not be an angel or a god see as soon as man uh as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a god he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person see what what you know what I do it's me and me and mine and and all that see that's the wrong attitude God's hunting somebody who he can bless and pour out the blessings and more he bless the little the man will become ain't that right he said and you'll never get more of God until you become nothing so so we're not out to become something don't don't try to be something try to become nothing and and that's not belittling yourself in in the point that you uh uh you you have all of these complexes and and there there's a lot of people that just have low uh self-esteem that's really not humility amen we've got to know that we're children of of God we've got to know that the we do have power within us we we are the royal Seed of Abraham we are Sons and Daughters can you say man so humility is not belittling yourself there there's a lot of uh young people that that don't have a lot of uh s Satan really works especially with youth um uh because they're kind of in no man's land and they ain't really got their uh uh uh really established in themselves and so they're looking for acceptance they're they're they're looking for approval and and this is why we we call it peer pressure you don't you don't find adults getting in peer pressure it's usually young people that that that gives into peer pressure and because they want to be identified with something and maybe they've got low self-esteem and they don't feel like they're anything and they they they just they feel so out of place and they just you know and that's where Satan really talks to to a lot of our young people uh uh they'll go off into drugs they'll go off that because they really have nothing no standards they don't really believe in themselves you understand what I'm saying girls will take just any old God because they don't just they just don't believe in themselves that they deserve better than that or or even guys will do that you you understand what I'm saying I think we ought to build uh self-esteem in our children tell them how important they are tell them how nice they look tell them uh uh how how of a man they are or a woman they are becoming and and and really really build them up uh not to where it's a prideful not a a a false conception amen sure our children got a lot of faults but but if if we don't just keep uh hammering them on their faults and and really remind them just how special they really are can you say Amen but then there is a humility uh that that we all have to have and that again that's not belittling that's uh ourselves and and and uh not having uh you know just self-esteem and and all of that just trashing ourselves and all that I I don't believe that's that's it at all I but I do believe that we've got to come to the reality that we are nothing without God Amen can you say Amen we're nothing without God and and and so you true humility is one that would acknowledge God see and so uh uh we we find he says you've got to get uh uh little before you can get big you'll never be big in your own self how many believes that you'll never be big oh but I Got Talent you'll never be anything on yourself oh but I can really sing and everybody really likes it you'll never be nothing on yourself you you can sing like an angel but if God's not in it it means nothing you you can play like moven or or whoever you know but if God's not in it it means nothing can you say Amen so so then we find that you've got to get little before you can get big and you'll never be big in yourself you'll only be big as God will be big in you so how many knows we need him we need him it doesn't matter who we are it doesn't matter what we need him notice what brother Bram said about his own Ministry he said God has given me a gift that I might maybe do something else he said see it's it's and he's talking about how the difference between his ministry and just ministers and he he talking about the ministers how they get up and preach and they whatever he said but God's given me a gift that I I might maybe do something else it it's a gift of being a Seer or a prophet and or whatever you want to call it servant with a Divine gift that come on when I was a baby about 3 or 4 minutes old when mom opened up a little wooden window and here it came in see now he says see I had nothing to do with it it's God's love right now notice what he says if IID had had my choice of my Ministry it certainly wouldn't have been this now you think of that so brother Brown saying if I had the choice to choose what I wanted to be I wouldn't be this what what I am now but God made him that way amen and God has made every one of us the way we are God's G given us something to do amen ain't that right see so he says see it would have been something else I'd like to have being like Mr Baxter a preacher uh uh but this is what God wants me to do and I'm happy everybody say I'm happy I'm happy to do it for him because he's allotted me this to do to pray for his sick people now ministers don't get the criticism and things that we do on this see it's not cross it's not the thing that wearies you through the night and burden of people and so forth your faith don't have to go and challenge such as it does here see so it' been much popular and nicer if I could have just been a minister and had great big church somewhere and preach the gospel but it wasn't my lot ain't that right am so so uh uh brother brandham just kind of letting us know uh a little bit in his heart amen uh but yet now now see uh uh Lucifer uh uh God had given him his position but he he wasn't satisfied but notice he used his influence he used his influence in heaven to divide amen he used his influence to to take his followers away from God can you say amen amen that's what Pride does see and so he calls 2/3 of the angel to leave their place and to follow him you know it's it's interesting um uh as as we we know that the lid of hell has been lifted brother Brown said demons are pouring in everywhere it's it's conquering Nations and homes and churches it's conquering people it's everything and and and have you notice what it's causing people to do forsake the paths of righteousness can you say Amen that's right see and and people are now becoming lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God they're they're exalting Humanity more than God himself they're exalting their own cre their own uh bylaws their own ways their own dogmas amen their own teachings and and all of that instead of just uh humbling themselves but it's the spirit that they are anointed with can you say Amen the same spirit amen that CS that division in heaven is the same spirit in the day that we're living in amen the devil could not pour himself Out Among the people and anoint the people without that characteristics being displayed in the people that's right ain't that right so this has to do with the influence that they're under but if you notice that Lucifer he he didn't care about what happened to the other angels that followed him he didn't care that that he would cause them to to leave their own estate he didn't care about even the woman in the garden amen uh there she had perfect Fellowship her and her husband fellowship with God but he didn't care about that he didn't care that he would break that peace away and that Fellowship from God and he didn't care that that of what would happen to mankind when Adam fell he didn't care about any of them things can you say amen he doesn't care about Humanity being ruined and broken and devastated amen that's what Pride does doesn't care about the millions that are being deceived in this age and by his own trickeries and lies all he wants is his own own kingdom you believe that all he wants is his own kingdom it it amazes me how that God would would would would so vindicate the The Prophet's message even having his picture taken with that man and yet there will be ministers arise and try to diminish that and and and say well it's this and it's that yeah all it is to me is a spirit that started in the beginning to take away our faith to to take away our worship to take away our confidence in the god that confirmed this message amen according to 2 Thessalonians 2 and 3 we all know it but says he opposeth talking of Satan opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worship so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God and that right so Satan through his pride he will deceive Millions just to achieve his goal and this is what's happening and and and pride is is what caused him to do this and according uh to 1 Corinthians 11:14 Satan transforms himself into an angel of Light and his ministers are transformed as Ministers of righteousness so he's religious as can be and has a Ministry ain't that right but but but the heart of it all is pride pride is at the the core of that Ministry amen and and so we know that Satan can impersonate any gift that God's got he can preach the gospel he can perform the Miracles he can prophesy speak with tongues of men and angels dream dreams operate in the Supernatural realm amen and because remember they said Lord Lord have we not cast out Devils have we not prophesied have we not all these things right amen he can sing testify play music hold an office in the the church be a part of the five-fold ministry he can even display the fruits of the spirit Amen brother Bram said if you want to just go by the fruits of the spirit compare Jesus with the priest and you'll find that the priest actually showed more amen especially on that day when he whipped them when he whipped them uh out of the temple can you say amen amen see there there but but one thing he cannot do he cannot the prophet said bring that word word by word that's God can you say Amen amen that that's the thing that God sets his church on that's that's what he sets his a kingdom on Amen is the word of God and Satan cannot bring that word word by word he'll bring most of it but he won't he won't bring it all the way through and that's the deception so you can have any of the gifts of God without having God the prophet said and God is love amen ain't that right so then what we see in the ministry of Christ is humility amen again people think that U humility is is like being a pushover one who agrees with everything you say and can't stand on his own convictions and and um and and they call that humility but brother BR said that's not true he said Jesus was the humblest man that ever walked on the Earth but he wasn't so humble that he could bring correction he said and you you can be too humble see you can get so humble until the devil will you make a puppet out of you ain't that right he said he was humble and to washing the disciples feet he was forgiving enough to pray for those who drove spikes into his hands amen but when he saw wrong going on in the church he was man enough to Plate ropes and to run the money changers out of the house ain't that right another place Jesus loved the people he even gave his life there for those Pharisees that were crucifying him and he prayed for their forgiveness but yet he said you Generation of Vipers Snakes in the Grass and so forth like that see he wasn't exactly talking to the being that human being it was a spirit that he was talking to he said just look at Peter coming behind him said Lord you can't do that see and he turned around says get thee behind me Satan Thou Art always an offense to me well he wasn't speaking to Peter see he wasn't speaking to that he was the Fountain of Truth and it was a spirit that was on that apostle that was making him say that hello see he wasn't speaking to Peter he loved him he loved him and know he was to be the head of the church at Jerusalem he wasn't going to speak back to Peter he was speaking to the spirit that was causing Peter to hinder The Works of God yes amazing how Spirits get on people and then then they think oh you're correcting me it's not that it's the spirit it's the spirit that's trying to bring division it's the spirit that is trying to work sometimes it's a spirit that tries to get us to think that we're nothing it's a spirit that gets people disgruntled gets unsat dissatisfied right thinking I need to go do something else no just stay in your position amen can you say Amen we got a Ministry Lord so Jesus wasn't so humble that Satan would make a a puppet out of him but he was humble to where he would do nothing but the father's will can you say amen and not his own John 5:30 Jesus said I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which sent me amen John 6:38 for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me can you say Amen so see his ministry was a true Ministry because it wasn't founded upon Pride amen this is why Jesus prayed often that's right he was a man of prayer he prayed often why because he knew that it wasn't him he needed an auctioning amen the Lord hello so brother Bram says he prayed to the God that was within him amenallah what's the display of real humility how how he was God and and none other than God in human flesh and and God showing how how the humility because God is the author of humility I believe and he comes in a human body not seeking recognition right amen not seeking Glory right he comes in a way that he hides himself right he didn't come to have his name among the Great Men of the earth he didn't come in a display of arrogancy and pride but came in humility and in weakness right it he come the Bible says he spoke a Common Language among Common People amen right so he didn't speak the language of dignitaries and theologians he didn't come as a rich man flaunting his wealth he had no home he had no place to lay his head the prophet said at his birth he had to borrow a Manger right at his death he had a borrow a grave ain't that right and yet he was God he was so humble and meek that the people didn't recognize him as God that's right they crucified him for saying he was God Amen right yes sir see and and and so uh uh and the people that did recognize him as God it took a revelation amen Jesus even told him who do men say that I the son of man am and and some of them repeating everybody else what they said and some say you're a prophet and some say you're this some but who do you say that I am and and Peter stood up there Christ the son of the Living God right took him all the way past Abraham even all the way to the beginning Jesus said Flesh and Blood could not reveal this to you Peter it was my Father which is in heaven hath revealed it took a revelation ain't that right see and so that was the only way that that the people could recognize him amen but he displayed the attributes and the character istics of God he manifested the power of God and yet he did not make a reputation for himself he didn't do what he did to have a following right if he was doing it for that reason he he probably would have compromised on his teachings CU remember he said except you eat the Flesh of the and drink the blood blood or or drink the blood and eat the Flesh of the son of man you have no life in you and because of that saying they walked away from him saying this is a hard saying brother BR said they were thinking he was a vampire how we going to eat him but did he change it no brother Ram said he actually said it to weed down his crowd so he wasn't after a following right right see and and and and so then then he turns around after they they leave him and he looks at his disciples and he gives them the opportunity to leave as well see if he was after a falling he wouldn't have even given them the opportunity to leave because that's not the way men do who are trying to build a kingdom unto themselves I thought brother Brahman said in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word just as we showed you that Antichrist means anti- so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends and have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear they say if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow see they are false prophets for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ he won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says can you say Amen see so so we find that that it it it takes a real humility that uh uh for Ministry because God wants to use us he he he wants to reflect his power through US amen but but he's got to have a people that don't get puffed up amen you got to have a people that don't get it in their heads that you know what we're the one that's making this thing Run come on you got to have a h have a people that that knows how to wait upon him and say God you use me any time you know we're not wasting our time just waiting on the Lord I think more people are wasting their time by not waiting on the Lord amen prophesying when the Lord doesn't prophesy doing things that the Lord hadn't done and why they're doing all of this and God's not saying anything right that's the waste of time yeah that's right you love the Lord I think a lot of times we don't see a lot of things you know now in Pentecost there was prophecies going forth almost every service always someone having a dream always someone in Visions always someone prophesying always coming to the message you don't see that a lot right now you know I believe that all of that is right I believe in gifts but I think the reason why it's slowed down is because there is a people that actually are learning to wait cuz a lot was being spoke that God ain't spoke a lot of things was being done in the name of the Lord that it was not God hate to say it but it's just the truth we went by emotion it was going by feelings it was going by unctions or or impression the prophet would call that impression hello amen see in other words getting ahead of God doing something that God wasn't in doing something saying something that God wasn't saying that's exactly what the devil was able to do hello get a church that was acting outside of God's will but we've got a a people by the message of The Hour That is learning just to Simply humble themselves and wait am God gave the gift so that he can use that gift God gave the talent so he could use that Talent right amen don't do it for vain glory amen whatever God gives you to do it's needed only if God is in it if God is using it that's what we want right that's that's what we want see so we we find brother Brown says I do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by the denomination they belong to or by the group that they are assembled with whether they be Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or Pentecost or whatever they are we should never judge the men by the denomination that he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has see whether is latter rain former rain inner outer rain or no rain whatever it might be we should never judge him by that but by his Spirit everybody say by his Spirit see we are to discern Spirits watch what the man has in mind watch what he's trying to achieve if the man by a gift no matter how great that gift is can you say Amen now if you look in in Ephesians 4:7 and I'll get ready to close but to every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ can you sayen that whatever God has given you to do there's Grace for that try to do it outside of that there's no Grace you'll fail there's a lot of people try to be like brother brandham yeah and they and they had had nervous breakdowns oh wow even in in brother bram's day they they they were falling apart no man could ever do what brother brandom done it was Grace upon that man ain't that right and thank the Lord he didn't get exalted above it when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts everybody say gave gifts unto men there are men who have the ability to preach and to teach there are people that have the the gift of of to to play music to sing some have the gift to be officers in the church whether it be Deacon trustee or Treasurer or even even Sunday School teacher not everybody can be a Sunday school teacher take someone with the gift to be able to get down to their level and and bring the Simplicity of the Gospel can you say Amen but God has given gifts to to to his body to uh to where you know that that people can actually be what Paul called to be and that is helps in the church amen now notice of all gifts I I don't care how small it may seem or or how big it may be that for one there's no great ones Among Us not in the body that's right but the reason the prophet said for God giving gifts is to Magnify Him Lord not magnify us but to Magnify Him and to unify the people PA well what are we going to unify them around us no unify them around the word of God can you say Amen to bring the body together and to help us to unite our efforts and our prayers see so these gifts that are given to us are for to work for him work for him how many wants to work for our Lord man I want to work for our Lord I don't want to work for Shawn Martin cuz we fail right I want to work for him you can never be a failure when you're working for him ain't that right that's right so so God knew we were going to need his gifts brother BR said he gave us the gift of the Holy Ghost because we were going to need it he gave us the gift of Divine Healing he said now you know should we practice Divine Healing when we got the best doctors in the world God Gave You Divine Healing cuz he knows you have to use it he gave you the gifts of the Spirit ain't that right another place said they tried to tell us that years ago that there was no such thing as speaking with tongues and prophecy and all these great gifts that God promised in the early church and gave to them them days have passed he said you think that stopped that hungry-heart people they took a hold of this word and know that the Bible said the promises unto you and to your children and to them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and they stayed on their knees and cried and begged and kipped up their heels and screamed until God poured out the same Holy Ghost upon them that he did uh uh on them at the beginning we have them trying to take Gifts of Pastor Prophet evangelist teacher the fivefold ministry the Min missionary out of the church God's never done that he placed them gifts in the church amen hallelujah he also gave the to the church nine spiritual gifts you see without these things we have no Ministry amen you might as well pass Donuts around or something but we have the nine spiritual gifts wisdom knowledge speaking in tongues Gifts of healing interpretation of tongues and so forth nine spiritual gifts all everybody say all to show his love towards the church that he wants you to stay in order it's not so well oh that guy's a prophet man he can prophesy and he's all the time prophesy wow that's cool that's nothing to do with that man that's a gift that God will use for our benefit for the benefit of the church can you say Amen see the great he says he want that he wants you to stay in order see the great Holy Spirit himself being the tutor of the church another place these gifts are given to edify everybody say to edify or to keep together now do you understand why Paul would tell us that no prophesying without an interpreter right on amen he said if everybody would speak in tongues and there was someone that was ignorant of all this stuff that look and think you all mad why it's not for our edification that's right we've got a Ministry brother BR say well they they you say well I just can't hold it yes you can hold it you can amen so he said these gifts are to edify or to keep together not to not to divide not to bring confusion that's right amen and to melt together the one big body of the Lord another place he set set gifts in his church to bring his church together to keep it coordinated to work for the good of his church another place nine spir different spiritual gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean hello notice how these gifts to bring it he said just like ananas and safaris and so forth the spirit of God rise up and call somebody else and tell them they're living wrong and rebuke that sin openly that's what the holy spirit is in the church for to keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the Lord right praise the Lord and the Holy Spirit is to operate these gifts can you say Amen now church I truly believe that there is a people that are humble yes sir to where God can have preeminence that these gifts can operate right the Lord because really it's not for us to serve ourselves even in speaking in tongues he said you Paul said you pray in the secret and you speak in tongues that's edifying yourself you're speaking that before God hello Amen brother brah says the same thing over and over and over but it takes humility because CU it's it's the humble person that seeks to to do only the will of the father and the only do as the father shows them and and and I know that that bride this people is upon the Earth and I believe that we're here in this there there part of that is in this assembly tonight where the Prophet said the word is in the bride they do only his will they have thus said the Lord that they keep silent yall know the quote now the prophet said the Holy Spirit freely sets these gifts in the church and they perfectly everybody say perfectly operate if you just won't get excited and try to take what you think yourself that's where people make mistakes and I find that among the people that somebody gets all influenced and kind of hepped up a little by the Holy Spirit see which it's wonderful stimulated but there's someone will come to you and say does the Lord say so and so and you don't have to give them that answer you don't have to give them an answer can you say amen that's right don't you say it unless God says it then you've got thus sayi the Lord then nothing can keep it from happening it's just got to happen he said I'd take anybody to church tonight you've never heard the Holy Spirit speak in the meetings of thus sayth the Lord but what had happened exactly that way exactly out of the millions of cases it's absolutely has to be right ain't that right if the Holy Spirit would come and say to me by Vision I want you to go to the presidential graveyard tomorrow I'm going to bring up George Wasington he said I'd invite the whole world to come and see it done it it could have it could have to happen for the Holy Ghost said so that makes it the truth but until he says that you just wait you know you're saved you know you're filled with his goodness you know see how if he is in you he'll act his life out in you so just be satisfied can you say that with me be satisfied satisfi just be satisfied he wants to use you sure he'll sure do it he knows where you're at amen can you say Amen Lord you love the Lord amen see it's not for Vang Glory what what Ministry it's you know brother R he would say in this place he says I'm here tonight to try to help you to have a solid faith in Jesus Christ by the gift of the Divine a gift coming from God which was given to me allotted by grace of the Lord to manifest Jesus Christ to you in his love that's why I'm here tonight is to help you to believe on him I think that's what every gift ought to do every one of us true is we're here to get the people to believe we're here to get the sinner to [Music] believe you believe that well then if we're going to watch what we do in the church we got to watch what we do outside the church amen be the example the example of a real believer that's right amen you love him am amen if the musicians will come today most people judge Men by the gift he has and they are god-given gifts but the prophet says but if we do not use them in the right way that God intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have the gifts amen ain't that right yeah we could do more harm with the gift than we could without the gift think about he said I would rather see Brotherly Love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else we must know what these things are for amen can you say amen amen you love the Lord may God help us [Music] not to serve or not to operate for vain Glory but help us to be conscience of our littleness right of our need for him for Jesus says without me you can do nothing yes and what does that mean what what what does that put us in it puts us in desperation God not my will but thy will be done should cause us to pray it should cause us to keep our spirit quietened it should cause us to think twice before we act before we speak before we respond God let me respond with Grace let me respond the way you would want me to respond let let me react the way you would want me to react oh God I need you how many knows you need him I I need you Lord I need you amen
