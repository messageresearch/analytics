Oh, I may worry, hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, the children had their backs to that red sea. And oh Pharaoh, it looked like he had the victory, but the waters rolled on back with the breath you blew. And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh yes. Joshua took a walk around Jericho. Lord, you told him, you told him that the wall would go. Oh, and it crumbled at the shout when the trumpets blew. And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. I may falter, stumble in everything I do. Oh, I may worry and hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. I may fall stumbling. [Music] It ain't nothing for you. Sing it again. It ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. I may falter, stumble in everything I do. I may worry, hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Well, do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing too hard for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's certainly worthy of our love. And tell you, person that gets to know him, you just can't help but just fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; And um it just gets greater and greater as the day goes by. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we love the Lord and certainly good to uh be here with you and see everyone and uh good to have Sister Kim's granddaughters. Amen. God bless you all. And uh the musicians can be dismissed. Praise the Lord. And if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to the book of Mark, the 7th chapter. And um we want to, as it's been said, want to keep um uh Sister Lisa's daughter Rebecca in our prayer and um just having different things going on, uh in her body. And so, um, was able to talk with her today a little bit and and, um, just praying that the Lord is working on her behalf and just love to see her come to church and just surrender her heart to the Lord and um, uh, just had a good talk today. And so, we're just uh, asking for her for prayer for her, not only physically, but spiritually. Amen. Before we go into the word, let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord. Amen. We certainly need him in this hour. Father, Lord, it's something in our heart that cries out that there's nothing nothing too hard, nothing too difficult for you, Lord. Your arm isn't short, Lord, to where it cannot save. It cannot deliver. But God, you you can reach way down below the bottom for you did it for me. And we're so thankful, Lord. And we're just asking that you would move this evening and have your way. Father, speak to every heart, Lord, for your word. Your word is important to us. And father, help us to receive of it. And may you just bless the the ministering of your word as well as the hearing. Just help me to get myself out of the way and yield myself to you, Father, we pray. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. So we want to look at uh Mark the uh 7th chapter and um we'd read this I believe last Wednesday but I want to read it again the 25th verse. For a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet. The woman was a Greek, a sir sir Phoenician by nation, and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. Now we know he had the power to do that, right? &gt;&gt; But Jesus said unto her, "Let the children first be filled, for it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it unto the dogs." And she said, she answered and said unto him, "Yes, Lord, or truth, Lord." Yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. And he said unto her, "For this thing, go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter." &gt;&gt; Amen. And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. You can have your seats this evening. And I guess if I were to title uh this would be cherishing the word that you have received. And um this came to me the other day. Um uh this quote was posted on the minister's chat and um it's uh brother Brandham says now we are supposed to be Abraham's seed. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not just a Christian but you're identified in the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every true elect of God is identified in the Bible as Abraham's seed. So Abraham's seed still lives today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, "Now we're supposed to be Abraham's seed spiritually speaking, being in Christ." Notice, we should take a hold of every promise of God &gt;&gt; and cherish it &gt;&gt; as though it was already done. &gt;&gt; For when God has spoken, he can never, everybody say, he can never &gt;&gt; take it back. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, as the seed of Abraham, we are to take a hold of every promise of God and cherish it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As though it is already done. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, I looked up this word cherish. It means to hold dear, feel, or show affection for. So, uh uh this is what brother Bram is saying about cherishing the promises of God to hold them dear &gt;&gt; to have a feeling for and affection for &gt;&gt; to entertain &gt;&gt; to harbor in the mind deeply and resolutely. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So now we are to cherish it. You cherish something because you value it. Uh uh the word of God is a treasure to the believer. Uh God gave us his word because he treasures it &gt;&gt; and he expects us to treasure it just as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and so it's it's invaluable. The word of God. I can't I can't explain that enough. We can't tell it enough. This word of God is invaluable. And to the to the unbeliever, it has no value at all. To the unconverted man, he sees no value to it. It's just a book of rules, dos and don'ts. It's just a code of ethics. Um a book of morals. Um uh some have uh you know I I believe I've uh stated you know that men have studied this Bible and actually have become wealthy by the principles of it. &gt;&gt; Um doctors have have uh learned many things in the medical field just simply uh studying this Bible. Dieticians &gt;&gt; uh have become effective by just studying the principles of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Military men have have studied the Bible of of wars and things like that and have by their study uh and applying the principles have actually won wars simply of of their study of the Bible. Th this Bible is is is is one of the greatest um uh is the greatest uh holds the greatest information that a man could have is the Bible. Ain't that right? But but we also find that because men have not considered the Bible to be much uh they have misjudged uh things by not looking at what God uh God's word said about it. U nations have done the same thing. uh you know uh uh the brother Bram would talk about it how about you know there were valuable things and places that were at one time considered to be insignificant are now seen as something valuable like the Dead Sea. It was at one time considered to be waste and no value in it at all. But they have now figured and and discovered that the Dead Sea holds more wealth than anything in the world. It's it's the Dead Sea. And so uh England uh once was in possession of of some land in the Middle East. Uh that land was barren. It was dry, rocky, desert. uh just to them it was just wasteland but they owned it and because they saw no value in it they they gave it away to the Arabs and and so brother Brandham said see they didn't see what the Bible had to say about it &gt;&gt; see if they would have studied the Bible if they would have seen what the Bible said about it they would have held it as valuable &gt;&gt; uh and so the Bible Ible says that that land would would blossom like a rose and would bring forth her abundance. Brother Bradom said England even made a vital mistake by giving back India her rights. See, so they don't realize um uh these things because they don't re read the Bible. They don't they don't study the Bible. The they they only study maybe what they want and what they're after. And but but the whole Bible is full of information and and it's it's uh brother Bram says now if if that be true amongst nations where they they they uh see no value in things because they don't study the Bible uh and see what the Bible has to say about things. Uh how much more is it amongst mankind tonight who do not value value their life day by day to read the Bible and see what God has laid in his word for every man. Ain't that right? See your your life is written in the Bible. Amen. And what God says about you and what God intends and and all of this thing. See, the only way you you'll misvalue about yourself as as nations misval uh uh uh well, like like I say, they they they didn't see the value of the Dead Sea for a long time. They didn't see the value in in the Holy Land and and all around them places. Well, you'll never see the value in yourself until you read the Bible to see what God says uh about you. Ain't that right? That's the only way to see value in yourself. and and uh is is to study God's word. Amen. See, well, you know what what what does the the Bible why is the Bible so valuable? What what does it have? Well, first of all, Jesus says, "Heaven and earth shall not pass away." Everybody say, "Heaven and earth shall not pass away, but my word will never pass away." Ain't that right? So, you know, uh, uh, Brother Bran was, uh, uh, quoting that, uh, the the the preacher, the the gentleman, uh, that said, "I would rather I would rather be standing on God's word than standing in heaven." And someone asked him, "Well, why is that? Why why wouldn't you want to stand in heaven?" He said, "Well, because heaven and earth going to pass away, but God's word will never pass away." So, he says, "I'm better off to stand on the word of God, knowing that it'll never fail." Ain't that right? And so every word in this Bible is going to come to pass. How many believes that? And now church, it's going to come to pass. It is coming to pass. It has come to pass. You you can study world history. You can study and and and and compare it with Bible prophecy and you can tell that this Bible is or has had everything has been conducted by the Bible. Can you say amen? Amen. So, uh uh then if if every word in the Bible is going to come to pass, then this makes every word of God a promise. It isn't God wishing it to happen. Uh God uh thinking about it and don't know or or God just saying a by word and let a word slip here and there and uh going to retract that. Every word is a promise. It will happen. It shall be. Amen. As he has said it. Do you believe that? Amen. Well, then if there is something hanging on to you and that this Bible has not ascribed to you, then that thing is temporal. Ain't that right? Amen. Anything that is is is hanging on to us that this Bible has not obscribed to us and has not imputed to us, then it's it's it's temporal. It's not here to stay. Ain't that right? For only God's promises are yay and amen. &gt;&gt; God's word is eternal. Do you believe that? So, there are things about us that are subject to change. And we all know this. Amen. Subject to change. Uh uh because um uh because there's things about the word of God that is not uh uh uh uh there's things about us that the word of God does not abscribe. I was bound for hell at one time, but that was subject to change because the word of God never ascribed that to me. That wasn't my destination. Ain't that right? See, I was a sinner, but that was subject to change because the word of God never imputed that to me. It never subscribed to me. So that that to me. So sickness is subject to change. Depression is subject to change. Anxiety is subject to change. You understand what I'm saying? Amen. uh um uh um um you know uh uh uh temper is subject to change. Drug addiction is subject to change because there's nothing in the word of God that imputes that to me. Amen. See, I have been predestinated to be conformed into the image of God's son. I have been predestinated unto the adoption of sons. I have been predestinated. Amen. To go in a rapture, to be Can you say amen? To partake of the marriage supper of the lamb and and to be in the millennium. And so what things that I started out with did not uh uh uh fit with the pattern of God's word. So them weren't God's promises to me. So they had to change in order to make God's word fit. That's right. to give way to God's word, to give room to God's word. Ain't that right? So then you find out, amen, uh uh uh what what the word says about you because it's the word of God that's going to prosper. It's the word of God that's going to accomplish that which God sent it to do. Ain't that right? So So we find that the word started out in the beginning as a thought of God. Amen. And and then God expressed his thought by speaking it. And the thought became a word. See, and and and so you cannot say a word uh uh without it being in the your mind. Amen. And and it becomes a thought. Amen. And and then it becomes a word. But God's word is premeditated thoughts. There's words that you might just say off the cuff and and it just enters and and you say it unconsciously, but yet it had to be a thought first. But then there are are thoughts that you premeditate. You you think about and you you fred over or or uh uh you're happy about and but you're meditating on these thoughts and before long they develop in words. Ain't that right? Amen. See, and so God thought it. Amen. And then he expressed his word by speaking it. And that thought became a a word. Ain't that right? So the word that that God spoke in the beginning, Amen. is no different than uh what true prophets speak. Prophets do not speak anything than what God has already spoken. Amen. for the prophet said God has let them prophets see foresee what God spoke in the beginning. Amen. See, they they uh uh they're only catching the the thoughts of God, the word of God, uh uh that he had spoke in the beginning. For in the beginning, God knew everything that would ever be from the very first beginning. Ain't that right? So then it shows that God is of one mind. Amen. Whether he it was him alone with his thoughts and then he expressed the word or whether it's him coming down in in the prophets and anointing them to speak the word. Amen. He's still speaking the same thing. What he spoke in the beginning, he's still speaking today. Can you say amen? He's always spoke. So he has never changed his mind. He's never changing and progressing and and all of these things and and and and changing his plan. He's of one mind. And so it proves that the word of God is eternal. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God's word will never change because God cannot change. Ain't that right? So then we find Brother Brandon would say this. Amen. You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You are perfect. Well, how did he get that? He picked it up. God had already spoke you and and spoke your and said you're perfect before the foundation of the world. And a prophet wasn't just some saying something new about you. He was just picking up what God said about you. Amen. and declaring it to you again and showing that no matter how steeped in sin you were and how scarred you are, it never changed God's thoughts about you, it never changed God's word about you. Can you say amen? Amen. God ain't just seeing you as a sinner. And then for the first time, Amen. since you come to him and and you gave your heart to him, now he's seeing you as virtuous, sinless bride. No, he's always saw you as the sinless, virtuous bride. Amen. It's an eternal word. Can you say amen? So this today is not a progression of word for you. It's just it's on forever. Oh Lord, the psalmist said, "Thy word is settled in heaven." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and so he the prophet was only saying what God had already said at the beginning. Notice another place he says, "You're standing completely. You never sinned at the first place." God don't even know. God don't even know. It's in the sea of forgetfulness. You never did it. You were accused of it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Your your accuser, Satan, was trying to uh uh put your sins and get God to dwell on your sins and get God to look at you as a sinner, as a hopeless case, as a as a a a basket case. But he could never do it. Amen. And God would send a prophet in this age. Amen. And catch him up in the rim of the spiritual realm to catch what he has already spoke about you. You are standing completely. You never sinned in the first place. God don't even know. It's in the sea of forgetfulness. You never did it. &gt;&gt; You were accused of it by the accuser. But really from the beginning, you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God. understanding their wars and your old book of divorcement is put away. It's dead. Absolutely out of existence. Even in the mind of God, you're the virtuous bride of Christ, washed in the blood of Christ, precious, virtuous, sinless son of uh son of God, standing with the pure, unadulterated word, bride, that he washed by the water of his own blood and became flesh and manifested, that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was. Can you say amen? The word of God is eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "And anything that God says is a signed document." &gt;&gt; I think that's pretty good. &gt;&gt; Anything that God says, it's a signed document. &gt;&gt; There's no arguing about it. &gt;&gt; There's no debate about it. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now if you notice what he says everything that God is worth &gt;&gt; how many sees value in him &gt;&gt; huh &gt;&gt; human dialect can't even even can't even begin &gt;&gt; to comprehend the value of God &gt;&gt; and here's the prophet saying everything that God is worth and everything that God is is behind Find that word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The value he says the words in this Bible will expel either life or death to us &gt;&gt; in this is a pardon &gt;&gt; for our sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To those who believe that they are forgiven of sin. &gt;&gt; How many believes you're forgiven of sin? &gt;&gt; Now, now church, if you're forgiven, don't wrestle with it no more. &gt;&gt; Don't wrestle with your past. Don't wrestle with your mistakes. Don't wrestle with what I should have done, could have done, ought to have done. All of these things. If you believe, amen, that your sins are forgiven, the wrestling is over. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's healing to those who can receive it as healing. &gt;&gt; It's salvation to those who who can receive it as salvation. It's deliverance to those who will receive it in that way. Brother Bram says, "The promise of the Holy Ghost is an assurance to you that you'll get it if you receive it that way." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It's a promise. Healing is a promise. Salvation is a promise. Deliverance is a promise. The Holy Ghost is a promise. It's a promise. Amen. He promised it to guarantee you that you will get it if you'll receive it at that way. I'm not receiving as an opinion of God's. I'm not receiving healing as just some wish of God's. It's a promise and I receive it that way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that any man has to be tormented and bound by the devil. &gt;&gt; I I get it. We go through trials, but you don't have to be tormented and bound by the devil. &gt;&gt; We go through things, but you don't have to be tormented. Amen. And bound. See, a person can have peace if they will just accept it as their peace. A person can have joy if they would just accept it as their joy. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; See now, but the word of God will only be good to you if you'll just receive it in that way. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Every promise of God is at your uh disposal. I think that's right. It's at your fingertips. It's it's yours. It's in your grasp if you'll receive it that way. every promise. Can you say amen? Amen. That's right. See, so therefore, it depends on a person's attitude toward the word of God. Now, Jesus tells us that his word is spirit and life. So, so it's not a dead letter. It's it's not as as though you would you would read uh some western book and and and and you know uh uh I like reading western and and and if he's a good writer you know he can he can take you in the back uh back in history and and before you know it your mind is drifting in the back you know back in the days gone by and and the roads are dusty and and the tumble weeds are rolling down the roads and and uh you know the old horse Betsy you know is getting along and there's cattle, thousands of cattle. I mean, if he paints the picture just right, amen, you find yourself in in there in the book and and you're seeing yourself in there. But it's only a book. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to bring that to you. Soon as you get out of that book and it says the end, you're back in electric cars and you're back into this and you're back into that. You're back with troubles and you're back with this and there ain't no guns right on your hip. Ain't no tumble weeds and and all of these things. See, but but see, it's it's a dead letter. It's just something that that it it begins and and just a few pages, then it ends. And then you got to go find you another book, maybe a a book about a lawyer, uh uh uh trying to win a case and and and you get wrapped up in that book if he's a good writer, you know, but but then we find out, but this book, amen, has no end because his word is spirit and they are life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This book fits with all generations. It fits for the for the eldest in this building and it fits for the youngest in this building. It fits for every trial that you're going through. It fits for you because his word is spirit and they are life. Ain't that right? So the prophet said, see the spirit lays in the word and life lays in the word. The spirit lays in the word and life lays in the word. So, Brother Brham says, "If you want a church, now listen. If you want a church, start with the word of God. If you want a life of God, start with the word of God. Accept the word in its fullness, every measure of it. And if that is the fullness of God in you, then the rain that's afallen will produce exactly what's in your garden." In other words, if the word of God is in you, you have received the word of God as a promise, then the rain that is fallen upon you is going to produce every promise that you have placed in your garden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We know that the word is a seed. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; As we've talked about it, you know it. The word is a seed. Therefore, it has to fall in the ground. That's been prepared beforehand. And uh sometimes uh Sister Kim during the Sunday school lessons will give uh the children a a seed, a mustard seed or a certain seed, you know, and they're excited. It's all in a bag, little bitty seeds, and they want to plant it. And then you start you plant it, you know, and then you you you bur it in that in the ground in that dirt and then you water it and then you start seeing product. You you start seeing some life come out of that dirt because the life was in the seed all along. &gt;&gt; There was something there. Quickening power was in that seed. Amen. It just needed to be buried in some dirt ground. Amen. for it to be transformed from seed to reality of what it truly is. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Well, the word of God is a seed that if it can be received, Amen. in the human heart, ain't that right? The seed has to fall into ground that's been prepared beforehand. The prophet said, Amen. in order for the seed to bring forth what it is. He said if you sowed seed, just throwed it out there on the ground, it would do no good. The birds would pick it up. You throw it among the thistles and thorns, it'll choke it out pretty soon. See? But now notice what Paul would say to the church. First Thessalonians 2 and 13. For this cause also uh uh thank we God without ceasing. Because when you received the word of God, which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which now now which effectively workketh in you also that believe. Can you say amen? It was working in Paul. And now Paul had a a a a bookload of seeds, amen, that he was distributing out by preaching the gospel. Amen. And there was some people there, amen, that was catching that seed. Amen. And they received it not as a Paul, but they received it as the word of God. Amen. And he says, "Now I see that you have received it. I see that you've accepted it because I see it working effectively in you. Now it's it's it's no longer just seeds of words, but it's becoming a reality. Can you say amen? Amen. That's what the word of God does to us. If you can receive it, Amen. and and receive it for what it is, the word of God, it'll effectively work in you. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brown says, "When really in your heart you accept the word of God, it becomes positive." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; When you accept the word of God in your heart, it becomes positive. No matter no matter what the rest of them is seeing, &gt;&gt; you're seeing it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Except the word of God and it becomes positive. Everybody else may be wrestling with it. Everybody else may not be seeing what the word is really saying, but you'll see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you've accepted it in your heart. &gt;&gt; Now he says, "Now, and Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Another place. Now Abraham wasn't afraid to put his to work. Are you? &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid to put his faith to work. &gt;&gt; Are you on? The same faith that he gave Abraham, he gives it to you freely. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say this. You can't have faith without God giving it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But listen, it all depends on our approach of the word. &gt;&gt; It all depends how valuable we see the word. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Because it's the word that gives the faith. Faith cometh by what? &gt;&gt; Hearing and hearing by the word. &gt;&gt; So we can say, "Oh God, give me faith. faith, faith, faith, faith. Oh, just give me faith, faith, faith. And then the promises are being uh preached and we're just, oh, well, I just don't know. I just ain't Oh, I just I just I I just don't see myself there. Well, you cannot accept the faith that is trying to give you. &gt;&gt; God gives us the faith through the the the the hearing of the word. &gt;&gt; Now, now, so uh uh so he freely gives to you if you use it. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. Abraham wasn't afraid to put his to work. Are you the same faith that he gave to Abraham, he freely gives it to you if you'll use it. Say, I have a gun. It'll shoot. It's a good shooting, you know, good, true shooting gun. I hang it up on the wall and I say, "Oh, yeah, sure. I got a gun." Well, what you going to do with it? Well, it hangs on the wall. Well, that's faith. People say, "Oh, I'm a Christian. I believe God can." But what do you do about it? Put it to work. Turn it loose. do something with it. Get out. Hunt and hunt up the devil where he says you still hurting. Say you're a liar. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Put your faith to work. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't let him just constantly tell you that you're defeated. Say something back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Don't let him tell you that it's all over. Say something back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Truth. So, put it to work. &gt;&gt; So, he says, you know, the devil tells you you're still hurting, say you're a liar. Pull a bead on him. Get him in the scope. Don't be afraid to pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Cuz it'll go off as sure as anything. Yes, sir. It'll boomerang on him. &gt;&gt; So, hold on. &gt;&gt; Abraham, like God, called those things which were not as though they were. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham done with his faith. &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with our faith? &gt;&gt; He let the devil talk negative into us. &gt;&gt; Well, your your marriage is going to fall apart. Oh, really? Oh, man. What do I need to do? I just don't know. Oh, your children are they'll never get saved. Oh, no. Really? I I'm I'm trying to do better and I'm just this I just don't know. You know, and before you know, we get so depressed and we're just moaning and a groaning. Oh, you're going to die, you know. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Look, I mean, your toes hurting. Oh, that'll get worse. You know that, don't you? Amen. Oh, gang green's going to set in. Before you know it, you're going to be turning green and then you're going to die. You know, you know, and and we allow him to just to talk. Well, sometimes we've got to use our faith and speak back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you know it's true. That's right. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find Abraham like God called those things which were not as though they were. Anything everybody say anything &gt;&gt; contrary to God's promise was a lie to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Feelings that he felt that were contrary to God's promise was a lie to him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Emotions that he felt that was a contrary to God's promise to him was a lie to him. &gt;&gt; You understand? See, anything contrary was a lie. See, and so now as as we know, brother Brandon preached the sermon, the greatest battle ever fought. And and he talks about it, you know, how that in the beginning, man has been the the the since the beginning, man has been the battleground. Amen. Battleground. It never changes and through all the ages, man is still the battleground. And and so uh uh where two opposing forces, they're great forces uh meet uh in the man in the human being and and they fight their battles. The one trying to conquer the other, one trying to overcome the other. Ain't that right? So in the in the in the garden, Brother Brown said that Satan chose man's mind, his intellects, his reasonings, his imaginations, and and and God chose man's heart. Amen. Now that the battle has been set. Amen. God says, "I'm going to win this. I'm I'm going to my word is going to conquer in this individual." And and Satan says, "Oh, no, it's not. No, sir. I'll defeat you." Amen. Bring it on and I'll defeat your word. Amen. And so they meet in in the human being. See? And so every battle that you're going through, it's not it's not you. It's God and Satan that is at war together. Can you say amen? They're opposing one another. Satan is putting thoughts in your mind and God is trying to put the word into your heart. A ain't that right? Now you become the battleground because you are a uh uh um uh free moral agent. You you you can choose. Amen. Just like the Bible says, God says, "Behold, I set before you Amen. uh uh uh uh life and death." Amen. And blessings and cursings and and so you you you you've got your choices now. Amen. See, and so we we find they war. Now, Brother Brandham says the church today and and the carnal church depends everything upon the intellect, never thinking of the heart. And the only thing that they can see, well, I just can't see it that way. And well, you don't see with your eyes anyhow. You look with your eyes, you see with your heart. You look at anything and say, "Well, I just don't see it." Well, you're looking at it, but you don't see it. It means you don't understand it. Your understanding comes from your heart. See, now here he is now. He doesn't understand it with his mind. He doesn't understand the word. He doesn't understand the promises of God with his mind. How is he going to do it? See, his intellect would tell him that that that's his reasonings. But the Bible says we cast down reasonings. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Cast them away from us. You see? And and so so so you say, "Well, how am I going to get well when the doctor says I'm I'm I I'm I'm going to die. H how am I going to get well when the doctor says they ain't got no cure for this and and and I'm just one out of a billion that's actually got it, you know, and I just don't know what to do or or how am I going to get well? I I've got the common disease and and and there's nobody in science of of that that uh uh uh that's ever uh recorded to overcome this sickness. They die with it and and it just always be there, you know. Well, the intellect begins to say, "Well, how am I going to do this? I I just don't know." And and and it can get so uh uh our reasonings can get so prominent that when we come to the church and the promises are being preached, we can't get past it. be we can't hear the promises. We can't accept the promises because we're going by reasoning. Oh, it becomes a mountain to us. And it and what started out to be just a little antill now becomes something so huge that we can't even see God as who he is. And and we lose value in the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So he says, "How am I going to get well when the doctor says this and when I've done this?" that don't have one thing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Well, see, that's letting the devil put them thoughts there. &gt;&gt; As as as we said before, the devil's good at putting thoughts in your mind and then making you feel like you're the one that thought them. Sure. &gt;&gt; Putting thoughts in your mind and then attaching it to you and you're like, "Oh my, if I was a Christian, how could I have ever thought that?" &gt;&gt; If if I was really strong in faith, how could I have ever even imagined that? &gt;&gt; Well, Satan's putting that into your intellect. &gt;&gt; He does. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So that's the devil putting them thoughts in there to get you to receive them and believe them. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; Now when you do that, it makes the word of God of no effect. &gt;&gt; Non-effective. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's true. So this is why we cannot dwell on both. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The negative and the positive. Negative and the positive. Negative and the positive. choose what to dwell on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is why the Bible says 2 Corinthians 10:5, casting down imaginations, &gt;&gt; reasonings. &gt;&gt; Every You say, "Well, what's reasoning? What's that? What what's he talking about?" Every thought that is contrary to this word, put it down. Cast it down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't dwell on it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, Paul is telling us one thing. You have the power to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person that's got the Holy Ghost has the power to do it. You don't have to have a positive um what what do they call that? There's some people that are just all positive, man. You know, and then there's other people that just really go through things, you know, and and uh uh well, you don't have to have any of that. You don't have to have a positive nature it humanly to overcome. You just need God in your life. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And then you've got to believe God's word about what God's word says about the matter. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. So casting down imaginations, reasoning, and every high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God or the word of God. &gt;&gt; What God says, what God's promise is, cast it down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's trying to exalt it itself above that promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. and bring every into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. So, Brother Bram says, "God don't want you to have reason." Reason always tries to find a way out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; God gives you the promise. Well, you know, uh uh on whatever, then you say, "Oh, I I got I got to do something about this. This is getting bad. This is getting worse. This is getting Oh, this is horrible." Well, you know what? We're stressed out. We're worried about it. We're trying to fix it. You ain't fixing nothing. You're making bigger mess. &gt;&gt; Trying to fight your battles. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Because you're not coming to a belief in God's word. &gt;&gt; So reasoning is just trying to work it out. Trying to fix it up. Fix it up. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Trying to find a way out. But faith doesn't reason. Faith just believes. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? And he says, "And a man in another place, and a man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's completely overcome." &gt;&gt; Now, automatically we say, "Oh, overcome then, man. I got a bunch of dos and don'ts that I got to figure it out and I got to live a perfect life and all that." That's that's that's that's wrong. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, a man will never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's completely overcome. Overcome who? Himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody say myself. &gt;&gt; Got to overcome myself. &gt;&gt; I ain't overcoming the banker. I ain't overcoming I ain't overcoming the the spouse. I'm not overcoming the, you know, the preacher and the deacons and and the sound guys. I'm not overcoming, you know, mom and dad. I'm not overcoming, you know, the boss or whatever. The biggest person that you've got to overcome is you. &gt;&gt; That's the person you've got to overcome. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, that's the biggest enemy you got is yourself. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, as uh there there's a cartoon clip and uh in the paper years ago and and is this guy uh he's saying, "Lord, just send lightning on my greatest enemy." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And then the next clip, he's he's he's gone, you know, and smoke is coming out of the ground. &gt;&gt; He was his biggest enemy, and God answered his prayer. &gt;&gt; So, don't pray for your enemies. I mean uh that God will curse them &gt;&gt; because uh it might be you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we we find that that brother Brown said that's the biggest enemy you got is yourself. That's the reason you can't rise up in faith is because you got intellectuals there. Your intellectual part says well this or that or whatever. Well that's reasoning. Just take God at his word and rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, you have to cherish God's word enough to do that. &gt;&gt; We have to find value enough in God's word to actually do that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That if God says it, I've got to value it enough to hold it in my heart to where I can cast down reasonings because I believe God's word is greater than what I think and what the the mayor thinks and what the pope thinks and and what everybody else thinks. God's word is right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so then in order to to receive the seed and to cherish it, the ground's got to be ready for it. &gt;&gt; See, the ground, the prophet said, is the heart. God prepares the heart first. See, so now there are people who hear the word, they laugh at it. There are other people who hear the word and try to grasp it only to end up disappointed. See, brother says, if you went and was prayed for one night and the next morning you say, "Well, I ain't no better." Well, I guess there ain't nothing to it. Oh, what a poor son of Abraham you are. That's right. Yes. See, not much of a son or daughter of Abraham. Well, I was prayed for and and and didn't get me healed. So, I get there's nothing to it. Oh, what a poor crowbait you make for God, right? See, and and and and I'll be be honest, sometimes we find our I find I think we're all guilty of this, you know. Well, I've waited. I've testified. I've claimed it. I've you know, what else is there to do? You know, it just seems to be getting worse. Rest. &gt;&gt; Rest. &gt;&gt; Cultivate the seed. Keep watering the seed with your praise. Brother Brand said that's how we water things. Amen. Is with our praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? If you want to come to church, just water it. Water the water with your praises. The songs that are sung is giving you the opportunity to water to cultivate the seed and and to worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right? So now notice another place. When you've done all that you can do, when you come through the prayer line and been prayed for, your heart doesn't condemn you and you're living right with God. Just hold on to it. &gt;&gt; God has to answer. &gt;&gt; Can you say that with me? God has to answer. He's testing you. If you turn loose the next morning, say, "Well, I ain't no better. I guess there was nothing to it. Well, then you didn't have faith to begin with. If you've got real faith, you'll hold till the last breast gone from your body. You're just certain that God is God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, the believer is the believer is the one that's been prepared to receive the word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Look, God would have never sent the word and and vindicated the word and gave us the interpret the the perfect interpretation of the word by vindication if there was not a se a ground prepared. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Every person that's going to be in a rapture is the ground that God prepared before the foundation of the world. This word will have effect. This message is the shout. How many believes that? It's the shout. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure it is. &gt;&gt; And it's gathering us together. Why? Because the seed, the ground has been prepared to receive it &gt;&gt; and it's working effectively. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. &gt;&gt; So we find brother Brandham says he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age. &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; No way that you could receive him. And he's the word. We know that &gt;&gt; the fullness of the word in this age. And the only way we could receive him in this age is he had to repair us. &gt;&gt; That's why we don't argue with the word. That's why we don't dissect the word and say, "Well, that's part brother Bram's opinion and part this and part that and I don't know about that and and and that was for, you know, in his day, you know, and and and things have changed so much and all." No, we're just good ground. We've been prepared to receive &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; the word for this age. He forneew you by his fornowledge and ordained you to eternal life. He knew you. Therefore, he prepared you. That's the reason you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now. See, it's God leading you to the place where he had ordained for you to be. Aren't you glad you're good ground? &gt;&gt; You've been prepared for this. Well, I don't know if I'm going to make it in the rapture. How could you miss it if God prepared you for it? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So then the devil, he just goes, "Well, see, you just you you just a flop." Oh, &gt;&gt; and then we began to believe it. &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram says, "See, I believe that Christ has a church, and the church is the field." &gt;&gt; And you've got to get the word in the field before the spirit can ever do anything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Why would we need anything more than what God has already given us? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. everything that God has given us in this age. Listen, church, the book's been open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's been open. &gt;&gt; So, it's not like God's lacking in in certain things that he needs to still sow. &gt;&gt; He swed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So either God has prepared a man to receive the word or he hasn't. &gt;&gt; Either I'm prepared to receive the word or I'm not. &gt;&gt; And that goes with all of us. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and and he never God never promised to send anything else &gt;&gt; outside this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, I &gt;&gt; I don't know how if you could see the value in that. &gt;&gt; You you could be sitting in any wares listening to creeds of men, educated men, and all of these things and and and receiving all of that into you and get nowhere's except ready for a tribulation. &gt;&gt; But God placed you in the greatest message ever. [Applause] [Music] that this word could become effective to you to make sure you wouldn't miss the rapture to make sure that you would be at the marriage supper of the lamb to make sure that you would be there when the body changes you would be part of that resurrection &gt;&gt; that you would be part of the adoption of sons &gt;&gt; I believe &gt;&gt; can you say amen &gt;&gt; it's here &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; oh Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so we we find that as it's already been stated, the only ones that uh are receiving the word of God for this day is the elect. Others will criticize it, degrade it, treat it as though it is nothing. They will refuse to believe it. Right? They're intellectual. They become so intellectual and so carnal that they want to take their carnal minds and tell us how the prophet missed it and where he was wrong and he was overbearing and he was this and he was that and he couldn't just, you know, do everything that he preached and live what he preached and all these things. See, and so they claim now they claim to believe the word for another age. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Then then rather than than the word that was given for their age. Amen. The Pharisees and the Sadducees, remember, they claimed to believe the word that Moses had. But they, how dare they refuse, you know, or believe what the word that was right there standing before them, right? They couldn't accept the word then. Amen. Standing there in flesh. Amen. But oh, we believe what Moses said. And Jesus would tell them that Moses preached of me. Moses told of me. Moses prophesied of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's right. &gt;&gt; See, so so they thought that Jesus was diminishing Moses's ministry by what he was preaching and claiming to be. Hey, don't forget Moses. Don't forget Moses. Don't forget all the other prophets. And Jesus said, "But I'm manifesting everything that they preached about. They long to see my day." And I say that's happens again today. Oh, don't forget the reformers. Don't forget this. Don't forget that. Amen. We're not belittling all of them. They had their place. But I promise you, they would rather be in our place. &gt;&gt; They live. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. So then, Brother Bram says, we just accept the ba word upon the basis God said so. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Say that again. We just accept the word on the basis God said so and sets a stream between you and God. Every channel comes open between you and God. them just accept the word on the basis God said so &gt;&gt; don't have to understand it all but God said so &gt;&gt; I just accept it because I find value in what he said &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; can you say amenise &gt;&gt; the Lord &gt;&gt; so the word works effectively in us because it's we're the ground that's been prepared and Romans 10:8 we've read this of course uh But it says, "But what sayith that the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thine heart?" &gt;&gt; That is the word of faith which we preach. &gt;&gt; So it's in thine heart, right? &gt;&gt; That's that God was able to get the word into your heart. &gt;&gt; Now it's in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That shows that the word is having preeminence. Yes, &gt;&gt; it shows now that Satan's thoughts that he's been putting in your mind, you've been able to cast that down and not speak negative. &gt;&gt; But let the word now come into your mouth and you're speaking what the word says. &gt;&gt; I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Every thought that says, "No, you're not." Oh, yes, I am. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; The battle's on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm feeling miserable." Well, it ought to be good because the battle's on. But make sure you yield to the word of God. Make sure you receive the promises of God. Don't you let the devil take that that word and make it of no effect in you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that gentile woman that we read about was prepared ground, did you know that she had no promise to claim? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. For as Jesus said, she was a dog. &gt;&gt; She was a gentile and healing was bread the children, the Jews. &gt;&gt; She came to Jesus off of no promise &gt;&gt; for her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But she had heard what Jesus had been doing. She had heard of the things that were happening and faith struck her heart. &gt;&gt; G. And by her faith, she was inspired to go see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now listen. She heard what Jesus is doing and it struck faith. We're hearing something better than that. We're hearing that the promises actually belong to us. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Is it striking faith in your heart? &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Is it is faith coming alive in your heart &gt;&gt; to where it's causing you to go to that word and lay claim to this word? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; Well, it's going to strike faith in that prepared ground. She was prepared ground. Jesus knew what kind of faith she had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She heard the word. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so we find that when we hear the word of God, it should do something to us. &gt;&gt; And when we hear the testimonies, I you know, I think this is why we should give testimony. If God has done something for you, don't hide that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Talk about it. There's nothing I I think we should be happy &gt;&gt; to testify to the church to people around what God has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because just by hearing will strike faith in somebody's heart. &gt;&gt; Now you see what God did for someone else, we have every right to claim it for ourselves &gt;&gt; because we've been invited not to eat crumbs. You don't have to eat crumbs that fall from the master's table. You've been invited to sit at the master's table. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In the Old Testament, there was a woman by the name of Hannah. And I'll get ready to close, but you're going to have to hang in there cuz I'll quit when I'm done. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. But but when there was a woman by the name of Hannah who couldn't have children, how many remembers that &gt;&gt; she couldn't have children? But the prophet said that she heard &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; that there was another woman that lived before her time whose name was Sarah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She was barren, too. &gt;&gt; She couldn't have children. but heard that God had blessed her and she received a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And based upon that testimony, faith struck her heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that day she went to the temple. &gt;&gt; She had been made fun of as a barren woman and all these things, but that day she went to the temple. And everybody else, maybe brother Brand depicts the plaint the picture. Maybe they were talking about groceries and they were talking about their cows and they were talking about this. But she came for a purpose. &gt;&gt; She had a desire. She had something faith had struck into her heart. If God can do it for Sarah, God can do it to me. No matter how bad I am, no matter how impossible it seems, God done it then. God can do it today. And she got at that altar and she wept and she prayed until the priest thought she was drunk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But she valued what she heard. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She changed what she heard. &gt;&gt; She received it for her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet rebuked her. How dare you be a drunk woman in the temple of God. She says, "I'm not a drunk." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preach. is I'm a woman in travail. &gt;&gt; You know me, Eli. I've been laughed at and I've been scorned at and I've been made fun of and it's been in a mockery and embarrassment cuz I can't have children. &gt;&gt; But I heard a testimony one time. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to approach that same God. And I ain't stopping until he gives it to me. And Eli says, "You'll have what you you asked for. Go in peace." &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and she had exactly what she asked for. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, because she heard. See, she heard. Now, Brother Bram says, "Now, if Mr. John Doe out here had cancer and was healed, so can you that have it and be healed." &gt;&gt; If John Doe got healed of cancer, you can be healed of cancer. Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? If one blind man can receive his sight, then so can you. If you're blind, if a crippled person can rise up out of a wheelchair and walk, so can you. If you're crippled and can't walk, don't diminish God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And upon hearing and seeing what God is doing, lay claim to it. If God healed a a person of a toothache, what makes him stop to where he can't do you? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Did you know that's how Congressman Upshaw got healed? &gt;&gt; He was in a wheelchair, he was immut Congressman Upshaw, who preached, he says, uh, when he read of Florence Nightingale and her trouble. Now, you all know, how many knows the story of Florence Nightingale? You've heard that story? She she only weighed 40 lbs. They got that picture of her where she is just just skin and bone, just limbs and skin just around the limbs. Right. Amen. And here's a man in a wheelchair, can't walk, been 66 years that way. And he begins to hear the story. &gt;&gt; He said he had heard of this shoemaker down here who had been paralyzed, a Baptist deacon lying in his chair for about 10 years, willing him up down the floor uh to do his work. his office at the Baptist church when a vision appeared over him and saying he was bound in that wheelchair for those years with his back broken up and down in this place had sprints in his back until he couldn't even move and the man was perfectly whole. Amen. See? Amen. And and he heard of the story of Florence Nightingale. Amen. And how God had healed her and and and Congressman Upshaw said this. Now, this is where it happened. Now, he didn't just say, "Oh, that's a good story. That's really nice. I need to tell the my children this. No, he was in need. He had a need. He needed something, too. And he said, "If God can do that, God can do me." Amen. 66 years. He would never let that 66 years, Amen. Hold him back because he believed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says if Florence Nightingale could be made whole as she was dying with cancer and only weighed 40 lbs, so can every person be healed that has cancer. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Good preaching. &gt;&gt; He says if little Georgie Carter at Miltown laying there 9 years and 8 months, &gt;&gt; Amen. Couldn't even move her hands. Couldn't raise her butt cup. TB run all the way through her. Give her up five years before left by doctors. Never had seen the trees or nothing for nine years and six months. and in one moment's time was made perfectly well 8 years ago is play a piano player in the Miltown Baptist church tonight. If she can be healed of that of TB, so can you in every case. &gt;&gt; Every case. &gt;&gt; Every case. Your case is not isolated to God. God has given you testimony after testimony after testimony. And yet you're not like that gentile woman who had no promise to claim. You've got every promise. Every promise. If God rode the Red back the Red Sea, you've got a promise for that. If God delivered the four the three Hebrew children out of the fiery furnace, you got a promise of that. God will deliver you. God will roll back the Red Sea just for you. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Glory. &gt;&gt; God gave these stories to build our faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Get our minds out of the garbage cans. &gt;&gt; Quit feeding off the negative. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Negative is a bad thing that has gripped the world. &gt;&gt; Most everyone speaks negative, thinks negative, talks negative. God can do something for them and they're still talking negative. &gt;&gt; They can see God doing things all around them and they're still talking negative. God be merciful to us if we talk negative. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change our language. Let the word be in our heart and in our mouth. And when you receive the word, hold on to that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, God doesn't need to come to us in the form of a bolt, lightning bolt. He doesn't need to come to us in some spectacular way. He sent his word. &gt;&gt; And all we need to do is believe it the same way Abraham believed it. &gt;&gt; You see, receive the word the same way Abraham received it. How did he receive it? As a promise &gt;&gt; and believe it the same way he believed it. &gt;&gt; Now, listen to what brother Brandham says. after 25 years of ministry for the Lord in his work and in his word and after this being coming in my 12th year of international evangelism and by the grace of God to meeting tens of thousands of people and seeing our Lord move in our campaigns now as I have seen him seen to him right in towards 2 million or a million and 500,000 somewhere along there in the meeting. So he's given us his if we could say his credential, right? &gt;&gt; That he ain't just a fly by night. He ain't just one that just got up and don't know nothing. But notice, I've come to this conclusion and all of all of our efforts and so forth, it's impossible for God to do anything for the people until the people first get settled on whether it's truth or not. &gt;&gt; Of all the things that he had seen, he's finally he came to that conclusion. God can't do nothing for the people until the people get settled in their heart whether it's truth or not. &gt;&gt; Is God's word true? &gt;&gt; Is God's word a promise? [Music] &gt;&gt; We must be settled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another place, God wants somebody who will not give up. A winner never quits and a quitter never wins. &gt;&gt; Listen, you got to stay and call it. &gt;&gt; Call things right before Satan. Tell him it's this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord. The Lord has said so and that it is written. &gt;&gt; It's written. No matter what he says, it's written. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's why we need to get in our Bibles. That's why we need to hear a prophet speak and give us the right interpretation. &gt;&gt; Because the devil has had enough of his talking to us. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Convincing us that this word is not right. You say, "Oh, I'll always believe the word." Then we must believe for what belongs to us. &gt;&gt; We can believe it in for a general, but now we've got to take that word for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Well, brother Bram never got to touch me. But it is written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram never done no healing. God done your healing. It's already did. &gt;&gt; It's written. &gt;&gt; Whatever I ask and believe God, I shall receive it. It's mine. My personal property. &gt;&gt; That's the way you receive the word. &gt;&gt; That's how you cherish the word. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. another place. We just receive his word just like it was he himself. &gt;&gt; When I see his promise to me, that's Christ and I embrace it cuz he can't lie. &gt;&gt; To me, that's exactly the truth. I might not know how to take a hold of it, but it's the truth. And I hold right with it because it's Christ to me. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Every word of this Bible, every promise of God is Christ to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. You embrace the promise, you're embracing Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, Satan set out to exalt himself above the most high as we know, to sit in the temple of God, to be worshiped as God, and to be God. Brother Brandham says he has succeeded in carrying out his threats. He has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word to that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly how he's done it. In every age, he's explained it away. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil explain the value of God's word away. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. If the musicians will come &gt;&gt; preaching the &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet to give us the perfect interpretation of the word by divine vindication. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Satan's still anointing his ministers to explain the value of that word away. &gt;&gt; The value of the promise. But brother Bram says, "I do not care how much the devils beat you down with sickness." Whoa. He sounds heartless. No, he's so true on the word. &gt;&gt; He so believes that word. I don't care how much the devil's beat you down with sickness, with leukemia, with cancer, with tuberculosis, or crippled, or whatever he's done. You just take that promise of God, the word of God, and say, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; What a word to speak. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; Good. Very good. I've um watched, you know, the antique show, the road show where people bring in things that they have no idea the value of they take it there to be appraised. I like watching their faces, you know, and I like learning the value of of of things. And sometimes you'll see the disappointment and the countenance drop in people because the appraiser didn't give them the value that they thought it was worth. come to find out it would be a counterfeit. It would be something that was it just didn't hold worth and and the person thought that here they were holding this as something valuable and then I've seen where people have cried. They just get beside themselves. They don't they just become speechless because they'll have a little painting or they'll have a little object and something or even just a piece of paper or it could be even a ticket from some well-known uh a person back in in 19 or 1800s and they've got it there and the appraiser will tell them 10,000 a million and you'll start to see them crying cuz they didn't know the value. Yeah. And now they're cherishing it with everything they got. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because somebody told them it's valuable &gt;&gt; and and that's nice. That's nice. But I thought, you know, what about when people don't see value &gt;&gt; in the word of God? Do we go by what they value the word to be? &gt;&gt; No. I thought brother Brandham he said one time that a man had given him a just a 22 gun barrel just a 20 just a gun barrel of a 22. He said he took it home and he carved out a stock put that barrel and made him made him a 22. He said, "Now the gun's probably worth 50 cents, a dollar." But he says, "I wouldn't care if they gave me a million. I would never sell it because I see value. It's valuable to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every time I see it, it reminds me of that brother." &gt;&gt; And so he says, "I wouldn't sell it." See, so so what somebody else would look and say, "Oh, that's a piece of junk." To him, it became valuable. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, there's people that look at this and they appraise it for whatever and they say, "Well, it's just not much. It's counterfeit. It has so much contradictions and and all these things and and of course, I view the message to be the word of God just as well." And they pick that apart and they see no value in it. They they see nothing. But see, every time I see the word and every time I listen to it and and I read it, I see Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It reminds me of my promises. It reminds me of what I've been delivered from. It reminds me of where I'm going. It reminds me that it ain't about me. It's all about him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It reminds me that there has been a finished work in my life. &gt;&gt; Nah, it's invaluable to me. Let the world do what they want to do. But this ain't for sale. My belief ain't for sale. My convictions ain't for sale. &gt;&gt; It's more than a book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's something. It's my life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. What's &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord? The battle is over. Victory is won. It's already done. Oh, sing it now. Oh, it's already done. Hallelujah. [Music] It's already &gt;&gt; Oh yes, &gt;&gt; the battle is over. Victory is won. It's already done. I have overcome. Oh, I have overcome. Hallelu. I have overcome. Praise the Lord. The battle is over. Oh, glory to God. Oh, I am healed. I'm already healed. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. The battle is over. The victory is won. I'm already healed. Now, here's what Brother Brandham says in his prayer. He said, "God, help us to get our faith in the right place tonight and move out on the battleground there and say, Satan, you're a liar." &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ died to make me free and it's mine. Get out of here. Yes, &gt;&gt; God. Place our faith there. &gt;&gt; That we can step out on that battleground and look at the devil and say, "Get out of here. You're a liar. &gt;&gt; You're defeated. You have no place." Can you say amen? Can we do that? Oh yes, we can. Because the word of God is in our heart and we give over to the word. We let the word have the preeminence in us. Can you say amen? Hallelujah. Let's stand to our feet and sing it now. Oh, it's already done. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. The battle is over. Victory is won. It's already done. Oh, sing it again. Oh, it's already done. Hallelujah. It's already done. Praise the Lord. The battle is over. The victory is won. It's already done. [Music] Oh, there ain't nothing nothing too hard for you. I may stumble everything do. I may worry, hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. [Music] Words. All the children had their backs to that Red Sea. And oh Pharaoh looked like he had the victory. But the waters rolled on back with the breath you blew. And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, Joshua took a wall around Jero. And you told him, Lord, you told him that the wall would go and it crumbled at that shout when the trumpets blew. And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Sing it down. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. I may falter, stumble in everything I do. Oh, and I may worry, hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Now, Elijah, all them prophets said that he was wrong. Send the fire down to their gods. They prayed all day long. Then Elijah prayed down all the [Music] nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Now church, I was lonely. Sin had broken my heart into all the pieces. I couldn't win with the strongest glue. But the Lord Jesus, you took the pieces and made me new. And it ain't nothing. Now, if he can put you back together and make you like new, can he heal your body? Can he bring you through the trial? Can he bring a restoration? Can he save your children? Hallelujah. Oh, I may worry, hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Now this body is slowly dying without within. But I ain't worried though the skin worms eat my skin. Cuz you'll open heaven's door and I'll walk right in. Cuz it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. I may falter, stumble into everything I do. I may worry, hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't. Can you just turn around, shake somebody's hand, just say, "It ain't nothing for God. It ain't nothing for him. Oh, I may falter. Hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you." Now I hate this body. It's slowly dying without within. But I ain't worried though. The skin worms ate my skin. Cuz Lord, you'll open heaven's door. I'll walk right in. Cuz it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing. Oh, let the bride see it now. It ain't nothing. Do you believe that? I may falter, stumble in everything I do. [Music] I may falter, stumble at everything I do. Oh, I may worry, hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. He'll do it again for you. He'll do it again. [Music] Oh, just take a look at where you are now and where you've been. [Music] Hasn't he always come through for you? He's the same now as there. You may not know how. You may not know when. But you'll do it again. Oh, he'll do it again for you. He'll do it again. Oh, just take a look at where you are now. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Where you been? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As he always come through for you. He's the same now as [Music] &gt;&gt; you may not know how. You may not know when, but you'll do it again. If I could remember the story right, a minister that knew Brother Brennan pretty well, he brought a friend that was really really sick and and they both lived out of out of the uh state. Uh lived in Arkansas, but he had brought that friend all the way to Indiana for brother Brandham to pray for him. And brother Brown prayed for him and told him says, 'You now you're healed. Everything's over. And sure enough, the day went by, great. A week went by, doing pretty good. But then the brother got a received a call from this man and says, "Oh, it's back again. I I I just all the symptoms and I'm just so sick and I just don't know." He said, "I thought I was healed." He goes, "Well, I I thought you were too." Hang on just a moment. I'll try to get a hold of brother Brandham. And so, he was able to reach Brother Brandham. And he told Brother Brand, "Oh, brother Brandham, I that remember that man you prayed for? He's it's all back again." And he he just don't know what to do. And he's sick and and the symptoms. And he says, "What what? I thought he was healed." And Ram says, "Oh, brother." He said, "You tell him, don't you worry about all that." He says, "It's just a cat scratching at the door." He said, "He's fine." He told brother, he called that that man up and says, "Ah, don't you worry about it, Vet." He said, "You ain't sick." He said, "It's just the scratch scratching at the door trying to get back in." He said, "Just ignore it." He said, "Right then." And just left him. Never got sick again off of that situation. Amen. You say, "Well, I've been prayed for. I really thought I was feeling better. Ah, just a scat cat scratching at the door. Just ignore it. Just say just believe God. I'm healed. Can you say amen? God bless you. Love you. Thank you for your patience. And uh good to again have uh the granddaughters here. Amen. And uh God bless you. We really appreciate your mom and dad and your brothers too. And um and so uh um God bless you all. May you all have a wonderful week. Keep sis uh keep sister Lisa's daughter Rebecca in prayer. Um I just a lot of things going on and you know it uh I I don't know. I know the doctor um I was told the doctor made her sign a thing last night that if she was to die, you know, did she want to be revived? She said no. And all these things. Uh it's it's a serious situation from what I'm hearing. And so we we just want to keep her in prayer. I got to talk to her a little bit about the Lord today and she just cried and cried and cried, you know, and um I'm going to try to go back tomorrow and talk with her, but u just never know just believing God will arrest her heart. Amen. So just keep her in prayer, keep brother Josiah and brother Judah in prayer as they're traveling. Amen. And um God bless you, brother Amos, do you want to dismiss us in prayer? Heavenly Father God, we want to thank you for this. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
