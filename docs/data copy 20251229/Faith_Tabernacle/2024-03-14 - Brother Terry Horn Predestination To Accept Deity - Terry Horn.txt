glory to glory he's changing us and I'm thankful for that we we certainly needed a nature change we're born in sin shape iniquity come to this world speaking lives but we had to have a nature change be able to love him good to see everybody going to thank you musicians we're going to go ahead and get into the word I don't want to hold you too long tonight I guarantee I'll let you out by 10:00 guaranteed guaranteed yeah guaranteed I want you to turn if you will in your scriptures Bibles to um the text that brother RAM used for Christ is a mystery and we all know what that is don't we I better go ahead and say at Colossians 127 praise the Lord and we going to read actually 25 through 28 it's just a glorious time to be living in deceiving time Hard Times uncertain you can turn me down a little bit get a little ringing up here feedback or something but um it's a wonderful time to be living prise Lord I'm I'm glad I'm alive in this day amen glad to know the truth where would we be if we didn't have the truth we wouldn't be out there deceived like everybody else but thank God for election predestination he called us chose us said he's going to have a perfect bride and I just you know I'm just dumb enough to believe I'm one of them just one of them so so let's look right into the word Colossians 1 start with 25 and the Bible says whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God sure appreciate those messages brother Shan been teaching on preaching on Ministries there all kinds of Ministries and so much in the different Ministries whether it be the fivefold ministry Ministry of each individual person verse 26 even the mystery remember in the Bible everywhere it says mystery you can just think of secret because it's in the emphatic dialogue it's always secret even the secret of God the mystery of God which had been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints you have to remember that was written in Paul's day about 865 or something like that but it wasn't really understand a lot of the scriptures had to be written to put in this cannon of the scripture but were really applied to our date as far as full understanding manifestation and so forth like brother Ben said I'm going to call you bride so that you will understand yes yeah so that you might understand verse 27 to whom God would make known or reveal what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is let's everybody say it Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that here's a reason that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus mat remember the Ephesus Church was a infant bride this is the mature bride this is the adopted bride this is a last day bride that was just the infant church this is the mature church this is the church that really has the full understanding of the Revelation the word now while you're standing I want to read this quote uh tremendous and Christ mry brother man says the new birth is Christ is the revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery that's the new birth now what are you going to do when you when what are you going what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same signs he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is what when he says what it is he didn't say who he is which you know it's it's all tied together but he's talking about if the church knew its position then the Rapture go when he knows what it is what its position is so that's that's the focus on that sentence but we know it's Rec bride recognizes who she is so all through the lesson tonight I want you to think on this if you could just only if we could only truly truly truly recognize who we are that's the whole Focus today you know 40 years ago we come to message God God sent a prophet you know uh prayer lines hunting trips all those things wonderful understanding the you know the the the opening of the word in very Simplicity but this is maturity time this is allog together different Focus you got to we have to recognize who we are we're going to need that one day we're going to need that amen then the Rapture will go so if you can only recognize and accept who you really are we won everybody and do everything we can to help us to better realize who and what we are amen some people say well Jesus never said who he really was I beg you pardon he did St John 4 the woman of the well say when a messiah comes he'll tell us these things he said I am he that talks you he did tell me I am the Messiah of course he knew who he was we have to recognize who we are let's pray brother Sean would you lead us in prayer father thank you Jesus approach the word tonight father we pray Lord that your word can find the bedding place in our heart yes Lord May the power of creation do a creative work within us father bless your name thank you Jesus father that we may understand who we are tonight father and I pray that you would just bless the ministering of your word anoint bless your name our prayer anoint our ears and hearts to hear and receive thank you Jesus Jesus Christ name amen thank you Lord you can be seated in the name of the Lord Jesus so when we talk about uh my title tonight it's predestinated to accept deity now when we talk about well I want to give kind of equal emphasis to predestination uh accepting and deity and we talk about predestinate to accept deity now we're we're talking about predes to accept deity in you now we know Christ was deity so that's not the issue not accepting that Christ was deity deity in us our deity the deity that's been assigned to us we got to accept that it's more important brother man said it's more important you believe what the word says you are than what you think you are yourself so what it declares that's the way it's going to be so let's look at that a little bit tonight if we can predestinated to accept deity now one of the hardest things for us to do is to lay aside religious Traditions you know and you know somebody might say well you know everybody's doing it so much must be right well that's kind of the Catholic Church you know we we stood for 1,700 years well they killed 68 million no wonder they stood you know they had the power the you know the Inquisition everything else if it didn't line up you just you know cut their head off you know but no but I mean but Jesus said straight is the gate and there's a way a few be that find it so just because the masses believe it that's that's the best way to be we better realize better get away from that because only uh few be that find it so we understand that now this is Satan's Eden and almost everything we see taste feel smell here we know it's it's contrary to God's word it's deceptive it's carnal and you know that brother man said that God took 6,000 years to conform this world to what he wanted to be and Satan took 6,000 years to deform this world to what he wanted to be so now Satan is the God of this evil age he's the God of this world and so he is he is he is the ruler of all Kingdoms at this present time God's got it all in control but Satan is the ruler of this Earth at this present time now we've never had a messenger who could ever stand and correctly make this statement that I'm going to read we've read it so many times in visible Union but to just show us what I want the direction we want to go he said you are standing completely Justified can can we accept this statement you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now you are pure now he's declaring what you are I'm going to call you a bride you are pure P virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman born of the spirit of God washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sin at the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ you are perfect now he is making a declaration of what we are can can we accept that yes can we truly accept that we we we we have it here amen do we have it here truly that's saying can we can we really accept for yourself who you are as I said it's more important you got to believe what the word says we are than what we feel we are because we got to get away from C taste feel smell here we're not by feelings at all it's by faith it's by revelation we must accept it by Revelation now God yes God put that identifier in you brother man calls it representation that predestinated seed of God germ of God God's life it was dormant for many years until the light of the word struck that seed and it came to life but he was there we were born with it God put it there you know our names were put on the lands but before the foundation of world we know that so that representation was put there God put it there we've got to accept the fact that God put it there amen we got to we got to you we we we have to accept that there's something about we have to accept it amen as the story was told and I'm going to tell this little story because it fits with the the lesson night and it's was told about Napoleon and I remember this story being told actually brother um arasmus Theo arasmus told it down in the camp meeting probably 35 years ago you were probably down there at the meetings you brother Rasmus and and brother green all them back years ago and way The Story Goes it's true story about Napoleon the great conqueror and one day that Napoleon was out he was on his white horse and he was had a passing review with all of his soldiers had them all lined up Rank and filed you know and he was passing through them inspecting the soldiers and and had a big field day I guess you would say and they were all at attention you know it's a great Mighty conqueror napol would pass through just Rose after Rose after Rose and different brigades of them and so as he was passing through on his White Horse there uh and now you know you stand in a tition I mean and when if you move if you break record anything they chop your head off I mean you're gone you're just a little old one strip or a little Corporal or whatever it was you know you you you don't do anything contrary to Napoleon I mean he's he's the he's the great conqueror so anyway he's was passing by right in front of this group of soldiers all these soldiers here and it's standing in attention and about that time his true story his White Horse it stumbled so this one soldier right in front he actually broke Rank and ran up to to the horse to steady the horse which he could have been killed for it he steadied the horse and Napoleon looks down to the little Corporal and he says thank you Captain and the little Buck Sergeant the little Corporal looks up at Napoleon says thank you sir I accept think about that so the next words out of the little corporal's mouth was he said sir to which Brigade am I the captain of so wheels are going in Napoleon's mind he said you will now be the captain of the ninth Brigade so NPO so a little now he got a feel promotion so he he breaks Rank and he goes out through the multitudes there he says where is the n Brigade where is the ninth Brigade I am now the captain of the ninth Brigade and they said what what are you doing what are you doing don't you know he could kill you who told you to do this have you ever heard of Napoleon like okay I got the authority so Napoleon tells his right-hand man that's with him right there he said now listen here this is the focus he said you train that man up he'll be exactly what I said he was and thus he did you know how Israel when they find a lot of their leaders in the military different places and probably they probably do in some different schools I know they'll take a little young children like that fourth fifth sixth grade where they go out to recess and and out of 30 40 children you're going to have one or two leaders you always there one of one of them is going to be a leader they see there's a certain trait there's a certain characteristic about that young child so they said that's going to be a leader right there he he shows that potential for leadership and that's one way that they find their their leader so so we have to accept what God has said now there was something about that little Corporal I mean there was something in there why in the face of death he could have been killed for that why did he break rake and because of his loyal master Napoleon he wanted to save his life he was willing to risk his life for his master so he is willing to risk his life and he did but look what his promotion was I accept I I I told that that same story in another sermon years ago when I preached at Dar Salam and a camp meeting there in Tanzania and brother shija he liked it so much he just made he said I accept that become the theme for the whole camp meeting I accept so that's what we want to do we accept we certainly want to accept and thank God we have yes amen praise the lord it's 10:00 going to come here soon yes train up that man he'll be exactly what they said he was now that man had a certain characteristic now listen God put something in us now remember Mankind in his Fallen State we we had had no desire for God we had the Bible says God seeks man man does not seek God now don't don't get confused with that because after you're born again after you're truly converted born again you do seek after God you want more of God you want all of God but before that you no man can call Jesus the Christ except the Holy Ghost draws in first it's not in a uh unregenerated person to seek after God it's just not there God has to put that in there so we have to accept the fact that there's something in there it might be dormant for many many years but our fallen nature we had nothing to desire God no no no means to love God right now here's a let's listen to this this uh quote here out of Easter seal and this is really good here's a tremendous quote about Abel about Abel really tremendous out of the Easter seal they put him to death speaking of Jesus brother man said they put him death killed him just like they did faithful Abel why was Abel killed now listen to this statement why was Abel killed now we know just jealousy Cain got jealous as his brother we know because you know Cain's sacrifice was not was refused Abel's sacrifice was accepted it was accepted but why was he killed not only jealousy but why was he jealous brother man said because not talking about Abel because in his heart he had the revelation of God's acceptance of what it took to redeem man from sin yeah I'm going read that again because in his heart he had the revelation of God's acceptance of what it took to REM redeem man from sin he knew it was blood Abel knew it was by Blood he had that Revelation that's the reason they put Jesus to death because in him was the revelation of what had taken for God to cure sin that's the very reason today that we're against the that's the very reason today that they're against the real Church of the Living God because it preaches the cure for sin the things that makes people live different amen so I thought that was real good about able he had that revelation of what God would accept that's why I could correctly use this title of predestinated to accept deity we've got that Revelation but God gave us that Revelation nothing Upon Our Own that's right now we believe in predestination we don't have that's one thing we don't have to in the message we do not have to convince anybody of predestination but I I I just there's hundreds of quotes but I just wrote down to I just want to uh just I don't want to confirm anything because we all believe it but I thought this these were good Paul in Romans 8 he said foolish man who can tell the the Potter what to do about it when the clay raises up says why you why make me this or thus did not he raise Pharaoh up for the same purpose that he might show his glory down in Egypt he hardens who he will justify who he will it's not him that willth or him that runthe mercy so listen what he brother says so you have nothing to do with it you have it one thing to do it's Grace it's a free gift there's not one thing you can do about it God has given it to you and that's the will of God that's the thing that God has predestinated in you God put that Jean that seed that that that life even though it was dormant for years he put that in your soul you were born with that in your soul the preacher didn't put it there God put it there that's right another place he said Moses couldn't help being Moses and Jeremiah God Jeremiah God called him before he was even formed in his mother's womb said I knew you Sanctified you and ordained you to be a prophet said he had nothing to do with it yeah so we got to and we believe this you know now when we was in Pentecost there's you in Pentecost you don't mention predestination they throw you out on your ear I mean they did not believe in pred none zero but thank God we have a revelation of it and I know it's you know to really understand predestination it takes it takes it takes a little bit of re Revelation because you know it's not God's will that any should perish you know and God's no respect of persons and on and on and on but he is the great Potter and we're the clay the Potter has the right to make one vessel of honor and another vessel Of Dishonor that's just God now it's we need to understand for for my lesson tonight we need to understand stand from the beginning God's purpose and Satan's purpose dealing with Humanity so I got really a an interesting thought here that help God's purpose and Satan's purpose now God's power to transform let's just read for a moment in the book of Isaiah let's go down fourth uh 14th chapter oh we know the scripture how they're far from Heaven oh Lucifer and then so he reads that scripture brother man says Satan's purpose from Eden listen now Satan's purpose from Eden was to make his own self an Eden and exalt himself above so the stars of God would worship Him Sons would worship Him and and this is in Satan this is in God's power to transform 1965 and brother Ben says and he has absolutely carried it out now Satan is the God of this world no question about that we know that to be true it was his desire to be worshiped Supreme control of this Earth what he does after 6,000 years he has succeeded you could say this day this scripture is fulfilled all right so we must understand that that's what that's what Satan desired Lucifer's desired and we we must understand that okay now Satan is presently the God of this evil AE you're living in Satan's jungle and all the wild beast you're camping out with we got to live with them every day but you know what in the midst of all that God still has a spotless Bride on this Earth today as I speak is living today not will be is living today and we're in the closing pages of history and you're living in Satan's Paradise Satan's Ena Eden Satan Zenith but this is still the day for the bride the move is on for the bride now watch this listen here in God of this evil a you talking about Satan how dominating Satan is today how much influence he's had today where he is today with his children listen Satan Satan's got children brother B says now listen for Satan is not spoke of as the god of any other age but this age he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of Noah he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of Moses the god of the age of Elijah but this evil age he is oh don't miss it he is a God now listen he is a God of this evil age worship I'm going to read it just like he said worshiped by millions and billions millions and billions of people and they don't know it that is sad that is sad and you know what most of them people will not make it most of them people will not be saved I mean that's straight As the gate in every way few be that find it when you think about election and predestination brothers and sisters you ought to be so thankful every day and I'm not saying you don't you probably do thank God he let me see it thank God he predestinated me thank God I can understand it thank God he gave me a desire to understand it thank God I can see the what little bit I can see thank God he let me see this truth Satan is worshiped by millions and millions in this day and they don't even know it that's true they're blinded to it what a day what a day so Satan is a God of this world now Satan listen Satan's trium because he's become the god of this world that's that's no hindrance to God Satan Satan only works by permission so God permitted Satan to do this and so he only works by permission God is still got it all in control sure amen remember this as we well know this is honing down honing down time Capstone time getting lesser and lesser fewer and fewer okay like job God had a hedge around him we know God had a head around job's soul today we have a hedge around our soul it's called The Token the token Satan could only do to job what God permitted Satan to do to job Satan can only do to us what God permits Satan to do to us but he cannot get to that now why is this last generation so different remember this is the age of the pale horse rider that fourth old Grizzly colored mix pale sickly looking old horse everything in this age is hybrid we know that yeah hybrid religion the church is hybrid the marriages are hybrid food is hybrid politics is hybrid everything's hybrid but on the other side of the coin on the other side of the coin this is a bride AE the only age named after God's wife the bride the seals are open the full word been born in the manifestation the token could only come in the evening time it's the only age of Total Restoration everything that Adam lost has been restored back in our day today wonderful age to be living amen even the spoken word you said the spoken word what about them squirrels what do you think that was God gave him he said speak you're out honey what do you need the spoken word even in E condition when the Colorado Storm was rebuked he's coming off that mountain said why don't you walk with me goes down he comes back up goes back up and and speaks to the storm and rebukes storm and goes away by the spoken word goes back down off the mountain like that he sees those three deer and the deer come to him said I could shoot all three of you you know just as as as quick as you know he could reload like that but he said they just kept getting closer and closer and closer he said I'm walking down this mountain and virgin Timber why did he say virgin Timber why did the animals you know not fear that man why after he had spoke that it's a eating condition just like it was back in the Garden of Eden same kind of eating condition there so we see the first manifestation first matured Son of God oh so now and this is the only age where brother M taught us that the age where the Mighty God Veil unveiled before us that the only ways that the word is made flesh the word is made flesh deity walking again in shoe leather we've got to accept that deity the only people that has heard from their theophany this is the age you got to remember now Satan had his plan but God had his plan everything that Adam lost has been restored back to it so what is God going to do it only makes sense he's going to have a bride that's perfect just like just like at the beginning was perfect not in our flesh but because we have been our Nature has been changed our soul has been changed everything about our Inside Man the real you has been changed so it's gone back to that Perfection again so we're at a but we're at a tremendous dilemma a bride is coming to her Zenith a church is rising up and Satan is at his Seth that he's the God of this evil age so the stage is set for a final battle so we know who's going to win yes amen s Satan is flexing his muscles and the bride's recognizing who she is so we have the greatest battle ever fought don't we now brother B says this in God perfecting these church now in verse he says now uh to make he said to make you perfect and to bring you back into Fellowship he's God perfect this church he's talking about what God wants to do make us perfect and bring us back into Fellowship to make you perfect now remember what we read in in verse 28 of Colossians that we may pres the Paul said that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus that means mature not perfect in our flesh mature adopted sons of God make you perfect and bring you back into Fellowship Fellowship like he had in the Garden of Eden the right kind of Fellowship he he brings you through that blood cell to himself you get it through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus that veiled the life of Jehovah and we coming through that blood cell becomes part of that life his life so deity itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Ghost deity in itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Ghost I'm going to say that about seven times so deity itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Ghost when you get it catch up with me so deity itself lays in the man that's receed the Holy Ghost let's all see it deity in itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Ghost or a woman so you got that you truly been have a word birth you've been born to the spirit of God you your your whole life and focus and everything is Jesus Christ you truly know you've been born from above deity lays inside of you but you've got to accept that that's right you got to accept that brother B says so deity itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Spirit remember and I don't want to get off I don't want to get off because the Bible says in the book of Acts God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey why why do a lot of people when they repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy why don't they receive the go Holy Ghost say actually you should you could you should but most people don't why there's a reason brother explains that in many different places so I'll just let that go you research it so deity lays inside the man that Fe the Holy Spirit you are son I'm Brandon by birth I'm part part of Mr Miss brandom is in me and if you become a son and daughter of God part of deity lays in you so Napoleon is saying thank you Captain the little Corporal says thank you sir I accept I accept he said I'm a captain I'm a captain he said I'm the the captain of the ninth Brigade I'm going to find the ninth Brigade we're talking about Ministry brother sea whatever he declares us to do let's find out what he wants us to do and do it he's done declared it let's do it we're going to do it he made a way that we could do it so you see how the devil robs you said oh I can't do this all things are possible them that believe no matter what it is you are a part of deity deity not deity deity you are a part of deity amen no matter what is you a part of deity a son of uh a son not a servant a son and daughter not a servant I got to thinking about a son not a servant amen and I don't want to preach the the message of the prodical son but you know when the prodical son left God is inheritance went down there and he left it spent all of his inherence and come to himself realizing hey you know all the food that even the servants eat better than I do now I'm starving this so he said I'm going to go back tell my father I'm sorry just make me a servant I am no longer worthy to be a son make me a servant so when the prodical son is coming back home it's a very very interesting thing takes place as a prodical son's coming home preach whole message on so you're going to get another message free here tonight what happens what happens the father first of all the father saw now we're talking about he's a son not a servant we are Sons and Daughters of God not servants the Jews are servants we're Sons and Daughters the father sees the prodical son coming back first of all if he a far off so for him to seem a far all first of all he had to be looking for him he wasn't doing his work of about B he had to be looking for him he saw him a far off second thing is when he saw him a far off he ran to meet him now it's absolutely for for Elder a Hebrew Elder is absolutely a disgrace for a Hebrew Elder to run that's Jewish law but he broke every protocol he ran to meet him they're not supposed to run at all that's that's Jewish law not only that he fell on his neck and kissed him that's a sign of welcome I mean he spent all his living in right righteous living but he welcome me back didn't ask no question he welcome him back then he gets him back to the house he puts the best robe on him you can see why the elder brother was jealous why the elder brother hated it now you got to understand the best robe what about the best robe servants wore short robes the sons wore long robes but the best robe was one a robe that was stored in the house and only used for special occasions no other time so he has bring out the best robe and put it on this man put it on this Renegade you might say that's the way the world would look at it not only that but he puts a ring on his finger what does that symbolize that symbolize honor and d and honor and dignity what did this son do he he wasted all of his money what honor and dignity he' had but the father put it on him I'm talking about the Father's Love I'm talking about the Father's Love For sons and not servants what God how God loves us not only he put a ring on his finger he put shoes on his feet what does that represent no shoes barefooted all slaves were barefooted they took their shoes away they wore slaves so he came back bare fo but the father says put shoes on him that's a sign of sunship that's a sign of Freedom again he put shoes on his feet then he says he then he gets him back to the house and he tells the wife there to or service he said kill the fatted C brother sister that was not peanut butter and jelly that was the fatted Cal why why do you why do you think that the elder brother said yeah look you haven't never done this for me I've served you all this years you never done that for me but what was it it was once he was dead now he's alive he was in sin he's come back alive amen why shouldn't he why shouldn't he dress him up he was a son he never was a servant he was a son he was just a backsliding son a fallen son but he was still his son to me that Parable should have been the Father's Love instead of the prodical son all that focused to me was on the father what he did for him oh tremendous tremendous story brother and at the at the bottom of this paragraph brother B is talking about being part of God through the blood cell he said that's what makes Satan mad that's what shakes him when the Church of Jesus Christ only knew who they were brother he's talking about recognizing you're part of that blood cell when that blood cell was broken in Calvary you were in there you're in there part of God through that blood in Christ of mystery brother says the new birth is a revelation God has revealed this to this you this great mystery that's the new birth oh if the church knew its position well one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is got to read that again amen so we must recognize you're part of God you're a part of your father we're a part of we're made we're a family it's Christ in you the Bible said it's Christ in you the hope of glory and I think about that many times Christ in you it's just like the scripture uh the foot washing scripture and Jesus is telling Peter said if I wash you not you have no part with me he didn't say you have no part in me because Peter was he was predestinated to have the kingdom to have the keys to the kingdom rather he was chosen of God to be one of the 12 apostles how can Jesus turn around and say well because you didn't wash my face you have no part in me he couldn't say that he knows he was ordained a lie but he said if you have no part with me that means you have no Fellowship but he didn't say you have no part in me it's a whole you got to watch these words he said you have no part with me Fellowship he didn't say you didn't have any part in me because he was predestinated to be part of them oh it's just beautiful I just love the Bible you know it's every word is just amen and perfect think about that Peter was chosen to receive the keys to the kingdom as I said and so and and also Peter was predestinated God to be one of the 12 apostles and which makes him you know one of the 24 Elders I mean just like John John you know on the aisle of patmas when he was Saul in Revelation 5 the 24 Elders you know was always sitting around the throne he already knew he was one of the patri uh uh Apostle John was one of the one of the Apostles you know the 12 apostles and 12 Patriarchs and he saw the 12 and 12 sitting around the Sun John saw John saw himself there he said he's already there and the same thing about when brother B went beyond the curent of time he saw you there he saw me there he saw himself there we got to recognize we got we got we just have to recognize these things are true this has happened in our generation true he he saw me there he saw you there it's it's nothing we don't take lightly like well you know he had a transl out a vision and know a bunch of no no he he saw me and you there just like you have to you have to you have to really recognize I heard my name called brother man said you heard from theop when you receive the word of God God accepts your faith gives you the Holy Ghost you've heard from your theop you've got you have to AC we have to accept the fact that what he said that's what I am now let's go a little step further s in church age he said but we do know want to review our case for the first we all know surely that the purpose of God stands in election it was God's purpose to bring forth listen it was God's purpose to bring forth the people like unto himself predestinated to accept deity it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself and that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of world in him and he got in him in bold letters there again just what I said about you know Peter there at the foot washing you have no part with me not in me he couldn't he was in him he couldn't he couldn't deny that he couldn't throw him out but with me she was chosen before found in him she was for and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed to her blessed is a man whom God will not impute sin true I accept accept amen I accept now the first man was like now the first man was like unto himself in Genesis 1 126 and God said make let us make man in our image after our likess let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth oh how Satan hated that yes he did so God created man in in his own image God created man in his own image didn't create Lucifer In His Image God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created him them Satan hated that now you know what Satan hated one Genesis 1:27 because Satan's is jealous and he because see Satan Lucifer used to be God's right-hand man as brother B said had Fellowship With God all but a Creator iniquity rose up him in in Lucifer God kicked him out now he don't have fellowship with God anymore but God desired to have fellowship with man and Lucifer Satan hates that hates that just like Cain Cain was jealous of Abel because Abel's uh sacrifice was was received by God and because Abel had a revelation of what God's acceptance was Cain hated him for that and killed him for it the rest of the reason the world hates us because what we believe now God uh could not have would fellowship with man God would now have fellowship with man so Satan had to do something to alter the change destroy God's fell fellowship with man of course that was a false we understand that Satan fell listen God did nothing for listen when Satan fell God did nothing for Satan nothing but when man fell God did everything to redeem man he could care less about Satan he's he's here to do his job test man like brother B said in uh and uh not Godless evil age but one of the mess he said why why did God put us here in this age to be tested and tried amen not only not only he wanted to have Fellowship back with man but he wanted to dwell in man that's what God desired he want to dwell in man and God is a spirit God wanted to dwell in man but Satan wanted to Satan wanted to think same thing now listen here here's here's a real a real Stinger if you will in the Ephesian church now well I'll just read it so you'll understand God wants to get inside man and Satan wants to get inside man now listen to this now why did this have to be so theasian Church age why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple Satan has known this all along he also wants to indwell man even as God so does but God has reserved to himself that right Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan could not and cannot do that he does does not have created Powers the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in Eden even has he entered by evil spirits into the swine of gadera God does not enter animals but Satan can and will to accomplish his ends that's what he did with the serpent in the guard of Eden he could not have a child directly by Eve as did God by Mary so he entered into the serpent and then begal Eve he seduced her and by her did Satan have a child through Eve or vicariously he says Cain bore the full listen Cain Satan's first son Cain Cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and the animalistic sensual fleshly characteristics of the serpent that's Cain yeah and how why people say well Cain and Abel they were twins I mean you know what's this serpentin stuff like that well I mean come on I mean why did Cain have the nature he had Abel had a totally different nature while I was Cain jealous Abel had to write sacrifice uh Bible says you know uh all there's five or six scriptures that prove Ser we believe that Satan so he says Cain bore the full spiritual characteristic of Satan and the animalistic sensual fleshly characteristics of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked one so you see Satan entered into the serpent then the serpent did Evil just like Judas at the Last Supper Satan and the Bible says and Satan entered into Judas and he went to do what he was ordained to do I've well I don't W get into that CU another Ser why did I wonder how much really uh Judas knew I mean I know he was a thief you know he probably he stole out the treasury but I wonder if he really knew he was that one that was ordained to be the deceiver but anyway yeah so we now we want to expose Cain I want to ask a question who really was Cain this is where we want to kind of tile This Together who really was Cain Cain was the first incarnate son of the devil remember Cain was was Satan's son Lucifer's son Abel was Adam's son they had twins we know the story okay Adam was the first incarnate Son of God think about it and Cain was an incarnate devil man all that back at the beginning so I you know I got to thinking okay what about Incarnation what is it what brother M say about Incarnation and like in the second seal brother B said Jesus was the Incarnate God and Judas was the Incarnate devil and a man can be an incarnate devil true then I remembered what brother B said about Elvis Presley so I got that quote brother Ben says this in book of Corinthians and then even the ministers trying to up build that kind of thing and Elvis Presley saying yeah I trust God for all my success and how would a living holy God ever give such to vulgarity and a devil demonized thing that's absolutely been one of the greatest hindrances in this nation has ever been seen is a guy like Elvis Presley who sent who sent who sent millions of souls to Hell by his old dirty filthy rock and roll stuff sent millions of souls to Hell by Dirty rock and roll stuff certainly I don't have to apologize at all if you listen to this if you can believe me to be God's Prophet remember there is an incarnated devil absolutely he said it I didn't say it I'm just reading what he said right there Elvis Presley in our day an incarnated devil yeah so then another incarnated devil in our day so I got to thinking okay what Incarnation what is it what does incarnation mean what is the definition incarnation incarnate Incarnation very very interesting he says but dictionary said to be made flesh endowed with a human form inhuman form to provide with flesh or a body to embody to give actual form to make real that's incarnate Incarnation means endowment with a human body appearance in human form any person listen this any person or animal serving as the embodiment of a God or Spirit any person or animal serving as the embodiment of a God or spirit so you're telling me so if a person serves as a house for a God or a spirit that person is the Incarnation of that God wow that's that's a definition so we see Elvis He had he he his he provided the body for Satan to get into and he was incarnate devil we understand that it was a house it was a house that Satan lived in sent millions of souls to hell because of his filthy rock and roll so I got to thinking Judas was incarnate devil Hitler was and several of them Elvis was incarnated devil so that just didn't seem right we're going to have an incarnate devil in this Earth on this generation now what about the opposite come on they got to be an opposite somewhere there must be God incarnated somewhere we got find it somewhere we' got this generation if if you got the the evil there's got to be the positive you got the negative got to be the positive right I got to lay in right here before me amen so I got to lay right here endowed with human body to take on a human body remember brother saying this generation is a generation that the word will become flesh the word will be made flesh rising of the sun brother man sees bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life power of his power she is him amen can you accept that she is him I don't feel worthy she is him he declared it's more important you believe what the word declares you are than what you think you are yourself amen I'm unworthy I make mistakes my flesh is carnal many times I fall short I this I that I that forget it we're not talking about this sticky flesh said your flesh will be sticky till you get out of here we're talking about a predestinated seed we're talking about a gene of God we're talking about the very life of God what is the token what is the token the literal life of the literal the literal Life of Christ the token could only come in the evening time only come in the evening time no other time the only come in the evening time so brother B says Jesus said at that day that day is this day at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I in the Father the father of me I in you and you in me when the Revelation is made manifest made manifest at that day you should know that I and the father are one can you accept that I and the father are one I the father and the father of me then when the revelations comes forth and it's I and you and you and me there you are all that God was we could oh we just we can we can eat this one up all God was he poured into Christ part of what God was he poured into his bride didn't say that all that God all that Christ was he poured into his bride that's what he said can we accept [Music] that I believe now don't let this quote choke you second seal brother man said now but the age after the church goes home listen to this real closely but the age after the church goes home he becomes talk about the Antichrist he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate the red dragon himself oh my can't you see what I mean he's incarnated in his people then he's got his people Bound by this power the false prophet has prophesied them right into it giving them over the strong delusions to believe a lie and be damned by it denying the word in the form of Godless but now God on the other side God works his place in a trinity jusic sanctification incarnates himself in his people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost incarnates himself in his people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost incarnates himself and his people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you able to accept the fact that now you possess that part of deity I believe it incarnates himself but if you had truly truly I'm not talking about just being Justified just being Sanctified I mean there there's many around the message you know that's just walking in Sanctified I'm talking about if you truly have had a word birth and you know you born from above the whole your very life expresses the love of God you you make mistakes sure but your whole nature desire Focus everything about you is you love God you love this message that's it you know you pass from death and life then the Incarnation of God dwells in you that's the word of God that's what the prophet of God said to me that's thus sayith the Lord amen amen God works his place in the Trinity justification sanctification and incarnate himself in his people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same thing the devil's just a type the devil's just a type after Christ don't you love that the devil's just a type after Christ yeah he incarnated Judas he incarnated Elvis Hitler you name it he's only a type after Christ brother man also in the second seal now what Satan now what Satan when Jesus incarnates himself in his people the very life that was in Christ is in this person oh brother I could just I can just hug that I just I love this message it's our freedom it's our life it's our deliverance it's our Escape out of here it's our ticket to get on the plane oh now listen uh how long have I been how many more minutes I got um I'm about I'm getting close this I I I read I found this and this is really good this is a commentary wrote this but he really had some understanding and I want to touch on this just for a minute and then I'm going to close it this is very very good don't quit for I do this commentator writes this I really really I really love this he said the Incarnation God did the Incarnation God did not embody merely qualities and Perfections but himself how closely must the nature of man be related to the nature of God okay God Christ okay how closely must the nature of man be related to the nature of God for God himself became incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth it was through the points of similarity now I'm not saying everything he hears is perfectly right but he's got very very good understanding here it's through these points of similarity between the nature of God and the nature of man God became man see that the Incarnation of deity in humanity became possible he said now we revolt at the Heathen idea that a Divine being a Divine being can be enshrined in wood or Idol or stone we know that's that's that's false because there are there are no Godlike faculties in that wood or stone right because there are no Godlike fa faculties through which the the radiance of divine presence can stream forth on the Kindred faculties of the worshippers who are to be illuminated by that manifestation I mean that's a lot of words there but there there there's no similarities there amen can't you can't have a god wood or stone there's no similarities there there's just nothing there if man be The Offspring of God the the Incarnation becomes rational and credible man has some good understanding there so our first nature was not compatible with God we born in sin not compatible with God but our new nature is closely related to the nature of God I mean we could take a whole message have the mind of Christ and so forth and so on our new our new Nature has Godlike faculties and characteristics we eat on the word we love what God loves we hate what God hates I mean it's just we have those Godlike characteristics our new nature is his nature what is the token the literal life of Jesus Christ his nature is now in you he became me that I might become him that's right so now we're we're seeing in our first uh nature we come in this world we have no faculties that have Godlike characteristics before we have a nature change that's why Jesus said his first doct ye must be born again amen you ain't going to enter in you got to be born again you you can't have a hog nature you got to have a lamb nature you must be born again so I say if Elvis was incarnated devil then the bride is the word made flesh Christ in Christ in you the hope of glory listen friends this is the age of deity back in flesh deity person ified in flesh as I said what is the token what is the token tell it to me the literal life of Jesus Christ back in his bride full brother man said full obedience to every word of God entitles you to the Token token full obedience that's why he said next God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey that's right he don't give it to everybody he gives it to them that's predestinated to receive the Holy Ghost and them that obey so Jesus Christ incarnates him in his people by the baptism of the Holy Ghost how close am I five minutes 10 he you can't get anything out of him okay remember remember what I just read to you how closely must the nature of man be related to the nature of God think about that to the nature of God for God himself to become incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth for God in in God himself to be incarnate in his bride see he cannot he cannot God cannot dwell in an un see there's just so many aspects as we see right now I mean Luther he had he had a por a dip into the Holy Ghost brother say Wesley di Pentecostal is dip but now the full word is born of in station we have the full complete word of God God and we we we have come to the place of of I'm talking about real sanctification not that works is is is everything not that but God is not going to indwell a dirty vessel that's right not only just the dirtiness of the flesh we're not so much talking about that but we're talking about believing every word God is not going to dwell in people that don't believe every word that's why this is the only age that God desired this for 6,000 years that he wanted to indwell just like Satan wanted to indwell man God wanted to rewell man in this age and he's going to bring it past he has brought her to pass because the full word has been born in manifestation the bride receives a full word she's recognizing who she is she is a part of word she is a part of deity she's is Christ in you the hope of glory no other age could have been said she is that's why he said invisible Union you are now the pure spotless sinless Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you never done it in the first place what was the first what was the first place the first place was like Adam there was no sin in him at all you never done in the first place just like Adam praise the Lord before the fall you never done it you was trapped into it Hallelujah the Incarnation what does the Incarnation of Christ show I'll close and just second it shows this it shows our souls are dear to God he condescended to humanity to show his love inside he wanted to be inside his bride the Incarnation of Christ shows the high Destiny of man Christ in you the hope of glory god in flesh walking in SHO leather being birthed into Christ we assume the nature of Jesus Christ what does the Incarnation of Christ show it shows that our souls were intended to have fellowship with God Amen God placed his germ his seed there in our souls if we're predestinated that seed of God and every seed must bring forth the kind remember he said spoke word seed every seed has a potential to bring forth what it's ordained to bring and it's going to do that it's going to do it can't do anything else you plant mustard it's going to come mustard if you plant corn it's going to come out corn I don't we're not talking about hybrid stuff we're talking about what God's original seed is it's got to bring forth that God said he's going to have mature sons in day he's going to have mature sons in this day I accept I accept how many can say I accept I accept what else is the Incarnation of Christ show Christ Lord shows human beings were distinctly marked out for his dominion and His glory we we were made in his likess in his likeness rather Paul said let this mind also be in Christ we got to start thinking like God's thinks that's right truly I mean we and we're doing it we're doing it we're doing it the bride's doing it hallelujah what else this show God is becoming Humanity shows the it shows the recoverability of Fallen Humanity hallelujah hallelujah yes God didn't throw us away he didn't throw the mold away he didn't throw the Broken Pieces away he said I'll just make it over I'll just give him a new nature I'll make I'll bring him back that's what that's why that's why Resurrection is not replacement it's bringing that up that went down we're Fallen he bring us back up it's not replacement it's Resurrection oh thank God for that he became us that we might become him he is the only way back to Total reconciliation he is our Perfection Perfection is unattainable unless God dwells in us as a music musicians come I'm going to read you two or three quotes that be okay I'm going to do it anyway thank you brother M said listen to this says men and women it's time that we found out who we are did you hear that amen men and women it's time we found out who we are but I can say to you right now the bride is recognizing who she is she is the devil's trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little old trod down something you're not you're Sons and Daughters of God the deity is not in heaven where is it it's in you amen that's right no room for Jesus instead of going church they go to the shows dances everything call themselves Christians but brother when the deity of God by the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart it calls out everything that Christ has it created Hallelujah wow Bo I like that it just calls out everything why your whole focus is Christ it's Christ everything's about Christ we have nothing to do we don't love the world we don't go with the place of the world we have nothing to do with the world we live for God brother say a man is just a man is just a man until he's fully submitted to God and then deity dwells in The Man by the Holy Spirit not man but God in the man does the work amen oh we got we got hundreds Hallelujah listen when when brother BR went beyond the curtain of time as I said earlier he saw you and he saw himself there what does that tell me another thing is really interesting when brother Brown preached the preview of the Bride tells it tells it four or five different places and you know the story he saw the early church come in preview p and reviews we talked about you know beautiful nice church then he said now we'll preview the Church of America he saw ungodly filthy half-dressed naked led by witch he said if this is the best we've done to present a bride of Christ to you he said It felt so bad and he was just like you know what can we do I just you know then he said but the bride must preview a second time then she comes marching over the hill correctly dressed marching into the tune of owner Christian Soldiers she marches up the other marches down falls down but and my point of being that God gave brother bam that vision of the preview of the Bride yeah and what he saw was the last day Church in Step marching to the word everything correctly dressed long hair etc etc he saw the Church of America led by which undressed Unholy that was that was not brother bram's idea that was God's idea of the Church of America and the bride you got to understand that was that was God gave brother that that Vision true that that was you might as say that's thus sayith the Lord that's right that was true that's God's impression God's opinion of the Le oan Church filthy half-dressed naked miserable even uh you know Revelations 3 says that it's it's that's striking but then he sees the bride preview the second time that's what God thinks about us brother sister are we blessed are we truly blessed truly blessed can you accept that you're predestinated to how's deity I accept I I accept Amen brother Sean you got a song for us come up
