Well, aren't you glad for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And uh we're so thankful that [snorts] we have something that we can [music] stand by and that stands with us and we can defeat [music] Satan. Amen. On the on the grounds, Amen. of [music] any situation under any condition. Amen. God is so good to us. Amen. Well, good morning. It's good to be [music] here. House of the Lord and the musicians can be dismissed. [snorts] Amen. A beautiful [music] day today and um it's hard to believe that we're closing the end of the year. Getting close and [clears throat] and u man this year has gone by so fast. But that's all right. It just brings us closer to uh going home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um, um, if you have your Bibles, we're going to go to the book of Mark, the 16th chapter. And it's um, uh, good to have Sister Kim Weeks with us. Amen. And see that she is doing good. And, um, good to have Brother Terry and, Sister Alice back with us. and &gt;&gt; they're doing good. And &gt;&gt; so we thank the Lord for that. And Amen. And just uh good to have everyone as it's been said. Uh we just really thank the Lord for God u moving on Sister Martha's behalf. Amen. Causing that tumor to shrink. And I just believe it's going to shrink on down. And um you know we had had prayer for um a little a while back uh for her eye. It was turning bloodshot and um doctor says that she'd more likely she'd have a red spot. Is that right? A red in her eye permanently. But um they were showing me the other day it's just totally gone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh so we thank the Lord for that. You know, God just moves. He may not move in a thunderous way sometimes, but he just moves silently. And um and we we just thank the Lord. And you know, I believe God could have kept Sister Martha from even going through this, but he had a reason to do it. But and God loves to show his power. &gt;&gt; He loves to show that he's able to do anything. And he he just loves, you know, he just can keep the physicians baffled and uh and many times he keeps us baffled, you know, um but we just give him all glory and praise and um brother Joe's sister-in-law Sharon doing good and is her name Sharon or Shannon? &gt;&gt; Shannon. &gt;&gt; Shannon. I thought I thought that's what it was. usband. Um so Shannon and um I had just got a report I before I came up that she's off of life uh the breathing I guess life support I guess what that is and then um uh ventilator off the ventilator. She's out of ICU and um so that's a real miracle in itself. Um um it's kind of hard to explain what she had but um uh she was in a desperate situation and uh but we just praying and so we thank the Lord that u he's just uh helping her to recover and believe that she's just going to come out um fine. Praise the Lord. She's only 50 years old, I think. And so um uh but uh the Lord's just good. Uh just a reminder of service this evening at 4 and um be having testimony and song and so looking forward to that. And um also uh there's going to be different ones be going out of town this week for Thanksgiving. And so we want to keep them in our prayer that the Lord just uh keeps them. And um uh be no service Wednesday night and uh so we'll uh the Lord willing meet back u on next Sunday. And um anyways uh before we go into the word, may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord and as we know that we need him now more than ever before. and and I certainly want to rely on him. Amen. Father, Lord, we're so thankful that you've called us out of darkness. You've chosen us for this age. But Father, may we always be reminded that we're nothing without you. You've chose us. You've redeemed us, cleansed us, that you could work through us. Father, we just humble ourselves here this morning. and realizing our insufficiencies, our weaknesses. Father, we're asking Lord that you would overlook it all and that you would just come into this vessel and that you would speak to your people. And father that your spirit would anoint the people, Father, and any spirit that would be waging a war in their minds and trying to get them distracted or whatever. May you just come and intervene. And Father, may we sit in heavenly places here today, Lord. May we just uh bask in your presence and hear from you and that your word could be effective in our lives. May Satan be defeated, Lord, in every aspect that he would come at us, Father. And we see that victory is one. We ask it, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. So, we want to look at Mark [snorts] um the 16th chapter and um start at the 15th verse. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if any deadly if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay on the sick and they shall recover. Praise the Lord. Then Romans 1 and 16. Romans chapter 1 and um 16 we know it but um says [clears throat] for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God. Everybody say, "It is the power of God &gt;&gt; unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, the just shall live by faith." Amen. You can have your seats this morning. And um if I used the title commissioned to preach the gospel with signs following the believer. And the word of God um as we've been taught and we see it all through scripture, but the word of God is the best weapon uh that God could have given man. It's um it's the greatest thing. Um there Paul would tell us there in Hebrews 4:12, "For the word of God is is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, &gt;&gt; piercing even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and of mara, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. So, uh, the word of God, that's what the word of God is. It's a sword. It's it's sharp. It's powerful. It's it's something that, um, uh, we all need. And we, we have seen how powerful that word of God is in this age, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But God gave us the Bible um, in this age. Um, um, well, we've had the Bible for u many years. uh which is the word of God and we thank God for that. We have the written word. Um because the written word is is is just as powerful and because it is the word of God but it was given to us by inspiration. All scripture is given by inspiration. and um uh men of God uh wrote and and they spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And so, but then God gave us gives us his word through the preaching of the gospel. &gt;&gt; So, just having the Bible um is not enough. It's it's important to have the Bible. It's important to read the Bible. I um I think we should read it on a daily basis. Um reading the Bible and and never never uh letting that go. Uh but then God uh shows the preaching. It all works. It all works together. And [snorts] he gives us his word through preaching. Uh and and we know that God is perfect. Uh the Bible says God's way is perfect. As for God, his way is perfect. &gt;&gt; And so perfect means he cannot change. It's complete. It's it's something that is it is it is um he can't get any better. Uh he can't he can't diminish. He he can't it's it's just he's perfect. &gt;&gt; Uh kind of hard to explain perfect. Uh because when we think we've arrived in perfection, then we're always learning something and we will always do that. But God, once he makes a decision, that decision is perfect because he's perfect. His word is perfect. His his uh attributes are perfect and and things like that. So God chose man. He he could have chose the wind. He could have chose the son. He could have chose anything to preach the gospel. But he chose man. That's right. &gt;&gt; And as we know, the Bible says that God set within the church a five-fold ministry of pastor, teacher, prophet, evangelist, apostle, which is a missionary and and things like that. It's not that man can it's not for man to glorify himself as man has done. It's not that man builds his own kingdom. See how many followers he can get and and all that. That's God's design or purpose as as to why he chose man to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And but but the gospel is to deliver it's it's to deliver the the people from the power of Satan. It's to uh it's to bring that elect in. And we all were were bound un by Satan. We all were were in the pawn shop, if we could say it that way. We all were in in trouble uh and and left to Satan's demise and and things. But when the gospel came, Amen. then uh we're here today. &gt;&gt; Satan wouldn't have brought us here. I promise you that. &gt;&gt; Uh Satan wouldn't want us to believe the message. Satan wouldn't want us to come in contact with God and get closer to God and and these things. But it's because there was a gospel that was preached unto us. &gt;&gt; And so, uh God gave the church the gospel. And in there is the power to heal the sick. Uh raise the dead. Um uh in the gospel is the power to save and to deliver and and to set free. It has the power to cast out demons. and not only just to cast out demons, but it has the power to establish and to positionally place uh us in Christ. That's the preaching of the gospel. And uh so I'm I'm thankful for the gospel. And so when the gospel is preached, it will be effective to the believer. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And when the gospel is preached, anxiety will leave. When the gospel is preached, depression will leave. When the gospel is preached, I've seen it when when the gospel just by preaching the gospel, blind eyes come open. &gt;&gt; Uh uh crippled walk and not even having hand on them. Amen. And it's just the power of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Fear will leave just through the power of of through the gospel. And and so brother Brandham even talking he's talking about some ladies and and sitting there uh the the night before in wheelchairs. He said they heard the good news. They heard the gospel. And he says tonight their wheelchairs are not here. They're probably sitting out there in the audience somewhere. They were free. He said they were free all the time. Jesus cut them loose at Calvary when the bloodstream came from his body to free every person from sickness. See the sinners that accepted Christ last night was sitting bound last night under the chain of sin and tonight is joining the freedom of the Lord Jesus after they heard of the uh emancipation of the proclamation they are free. See so the preaching of the gospel set them free. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Well, I believe that the preaching of the gospel is still effective today. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and the preaching of the gospel. Now, we were sinners and we're not now. Amen. And I pray that all of us are in that situation today. Amen. That we were bound and now we're free. We we were addicted to things, but now we're free. And and and and all these things. But even then, look how the gospel is still affecting us. The preaching of the gospel is still working in our lives. So the preaching of the gospel isn't just for sinners. It isn't just for the sick. It's for every aspect of our lives. The preaching of the gospel. And so of course it's not going to be effective to everyone because not everyone is a believer. Ain't that right? And so and to be honest, there are more unbelievers than there are believers today. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And how I know that is you're looking around and and um um you know the gospel isn't having an effect on people like it's supposed to. Uh we have the best medicine that we have we have ever had. We have the best doctors than we than we've ever had. We've got the best hospitals than we ever have. And yet we got more sickness than we've ever had. And and uh uh brother Brown said it's because we have more sin and unbelief this world has ever known. &gt;&gt; And he says, "See, we got too many things that's got people's minds all tore up. Is this right? And is this right? And is that right?" And and and and people, sad to say, people even in churches are have got more questions than they have answers. Amen. So something wrong there. Ain't that right? Amen. Because the gospel is to be given answers, not questions. It's to give answers. And yet people have got more questions than they have the answers. And he says, "And the poor people don't know what to do." Ain't that right? Well, we're not part of that group that don't know what to do. Amen. Uh uh we have the answers. And so Jesus, the last commission that Jesus gave the church is preach the gospel. That's the last commission is go into all the world preach the gospel. Now the prophet says making the word live is the gospel. &gt;&gt; Making the word live is the gospel. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So now everyone uh that's baptized into the body of Christ has a part in this gospel. &gt;&gt; We have a part. And you may not be called to stand behind a pulpit and declare the word of God. You may not be called to be a preacher in that sense of being able to explain the word, but every one of us are called to live that word to to live a sermon. So, so you're not maybe not standing here like I would be today preaching a sermon, but you're living a sermon. You got a sermon, &gt;&gt; every one of us. And that's part of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and and so there is power in your sermon. &gt;&gt; Because you are living out the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's not the man that has the power. It's the word of God that holds the power. &gt;&gt; And whether the man is preaching a sermon, if it's the word of God, there's power that is coming forth. Or whether a a man or woman is living the sermon, there's power in that. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't know about that." Well, Brother Brown or or Paul Peter talks about you w the wife and and and he's also, I'm sure, talking uh to the husband as well. But 1 Peter 3:1 says, "Likewise, you wives be in subjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the lifestyle &gt;&gt; or the conversation, the life, the sermon that you're living. They could be one by that." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This is why brother Bram says, "How we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices, the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness and purity, undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish." Yes, sir. Real Christians, that's the thunder against the enemy. The devil don't care how loud you can holler. The devil don't care how much you can jump and how much you can do this OR SHOUT. WHAT HURTS THE DEVIL is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God. Say anything to him, call him anything and he's just as sweet as can be and move right on. That throws him away. That's the thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Another place, Brother Brown said, "Let your sermon be lived." Everybody say, "Let my sermon be lived." Let our sermon be lived. &gt;&gt; See, it's the voice of God that'll bring reproach to them who reject it. They say, "No man, no one can put a finger on his or her life. They're sweet living." See, if there's, if there ever was a man of God, it's that man or that woman. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Another place, Brother Bram said, "Let your life be your pulpit." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, that's powerful. Let your life &gt;&gt; be your pulpit. &gt;&gt; There's there there are some MEN THAT ARE CALLED TO STAND BEHIND A WOODEN pulpit or a pulpit AND TO PREACH THE GOSPEL, but every one of us, our lives are to be our pulpit. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So now, if you're not called to teach the word, to preach the word, explain the word, don't try it. &gt;&gt; That's not your call. &gt;&gt; Don't don't try it. Brother Brandon says in talking to the pastors, he says, "Remember your ley sometimes tries to explain things and do things. It's best that you instruct them not to do it." YEAH. &gt;&gt; IF SOMEBODY WANTS to know something, let them the one that's instructed to do it. You see, say, well, now, like somebody would say, hey, I tell you, they tell me you over at your church, you believe in eternal security. Now, you better watch. You'll probably get in a bigger mess than you ever was in and make him worse off than ever. See, trying to explain that. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, he said, "Say, I I tell you." So, he's tell Now, this is what you're supposed to if you're not to if you don't know if you're not called to explain it. Say, "I tell you, uh uh tell you what, if you'll come over and ask our pastor, see, you go talk to him." See, that that is true. I know our pastor believes that. I believe it also, but I'm not able to to support. I'm not a preacher. I just believe it. That's all I know. I believe it because I've heard it him explain it so out of the Bible that it WAS BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF DOUBT TO ME. BUT SEE, better let the leoty speak to the pastor about that and the pastor be sure HE KNOWS HOW TO answer it too. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so so we all have our place, but yet that does not diminish the importance of our part in the gospel. &gt;&gt; If if that makes sense to you, &gt;&gt; THE GOSPEL IS TO be lived. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? This is why Jesus would say in Matthew 5:16, "Let let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Let your light so shine. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY? THAT'S PART OF THE GOSPEL. YOUR LIGHT THAT'S SHINING. THAT'S THE SERMON THAT YOU'RE PREACHING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PULPIT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A PULPIT EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; WHERE THERE AT WORK, YOU'VE [screaming] GOT A PULPIT. YOU'RE PREACHING BEHIND YOUR PULPIT AND THAT'S YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? [cough] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon says there's many people won't take time to read the Bible, but they'll read you. &gt;&gt; That's right. You are [snorts] a written epistle of God. A real true bornagain Christian is the word expressing again. See, say that again. You are a written epistle of God. A real true bornagain Christian is the word expressed again because your written epistles of God read of all men. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You think of it. Now, I'm just preaching to a a a a certain group of people here this morning, but when you go out them doors, your life, you're preaching to MANY PEOPLE, &gt;&gt; ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PREACHING TO ATHEISTS. YOU'RE PREACHING TO uh uh UH UNGODLY PEOPLE, BUT YOUR LIFE IS THE SERMON, BUT YOU'RE PREACHING to elect out there just as much. That's right. that elect COULD BE SO UNGODLY AND SO ROTTEN AND AND AND BOUND BY SIN AND BUT YET YOU'RE PREACHING TO THAT INDIVIDUAL BY your life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? [snorts] And so uh he says there there there's um what type of a person should we be [snorts] if we know that our lives is an open living Bible to the unbeliever &gt;&gt; to express God in our own life. Say that again. If we know that our life is an open Bible, open living Bible to the unbeliever to express God in our own lives, then what type of person should we be? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. We We don't We don't want to feed off things that we shouldn't feed off of. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to feed off of him &gt;&gt; that he could be PLEASED AND WE COULD HAVE IN CONTACT WITH HIM, RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. YEAH, SIR. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Um, you know, sometime we get too busy condemning one another and talking about one another. But I want to ask you, what good is that going to do? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham said, "Don't condemn the sinner. Have mercy on him. &gt;&gt; Let him go ahead and smoke his pipe. Let him drink his liquor. Let him have his card parties. That's his pleasure. Don't blame him. coming home and everything tired and wore out. He wants some pleasure. The thing for you to do is live such a godly life &gt;&gt; that you can prove to him that the gospel holds 10,000 times more than that for him. &gt;&gt; That's good. You see why we live in lives, we got to live that life to the people is it's easy to talk. &gt;&gt; You take you take a a person that gets disgruntled with someone in the church or just gets gruntled with the church and before you know it, they'll [snorts] go out and it's it's the center way to do it. You know that it ain't a Christian way. It's the center way. They [snorts] go out and they start talking running their mouth about someone in the church. [snorts] And of course their their point is, I need someone to talk to. Well, ain't that funny? You got 10 people to talk to, right? Talking to this one, then then then you're talking to this one, and then you're talking to this one, and then you're talking to this one, and and to me, it's selfish to do it that way. Amen. [snorts] Because a lot of it is is your own fault. you know, you you got a lot of problems in your life and instead of repenting and humbling yourself, you you're finding avenues to point fingers and and and and all these things. But what good is that to do? Let's if a person is wrong if you literally seeing that this individual is wrong with whatever then then this holds just as much as importance as it is to the as as our as it would be to the sinner that brother Brand's talking about. Won't we live such a life before the individual that you've got your issues with? Won't you live such a life before them that you can prove to them that the gospel is 10 millions times stronger than their situation that they're that they're in if if they're if they're if they're in pornography live such a life before them that they can see that pornography is nothing compared to the power of the gospel. If if if they're if they're if they're hypocrites, if they're LIVING IN SUCH A A shame and and you see it, WON'T YOU JUST LIVE SUCH A LIFE BEFORE THEM THAT THEY CAN SEE THAT THE GOSPEL HAS 10,000 10 MILLION TIMES THE POWER, AMEN, TO HOLD A PERSON THAN IT would be for the lust or the the entertainments and for whatever issue. Can you say amen? IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOSPEL, YOU AIN'T CHANGING anything by running your mouth. You're not changing anything. Amen. By tearing that person down. Ain't that right? You You're not You're not tearing You're You're not changing anything. What you're doing is you're destroying the church. You're destroying that individual character. You're just ruining your OWN SELF BECAUSE GOD ain't going to put up with that. God doesn't want none of that. Can you say amen? See, and and and so THEN THEN LET'S GET BACK TO THE [screaming] GOSPEL. WE WE AS BELIEVERS, we as Christians, amen, should understand and HAVE THE THE FUNDAMENTAL REVELATION THAT IT'S THE GOSPEL THAT HOLDS. IT'S THE GOSPEL THAT DELIVERS. IT'S THE GOSPEL THAT SETS FREE. IT'S THE GOSPEL. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. IT ISN'T JUST WHAT I DO. IT ISN'T. I WE CAN TRY TO FIX THINGS, BUT LET THE GOSPEL FIX IT. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's the gospel. We're told to go preach the gospel. We're told to live the gospel. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I hope that's all right. &gt;&gt; But notice Brother Bram says the very message of the gospel itself, now this is the message of the gospel. All right. Amen. The very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The very message of the gospel is to prove to the people he is risen. So when your sermon when you're living a sermon and you're and that's your pulpit, that's what you're living is the gospel. You're you're living that word out. Well then then you're showing to the people that he is risen. when when when when we're preaching the gospel, the message of the gospel is he's alive. Can you say amen? Amen. HE'S ALIVE. [screaming] WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO A CHURCH THAT DON'T that and and never experiencing the risen savior. NEVER UNDERSTANDING THAT GOD IS ALIVE AND WELL. &gt;&gt; OH, I hope you understand. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen. Go tell my disciples that I am risen from the dead and I'll meet with him to confirm this to them. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So Christ isn't dead. He's alive. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; He's not a tradition. He's he's not a theory. He's not a god of history. As we have witnessed, we have found out that he is the same in every detail. He's the same in every detail that he was back then. Same in attitude, same in power, same in authority, same in action, same in thought, at every detail. And as the prophet said, we are beneficiaries of his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; We are beneficiaries of his life. See, in other words, his life, we're not just talking about a a Jesus Christ the 2,000 years ago, BUT HIS LIFE HAS COME UPON US. NOW, we are to prove to the world he is living in us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? WE'RE NOT POINTING THEM TO SOME SPIRIT OUT THERE, SOMETHING UNKNOWN, AND THEN WE JUST GO BY FEELINGS AND and Oh, I feel that, you know, and you know, all that. No, he's a living reality IN ME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE GOSPEL TO PROVE TO THE PEOPLE he's living. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And if you know the scriptures, you know that God has a body. &gt;&gt; So, we are to prove that his life is in us. See the prophet says he was the Messiah because he was anointed with the fullness of God. Then we everybody say me. &gt;&gt; WE are anointed too &gt;&gt; with the same spirit. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So Romans 8:11 says, "But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies." SO, WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A SPIRIT OUT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SPIRIT THAT HAS COME IN US AND [screaming] QUICKENED OUR mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To quicken means to make alive, right? &gt;&gt; So, but notice if you're quickened, you're not quickened or you are quickened by another man's life. You're not quickened by your life. You were born of your natural birth. So you you come into church, you come into the altar, you come whatever because you've already have a life in you. &gt;&gt; That's your life. But then to be quickened, another man's life came inside of you. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; See, if if a life of a dead man is projected in you, let's just say, you know, I die today and and you see my body, my corpse, it ain't moving, ain't nothing. You say, "Oh, he's dead." Well, cuz the body ain't there or the ain't in the I ain't in my body. [snorts] But what if I were to come into um I don't know, what if I were to come into brother Bill? What if I were to come into your body? And then I was able to possess and have preeminence in that body over his life. My life, my spirit was to gain preeminence over his. Then brother Bill, you would no longer be you. I would be you. I would reflect myself. What I reflected in that body now I would refct you. &gt;&gt; Right? So you'd be more talkative. You'd be more honory. [laughter] You'd be coming behind the pulpit preaching because my life is in you having preeminence in your body. Whatever I am was in this body, now it's in you. &gt;&gt; Right? So it's the same person just in a different body. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So then if if the spirit of God literally lives in us and it is a literal happening, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; the literal life of God dwelling in that individual. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; How many's got the life of God living in you? &gt;&gt; That life of God living in you, then what does it do? If he can gain preeminence in us, &gt;&gt; if he can gain preeminence, &gt;&gt; then he lives himself in us. &gt;&gt; Then the same Jesus that was back there is living today. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And that's the gospel is to prove that he lives. &gt;&gt; Not living in a story. NOT KEEPING HIM ALIVE like they say. We're going to keep, you know, uh, uh, Kirk, is that his name? Kirk, that just got assassinated. Keep him alive, you know. Well, they can only keep him alive through stories and and in the past and keep reminding the people and showing videos and all of that of of of Kirk and and and and these things. See, but that's not what we're doing here today. We're not keeping Jesus alive by Christmas pageantss and and Christmas plays and nativity scenes and and and Easter uh plays and and all of that. Ain't I ain't talking against all that, but that's not how we keep him alive. &gt;&gt; WE'RE KEEPING HIM ALIVE BECAUSE HE'S IN US. &gt;&gt; WE'RE PROVING TO THE WORLD HE'S ALIVE BECAUSE HE'S IN me &gt;&gt; and he's able to have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; That's the gospel. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:27, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he is the quickening power. In John 6:63, Jesus said, "It is the spirit that quickenth." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, no wonder Jesus said in Matthew 21:21, "Verily I say unto you, if you have faith and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea, it shall be done, and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing, you shall receive." Can you say amen? Why? Because it's no longer you. &gt;&gt; It's it's Christ in you. The same voice that spoke in that body and spoke to that tree is the same voice in you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's the power. I I I pray that uh I'm not being too scattered uh this morning. [snorts] &gt;&gt; We find that the church is to carry on the same life that Christ lived. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the church is the body &gt;&gt; of Christ on earth today. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the essence of the gospel. Same character, same power, same authority, same everything. Well, what was Jesus manifested for? The prophet said to show God. That's what Jesus was manifested for is to show God. He was God. Ain't that right? He was the visible image of the invisible God. And the PROPHET SAYS THROUGH THAT purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the preeminences preeminence in the church the position his place. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; His place in the church. He says Jesus was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made. He was God's revelation. &gt;&gt; God revealed. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; God was able to express every move or God was able to be expressed in every move Christ made. See, now Jesus knew who he was. And the prophet says, "Now he's sanctified with the spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this was God's purpose. First of all, that he might be revealed in Christ. Be expressed in Christ. Secondly, that he might be revealed in his church. Expressed through the church. Can you say amen? God expressed himself in Christ. NOW GOD EXPRESSING HIMSELF in the church. All that God is, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ is has BEEN POURED INTO THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so then you know if if a man doesn't have this experience of Christ being in him, then whether whether he's preaching a sermon behind a a pulpit or in even in his own life, then his proclamation of the gospel is only theoretically. It the gospel becomes just a theoretic thing. If a man really doesn't have that Christ in you, that that really substance, that quickening power within them, then the gospel is a theory. It's theoretically uh declared. See, and and so then all he can do is talk about the resurrection of Christ in a theoretical way. You you understand what theoretical it's it's it's saying it's not really it's not the reality of it. we're just going to pretend like it is or we we're just going to give a scenario but but it's not really that you you know what I mean? And and so uh uh so so when he talking about the resurrection instead of being able to prove that resurrection he's only talking about it as a theory as as theoretical it you know and and so he can only proclaim that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. He has no proof of that because Christ ain't in him. Amen. He has no proof. SO HIS HIS SERMON BECOMES theoretically can you say amen? Theoretically is according to an idea or assumed set of facts or principles. Nothing is based on evidence or experience. So he can only present the word in a way of theory, hypothetical, speculative. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Because he HAS NO EXPERIENCE OF WHAT he is saying. So many uh uh men are getting behind pullpits and and THEY'RE PRESENTING THE GOSPEL IN A WAY OF THEORY. IT'S JUST SPECULATIVE. IT'S NO EVIDENCE. HELLO. &gt;&gt; NO EVIDENCE. I AIN'T GOT EVIDENCE. I'D HAVE to take you all the way to, you know, uh to to uh um uh Israel to have some kind of a proof, you know, a physical proof. But I ain't got time TO TAKE YOU. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. WE'RE NOT TO TAKE EVERYBODY TO ISRAEL. WE'RE JUST TO PREACH THE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AND TO PROVE BY THE GOSPEL THAT IT'S ALIVE AND WELL. &gt;&gt; So I'm not to preach in a theoretical. &gt;&gt; I'm not to live my life in a theoretical. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? [snorts and clears throat] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray God just opens that up to you. But we are ambassadors of Christ. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; We are ambassadors. So, brother Brandham says, "Now listen, I think this is a powerful statement. If we come representing his ministry powerfully and the death of the Lord Jesus, then all heaven is behind the word." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? IF YOU COME REPRESENTING JESUS, your sermon that you're LIVING AND THE SERMONS THAT US MEN ARE PREACHING behind the pulpits, if we're preaching it in a powerful way, in a in an by an experience, &gt;&gt; by conviction, then all heaven is behind it, [snorts] &gt;&gt; how did they know that he was the Christ because he proved what he talked about. &gt;&gt; How do we know that we are beneficiaries of his resurrection? Because he proves he proves what he has talked about. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Signs and wonders are God's way of proving himself. Amen. That's what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He proved that the children of Israel were his people by vindicating them with signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so signs and wonders goes with the gospel. The word living goes with the gospel. It's part of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; There was Moab. Moab uh a nation and and they had a prophet just like Israel had a prophet. They were as religious as Israel was religious. They had the same sacrifices as Israel. They had the same altars as Israel. They served the same God as Israel. But God vindicated ISRAEL &gt;&gt; WITH SIGNS and wonders. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? GOD VINDICATED THEM. GOD KEPT [screaming] THEM. GOD PROTECTED THEM. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And it's just like today. There's the spiritual church. There's the formal church. both fundamentally teaching the Bible, serving the same God, believing in the same fundamental things of the Bible. But the prophet said, "But God proved he was with Israel by signs and wonders and supernatural." They had the pillar of fire over them. They had the divine healing among them. They had the shout of the king in the camp. Can you say amen? They screamed and act like maniacs. They danced in the spirit. They done signs and wonders. They healed the sick. THEY HAD THE SUPERNATURAL following him. See, AND GOD WAS SAYING, "THIS IS MY ELECTION." &gt;&gt; THROUGH SIGNS AND WONDERS AND VINDICATION OF THE SUPERNATURAL, GOD WAS SELLING THE P THE WORLD. [screaming] THIS IS THE ONE I HAVE PROOF OF. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ONE THAT'S MINE ELECT. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's what the gospel means to us is when it's confirmed by signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Oh my. May we depend upon the supernatural. May we believe with all of our HEART THAT THE SUPERNATURAL IS WITH US AND FOLLOWING US TO WHERE WE DON'T have to do it. WE DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT OUR OWN BATTLES. LET GOD FIGHT YOUR BATTLES. &gt;&gt; LET GOD [screaming] DO IT. LET GOD ANSWER BY FIRE. &gt;&gt; HE'LL do it. I promise you &gt;&gt; he'll do it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Because we're preaching the gospel. Now, we don't follow signs and wonders. That's not what the Bible says. We are not to follow signs and wonders. Signs and wonders follow the believer. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And so, all we're doing is believing. And signs and wonders are following. Now, there is nothing more powerful than the gospel. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Nothing more powerful than the gospel. Amen. [snorts] But power apart from the word of God isn't of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Say that again. Power apart from the word of God isn't of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My word is spirit and life." &gt;&gt; Amen. The words that I say unto you, they're spirit and life. So then the word, the prophet said, is the conductor of the spirit of God. The word is the conductor. See, the spirit follows the word and it makes the word to live. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; This is why we should never be in a hurry to get out of services. Now, I understand we're all human and and in in these things. And but I I do think that sometimes we get in in in a schedule. We and we put God on our schedule. We we think that well, you know, our whole life is based on schedule. We get up at a certain time. We've got certain things to meet and and do and we got to do this all in a certain day and and all that. And then when we come to church, we've got we're putting everything on schedule. You know, we want this done and we want this done. I got to go do stuff. So, let's go. Let's kind of get to moving. And what we don't realize is the gospel is the greatest thing that you could ever have in your life &gt;&gt; because in that is power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the word goes forth and then the spirit follows the word &gt;&gt; and it begins to move and it begins to work. And you know I've got children that need the Holy Ghost. You you parents have children that need the Holy Ghost. there. There's maybe some that need just a word from the Lord just or maybe a refreshing from God and and a renewing or maybe there's problems and situations that need to be fixed and and all these things. See, and and you know, I I love the way that uh uh brother Ray Ericson, you know, established his church, taught his church, and that was, you know, they'd have, you know, they sung their songs and and and and had the word and all that, but then when they dismissed, the entire congregation just sits down instead of rushing out the doors, they all just sit down and they just begin to sing and they're just waiting upon God. And you know uh uh uh and and a lot of time maybe not every time but a lot of times there's people start to come to the an altar and maybe some getting saved and problems getting fixed and things like that and then gradually one you know they just start drifting out you know slowly just quietly but what what is they're waiting he's waiting on the spirit of God the word's gone forth and the prophets taught us that the the spirit follows the word of God. And if we would come with the expectation that hold it, I'm not hearing the word of a president. &gt;&gt; He's got power and he thinks he's got a lot of power, but not not not powerful enough for the word of God. His word doesn't match the word. And yet we come in to pre UNDERSTANDING THAT GOD has ordained MEN TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND AND AND and the signs and wonders ARE GOING TO FOLLOW THIS. AND IF WE COME WITH THE EXPECTATION, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE need of. IF YOU JUST SETTLE DOWN &gt;&gt; AND AFTER THE WORD, ENTERTAIN THE WORD WITH YOUR PRAISE. ENTERTAIN THE WORD. DON'T LET [screaming] THE DEVIL GET YOU IN A HURRY. &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT GOD ON A TIME CLOCK CUZ GOD WILL NEVER MEET YOUR TIME. &gt;&gt; You'll never be able to put God on your timing. &gt;&gt; As we all know that God works in his own timing. &gt;&gt; THERE'S TIMES THAT GOD WILL HEAL INSTANTLY AND THEN THERE'S OTHER TIMES THAT GOD WILL wait for months and years then all of a sudden come down and heal. &gt;&gt; God does it in his own timing. So don't ever TRY TO BOX GOD IN. &gt;&gt; What I am saying is wait upon the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wait upon him because we have this we're conscience and we have this belief and knowing that the spirit follows the word of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; [cough and snorts] &gt;&gt; And and and [clears throat] so the gospel is not just word, but it's the gospel. The gospel is the word being made manifest. The word made manifest. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, when the word is spoken, then it is manifest as it was in the beginning. God said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; And then light appeared. Why? That's the gospel. God was showing us how his word works. The word goes forth. The spirit follows the word. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and and I hope I'm making some sense to you, but there's times that you you some of you got your children that are wewarded and and all that. Maybe you don't know what to do, but you you understand you living the gospel. your your sermon being preached, &gt;&gt; your your sermon proving to them. They may not say nothing to you. They may not act anything and they may act contrary, but you're proving to them that that that Christ is risen. &gt;&gt; You're proving to them that you've got something that'll hold them. Amen. And and that something that you've got is more powerful. is millions times more powerful than what they're looking to to hold them. &gt;&gt; You're proving that that word is being min ministered unto them. THEY MAY NOT BE COMING TO A CHURCH. THEY MAY NOT HEAR A PREACHER, BUT YOU'RE THAT PREACHER. &gt;&gt; Your life and church, you've got to live with with with a a confidence that the spirit of God follows that word. The spirit of God follows that word. I'm not doing this in vain. the spirit of God. If that word is in in me, if that's the voice, it ain't just a voice, literal voice. It is the word of God being lived, the prophet said is a voice. &gt;&gt; And if that voice is being proclaimed by your life, then that voice has power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the gospel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the word was spoken by God himself, and he believed his own word, and it came to pass. And I won't keep you much longer, [snorts] but Mark 16:20. And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "Signs &gt;&gt; follow the word. Salvation follows the word. &gt;&gt; Healing follows the word. Deliverance follows the word. Victory follows the word. It all follows the word. The word goes forth and then victory comes after. &gt;&gt; Life comes after. &gt;&gt; Demons are cast out after. Can you say amen? Why? There's power in that word. Satan can't stand the word. He cannot withstand that word. His power is broken when the word comes forth. And that's why Satan hates you so much. &gt;&gt; He is trying to break you down. He's trying to destroy you. Because the more you become the word and you're living that word out and your sermon is being lived out, Satan is doing everything to rock you to destroy you. Amen. Because there's power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that's what shakes the the devil. That's the thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So signs follow the word. Remember when Elijah went to the widow of Zerapath, first Kings 17 and 13, this woman was in dire need u uh uh drought and she was in bad trouble and she had gotten to the place and brother Brandham, you know, Brother Bram could describe a scene very well, but she'd [snorts] hear her son crying and you know things like that and she had tried to console him and and all that but she was faithful to the Lord and [snorts] then God sent a prophet down her way and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me therefore a little cake first [snorts] &gt;&gt; see and bring it unto me and after make it for thee and thy son &gt;&gt; for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the crus of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah, and she and he and her house did eat many days, and the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the crus of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah. Can you say amen? See, so when she did as the word told her, then the miracle came. &gt;&gt; Then the proper sign as the prophet said, the proper sign came. See, so he says, "Come to the word first, then watch the miracle." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See? So, so why is the preaching of the gospel so important? Because the word comes first and then the miracle comes. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; amen. Now, &gt;&gt; whatever you have need of this morning, &gt;&gt; my God is able to give it to you. &gt;&gt; And we should be as people, we want to be a people very sensitive to the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; We want to take the services of importance. I know it can become tradition. It can become ritual just Wednesdays, Sundays, and we're doing our thing. But never let it get to that place &gt;&gt; because the word has power &gt;&gt; to meet your need. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't care how what what situation you're in. I don't care what situation it is. The word of God is able to meet your need. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If you can just believe, that's the that's the thing. Just believe. A amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the word of God is uh it's been set aside today. What is the word? Jesus said, "Thy word is truth." Thy word is truth. So truth is part of the gospel. Thy word is truth. And notice John 8:32 Jesus said, "And you shall know the truth, the word. You shall know the word, and the word, the truth shall make you free." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Peter said in one place that the people were established in present truth. &gt;&gt; Which I think that something to us in this day. But notice now the the effect of the word. Ephesians 1:13. In whom, Paul says, in whom you also trusted after, everybody say after. &gt;&gt; That you heard the word of truth. The gospel of your salvation, in whom also after you believed, after you heard the word of truth, you believed. After you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise. See what the preaching of the word done? &gt;&gt; It sealed them. They believed it. It was the word of truth. They believed in that word of truth and they were sealed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The gospel has been misrepresented so much today to where people don't know what the gospel is anymore. And to many, the gospel is just about singing and music. We've got, you know, churches today that are many, you know, are are leaning to professional singing groups to, you know, asking them to come in and take the services. And they're holding concerts, you know, on on service times. And then then comedians are becoming a popular thing in service where they're taking the Sunday morning service and oh they minister a little word here and there and in between the jokes and the comedy. Live animals are being brought into the church for illustrations and to help keep the people's attention. You got your professional choirs and professional musicians paid and coming into the church to entertain. But none of that church is going to produce a bride crop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; None of that's going to produce a bride crop as we see. We we've I mean as as as they're bringing these things in, you know, they're letting people are getting more wordly. uh to where homosexuals, lesbians, and transgenders are coming into the church, having prominent place in the church. &gt;&gt; Ain't that sad? &gt;&gt; Having prominent place in the church, adultery, people living in adultery, just sitting in the church and not feeling no guilt, no nothing. just living with each other, preachers even getting, you know, getting caught. It It's become a rat mess, you know. It's just a But see that that that that will never make the word live. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You You can't bring a comedy and and make the word live. &gt;&gt; The place has the church has become entertainment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, but brother Brandham says this, "Preaching the word is the acorn." &gt;&gt; So, preaching the word is the seed. &gt;&gt; Making it live is the gospel. &gt;&gt; You can't have the tree without the seed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, God forbid that we ever have a gathering in a church setting and then the people you leave without having a seat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't want you leaving without having some seed. The word seed. &gt;&gt; So the preaching is the seed. &gt;&gt; And and and and I may be stretching it, but I believe it this way. If your life is the sermon and you're living the sermon according to the word and you're reflecting that word, then you're giving people a seed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're giving people hope by your life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Because you're living a sermon. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So they may never hear me, brother Will, to preach. They they they don't they may never they may never even read a Bible, but the prophet said, "You're the Bible &gt;&gt; that they'll read." &gt;&gt; So you're actually giving them a seed, &gt;&gt; and they'll see hope by you. They'll see a living Christ by you. They'll see that there's something different than this world by your life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and that's what the gospel is. &gt;&gt; Preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Preach the gospel. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come, [snorts] &gt;&gt; we never want to underestimate the value of the word of God being preached. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Trust it was a help to you today &gt;&gt; and something that we take home with us. And may God help us all to live that word. Amen. &gt;&gt; To become the word &gt;&gt; and to come under expectation for the supernatural. because I just believe it. I I believe it as we've been seeing it, you know, in Sister Martha's situation. I believe we'll be seeing it in Sister Rhonda's situation. I [music] believe, you know, we're seeing it in in Shannon's situation. I just I [music] believe we're I believe we have that right to look for these things, not to be cast down. [music] And when we hear bad news or we get bad reports [music] or bad whatever. No, that's not the gospel. We are We've got the gospel. We've got the word of God and we hear the word [music] of truth. Can you say amen? Amen. What song still moves [singing] in the heart of believers? [singing and music] God still moves.
