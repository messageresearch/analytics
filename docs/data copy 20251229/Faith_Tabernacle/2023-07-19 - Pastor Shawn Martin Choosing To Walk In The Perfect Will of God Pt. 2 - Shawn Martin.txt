then the next day she's hurting real bad on the other side and the next day she was just couldn't even hardly walk in her back legs and I just prayed over the first day and I'm like I can't go to the vet right now and I'd rather just leave it in the Lord's hands because he's better at helping than any vet could be anyway I had to that's before we went out of town and by the time we came back she's she was perfectly fine and hasn't had an issue since I thank the Lord for watching over all things he cares about it all hmm father I see that you were drawing a Line in the Sand I wanna be standing

over every situation give me the words well aren't you glad that we have the word amen the word the Bible says Thy word is a Light lamp into my feet a light into my path amen and we're walking in the light amen well it's good to be here the musicians can be dismissed and be good to have everyone here and good to have Dalton is it nice to have you this evening and um and uh Mark again with us praise the Lord and um uh just all the home folk and I trust you had a good day today nice day and wasn't as hot as yesterday so this is a plus but uh good to have brother Andrew and sister Mariah back home amen and um only just for a brief brief uh moment I guess and uh be heading out and preaching there in Tennessee this weekend but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Colossians the fourth chapter and we were praying for sister Rhonda and sister Lisa's sister and um but I heard that she has actually able to make it home I come back home and doing well and so we thank the Lord for answering the prayer amen I just believe that God is a prayer answering God no matter what it looks like no matter what in the impossibility God can answer the prayer seeing him do it time and time again amen a man um before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord and ask for his help Father we come to you as your children with Humble Hearts Lord we're needy people father we're not self-sufficient Lord we we need you Lord we need you in every part of our life father we've seen you answer the prayers we've seen you protect and deliver and set free and God you provided in so many ways and Lord if you've done it back then you can do it now again and I pray father that every need here present whether physically mentally spiritually that they would be mad Lord father we would give you all praise and glory for it and we pray Lord that you would just bless the ministering of your word father your word is already blessed but now we just pray that you would help us the speaker and the hearer and may your word Lord just be effective in every life we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen Colossians the fourth chapter we'd read this last Wednesday and it I'm not good at the pronouncing these names but everpus something like that which is one of you this is Paul writing to the Colossians this this brother who is one of you a servant of Christ saluteth you always laboring fervently for you in prayers and notice that you may stand perfect and complete in all if I say all the will of God you can have your seats this evening and uh I guess again I'm going to use the title choosing to walk in the perfect will of God and I pray this will be of some help to you and especially to you young people who are at a Crossroads in your life and um standing in the the will of God perfect and complete is something that we should all desire from the eldest to to the youngest who I guess who who can pray in in accordingly but we know that the will of God is the plan of God for our lives and it's a it's not just a random thing but it's a predestinated plan and so we we realize that it it this plan is off based off the purpose of God which Paul would tell us it's an eternal purpose and it's a it's a predestinated plan and God's plan God's purpose uh existed before the foundation of the world and and only God could do this but if we could call it millions and millions billions or whatever of years if there was such a thing uh before creation this plan was in existence in God's mind and we talked about I think it was Sunday the premeditated thoughts of God and and so we we look Isaiah 46 and 9 God speaking through the prophet Isaiah says remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure calling a ravenous bird from the East the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yea I have spoken it and I will also bring it to pass I have purposed it and I will also do it ain't that right so then uh uh and I'm so glad for the predestinated plan of God a man that God could uh foreordain everything and and then we we find that that the way that God how that God could predestinated the plan is by his foreknowledge that he doesn't have a mind like you and I we don't know what tomorrow holds we can plan for tomorrow but we still don't know what it holds uh our life might be cut short tonight amen and uh uh so many things can change our plans but God has an infinite mind that that he he can tell the end from the beginning and he can declare it he knows what will be ain't that right now I want you to listen to that he knows what will be so just reading some some quotes here um God foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters and he predestinated them to be there ain't that right see God could predestinate by foreknowledge he foreknew what would be not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance but being infinite and God he could predestinate and foretell by foreknowledge ain't that right this is what this whole Bible is is a foretelling of the future of things that would be and what will come and and well that was God he spoke through prophets but it wasn't their mind they didn't know they didn't know how a lot of things like Isaiah would say Behold a virginship and say well how in the world is the Virgin going to conceive never been done before but but Isaiah wasn't going by what he thought or what what he he saw in in his own natural ability that was God speaking through that man so it was an infinite god with an infinite knowledge declaring what was already going to be and it happened just exactly the way he said it would be so it wasn't a man's words ain't that right so God knew now notice by foreknowledge God knew exactly who would be saved and who would not be saved see so as we talk you know uh we're going to the marriage supper of the lamb and and and and there's a table going to be there right and and and and and so we're all going to be gathered around this table but but it isn't God now saying okay now I wonder who's going to make it you know uh uh boy that guy's really going through a lot of troubles right now and I he I don't know you better hold that chair right you know because I don't know you know and then you see someone just backslide I just scratch his name out you know there ain't no hope that ain't God he's you know it's it's not taking the chair adding the chair taking a chair you know what I'm saying well God already knows who will and who wouldn't see and and so uh he knew exactly who would be saved and who would not be saved he didn't want the people to be lost it's not his will that any should be lost it's his will to save everyone but he knew from the beginning who would and who would not that's the reason he could foresee this thing will happen that thing will happen or this will be that or this person will be a certain way see he could for know it because he's infinite and if you don't know what it means that means there's nothing that he don't know foreign there's nothing he's infinite he knows how many heart at times your heart's going to be during your whole lifetime brother Billy knows how many heart how many times your heart will beat by the time you're born to the time you die and not only just you but all the billions of people on the Earth and not just to humans but the animals and the birds and and on and on and on he's infinite so he has that kind of knowledge there's nothing that can escape his his knowledge so way back in in the beginning uh another quote when he's seen that there were some people who was going to desire to be saved some people who was going to want to be saved some people who would be loyal in their heart they wanted to be saved see he saw that he knew that so then he began to make preparation for their salvation or they will never be saved ain't that right so so he knows that anything in perfect cannot come into heaven see and and yet he knew that there would be a people that if given the chance they would choose to go to heaven they would want to go and so therefore he has to make a way of perfection for that ain't it ain't that right he made a preparation for healing he made a preparation for victory he made a preparation for deliverance he made a he made a preparation for the translation of their body amen and and he knows how many is going in a Rapture they're they're he already knows that and and and not only that he already knows who's gonna who's gonna be on the other side and and so that's why uh uh uh it's not a body that will be made when you get there that body's already waiting for you well that's what Paul said see if this the Earthly Tabernacle of this uh body be dissolved we have one waiting ain't that right see so now now those who accept his provided way are the sons of God for they have the gene seed of God within them they are the very attributes of God they are the Eternal thoughts of God that's what it means to be father ain't that right if father's got to have sons and and they come from the father they that there's a gene seed within them that is of the father they look like the father act like the father think you you see what I'm saying and and and so their their attributes of the father sons and daughters are attributes of the father and God is our father so to claim that God is our father is to say I am an attribute of God I am a gene seed of God I came from God ain't that right and so then uh uh uh they are the ones that God called and well Paul talks about it we've read it many times them he he predestinated and those that he predestinated he called and then he called he justified and then he justified he already glorified ain't that right and so he's already made a place for them in glory ain't that right so by foreknowledge God knew the one that would be a shyster and the one that would be a gentleman and a Christian see so therefore he had to send Jesus today I have to save that man that he foreknew that wanted to be saved God done that he he already acted not upon you but he acted upon what he already knew ain't that right so so another one a quote is God before the foundation of the world looked down through the stream of time and saw everything that would be therefore he could call and elect those who he knew uh that he would put uh in his building so so this purpose God has a purpose again for for everything now now this may be a striking but it's true uh uh there but but uh we know that there are more people on this Earth than just Sons and Daughters of God ain't that right we we know that and and yet this fact doesn't come by surprise God God knew that they would be here ain't that right and and so the only way though that they could come was through the fall of Adam ain't that right see the only way they couldn't have come by the spoken word because they were not a word Gene ain't that right and that's why they don't receive a new birth now I I let's just get it down now because the world Paints the the picture of Christ today that is a defeated Christ that he went to Calvary and he and he and he gave his life and he done everything that he'd done and and exhausted himself and yet he's being so rejected today and it just looks like his purpose for going to Calvary is defeated but it's not defeated ain't that right God's got a purpose and and and so therefore God come to redeem those that he foreknew would accept that so so we find that that not everybody is going to be born again not everybody can have the new birth there's only a slight group of people that can have a new birth and that was them ones that were to come in the original by the spoken word of God now now notice the new birth uh for just a moment First Peter 1 and 23 and I'm just laying something I'm going to get somewhere but being born again not of corruptible seed uh uh but of Incorruptible everybody say Incorruptible by what the word of God being born again not a corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever so that's where the eternal life is is the New Birth by the word of God can you say Amen see so so we find that that that there is a a multitude and this is what the Bible speaks of it it it only does not only just speak of of the Bride amen but it speaks of The Sinner and the ungodly appearing before the Judgment thrown and it it it it talks about the foolish virgin as as well as the wise version which we know the wise version is the bride of Christ and but yet there is that foolish virgin and and and it speaks of the friends of the Bride in in Matthew 25 and where where they're at the the the white Throne judgment and and and and and God would say to them because when I was naked you clothed me when I was poor yeah yeah you gave me uh uh uh uh food or when I was hungry you gave me food when I was thirsty and they said well when did we do all of these things he said when you've done it unto the lease of these my brethren you did it unto me ain't that right see so there's there's all kinds of people that this Bible talk talks about but there's only one group of people that God that come from God that are sons of God Amen that can be reborn again ain't that Ryan so so we we find that that none of all this none of this uh uh catches God by surprise you realize that God knew that that uh the the the the the the the the angel uh Lucifer you realize that God knew what he would do and what he would be before he created him God knew that ain't that right but God went ahead and created him because it fit in his plan God knew what Pharaoh would do and what he would be before he even created pharaoh before Pharaoh ever come to this earth God knew what he would be and yet God would allow him to come into this Earth and be what he was because it fit in God's plan and you say man well God could have said well I don't want uh you know in his in his foreknowledge he could have he could have saw this if I if I if I allow pharaoh to be born this is what he's going to be this what he's going to do this is the nature and and and and and I I could sin my Prophet to him and and give him the message of the hour and he'd refuse it reject it even though I do sign so he could have said well I'm just going to scratch that idea I don't want a pharaoh as such a man as him to be ever be born that God allowed him to be born to fit his plan ain't that right well look at this Romans 9 17 for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth and yet Pharaoh never accepted God he he never amen surrendered his will to God but yet God knew that God knew he wouldn't do it and yet he would have him to be born come into this Earth set upon the throne amen just forward the sole purpose that God's power might be magnified so the actions of Lucifer never caught God by surprise God already knew what would happen God knew what Cain would be and how he would be born and yet he permitted it to happen he knew that Cain would not accept the Revelation that Abel had ain't that right so so we find that God purpose within himself he purposed within himself to save Mankind and he had a plan as to how he would do it ain't that right but yet again he knew that all men would not accept his provided plan ain't that right but he could have stopped it from men from from rejecting him by not letting them be born that he allowed it to happen ain't that right God purpose to to give man a protection not not guns not weapons not not like that his protection would be his word ain't that right it's protection but yet he knew that the majority of people today would turn it down ain't that right yet he permitted them to be born anyhow anyway so to fulfill amen his plan it was all in his plan you see as we've been taught there has to be a contrast between right and wrong there has to be a contrast between good and evil there there has to be a contrast between light and darkness the truth and the LIE honesty and deception all of these things and and what it does is Darkness magnifies what God is because he is light ain't that right amen we we would never know God we would never value what God is if we hadn't experienced the darkness in our life we we would know the the protection of God if we never needed that protection we would never know God as a savior except we needed to be saved so God had to allow these things he permitted man he permitted he created the devil knowing what he would do he would tempt Eve he created Eve knowing what she would do ain't that Ryan now notice uh uh Paul says in First Corinthians the 11th chapter and 18th verse first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must be everybody must be also heresies among you that why why what's must there be heresies among you that they which are approved may be manifest among you ain't that right so the make-believer shows the unbeliever ain't that right amen defeat shows victory everything is a contrast it's true amen so division has to come just to show up to Unity see things prove the people as to what they are ain't that right so so there there had to be somebody a man when Jesus come to the Earth amen now the Bible says he was foreordained the lamb slain before the foundation of the world so he was already predestinated for ordained to be the Lamb of God when he came to this earth he had a Ministry well there there had to be people on the Earth that would believe him as the Messiah to accept him as as the Messiah but then there also had to be a people on the Earth that would crucify him ain't that right for it was already declared that he would be crucified he would die and he would take our sins as our substitute ain't that right so see there's not one person who has been on Earth or is currently now living on Earth that is not fulfilling the plan that God has for them the devil Works according to God's plan do you realize that so everything that happens in our life is according to the plan of God it's true The Good The Bad it's happening for God's purpose we go through sad times we go through happy times we go through through great times lonely times we we go where we're up on the mountain then we're in the valleys and and and and it seems like ours our life has more than four seasons and and yet Romans 8 28 says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the cold according to his purpose ain't that right so if the devil's bothering you it's still working for your good if you're going through a valley it's still working for your good if you're going through a time of loneliness and you don't understand and everything just seems to be caving in it's still working for your good because God's Got A Plan he's got a wheel and believe it or not sunny days ain't always just part of the will of God cloudy days rainy days the sun helps to crop the rain helps the crop and you got to have both days ain't that right So the plan of God if I could set this way the plan of God includes everyone in some way or another now the the prophet of God taught us that God has a permissive will and a perfect will and and uh uh the the permissive will is something that God has permitted to happen permitted to be but it is something that is only temporary you with me see so most everything that you see in this world I'd say 99 percent of the things that you see in this world or abide the permissive will of God see the world and its condition is permitted by God but it's only temporary this world's got to fall apart it's got to see civilization as we know it's got to Cease the politics have got to come to its end everything is coming to its end it was permitted by God but it wasn't to remain ain't that right the trials that we face is permitted by God but it's only temporary you realize our sinful life was only permitted by God but it's only temporary man the sacrificial lamb of the Old Testament was was permitted by God but was abolished when the true lamb come it was permitted but it wasn't the main the the main purpose or the the the perfect will now I I will say to you today we are coming can you repeat that with me we are coming to the perfect will of God that's why the world is shaking that's why politics is is is is is the way they are that's why the governments the Nations everything is shaking the way it is I mean Paul even told us there uh well God says not only will I shake the the the heavens I'll shake the Earth also and and there's going to be a great shaking and that which can be shaken will be shaken and that which we can we can will remain which shall remain and and so that which remains is the perfect will of God and and and politics is not in the perfect will of God our automobiles are not the perfect will of God everything that we have according to science and education and it's it's brought us a long ways but it's not the perfect will of God actually those things are killing us faster it's making us weaker it's it's making us more sickly the kingdoms of this world is of the devil and that's what he says that's what the devil said uh to Jesus at Mount uh not Mount Transfiguration but the uh temptation when he was tempted for 40 days he said all these kingdoms belong to me amen God's God's perfect Kingdom God's God's perfect desire will for a kingdom is not fussing and fighting killing one another can you say Amen amen and and the thing is is people want to hold on to these things they're wanting America to keep lasting and and I'm glad to be an American I'm I'm not anti-American but I'm telling you what the Bible says it ain't it ain't just America it's it's all the world we're going to change and not just that our bodies for in for corruption cannot inherit corruption there's going to be a changing of our bodies sickness is is a permissive will of God and you say Amen uh uh uh trials and headaches and and all of these things that we go through Temptations It's it's only a permissive will of God to work something within us and to show what God really is so we're coming to the perfect will of God not what God permitted that what God ordained now most people hate the perfect will of God and and I have to say it because it's because they weren't ordained to it and and I'm going to use this scripture and and I I think it's applicable but Paul would tell us there in First Corinthians 13 that which is done in part shall be taken away when that which is perfect has come there's some things that have to be done away with and and and and and you can you say well that's that's out of the context of what Paul is saying I'm telling you well everything about us that is temporal has to be done away with and can only be temporal or done away with when that which is perfect is come and you say man and we know that which is perfect is here and he's going to change it all back to what he wanted it to be in the first place and that's what's in our soul is Desiring for the perfect will of God to be done if not we just go pick it like everybody else does if not we just get into big frenzy like everybody else does on the on politics and government and all of these things but we're not worried about them things Jesus said when you see these things and begin to see these Saints lift your head up your Redemption draweth nigh it's the perfect will of God coming now are are we just robots that that do as we're told that's computed in us no sir according to the Bible we're free moral agents ain't that right meaning that we have the right to choose and what we want to do and what we don't want to do and and we may even call that a right but I call it a responsibility that is weighed Upon Our shoulders it's laid upon us and and we read this scripture last Wednesday Deuteronomy 30 and 19 God says I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessings and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live ain't that right so we've been set on free moral agency and that's the way it was with man in the beginning Adam and Eve they God told them what to do and what not to do and then gave them the choice they had to choose what what they would do now it's not that God didn't know what they would do but yet they had to do it they had to make it ain't that right so God didn't make Eve do what she did he didn't make her do it but he knows she would do it ain't that right so she had to make her choice between God's word and Satan's lie two reports what God Said and what that serpent said ain't that right and of course she chose what the lie and walked in God's permissive will the Rich Young Ruler was given the choice uh to sell all that he had and to follow Jesus Jesus himself gave him the opportunity he had the choice man we know what what he did he made the choice not to do that and yet the Bible says that Jesus loved this man he loved this young man and yet he could not tamper with the choice hello so see being a free moral agent you can take an attitude against something or you can take an attitude for it something it's just like God can send a gift to us uh uh but it depends on what attitude you take towards it God sent his son to be a gift to the world ain't that right well we find that that the woman with the issue of blood in her mind in her heart she said within herself if I can just but touch the hymn of her garment I shall be whole doctors she had tried doctors she had spent all of her money and she only grew worse she said if I can touch them if I can just touch the Garment I don't even have to he don't have to touch me you don't have to see me you don't have to say anything to me you don't have to have a vision of me or anything if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment that'll do it for me and she touched the Hem of her garment and she received her healing now the Roman soldiers slapped him in the face touched him spit upon him and he did not get the same virtue he didn't feel nothing that that woman did with the issue of blood it's the attitude that they took toward him then you say man see so so he had done Miracles and he had done this and he had done all kinds of things Jesus did but the Bible says he went into one town in his own town I believe it was and and did not one miracle see it was their attitude that they took toward Jesus ain't that right see so we find that God is not making us do anything that we don't want to do people are not made to go to hell people are are not made to sin man is not made to sin God doesn't make us live in sin and and and I'll be honest the devil doesn't make you live in sin either you're a free moral agent if the devil can make you do something then you're not a free moral agent and you say man many times we blame the devil for our sins but you cannot blame the devil brother Brown said this could you imagine Noah going up and say well perhaps I'd better build me an ark because it might rain no the word of God was revealed to him why if he had just took it like that see the first golfer come by and say well look at that little old holy ruler well he would have thrown the whole thing up and said my let's quit see that's the way people do when you say I started that the devil made me go back he says the devil didn't make you do that you did it yourself people backslide and the devil didn't do it they did it let's just face it now so everyone that comes to God has got to be tempted and tried do you believe that and and and and you young people realize that now you're going to be tempted and tried not every part of your life is going to be sunny days now you know to where you're just feeling so great and feeling like a Christian feeling on top of the mountain like I'm gonna make it there's gonna be time that you're going to be so discouraged so low and everybody ain't gonna be patting you on the back but you got to be have that for everyone that comes to God's got to be tempted and tried ain't that right but see a a real believer that has heard the word of God he recognizes it to be the word of God and then acts upon it and you say man people claim to have the Holy Ghost and yet live so worldly and they say well the devil made me do it but you know the Bible says in Ephesians 4 30 it says grieve not the spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption what SEALs you the Holy Spirit ain't that right the spirit of God seals an individual a man to the day of their Redemption seals them into the body and seal means that you are what secured now just say bear with me now the seal means that you are secured it's to your uh uh uh uh destination ain't that right so the Holy Spirit cannot be broken brother Brown said see you you all heard me say that people say whether the devil made me do this no the devil didn't do it you just wasn't sealed in so calls when you're sealed in he's sealed out and he says now you went out to him he couldn't get into you because the only way he'd get into you is come to the same process that you have and then he'd be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost then he'd be your brother ain't that right so he says you just went to the borderline come back less than for the things of the world he never went in all the way over into Canaan across Jordan the death to itself ain't that right now just in the natural uh uh because that we are free moral agents nobody no nobody can make you uh maybe be a bad analogy but we'll say you know make you eat the food you want to eat my my little ones might attest to that I don't like broccoli but I gotta eat it if you're driving down the road and and and there's no one that can tell you you know you you you go here and you go to this certain restaurant and and you uh you eat there no what what these companies do what these restaurants do what is they they have these Billboards they have these uh TV commercials they have these radio commercials they they do everything they can to influence you to turn off that exit and go to whatever McDonald's or whatever they make it so appealing that you would choose never been a time that I was forced by gun to walk into Outback so all they can do is entice you so to influence your decision I have you know I go if you go to the fair you go somewhere like that or the where the food vendors are I like going you know where the food vendors are because there's such an aroma and it makes you hungry and you're like man you know I don't know if y'all have I haven't uh but you walk out of the restaurant and you're full but there's another restaurant and there's smell that smell that they're cooking is just rifted right drifted right under your nostrils and ah that smells good well you know it's it's a something to entice but you know and you come under that influence and and you know if you you know you I gotta make note we got to go there again we got to go there sometime or forget it I'm going now you know and and and you you know someone's well but the price is high who cares it smells good man you know but but what they've done is they've been able to channel that to where it calls you to choose to code to their place well then I've also been you know place you know where you smell that and you're like man that smells good and the next person beside you you're like that is nasty and and they get sick brother Andrew and and you're like why man I mean so but it makes them walk away so so what I'm saying is free moral agency got in intended for this to happen and and which means that the devil cannot make you do something that you don't want and God does not make you do something that you don't want hello see but it's whether or not each one can influence you to choose now I'm just going to keep on going here but in your first birth you are a sinner because Adam represented you ain't that right you're born in sin you're Renegade to start with in every one of us and we could not help ourselves so the question was asked how are we ever going to be saved we're already Sinners because Adam represented us we had no choice in that matter ain't that right but then the prophet says but Jesus Christ came to receive represent us before God as Sons and Daughters of God and he sent the holy spirit that is now brooding over the place trying to bring us back to birth to die out to ourselves and be reborn again to Sons and Daughters of God to take God at his word and to believe God's word so see in your old birth that that sex Birth by your your parents you you were born a sinner and and and and you were a sinner by representation ain't that right but it's in your new birth that you have a representation by Christ that your new birth is greater than your old birth your old birth was just temporary he was a sinner but that was temporary God didn't see you as a sinner in his mind God didn't plan for you in his perfect will to be a rock no good scumbag but he permitted it that he might be your savior not just your father your savior your Redeemer your healer your deliverer so God would permit this thing can you say man but I'm telling you right now if God Saves you he doesn't want to look at you as a sinner and if you're ever sealed by the Holy Ghost you can never be a sinner again you're sealed and you say Amen you're sealed so in your new birth you're a Christian by representation in Christ the second Adam now Paul calls him that I believe the second man Adam see the first Adam represented you and you're a sinner because he fell but the second man Adam come and he never fell and he went to Calvary and he paid your debt he was representing you I didn't have the choice as to how I was born or how I was when I was born we didn't have them choices God made us the way we are ain't that right he gave us our own personality gave us our stature he gave us whatever it is so we are what we are in our natural birth without a choice maybe some have a problem with lying maybe some have problem with rebelling maybe some have a problem with temper whatever but that comes by your natural birth sinful nature but notice what what brother Brown says if he made me what I am without having a choice and yet I was made in God's image and brought forth yet through a sinful act that God permitted to be done a her uh a a a perverted act by holy wedlock from mother and father if the spirit moves me or Woos and we come back and say yes we make our choice yes great God you made me and I loved you and you're my Creator and I'm sinful and I'm ashamed of it then he places in me eternal life then if he gives me eternal life by me answering back to his call the choice see and made me what I am without having a choice how much more can he raise me up after I've made that choice and field been filled with the Holy Spirit see the holy spirit is God's own life and you can know no more lose that life than God can lose himself why because the life that he imparts to you is an eternal life but that life is imparted by the choice you've made you don't have the choice about the nature you had when you was born in your natural birth but when he come wooing you said come to me you made that choice and he gave you his own life you can never lose that life can you say man it's an eternal life I trust that we've all here have made the decision to accept Christ as our personal savior and that we've all received the Holy Ghost and if you haven't you you you must be born again you need the Holy Ghost more than anything in your life you need the Holy Ghost because that's the Seal of God upon your life and that's the approval that's God's showing his approval of your faith in him amen the Seal of God but a man that is saved doesn't have to get saved over and over and over again a man that is filled with the Holy Ghost doesn't have to keep getting the Holy Ghost to make sure that he's not lost I understand there's the refeeling of the Holy Ghost and we all need that but it does not make you more saved than the first one if you genuinely got the Holy Ghost that's the seal God sealed you and as the Bible says then you cease from all your labors you've entered to God's rest which is an eternal rest but having said that spiritual growth is something that we all have to have and we all must want is spiritual growth and if you've received the life of God within you then that life must grow ain't that right and and I I will I was talking to uh Mark the other day and and I was explaining to him a little bit we talked about it before here but when when a mother is Mama is expecting a child she's got life within her different than her own it's it's a it's but it's it's a a body that is growing that mother begins to take on different appetites different things and and and and things that she used to like she doesn't like some of the things that she's never liked she's beginning to like now developing a taste she's craving it and it's not mama that's craving it it's that body within her that's craving for this life or craving for these things and it's it's calling it's not calling out for something foreign it's calling for things that were already there what it's made of and it's developing and it's got to have these things in order to to to to to to develop correctly ain't that right well see that's that's that life but but it's a body and and and so now the the the body that that little baby is forming but it's living off the life of Mama but but when we're born again we receive another life that's within us ain't that right we see receive another life that's within us and then all of a sudden we start craving things that we never crave before we we start Desiring things that we never we never had a desire for we start liking things that we never liked before and what is it it's a life it's not the body like the baby and the mother of her womb it's a life it's the literal life of God that is developing within this whole body then you say man but it's an eternal life and the things of this world is foreign to that life so it starts craving something eternal craving a a new body craving uh uh a fellowship with God craving a place where we'll never die never get sick never get old again something that is craving within this whole body [Music] Say Amen so see that life calls for growth it has to grow is that right in in order for it to grow now you're faced with choices every day something that maybe if you were relaxed if you're just a sinner you were more relaxed but all of a sudden there's something in you just ain't gonna let you get get content with life here in this world something within you that just keeps craving but you got to make choices and you say man for me to think that because I chose to accept Christ as my savior and he filled me with this Spirit based off my choice that that's the only choice that counts that's wrong can you say Amen now now and and I won't keep you much longer but Matthew 16 24. it says then Jesus said unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me now this wasn't this didn't happen just when you got saved and then that's it when you gave except to the Lord as your personal savior then that's it you're not just coasting now well I got filled with the Holy Ghost so I just coast and happy go lucky we just do anything we want to no no no no that's not true hello that's not true you got to take up your cross everybody say I gotta take up my cross now notice this he takes up his cross and follows now cross is a symbol of death and agony now the prophet says he that will be a Christian let him strip himself of his own thoughts let him strip himself of his own works let him strip himself of everything denying himself and take up that consecrated cross and follow daily daily ain't that right so every one of us has to follow daily if we're going to serve God and we've made that choice God I'm going to serve you I give you my heart I don't want nothing else because you've got to keep making them choices in the prayer that Jesus taught us to pray in one part it says we pray thy will not my will be done but thine be done in Earth as it is in heaven ain't that right and and you gave your heart to the Lord filled with the Holy Ghost but that doesn't complete all God's will in you hello so we we find that God now we we find we're wanting to know God's will there's something that is craving to know craving Desiring to walk in God's will I I just can't be happy go lucky anymore he used to be happy-go-lucky if the friends want me to go here I just went just have a good old time can't do that no more something's in me calling something else I'm becoming more heavily minded I don't understand everything but something's calling ain't that right see so so then you're you're you're you're bought with the price something that life has now possessed your body let's change your desires change your motives changed everything ain't that right we live in a day where where where where uh I don't I can't remember what kind of a generation this is Generation X GX GC whatever you know whatever anyway these Millennials is that it did I get it right millennials but we're living in a time of happy-go-lucky no responsibility we don't think about choices who cares about choices live like now you know and and and you've got you've got these young people destroying I've been reading where they they go to a gas station and and hundreds of them and they'll just sit there and just break glass and Rob and Rob and take everything out and who's gonna catch them they're they're they're becoming absolutely out of control video game life is worthless to them you understand what I'm saying they feed on video games they feed off this no responsibility take out the trash what is trash don't tell me what to do why do you go to school to learn what trash not only needs his mom or dad tell you what it is kick you in the city and go do it but we don't have responsibilities today yeah everybody wants to think for themselves and be what they want to be and no one's going to tell no restrictions but when you're filled with the Holy Ghost that stops because God takes over from there and you say man now God has to show us his will so that we can know what it is now if you're when you're filled with the Holy Ghost you start Desiring God I want to know your will something then you is you're wanting to know I want to know I want to know and and we find Paul says as it is written I didn't write the the scripture as far as where it's at but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them that love him but God has revealed unto us by his spirit for the spirit everybody say the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God can you say man now the will of God is written out in his word you believe it the will of God is written out in his word but it's hidden to the unbeliever to where he cannot see it but in this day God has revealed it to us through a Vindicated prophet and and I I I'll say it this way we have found out that God's will for our lives in every every aspect of Our Lives is found in here one thing that this message does to us it tells us look to hear you don't have to have psychologists you don't have to have marriage seminars you you don't have to have Bible Seminary or training and counselors and you don't have to have all of that we have the answers God's will for every situation in our lives is written in the scriptures you name it there it is for your marriage for your family for your church for your ministry for you as an individual over employee employer running a business everything it's all found in the in the word of God and you say man but his will has to be a personal revelation to us and then we must choose as to whether we're going to walk in it or not ain't that right now now something I I do want to say this is in the Old Testament the children of Israel asked for the law but they had a different reason for asking is is they wanted it so that they could do something to inherit God's favor to Merit God's favor it was a it was it was on the basis of God we we can do this we got to handle don't you worry about it and we want something to do with we didn't want it they didn't want to accept God's grace they didn't want to accept God's unconditional Covenant they wanted something else so they've done it by their own works and they did the law but they did not obey it from the heart ain't that right so when the testing times came they rebelled against the word of the Lord when troubles come they they they they complained and they griped and they argued when God would send them through things and temptations and when they ran out of food amen they start complaining when they run out of water they started complaining when everything began to complain and to gripe and all of these things see it was not done from the heart ain't that right they grumbled about their choices you mean I got up you you mean I got to follow that you mean I got to go all the way out through this Wilderness why why didn't we go through the why didn't we go through the Bahamas just to get to the promised land and you know what their reactions were and what they said we added better in Egypt 400 years of slaves And yet when the Trials come we had it better see they obeyed not from the heart that God God promised and I didn't give you this scripture but Ezekiel 36 26. he made a promise saying a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you in heart a flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that I gave your to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God so God was looking for a people in his plan he knew that there would be a people that he would bring to himself and he would pour His Spirit into them and they would it would cause them to desire him and notice it was after the day of Pentecost that Paul would say you were Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you can you say man so even though we have made the decision to follow Christ and have received the Holy Ghost it does not make our everyday decisions easy amen I think of often times that God shows us his will to us and down in our hearts we know what he wants and I'm speaking to you young people now he knows we know what he wants because there's something in us that it tells us don't do that do this do this we know it but then yielding yielding to that is hard for us to do and I'm speaking to Holy ghost-filled people that's I'm referring to that I mean we know the sinner is just rebellious I'm talking about holy ghost-filled people we struggle sometimes to yield to God's will you say man we are Sons and Daughters of God children of God and we are children of obedience if the world is called by the scriptures children of Disobedience and God's children are children of obedience but it doesn't it's not a cakewalk there's the struggles because our carnal nature does not want to submit to God and we all we all deal with the carnal nature can you say Amen The Sinner and the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost does not do away with our Humanity it does not do away with our carnal nature we have a human nature from our first birth we all know that nature carnal he wants to have its own way he wants to lie steal cheat Rebel and and all of these things it cares nothing about God or the will of God ain't that right it only seeks to please Itself by fulfilling the lust of the flesh Romans 8 7 the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed cannot be it can be see so so we are finding out today that the Human Nature has no boundaries as to how far it can go in sin homosexuals transgenders murders left and right I mean I mean even children that that you'd never thought possible and yet look what's happening it's the human nature that Satan is working through can you say Amen and they have nothing to stop it they have nothing education can't stop it well anyways I ain't gonna get into all that but education science stuff can stop it only one thing you see but the Holy Ghost Field person has another nature living within them and you say man you still have that human nature the brown said as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again with God's nature can you say man see in the Holy Ghost is the nature too and it feeds off the word of God ain't that right and so we have this warring within our members as we talked about where where it's it's that human nature that carnal nature and and and and and God's nature and they're warring together we read you know where program talk about the old Indian chief just got converted and someone asked him how are you doing Chief and he said well me good and me bad and he's like what do you mean me good and me bad he's well is ever since I got converted I got two dogs fighting within me a black dog and a white dog and he's just constantly fighting one another and they asked him so well Chief who who's winning he said well it all depends which one I feed the most ain't that right so and brother Brown said how true that is he says it just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God ain't that right and the world has been feeding off that carnal nature the things of the world man can we go on and on Hollywood with their television has has been the inspiration behind these maniacs because they feed off of it they feed and feed and feed ain't that right but see being that we are free moral agents we have this warring that that is within us it causes this warring within us but if you have the Holy Ghost you have the ability everybody say I have the ability to take God's way if you've got the Holy Ghost you have that ability don't note you've sat there and say well I can't help it you can help it just make the choice nothing happens overnight you know it you read about someone killing themselves well how's that setting to you it didn't happen overnight you'd been feeding them thoughts you've been thinking about things Satan been working on him ain't that right well I'm going to tell you right now you're not overcoming overnight it ain't just going to be a miracle that happens the Rapture just ain't a miracle that happens you gotta think about it you gotta dwell upon it you gotta feed upon these things can you say Amen can't just sit there and watch television and get waste your life away on the movies and the video games and the cussing and the swearing and the and the filth and the bars and the and the hunky Tonks and the sex and all of that and then all of a sudden you're in a Rapture that ain't gonna happen you got to make your choice and every day you follow to take up your cross see the perfect will of God is coming and there's a people on this Earth that are saying thy will be done amen thy kingdom come life will be done in earth in me God's will must be done in me in the will of God is done by us making that conscience choice God I forsake the world for you I forsake my negative thoughts I forsake my unbelief for you just like tonight you're hearing one report but you'll go out there and you'll hear others you can sit in a church and you can hear that God Is A Healer and then you go out and hear what the doctor says there's no hope for you it's what choice you wake it's what you believe and what you decide to believe you can go around saying well doctor says I ain't going to live so you can go lay in bed and cover yourself up and just wait to die or you can take God in his word and says no God says he's the god that healeth all my diseases it's the choice you can either live and defeat or you can live in Victory you understand what I'm saying and and so the nature of God is within you crying out for the will of God to be done in your life but it does not take away the responsibility of you choosing if if you allow me to read this scripture before we close Romans 6 and 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof see you you fulfill sin by your own lusts and then lust has got to die can you say man the Holy Ghost does not you have in the Holy Ghost does not take away that that them things Temptations and all that that's how the devil's able to tempt you is is Through The Human Side the passions and all of that when you say man so neither yield you your members as members of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield everybody say yield yourselves to God as those that are alive from the dead in your room your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin I wish I could just have a time to preach it but sin shall not have dominion over you sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid no ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey how do I obey them how do I become a servant to sin yielding how do I become a servant to God yielding can you say man you yield that to whom you yield your servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be think that you were the Sinners Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered to you uh being then made free from sin you become the Servants of righteousness can you say Amen all do you love the Lord I believe if a man has received the Holy Ghost then he will make choices to serve the Lord according according to his word can you say Amen yes sir I I just believe that and and so you have people that that that that that that receive the holy or claim to have the Holy Ghost but totally reject What God Says in his word and and you can't I I believe that the choice that a man makes tells what he really has inside of him can you say man so we we look at these things and if the musicians will come the Bible says John 16 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will lead and or he will guide you into all truth God doesn't feel someone with the Holy Ghost based on chance saying well I'm going to give this person my spirit and give him a try and see what he does he gives you the Holy Ghost because he foreknew what you would do hello Bram says before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew that you'd be wanting it and he chose you himself he said he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus any of you was on the earth and He sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to sin the Holy Ghost to you to bring you to himself the trouble today I find is that people don't guard their choices they don't take much stock in as to the choices they make they want to do it they do it they don't they don't and if we're not careful we can take predestination the wrong way you see predestination does not force people to be what they are and to do what they do again every man woman boy or girl has to make their choice [Music] then you say Amen and your everyday choice to walk in the perfect will of God triumphs over the enemy it's a slap to the Devil's face in the devil's face as he says I got him I'll forever hold them but God calling you God wooing you God send in the gospel to preach to you and then you make that choice to him the devil realizes right then that he's lost his hold that God already foreknew it your choices don't surprise God already knew it can you see man do we fall and make mistakes yep but we don't mean to do we make bad choices yeah but we don't mean to and the prophet says you will do wrong but you don't do it willfully you're trapped in anything you're trapped into or do something that you don't mean to do it's not sin yet because you'll repent the minute you see that you're wrong you'll quickly turn say I didn't mean see that and you'll say that all through life a man don't want to be and that's the reason we're so stupid and so in dark down here on Earth but as there's a blood atonement for us to keep us covered all the time can you say man you love him oh the Lord is wonderful [Music] and Jesus was his name born in a man Danger two years old a strange a man of sorrow can we go up a key [Music] oh my love him how I adore you my breasts my son shine Shines My All In All the great create ER became my savior and all God's fullness dwellers [Music] in here oh what condensation energy bringing us reading that in the dead of night not one faint hope in sight God gracious tears he laid aside all is splendored stooping to woo to win to save my soul he done it for you and oh how I long what a response our love to him we are not one that treats his blood lightly we are not one that just turns and walks away he had an influence on her life [Music] these are all in all bless the name of the Lord the great Creator he became my savior and all all God's fullness [Music] without realized flesh and blood your substance he took the form of man revealed oh glorious [Music] sacrifice of God and now I know Thou Art the Great great um can you sing it now [Music] in my breasts My Sunshine He's My All In All the great creator [Music]
