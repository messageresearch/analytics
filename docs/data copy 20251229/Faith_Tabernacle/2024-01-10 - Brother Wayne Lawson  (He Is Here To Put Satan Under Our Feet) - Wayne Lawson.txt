the platform Lord take your word and speak to the heart of your children we commit this service into thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen and amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'd like to go into the book of Ephesians one more time amen and uh uh I'm sure uh uh maybe you'll get something different than the book of Ephesians tomorrow night amen but I just want to uh continue here Ephesians chapter 1 I want to read the 19th to the 23rd verse um you know what let's just back up to the 17th verse here that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him it's a very a tremendous thing there Paul was saying give the spirit of wisdom revelation of course you know brother BR said pray for Revelation more than anything else so he wasn't unscriptural and he knew that wisdom and Revelation was needed in the knowledge of God because that's the only way you can know him is through Revelation but watch the next verse but the eyes of your understanding being enlightened in one one of the translations it says let your heart be flooded with understanding that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the the glory of his inheritance and the Saints so he's asking for revelation of God and then he's asking Lord to Open the Eyes of the people so they can see their part in it and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above now somebody say far above far above far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and he hath put all things somebody say all things all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all all in all amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you can be seated tonight amen and I I want to just use this for a title if I can he is here to put Satan under your feet to put Satan under your feet now we're here tonight realizing that this book of Ephesians of course is a parallel to the Old Testament Joshua so brother Bram uh brother Bram is is very clear in talking about that his ministry is a comparison to the ministry of Joshua and that the ministry would be bringing us into an Ephesians into the New Testament promises that was given to the church now brother BR said but we have come to another Paradox of an Ephesians in the last days and so we recognize that the leadership of God would lead the church into its position in the word of God and this is exactly what Paul is doing is he is positionally placing the church in God so that they can see the author Authority which he has invested into them and that of course gives us the right kind of faith when you can see and watch what Paul is saying when you can see what he is then you can see what you are when you can see what he has done then you can see what you can do because it's what has been done in him is what's been done for you now according to Ephesians here amen the Bible says that he has rought in Christ and raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places so to be able to understand uh what God has done for the church you have to exceed the great power which he exhibited in Christ when he raised a dead body from a tomb and placed him at the right hand of God that's the kind of power we're talking about the kind of power that can take a man that's dead cold dead in a grave and take him from that place of death all the way to immortality sitting on the throne of God that's the kind of power that's working in your life tonight that's the kind of power that's working upon the church tonight and you'll never understand that until you see that in Christ and then recognize that's the power that is working in you now he set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places amen now this of course when Paul was saying this you got to sometimes you got to stop and think about Paul and he's talking to these uh Ephesians and these Hebrews and he's trying to tell these people things but the but the the the we're we're reading the book of Ephesians which been written 2,000 years but Paul was reading from the Old Testament which had been written before his time and he was bringing the revelation of Jesus Christ currently from the Old Testament and he didn't have the book of Ephesians to read he was writing the book of Ephesians and it was given to the church so what he would be referencing would be Old Testament scripture so when he would say he was sitting at the right hand now y'all know what he's talking about from Psalms 110 it was David that wrote for the Lord said unto my Lord set thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol and the Lord shall send thy rod of thy strength of Zion and rule in the midst of thine enemies and the people shall be willing in the day of thy power and the beauties of thine Holiness from the womb of the morning for thou Hast a do of thy youth now the Lord has sworn and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of mecdc now of course when David wrote this you know he's talking about amen this this great God that they're serving and that he was saying the Lord said unto my Lord now that confused a lot of of real educated and Theological people but we people who follow a prophet that's not confusing at all because brother Bram said it means the root and The Offspring of David he was both David's root and he was David's Offspring so that's just real simple to a Believer amen but what he was saying here was that that God would raise up Jesus Christ a man to sit at his right hand now here's the thing they all prophesied this and they believed that prophecy and of course they heard Abraham talk about MDC and what was written in Genesis concerning him and that the Messiah would be the son of David he would also be the son of Abraham and they and that was all good as long as there was no man involved in that but when Jesus Christ amen when his name started getting involved in them scripture it was different see see when you go to Psalms 100 psalm 16 you'll find here in the eth verse David said I have set the Lord all always before me because he is at my right hand and I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and Glory rejoices for my flesh shall also Rest In Hope and thou will not suffer leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption for thou will show me the path of life and then the presence of Joy at thy right hand is Pleasures forever more amen now what Paul is discussing is he's discussing that all of this Messianic Prophecy of the right hand of God Amen now he's saying that Jesus has been lifted up and is setting at the right hand of God this man whom they're not willing to receive as the Messiah at all Paul is now exalting him to the authority and the Throne of the Living God Paul is teaching them anything you're going to get from God is going to have to go through Jesus Christ you're going to have to get it in the name of Jesus or you're not going to get it at all because he sets at the right hand of God now it's according to the Book of Mark in the 16th chapter it said then after the Lord had spoken unto him he received him up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with a signs and following now according to the book of Acts when Peter was preaching on the day of Pentecost he brings Psalms 100 psalm 16 into into his thought I don't know if you've ever read it but Peter's sermon is quite powerful won't read it all to you but let me read you from the 29th verse down to the 36th men and Brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David for he is both dead and buried and his supplier is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet I like that David's a prophet wasn't he he said and knowing that God has sworn with an oath to him that the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to set on his throne he seen this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus hath God raised up wherewith we are all Witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost had shed forth this and you now see and hear for David is not ascended un the heavens but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord set thou at my my right hand now we're in Psalms amen 110 he says until I make thy fools foes thy foot stol therefore let all of the House of Israel know assuredly that God hath made this same Jesus whom you've crucified both the Lord and the Christ do you see see David right here Peter is tying together Psalms 11:0 and psalm 16 and he's saying it was fulfilled in Jesus Christ because David don't said it right hand of God he said but Jesus Christ has been raised up and sits at the right hand of God now you see what Paul is saying that Jesus has been raised and set in Heavenly places now in Hebrews 12 and verse 2 it's again that Paul would say he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God in Romans 8 and 34 again he'll say it's Christ that died they rather that is risen again who Seth at the right hand of God in Colossians 3 and verse 1 1 again he'll say Christ sth at the right hand of God Hebrews chapter 1 the third verse he himself purged our sins and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high in Hebrews 8 and verse one he is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty on high in Hebrews 10 amen this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God isin't that beautiful Hebrews chapter 10 the 12th verse but this man isn't it beautiful what Paul did right there this man amen is't that something amen God's Throne we know is for a spirit but now the Bible is telling us there is a man setting on the throne of God oh Church you don't know what that means amen it means that Adam's race fell and they lost Authority but our Lord Jesus Christ amen regained the throne for the human race and tonight there is a man there's one of us sitting on the throne of God and he'll hold the position until all of the ransom Church of God is saved to sin no more I'm talking about Jesus Christ the son of God sets tonight in supreme authority in Supreme control over death hell and the grave he rules over every principality he rules over Powers he is the king of kings he is the Lord of lords he is above all things and there is nothing above his name his name is Jesus and there is nothing above him every name that could be named there is no name above the name of Jesus Christ amen we have a man on the throne of God according to 1 Peter chapter 3 and: 20 to who has gone into the heavens and is on the right hand of God with Angel and authorities and Powers being made subject unto him oh I'll tell you tonight our Jesus sits in power amen I'll tell you he's our Lord isn't he amen do you know the prophet says here he says you know there's some of the verses of scriptures if you would isolate them you could make it sound like there was more than one God he said but see with a closer look at scripture it it would give you a better Prospect let's just look at the Scripture it said Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou H has created all things and for thy pleasure they were created now notice carefully in verse two it says one not two or three but one set on the throne in verse three he said not they but but but not not not they but he was to look upon as jasper stone in verse n it says the Beast gave honor to him not them in verse 10 it says that the the elders fell down before him not them in verse 11 it says the Lord cried Thou Art Worthy oh Lord not Lords in verse 11 it says that one Throne was the creator which is Jesus in John 1 and3 which is the Jehovah Spirit god of the Old Testament Genesis 1:1 now let us not stop there go on and read Revelations 3 and 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne amen so what you're looking at is he sat down at the right hand of God when John looked he only saw one upon the throne he say see it was not until Revelations 56 and8 that you see it which follows Revelation 4 2 and 3 in sequence now what's he saying that hym that set upon the throne what is it it's the mystery of one God Jesus came from God became manifested In the Flesh died and rose again and returned unto the bosom of the Father the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father have declared him John chap 1 and verse 8 what does the Bible tells us it tells us that Jesus overcame and sat down with the father in his throne he said I come from God and I've returned to God he is in the bosom of God tonight amen do you see there is a Corporal body in heaven tonight our Lord Jesus Christ A Nails scard Memorial amen our man is still in the heavens tonight sitting upon the throne of almighty God do you know the Bible teaches us that that same one that sits on the throne will have a day of power amen according to Psalms chap 10 110:3 that the people shall be willing in the day of his power now I don't know about y'all but I'm not looking for them people I believe I'm looking after people I believe the people that is prophesied to be willing in the day is setting k here tonight I believe there is a people on the face of the Earth that which God has pre-prepared you Amen to be vessels of the glory and honor and the power of the ministry of the son of man what good would it do for God to bring resurrection power in the church if there was no vessels to hold that power but I believe there are people tonight who are willing to receive whatever God is wanting to send we did not come here tonight just to be our own people with our own Ministries but we have come to surrender to the will of him that has sent his Mercy in this hour it is a day of power it is a season of power but there is a people who are willing to exhibit that power in its day in the day of his power oh my goodness I believe it don't you Jesus said in Matthew 28 that Jesus came and spoke and said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me and what did he do with that power he sent forth his church with that power all power and authority was given unto this church amen what was it brother bham you remember what he told us brother brandham was standing there on the river he said see it was not me I didn't do these things he said it was what I surrendered myself to do you see it's what he surrendered to he said I was only there when he did it remember that amen it wasn't me that spoke the squirrels it was he it wasn't me amen that healed Georgie it was he it wasn't me that gave Hade her children it was he who is he come on church he said I must decrease and he must increase when he the spirit of truth shall come who is that he it's he the Lord Jesus Christ in the person of the token spirit that was prophesied to fall in the age we're living in what good would it do for God to send power if there was no vessel to exhibit power I I often maybe I could just say it to you like this what good would it do for the television station to send a signal tonight if there was no s television to receive the signal right but no television ever put forth a program that didn't come from somewhere so when somebody said well the game's playing at 9:00 tonight if there's no television on you would never know the game played and if God said I'm going to send power in a certain age if there was no Prophet on the scene to exhibit that power the power would have never been known to the church come on now the god that always was is the god that is he's always been the same God but he just shows his power in a certain season to bring you into the revelation of the age that you're living in it's what I surrendered myself to huj you remember it's not it's remember is it post pulsating to you deep call the deep is it pulsating to you this is not William brandom he's loaned his voice to me it's I the Lord remember it's a pulsation of faith that you are receiving amen that God brings it into the church now amen according according to the scriptures amen that Jesus has an Earthly body Jesus said I come from God I go to God is that right after his death his burial his resurrection Ascension that body was to set at the right hand of God now I don't mean God's got a right hand God's a spirit but the right hand means power and authority of God that is the name everything in heaven is named now you see that logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons of God to be Anointed with that same logos to that same logos Jesus Christ the same 1961 he has to be the same in the attitude the same in power the same in everything except for the physical body it that sits at the right hand of God his spirit is here in us to manifest himself and to make our lives make it exactly what it was see that's what he promised the Holy Ghost when it is to come he will testify and show you things that are to come we know that is true yes sir he is the same in every principle tonight except for the Corporal body that body is setting in heaven that body is in the Throne of God Amen that body is there now brother bam will explain it to us and he'll tell it like this he said now listen things of this world predestinated but God called of God elected chosen of God saved by God baptized into the body of the Holy Spirit made members of the body we are alive we are ready and we are willing my shadow will move every time anything of my body moves and the Holy Spirit Body of Christ will move just as Christ moves and if Christ is in heaven and can if he could his physical body or spiritual body on the Earth moving he wants it to move watch for things to happen see it's beginning to come to life they paralyzed it long enough but the holy spirit is bringing life in into it now what's he saying he said see if I'm standing here he said and I'm moving he said my shadow on the earth is moving so you wouldn't if if I was here and you were seeing my shadow on the ground every time that I moved my shadow moved that down there is my movement that the people see on the earth brother man said you are his body that the people are seeing the shadow of a movement in the heavens he said if you paralyze the Shadow you have paralyzed Jesus Christ but listen I don't believe he's paralyzed tonight I believe he a living God with many members I believe he's got legs that still move I believe he got hands that still move he's got lips that still speak he's got eyes and still see I believe he's got young people I believe he's got preachers he's got Elders he's got sisters he's got people all kinds of people because our God is alive not just in heaven he's alive in the soul of the Church of the Living God listen your faith is going to paralyze the world or the world's going to paralyze your faith well let me tell you tonight I believe it's time to paralyze the devil it's time to paralyze unbelief it's time to paralyze doubt and let the power of the Holy Spirit move like it's never moved before in your life shake off amen shake off all the bands and chains of unbelief and let the Holy Spirit move in your life Hallelujah you're his shadow can you imagine amen a shadow telling a person they couldn't move that's the way it is in the church when we tell God he can't move I say there ought to be a people who are willing to move in the day of his power this is his day of power there's got to be a people who are under that power [Applause] operating now the life of Christ returns in the form of the Holy Ghost not a nail scar isn't that powerful the Corporal body sits at the right hand of God to make intercession but the Holy Ghost has come to carry out his works now how can people say that the apostolic age has ceased where do you get that at how can a Vine come out and bear today and go out and bear an orange tomorrow this Bear Day bear a pumpkin it would have to change his life and Malachi 3 said he did not change at all do you see brother man said how is it then could we teach the end of an Apostolic age amen when this is the can I say this would be the cendo of the apostolic age this would be the climax of the apostolic age if there has ever been a day of the apostolic age this would be the day the Bible said amen that I am the vine and you are the branch brother man said if this church ever puts forth another Branch he said it'll be an original Branch it'll be an Act Two church it'll be an original church with original work with an original vine with an original life I'm talking about a church that's ready to give way to the power of God Amen forget the Creeds forget the domination forget the ideas of man what about God working through the church Apostolic power people talk about Apostolic power brother bam said it like this he said if a body was growing from the feet coming up he said more important bodies from the feet into the lungs into the heart into the head who is the head Christ the intelligence now the body the government I'm in Isaiah 9:6 now the government shall be upon his what that's exactly what happened in the quote brother B said the government is going to be upon the shoulder and the people H shoulders he said what is the shoulders his body now watch that's where the real true church speaks in power the apostolic power returns to the church when the government is upon his shoulders now you to preacher what are you talking about do youall know the headship of this church was the opening of that word it was the opening of The Seven Seals that brought headship back to the church we left the headship of the Baptist we left the headship of the Pentecostals we left the headship of the lutherans amen it was the end of the ages as far as inspiration was concerned and we moved to the prophetic of the word when the scriptures are being fulfilled and it brought Jesus back to the head of the church again can I just say it Willam brandom repositioned Christ as the head of the church amen he repositioned Christ as the head of the church and he said Christ is his word come on church and when the word is restored you now have original headship hallelujah it's back to the original headship of a word over a church hey that's where the real Church begins to speak in his power when the government is upon his shoulders amen now I go in the church book brother Ram said this we already see the visible manifestations of what I've been telling you you and you are seeing around us The ecumenical move and terrs is factual but also it is a fact that the prophet of the last age must be bringing forth a message of God that will forerun the second coming of the Lord and for by his message with a heart of the children be turned back to Pentecostal fathers with the restoration of word will be the restoration of power government on shoulders equals Apostolic power amen what is Apostolic power the faith of the Apostles has been restored to the church again amen what was it will I find faith when I return what kind of Faith Apostolic Faith the Faith of Our Fathers the book of Acts has got to live again church amen and God has said there would come forth in the last day a bride of that original Branch amen I believe it I believe that this Holy Ghost came I I I I hope you see what I'm saying the Holy Ghost come 2,000 years ago now come on the Holy Ghost fell 2,000 years ago but watch what the prophet said he said but down through this 2,000 years he said it's been bound up it's been bound for 2,000 years at the church has been bound the Holy Ghost for 2,000 years under modern under the church ages it's been bound not at the river Euphrates but the doors of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of man M systems but she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the Bible said do you see there'll be a people willing in the day of his power now you see that God could fill this room with the Holy Ghost amen but until somebody surrenders to that Spirit it will be powerless in this building brother bam said it over and over about Devils he said Devils don't have any power till they can get in a body until they can get into somebody so you can bind the devil tonight by that's by refusing him a vessel amen and God can come into this building tonight and if we refuse him a away amen he'll have to turn and leave the building amen but if we open up our hearts and we say God we're going to throw down every Creed we're going to throw down every feeling we're going to throw down every Dogma we're going to open up the doors and let God come in there's a power that will come in this church tonight and'll pardon every sinner it'll save every lost it'll change our children it'll change our liveses because there's a liberation of the word hallelujah this Holy Spirit has been bound by denominations for 2,000 years but we have found out the scripture says there will be a day that was neither night or day now you know he's in Zechariah 14 simple let's bring it down to a local church I know there's a couple different local churches gathered so you can take this home with you it'll be good for you wherever you go to church but have you ever seen a service that just gets locked up a little bit and and the preacher's preaching but it looked like the spirit don't get no further in the pull pit y'all been they ain't that way tonight and thank you thank you hallelujah thank you I just want to hug somebody reach over and Pat somebody say thank you cuz whatever is wrong you didn't bring it to church with you thank you thank you amen but what can happen is is is uh is somebody gets upset at somebody you know I know some of y'all never know nothing about these kind of things but you let somebody get the bickering a little bit and this person bickering with that person that person bicker and it wouldn't matter if you had if you had a it wouldn't matter if you had Ron Spencer preaching it wouldn't matter if you had brother W Martin preaching or brother Tim or Brother Don it wouldn't matter who was preaching the Holy Spirit could be right in the middle of it amen but it'll just get tight and you'll preach and you all you preachers now you'll preach and man you get to preaching so hard and it'll come up come up come up come up and you run out you just run out of strength cuz like you're lifting it yourself and all of a sudden you just let off for a second it's right back on the ground it's because that the anointing from the word is pushing it back but there's no Liberation for the spirit among the people so it's binding the Holy Spirit now you know he's here a prophet said he was the word said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them so something is abinding that Spirit look and it could be somebody's ill feelings it could be unworked out problems it could be disagreements in the body it could just little things working among people will bind that Spirit up well they done that not in the local church they' done it throughout the church ages and they made doctrines and they made Creeds and organizations and they barred the holy ghost from coming in the church so that man could lead and man could dictate oh but there was coming a day that will not be like that day but in the evening time there going to come light and there'll be a people on the Earth at the time of the coming of the power of God that they will say Lord let me Liberate the spirit of God I'll drop every Dogma I'll drop every Creed I'll drop every affiliation let the spirit of God move Among Us Lord [Applause] oh it's to be loosed in the evening time by the evening messenger woo hallelujah it's been bound by denominations for 2,000 years but the Holy Ghost is going to get loosed by the evening message in an evening time well let me tell you William Brandon was that evening messenger and this is the evening time and we are the evening time people and we have received of the Lord the loosening of the Holy Ghost and now the church has received a loosening we've had enough power to join Church put our name on the book but in the evening time that same great power of Christ would come upon his church like it did in the Eastern the Western would be the same May isn't it powerful things brother Braham has to say the holy ghost that come with power and manifestation and demonstration of his presence he says see there would not be one cruel word spoken against any move of God we'd all be one and one great big bundle of Godly love that's what it's going to take for the church to go in the Rapture I don't know about y'all I don't want to put my mouth against any of the move of God I don't want to hurt the oil I I don't want to hurt the wine I don't want to quench the spirit of God I want to get out of the way of God somebody said well I think that guy's this and I think that guy's this I tell you can learn something from the scripture remember remember when the scripture said it I think it what was the guy's name Nicodemus wasn't it amen when they said to him amen this is happening this is KF this is happen this is happening amen this is he said listen if it's of the Lord he said you're fighting God He said if it ain't of the Lord it'll come to nothing he said just let it go brother bam said it Let It Grow until it comes to the Harvest come on Church Let It Grow till it comes to the Harvest if it ain't of the Lord God in a harvest time will separate the two together but until that time leave it alone and let it grow let God work it out who's where and how's what's going to be but I'll tell you this Amen in this age that we're living in amen it's an evening light it's an evening time and it's now time that we have crossed over the human the ologies we have went beyond denominational now what's happening now brother B said all these things have darkened the eyes of the people theyve darkened these things from the Christian's eyes they darkened Divine Healing it darkened the power of God it darkened all the gifts of God and they applied it back there to when the Sun was shining and what brother Bram saying he said they said it was all back there in the days of the Apostles you remember brother Bram going to a Mee and sitting down he sat down to next he said it was some fell I forget what denomination it was he said but we were watching a Divine healer preach and brother B said he said the guy set mide him said you know he goes change clothes every time he gets to sweat and he got somebody come out and wipe his brow brother bam said oh really well that's good he said something B said well I think he gets a new car every year brother br said he just kept picking he said he said now see what it was was really what it was he's against that Divine Healing he said and he wanted me to get on him get in with him on picking on that preacher cuz he was standing for Divine Healing he said I seen what was behind it and you see sometime people and they pick here and pick here and pick there but you got to be smarter than that you got to look behind what's behind the thing amen sometimes just use your discernment and look a little bit deeper and see that it's the devil trying to destroy the works of God Amen because there's men of God in this age that are standing for the power of God sure you can pick on me amen but what are you picking on Amen I'm a voice for the message of the Hour come on church I'm a voice that stands in pulpits across the country and screams for the power of God for the liberty of God for the prayer lines for the baptism of the spirit for the moving of the Holy Ghost sure shoot me down amen but what do you shooting down when you do I tell you what we got men of God in this age I think we ought to Rally around the spirit of God I think we ought to leave the cruel words for the devil somewhere and get behind the moving of the Holy Ghost come sure brother Wayne's this and brother Andrew's out or brother Sean's this or brother hey some this guy's this and this and get to see what's behind it though they got a different opinion come on running their own show come on darkening the eye darkening the eye of the people from Divine Healing and Supernatural works of God now watch this but brother BR said there's coming light in the evening time these clouds are going to be broke amen oh I love it don't you sure there's been clouds of Doubt been a lot of clouds of doubt that have blown in through the through the can I say it the poisonous breasts of Satan now be careful I ain't after nothing but the devil now ain't your enemy now I ain't after nothing but the devil but if the devil's in this building tonight he's in real trouble so what you want to do is separate from him right now and the way you do that holler Amen to the word let the devil know what side of this you're WR I tell you the side I'm on I'm on the word side I've took sides with Jesus somebody's fighting I tell you where I'm at I'm on the side of the Lord amen I'm not on any man's side come on Church God's got a side in this we're on the Lord's Side Hallelujah that's right shout that devil out of here let him know we are one body We Are One People We Are One People Under the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are a many member body come on friends we might go to different buildings but one of these mornings our atoms are going to change these buildings are going to lose their power and we're going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye you talk about a holy ghost meeting up there on [Applause] Jesus brother Unity of The [Applause] Spirit Well we won't be out of order shouting there will we hey shouting on the hills of glory amen I'll have a brand new body hallelujah how you going to shut a man up when he knows his old body has gave way to a new body the very thing that denomination is fighting is the power of God and it's the very thing that will change your body clouds of Doubt Clouds Of Darkness nervousness and de depression settle on the people look at it look at it in the end time look what's happened amen but do you not know there's prophecy in this Bible that in the evening time there should be light look at this then Mark the 16th chapter say it and Jesus said I am and you shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power coming in the Clouds Of Heaven oh there's been clouds of Doubt but there's another kind of CL coming it'll be a Cloud of Glory and a cloud of power and anointing that comes on the church look at Luke 22 and 69 Hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God now if you're reading Luke 21:25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth and distress of Nations and perplexity and the Sea of waves roaring men's hearts are failing for fear look looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then look at this and then shall you see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and of great glory and when you these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your heads your Redemption draweth nigh now we'll reread that 27th verse and then shall we see the son of man coming in the cloud with power and great Glory there's a lot in that scripture now because if you're just reading the scripture in itself now you could say well brother Wayne that's that cloud that come in Arizona or you could go over here in Revelations 1 and you can see he's coming with clouds of power and great glory and every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess brother said which is not the Rapture it's just coming to the Jews right amen but look at the beauty of that both of those events are in Luke 21:27 you want me prove it to you turn to Matthew 24 what's the 49th verse immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light the Stars shall fall from Heaven the powers of Heaven shall be shaken now let's set you in the order of what brother Braham said in the Sixth Seal he said that's after the tribulation of those days that's not tribulation he said that's the pre-tribulation of ikan and Hitler he said on the Jews it's he said it in The Sixth Seal after that ikan affair it's immediately after the ikan affair the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light now do y'all really think that's all natural the Sun dark the moon not give us light what we're talking about is solar eclipse and and and and uh a moon eclipse two different eclipses there's a solar eclipse and also a moon eclipse now what what you're a lunar eclipse what you're dealing with and I'll just real quickly that's been happening for years but let's just say let's just say this is the Earth and let's say this is the Sun so what happens in a solar eclipse is the moon gets in between the Sun and the Earth the moon's the church right so the moon gets in between the two and the moon amen is there so the sun is darkened by the church Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people yeah but what's amazing is if you study this Eclipse you'll find that this type of eclipse that the sun itself doesn't give light to the Earth but there is a reflection coming through the Moon it makes the Moon look absolutely red so you can read it the Bible said it should be they call it Blood Moons right amen the the moon should be bloody what's it talking about when the church gets between the Sun and the Earth there's been solar eclipses for 2,000 years but there's never been a time that the Roman Church put itself between God and the people 1933 watch brother B begin them eclipes and remember what he said there in 63 he said Pope John just went to Jerusalem he said Jerusalem types the natural church he put the lights out then the other eclipse is the is the church and the reason they can't get of light is because they have put the Earth between them and the Sun so the church itself has been darkened by it can't receive the sunlight it cut itself off from the Sun so the church is darkened and the darkened church now darkens the Earth so the people are left without a hope the sun won't give its light the moon has come to Darkness the stars have fell from the heavens prise the Lord amen now you y'all ain't they all been seeing fallen stars for years what does brother Bram teach that is if you go to Christ the mystery of God revealed brother B said that Fallen star was watch Luther a messenger an angel of God a star and they fell in denomination and John Wesley fell in denomination and stars begin to fall The Sun Won't Give it light the moon will not be able to BR bring reflection what's going going on it is a spiritual happening amen even the powers of Heaven had become shaken but the Bible said then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven now watch semicolon and then shall the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in powers of heaven with power and great Glory two different events in the same scripture the sign of the son of man in heaven giving us a Cloud of Glory and power but there shall also be something appearing to Israel of glory and power and honor but the Church of the Living God will be gone in the sign of the son of man if you got that picture of the cloud you can pull it up right now amen what is it amen It's The Sign of the son of man in heaven now now now look when you look at this I want you to realize something amen that what is happening here is something that's being shown in the heavens before it happens on the earth we see the sign of the son of man in heaven but now we'll see the sign of the son of man on the earth what is it it's the sign of of the resurrection power of Jesus Christ sir now I'll tell you what's powerful if you if you like to read your Bible now brother B said you see see the son of man coming in cloud with power and great Glory when these things begin to come to pass look up you see your Redemption draweth nigh and over here in Zechariah the 14th chapter it says it shall be one day shall be known to the Lord not day or night but it shall come to pass in that time shall be light now he ties together the Book of Luke and the book of Zechariah watch in trying to do God a service he said there shall be signs in the heavens above when this begins to take place earthqu in di places and there appear a sign in heaven of the son of man then that day Luke the son of man will reveal himself again and be revealed himself so he's placing that Luke 17:30 with Luke chapter 21 and verse 27 and he's tying the two events together to let you know something is going to happen on Earth but it's been declared in the heavens at the same time that denomination is bringing a cloud of Doubt to Brock the sunlight out God has brought the sign of the son of man to bring the resurrection power back upon the church there shall be a day of power like no other age has ever seen there will be an exhibition of the baptism of the the holy ghost in the power of the token it will take a restoration of the word of God to bring the church back to this kind of power we shall know who we are we shall know what we are about we shall know what we are to do amen Apostolic power returns not a gloomy day not a gloomy day when that white wigged one come on when that white wigged one shows up now look at the beauty of this folks folks now we we ain't left our subject watch this white wig one show up how many knows this is Daniel the 7th chapter Bible readers now if you're reading Daniel 2 do you remember Nebuchadnezzar's dream and he had a statue do you remember what destroyed that statue a stone out of the mountain those same Kingdoms in Daniel 7 are represented as creatures right and what is it that destroys those creatures the Ancient of Days the Ancient of Days of Revelations 10 is also Daniel 2 the stone hewed out of the mountain amen it is the thing that destroys the work of the devil Satan for 2,000 years has worked to take the church out of the power of God but here in the last days God would bring a sign that would destroy everything things Satan has done in 2,000 years come on now come on we got to get we got to get to the scriptures let's look and see as look back in the Garden of Eden and look what Satan done here Eve stood in power but Satan come in and took the word away from her and the minute the word left her she was thrown down into death but as she was thrown into death there was prophecy that come on her and it said thy woman's seed shall bruise the head of the serpent oh that laid there in the scripture a woman's seed shall bruise the head of the serpent but we don't see that manifestation for 4,000 years and for 4,000 years Satan is working and he's working and he's working and he's working and 4,000 years of work oh but when Jesus Christ the son of God was born into the Earth they took him up to Cal's cross and there in one moment he destroyed the world of Satan from the Garden of Eden all the way back to the Garden of Eden again can you ever see that Jesus was the promise that the works of the devil would be destroyed that through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ that there would be a destruction of everything that holds a Believer out of the presence of God that's when mortality would be crushed under the foot of Jesus Christ that's when Human Nature would be crushed under the feet of Jesus Christ and he would be called The Mighty conqueror I want you to think about this now because the prophecy of Genesis 3 was fulfilled in the cross in Matthew 27 and when Jesus fulfilled the scriptures brother Amos he cried that great and wonderful prayer and he said it is finished can you imagine amen he said it is finished now what is finished Satan is finished his power is finished his a program is finished because Jesus Christ has destroyed the works of the devil that day at Calvary I'll say tonight that God broke the backbone of Satan that day at Calvary can I say that every sin that you would ever commit was destroyed that day at Calvary Jesus Christ is the mighty conqueror and he conquered grave and he conquered hell and he conquered death and he conquered sicknesses he conquered the grave he conquered nature itself come on from the cross it is finished now the Bible tells us that he would Ascend to the right hand of the father but brother Mark Paul lets us in on a revelation in the book of Ephesians and he said before he ascended before he ascended we've talked about him sitting at the right hand of God but before he got there before Jesus ever got to the right hand of God he went to hell as a sinner brother John he went there in the death of a sinner at the death of the Cross and brother bandam said he went there by taking the bee of death into his own bosom oh I I tell you y'all got to forgive me but when I get to thinking about it I get to to thinking about Satan blowing his blowing his ego up for 4,000 years thinking he really had done something thinking he had took that woman seed out with Jacob he took him out with Moses he took him out with Isaac he took him out with Malachi he thought oh I I've already rid the Earth of that seed and it wasn't very powerful amen but that morning brother B said there was a knock come on his door he said he come to the door to find out who it was and he said when he looked at him he said I am the right say son of God I am the seed of the woman and he said I thought I had you when I got Jacob I thought I had you when I got Moses but now I got you I tell you what he didn't know what he had a hold of did he he he didn't know what he got a hold of he got a hold of the word without reluctance the word and his Purity and the prophet of God told us a beautiful story he said that Jesus reached out and got that Devil by the neck can you imagine Jesus getting that Devil by the neck you know what that tells me he took a hold of your depression on he took a hold of your nervousness he took a hold of that Spirit of lust he took a hold of that thing that would destroy your life he took a hold of it and brother B said he slapped him upside the face and kicked him back into hell and took the keys of death hailing the grave off of his side you know what the devil don't even have the keys to his own house tonight because before Jesus ascended he descended into the pit and he destroyed your enemy and put him under his foot well the Bible tells us that when God raised up Jesus he raised him up to set far above every principality every Power every name that can be named I don't care what name it's above Moses it's above Paul it's above James John Peter it's above Luther it's above Wesley it's above brother Ram it's above every name of God and it's also above every demon a disease and depression and cancer I'm talking about the name of Jesus Christ it is above all [Applause] names it's a name that's above all names a name that you can speak and every demon has to Bow a name that you can speak and everything is UN H [Applause] Hallelujah before he ascended he descended and took the keys from the devil of his own house can you imagine the devil ain't got keys to his own house brother said he conquered death hell and the grave isn't it beautiful he left Satan powerless the Bible tells us that as he began his Ascension that he first stop he made was over there in paradise and took the keys and turned loose the children of God Amen it it's a powerful thing folks because the last one in was in by total Grace and he come in at the last hour hanging on the cross next to the crucified word which was a type that there would be a bride who would be the last ones in that would come in by absolute Grace amen at the time of a crucified Christ well they can crucify Christ but they will never crucify the effect of the word that the bride has got on her tonight she went in by that [Applause] word that's how he went in that's how he come out come on he come out under the leadership of Jesus brother bam tells us he went up by the he went up by that and gave them keys to Apostle Peter and said whatever you buy on Earth that unlearned fisherman hallu was given authority of the key to the kingdom of heaven he now possessed the power to bind and to loose the power of Jesus Christ all power in Heaven and Earth was given unto him let me say what brother Ram said all that was in God was poured into Christ and all that was in Christ was poured into the church so sitting here tonight all the power of the godhead is down in the bride's body tonight and it's here to manifest the authority and power now that Devil's going to try to make you fearful that Devil's going to try to build up complexes and ideas and unbelief to make you unwilling to use that power in this age Hall come now if you're under the wrong head they'll tell you look look I'll tell you this you're never going to get there you're never going to make it it's never going to happen but there's another headship Hallelujah come on and he cometh with a sign now look what that devil did he spent 2,000 years trying to eradicate what it was that done but the Bible says there will come a day of power when the sign of the son of man shall appear again in heaven he will show he is still Supreme deity he is still supreme power he is still supreme authority brother said the white of his wig were Angels signifying his authority then who has the right to interpret the seals it was him amen now some of y'all been around the message a long time and you know this very clearly but Brother Sam that's a picture of his head come on and there is nothing but the picture of the head in this picture way up in the sky you can see miles beneath it 26 miles beneath it and it was no body it's just this head now let me ask you this why is it only a picture of the head because he already has body so who does this body belong [Applause] to who do we belong to we're not under any Bishops we're not under any Apostles we're not under any denominations we don't belong to any fellowships or circles amen what we belong to is the presence of Jesus Christ in the last days that has come to put every Spirit under the feet of the children of the Living God in this [Applause] age can I take a few minutes now this picture is actually in scripture let me read it to you and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was about his head and his face were as it was the Sun and his feet as of pillars of fire how many knows where I'm going with that oh yeah prise God I many knows where I'm going with that and his feet as at Pillar of Fire so so I want to know do I need to tell you his feet is as the pillars of fire can can I ask you what part of a man is his feet it's a part of his body now let me ask you again where's his body come on come on yes see when you're identified in the scripture you're identified as his feet the pillars of fire amen now according to scriptures now amen now let me just let me just say this very clearly this is the age of the return of the pillar of fire let's see that picture right quick this is an age of the return of the pillar of fire if you've never seen it if you're on video tonight I'm going to take an extra minute to tell you what what we're looking at here is everybody the first thing they'll say is that's brother brandham but it's not brother brandham we're focusing on here just take your thought a little higher it's what's over brother brandom's head there is what the focus is that is none other than the Covenant Angel of the Bible our Lord Jesus Christ in a spirit body that Pillar of Fire is hiding the invisible God but it is a visible presence of the invisible God so that you can see him now I tell you what amen the thing about this picture is it was taken in front of about 30,000 people in the Sam Houston Coliseum and y'all know the story so I won't tell you the whole story but I want to tell you this part I didn't take the picture okay come on on do you know what your dad didn't take it my dad didn't take it my grandma my wife's grandma was in brother Bam's meetings in Jonesboro but she didn't take that picture can I go on and say this it wasn't one follower of William brandham that took that picture on the contrary it was one of the critics that was trying to throw him out of Houston hired somebody to make fun of brother brandham and brother Bosworth and all of their pictures went bad except that one picture and when they developed that picture the FBI proved it was the only Supernatural photograph ever it's in Washington DC and the critics can laugh and they can scoff amen but while we're where they at when brother Brandon was here and he was saying it's the only Supernatural photograph but let me give you more than that it's not the only time the picture was taken it was taken another time on brother ROM's shoulder it was taken another time in Germany and it was seen coming into the room and leaving the room amen because this is the age we said there will be a day of his power when the same Pillar of Fire I was in the first church has returned in the last days to leave this bride into the the rapturing faith of Jesus Christ I tell you what tonight I salute the return of our Lord Jesus Christ in the form of a pillar of fire I am not ashamed of that picture I am not backwards of that picture brother brandom they asked brother brandom they said brother brandom do you want to copyright this he said no sir I don't want to make nothing off of this picture he said if he thought enough of me to come down and have his picture taken with me come on folks I know a lot of good preachers but none of them have their picture taken with the angel of the Lord as their [Applause] headship now you say brother bra brother Wayne you've lost your mind now let me just take a moment here brother bam says listen he said now he said listen it was in the pillar of fire breaking itself up Acts chapter 2 and it come upon each one of them Fort licks blazes now what your looking at broke itself up and come into the People clothing tongues of fire set upon them Forks of fire clothing tongues like fire set on each one of them and they were filled with that now watch in the absolute brother B said do you see we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of God yeah we come together then the pillar of fire is manifested in its wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sets together in Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church each one US holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings the pillar of fire back again amen Be not Afraid 1961 he separated himself in the pillar of fire divided himself amongst His People clothing tongues of fire set upon each of them God separating himself to his church no under he said where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them each one of us holding a part Hallelujah then you can't go without me and I can't go without you we're each one holding a part of that Pillar of Fire Hallelujah brother Ram says it the pillar of fire again he said God in Christ was the same person and here he is back as the holy spirit amen what what is it the anointing is here with me now the angel of the Lord the pillar of fire amen what is it he says now you said brother Wayne that's just for the prophet when Jesus died the temple veil was rent not only a high priest but who soever will can have that same anointing of the shakana glory now this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through sanctifying Grace of the blood brought many sons which is the anointed with that same logos amen and the pillar fire is not he he said it's his Spirit form which is upon the son of man has now come to anoint sons of men to bring back the ministry Abraham 1960 just like it did when it was on the earth in the flesh of the Son of God now it's on the earth in the flesh of adopted sons of God hallelujah how you going to put that adoption out in the future the prophet is saying that the pillar of fires here now in adopted Sons come on church I know people's talked about that manifestation of sons like it's going have to be an angel before you get there is it something you're going to have to be an angel before you ever a manifested son that's not what the scriptures saying at all it said God had something in his mind before the world began and at some point what he had in his mind about a son would be manifested on the Earth Earth and this day this scripture is fulfilled when God sent this message he sent the pillar of fire I don't know how else to say it the word had to be quickened by the anointing that spoke it and if you have a different anointing than the what spoke it you don't have the complete start yet but because God that Loos is what spoke your name in the beginning and it's now come to claim the body amen of the word that was spoken in the beginning well I know that's going to go real deep for you but let me just say it real clearly brother man said your name was written before the in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I wondered one time how what was is written how was it written brother brandom he said it was written by the spoken word hallelujah then that spoken word seed that lays in your heart has now met the same thing that spoke it into EX existence in the beginning has come to the Earth to claim it the word has come to the word the Gen SE has me the fire of God and it is ignited a life on the inside you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about God taking over the church it's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ now look what it is it's that Pillar of Fire somebody said well brother Wayne I'm looking for that Pillar of Fire I'm looking for that Pillar of Fire do you know Brother Sam here's the beauty of it I am looking at it oh yeah I'm not looking for it come on now s came I'm not looking for the pillar of Fire come on I know right where it is I am not looking for it I am looking at it you say brother Wayne you're looking at a bunch of people let me tell you those are not just people you're looking at that is the redeemed of God that has been Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and has come under the claim of the Lamb's Book of Life and has been named The Bride of Jesus Christ it's time for you to recognize who you are you are not just another church you the Queen of Heaven and all of Heaven has come down and the royalty of God to gather around this church to see them back in the [Applause] glory the pillar of fire is here the other day other day brother Ray come in the office he he come in three or four of us was in the office back at home and brother Ray hadn't made it in yet Nathan Ericson was sick and brother Steven was sick and they hadn't made it into the church yet brother Ronnie long looks over at me me and Isaac he says he says uh Brother Ray going to be here today and just as he asked the question Brother Ray walked in the room I said now there is a true answer amen but what if Brother Ray had been standing out in the hall what if he'd been standing out in the hall he's in that room and Ronnie just open the door and looks out and sees him and he says to me yeah he's here now I might not see him with my eye but I'm talking to the man that saw him and some of you might not have seen that light with your eye but we're talking to the man that saw it and he said it's in the adopted Sons and Daughters of God do you see this he's in every person that has a baptism of the Holy Ghost in This Age come on now Hallelujah and his feet are as pillars of fire hallah you're not just you're you're actually in scripture now what's he doing what's he doing his feet is pillars of fire he's coming down y'all know the scripture he's coming down and he's placing one foot upon land and one foot on sea now y'all know that's Revelations 13 remember Rome all them four beasts to Daniel 7 are put together and they're coming out of the water Revelation 13:1 they're coming out of the water as a Roman system and somebody puts their foot on itall pillars of fire put their foot on denominational systems that other foot is to land on land Revelation chap 13 it changes from Pagan to Pap Rome and when it becomes paple it moves and becomes a denominational system and moves into America and becomes the seed of Satan with the mark of the beast and the image will come forth at the last days but there's somebody going to put their foot on the head of that system in America so one foot on Hollywood and the other foot on Rome and there's a bride standing over the devil in the L St come on Church you know what I'm talking about and you said brother Wayne why in the world would God do something like this you know this is in the Bible the Book of Joshua Joshua parallels Ephesians now if you go back to the Book of Joshua Joshua the 10th chapter actually there is a battle of five Kings y'all know the battle and Joshua's in this great battle of five Kings he joins in the battle to help it but it turns into evening time now you see the type in the evening time A great battle being fought actually the greatest battle ever fought is fought in the evening time and what was Joshua needing to win the battle light but there's no light in the evening time so he spoke the word and the light that Joshua had was a spoken word light listen to me time shall be no more in the evening time there's no more time but a prophet puts light in the age and there's a bride in the greatest battle ever fought but look God begins to defeat our Devils he begins to defeat our enemies he actually already defeated them that day at Calvary you some Wayne then why would he need to defeat him again come on in Joshua the 10th chapter they fought through the night they destroyed their enemy the armies were conquered but in the middle of of this fight the five Kings had been gathered up and placed into a cave and [Music] bound were Bound in a cave where they couldn't do nothing until their power Was Defeated now Joshua was told by the Lord go back and open that cave now when those kings five of them step out they step out of that cave they're kings they're defeated Kings they're kings but they're conquered Kings and you remember remember the scripture it's a beautiful scripture and he took his captains of the host of the Lord and he laid down those five Kings and he told the captains of the army come here come here and put your neck on the head of this thing put your foot right here on the neck of this devil I want I want you to personally put it under your foot it's all already conquered it can't hurt you it can't touch you but so you know it's Defeated come here and the greatest Powers you've ever fought against come here and put your foot on this thing and the captains of that Army put their foot on their head have defeated enemies now your enemy Satan Was Defeated that day at Calvary but he raised up his ugly head in the last days have you ever wondered why brother Ram said all of Hell the lid's been taking off he said and all the hell has been poured out into this age I was looking that the other day and I thought L look at this God opened the cave up he opened up the cave and let that devil back out but he didn't let that devil out to defeat you he let that devil out because he's already defeated and he wants you to know he's already defeated so he told his bride come on out of here bride and let the pillars of fire stand on the head of the enemy in the last day and we'll put every denomination under our foot and we'll put every fashion of Hollywood under our feet because we are the Bride of Jesus Christ fighting a defeated enemy you don't have to conquer death it's already conquered you don't have to conquer sickness it's already conquered You Don't Have To Conquer Cancer it's already conquered you don't have to conquer disease you don't have to conquer depression you don't have to conquer nervousness it's already already conquered we are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus we are the pillars of fire Hallelujah you might see a man I see the pillar of fire you might see a kid I see the pillar of fire but the eyes of your understanding being Enlighten of the power that rest in this bride seated in Heavenly placesall he is here to put Satan under your feet [Applause] H you know brother Sean I got to wondering how God could turn loose the devil on his own bride I got to thinkk him one day I got to thinking about this real seriously and the lord gave me a little example it' be a little bit like maybe you and sister Heather yall head over to Rono in know big city life and you're walking down the street and it's late night you come out of a nice little place to eat and you start walking back to your car and you hear voice out of the darkness over stand in the shadows there's a large man and he says to you give me your money or I'm going to take your life well fear immediately your guns in the car you know you got your wife with you you don't he's a big man got a strong voice he's very scary but all of a sudden out of the parking lot comes a comes a car and the light shine over on that big man in that voice and when you look over there he's standing there and he's got cuffs on his feet he's got cuffs on his hands and he's bound up and he's tired and he's standing there and always he got a mouth but when the light hits him and you see it for what it is come here come here Heather slap him right the only reason that God would let a devil come at you because it's already defeated it's already bound it's already defeated it's already conquered he's just brought it here so that you can know the devil is conquered the devil is defeated but put your foot on it put your foot on it tonight and say Satan I will not back off of you the light has shined and I see your defeated I see you're a bluff I see you're a big mouth but we are pillars of fire and we're here to crush him stand to your feet with us tonight every enemy Hallelujah well somebody shout Glory pillars of fire pillars of fire how many pillars of fire I got in here tonight my soul's on fire brother Wayne God set me a fire he he didn't set you a fire just for you to go through this life I feel sorry for the devil tonight I always wondered why God opened that cave cuz there was five wise virgins let me tell you tonight there's some people in this building you need to remind yourself I'm here to put my foot on this [Music] thing so brother Wayne I feel like I've been under the Devil he's out of place he's not supposed to be on your head he's supposed to be under your foot and just remind him of the place that God gave him and all things have been put under your feet all things have been put under your feet you got a song brother Daniel oh Satan your Kingdom's coming down oh Satan your Kingdom's coming down well you've been building your kingdom all over this land but Satan your Kingdom's coming down well now Satan your

from my God say well Satan we're going to praise this Kingdom down you know I was studying the other day and come across the book of Chronicles that David picked out 28,000 men to serve in the Tabernacle 4,000 men were singled out and appointed to play instruments and sing can you imagine the kind of Praise services they had around there 4,000 people all their job was to do was to sing and play and the Bible said they sang scaly and Loud isn't that powerful somebody say well why in the world but he put one out of ever seven men to just singing and playing because David understood the power of praise David knew praise was a way out when there was no way out I tell you what you do when you see everything's against you and you got no no way out just start praising the Lord and if you start praising the Lord it'll make a way where there is no way that's how Jonah got out of the belly of the whale he begin to praise the Lord that's how the Hebrew children got God into the fiery furnace he begin to praise the Lord the Bible said the Lord inhabits the praise of his people y'all know what that inhabit that that word inhabit actually means Throne or setting place he inhabits he sits down he enthrones himself in the praise of his people so when you see when you're in a position where there's no way out and there's no hope and there's nothing amen pull up a cheer for Jesus if you start praising the Lord you brought Jesus into the problem I tell you tonight if you got something happen in your life just begin to praise the Lord put that devil under your foot and say Satan I'm going to praise your kingdom down where Satan I'm on to praise the kingdom down I heard voice from Heaven say San we're going to tell your kingdom down oh yes Satan we're going to preach your

Satan we're going to tear your kingdom down what weapon you going to use you I Heard a Voice from my God say you know praise is not just a way of Escape do you know praise is a weapon when jat had all the odds against him and he had no way out the Bible said go unpo yourself some singers and get the Levites that David chose and put them out in front of the children of Israel and he said the battle don't belong to you the battle is the Lords he said for God shall set an ambush upon your enemy and when they got there their enemy was dead praise was the weapon that destroyed their enemy and tonight praise is a weapon to destroy the depression in your life it's a weapon to destroy the nervousness put that thing under your foot just begin to praise the Lord and say Satan you ain't got no ride in this church you ain't got no ride in my home you ain't got a ride in my life break the powers of that devil tonight it's a weapon tonight [Applause] woo let me get out here where my critic can
