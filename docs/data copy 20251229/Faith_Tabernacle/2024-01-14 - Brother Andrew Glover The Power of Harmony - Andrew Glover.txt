and we appreciate you coming uh just each and every one of you uh for making the meeting possible and you've come with your licks of fire and uh come creating an atmosphere for the Lord to to work Among Us and I believe lives have been touched and um I I'm just looking forward to what God is going to do tonight and I just want to just say I I appreciate the men of God that have have labored here here uh brother Wayne brother Josh now brother Andrew and they mean very much to me and uh just they stand for the gospel and um you know Satan is attacking the ministry in this day and and I know they go through a lot of things in their own lives and just discouragements but they stay strong amen and they just stay faithful to the word of God and uh I have been blessed by their Ministry and I know you have too and um and but their Ministries would be in vain if there wasn't a people to believe it there wasn't a people to receive it but God looked before the foundation of the world and he placed the gift within these men's lives and you pastors and evangelists and in and and he placed them in this age because there would be a people that needed it amen and uh that would stay true to the message of the hour so God bless bless you as our prayer and uh we want brother Andrew to just make himself at home of course this is his home church and um we love uh appreciate brother Andrew and sister Mariah and uh appreciate his ministry he's been a blessing uh to people all around the world and it's hard to believe a young man uh such as him has is has got a worldwide Ministry but it's not him that's promoted it it's God that's promoted it and and we've seen God bless him tremendously and we've certainly been blessed here and so we want him to just to preach whatever the Lord lays upon his heart but let's just sing this song God is so good amen I believe we could all vouch for that and amen amen sing that from our heart oh God is so good God is so good oh god oh yes

good to me and oh God is so good maybe we just slip our hands up to him tonight God is so good he inhabits the praise of his people is so good he's so good to me amen how many witnesses do we have here tonight that God is good God is faithful and God is true amen everything that he said he would do in his word he has done continuing to do because he is God Amen there's no God beside him there's no God above him there's no God with him he's God Alone amen and the greatest thing about it tonight is he's our God Amen we there's a spirit in our hearts that's bearing record with him tonight that he's not just the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Israel but he's our God and he's right here tonight to do exactly what his word said he would do you believe that tonight amen before we open the word let's just bow our hearts together for a word of prayer maybe you have a special need upon your heart tonight something you would desire from the Lord I believe he's here Amen to meet that need Heavenly Father Lord as we come here this evening we are indeed grateful to be called your children and Lord we're thankful for the faith that's in our hearts tonight dear God that Lord to be able to gather once again in your house with Believers of like Precious Faith Lord knowing that we're not here gathered in vain or gathering out of ritual or form or tradition but Lord we're Gathering here because there's a deep calling to the deep and Lord as we heard it spoken last night father you plac that thirst there from before the foundation of the world you placed something in us that Lord in the end time your Prophet said you could look all the way through the ages and you could still see yourself in a group of people people and Lord the only way that was possible was you placed a a thirst inside of us that Lord when the world was thirsting for the things of the world we would be thirsting for you and Lord as we come here tonight once again to drink from that Fountain Lord we've heard it's an inexhaustible Fountain so father there's many hands that's been raised here tonight Lord I know we're in the sixth service of this meeting Lord but father I know you still have healing you still have Deliverance father Lord you're still here to exercise your Authority and your power in our situation so God we invite you tonight may you bind the hand of Satan may you bind the hand of sickness oh God may you bind the hand of discouragement father and Lord may your word just find free course in the heart of your children we commit this service in thy faithful hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you tonight we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and my sure is an honor and a privilege to be here tonight to have this privilege to speak to you and we thank you brother Shawn for the opportunity the invitation to speak tonight and we just pray that something can be said to be a blessing to you and a help and amen I was just hearing the prophet of God today he was talking about the meetings he said you know they're calling a lot of these meetings these days are calling and protracted meetings he said but we don't want protracted meetings he said we want revivals and he said ProTrac of meetings are meetings that go on and on and on and on he said there's nothing wrong with it he said but we want a Revival and I thought here tonight we have might maybe got with a ro would consider a protracting meeting uh over two or 3 days but it's been a Revival amen and I believe hearts and lives have been refreshed and so if you have your Bibles tonight we invite you to the Book of John the 15th chapter we want to say we sure have enjoyed the ministry of our brother Wayne brother Josh the Lord just using them in a powerful way and we sure appreciate all the visitors here tonight and those that's come just to bring your licks of fire together amen I believe he's here tonight don't you amen The Book of John John the 15th chapter and I want to read in the fifth verse and then John 15 15 and 16 but in the fifth verse Jesus here speaking he says I am the vine and ye are the branches I love how he positionally places himself and places us he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing I believe we can all raise your hands and say Amen there now in the 15th verse he speaks again and says henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends so now he's bringing into a closer relationship for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you he withheld nothing of Revelation now in the 16th verse he says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you now in the book of Acts the 2 chapter the book of Acts the 2 chapter in the first verse I know we know these scriptures by heart but in Acts chapter 2 and verse number one Speaking here on the Holy Spirit falling on the day of Pentecost and filling the Believers in Acts chapter 2 and verse one the Bible says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord somebody say one Accord one Accord they were all with one Accord in one place so they're speaking of unity with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind notice this and it filled all the house where they were sitting amen it filled all the house house where they were sitting they were in one mind in one Accord and the Holy Ghost filled all the house where they were sitting we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen I I want to tonight by the help of the Lord for just a few moments to speak to here and if I title this tonight I want to speak to you on the power of Harmony amen the power of Harmony I I believe that that there is a very powerful uh ele El of Harmony that the devil does not want in the church now in the message question answers 1954 brother B says this he said the main thing above everything is to keep the church in Harmony and in love of God and moving on if we can all believe that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and unrighteousness he said if the woman sitting next to you or the man sitting next to you if he doesn't believe that Jesus will actually come visibly again he said well let's just believe it and go right ahead anyhow he so we don't agree with him on the scripture but let's make the church move on for harmony because in there we're going to catch some more people amen so here the prophet of God is identifying that in harmony there is the ability Amen to actually manifest the desire of Jesus when he said I'll not just make you Fishers of fish but I'll make you Fishers of Men so power uh Harmony has the power to draw more people said he said now watch but when the church is out of Harmony he said then you hurt the church then you hurt the ca so as long as the church is in harmony amen there's a power to draw more people in there's a power Amen to further the cause of Christ but when the church gets out of Harmony he said then you hurt the church and then you hurt the cause another place he said I believe that everything in the natural line amen Works in harmony or should with the spiritual so everything working in the natural Amen in line with the natural should be working the same with the spiritual again in the Inside Man 1953 he said now let their faith just meet that condition and it'll be for thou has said as thou Hast believed in thy heart so shall it be and I pray that you'll grant that tonight and make the whole atmosphere Lord a creative atmosphere of one soul of one mind of one Accord and one purpose he said my heart so hungers to see that atmosphere see the atmosphere is what brings it if every person here would get in one Perfect Harmony it would be settled amen if every person here would get in one Perfect Harmony it would be settled see like the natural way for an egg to hatch it amen put it under the H and it'll hatch because it's the atmosphere it's warm but you just wrap it in a blanket keep it warm it'll hatch anyhow but put it in an incubator it would hatch anyhow see it's the atmosphere amen that brings the results it's the atmosphere that brings the results can I give you one more he said now this person what if you could ever get this Soul on the inside so in harmony with God that your soul and God would be one together then you could ask what you will amen and it shall be given unto you I do not believe that that is in the future I do not believe that that is in the past amen but I believe that God of Mark 11 is right here in this building tonight amen to manifest the desires of the heart of every believer amen I believe that God desires Harmony in the church how many would agree that God desires Harmony in the church amen I'll say this Lucifer hates Harmony amen and he will do anything that he has to Amen to see that the harmony is broken amen let me say this Lucifer uses Discord Amen to break up Harmony amen the Bible tells us in Proverbs 6:19 amen that there are seven things that God hates in the 19th verse it says a false witness that speaketh lies amen and he that Seth Discord among the Brethren now look at this word strife it means Discord amen or or Strife or contention now brother B says this one thing God hates is sowing Discord amen among the Brethren that's right and thems the organizations is what does it see it SS Discord among the brethren we should be standing in the breach saying amen that we are brothers amen amen how many tonight could say Lord I'll take a pledge to what a prophet said amen that we should not be standing in the breach causing more Division and more confusion and more more strife and more Discord amen but we should be standing in the breach saying we are brothers Amen brother said I believe in the fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man he said and I think we're brothers together and that's the way we should be and God has his children and maybe some of them are a little odd to our belief or your belief or mine amen but God has accepted them as his children amen so we have to accept them as our brothers and our sisters Amen Let me just go ahead and preach this since I'm here amen just because they're odd to us don't mean they're odd to God Amen because you may be odd to them and they may be odd to you amen but God has accepted them amen as a part of his Plan of Redemption amen he saved them he Sanctified them filled them with the Holy Ghost amen I think it's time to get back to Harmony I think it's time to get back to Unity I think it's time to get away from all the confusion all the different doctrines and come back to the homeland of the church which is the message of the hour amen and that is where our Unity is That's the basis of our fellowship now many people think when you go to preaching on Harmony amen and unity in the body that that it's really not that important you know we we've moved on to deeper Revelations and more more understanding amen but I believe that it's more important than we realize because I'll tell you why amen we must be in harmony or in tune with God in order to declare the super natural amen we're not here to declare another church service we're not here to declare another service we are here to declare the Supernatural and the prophet said in the message Fellowship by Redemption he said in the fourth dimension amen people can prove that right through this room now is coming radio activity radio messages they're coming right through this building now is coming television pictures but it's too fast for our eyes he said now you go millions of miles beyond that Dimension and you'll get into a place that's just as real as television pictures is in this room here this morning he said and you'll see that there's the Lord Jesus Christ he said the resurrected Son of God standing there and the reason that you cannot see him is because our heart hasn't become tuned down to it amen our heart has not become tuned down to it he said and the reason we can't see the television picture is our bodies are not set as instruments to pick up mechanical s things but when our body becomes in tune with God becoming a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Holy Spirit to vindicate amen the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power and his omnipotence amen well don't get mad at me tonight but for six Services amen there's been radio waves coming through this building and ain't nobody picked them up there's been television waves coming through this room and ain't nobody picked them up amen but there's been prophetic word and there's been healing there's been Deliverance there's been Miracles there's been anointing and it's been flowing through this room amen and people have been picking it up do you know why they're picking it up it's because their heart is not tuned to what's happening down here what's happening over there what's happening back there their heart is tuned to one thing and that is Jesus Christ is the Son of God he is raised from the dead he is the god of his word he is the god of his spirit and he's here in power tonight listen you're not an instrument to pick up complexes you were not sent here to pick up depression you were not sent here to pick up cancer you were not not sent here to pick up sickness you were sent here in this Dimension to declare that Dimension is just as real as this Dimension now you know the Father's prayer in the model prayer he said father let thy kingdom come and let thy will be done on the Earth as it is in heaven in other words there's people on the Earth that's already manifesting the power of Heaven because they're in tune with the god of Heaven he has risen from the dead he lives among us today and he wants Fellowship back with his people again his great Majesty his glory is now spreading forth and he's Desiring to Fellowship again with his people like he did in the Garden of Eden so the fall in the garden actually came in and it caused man to get out of tune with God it caused man to break harmony with God Amen and when Harmony is broken amen there going to be repercussions brother said my mother-in-law come to me when I was going among the p costals and she said you're not taking my daughter down there among that trash he said well she's my wife he said she said he's my daughter he said now listen she looked at me and said I'll go to my grave heartbroken now watch what brother said he said and instead of listening to God Amen I listened to the woman he said and then sorrow said in immediately he said the 1937 flood come up Sorrows begin to break in things went wrong at the church he said the congregation begin to drop he said just get out of harmony with God one time he said in friends I'll always regret it as long as I live now you say brother Andrew he was a prophet so surely amen he could get out of harmony with God and God wouldn't correct him because he was a prophet God wouldn't God wouldn't bring him back in line amen but do you remember the Bible says that God is no respect to persons amen and that word respect to persons means the fault of one who when called on to give judgment has respect of the outward circumstances of man and not of the inner marit so watch amen the Propet of God brings it on down and shows us here I'm laying a foundation brings it on down and shows us that God is not a respect of persons for anybody he said he's not even one for America he said America was founded amen upon biblical principles now I know it's hard to believe amen but at one time America was in harmony with God at one time America was in tune with God so much that when they signed the Declaration of Independence the prophet said that there was an extra chair sitting there he said and I believe that the Son of God came down amen and set in that chair while they signed the Declaration of Independence he said see but this nation has gone so far he said somebody told me today he said brother Brandon you mean to tell me that God would let America be overrun I said God never did say to America what he did to the Jews down there the Israelites but when they got out of harmony with God Amen God let them go that's right he said I tell you brother amen what you sow is is what you reap amen now can I preach that point for a second because we always automatically apply that to the negative that if you're so bad you're going to reap bad if you're so bad you're going to reap bad amen but why have we got to leave it in the negative amen why can't we bring it over into the positive amen if a person can s negative and they can reap negative amen I believe a person can s positive amen and they can reap positive amen you may not see it right now amen but these meetings you've been sewing amen you've been sewing in the kingdom of God you've been sewing in the atmosphere you come on church amen your pastors have been sewing in the churches your singers have been sewing in the churches listen meetings like this don't just happen overnight amen meetings like this don't just happen because some special preacher sewed up amen but there's been men of God sewing in local churches and when the Believers come together and the anointing begins to settle amen you begin to reap the benefits of all those Wednesday nights and all those Sunday mornings well I might as well preach since I'm here if we've been doing that in this Dimension amen then what about all that we've been sewing on the other side one of these mornings we're going to reap a new body one of these days we're going to reap a resurrection one of these days we're going to reap the future home what you sow in the negative you will reap in the negative and what you sow in the positive you will reap in the positive and this is a positive message yes sir it's a positive message amen that God by the New Birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has made a way for harmony to be restored brother said the new birth is an experience right he said it's a gift of God it's the Seal of your faith how many knows Paul said grieve not the holy spirit of God Amen whereby ye are sealed until the day of your Redemption he said God made the promise to Abraham and Abraham believed God and was justified by faith and God give him the sign of circumcision as a seal so he does today we believe him and then if you say you believe and do not receive the Holy Spirit then you do not believe because God promised Amen to give you the Holy Spirit when you did believe see now in believing you do not receive the Holy Spirit when you believe for Paul said have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed he said and when the spirit of God comes into a man it quickens him and then he becomes a new creature he believes in the immortal God he believes in all things that he does and his heart is in tune with God Amen now can I say this to you I know we've been having some powerful Services some mighty manifestations of God and I say this the devil's not happy the devil's not happy and the devil does not well some of you all come in these meetings and your heart was out of tune your spirit Was Out Of Tune your family and all kinds of situations amen but God by the word through the spirit amen has tuned your heart back up to God Amen can I say this no matter what happens amen stay in tune with the supernatural no matter what tomorrow holds no matter what next week holds no matter what the future holds you stay in tune with the god of your salvation you stay in tune with a God Amen that can make a way out of no way you stay in tune with a God that can deliver from the fiery furnace he said no matter what you got here in this world what you haven't got keep your heart amen right in tune with God he said now if that's right with God or heart he said then you'll come forth again just as certain as there's a God in heaven if it's not right with God you got to take the other route see you got to make a choice now you may say brother Andrew my heart being in tune with God it's really not that important well let me say what brother Bron said he was asked a question brother brandom why would Christ appear to me as I was about to take the sacraments so here's somebody coming to the communion table and all of a sudden brother Josh Christ just appears to him him and they're they're they're they're they're caught off guard so to speak and they say why would this happen and brother said no doubt your heart was just in tune with God Amen as you was walking to the communion table your heart was in tune with God and you was coming sacredly up to God to do it he said and that's why he appeared to you I tell you friends I want my heart to stay in tune with God I want my spirit to stay in harmony with God I don't want to show up on a Wednesday night and him not appear to me I don't want to show up on a Sunday morning and him not appear to me I said God if you could put me in tune in a Revival you can keep me in tune on Monday you can keep me in Harmony on Wednesday don't ever let my heart Get Out Of Tune and out of harmony with you now this word harmony is a very powerful word harmony means the combination amen of simultaneously sounded musical notes Amen to produce cords amen and cord progressions having amen a pleasing effect then so listen you can have the chords you can have the notes you can have the sheet music but unless you've got Harmony it's not going to have a pleasing effect it's the quality of forming a pleasing and a consistent hole amen Harmony is very important in musical Productions amen because the purpose of music is to display Harmony the purpose of music is to display the ability of Harmony now in St John 5 with that in mind we see that Jesus goes by the pool of bethesa he passed many people brother Brian but he went to one man who was an impotent man who had been in that condition for a long time and the Bible said that Jesus healed him on the Sabbath day and the Jews rose up a fuss right they said why are you healing on the Sabbath day and Jesus looked at him and said my father worketh hitherto and I work amen therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath but said that God also was his father amen making him equal with God now do you all know that there's only there's one type of Harmony that they call the best kind of Harmony you know what kind of Harmony that is they call it family Harmony amen and they break it on down into harmony between a parent and a child oh are you hearing me they break it on down between a parent and a child and that's a that's a special kind of Harmony that's the best kind of Harmony and here Jesus is doing things but he's not doing it C he wants to or on the whim or because he feels like doing it but he's doing it because he's in harmony or in tune with another dimension and that Dimension is where his father is and so his father is in that Dimension and then he is in this Dimension but they're so in tune that what the father wants done the son is picking it up and the actions of the son is manifesting the desires of the father listen church this is not just a Pentecostal age this is an adoption age where the authority of the father will be manifested in the actions of the [Applause] son we're not just in tune with CNN we're not just in tune with Fox News we're not just in tune with Israel news we are in tune with another dimension amen and that Dimension is a perfect Dimension that Dimension is a clear Dimension that Dimension is an anointed Dimension that's why we're not bound by the things of this Earth that's why we're not looking at wars and rumors of wars we are looking to the unseen Jesus said un them verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise so brother brother will they were so in harmony that what the father showed Jesus to do he went and done it brother said when he passed by the pool he seen all the people and he healed a man and the Jews questioned him why he said I do nothing but what the father shows me I can't do nothing but whatever he does he shows me and then I go do it remember said and we notice him that he was a kind man how many believe Jesus was a kind man he was a humble man yet he was a man of power I'm going somewhere he was a kind man brother M he was a humble man but yet he was a man of power when he spoke he was very humble and gentle but when it come time between to separate between the truth and the error amen Jesus was very Stern when it came to truth and error he didn't put gloves on and become a politician and say well I don't want to mess with this I don't want to speak it that amen he was very Stern when it come to truth and error remember said see when it come time he picked up some ropes and tied them together and kicked all the money changers table beat them out of the temple called the Pharisees those religious people a bunch of Hypocrites a bunch of serpents a bunch of Snakes in the Grass and all these things see he was a man who could speak when it come time to speak he was a man who was full of love but he loved his father so much until he stayed in harmony with his father and anything I'm preaching to you now anything that interfere with that Harmony amen Jesus draw the line come on Church anything that begin to interfere between the harmony of him and his father is where he drew the line he loved the Pharisees but when their false Doctrine begin to interfere with that Harmony between him and his father he drew the line he loved the SAG se but when their traditions and the rituals begin to interfere with the harmony between him and his father he drew the line well may I say there is again another Bride on the earth tonight who when anything begins to interfere with her Harmony between her Lord and her heart she will draw the line and say Satan you've gone as far as you've going to go you know what I feel like preaching right now I think this was a line drawing meeting I think this was a line draw and meeting I think some people drew a line and said Satan you've gone as far as you're going to go you've interfered long enough you've deceived long enough you've confused long enough Satan hears the line anything somebody say anything that interfere with that Harmony there is where Jesus draw the line brother Mark you agree that brother randam had the same Ministry of Jesus Christ and watch what he said the only thing I'm here for is to follow the in instructions of my brothers as long as it don't interfere with the things that God has for me to do now think about that the same Ministry that was in John 5 had now come into brother brandham the seventh angel and he was still exhibiting that same Harmony between that Dimension and this Dimension now look at the word interfere it means to take part or to intervene in an activity without invitation or necessity it means to come into something when you wasn't invited to come into it I could preach there for a while amen there's a lot of trespassers amen that's interfered in your joy interfered in your peace interfered in your praise interfered in your worship they were not invited into your life they were not invited into this church they were not invited into your church then you know what I think it's time to do I think it's time to be Samar I think it's time to draw a line and say you've interfered as long as you're going to interfere come on I know what I'm talking about some of you all want to praise God right now so bad amen but a complex is interfering with your praise amen and old spirit is interfering with your praise but I would to God you would shake that thing off tonight and say I'm going to praise God there ain't no complex there ain't no Spirit there ain't no Strife there ain't no contention there ain't no division going to interfere between the harmony between me and my father things come in and they were un invited so it's time to show them the door it means to prevent a process or an activity from continuing or being carried out properly it is of a thing Amen to strike against something when working Amen to get in the way of now can you remember this one Amen to interfere means to handle or adjust something without permission it means to handle or to adjust something without permission especially so as to cause damage can I say this to you tonight amen Satan is the master of interfering have I got any Witnesses here tonight amen he comes in your home when he's not invited he comes around your babies when he's not invited he comes on your job when he's not invited the prophet of God said we find that Satan right quickly amen goes to work against God's program he said we see that malignant eye of the devil that serpent that always tried to interfere with God's program before it comes on the earth amen Satan is trying to interfere with the program of God before it comes on the earth he said because he always knows when it's coming mostly now do you know that the devil got on daan and cor brother Malachi the devil got on them to interfere with the program of God in delivering his seed by a vision given to Abraham and the devil tried to interfere with their Deliverance but can I say this it didn't work the devil got on Janice and Chambers at the hour of liberation and tried to impersonate the sign of Moses Amen to interfere with the Deliverance of the seed of God Amen but it didn't work amen and that same old devil has come right around the ranks of this message Amen in the time of the Third Exodus in the season of body change in the season of rapture and he's trying to interfere with your rapture he's trying to stop your rapture he's trying to stop your future but I want to put that devil on notice tonight he didn't have enough to stop it then he don't have enough to stop it now and he won't have enough to stop it tomorrow there is going to be a bride there is going to be a Rapture there is going to be a resurrection there is going to be a millennium there is going to be a future home and devil you can do everything you want to but you will never stop amen the program of God from coming to pass we are in harmony with God we are in tune with God and there is a declaration From Another Dimension that that Dimension just real as this Dimension and our hearts are saying we came from God and we're going back to God we didn't come from Lea Sister Janet we ain't going back we didn't come from the son of predition so we ain't going back we came from the son of man so we got to go back we came from eternity so we got to go back now now you know that devil interfered with Moses can I say this brother B said like this very beautiful he's preaching in the message earnestly contended for the faith actually in carsville Indiana he's just preaching along you know just having a good service and the Devil comes in and interferes he's just preaching along he says then you say oh no I don't believe in Divine Healing I don't believe in all that racking carrying on believe in all that shouting praising God and crying tears running down your cheeks I don't believe in all that I know there's no such thing as that see it shows you haven't got it that's exactly right here was a man right up there balum was just as fundamental and just as right as just Doctrine as Moses was but Moses had healing he had the signs he had a big Pillar of Fire amen hanging over him are you are you catching the picture brother BR is just preaching away brother sea is just having a good service and he says hallelujah I hope you get it the pillar of fire hanging over here right now and he comes down and he says now look then he said let me die that death of the righteous then if you go to your table in the bracket you'll see these words brother randam stops as a model airplane noise interferes you can read it right there in the message brother Bram stops as a model airplane noise interferes then brother BR says hey see how the devil will do now if you want to see the devil look out there he got in them men out there to get them to do such things as that now if someone said do you mean that was the devil what other thing would interfere with God's spirit but the devil so here is a prophet oh I feel good right now here is a prophet preaching and a model airplane amen interferes with noise in his preaching in other words here is the astronaut age Prophet amen standing behind the pullit trying to tell the people you're not chickens you're not airplane pilots you're astronaut people and an airplane noise interrupts his preaching but he didn't lay down and say well I guess we're airplane pilots he said no amen the devil will try to stop the meeting but you cannot stop God I said you cannot stop God God will move right on just the same there's nothing simply nothing can stop God or the power of God he said the same people amen tried to stop it but they failed are you hearing me in other words nothing can interfere with this message I'm preaching to you now nothing can interfere with your body change nothing can interfere with a predestinated seed that's on the inside of your heart Jesus said the things I do shall you do also how could he say that because there was a Harmony between the father and the son this is God's sworn Covenant and it's true R said then Jesus is here how many will agree Jesus is here his spirit is here then what just happened now amen now can I show you something here's a prophet trying to preach and the devil interfere and try to break between the fault and interrupt the meeting amen but here's a prophet who said now what just happened I went into another world it's an Unseen World see we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an Unseen World and it's greater than anything you can see and here's Christ in this world in this building here are evil spirits and War and Christians is Anointed and the angels of God encamped about them trying to energize them with faith and here I am standing just yielding myself and the holy spirit's moving this is what you call Heavenly places church but remember Satan's always a skeptic at the sons of God I'm bringing on down home now he wasn't just trying to interfere with Jesus and his father he wasn't just trying to interfere with brother brandham and his father but he's a skeptic of the manifested adopted sons of God and the prophet said someone with a skeptic idea is just trying to interfere but Christians always overcome don't you ever forget that church that Christians always overcome there's never one time that Christ does not overcome there's never one situation that Christ does not overcome in Christians always overcome when God wants to display his power nothing will interfere with that now can I say the reason why the devil's fighting you the reason why the devil's TI in your life is because the same Harmony that was between the father and the son has now come into existence between the groom and the bride this harmony is now to exist see the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants to done with his word and she oh God she performs the command of the word in his name right for she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered amen and it comes to full Harvest amen serving its purpose amen can you say that with me serving its purpose you are a seed of God in this dimension in tune with that Dimension with a mind that has thus sayith the Lord and you are serving your purpose you say brother anderw I'm a young person I don't have a purpose well let me say this brother M said you had two every believer here has two purposes the first purpose is he is a fruit Bearer the second purpose is you are a lightbearer and brother Bram said we are God's fruit bearers he said now the vine puts forth the fruit but the branches amen has to Bear the fruit if the branch is getting its life out of the vine well it's the same kind of life that's in the vine don't you think so it has to be now our hands our lips our eyes them's God's hands lips and eyes we have here he has on earth now he's gone back to God and sends forth his energy of his Spirit to anoint us with the Holy Spirit and then if we are submissive to him then our hands represent his hands he has gone back in that Dimension but he's not here without a representative if he is in us then our hands represent his hands if we are submissive to him that's the reason he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover don't you let some devil just isolate back to just a preacher or just a prayer line or just an altar call amen but if God is in your heart and the Holy Ghost is in your soul and the Seal of promises upon your life your hands is his hands and there's an energy flowing through your hands there's an anointing flowing through your hands you can cast out you can cast out Devils you can lay hands on your sick babies I'm just going to say it I believe there's going to be some fifth gospels that's going to have some fruit on the other side I don't believe it's just going to be preachers I believe there's going to be some Holy Ghost filled mamas that's going to have some fruit on the other side that's going to be able to stand there and say I was sick in my body one day but my mama laid her hand on me and rebuked the fever rebuked the illness and I was healed are you hearing me I'm not talking about a generation coming I'm talking about you I'm talking about you are taking the place of Jesus Christ on the Earth right now then the same Harmony in him it's the same Harmony in you and the devil can't stop it and sin can't defile it and demons cannot scare you out of it you are a Christian and Christians always overcome brother R said the church is the fruit Bears today somebody say today the church is the fruit bearers today not tomorrow today brother B said watch as sure as Adam and Eve had to be put in the same Spirit Christ and the church has to be in the same Spirit the same Ministry these things I do shall you do also so do you see what I mean they had to unite together flesh and blood and God had to come together and be one spirit and Jesus Christ and his church is one Spirit my Jesus Christ and his church is one Spirit how can the church deny creation how can they deny the things Christ told them to do how can they deny then say we are of Christ we are his fruit bearers ye are his lightbearers is this okay okay Jesus said ye are the light of the world you agree with that you are a city that is set on a hill and it cannot be hid neither do men light a candle put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth life unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father in Heaven are you hearing me you're in this Dimension but they're seeing your good works and they're glorifying your father in Heaven because there is a Harmony between the two Dimensions I wish I had the ability to break this down there's a connection between the two bit Dimensions he is in the Unseen we're in the seen and there is a fellowship through the blood and what he desires to be done in Leona he's doing regardless of the fact that Lucifer has become the god of this evil age brother we think Fe to be the lightbearers of this age to be ready to manifest how many can say I'm ready I'm ready to manifest the promised word for the age that we're now living in knowing that in the beginning you allotted out your word knowing that in from the beginning each age you allotted your word to that age and somehow we don't know how it ever happened but in each one of those ages as we look back upon the word we see that there was an anointing I'm turning the corner now there was an anointing that come in that age that fulfilled that word there was an anointing that in that age that fulfilled that word and in this day we are now living in there is an allotted word there is a promise for this age and we believe that the holy spirit is here on Earth now trying to find Hearts to manifest and to bring to pass by vindicating the word that's now prophesied for this day and this hour amen can I shake you out of your sleep tonight can I preach to you for a second amen get out of your feelings get out of your ideas get out of your complex get out of your excuses get out of where I come out of this family and I come out of this situation the angel of God is in the Earth today who is hunting out Honest Hearts who will believe this message and he sent an anointing in this generation to fall into your life and to cause you to manifest the promise of the age you're living in come on church we ain't building an ark because that's not the promise of this age we're not putting literal Blood on the door because that's not the promise of this age but we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man we're laid in the presence of the son and all the greenness is being Bak town because the promise of this age is a mature bride to take a Rapture in the moment in the twinkl of an eye may I say it and all hell can't stop it all Devils can't stop it we will overcome the devil can try to stop it but the anointing will break his back the devil can try to bind it but the anointing will break through the devil can try to defeat you but the anointing will cause you to say greater is he that is in me and he that is in the [Applause] world oh what are you saying belander I'm saying there's an anointing in this age and it's a word anointing and it's the anointing of Isaiah 10 that said the Yoke the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing and we just have church on Saturday afternoon we just have church for a few minutes can I get a testimony here tonight that the oak has been destroyed can I get a witness here tonight that the anointing of the word has destroyed the Yoke you say brother Andrew it broke the Yol then there's a problem because anything that's broken can be repaired and put back on you but if it is destroyed it is beyond repair it is beyond fixing it is beyond wearing again and I want to tell you this anointed word word has broke your complexes this anointed word has broke your sicknesses this anointed word has broken the devil over your past and has liberated you to marry this new anointed word the anointing shall be destroyed because or the Yol shall be destroyed because of the anointing can I say this the same anointing that destroys the yolk the same anointing that destroys the yolk is the same anointing that moves you as a True Believer to fulfill the word of God the same anointing brother Josh that released you from the hand of the enemy is the same anointing that put you in position to fulfill the allotted word that was prophesied for the age that you're living in I want to say this tonight we're not just church members we're True Believers we're not just we're not just we're not just social Christians on a happy go-lucky picnic we are believers of God who are here to manifest the prophesied word now listen the pro ask a question you all have heard me preach on this point before at home but I'm going to say it like this real quickly explain the difference between the spirit and the Soul well now that's a hard one but the first thing you are see you're a tringe being just like Father Son and Holy Ghost amen and father son Holy Ghost is three things titles rather going into one person which is Jesus Christ and your soul body and spirit but it takes them three to make you how many degrees it takes them three to make you the Messiah 61 he said when God in the inner part of a man in the inner part of a man a man is made up in the system of a Tabernacle in the outer courts the holy place and the holies of holies the Shak glory on the inside the veil now in Romans 66 Paul can I give you some scripture real quick I'm I'm going to lay a point in here in Romans 66 Paul said knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin Ephesians 2:14 for he is our peace how many believes he's our peace who hath made both one and ha broken down the middle wall of partition between us amen so in other words he's brought Harmony having abolished in his flesh the enemy enmity even the law of Commandments and contained in ordinances for to make himself of Twain one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby in Ephesians 3:16 that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with his might by spirit in the Inner Man in Ephesians 4:22 that you would put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that she put on the new man which is after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness in 2 Corinthians 4:16 for which cause we thinkt not but though our outward man perish but the inward man is renewed day by day in Colossians 39 lie not one to another seeing that you put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him can I say this the anointing is not striking the outer man it's not just striking your flesh but the anointing is striking the Inside Man and the prophet said the Inside Man is the spirit man he said now the inside man he said now there is God he said there's a conscience and there's a subconscious y'all know that there's God the word you got a conscience and then you got a subconscious remember said now watch if we start overseas by ship and there's a man sitting up here and he's the one who gives the orders the man goes down the ship to run the ship down here well he don't see where he's going but he just takes orders from up above see but way down in the midst of here in our hearts is the subconscious and it takes orders from up there now up here this conscience comes up to the platform brother B praise the Lord I have faith but right down there in that other little conscience said now you know you haven't see well if you can get this one and that one in harmony with that one then something's going to happen see until that does it well it just won't work amen all the orders you can have but it goes this way that way or this way they're just pulling your ship one way or the other and you'll never get out of the harbor until the conscience and the subconscious all comes into harmony you're going to stay in the harbor he said see but watch if they all come in agreement amen then something's going to move now can I say this if you have the Holy Ghost on the inside of your soul amen there is a Harmony in you that's working that maybe you don't even realize is working can I say it like this the prophet said now in you is God right you who have the Holy Ghost God is in you do you believe that now Jesus said I give you power let me show you the weakness of the church today by God's grace I give you power over unclean spirits and you'll cast them out in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink deadly things it will not hurt them did you read what Jesus said in his last commission as he was leaving he said they shall take up serpents and it shall not hurt them do you realize in Acts 28 I'm preaching fast cuz I'm trying to hurry in Acts 28 now watch this Paul is in a vision do you realize that yes he's Shipwrecked but he's in a vision and the vision said you're going to be Shipwrecked the vision said these things are going to happen but it also said you're going to stand in a certain place and perform a certain work and when Paul was Shipwrecked he got off amen and the Bible said that he was gathering sticks and when he was gathering these sticks there was a Venom a serpent that come up out of the sticks and bit Paul and the prophet of God said when he throw some wood down a great deadly Beast bit him and that Beast was so deadly till if it hit a person they usually Dro dead within a minute or two so the natives looked at him and said oh he's a murderer you know he's escape the storm but he's not going to escape the serpent he's going to die now look a moment Paul looked and seen it he seen this this and this all agreed and there was not a speck of fear and he remembered they would take up serpents and it would not hurt them he said so Satan's Fear cast It Out by perfect love he said and this this and this was all in Harmony and he looked at the thing and said well he just shook it off in the fire and got more sticks because he had a job to do he said well Paul aren't you afraid you're going to fall dead why certainly not I can't fall dead the holy spirit is in me glory to God I can't fall dead the holy spirit is in me so here's Paul there's God he give a vision you're going to stand before Caesar and the devil was trying to interfere between the harmony of God and Paul and while he was gathering sticks he was bit by a serpent but when the serpent bit him they was expecting him to die but he just shook it off in the fire and the prophet said the very holy spirit that made the heavens and earth had that man so charged with the power till the death and that thing of that serpent wouldn't even go in his body because his whole body was full amen of spirit the same as it was blood Hallelujah his whole body was full of spirit the same as it was full of blood in other words we would not even know that Paul was bit by the serpent had somebody not recorded it because he was in such harmony with God can I preach a minute he was in such harmony with God that when the serpent bit him when the serpent Li onone to him I believe it like this brother Caleb I don't even believe the Venom got in him I don't even believe the Venom affect him because the power of the Holy Ghost had him so in tune with that Dimension are you can I say it like this in other words Paul what's happening in your present cannot affect your future brother Mark what's happening in your present cannot affect your future but wait I'm serpent B but there's a Harmony the prophet said they done great Miracles why they were so perfectly in harmony with God that first church and Christian friend until we can get back to that we can argue squirrel quirrel and fuss with denomination and never get into it see it'll never work until all that comes into harmony until all that comes into harmony until all that comes into harmony now brother Andrew what are you getting at I'll tell you very I'll tell you very plainly what the Bible said if that's okay the Bible says amen that the last days the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith that's Bible some are going to depart from the faith amen now watch this giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils so in other words in the last days there's going to be seducing Spirits which a seduction is connected to a serpent so there's going to be seducing Spirits all the way from the from evees interpreter that's going to come into this age and they're going to seduce some and they're going to separate some amen but I love what the prophet said he said but the time has come for the signs to follow the Believers we're at the end time we're in the latter time we're at the time when men will be he high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are good they are heady and high minded see the time has come when they're teaching doctrines of devils and perverting the Bible's teaching into theories and theologies to draw groups of people away after them brother said the time has come that God and then the time has come for Jesus to come now can I say this the only time that's going to happen is at the time of the next change come on when seducing spirits and doctrines of devils will come into the pull pit will come into the church is the same time it's time for a change in the Sheep music are you hearing me is the same time that it's time for a change in the Sheep music you say sheet music well in 19 can I have a few more minutes in 1964 brother B introduces to us this thought in the message Shalom and he calls it a great Symphony he said God has a great Symphony now you say what is a symphony well a symphony is an elaborate musical composition and it's a full orchestra that typically moves in four movements it typically moves in four movements at least one of which is traditionally in a Sonata form now look at this four it moves in four well there were four death Messengers that eat the tree down but there were be four life Messengers that would restore the tree back and the prophet of God said you know what the symphony is it's a music It's a drama so they acted out amen are you with me now so if you're going to have a drama if you're going to have a symphony you've got to have some instruments to act out what's trying to be portrayed and the prophet said well that little Russian Symphony sometimes they act out on the drums what is it Peter and the Wolf he said you know it's about the little woodpecker you know goes down in the woods and they had the flutter and the beating on the drums and things and you hear it all as you go through the symphony I forget the name of it he says oh that Peter and the Wolf amen now watch he said they don't have little figures flying around they don't have little figures flying around playing flying around playing it out but they play it on drums and then brother Bram knocks on something else and makes the drums and sounds and things and it plays out it acts it out now watch this if you're going to have Harmony in the symphony amen you got to have some musicians and all the musicians have got to be in the same key brother B said they just cannot hold that key to the mystery how the Rhythm and the sounds of the tuning and so forth Rings it out it takes the key if you're going to have a symphony you got to have some musicians who are playing in the right key now brother B turns and says the word of God is like a great syphony he said now if you don't understand the symphony it's a big bunch of Racket to you amen if you don't understand it see amen now watch the key of symphony is the ability to understand it's all done by signs and motions but it acts out a drama in this Symphony now notice the only one that understands a symphony is the composer the only one that understands the symphony is a composer and those who are interested in knowing it and they know its changes and they know what takes place so there's only one person who understands amen why people are standing up and shouting at the word about a seven seal why they're shouting about seven Thunders while they're rejoicing about a third pole there's only one person that knows and that is the composer but the other people that know are the ones who were elected from before the foundation of the world to come into the Same Spirit of the composer who wrote the music and the prophet said so the composer he knows every move from the end to the beginning did you know that the one who wrote it up he composes this he knows every little Junction if he knows every Junction now watch if the composer knows it I'm moving on down if the composer knows it he said then so does the director if the composer brother Tim knows it then so does the director in order to direct it now you got it you can't twist your creedy mat because one little m of that stick or that sign one little Miss sign at adjunction would throw the whole Orchestra off it would throw the whole Symphony out now you know that's true the composer and the director has to be in the same Spirit In other words the power of Harmony that operated between the father and the son oh come on church I'm preaching to you now when Jesus went by the woman at the well he did not guess how many husbands she had he knew how many husbands she had when he went by when he went by by by zachus he did not guess about zachus when he went by Philip and Andrew he did not guess about them because one miscue of the sign from the director would throw the whole Symphony off are you hear me now that's why we got over 8,000 recorded discernments and prayer lines and prophecies and there's not one of them off there's not one of them off there's not one time that somebody's stops brother brandham and says no that's not right but every time every prayer line every waving of the stick every manifestation of the sign there was a that's the truth that's the truth you know why because the composure was coming In The Same Spirit into the director come on you know I'm telling you the truth from the composer it moves into the director and the prophet said that's why the minister and the word of God the great Symphony has been playing since the dawn of time he said now look amen the minister at the word has to not look over here and say I believe this ought to be this you ought to make it this way he has to go the way the shoot he has to go the way the sheet music says take it that's the way the gospel has to be preached the way the word says take it you know if you throw a Creed in there you got the whole thing messed up if you go to make the drama just exactly right can I move on he said now there will be no trumpet give an uncertain sound in this war he said now you see the comp supposer God who wrote the Bible it's all together the revelation of Jesus Christ and he know the changes and the times and in the man the director who is directing them with the sign of the age has got to be exactly with the Bible signs in other words brother Josh he's got to preach several sermons and say the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then who can prepare for the battle he said it's uncertain to everything you look at but there's one thing that's certain and that's Christ there's one thing that's certain and that's the composure there's one thing that's certain and that's the one who wrote the sheet music don't you listen to an uncertain sound You Believe Gospel you believe God's gospel in its fullness because the gospel has no uncertain sound now can I show you what brother RAM does he brings it from the composer right on down to the director and says now look the church has an uncertain sound he said the the churches and depending on what they did in college amen the true church but it's the living Holy Spirit in the church amen leading it and guiding it for showing it things to come like it did in the days of Titus amen warning them of things to come to flee the Wrath that is to come can I say this to you the seventh Angel's message is not an uncertain sound the seventh Angel's message is a certain sound that's right because coming directly from the composer down to the director and the prophet said this Seven Seals on the book the book will not the shelds will not be released until the message of the seventh angel so we are presuming but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding Vindicated truth amen now can I say what God did by this message by the message of the hour amen God I'm coming I'm coming down now God has put the church back in Rhythm brother Kevin and he's tuned them up amen and now they're back in Rhythm and they're back in tune with the sheet music in other words God the conscience and the subconscious all come in harmony Jesus was in harmony with the father and watch what the prophet says he said and today there's a symphony when they stand up and say the days of Miracles has passed it don't hit the right note see but when it gets in the right swing of it when it gets in the right swing of it amen and it gets in the right Spirit of it then how you going to do it until the spirit comes down of the composer listen friends it's been more than a preacher Spirit here this weekend amen but the composer Spirit has come down in these meetings and has moved across the church and some of us Was Out Of Tune some of us was playing in the wrong Rhythm amen but the composer come down and he begin to use a director he begin to use a five-fold Ministry and he begin to swing that stick he begin to say listen the message is the truth there's only one way to Rapture the holy ghost is still here the Supernatural is still available the Miracles are still happening and he begin to direct the composer begin to direct the director well I might as well go ahead and close on this if he brought it from the composer into the director then the same spirit in the director is going to come in the musicians The Same Spirit that's in the director in the composer is going to come into the musicians now I know I know this may sound funny but it's actually a true story in middle school I was in ban believe it or not I was in ban I played the trumpet I I I say I played the trumpet I tried never played a trumpet in my life brother will but I didn't want to play sports so I had to do something in middle school so I went to band said put me on the trumpet I blow the trumpet band director says all right you can play You Don't Know Much but we'll teach you okay I'm in I got the trumpet so I went through sixth grade and we played sixth grade music but when it comes seventh grade in sixth grade you're just sixth grade band alone so you have your own concerts you have everything just isolated sixth grade but when you come to seventh and eighth grade then you begin to play together so now you're in seventh grade but you're playing with eight gr eighth graders amen and now in our and come time for our Christmas concert Christmas concert band Mr Brown my band director he comes around brother Sean and he hands out a piece of music well I took the music I laid it up on the on the stand and I looked at it and brother Josh when I first looked at it I was like whoa that's a lot different what I'm used seeing so I had a director Mr Brown but then in the afternoons on Tuesdays and Thursdays I had an instructor so I went to my instructor and I go in one day and he says what do you want to practice today in your lessons I said well might as well practice my concert band so we get the music out I lay it down on the on the stand and he looks at it and he goes no no no you're uh your concert band not this I said no this is my concert band music he said no no no you're concert band you're seventh grade I said that's what he give me that's what the director give me he said no he said this is written on the 10th grade level wow this is written on a 10th grade level you're in seventh grade why do you have 10th grade music I said it's hard but it's what he gave me oh God it's hard but it's what he gave me so I begin to play it he said now listen here's what we'll do we'll fix this so he went in there and he began to dumb down the music he be to put some different some different keys and whatever he done he said I'm going to make it easier for you to play so I go back to Band the next day and we all get our music out and we all start playing and Mr Brown stops and says something's off in here something's off in here and I thought oh no and I just sat there you know and smiled I wasn't going to say nothing he said let's try again so he played again he stopped he said something's off in here I just sat there and smiled he said everybody lay your instruments down and don't touch your music stands so here he comes walking through looking all the music and he comes by me and I'm just praying Lord don't let him look don't let him look don't let him see don't let him see and he looks right at it and he says it's you I said me he said yeah I said no way he said yeah it's you I said me he said you're the one that's off I said I am wow I knew I was off he said you're off I saidwhat do you mean he said' I got a question he said who dumbed down this music who dumbed it down I said what do you mean he said who changed what I gave you I said well my instructor he said your instructor is not the director he said your instructor has got you sitting in here playing a different key than the rest of the band is playing and I'm the director he said Andrew the reason I gave you that 10th grade music is because it's time for you to realize that there's potential in you to play Above what you've been playing so the music was a challenge Amen to play above a sixth grade level to play above a seventh are y'all hearing me and God come down in this age and he passed out the sheet music and there's been a lot of change into it there's been a lot of instructors who's added and taken away and hacked and cut and put in and changed the tune but in the evening time in the evening time it shall be light again and there will be somebody who the potentials of God will be revealed in their life the devil said you can't play it so we tried to interfere with it the devil said it's too hard for you and he tried to interfere with it but the director said I see something in you and you're able to do it in other words in the end time the composer and the director and the musicians are all in In The Same Spirit are you hearing me can I close on this point can I close on this point get back to the director get back to the director get back to what he said come on now I know what I'm talking about get back to what he said I know brother Josh said something last night and it just come through this room when he said it he said listen the message is more true now than when it was spoke in he said it's more accurate now now and it was preached then and I thought to myself the devil could get a hold of that and the devil could try to twist that amen but that's a powerful statement because brother Josh said that amen preaching to a church full of people who was rejoicing at things come on friends that they heard back there but they did not understand come on Billy Paul heard future home and he walked out of there and brother Bram said Billy did you understand it he said sure did Daddy he said did you really understand it he said no I didn't he said said Billy I can count on my hand the people that understood that amen but here we are years later and there's young people in this building tonight who can understand things that was confusing back then Here We Are Tonight church and there's a bride on the earth who is not changing the Sheep music they're not dumbing it down they are just playing it Hall the composer the director and the musicians will all be in the same Spirit are you ready for this yes here the authenticated prophet of God who appears in last age what he says from God the bride will say the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing yes sir can I leave you with this the purpose of the symphony is to bring three parts into harmony to transform the sheet music into real reality so Brother Sam there's not woodpeckers flying around there's not a wolf flying around but there's a composer there's a director and there's musicians in the same spirit and they're playing out the great Symphony what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this our lives are a part of this Symphony can I read you Isaiah 12:1 the Bible said that day Thou shalt say oh Lord I will praise thee though thou was anger with me thine anger is turned away and thou Comfort us me behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid are you ready for this for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song he has also become my salvation therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of Salvation And in that day shall ye say praise the Lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted do you read verse 5 there and sing unto the Lord for he hath done excellent things listen this is known in all the Earth cry out and Shout thou inhabitant of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee can I tell you what that word sing means that word sing means to sing praise brother Sean it means to make music to play a musical instrument so in other words in the last days Jehovah oh God is going to come down in the church he's going to come from the composer into the director and he's going to come into the musicians and he's going to want to sing a song think about that Jehovah is going to want to sing a song but you all know if you're going to sing a song you got to have some musicians that know the song and can play the song and they're in the same King and then there'll be a Harmony and then there'll be a pleasing effect well do you know what the prophet of God said he said in 1964 in a message the unveiling of God he said there was an Old Violin one time he said they took that violin out there to the auction he said it was all crummy it was an old fiddle everything couldn't even get a bit on it he said finally somebody said I'll give you a dollar he said something like that can I say this to you the violin Was Out Of Tune the I'm closed on this point it was out of Harmony amen and it was at the auction are you awake it was at the auction because somebody got theault it was finished yeah somewhere somebody got the fa brother Josh nothing else can come out of this violin it's finished it's scarred take it to the auction and get rid of it amen you can't get no more music out of this violin but there was one standing there glory to God there was one standing there that didn't think it ought to sell for a dollar didn't think it ought to sell for $2 so he went up there and struck it in his hands and he picked up the bow and he be to rosing up the bow and he played a tune and we did everyone started crying they never heard such music like that in their life and then the auctioneer said what am I offered Sister Janet one said 2,000 somebody else said 4,000 somebody else said 5,000 somebody said 10,000 brother said see what was it it was the Master's Hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument the Master's Hand revealed what was veiled in the old instrument he said and it's the same now this book is ragged it's been laughed at it's been burnt it's been made fun of and it's on the denomination o and the World Council of churches but remember there is something the old book that is promiser would be a predestinated ordained hand come one day that would pick it up would pick up the Sheep music and would make the word this book through a predestinated heart to the task it's made for reveal the promises that's in it listen it depends on Whose hand the bow is in are y'all hear me it depends on Whose hand the bow is in in other words the violin was the word it was the Bible it's the message of the hour amen and the violin must have a bow and the bow is the believer so what does the bow do the bow lays across the violin and brings out the music of the violin in other words the prophet of God said Can't You Hear The Master's fol and pull across the bow across the word he's the same yesterday today and forever the Bible is the violin the believer is the bow when the master got a hold of violin he tuned it up and he laid the believer over on at the bow and he begin to strum across it and he begin to play out the sheet music of the message of the hour and listen Friends The Master's violin has been touched by the hand of the master as our musicians are coming the Master's violin the violin was at the auction because it had been manhandled it had been manhandled it had been mishandled it had been handled without permission it had been handled in a way Amen to to to hinder its progress it had been handled in a way to PR vent it from bringing the passage purpose yeah yeah Mark 11:23 Jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe somebody say believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said can I tell you what brother Ram said he said you can't stand here fumble in your mind and say you've got and say it you've got to be inspired to say it I looked at that word fumble brother Thomas it means to handle something or Clum ly aimlessly to make awkward attempts to carry something so you're trying to carry it you're trying to handle it aimlessly but watch a prophet he said but Jesus said have faith in God for verily I say unto you if you not if I if you shall send this mountain be moved and doubt doubt in your heart it'll obey you it have to it have to just the way you say it don't doubt now see now you believe it up here now let's get this subconscious believe in it and when the subconscious and this conscience comes in harmony with God then it will happen when the subconscious the conscience and God comes into harmony the Sheep music there will be a visible manifestation of [Music] reality I know what the devil does the devil takes some of us and the devil says we're finished I know what the devil does the devil takes some of us and he says we're finished we're done we need to go to the auction but then the but then the composure comes by yeah he gets in the director and he begins to stand there and he begins to say listen there's some songs that's got to be played somebody's got to sing the song of Salvation somebody's got to sing the song of redemption somebody's got to sing the song of Deliverance so he begins to take some instruments and you say brother I'm finished I can't be a part of God's Great Symphony after all these sermons after all the word I've been raised in the message there's no way I can be a part of this Symphony I've got too many scars well can I tell you what brother BR said he said one time I went into a room and there was a room there and he said it was full of full of people he said this young lady I said how do you do he said he said how do you do brother brandom I said well I don't know where to start she said perhaps start with me he said start with you he said this is an insane place he said what's a pretty girl like you doing in an insane place in a straight jacket she said brother R you want to hear my story he said sure she said I was raised up in a Christian home went to church started going with a boy and smoked and drank he said God all kinds of trouble now watch and I said well that's a shame pretty woman like you he said now don't you think that having a husband sometime or babies in woman like that be lady about her at all she said oh yes brother BR she said who would have me though what can I offer he said now just kept catching her spirit and he said all of a sudden I said what's wrong she said now look she said I want to be changed he said well let's get down and pray I said you pray now she began to pray oh God she prayed and prayed and after a while she got up looked at me she said brother BR it's different I put my hand on her shoulder I said God bless you she said I believe it's all over now I'm going to go out here and try to live a different life I said sister you go out and live the same life you live see I said you're just turning a page I said it's not right yet so I said let's pray some more now watch what brother said brother Josh said and we got down and we kept praying and after a while she struck something he said then it changed yes sir from like a little kid picking on music till it went to making music yes sir it got some rhythm in it you know and after a while she got to praying and after a while she be to scream and the tears run down her face amen she raised up them great big eyes and said brother Bram Something's Happened I said yes sir he said she's married today and she's got three or four children he said what was it she took God and stayed with it till actually something happened he said and something taking place amen The Living Word the Sheep music becomes a living reality to her and when God plants his promise in you and it becomes a living reality then something is different you don't just go and say yes I believe it that's all right no the devil believes it like that but it's confirmed to you and the word becomes alive in you then you begin to see what it is won't you stand your feet with us tonight a Prophet come along and picked up the picked up the violin dusted the cobwebs off of it clean the scars up off of it and he found a bow in an instain institution all scarred up but he knew the word was in tune he just had to get her in harmony he just had to get her in tune [Music] and he took that word and he laid her life brother Josh he laid her life across that violin and begin to play out Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today he begin to play out he delivers from sin it begin to play out he's a restore it begin to play out things are going to be different he he changed her tune from nobody wants me to she was married with four children it's the power of Harmony Church when you get back in harmony it'll bring a pleasing effect across the word and it'll change your future it'll change the way you see things Hallelujah I don't know about you tonight I say Lord I want to be in tune all the time I want to live in tune with this [Music] word I want to be brother Bill I want to be able to be laid across this word and let Jehovah sing a song how many believes Jehovah wants to sing anybody believe Jehovah wants to sing you believe Jehovah wants to sing the songs of his word you believe that he wants to use you as the bow on the violin hallelujah how many raise your hands and say Lord I'm I'm willing Heavenly Father Lord all across this building building tonight is musicians Lord father the composer spirit is in the building the director Lord we have the Sheep music he showed it to us Lord he laid it out he preached it around the world Lord You've raised up five-fold ministry under the voice of the seventh angel to say exactly what he said so father maybe today the director maybe physically is not here but Lord you've got word directors that are taking that music and they're compo they've taken the composer spirit and Lord there's a lot of enemies trying to interfere with your program they're trying to interfere with your Display of Power they're trying to interfere with what you're Desiring to do in this generation but there's a lot of spirits trying to bind and hold down but Lord I believe there's a I believe there's a liberty in your word I believe there's an anointing in your word that destroys the Yoke of the enemy and Lord I believe that anointing will bring into harmony father every musician Lord I believe you could take this word the violin Lord you can take these bows these Believers here and you can lay them across that violin and they can begin

Christ if there be one here tonight Lord that the enemy is trying to interfere with the noise and change the Sheep music Lord maybe some of them was playing Out Of Tune before these meetings started they were the devil had them playing his tune and had him playing his rhythm but Lord your spirit come by and tuned us up now Satan wants to interfere with that he wants us to Fumble around in our minds and our spirits that Satan you are defeated in the name of Jesus Christ father I pray Lord that you would keep us in tune with your word may we sing the songs of Zion father may we be
