the more our hearts yearn to see him face to face and the things of the world just Fades from view nothing really seems to matter then amen and I just love the Lord and I trust you're glad to be in the house of the Lord beautiful day to serve the Lord amen good to have our sister with us God bless you and just everyone in the house of the Lord the musicians can be dismissed and you can have your seats for just a moment just to make a announcement first of all um April 7th which will be on a Friday we're planning on setting up the tent I think I had announced another date but we've decided uh that that the seventh would work better for some of the Brethren so any of you Brethren that would be able to help us with your the needed we'd really be thankful for that and if anyone just in and wants to help you know during the meeting with different things um it would definitely be a big help to us and um also I had announced a while back uh about maybe going to taking a trip to Pennsylvania um to see The Sight and Sound I don't know what their plan maybe David or something like that but it's a it's if you haven't been to Sight and Sound you would enjoy it I believe but um last year we did that several of us were able to go and and really enjoyed it and so um uh we we plan to see the the the play on Friday evening of June 2nd June 2nd Friday evening and um but we have rooms reserved for June 1st and June 2nd so Thursday and Friday uh the the place that we have the rooms reserved it's a it's a small motel it's locally owned and uh American owned and so uh they're clean the rooms are clean and they're they're simple uh rooms but um so you know I don't think they got that big old television you know that the others have or anything like that so just in case you know you need to get prayed through or something but uh uh uh like I said it's just it ain't got a lot of your Commodities at your big rooms would have but um um they they are clean and and last year well we we stayed in them a few years or any time that we've gone um but last year different ones stayed there and they really uh liked it and they're wanting to go back to that place so we do have uh 10 rooms reserved and six are already booked so we got four rooms left and uh the owner of the motel since they're small uh they don't want to keep the rooms um they're not going to keep them four rooms uh too much longer so if you want to go let my wife know if you want to stay at that if you're wanting to stay at some nice resort or something you know by all means you do so uh but um and uh but if you're wanting to stay there um then let Heather know uh here soon so we can let the owner know as well and so um also if you're wanting to go to uh Sight and Sound with us we need to know no later than April 29th and because uh we we've we've got I don't know how many tickets but we we got a several tickets reserved but they're not going to keep them uh uh past that date um April 29th so if you would like to go just let us know and uh and also let's see um they um there's a certain day right that they won't refund you okay so so after this date um if you if you decide that you cannot

then something came up uh Beyond this date and then you say well man I'm not able to go we we would not be able to refund the money because or they won't refund us our money but you uh uh they will

know and um that way we can get everything taken care of Amen so uh I have just enjoyed the worship this morning and uh the worship uh you know it's uh it's good when the people come in free you know and just be able to Worship the Lord I've just enjoyed the specials um there and and uh you know I wanted to say I really appreciate all of you the uh your gifts we're we've got a talented church and uh you know and we all you know as hearing brother Brown the other day and he said we've all got something special to do and and I think that is so true whether it's cleaning the windows or uh directing the traffic or whether it's saying amen and being you know I just there's your everyone is special and um I thought of even you know just thinking of brother Walker and Sister Walker and I know sometimes you know they don't feel like they're they're they're doing much for the Lord but you know I I think of all the times that he had called me and and uh he calls me and say I'm I'm praying for you you know always praying for you and he just don't realize how special that is to me and uh but every one of us has got something to do for the Lord amen now let's just stand to her feet and um um and we're going to turn back to Ephesians 1. amen Ephesians 1. I think that's the the Devil he's good at letting telling us that we're not needed he's good at telling us that we're not important I even find that young people have such complexes of thinking that they're they're just of no value or of you know that they settle for the for less and I don't think you have to settle for less you are of value when it comes to the kingdom of God you're of value amen and um before we go into the word let's just bow our hearts and talk to our Lord dear father we just come to you Lord with Humble Hearts Lord just can't express enough of how thankful we are for all your blessings and Lord you bestowing your love Upon Us father Lord that you have chosen us for this day the greatest age Lord that the sages of old the Patriarchs the Saints have long for this day and here we are Lord and I know Satan would love just to to think make us think that we're just here coinced by coincidence Lord or just floating along the Lord you've called us for this Lord and every challenge that we face you've called us to overcome Lord you've given us the grace to do so and may we walk in your footsteps may we may we take courage this morning and I pray Lord that you would just anoint Lord both speaker and hearer bless the words that we would have to say God and may it be you speaking and bless the reading of your word as our prayer we ask it in your lovely name Jesus Christ amen and amen uh Ephesians the first chapter and I'm going to the 22nd verse I think it's it's very powerful done the well the whole book of Ephesians but but here it says and hath put all things everybody say all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that philth all in all amen you can be seated that feeleth all in all so I'm using this scripture a lot because not not just for repetitious but in yet it tells us as to what part we play in God's plan and if we if we those setting here this morning or maybe even listening in online if we are the church then we are his body no via fans or buts it's we are his body if we are his church and we're baptized into this body by one spirit amen and I'm so glad for that because that's the only way that we could be part of the body or the Church of the Living God I looked up this word body it it is the main Central or principle part the material part to give form or shape to the expression of and we know how that's true as as the prophet said we can't see one another uh because we're all Spirit form but we have fellowships by it through your body it's it's your body expresses you your body my body expresses me and whatever nature whatever character whatever I am my body expresses that and um we so we we find that God is without form for he is a spirit and and a spirit has no form but he took form he took he took form when he created the body of his son and came and lived in it ain't that right and and so the the Bible tells us what form and that is he took on the form of man a man and and so then then we find it to be true for Jesus when Thomas uh told uh approached Jesus saying um uh it would suffice us if if you would show us the father in other words we'd be satisfied if we can just see the father and and Jesus says but you know have I been so long with you and you still don't know who I am he that has seen the father hath seen me ain't that right and so God took on the form of man and brother Branham goes into you know talks about that form and tells us that the Greek word means in morpha and and he says which means he changed himself God came down and took on a form of man something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eye can catch it so he says he changed himself to what he was to what he is or his mask he changed masks uh to take on another act ain't that right so the ACT did not finish with Jesus in the god becoming in the form of man in the body of Jesus that Paul is saying that God has now taken on another form amorpha and that's the body of his church ain't that right so he's in morfa in his church which is his body as we know uh all that God was he poured into Christ and to think of that now all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ is he poured into the church amen so the same God that was in Christ is in the body of his church today and the body you you you think of it now you're the only people and when I say you the only people I'm talking about worldwide as as the Church of the Living God that can reflect as what God is without trying to interpret who God is God interprets his own self through his body ain't that rhyme amen so what God is his body reflects what character is on the inside of the body the body reflects what nature is on the inside of the body the body reflects ain't that right so we find Jesus being the body of God was the expressed image of God so much so that he says he that has seen me has seen the father now you know I I think someone had meant maybe a brother Wendell but how that that uh um uh and brother Branham you know did too where the woman said you know uh talking about Oneness and and uh he said you know she I think she was saying about you know that that Oneness is you and your wife that's the type of Oneness that Jesus was talking about and brother Brian said no that's not true and and he he and and he says you know me and my wife for one he said but do you uh do you see my wife here no he goes well then that's not the Oneness that Jesus is talking about because Jesus said he that has seen me has seen the father and and I I believe personally that we're coming back to that Oneness and and if you'd go listen to what brother Branham preached on on the message Oneness amen he gives this uh it tells us really what kind of Oneness is is is we're coming to ain't that right now now with that in mind if we are the body how can God be in you and the creative word not be in you how how can God be in you and the supernatural not be in you how can God be in his body and the body not reflect anything that he is and is reflecting something else ain't that right that's why we can't just settle down just being church members amen we can't just settle down just by uh uh knowing a Doctrine or knowing uh uh what brother Branham got done in brother Branham I think we ought to be able to identify with the Miracles that brother Branham uh uh that God done through brother Branham I think we ought to be able to identify with the Miracles that God done through Jesus Christ I believe that we ought to be able to identify with the same Supernatural God that was Identity or that was revealed or reflected in in them do you believe that a man so now uh we are his body and what God is is then the body is to reflect for God is dwelling in his own body you are not your own you've been bought with the price ain't that right when God redeemed you he did not just redeem you and then you just go happy go lucky and not knowing anything about God Amen but he did he redeemed you that he himself could possess you he possesses your mind he wants to possess your tongue he wants to possess your eyes he wants to possess these hands he wants to possess your whole entire body amen and his desire is to fellowship with you amen but to think of it not just the fellowship not just going around saying I'm a Christian I'm message believer I'm Christian you know but he wants an intimate relationship with you amen but not only just an intimate relationship with you but he wants to reveal himself through you a man to where the people uh at work the the the the the people that you meet your friends your family wherever you are the people can see Jesus Christ is alive today not by because you say so but there's an atmosphere that you create there is a supernatural uh thing about you that the world knows nothing of can you say man amen and this is not assembly line production this is God himself living inside of you producing his own works now we are living in a time where the world has left off from the Supernatural and if there has ever been a a time of human promotion it is today amen uh man's uh ideas being promoted Humanity promoted everything about man being promoted exalted lifted up amen and of the human mind the human achievements human work human intellect this is the promotion of man hey ain't that right whether it's by education or whether it's by science or technology G or whatever it's it's nothing but the promotion of man's intellects achievements and all that but in all of man's achievements he is unable to fix what chaos is going on the more he he brags about his intellect the worst chaos it gets amen the more uh achievements he he he comes up with a man the worse it gets I don't care if it's if it's a super church it's getting worse I don't care if it's a super government it's getting worse I don't care if it's a supernation it's getting worse ain't that right amen because it's nothing but man's achievements his and Man is full of death his works are full of death uh everything he does I don't care he comes with better foods and we're dying dying dying more more faster than ever we he come up with better cars we've become up with better way of traveling a better way of whatever to live and and and we're getting weaker and weaker and weaker amen and man is trying to stop this death he's trying to stop amen the train wreck that's coming and he can't do it he has no answers every promise that man makes is a false promise it's a false hope it's false ain't that right amen even your rich man your wealthiest men has got bunkers a Man Down Under the Earth to hide amen uh uh when when because they know catastrophe is coming and and and all their intellect will tell them is is if we get in a bunker we'll be safe but we know that a prophet said you'll never be safe can you say man the Bible says you'll never be safe you they're going to run they're going to cry for the rocks to fall upon them amen but but it ain't it ain't going to cover them from the wrath of God ain't that right so we we see we see this chaos that it's it's in the home life it's in the churches it's in schools it's in society governments and politics and and and you name it the chaos is there we see it working uh in in adults and and and yet then we see it working in teenagers now we're seeing it working in Little Children the devil possessing their minds and and and and they're becoming the puppets of the devil ain't that right to think of it a six-year-old would shoot his teacher just the other day about a six-year-old think of that how in the world could it come to that I'll tell you what it is it's the demon possession amen now the prophet already told us it's invasion of the United States Hollywood has invaded in our homes the devil has come into the home through Hollywood amen the murders and the blasphemies and the and and and the things the wicked acts amen has come right into the home where God don't feel welcome amen people say well it's just a TV show it's demons that are coming in to your home by way of Television can you say Amen it's demonic powers that is raping your mind amen rape and everything that God wants to use you God wants to God has created man for his glory amen but he's got to have a channel to work through ain't that right and our minds are so stopped up the people's minds are suit and twisted in this day we don't even know what motherhood is like anymore we don't even know what fatherhood is like anymore we don't even know what church life is supposed to be anymore you understand what I'm saying when I say we I'm talking about Americans I'm talking about the world over we think church is just joining up and sitting there amen like a knot on a log and having a 30-minute episode and then we all go home that ain't what a church is supposed to be amen it's supposed to be a life that is living inside of us amen above something that is moving inside our soul so you you you you play a big role you you are important you mothers are important amen you you young ladies that are uh uh keeping yourself pure amen you're important ain't that right keeping your body pure amen wearing your long hair living a holy life you're important you young men that's keeping yourself pure amen and and you're important in this age ain't that right and I say the more time goes the the the more valuable you become the more rare of a specimen you become because you're the Church of the Living God ain't that right you Elders hey man you're important you're important to these young people because you're living a life of godliness you're living a life that is consecrated unto God these young people need to see an example of a life before God can you say amen amen they're seeing all the junk that is out in the world Amen and Satan is bringing this all before their eyes amen but you're valuable sitting here this morning amen when you lift your hands you're valuable Amen to these young boys amen when you're praising God and you're getting into the house of God and you're being faithful to the house of God you're valuable don't ever forget that ain't that right your trials that you go through and they see you're overcoming your trials that's valuable to them that when they come into their trials they'll say I remember so and so I remember what they went through and they came through I can make it you're valuable [Music] ain't that right but we find it's certainly out of the control of mankind but we as Believers see that the supernatural God is controlling things Psalms 103 19 the Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth overall so see the God we serve is ruler Over All the god that we serve is not defeated the god that we serve when he speaks some things happen things happen not something things happen amen why he rules over all now you to think of that you're his body you are his body that this God that is omnipotent that reigneth overall decides to to live in he redeemed you for that purpose he called you for that purpose can you say amen and then he saves you in this for this time as such a time as this when it's the wickedest age when it's the darkest age and yet as the prophet said God decided and says I will defeat my enemy through them God would reserve a body in this age amen for the final moments amen when Satan would come in as a roaring lion he would take you amen redeem you and then come and live in you and defeat every enemy amen that comes your way oh yes this church is triumphant amen because she's the body of the triumphant God this church is Victorious because she's the body a man of a Victorious God this church Reigns Amen in this life do you believe that we're not victims we're not defeated we are literally reigning in our body because we are the Temple of Jesus Christ grace alone the word Supernatural means and I've read this before but I read it again to refresh your minds it means departing from what is usual or normal especially so as to appear to transcend the laws of nature and the word transcend is to rise above or go beyond the limits of so it it's it's it's going Supernatural rises above or goes beyond the limits of nature it means to triumph over the negative or restrictive aspects of it means overcome to be prior to Beyond and above the universe or material existence see to outstrip or outdo in some attribute quality or power so it we as Mortals we are confined to gravity but the supernaturalism so you understand how the Supernatural is going to take place amen uh uh we are limited as as mortal beings to the laws of nature but the supernatural isn't as mortal beings we are we are uh uh restricted amen our youth is restricted Amen to the laws of corruption but the supernatural isn't hey ain't that right amen see and so this is how God could take a man uh an old man that that could be feeble and bent over and all that and let that spirit of God so Quicken him amen he could be preaching and anointing strike him and that backhoe straightened up hey man he get to feeling young again because it's something Beyond Humanity ain't that right it's the supernatural that that transcends the laws of nature so the Supernatural is attributed to an invisible agent it supersedes overrides overpowers the natural and it cannot be explained by science a manifestation a Supernatural is a manifestation or event attributed to some Force Beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature so so there there's there's a lot of things there that describes the Supernatural and and and so the main thing we get is that that the Supernatural is unlimited it's it's it it answers to nothing whatever the supernatural whenever the Supernatural is is there the supernatural being here then we expect anything to happen amen it because it goes beyond the limitations of your your problems it goes beyond the the limitations of how you feel it goes beyond the limitations of your weaknesses it goes beyond the limitations of everything and so when we say that God is here then then it perks us up when we come to church and we say we come to meet God Amen and and we're under expectation to meet God well it's more than just coming uh Mortals coming together it's a supernatural God Amen uh uh coming and moving among his body working among his body and and whatever problem you have you don't have to have it any longer amen whatever sickness you've got you can leave here healed amen whatever discouragement you're going through amen there is a supernatural power amen that can go beyond amen the discouragement say man I've had it amen when I've come in with questions in my mind and the supernatural drop he will answer every question that I have because God is God he is Supernatural he is not on the level of human beings ain't that right and and so this is what God is this is describes God for he is Supernatural amen there is no mortal that can ever be compared to what God is amen and Mortal man can't even comprehend what God is and I think this is the the the the the lovely thing and the Most Blessed thing about being the body of Christ is because the Holy Ghost within us gives the understanding amen if we had not the Holy Ghost we would never be able to understand the things of God even though we we heard about the things of God I could tell you about the things of God that you could hear through a prophet you could see God in action and yet if you don't have something within you then then you would never know you would never understand it it would just you don't kind of give you a flat top as it goes by you know and and so but but when you have the spirit of God I I I take it like this and I've used this illustration and I hope it's okay to use it again but but you know it's it's like human Humanity with with with uh bug life the the intelligence is of if humanity is so far beyond the the intelligence of a bug and and you know I use brother Branson for for a moment but you know he's a fine looking young man and and and I'm sure you know that he'd like to uh uh have a home and and uh one of these days get married and you know these things got Visions plans and all that and and so but it it it wouldn't it be funny though and uh if if you come in with the ladybug on his arm you know I want his hand and then you put a little thing you you know you Gucci Gucci goo you know and and and he's talking to this ladybug and and I I guarantee you uh the parents would be like that ain't my boy you know he he he left and he's never come back I don't know who you are you know and and you'd say man you know Brent said man I can run I you know little girl I can run 20 miles in an hour you know I don't know if you can or not but we will dramatize here you know and and well he's telling the ladybug everything about himself and that ladybug just was just running around she's not comprehending nothing because the intelligence is two different things ain't that right it's a bug life versus human life now if she could get the spirit that little bug could get the spirit of human she could actually begin to comprehend what human Branson is saying about himself to her but but see his presence even though he's made all these achievements and and and these things and and to us you know we would look and say wow that that Branson he's he's very talented he's he's done this he's done this he's done that and this and wow that and we actually gain respect and and and this you understand what I'm saying I mean his presence like wow man I'm his buddy you know and and uh and and maybe someone else that don't know Branson would say well you you know him I mean I've heard about him I've I've read him about him in the newspaper saw him on the news and all of his accomplishments and things like that and yeah yeah I know him you know but but see everything that he is don't mean nothing to the ladybug you understand what I'm saying and and so his presence is unrecognized the the what he is is unrecognized by that little bug you understand what I'm saying that there's no Fellowship that could be had there's no relationship that could be had where you could just imagine now now we we I I'm just trying to go from from from One Life to another life very low and that's pretty low a ladybug versus a human that's pretty low you know uh uh uh change uh difference there but could you imagine how much more difference it is between God and man amen God is God God is supreme god reigns God God love wow God human human dialect can't even explain what God is give it a try you could speak a million words for for uh uh for so many years of God and just constantly describing God God God and you ain't even going to be able to describe him Amen to actually to what he really is but yet God chooses to have relationship with us God wants relationship now there's no way that that brother Branson could have relationship with that you know a fellowship with that that ladybug there ain't no way there's no way that that ladybug can comprehend she has no ability to comprehend well we have no ability to comprehend who God is amen even the prophet preach the message the presence of God unrecognized he could come in the midst and people don't even know who he is remember to think that God would choose us for relationship but the only way he can have Fellowship a man is for him to come himself and live within me can you say amen amen now I have and I have a higher intelligence than just human life because human life can't even grasp what God is but the Holy Ghost can can you say Amen so when God says I am that I am there's that Holy Ghost down inside of me that says yes Lord you are the I am that I am amen do you realize the times that we praise the lord it's the Holy Ghost quickening us amen just to glorify God well how do you know he's up there because there's something down inside of me that is telling me he's alive they're sucking down inside of me that's telling me he reigns how can you go through their trials in peace and joy because there's something down inside of me that tells me he's all faithful Hallelujah it's a relationship can you say man yet mortal beings will never comprehend it can't Isaiah 55 9 God says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts now that's god making that statement how true it is so how could he have fellowship with the people that can't even understand him how how can he have fellowship with the people amen that that don't even comprehend who he is amen but he decides Amen to clean this whole body out amen that he himself could live in us and Quicken our thoughts Quicken our thinking amen now we can sing the songs Oh How Great Thou Art amen we can look at the trees and see God we can look at the flower and see God we can look it all around us and see God it's everywhere can you say man amen I can see God in you because I can identify his characteristics of who he is can you say man you should have been out and gone long time ago but there's a power that's holding you glory Lord so what God is and what he does is completely beyond the the comprehension of man job said of the Lord he doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders without number Paul wrote in Romans 11 33 saying oh the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out in Isaiah 40 and 25 God asked to whom then will you liken me or shall I be equal saith the Holy One Oh my he asked again in Isaiah 46 5 to whom will you liking me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like now you think of it because of man's lack of comprehension of God they think they can be equal to God because of their lack of knowledge of who he really is they're trying to be God themselves or ain't that right they're exalting himself but if you ever come into the presence of God and you understand who he is it'll melt you it it makes you humble it makes you bow before him oh how arrogant people can get in this day when the presence of God comes and they just fold their arms and they look and they call it a devil oh my God has come down in this age to a prophet the angel of the Lord came night after night after night and the people that set their stonehearted amen but there was an elect that says that's God Amen that's that that's the one I serve I can see his realities so we find that in the ninth verse of Isaiah 46 God said Remember the formal things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me and we say Amen amen we ain't trying to find someone equal to him amen we are not putting ourselves as equal with him he's God and I'm so glad that we have that comprehension amen that we're able to comprehend that there's nobody like our Lord amen I'm not going to serve the Pope I ain't going to serve some other Prophet that has come I'm not going to serve anything else I serve my God and him alone for I can comprehend his attributes now the prophet or the he says here I am God there's none like me declaring the end from the beginning keep that in mind declaring the end from the beginning from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure ain't that right now God could not be Supernatural if he was not omniscient or omnipotent amen omnipotent and this word omnipotent means having unlimited Authority influence a force of unlimited power how many believes God's omnipotent amen he could not be Supernatural if he wasn't omnipotent amen but when he speaks it's omnipotent speaking amen and that is with unlimited Authority influence or a force of unlimited power amen so of course this word is in reference Amen to the the power of almighty God Amen there's none else that is omnipotent amen God is omnipotent amen and so to show that he is omnipotent then he shows or he performs the supernatural amen God is Not Just Like Us that that just that works within the realm of humanity but he's omnipotent amen and God wants us to know that he's omnipotent so he performs the supernatural now now you you got to know the contrast the laws of God Amen you would not know appreciate the day if there had not been for the night you're not appreciate the the the warm if it had not been freezing cold you'd now appreciate amen see there's that law of contrast so this is why God would choose us and make us what we are he made you full of weaknesses he made you full of failure he'll put your back against the wall to where you ain't got no way out amen and then he comes as the omnipotent one amen and performs the Supernatural and then we raise our hands unto him and say God I thank you amen because there's no one else like you that's why we can sing the song There's No One There's No One Like Jesus amen there's no one like him I've looked I searched I've a world over and I found there's no one like him why because it took you amen getting in your weak your Dark Hour your your time to where you can't do nothing about it and God steps in and performs the supernatural ain't that right see so so you see a man cannot know God without knowing a man that he is omnipotent brother Brown said it always takes the miraculous to speak of the omnipotence of God aren't you glad for that so I thank God for the miraculous I know we cry and then we think you know and all these but I think the more mature we get in God Amen we come to understand that when we Face the trials that we just automatically know God's going to bring us out God's going to bring us out if he done it yesterday he can do it today if you've done it a year ago I mean I mean you you think either go down your path you shouldn't be here but God kept you amen the times that you wanted to give up you're still here there's an omnipotent power amen there's an omnipotent God that has taken over your vessel it's true and can I say it this way there's nothing you can do to kick him out for the Bible said you're sealed to the day of your Redemption your Humanity ain't big enough to kick him out your failures ain't big enough to kick him out ah yes sir it's true now your weaknesses and your inabilities and all the things about you amen and your troubles and and now now the church we give God trouble A lot of times amen there's times that we he wants to go this way and we get so confused in our mind we don't know which way and and he has to break us he has to mold us he has to shape us to finally we see the direction but he never left us [Applause] it's omnipotence it always takes the miraculous the prophet said to speak of the omnipotence of God brother Rams says omnipotence is the all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and only the miraculous can do it teaching of the word is very is a very fine thing and it come faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but it always everybody say it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotent still lives and Reigns oh God now you know I I think of that because Balaam remember we talk about Balaam of how he looked at Israel and he criticized Israel he saw all their hinder Parts he saw and and and he looked at them by from a moral standpoint and then he says how in the world could a God Like That amen a holy God look upon a people like that and have anything to do with him how could he honor them how could he you understand what I'm saying how could he live among them there ain't no way so he decides to curse him and every time he opened his stinking mouth to curse them God would bless them God just blessed them and you know what them prophecies are still coming to pass that's right but you know what it pleased God to live within people because it was through them people he would show his miraculous power and prove that he's still omnipotent so brother Brown said it always takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnit that the omnipotent still lives and Reigns and then he says we must we must have the miraculous we must now according to Webster this word miraculous means performed supernaturally I do not work miraculous you do not work miraculous the pope does not work miraculous Trump did not work miraculous Biden sure ain't doing it and no other one is going to do it you understand that miraculous is performed by the supernatural or by a power beyond the ordinary agency of natural laws affected by the direct agency of Almighty power and not by natural causes can you say Amen amen we're thankful for what we have in the natural amen but that's not miraculous medicine does not work the miraculous only God can work the miraculous ain't that right amen but when you get God work in the miraculous things change things are transformed the situations that you're up against amen all of a sudden disappears that's the miraculous and you can't explain it by human ability but if you can comprehend that it's God working for you he's working he's at work God can take the worst vile Sinner and transform him into a son of God you know what that's why we believe that no matter how Wayward our boy girl gets I don't care how wavered and then Prophet said no matter how wayward they can they'll still be saved I just believe in that now the prophet said if you believe it have enough faith for yourself then you believe for them that's right so it's the supernatural now we're looking at the miraculous God see he can take the worst case scenario and change the situation in a moment's time the worst case scenario he can take the worst diseased infested body and make it completely whole to where there is no sign that it ever occurred amen I'm thinking of the story of the young lady that uh raised in church I think I believe she was raised in church and but she didn't have an experience with God Satan got a hold of her mind tormenting her and she started cutting herself and cut her arms and wherever but she cut herself she bore scars of all the cuts you just sit there and cut I I you know no human mind no human individual in the right mind would do that junk that's the devil doing that right but then God got hold of that lady Supernatural look like a situation that was impossible but God worked the supernatural the miraculous to prove that he was still omnipotent he saved that girl delivered her filled her with the Holy Ghost and now here she is trying to serve God with all them scars she felt so ugly felt just so rejected it just it just you know it messed with her mind and and and and to see all these scars of her past and it came to her God if you could save my soul and you could deliver me I'm asking you now just to take these scars away and the omnipotent came in and worked the miraculous and every one of them scars are gone not even a remembrance of what she was or what she did see God it takes the miraculous to prove that the omnipotent God still lives and Reigns can you say Amen now these testimonies that we see like these things gives us encouragement a man that we could go to the darkest hours and still lift up holy hands without wrath or doubting knowing that it's going to be taken care of you're walking in his will you're walking according to what he wants you to walk amen there is nothing that the devil can do to hurt you and you say well even if you're in Disobedience look look what Abraham and God done with Abraham and kept Sarah amen and that King from touching Sarah amen and said if you touch Sarah you're going to destroy a nation that I promise would come through her and you ain't gonna do that I'll kill you right now amen and here Abraham was alive he was disobedient he was out of the will of God Amen and yet he never lost the Covenant it was omnipotent God watching over him I hope that's all right but it's true so all through the Bible God performed the miraculous which is something that cannot be explained but yet it's true and it starts the super the the miraculous the supernatural starts in Genesis 1 1. in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth amen I that's incredible and and we know what create means it means to bring into existence so God brought the heavens and earth into existence he brought light into existence he he brought the universe into existence amen he brought the dirt amen that we live as a walk on into existence he he brought the trees the flowers the the grass into existence he brought man into existence ain't that right see at one time it didn't exist and now it does exist it took the miraculous Amen to do that he he had nothing to take from and to make amen now we will do that amen we we will we will take these elements and make rubber amen then from that rubber we'll make a tire we'll make we'll make something we'll do this we'll take iron and and and we'll we'll mold it and and we'll make it and and we call that inventions or or or or what whatever amen but we can never have the power in ourselves to bring into existence even the devil has no power to bring into existence he has to have something to work through but here's a God Amen that was before all things and yet he would he would bring all these things into existence ain't that right he created everything he brought he brought the oxygen into existence there was nowhere there was no oxygen he brought the atoms into existence he brought the molecules into existence oh God and that God that done that is now living in a body praise the Lord praise the Lord see it's something that he could only do by his Supernatural power Colossians 1 16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things everybody say all things were created by Him by him and for him amen nothing out of place the whole thing by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist ain't that right so it's God performing the supernatural amen now how did he do this how how did he bring this into existence how how was this he spoke the creative word ain't that right now we're dealing with God now because you want to know what part what body you are but belong to amen what you are to reflect amen seek God before he had a body before he had you to live in amen he was there all by himself amen and and and we we know how the prophet says it that that a light came from God which was the pillar fire the anointed logos the amen uh the anointing and he called it the Christ ain't that right amen and then God lived in that Pillar of Fire right there amen and then he spoke Let There Be and when he spoke see then the logos that anointed that that the the Christ the the the the pillar of fire began to brood over the Earth amen God's Own anointing God's own life begin to brood over the earth and the prophet said up came azaleas and up came bushes and up came trees and up came this and up came that at the word of God right amen see what was it God was able to bring his own word to pass amen what he spoke he was able by the miraculous by the supernatural by what he is he needed nothing else he could bring his own word to reality ain't that right so you will only see God in his word that's right Amen brother Brown said God's word is God's life and God's power ain't that right so uh Psalms 107 20 he sent his word and healed them the word went before amen he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction so his word heals his word delivers his word sets free his word saves his word transforms ain't that right brother Brown said I don't know hardly what to what more to do than first to bring you this word God's word and then after that has been brought then God's spirit comes down to confirm that word signs and wonders and so forth telling the people everything just exactly the way Supernatural Spirit beings do ain't that right see so he he says here just uh he says the supernatural everybody say the Supernatural is always with the word the Supernatural is always with the word not with not with the some denomination not with some name over the church he's with the word that's why the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always it's the word he says any any faith that anybody wants to have in the Supernatural it must place be placed first in the word of the Living God Amen ain't that right that's why we don't believe blood coming out of hands and we don't it's not in the word amen we don't believe in all these things I you know uh uh back in in the the reservation in in Arizona you know uh they got to work in performing the Witchcraft in the church and and and pyota whatever they do on that trap but they got to work in it in the church uh the pastor was a uh Indian guy and he got what whatever and and he he uh actually raised uh uh they said he he raised a man sitting on the uh laying on the on the floor there and he raised him off of the in the air just sitting there raising and and and he was trying to show that that he can do performing he could perform things and that he was a powerful thing and everybody needed to listen to him amen but see that's contrary to the word of God are you with me that's contrary to the word of God yes sir that's why it takes the Holy Spirit to be able to comprehend God and know how he works and he only works through his word is that right so if God's word prophesies the prophet said if he if God's word prophesies something and God takes the Supernatural and proves that it's the truth it's the urum summon people time to receive it and believe God God always manifests himself in Supernatural but always everybody say always according to his word for he is Supernatural we're talking about the being that lives in you he is Supernatural so then be careful of anything that's outside of the word of God I don't care what they produce I don't care what anointing they produce I don't care what goes on Amen and you say well I've never seen that done before it does not matter if it's not according to the word leave it alone you say well I can't even do them things amen well you're not meant to be you only can work the supernatural in the word now the word of God is quick and Powerful that's what the Bible says and Jesus was the word he is the word ain't that right notice he raised the Dead because that's what the word said he would do calls the blind to see the lame to walk cast out Devils he set free those who were bound because the word said he would do it and the supernatural always is in the word ain't that right now brother Brown said when you receive the word you received Jesus for he is the word believe we believe that Christ is God's word made manifest and we believe that his bride must be the same thing oh I hope you hope you understand where I'm where I'm coming from the word makes the difference God done it by his word the word went forth in the Supernatural follows ain't that right we're not just those Supernatural following uh working in us the word must be in the bride she must be the same thing ain't that right remember Jonathan Chambers done Miracles just like Moses but Moses had the word he was working the supernatural based off the word there was a message come with that Supernatural so he says we believe that she must believe every bit of the word and have that word in her because she is part of the body she is the body where he is the head ain't that right so what you have in you is the word living in you you're the body of the word so when God said something says something then watch the supernatural happen and bring the word of God to pass this is why God this is why the word of God can be very detailed and specific and it's foretelling because every word of God will come to pass no guessing now I'm going to talk to you for just a moment I'll let you go in Noah's day God foretold of rain coming 120 years before it happened and it had never happened before but yet God told Noah that it would happen and Noah was so convinced that he never used the words now y'all better be ready just in case something happens hello he didn't leave it in general because he's talking to Mortal beings that always something going to happen but God was specific and he told Noah you tell them specifically what's going to happen it's going to rain yes it become a laughing stop Noah became a laughing stock of it because they proved that there was no rain up there they proved that there were and they would ask for proof and Noah had no proof but God said so [Music] but that's all the proof he needed and that's all the proof that the elect needed can you say amen and God took 120 years to fulfill it but it happened then you say Amen what happened the supernatural took place he foretold of Israel God foretold of Israel being in bondage in Egypt uh years before it happened and and how that they would be delivered and go into the land that he had gave them and it happened just that way ain't that right he foretold of the Messiah coming to Earth and what he would be and do and it happened just that way now Jesus there in Matthew 24 35 Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away ain't that right shall not pass away again Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so the spirit gives life to the word the prophet said ain't that right so that's why you not only have the word but you have the spirit working in you the word living inside of you pull Satan inside of you so man's word will fail but the supernatural will never fail ain't that right and man's word fails because the supernatural's not there to back it up God only backs up his own word can you say that with me God only backs up his own word story Romans 3 4 says let God be true but every man a liar ain't that right so now when man speaks man cannot predict the future and be accurate in his prediction because he has no power to make his prediction come to pass ain't that right we have our weather Prophets and they'll give us the weather plan and all these things and then it don't happen but we just say well you know we could get upset and say well I thought they said it was going to be sunny now I hear it's raining all that and stuff but we already know that they ain't gods they they can't work the supernatural they're understanding their future prediction is leaning upon scientific knowledge but when God said something it's going to happen just that way ain't that right so God can forekel something to happen and it'll come to pass because the word is coming from the supernatural then if that be the case then God can be so precise and what he says and give us the specific details about it example the Lord showed brother Branham you know that a boy would raise from the dead after being hit by a car ain't that right now he didn't just say a boy going to be hit by a car well if I can sit this way duh if he'd say that I mean how many boys that day were going to be hit by a car worldwide but then he begins to gives the specific details he's gonna be brown haired he'll be brown eyed he'll be about eight years old he describes how awful it was but then he looks and says it's going to be in a rocky land there'll be mountains there'll be rocks all around it and he began to describe the details of this event and then he begins to tell the around the world two years before it happens now he forgot about it he tells him how he walked upon the scene looks at and says oh my that's a hopeless case that is so bad and getting ready to turn away and something grips his heart and he turns around and looks at that boy looks around the landscape and says I've seen this before right and he tells the brother that was with him says go get your Bible he come and got his Bible says Now read that Vision that I told you about and he began to read and there it all was it was all described he said now stop it from happening he said there was no devil to stop that boy from Raising from the dead because it had already been prophesied God had given the details already there and that boy raised from the dead and remember the mama of the other boy said well if you can do that then do this one he says I can't do it I don't know he said she said well will my boy live he says I don't know God showed me that boy of course he went and prayed for the boy and the boy live but as far as for the vision he didn't have none but what I'm saying is God can be specific when he speaks it's specific oh do you love him see so God is not limited time and he's not bound by circumstances therefore he can foretell of something to happen to the exact place the exact time way before it happens you realize God spoke through the prophet Nahum in the Old Testament telling of our cars and our highways like that Ryan he didn't just say way I say to you that something's going to be out there I see something I just don't know what it you know but something's happening he told us exactly what it would be I also believe that God told of our media coverage too in our our technology that we have you look at Revelations 8 and 8 for tells of the two prophets that would be killed in Jerusalem and their dead bodies shall lie on the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified and they of the people in kindreds and tongues and Nations shall see their dead body how's that going to happen now we know how it will happen he'll be all over the media can you say Amen God knows what's going to happen and he can tell exactly what would be and probably when it was written when John wrote this in the Book of Revelation they're thinking how in the world can that happen it takes us months just to get from one country to another country by ship but see he foretells that the whole world would see the event take place and this was foretold nearly 2 000 years before internet and television and all that took place can you say Amen God foretold of the destruction of of Jerusalem and and and and there in Ezekiel 9 I'm not going to read it for the sake of time that Ezekiel 9 and 3 through 7. he foretelled foretells of the destruction of of Jerusalem and foretold it 900 years before it ever happened ain't that right and then Here Comes Jesus Amen in his day forewarning his disciples of this same event Matthew in Matthew 24 15 through 18 and and tell them when you therefore uh uh shall see uh the abomination of desolation spoken of by uh Daniel the Prophet and stand in the Holy place whosoever readeth let him understand then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes ain't that right this was fulfilled in 80 70 through Titus ain't that right brother Brown said Titus brought this great Army of Romans and Greeks and compassed the walls of Jerusalem pinned those people in there now they starve to death they barked from the trees Josephus the great historian tells us see they ate grass off the ground they even bowled one another's children and eat it as as they were mad people see then when finally Titus he was setting back upon the heels around Jerusalem and saw those people in there and thought they were doing the see those people thought they were doing the will of God when they saw these armies Marching In they had refused to hear the great Master Lord Jesus tell them that but notice he says there wasn't one of them Christians caught in there for they saw the sign and moved aren't you glad that God is specific in what he does he made sure to let them know the details ain't that right so they won't be confused and said I wonder if this is the vent or something else is going to happen they knew exactly when it was going to happen and not one Christian not one believer that stood with the message of the hour was caught in there yes sir to see they said he said let them that's on the housetop not come down or him that's in the field go back not take his coat but flee into Judea see pray that your flat not be in the winter time or on the Sabbath because in the winter time the heels would be full of snow and on the Sabbath day the doors would be closed the gate see and they'd be caught in that condition see so so we find now I've read this I'll read it again Isaiah 46-9 remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else see that's the body that you are of is the god that there is none else amen I am God and there's none like me declaring the end from the beginning from the ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure I say to you that's the way of God I hope it's okay when the word of the Lord came to the prophets they were specific in every detail that even when the prophet spoke they didn't even understand it they even wondered how it would be their human comprehension how could these things happen and yet it happened and they would speak the word of the Lord in detail and then they would go by the way of the grave but yet that word that came out of their mouth was settled forever ain't that right so example Isaiah prophesied Behold a virgin shall conceive he didn't Now Behold a woman shall conceive he was specific detailed a virgin will conceive now that that throws the question out there how in the world could a virgin conceive it wasn't Isaiah's words it was Supernatural God that took the lips of that man and began to speak it used his vocal cords and began to speak to a people amen and prophesy that there's coming a time that the impossibility will happen and I'll be the omnipotent one that makes it happen ain't that right yes sir a virgin shall conceive you know today we've had in the Pentecostal movement you know a lot of prophecies a lot of gifts a lot of speaking and tongues interpretation and tongues and and you find you know when I say you can but you know when when man prophesies he just tells us what we already know and he you know he'll tell us well the Lord's coming be quick you know make yourself ready yeah I say make yourself ready well that's all fine and good but we didn't need a prophecy for that if you read your Bible you know the Lord said he's coming it's our pretty specific about the details as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of Noah as they were given in marriage and drinking and you marrying and giving in marriage you understand you you know the Scriptures it was detailed to where you could look and say this is the age the Lord is coming ain't that right I've seen him look out in the audience and maybe you have two look out across the audience of a thousand people and say well um the Lord shows me there's someone here that's got a heart condition not to say anything wrong I could do that I could do it this morning so oh somebody's got some problems foreign and I ain't trying to be funny I'm just trying to tell you truth and if you're gullible enough you say boy he hit me this morning the Lord spoke to me so we find but God man has to be vague because he starts telling my new details about people's lives he gonna miss it but God don't have to be vague God don't have to leave it out in general and we've seen it Time After Time After Time in this age and not one of them failed to be wrong then you say Amen why because God has an infinite mind and he knows the end from the beginning ain't that right he could tell you what you've done 30 years ago he could tell you what happened you may be a hundred years old he could tell you what happened at Birth sure ain't that right he could tell everything about it now the prophet says here he says see uh uh uh many of you strangers perhaps hear these men get up and make these remarks about a message of this hour and so forth what they are getting at is God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do see and we see him scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do in the same manner now God didn't just take one scripture and prophesy of this age you can take scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture both Old and New Testament of what God promised for this age and not one scripture will fail malachia has been fulfilled do you believe that Luke 17 30 is fulfilled Revelations is fulfilled Ephesians is scriptures about Ephesians amen of what God promised in this day is being fulfilled it's true so we find see he says see uh uh uh we see him scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do in the same manner foretold his just exactly perfectly each time because it's God saying it now if a man I don't care who he is will try to make such a prediction there's one chance out of 10 million one chance if a man told you a certain thing would happen and it would happen at a certain time one out of 10 million and then the place it would happen would be about one chance out of a hundred million and then the time it would happen and goes on and on and on the way it will happen and what will be happening and so forth and see it's just beyond a guess when we see it so perfectly each and every time then we know it's of God now I'm going to tell you if God can take a seventh grade educated uh Kentuckian that didn't hardly know anything about anything you understand what I'm saying amen I'm not putting him down but I believe God done that for a reason to show his miraculous in uh omnipotent power working through an individual he didn't take some educated man he took a dumb uh uh uh a poor uh Kentuckian amen and revealed his miraculous works and if God could take that man and and prophesy and tell it and it would happen just exactly the way it happened why can't he do us the same way I don't think we ought to use our gifts and guess is okay I like the story of the time the woman went up in prayer line brother Brown told her address you live on such and such street brother Perry green says that that woman come down and happened to sit right in front of him and her friend looked over there and told her and he heard it he says she she told that lady says but you don't live on that you don't live on that address your address is so and so and the lady says oh I forgot to tell you I just moved yesterday see God keeps up with it God keeps up with it here God just changed Abraham and Sarah's name from Abram and Sarah to Abraham and Sarah and when God showed up in Melchizedek he didn't call her Sarai he said where is Sarah thy wife he knew exactly because he's the one that changed it and now he's standing in a human body looking right at Abraham and Discerning and being specific with what just happened no guesswork now God places nine nine spiritual gifts in his church you believe that two of them is Gifts of tongues and the gift of interpretation of tongues and they are not meant to be used by man they are meant to be used of God do you believe that they are not to exalt a man they are used to exalt gold and to edify the Church of the Living God they are used to show that God is still alive and that he's still omnipotent that when the when it's done and when it's said and when it happens we can all say God's been with us today that God has spoken directly to us can you say Amen now so God put them in the church for when he has something to say so then they are you to be used in a supernatural way ain't that right now this is just for my church okay for us speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues must not be you know brother Brian said just the quoting of scripture because God doesn't use vain repetition it must be everybody say it must be a direct message to the church he says it couldn't be now like Jesus is coming soon well we know that and other things that the scriptures declared it would be something like this tell thus saith the Lord tell tell brother Jones to get away from that place where he lives for it's near a railroad track and for tomorrow at two o'clock there's going to be a wreck there and his house will be destroyed what that's something specific that's a direct message ain't that right or tell brother Branham that tonight there will be somebody in from a certain place that's got a certain disease be dressed a certain way and he shall go to them they'll be brought in tonight by ambulance and tell them that this thing that's against them it's thus saith Lord specific another place the first thing you know when the message is over the healing line Starts Here Comes the woman a woman someone spoke in tongues and she said she was and said she was coming every one of us knows what's going to happen every one of us knows it see see how the faith begins to build with them tongues of fire standing over you now she's she's began to accumulate together why it's just a finished work that's all see that woman he said I'll say you know Miss so-and-so from New York setting here oh that's right well how did you know that it's a message from the Lord to the church when you were 16 years old wasn't you at a certain certain place and done take some money from the church and stole it and went out and got new clothes with it oh that's right that is right see that's exactly what God has told us tonight through brother so and so spoke with tongues see brother so and so interpreted brother so and so here of the discernment said it was from the Lord and that's the truth yes then thus said the Lord go make it right and you'll get over your cancer see it's a specific message [Music] brother Jones goes home gets the wagons backs up gets his furniture gets away from there two o'clock tomorrow afternoon brother Brown makes a sound illustrate and goals the whole thing off see then the church glorifies thank you Lord Jesus for your goodness now see that's what that's what it is to edify for the church now if it doesn't happen after they've said it then you've got an evil spirit among you and you don't want that evil thing why do you want something evil when the skies are full of Pentecostal real can you say Amen see what is it it's God the supernatural God working through his body hope you understand nope God doesn't change because he comes inside of you he's still infinite so when he really speaks to a man when he speaks to a boy girl whatever it would be he can be very detailed and specific why not to glorify that man and actually brother Branham says that a man can prophesy one time and the Lord never use him again to prophesy foreign see so there's nothing vague when it comes to the prophecies concerning this day God foretold of it just about every scripture in the Bible he foretold us that God would send a prophet ain't that right to us and that Prophet would have the spirit of Elijah upon him which is the Holy Ghost God foretold that his ministry would be that of Melchizedek he foretold that he would get the bride just as Eliezer got a bride for Isaac you see all these types in the Bible were speaking of something to come now we can see through the ministry of brother Branham and we can compare the ministry with them types and then prophes to say it's been fulfilled ain't that right now it rests our soul to where we don't have to look for another it's happened oh do you love him Oh My My My I love him see so when it came time for these scriptures to be fulfilled there was nothing vague about it churches denied it preachers denied it Pope denied it everybody denied it but that little elect saw the scriptures that begin to compare it with scripture to scripture the ministry scripture actions with scripture miraculous with scripture everything typed it everything mass and then we can say he's the one oh the Lord is good I still believe God's moving in the bride today I still believe that the miraculous is working speaking of an omnipotent God the supernatural can you say man got more to go but if the musicians will come brother Brown said many of you strangers perhaps hear these men get up make remarks he said see you're talking about the the the one out of chance which I've read a lot of these things he says see he says it's just beyond the guess when we see it so perfectly each and every time then it's God then we turn right back in the Scriptures it may seem foreign to us but we turn right back in the scriptures without even knowing where to look think of that we don't even know where to look and the Holy Spirit brings out and just puts the whole word together makes the picture there to show us just the hour that we're living aren't you glad for the supernatural God it's a miracle it's the miraculous that you believe in this message it's the miraculous that you can see the message in the Bible how else would we know where to look except he quickened it to us oh may God bless you this morning you love him I honestly believe that if you look in the scriptures there's nothing vague about the prophecies concerning the bride [Music] oh my God could so Quicken it to us we could look and see if we're part of this we could see it working we can see it moving see what part we have to play in this age amen so wonderful can you say man amen it's and and and it's so clear it's so pacifically detailed brother branham's Ministry was so detailed and and and clear in the prophecies that it would take a blind man a man would have to be blind and the prophecies concerning the bride is so clear in detail that it would take a man I'd have to be blind not to see it but I'm so glad God has given us the Isaac to open our eyes Hallelujah you love him amen what song are we singing no one else can touch my heart like you do I can search for
