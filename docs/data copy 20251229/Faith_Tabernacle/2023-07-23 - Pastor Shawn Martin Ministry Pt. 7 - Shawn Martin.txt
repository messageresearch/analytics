a risen savior amen and the musicians can be dismissed praise the Lord and I didn't say it Wednesday night but we're really glad to have Brother Sam I know he was fighting sickness and last weekend and sister Bonnie and and so we're glad that they're doing better a man and uh glad to have the boys back he took a trip to Oklahoma Thursday Daniel and Judah and brother Junior and so they made it in at 10 o'clock this morning so but we appreciate them and glad the Lord kept them on the road brought them back safely and um also we want to remember communion tonight as well and uh just believe the Lord to to be with us and um brother Amos was telling me before service that he got a minister last night to at a mission kind of is that is that what it was a mission there in Roanoke and oh Glenn Lynn uh so uh but just had a wonderful time a wonderful Liberty and introduced the message to them us so we thank the Lord for that and just pray that the Lord just keep that door open and uh the Lord just use him in a mighty way amen and I think that's what it's about is just trying to reach uh the that last soul that last seed amen and um so uh but also just to let you know we're not going to be we'll be dismissing uh Sunday night service next Sunday and for the young people young couples uh like to have a question and answer at night and uh maybe we'll just do it at the house maybe outside around the bond a fire or so and so if you have any questions that you you you have and we could talk about them and and just go from there and I think it'd be just a good time amen so no no Sunday night service next Sunday and here and so also tonight I would like for you to um very you that that would want to bring bring a notebook and I got I'm going to go through a lot of scriptures tonight about the Oneness of god of what we believe and um and uh not going to really just teach on it as much as just give scriptures go through the Bible and give scriptures and you write them down and I think it'd be good for you young people to write them down and and something I was telling uh uh well I believe I've told my children but it's telling uh Faith the other day that a lot a lot of times I'll start with a a uh a scripture I'll just start an opening scripture that I'm familiar with and then um I'll take another scripture and I'll write down where where it's found by that one scripture and uh that way if I'm talking to someone about scriptures then then I'll go to that one scripture main scripture and by that it it tells me where to go next and then I take it and I'll go to that scripture and then I'll write another scripture down and and it takes it all the way through the Bible and um and because people want to know what we believe and what we do believe is in the Bible I I couldn't point you to a Creed or a Dogma or a denomination but we can point you to the Bible of what we believe and so um I I think it'd be good uh to go through these things and and um and and sometime we take it for granted that everybody knows and uh which which you know you young people should know what we believe but you need to know why you believe it and um understand you know as to why so sometimes uh we we forget maybe just to go back to foundational uh Doctrine beliefs or whatever but and so but but the Bible does say uh study to show thyself approved and uh that rightly dividing the word of Truth and and of course the other scripture that tells us that every man ought to be able to give an answer to the hope that lies within and so our answer should be a scriptural answer ain't that right and so anyways uh we we're going to do that and and um so so uh what I'm going to do is um instead of me just reading them I'm going to have each of you to read them read scriptures and someone get uh if uh these boys are going to be here tonight going to get Levi and David to take a microphone uh uh to you all and that way uh we we can hear you when you're reading and then we can write them down and uh I I think it would be a good time so anyways Hosea the 12th chapter um and of course I didn't ask these boys but I just figured they'd want to so amen Hosea the 12th chapter and the 10th verse says I have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets let me read that again I have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer father it is truly good to be in your house among Believers Lord and as we have dedicated this building many many years ago from those that have established this place to be a worship place of worship father we believe that you honor their prayers and their efforts and their labors Father Here We Stand today a new generation of new people Lord standing in this building and you have done many many things throughout the years in this place but Lord we're asking that you would do it again today father that you would speak through mortal lips Lord and help me to get myself out of the way and Lord that you would come and move among the people and father just give us the words to say and Lord let it be planted in every heart and you alone know the needs Lord and and what needs to be said and we pray that you would now take over and have the preeminence in this service in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this evening or morning and this is of course I'm going to speak on ministry again and and uh it's a broad subject and so I I know that of course the Eternal Word is is always a broad subject on anything and so I I know I won't be able to cover it all and and dare not try uh uh but uh Ministry is is important because I I think that's where we find Our Place and and position is with when we when we do find our place in position we we realize that we're part of ministry and uh now I don't mean to be Elementary uh but I I do want to make it as simple as I know how so that everyone can get the idea of ministry and and we understand that no matter how simple you make it it takes God to to reveal it and uh but but we we certainly don't want to preach in mystery form and uh we we've called to preach the gospel and and and so I want to make it as clear as I can brother Branham said no matter how simple the gospel is if Christ is in it it'll draw people and uh so we we have talked about the purpose of God and um in the beginning again we talk about it that God dwelt Alone with his thoughts and and at that time he wasn't even God uh for God is an object of worship and so there was nothing there to worship him for he was God he or he dwelt alone and so we'd call him Elohim the self-existent one and uh he was the Eternal uh being and and uh and within him were attributes his attributes and his attributes the prophet would tell us were his thoughts and then then uh his thoughts became expressed into word for uh a word is an expression of thought it has to be a thought and then expressed into word and and so these attributes or thoughts of God uh the prophet would tell us that they're Eternal because God is eternal and anything a part of God is eternal and they are real they're real so as he would say that if you're you were in God's thinking if you were in God's thinking then you will always uh be there uh see if if he says if you've got eternal life then you are an expression or the attribute of his thought for this age as as we know that God allotted his word for each age each time segment and and within that time segment then there were thoughts of God that that were for that age and and there were people in that age that were the thoughts of God that God ordained them for that age to manifest himself or his word and so we're living in an age is the laodicean age it's it's the end of the ages it's the end of time it's the end of everything we're in the finale and so God had thoughts about this age and and he allotted his word and and it would be the completion of his vision for a bride and for a church and it would be a mighty Church it would be a dynamic church and all of these things things well then there were people that were in his thinking that he says they're going to be in this age and they're going to be part of this and and and so I believe that uh I'm a part of that I I'm not an accident uh that that just happened and I'm not just coasting alone I'm not by here by coincidence I was the Eternal thought of God and so uh uh therefore in God's mind you existed if you were in God's thoughts before the foundation world you existed in his mind before the foundation of the world and so God knew all about you knew about your life your character your nature he designed you to be what you are today and so it isn't what you think about yourself it isn't what somebody else thinks about you it's what God thinks about you that's that's the only thing that's Eternal and that's the only thing that's real amen is what God thinks about you and and so um yeah it was in God to be man uh uh and that's the reason Christ was the expressed image of God uh there and it was not just God to be man but it was in God to be father it was in God to be son it was in God attributes to be savior to be healer to be a family it was all in God and and and then in God's thoughts was a church and this church uh in God's mind would be without spot wrinkle or blemish it would be a powerful Church it would be a a super Church a super race it would be something that man could not uh uh imitate or anything like that and and so that it was all in God's thoughts and and then his thoughts become manifested ain't that right then they become the manifested uh manifestation of his thoughts then the prophet asked the thing of it is am I there or are you there amen that's the question right and that's what he puts before the church is are you there am I in there well then it in one place he said you Christians you Christians how many Christians do we have well then you Christians were in his thoughts uh before there was a world so you were his thoughts a Believer a genuine believer were his thoughts before the foundation of the world and and and not just just as a church member not just as a religious person but you were in his thoughts as Sons and Daughters of his sons and daughters of God and that's the way God's always thought you to be was sons and daughters and he wrote your name in that Lamb's Book of Life and every name in that book is is Redemptive it's it's it can be redeemed it's redeemable ain't that right amen a lot of religions people but they're not redeemable but them thoughts that were in the mind of God are redeemable amen and and that's what makes up the Church of the Living God that's what makes up the bride that's those that are going in the Rapture ain't that right and so we we find that these thoughts that God uh had in his mind they were Sons and Daughters God called them already he he predestinated them already he he justified them and he glorified them as we've talked about amen there there is no way that you can change that no man can change that no sin can change that the devil can't change that nothing can change it it's already put because they were it's that what that's the Eternal thought of God ain't that right amen that's the Eternal thought of God so God has already declared the end from the beginning ain't that right and so he's not doing everything by chance uh uh uh and and and so we we look and Jeremiah 29 11 we read it before but God says I know the thoughts that I think toward you why they were his thoughts amen not your thoughts his thoughts amen he's very acquainted with his thoughts so I know the thoughts that I have uh think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end ain't that right so now God made man a free moral agent amen uh so that he could make his own choices man is capable of loving of Desiring he has passions he's capable of of hearing two different reports two different things or more than than two and and he's able to choose between them two reports amen that's just the way God made him and and we we've talked about it uh uh these last services but uh we were all sold into sin because of Adam's transgression against the word of God but that never changed God's thoughts toward us ain't that right and and we talked about it brother Brown's told us that there's a permissive will of God and there's the perfect will of God well I will tell you the perfect will of God are the Eternal thoughts of God Amen what God allowed is what God permitted amen but he always makes it work out to his perfect will sin was not the perfect will of God it was the permissive will of God and and and we've gone our lives have been to the permissive will of God we were born in sin but yet we were sons of God in his mind we we we we uh we we might have been druggies we might have been alcoholics and we might have been prostitutes and we might have been evens just sitting in a religious form but that was the permissive will of God but but God's perfect will he never forgot them thoughts amen and that was to you to be a son and daughter of God Amen and to be an ex in the express image the be the manifestation of them thoughts same thing that ride so that's what you being a Christian is God never saved you filled you with the Holy Ghost just to go the trend of the world Amen there's many people setting religious claiming God and all that and and there's no power in their lives there's no Authority in their lives there's nothing a man and and all they're doing is expressing a theology they're expressing their denomination they're expressing amen some belief of man and some idea of man or of their own but then God would take a people a man that that were Eternal in his thoughts amen and he says I've come in this age to take you out of all of that to set you free that you could come back and manifest what I thought about you and I promise you God's thoughts about you isn't to be weak Church weak Beverly people be disoriented and not know what you believe and all confused and all messed up and all these things he's called you to be a powerful Church be powerful ain't that right and so so God knows God knows the thoughts that he has towards us and they are Eternal and they are real and and and that's why you cannot look at what you are today you you can't amen and and the message of the hour did not come to deal with you according to what you are in your first birth that come to deal with you according to the thoughts of God Amen that's right see so now when Adam sinned uh he hid himself and and it would seem uh that Adam would have run to God and and said man I've sinned I've done wrong please forgive me do something Amen to get me back but he didn't he ran from God and he hid and and uh uh but it was the father and father God a man that went through the garden seeking Adam Adam Adam where are you amen see because when he come down to meet was Adam that used to meet a man and commune together and fellowship together but somehow Adam missed the appointment you know uh he missed the appointment and and it was no longer uh uh uh a man coming to God he was hiding from God and the prophet says men always tried to justify themselves and he says man will try to hide behind someone instead of coming right out and saying what he is and confessing his sins before God he'll try to hide behind a stump amen see he tries to hide amen and he says the least sin the least of our sins should always be confessed no matter how it looks to you see it's sin in the sight of God ain't that right amen and and if we could understand that we'd be more careful how we act how we talk amen the directions we go and and and and the things we get involved in the things we look at that and the things we hear and all of these things not just any music uh is satisfactory to God Amen not just any life is right with God not just anything you hear and talk and about and listen to and and and watch and on all these things is is Godly and and no matter what it looks to you and me amen it's what God thinks about it ain't that right amen you see and so uh uh but but instead of coming to God and saying the old father forgive me I'm not wrong Adam come hiding amen and he hides you know and and of course he come up with his own religion ain't that right just like people today the prophet says coming up with their own religion they come up hiding and just worshiping under a religion of their own and don't think what God has to think about it amen see so it was God searching the father hunting his son and and the prophet put it this way God was grieving God was grieving for his Lost Boy amen and if we if you ever just think about it amen when the devil tries to tell you God doesn't love you think of what God has done amen and he done it by a grieving heart can you say man for God so loved the world John 3 16 he so loved the world a man that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have ever let eternal life everlasting life amen and the prophet would tell us Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life can you say amen I can say that again Jesus come not to redeem everybody because not everybody's redeemable not everybody was in his thinking it from the foundation of the world but he come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem and them as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there ain't that right now this is where the true Ministry uh uh of God comes in amen see the focus of the true gospel is getting those who were the thoughts of God in the beginning amen that's what God's wanting do you realize the Rapture cannot happen until the last Soul comes in and when the lasso comes in I don't care how many well we read it the other day of of it could take God could Terry his coming for ten thousand years and and when that last Soul comes in that's it no one no more no less will get saved you'll preach preach preach preach and there's nothing else that can be saved because only those that were redeemable in his thought thinking a man will be the ones that were are redeemed that's what the Rapture is for it's not for everybody it's not for every religious man it's not for everybody that proclaims Christianity it's for those that God forethought in his mind now so we're looking at the message of the hour do you realize this message is a message of redemption that's right it's the message of redemption and and and I I'll just say it tell you this and and and you can agree or not but it's the only thing that's got blood in it for it's the bloody bleeding word that's what the prophet said it's the bloody bleeding word and and and and and so we we look at it amen you say well what about the others that's going to be saved well they're going to be judged by their works ain't that right even the foolish virgin the prophet says that she she will go through the tribulation because she failed to accept the atonement in its fullness she rejected the atonement in its fullness can you say Amen so we we find that this is the gospel a man to the elect and the only gospel that will be effective on the predestinated seed of God Amen Billy Graham had his part but he was there for Sodom amen and and Oral Roberts had his part but he was there for the Pentecostals and and and did all these other things we understand their message amen but then there was a message that was given Amen to that elected Abraham ain't that right now we've identified that this message of this day that was given to a prophet of God is the message for the elect of God can you say amen amen and it's the only thing that will be effective on the predest donated seed ain't that right you see that this it's not just about getting people to then Altar and it's not about just getting them to a confession ain't that right but let's go on to this that that the gospel is about the ripening and the maturing of that predestinated seed do you believe that amen you you see you you say well well we're not getting a lot of people saved and a lot of people ain't coming in so we might be doing something wrong but but what we don't understand now now I am I am for getting people in I am for getting out and getting saved and we want people saved ain't that right but I ain't going to get them saved according to a Billy Graham message I'm not going to get them saved according to an Oral Roberts message I'm not going to get them saved to a bat according to a Baptist uh ideology of what salvation is there is a true salvation and that's the message of the hour amen now now you know uh uh because we found and the prophet said that Billy Graham was getting people to confession a man but he told them told us that they weren't really getting getting a true birth amen they were coming up yet confessing they were doing their little thing amen but see the Bible says that God the foundation of God stand ashore the Lord knoweth them that are his can you say amen and he sent a message in this hour to get those that are his ain't that right so but it's not just about going out and and and and and we we made it uh the World Church world has made it all about getting souls in souls and souls in you know brother Brown said they had that slogan I think it was the Baptist that had the slogan a million more and 44. you know and it's got to the point so so so so so amen that that they've left off the true word of God Amen because it offends too many people so we'll give them Donuts we'll give them bicycle giveaways we'll have a program we we get a professional choir we get professional preachers we get professional musicians we get it's almost like a concert anymore that you're coming to it's more just like a club it's it's something fantastic so we can draw Souls amen and and all their effort is in vain you understand what I'm saying that's right so we may not be seeing a lot of soul saved in in the sense of people coming off the streets coming in but still this message is doing something amen it's ripening it's maturing the predestinated sea do you believe that amen for that's what the prophet said amen that we're laying ripening in the pre in the presence of the son ain't that right amen yes sir so every day that you come to church and and you're playing them tapes and you're you're whatever you should be ripening you should be coming up in the full stature of Jesus Christ amen you should be getting away from the world it should be cutting things off to where you just don't want that anymore you don't desire that why yet it's a Ministry to bring you up into the full stature of Jesus Christ amen that's what this message is about there is no other message that can mature this bride there that's why the message is so important in this day amen and that's why you've got to proclaim the message of the hour not only to a preacher amen preaching behind the pulpit amen but you you you parents preaching it to your children amen don't tell them about Davy Crockett and the lies and and this this is where the Prophet don't get them all messed up in Disney don't get them all messed up in the fairy tales amen tell them about Jesus Christ of what God has done in this age it'll mature them it'll it'll it'll mature you understand amen because there's a it's not it's not natural age that matures amen we're not talking about that we're talking about maturing and ripening in the presence of the so in ain't that right amen so they could be they could be 10 years old and ripening amen and knowing and ripening more than adults can yes sir they're going to be part of this Brad they're they're going to be part of this this bright revival can you say man now so so uh uh now brother Brown says when when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time God knows it amen so we're not wasting our time amen God knows God knows what seed he planted in this age I I don't believe that we're here at in Blacksburg at Faith Tabernacle wasting our time amen God knows who's the seed that he planted and he's put us here Amen to reach out that seed amen and she's going to be there do you believe that she's going to be there there's going to be a rapture and to think of it if there's no predestinated seed there would not be a Rapture in this age he would have brought the Rapture when there was other seed amen but there is a predestinated seed and they were predestinated for a Rapture they were predestinated for a body change ain't that right God predestinated a church to be there without spot or blemish the prophet said now you think of that it's in this age that God would provide a message amen so she wouldn't be spotless or that she would be spotless and without blemish and have no wrinkles it's in this age amen that God would have Supply provide such a message ain't that right amen see so now brother Brahm said he predestinates it by his foreknowledge and there's nothing going to stop it ain't that right so even though we did not come into this world reflecting God's thoughts God's determined that we will for his determined his thoughts are his word his word is his thought and he said his word will come to pass it's going to come to pass so everyone again a man that were in God's thinking at the beginning has a predestinated seed in them that's right got a predestinated seed within you and within that seed within that seed is everything that God thought this church to be everything that that God thought of you everything God taught us to be is in the seat already ain't that right you sinner you drinking you're doping you whatever you was doing a man Corrals and all that but if there was a predestinated seed that's everything that holds all God's thoughts concerning you is in that seed ain't that right it's like the apple seed the apples you really realize that every Apple that that tiny little old seed will produce years and years and years and years amen is already in the seed it's there the life is there and God predestinated how many apples would be in that seed ain't that right it may bring forth for 20 years 30 years and yet God had already put every Apple predestinated every Apple to be in that seed and knows the number of apples that that seed will will have ain't that right well if he will take notice about a little old apple seed that we look and say well it's it's you don't get apples or we need to cut that thing down or we need to do this this this that God takes care he knows he understands you understand well if he does it about a little seed what he does he do about his church what does he do about his own thinking ain't that right amen so he he put you in this world Amen uh uh uh uh and and put a predestinated seed within you amen all of his thoughts amen so now but but with that apple seed it takes the dirt everybody say it takes the dirt takes the water takes the sunshine takes the right atmosphere for that seed to manifest what's in it do you believe it see so everything the dirt the sunshine the rain the the moisture all the the right atmosphere and and all of these things work together they work together a man uh uh uh to to to to so that that seed can bring forth of its kind see it's the same goes a man for all that are part of the ministry of God Amen see there we talked about there's the ministry of angels there's the ministry of the Holy Spirit and and we've we've gone into that there is the ministry of the prophets there is the ministry of the fivefold amen the Evangelist Pastor teacher missionary prophet and there there's the ministry of the saints that Paul talks about it it's it's all it's same Ministry it's God's ministry right there's other Ministries that ain't part of God's Ministry but I'm talking about God's Ministry amen and all of these and and there's the faithful Ministry the ministry of the prophet it's the ministry of the Holy Spirit the ministry of Angels the ministry of the Saints and they all work together for the same purpose ain't that right in the ministry of the Saints there are singers there's musicians there's prophesires there's they're speaking in the tongues there's interpretation of tongues there's visions and dreams there's Gifts of healing and I I'll even say it this way there's fathers and mothers within the ministry of the Saints can you say man how we need Godly men and women my Godly fathers and Godly mothers and and and there's testifiers those that witness and and these things and within the ministry of the Saints there's helps and there's governments such as trustees and deacons and Treasurer and the janitor and and the pillars of the church and and you've got all of these things within the ministry and and and notice it all works together it all works together to make sure that that predestinated seed comes to life and grows ain't that right now Ephesians 4 11 it says and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers why does he give them for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry and remember the perfecting of the Saints is not religion not religious people amen but for those thoughts that elected seed that God had in his thinking before the foundation of the world for the perfecting of that seed for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ which is the seed ain't that right amen until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of a stature of the fullness of Christ you realize that only ones that will come to a perfect man and the fullness and the stature of Jesus Christ is that elect that was eternal in God's mind before the foundation of the world can you say amen and that's our whole goal is to bring that men that that that elect to a perfection that we hence forth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him ain't that right grow up into him and that's that's the whole point of ministry is that they could grow up into him in All everybody say all all things amen see which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which supply of uh which every joint supply of according to the effectual working in the measure of every part makeeth the increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now the 29th verse of the same chapter it says let no corruption uh communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good everybody say that which is good to the use of edifying do the use of edifying this isn't just making people feel good you can go to you can go to that that Minister church at the word in Texas where he just smiles and everybody feels good when they leave that's not what edifying is talking about business the church and how you how you how you you know how you do your business and how you do this and positive thinking and and all that that's not it that's not what Paul is saying about edifying we already talked I mean Pete Paul has already laid it down in uh to us it's it's an edifying and we'll get here in just a minute but it says but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearer ain't that right well uh uh so now now he uses this word edifying uh three times in this in this chapter I believe and and the word edifying is to form to build establish ain't that right so when we're coming to edify I mean that that's that's the whole point of ministry Amen to edify to form to build to establish now now let's look at what this edifying is in first Timothy 1 4 Paul tells us what kind of edifying it should be neither give he to fables that's not edifying an endless genealogies fables are lies fables is something that ain't truth it can be part truth but it's not all truth remember the Fable was Satan presented a fable to Eve told all the truth about one word so that's what can make a fable just missing one word ain't that right misinterpreting and and misconstruing again and all of these things see neither give he to fables and endless genealogy which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do can you say Amen so so notice The Godly edifying witches in faith or the faith that's the only edifying that that we as as the ministry amen uh uh uh uh can do that's the only edifying that God has called us for is The Godly edifying in the faith can you say amen and according to the Bible there's only one faith that was the face of the Apostles it ain't the faith of the Catholics it ain't the faith of the Baptist we've got all kinds of faiths today but back in the original there was only one faith that Paul was talking about and when God places a person in the ministry that Ministry is for Godly edification which is in the faith amen ain't that right in the last stage there's only one message that deals with the faith and that's the message of the hour that was brought to us by Mount the prophet of Malachi 4. and you say amen and everyone under this ministry of of Malachi 4 is to proclaim the faith edify in the faith can you say Amen are there other Ministries don't count just hate to say it other Ministries ain't bringing them into a Rapture ain't bringing them into the perfect thought of God Amen but this message is to restore us back to the faith ain't that right see so that that that's the message of the hour is to restore back amen not not to to what somebody else said or thought but back to the faith so this message is the only thing that meets the qualification of what Paul was talking about concerning Godly edification which is in the faith you don't need to read books of psychology to better it to be better edified amen you don't need a license to be a professional counselor to edify people you you don't need to read books on how to be a better wife or to be a better husband to be better how Godly edified amen well if your message people you can say Amen to that you don't need uh Dr Dobson you don't need whatever I tell you a lot of these that are right these books are unregenerated foolish virgin maybe I don't care and whatever it ain't to the bride as much as this bride this message ain't to the foolish virgin it ain't to anyone else it's to the bride can you say Amen so you don't need to you don't need books to tell you how to be a better parent you can't be Godly edified in the Faith by them things you don't need books on how to deal with your child can you say Amen you you don't need that the prophet of the hour has told us how to do it it teaches you how to be a better parent how's to teach you how to deal with your child how it teaches you how to be uh how to handle yourself in the church how a minister should handle themselves the deacons should handle themselves home should be everything parents wives every Everything can you say Amen Godly edification which is in the faith comes by the message and the message alone ain't that right so now God has a ministry that's going to Proclaim this message and we as Ministers of this message are not to minister questions and I'm going to say it this way parents are not to minister questions any any part of the ministry that is part of the the the the the message of the hour should not Minister questions hello now you may have questions on how to be whatever get to the message you'll find answers and you say man so now I I'm I'm not saying that any of us are ministering questions here in the church I'm just establishing what this message is about and what Ministry is about we're not to minister questions we're not to bring questions as much as we are to give the answers why we've got the answers the book has been opened can you say amen and it's not to the educated that can understand these Mysteries amen the most uneducated the most dumbest individual can understand the mystery of this book when the Holy Ghost comes in and begins to reveal it can you say Amen so see anyone who ministers questions do so because they don't believe the message that God has seen or they don't understand so when they try to tell us that well that's a prophet was opinion and he's this and he's that what you do in your ministering questions we understand it ain't a no-brainer that brother Brown was a man the point is is the Holy Ghost God himself had his picture taken with that man to let you know don't you question it this message is an authority it's the headship not brother Adam the message and you say Amen so so we find that that that the ministry works the ministry of God works for the edification of the Saints why to bring them thoughts of God to what God thought them to be in the original God said let there be light God said Remember the world was without form it was dark it was it was chaotic and yet God would speak and the Bible says that the spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the deep what was it it was there as God's agent God's Ministry to bring what God thought to pass what God Said to pass can you say Amen well I believe there's thoughts of God that still come to pass in this age you believe it and and and to think we ought to feel honored that God did not leave his thoughts to to some denomination they ain't got the ability to handle it they're too busy preaching Creeds and dogmas but he's still got a People that he's he's reserved for his ministry now notice the ministry of God works for the edifying of the Saints second Corinthians 12 and and look look at the desire the burden of Paul and and and and I believe that's for everyone that is is working in Ministry God's Ministry behold the third time is second Corinthians 12 14 behold the third time I'm ready to come to you and I will not be burdisome to you for I seek not yours but you how different that is from today's program they want your money they want everything that you got but they ain't interested in you the cowards behind the pulpit they watered down this this gospel afraid to tell it just like it is because they're more interested in numbers and then they say they're getting so saved ain't that right but in all reality they're interested in their program they're interested in what they're accomplishing so they come up with this well God look at me I've got a million here presented to you and yet they're bobbed hair painted up Jezebels there ain't a gospel one that that they preached that that that delivered them people they're not reflecting the Eternal thoughts of God they're Bound by their movies they're Bound by this and they're Bound by Hollywood they're Bound By The Rock and Roll they're Bound by all kinds of spirits Bound by the spirit of sports they're Bound by the spirit of fashion can you say Amen but Paul amen he would say I'm not seeking yours I'm seeking you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children notice 15th verse and I will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly I love you the less I Be Loved why because he wouldn't compromise on the gospel ain't that right but be it so I did not burden you nevertheless being crafty I caught you with guile see did I make Gain of you by any of them whom I whom I sent unto you I desire Titus with him and with him I sent a brother see did Titus make Gain of you walk we not in the same Spirit what we not in the same steps again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before God in Christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying amen can you say man so because the ministry is given for the edification of the church is why Paul would set the church in order now I'm going to read a chapter it's going to be lengthy but you follow me First Corinthians the 14th chapter he in setting the church order he in order he specifically deals with the the gift of tongues and the interpretation of tongues and notice now First Corinthians 14 1 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speak of not unto men but unto God for no man understandeth him how be it in the spirit he speaketh what Mysteries but he he that prophesies speak of Unto men to edification and exhortation and to comfort but he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifyeth who himself but he that prophesies edifyeth the church I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather uh uh that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues except he interpret that the church everybody say the church may receive edification ain't that right so so okay it's good to speak in tongues amen we we're not against tongues but just to speak in tongues it's not for the education of the church and you say amen amen you're only serving yourself you're only edifying yourself that's all it it comes to ain't that right but there's got to be a Ministry for the edification of the Saints ain't that right so six verse now Brethren if I come into you speak with tongues what shall I profit you now this is you know and and so I'm gonna go on so this this is why Pentecostals got themselves in trouble and here's why the prophet really got only them Pentecostals because they thought tongues were better than the preaching so here's a preacher under the anointing a prophet of God under the anointing preaching edifying the church and someone would raise up start speaking in tongues right in the middle of it all all right sir ain't that right now that's nonsense and anyone in the message that does that is wrong so now Brethren if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine that's the edification even even things without Life Giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped in or heart for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle now you say well we don't see a lot of those things that we used to see you know why it's not that the prophet done away with it he put it in its per in its it's it's it's uh uh order he put it in in its right perspective to get away from all this uncertain sound get it ain't time for uncertain sounds we ain't got time for it we want to be edified Amen to where we can be ready for a rapture ain't that right so he says see if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle so likewise ye except you utter by the Tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken now and and the prophet we can go on and I'm not I'm not going to get into all of it like we could and probably should sometime but the prophet already told us you know when someone's interpreting don't quote scriptures don't don't do it repetitious [Music] anyone can do that but just read the Bible it'll tell you that you don't need to disrupt a service for that ain't that Ryan see but a lot of it they just won their own little Ministry shown so except you utter my tongue by the Tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for you shall speak into the air there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification therefore if I know not the meaning of The Voice I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me even so ye for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church ain't that right wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret for if he pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful what is a thin I will pray with the spirit I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also ain't that right we could go in that too but we'll wait else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupyeth the room of the unlearned say Amen at the giving of things seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest for thou verily give us things well but the other is not edifying you understand what I'm saying I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all see yet in the church I had rather speak five words with understanding that by my voice I might teach others also then ten thousand words in an unknown tongue then you say amen and I say to you tonight or this morning anyone that preaches outside this message is just unknown tongues it's a mess of confusion I'd rather someone preach the message of the hour that has an understanding of this Bible then you say Amen thank God for the ministry of the of the message amen so brethren be not children in understanding albeit in Malice be children but in understanding be men in the law it is written with men and of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the Lord say that again with men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people yet for all that will not hear they uh will they not hear me saith the Lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying service not for them that believe not but for them which believe ain't that right if therefore the whole church be come together in one place and all speak with tongues and they're coming those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that you are mad if all prophesy or but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or un uh one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face now brother bran tells us that's exactly what it should be is the secrets of the heart made manifest not just preaching a sermon man yeah so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth how is it then Brethren when you come together every one of you hath the psalm at the doctrine at the tongue at the Revelation hath an interpretation let everybody say it with me let all things be done unto edifying If any man speaking an unknown tongue Let It Be everybody say Let It Be by two or at the most by three Witnesses right now put that Witnesses because the prophet said that's what it should be by and that by course and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak unto himself and and to God let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge if any man be revealed or if anything be revealed to another that sent us by let the first hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for God is not the author of confusion but a peace as in all the churches of the Saints ain't that right so then we find that the working of the ministry is for the edification of the Saints the predestinated of God first Thessalonians 5 11 wherefore Comfort yourselves together and what edify one another even as also you do so again edifying one another is Godly edification which is in the faith the faith amen so now God's man is God's agent and the scriptures testified to this fact Abel Noah Abraham Daniel uh Jeremiah Ezekiel on and on you know uh we're part of God's agents do you believe that amen they stayed right with the message that God had given them but then there were women that were I believe that were agents as well that were part of the Bible and that was Ruth Esther Rebecca Tamar uh uh Rahab the Harlot Sarah Anna the shunamite woman on and on you could go of of of women who were agents uh in the ministry you you look today God used them women to testify their very lives their very actions testify of God's grace testify of this church in this age testify of the Bride Can you say Amen also there was the women who Paul said that labored with him in the gospel they were not preachers but yet they labored with Paul in the gospel just like you sisters here at the church sister Rhonda Sister Lisa cleaning the church that's part of the ministry you're laboring in the gospel sister Melissa and now uh Sister Kim Brum till teaching Sunday school you sisters that you know who helped you know here at the church with the music you know and helping out with the sound sister Bethany handing out the birthday cards Etc Sister Kim weeks organizing the food and for our meeting and you sisters who help her with everything you are laboring you're laboring with me as the pastor in the gospel and every one of us was furthering this message I will tell you we're laborers with brother Branham in this gospel we're laborers and you say Amen what is it you're part of the ministry you're part of the ministry in the Saints of the Saints you men you you you you you you you musicians you're part of the ministry laboring the god with the gospel doing your part can you say Amen it's the ministry of the Saints and we should value that Ministry I I I I I think of this you know that that that we we you know when when you go downstairs don't don't talk about life don't talk about and joke around about everything why we we got it you're you're important in this thing it'd be like you know the preacher you know talking about Golf and talking about the baseball games and talking about this just before he's getting behind the pulpit you don't want to do them things you want to stay focused on this thing because everything we're doing is poor the ministry we want to be anointed in what we do ain't that right now notice what the prophet said God works through agents men you believe that man man is God's agent to always not Creeds not denominations but man God never worked through Machinery or will never worked through denominations they die as soon as they organize so then what is it if God sends somebody he's going to send a man if God sends anything he's going to send a woman boy or girl all right don't count yourself out you might be used to to witness to someone to some woman with your long hair long dress in a modesty there's so many times as someone goes up to my wife's man I love your long hair it's a testimony it's an agent can you say Amen see God does nothing outside of a man being his agent his helper well what about you mothers I'm just sitting here and through life no you're an agent you're God's helper we've read it so many times but brother Brown said let me draw just drop on a little token here that I touched on the other night to you mothers he said I mean he's prayed for your loved ones there you are again you're your inheritance you understand that your inheritance Paul told the Romans told the Romans said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved if you've got enough faith faith enough for your own self to be saved have faith everybody say have faith enough have faith enough why you're God's agent have faith enough no matter how Wayward that boy is or that girl is they'll be saved anyhow God somehow if he has to lay them on their back now when he starts going to work don't you complain about it let him do his job it could be him answering your prayer can you say Amen he said it's God somehow if he has to lay them on their back Lane there in the hospital dying they'll be saved God promised it that God uses you as an agent look at this Matthew 9 37 then he then saith he unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the labors are few pray ye now notice there's Jesus telling his disciples pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his Harvest brother Bram says in other words Jesus was saying pray to me for he was the lord of the Harvest pray to me that I will send laborers into my Harvest which I'm just telling you is such an easy thing right he's telling them he's the lord of the Harvest and he's telling them we need to send laborers now pray for the lord of the Harvest pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he'll send it now brother Brown said see part of it lays in human beings the kingdom of God everybody say the kingdom of God the kingdom of God lays within the human being now Jesus said in one place I'm the vine you are the branches the vine can't bear fruit the branches in the vine bears fruit God cannot bear fruit of his self it's got to take the church that church that he forelected before the foundation of the world it's got to take you can you say Amen see he he's got to take you uh branches to bear fruit and when you branches are yielded to the vine then the fruit comes forth God wants your hands he wants your eyes he wants your tongue he wants your lips he wants your ears he wants your hands and feet so that he can bring forth fruit through you so see he could not even though he knew that we needed laborers in the in the field for the Harvest he could not send them until they prayed for it you have a part to do every one of us have a part you say well if it's all predestinated why are we doing because you've got a part right you got to part in this edification can you say Amen brother Brown said we are partners with him look Ephesians 4 and 7. I hope this all right but unto every one of us has given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascendeth send it up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now I'm not going to keep you much longer but he gave gifts unto men not all gifts are the same nor are they all used in the same capacity ain't that right now you say well I'm preaching the message like someone else and yet I'm not getting much look like a lot of results like this brother is it doesn't matter just keep preaching the message God's given you your ministry and what you are to do in the Bible there were Minor Prophets and Major Prophets Why Not all men are the same not all Ministries are the same can you say amen God is a god of variety not all angels are the same ain't that right some have different positions than other Angels some have some angels have different tasks than the others see so the the the creation of the world proves that God is a god of variety God made the mountains but it ain't just made every Mountain the same some are higher than others some are big mountains little mountains right I I think we would qualify for little mountains here in Virginia and and and God would make the The Valleys some deeper than others see God God's just a god of variety in every way he's got the planes and the and the and and the deserts he's he's got the uh uh Four Seasons and and all these things then then watch brother Brown goes into this some men are real blusterous some are real dogmatic others are fine and others are kind you just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom you could not judge you cannot judge Peter by Andrew Andrew stayed on his knees all the time praying ain't that right Peter was a fire brand and preached and so forth see so then then you look at Paul Paul was different than them both he was more scholarly like a prophet set back see Andrew he had no he prayed all the time and he had no part in writing the Bible right Peter look at Peter Peter always stands out to everybody he was something else and yet God allowed him to write two books of the Bible Paul now he was the scoundrel he was out to kill every Christian persecuting Christ and yet God had somethings in store for him and God allowed him to write most of the New Testament ain't that right he's the one that set the word of God in order he's the one that separated the law from grace and put it it's in its place can you say man but they were all God's agents and were part of his ministry brother Brown said the people had need of a Healer so God sent Peter to do that specific work but Peter did not have the love in his heart that John had for John was love he was God's agency of love ain't that right the Bible tells of Peter James and John Peter was a faith he represented faith James represented hope John represented uh charity Faith was in Peter Hope was in James charity was in John and yet all three men were God's Representatives amen so then in this ministry a man must work within the capacity that God has allotted him this is why brother Brown said you Pastor should never tell a prophet what to do you evangelist uh never tell a pastor see each one has his office if it's perfectly identified ain't that right now as as as we wrap it up but I want to I want to just leave this with you that man being God's agent does not take away from the Holy Ghost being God's agent amen how often that people lean upon their own ability their own style their own capability and leave out the Holy Ghost ain't that right but the prophet said God operates by the Holy Ghost through man God's the holy spirit is God's agent can you say Amen and as we then we read where as as we read earlier I am the vine Jesus said I am the vine you're the branches without me you can do nothing the church everybody say the church is his agency brother Brown said see the branch that the holy spirit is working through he speaks through the pastor's lips he works through his hands and through Divine gifts he has set his body into motions led by the Holy Spirit by emptying himself out and letting the Holy Spirit take control he brings messages he sees visions and great things no matter what it might be that God has chosen him to do if he will yield to the spirit see he's talking to the body now if you'll yield to the spirit God will work through him or any member of his church God's Church God works through the Holy Spirit to bring these things and you say man do you love him Jesus said in my name you shall cast out Devils shall speak with new tongues take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover brother Brown said what is it he's stretching forth his holy hand to heal by the agency of his church it's the ministry amen you love him if the musicians will come Matthew 18 18. Jesus said verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven you see men are just men but they're God's agency see the church natural has got it all wrong as I've said earlier they want the best musicians they want the best preachers they want the best choirs they want the best dress they want the best of everything they want the best see and and it's gotten to a money thing preachers the prophet said you know the evangelists he won't come to a church unless he gets so many thousands of dollars [Music] and it he says it comes to a place that soul-saving is is a business but he said Soul savings not a business of the church it's the power of the Holy Ghost in the church Soul Saving is God's you don't buy it with money all of it is see works works works paid evangelists paid song leaders paid choirs everything else God don't want that it's all works God doesn't want Works he wants the Holy Spirit working in you [Music] it's the holy spirit all along can you say man we call the man a prophet Moses Elijah David Ezekiel brother Branham Prophets but it's the holy ghost that is really the prophet but what was it the Holy Ghost was able to get in that man and that man would surrender himself and God would use that gift that he placed within that man ain't that right well that that that's the same thing with with it all see it was the Holy Ghost is the one that showed Visions it's the Holy Ghost the one that that discerned the hearts and intents and thoughts of the heart it's the holy ghost that done them things well then what about the church today get a people so surrender to God and the same God the same holy spirit will take over their body and we'll use them use you use me in the capacity that he's called us to do and whatever capacity it is it's for the edifying the church the elect the saints of God can you say Amen you love the Lord amen amen amen I want to live [Music] the way wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more I I could never ever out love the Lord is that the way you feel sing it again I want to live the way Jesus wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to lie love till there's just no more love never ever out love the Lord oh I want to live do you want to live the way he wants you to live hallelujah hallelujah oh I want to give until theirs give like that little Lily give of your fragrance Grill what God has put in you give give it out Hallelujah [Music] I could never ever out love the Lord [Music] oh Jesus Use Me Lord don't refuse me surely there's a work that I can do [Music] and even though it's humble Lord help my will to crumble [Music] oh the cross be great I'll work for you sing it again oh Jesus use me don't refuse me [Music] surely there's a work that I can do [Music] and even though it's humbled Lord help my will to crumble [Music] though the cross be great I'll work for you you handle the cross be great I'll work for you oh he's so wonderful to us amen I'm so glad to be part of the ministry of God in this age amen knowing knowing knowing that God is still working through a church through a body I believe you know the Bible Paul talks about it but everything that God has done is so that he could have preeminence in the church and I believe it's in this age that he's able to have full preeminence within his body and I'm so glad to be part of that amen and I want him to have more preeminence in my life so much because as we know this is the hit ship this message is our headship Say Amen amen we gonna argue with the headshot Hallelujah you want to be used of God in a great way I love the Lord remember uh this Saturday M's graduation party for those that would like to come you're all invited to come starting around two o'clock for games Fellowship whatever dinner I guess supper is at six and also remind her just to bring your chairs we're going to have it not at the house but where we where we had it's the Riverview Holiness Church where we had our fourth of July Gathering and they were kind to let us use their place again and we certainly appreciate that but uh so if you'd like to come we'd love to have you [Music] remember uh service tonight 4 30 we have in communion and looking forward to that amen God bless you appreciate you very much love you may you have a wonderful afternoon [Music] let's just bow our heads in word of Prayer Shalom you want to dismiss us foreign
