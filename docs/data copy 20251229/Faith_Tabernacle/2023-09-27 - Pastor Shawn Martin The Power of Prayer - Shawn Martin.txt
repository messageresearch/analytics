have your way knowing both speaker and here is our prayer father May Faith be built up in us tonight we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord uh James the fifth chapter and maybe just start at the 14th verse is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith everybody say the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him amen you can have your seats this evening and um I'm just going to I guess use the title uh the prayer of faith uh been speaking on prayer past a couple Wednesday nights and why we should pray but um just thinking of on the prayer of faith and I understand that the scripture that we've read is talking of laying on hands hands on the sick but my my main focus is the the prayer of faith uh I I believe it is important that we as Believers pray it is it is something and and I think maybe all of us are battled in that area where Satan tries to keep us from praying so much easier to do the other things to voice our thoughts divorce our opinions to avoids try to change things uh in our own selves and it's so hard to pray but we should pray in times of testing and trials we we should pray when things go wrong we should pray when it seems as though God has forsaken us we should pray when it our back is against the wall not only in the good times should we pray but when all hell is against us we we should pray because God moves on the scene when we pray as the prophet taught us prayer changes things it's the greatest weapon that is known to man given into our hands and and and we know that for for whatever question or whatever need that we have Christ is the answer and the prophet said Faith brings Christ to us Faith does a man and therefore we must have faith when we pray and so the the the the prayer of faith isn't just uh when we lay hands on the sick but uh that that should be the the prayer that anyone would pray every believer prays anytime you pray is the prayer of faith but we are to live by faith we are to walk by faith we are to speak by faith we are to Pray by faith everything it is is by faith brother Brandon would tell us Faith knows no defeat faith is perfect Faith brings things when there is no things to be brought for Faith creates uh Faith takes doubt away takes negative away and makes positive in another place he says and this was to me profound but he says we lose our Glory if we lose faith we lose our Glory if we lose Faith you see God has called us for his name and when we become powerless and defeated then we lose our identity as to what his purpose was for calling us a man he called us for a reason he called us for a purpose and when when we become defeated when we become weak and when we become powerless then we're we totally lose the identity amen because we want to identify with his purpose and our lives we want to identify with why he called us we we want to identify with with his mind and and these things and God has not called us to be weak God did not call us to be powerless God did not call us to be estranged from his his everything that belongs to us and all that he years and so when we look at Faith Abraham showed that he had Faith by calling those things that were not as though they were and and that was the sign of Faith a man and and that was actually the works of Abraham he called those things that were not as though they already were they did not exist but he acted and talked as though they existed he hadn't as of yet received the promise and yet he talked and acted as though he had already received the promise and he never wavered ain't that right that that was his faith he never wavered and and so his faith brought every promise that God had made to him into existence amen because that is the power of Faith a man uh power and authority is manifested winter ever faith is because that that's what faith is and brother Branham said all this power of God that we're talking about is accessible To Us by faith amen there's not one element of God that you cannot have uh if you have faith a man all the powers of God Amen is at our disposal by faith amen uh brother Branham says in another place Faith leads you to the power amen says so we're not to be victims we're not to be powerless we're not to be defeated we're not to be Beggars we are to have faith and Faith puts us in contact with the power of God a man thinking of the woman with the issue of blood you know by her having brother Branham said a a her having a personal faith in Jesus being the Son of God Paul hold the power of God through him to her amen now you think of that he had all the power invested in him for he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me but she knew how to pull that power through him to her and that was by her faith she may she may have not been recognized among the the names of men she may have not had a great uh uh uh whatever uh uh uh uh in among the society but she had Faith to pull the power of God through him to her and so is it today ain't that right a man sees so brother Branham would actually say in this great room here where the power of God has bottled down Satan can no more stand where faith is than a person could exist where tear gas is falling it'll have to go out and you say Amen you see Satan cannot no more stand when a person is there with faith a man a man says so uh that means them that that your prayer if it's a prayer of faith then your prayer has more power than the Angels it has more power than the laws of the land it has more Powers than the devil could ever ever ever even think to obtain is when you begin to pray the prayer of faith now First Peter 1 and 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled that fate is not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation Nation a man ready to be revealed in the last time amen so so not only is the inheritance kept by the power of God but I believe that every one of us the the elect of God are kept by the power of God through faith a man unto salvation ain't that right faith is talked about a lot but faith is so essential to our lives amen not just to get uh ask God to save you but it's so essential is is the main part of us going in a Rapture is coming to a perfect Faith a man so if brother Brown said if the church would put more faith to work you would see more things taking place in the church see it's it's not God that needing to do something it's God waiting for us to exercise the faith ain't that right it's an exercise the faith amen there there is no other prayer can you say that with me there is no other prayer more effective than than the prayer of faith amen you can whine about your prayer you can pray and whine you you can pray and beg you can pray and want your your prayer could be full of wishing and that do you no good if it's not the prayer of faith amen it has to be the prayer of faith amen because it's that prayer that has the authority and the power amen behind it the prayer of faith Works amen John 15 7 says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you look at the prayer amen when when when the word is abiding in you and you are abiding in Christ amen watch the prayer go to work then whatever you shall ask it shall be given unto you Mark 11 24 therefore I say unto you what so what things so ever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them do you believe that is that not a promise a man believe that you receive them and you shall have them see so that is a Divine promise of God Amen we should never go around woe is me woe is me if you just only knew if if you know and looking for sympathy and looking for someone just to Pat us on the back and and I'm not sending words of encouragement are great and and it it does help it itifies and and we should edify one another in all of these things but you're not weak if you have faith in your prayer ain't that right to pray the prayer of faith now now notice what brother Branham says we are bringing our faith to test it against the power of the devil right isn't that amazing don't don't dare to test anything against the power of the devil but if you'll take Faith amen don't take your abilities don't take your mind don't take your intellect don't take your talents don't take nothing but it will bring our faith Amen to to test it against the power of the devil every time you pray the prayer of faith you're bringing it to a test against the power of the enemy amen no matter how dark it is put your faith to the test against the power of the devil ain't that right now Hebrews 11 and 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh or God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now we talked about this before but now think of it he that comes to God must believe that he is ain't that right not just believing that he exists but believing that he is believe that he is everything that he says he is a man believed that he is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us not worketh in heaven not worketh in angels not work as a man in in himself amen but the power that now works in you and I can you say amen amen is God able to do it amen do you know what power that you have in you amen you have the power of deity living in you amen uh if you've got the Holy Ghost you do a man deity is not in heaven deity is in you ain't that right so according to the power that worketh in us he is able to do it far exceedingly abundantly that you could ever ask or even think amen say so faith is the power that worketh in US Amen brother Branham said faith is the purchasing power amen another place he said you have to have a willing heart and God sends his faith down sends his power for faith is power can you say amen amen you you say well I just want more power no you need more faith a man for faith is the power faith is the access Amen to anything of God Amen you've got all the promises right here all you need to do is have the faith can you say amen amen so don't make your prayer a beg a prayer a begging don't make your a prayer a big a a prayer of a uh of a uh Vagabond amen you're a child of the king a man with a faith a man for whatever you ask so you've got to come to him believing that he is your God you must not not come to him wondering if he is but you you see we must believe what the Bible says he is ain't that right everything you you say well I've got if I've got to come to him believing that he is and how do I know what he is well the Bible tells you what he is he is Jehovah Jireh he is the Shalom he is your peace he is your provider he is everything that you have now he's the wheel in the middle of the wheel ain't that right amen he's everything he's the Fourth Man In The Fire he's the one he's the one that would show up in the Daniel and the Lion's Den ain't that right amen he's the one he's the one in the burning bush and and and so we must come to him believing he is what we have already experienced him to beat now I want to ask you how many has ever experienced him to be a Healer have you experienced him to be a savior have you experienced him to be a way man well most of you have amen I believe just a show of hands God looks at them things amen amen and if God has ever done anything for you amen we ought to just lift up our hand and say yes I'm one of them I've experienced God I I know what it is see so then you come to God not only what the Bible says but what you have experienced him to be in your life amen don't you let the devil don't you let your trial take your experiences away to where you come to the your prayer amen and you don't even know how to thank God for what he's done for you in the past amen we get so gloomy and we get so uh in the dumb so we get so looking at the present that we forget that God done something for us in the back in the years past yesterday even and if he'd done something for us yesterday why can't he do it today so we may come to him believing that he is didn't you say man in order to believe that he is we must become acquainted with him I think we must become acquainted in the best way for a man to get acquainted with God Is by a new birth for the Jean seed of God is then quickened In You by a new birth and then what happens you become a part of God the life of God is now in you ain't that right then what did the prophet say then you can believe for the impossible amen that's right you can believe in the Supernatural brother Bram said receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes you Abraham's seed and gives you the same faith the same faith that Abraham had that calls those things that are not as though they were no matter how you look what you feel like it's what God said about it so that's the faith that's the prayer faith is an Abraham faith ain't that right yes sir knowing that it's already going to be done before you even pray ain't that right why because you're coming to him and believing that he is not limiting God he's unlimited he's Supreme ain't that right he's omnipotent he's undefeated ain't that right so so to to to get acquainted with him in in such a way is is receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and then see it you're not learning about God then in a a in a history lesson but you are experiencing the realities of God by partaking with him partaking of him second Peter 1 4 says whereby are given unto us great exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through last and man I I trust that we've all escaped the world the corruption I always escape the corruption you've escaped the corruption so then you already know something about what he is he is faithful to his word he is faithful Amen to answer prayers has he not answered your prayers before amen so then you have this concept of really what he is because you've experienced him I was in the gutter but I'm not now what happened God came on the scene and delivered me I know enough of that to know that he is ain't that Ryan brother Brown said if you really come to God and got a taste of the Heavenly gifts so God partaker of his divine nature while you could no more become a sinner again what an experience with God to where that you could never One Touch One Touch is an eternal touch and that you could never be a sinner again now you have come up into a place to write you really know who he is amen that's true see so you could never become a sinner again an unbeliever then a stalk of corn could become a cocklebur see why you have escaped the corruption in this world uh that is in the world through lust brother Brown said see you've escaped it see who that's to it's to the church them who are in Christ has been exalted above these things not he exalted himself but Christ has brought him up you you've you come into an experience with him remember the colored sister that testified and she said I ain't what I ought to be ain't what I want to be but one thing sure I ain't what I used to be brother Brown said she had come up from somewhere she had been brought up and he said that's how we know we've passed from Death unto life we look back to the pit where we was hewed from and we're not what we want to be we're not even what we ought to be but one thing we're thankful for we're not what we used to be we're on the road ain't that right seats so that we're coming to God believing that he is the word says that and my experience it has matched it amen praise God then the second thing we come to God we must believe that he is a rewarder everybody say he's a rewarder he's a rewarder when you when you come to God this is how you approach him in prayer he is a rewarder amen talking about a prayer of faith believing that God is and believing that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him so when I come on my knees and get on my knees and begin to utter words I know my prayer is not in vain for he hears my prayer and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him can you say man you see Church you cannot come to him any other way I cannot come to him in in in any other way I pray knowing that he is going to answer my petition and I'll say to you today he is a rewarder of those your prayer is not in vain God answers prayers do you believe that now I have to tell you God doesn't always answer quickly that God does answer prayers some of you might have been praying for years but don't you quit your praying God answers prayer yes sir Amen brother Brown said sometimes he makes us wait for the answer but that doesn't change who and what he is ain't that right amen see and so he says and just because everything's going wrong that's no sign that we should quit praying just pray on any how why because you're coming to him knowing that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him don't give up praying for your loved ones don't give up praying for your health don't give up praying for the church don't give up praying for whatever you're having to eat of God is a rewarder if you don't believe that then you shouldn't pray at all that if you can really believe that he is a rewarder get down on your knees and start uttering them words of Faith because you know it's going to bring Christ to you why do I lay hands on the sick because I believe God answers prayer why do I kneel and pray because I believe that God answers prayer can you say Amen brother Brown said see I have no special prayer I just believe that God is and that he rewards those who seek after him amen see no special power amen no special words that we can utter amen we just got a Heart full of faith knowing that he is and that he rewards those who seek after him ain't that Brian so he answers in his time the way it's best makes it work just right for us ain't that right now there's only one thing that keeps God from hearing our prayer and that's when sin is in a man's life ain't that right because if our heart condemn us then God will not hear us ain't that right amen see but when the prophet said when there is no sin in your life then you know where you're standing with God and I think every day it behooves us to know where we're standing with God can you say amen and the only way that can take that and cause that doubt is When sin is there and we don't know where we're standing with him we don't know amen now a lot of times you don't have to feel him to know where you stand with God Amen but when you know that the blood has been applied you know that you have done everything that God has required and I'm standing here by faith amen look at job now amen job didn't have amen see a lot of things and glittery but he knew this he had already applied the blood amen his prayer had been be called by the blood of Jesus Christ and he knew where he stood with God he knew can you say amen he knew see so when there's no sin in your life the prophet said then you know where you're standing with God why there's no condemnation there's no condemnation ain't that right what then faith can come if there's condemnation you can't have faith try it you can't ain't that right when their sin is there when there's something that is there amen and we made right and we're hiding or whatever you cannot have that correct Faith you can Bluff yourself and Satan cannot be bluffed he knows whether you've got the goods or not ain't that right amen that when there's no condemnation then he says only then can you come to God believing that he is and that he is a rewarder because there's nothing there condemning your prayer amen the prayer of faith brother Brown said see if our heart doesn't condemn us then we have this assurance that God answers prayer ain't that right so notice the prayer of faith must be prayed Romans 10 and 17 it says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now I'm going to get somewhere and it'll be simple I'm sure but but and you probably already know all these things but we're going to bring it to uh your remembrance amen Faith cometh by hearing we're talking about the the prayer of faith that's the only prayer that's going to work it's the prayer of faith amen see so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and now the prophet tells us to hear means to understand Amen to hear means to understand so we'll we'll set this way Faith cometh by understanding and understanding by the word amen that's right see amen now so many lives are powerless because people are simple when it comes to the power of God they don't understand it their prayers are powerless amen their Christian Life is powerless amen because they have no understanding of of the power of God Amen see so brother Graham talk of spoke of the school of prophets in in Elijah's day saying that there was a lot of carnal impersonations how that the school of the prophets were up there training to be prophets and how simple everybody say how simple they were how simple they were till they even they couldn't understand the power of God Amen see so when you to pray the prayer of faith our understanding has got to be enlightened to understand that I'm not praying to a goddess Stone I'm not praying to a god of wood I'm not praying to a god at the same way that a that a Hindu would pray to their God and Muhammad would pray to their God that this one would pray to their God I'm praying to a god that I have an understanding of he is all-powerful he is all Supreme we have this understanding of that the power of God now he says they thought the power had lifted Elijah up and thrown him out on the mountain somewhere they had sent a search party to hunt for him when Elisha knew good and well that God had taken him to glory amen see that they didn't have the understanding of the power of God but Elisha had those understanding he understood that it was the power of God that lifted him a translated Elijah amen see God had taken him and he escaped death by going home to God on a chariot of fire and Horses of fire can you say Amen so people don't understand the power of God today they don't understand that the power of God is here Amen to change lives they don't understand that it's the power of God that fixes marriages they don't understand that it's the power of God that sets the captive free they don't understand that it's the power of God that breaks the Fetters off of people's lives it doesn't matter how drunk a person is it doesn't matter how addicted a person is to drugs it doesn't matter how how much and shamble a person's life is it's the power of God that can break it if the power of God changed you that same power will change somebody else amen but the people are powerless in their religion in their prayer is because they have no understanding of the power of God that they pray to they don't understand that it's the power of God that is going to pick us up and catch us away but brother Brown said Elijah was elected to it Elisha was elected to it amen you understand what I'm saying the others were trying to tap into it through their schooling and their conferences and their seminars and and their training and all of that I don't care how much trains you are you've got to come to an understanding of the power of God it's the power of God that's going to change your life it's the power of God that's going to change your body it's the power of God can you say amen and if you notice Elijah didn't have to be schooled Elisha didn't have to be schooled can you say man their faith didn't need to rest there or their faith did not rest in some 10-step program Amen on how to be better and how to be closer with God and how to walk with God and how to be a better this and a better that and a better this they didn't read all these books and all of these things that are out there today they are Faith rested in the understanding of the power of almighty God can you say amen and I'll tell you I don't care how weak of a Christian you are I don't care how impossible you are I don't care how hopeless your situation is if you can have the understanding of what the power of God is to you amen then you can come and pray the prayer of faith amen and that faith will tap you in to the power of God brother random says I want you to listen and give the time in and be just as reverent as possible especially while we're speaking because if you don't get the words that we have to place in each night then you come to the platform not knowing what you're coming for you understand that God does not want us we're upset this way we're past we're past the stage of not coming to God and not knowing what we're coming for you must understand everybody say I must understand brother Brown said see you must understand you must come with an understanding and that's the way Christ wants us to come you have to have faith in what you're doing if you don't you just going to kind of come in half Hazard well I hope so it'll never happen I can't happen see amen see well you can't have faith if you're going to come like that you must thoroughly everybody say You must thoroughly you must thoroughly know beyond the shadow of a doubt you must thoroughly know what you're going or doing and know it's going to happen amen hello we do not pray because it's just our duty we do not pray because it's just a ritual no not the bride not the elect we've entered to an understanding because we have relationship with him amen amen you know what you're doing you know it's going to happen then you're positive then then that it's going to happen now Faith we'll move on here there are two kinds of faith which means there's two kinds of understanding if Faith cometh by hearing understanding and understanding comes by the word there's two kinds of Faith the prophet told us two types whatever you say that one type is the intellectual faith in other words intellectual understanding and the other is heart faith which is an understanding that comes by revelation that comes not to the mind but to the heart and and Romans 10 10 it says for with the heart everybody say with the heart man believeth under righteousness it never said with the Mind man believeth under righteousness so then that type of Faith the intellectual faith gets you nowhere with God but but God would write it down that from the heart man believeth unto righteousness so so now now the Bible tells us that in the in in the last days perilous times shall come and brother Branham after reading that scripture quoting it he says faith will be pretty slow then so so now not talking about just Faith but but that the certain type of faith faith will be slow then which we know he's referring to Heart faith faith that comes by Revelation faith that is dropped down from here down into the heart ain't that right so he says there are two things that we have to watch closely and they are intellectual religion and intellectual faith can you say amen that's what he says two things that we have to watch closely and they are intellectual religion and intellectual Faith so now Faith cometh by hearing so we say it this way heart faith and intellectual Faith both come by hearing the word of God Amen see now you know brother Bram says people come to church and they hear the word but they go out with an intellectual faith amen they hear the word they come to church they hear the word but they go out with an intellectual faith and he says that's the reason you can't believe that's the reason you go back out and sin the way you do the reason you cannot hold up from one Revival to another is because it's intellectual faith and you say man and it says that most everyone has intellectual Faith most of uh churchgoers haven't even your Sinners of America today especially in America it's a religious Nation it's all intellectual Faith intellectual religion intellectual Faith amen throughout the years men have taught the word of God mixing it with their own ideas we've had Bible schools and seminars we've had Bible conferences to learn about the Bible and and so on and learn about God and what it is it's men taking the Bible and teaching it by their own wisdom brother Brown says we uh School our Seminary students in all kinds of Bible theology and things like that man-made Theology and got a bunch of church it just exactly a laodicea like God said it would be and he says oh my when I look at that it makes me shiver pregnated with intellectual conception so there's a phase but it's an by an intellectual conception of the word of God can you say Amen now that that's the problem with this is because the intellectual men are getting behind the pulpit giving an intellectual speech and by doing so they give the people an intellectual Faith who have never received a birth people don't believe they need a birth people don't need to believe that they need to die out can you say Amen because they've got an intellectual Faith but yet their faith has brought them no power their faith has not brought Christ to them can you say amen amen he says see when they got off in seminaries and got boys and men's who men who were brilliant and intellectual and taught out the old baptism of the Holy Spirit they cut the lifeline off and you say Amen so see there is no other way for the people to get any other kind of Faith outside of intellectual faith when when you've got intellectual men teaching by their wisdom and by their understanding and oh yeah brother Brown so they can make the Bible look and paint such a picture but it's all intellectual right now there's no way the other way to get other any other faith and you say Amen no wonder people set dead in the church they sit there without an experience with God no wonder prayer means nothing to them to where they're teaching the people it's just a prayer for everybody to say one prayer and you've been to churches Amen to where they've got a they've got a pamphlet that everybody the whole congregation reads the prayer off that pamphlet that's no good [Music] it's got to be a prayer of faith and you say amen and when it's a prayer of faith you can be out in the woods you can be out in the desert you can be outward nothing else you you can be there and you're needing your washing machine to work and man you ain't got the money to fix it pray the prayer of faith and watch that thing go to work seen it see the prayer of faith now brother Branham notice what he says now I could preach the word he says and you could accept it and say that's all right yeah I believe that well now if that's all the farther it goes then you'll never get far with God because it's intellectual faith hello that's the reason people doesn't get healed is because they only have an intellectual view of it what their mind conceives now now even we we could say it and maybe getting a little Dangerous Ground but you we can say it even with message folks they hear the quotes over and over and over they hear about healing they hear about the power of God they hear about Rapture they hear about this they hear about that I've heard that before I've heard that before I've heard that for years but if it's not bringing power to you can you say man these quotes and these things that brother Brown taught us is not just to make us intellectual is to bring power into our lives is to bring us up out of laodicea it's supposed to bring us up out of lukewarmness it's supposed to bring us up to where we're walking with God as Enoch did and you say man now now you know the quote that don't don't let this quote you know torment your mind by telling you that you must have intellectual Faith because you haven't received your healing yet and Satan can work that quote uh a lot on a person that's been praying and praying and praying and hadn't got the re their healing and things like that genuine Faith knows that God works according to his own time clock and never doubts it and you say man we'll go on here and and you'll understand because intellectual faith will fail everybody say it will fail it will fail under the tests intellectual Faith fails under the test brother Brown said the mind will reason the mind will say it cannot be I I'm no better I my sense of sight says that my arm is no straighter than it was yesterday well you prayed for it see you said oh yeah God is my healer but all of a sudden it's not happening I I I prayed yesterday I prayed a month I I've been praying all this time and it's getting worse see my sense of feeling says I don't feel any better uh any different than I did yesterday see reasoning mental theology will reason and out you say well now wait a minute I believe that's foolishness see your reasoning that intellectual faith will do that amen and you say Amen look at the two and a half million people that left Egypt two and a half million you think of it they left Egypt they left Egypt for the promised land but it proved that they all only had intellectual faith only two entered into the land of the original they were the predestinated of God and and we've talked about brother Brown's talked about it you know and taught us that there were two parts of redemption coming out and entering into they all come out they were all baptized in in the Red Sea they all were under the pillar of fire they all experienced the Miracles they all done that but out when it's all said and done only two went into the second part of redemption can you say man the others took part of the first part amen they they were included in the first part they come out see but they did not go into the completion of redemption can you say amen that's right you know why they come out of Egypt but the prophet said God could not get Egypt out of them ain't that right God could not get Egypt out of them and I'm going to be honest with you will you take a man that has totally come out of the world totally come out of the system of denomination watch his prayer and how different it'll be than the rest of them yeah hey man come on now yes brother Brown said see first you have to come out some people wants to bring the world in with them but you've got to come out of the world to enter into Christ you have to come out of unbelief to enter into Faith there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine Faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of God behind to enter into Faith so you see the prophet's Ministry is to help us leave everything behind no questions to it just say Amen to it and walk into genuine faith leaving everything behind praise God the prophet has told us things that are even our own body doesn't tell us even our own mind won't tell us how would you even stand up and say I'm Justified as though I've never done it but you have to believe it you have to leave all that doubt behind to enter into the faith can you say man and watch your prayer change brother Brian said you always were a son of God it say it right you never were saved on any given day you were always worth saved you have to leave all doubt behind and enter into that and what your prayer change see your prayer then it becomes a prayer faith that we're talking about not intellectual Faith but revelated faith and notice what brother Branham said God has been preparing the people to believe all things aren't you glad you're one of them God preparing us to believe for all things I'm not going to I'm not limiting God I'm not going to dissect everything and say God you can work this out but I'm going to leave that for I got to work this out myself because I I don't I I don't know amen no leave it all to God Leave It All To God can you say man we come to a place to where our faith is so great that we say God you're able to do the small things you're able to do the big things you're able to do the the things that seem silly you're able to do the things that so seem impossible God you're able to do it all I believe that you are it's a faith this bride is actually entering in into this bride amen we're entering into the second phase and and I'm going to be honest I believe we're entered in I believe we're entered in you say well that's the Rapture no no no there's promises here that's attainable what about adoption of sons what about the placing of sons what about the power of God coming back up into the church can you say man amen that's right you can't tell me that you're going to sit here powerless and nothing and no experience with God and that I'm just a church goer and all that and the most the main thing that we could focus on is legalism and the do's and the don'ts and this and that and that's all we know about spirituality there's more to that than there's such a power of God that we could have and if we're not tapped into that here how we going over there brother Ram said you gotta have perfect Faith here not perfect Faith doesn't go over there we don't get perfect fake there we get perfect Faith here that's what the message is all about is to bring us into a perfect faith that when we pray we have power with God when we speak God backs our words up amen amen that's right so we're actually entering into this by this Joshua Ministry in this last day which is the message of the hour I'm sure you believe that Joshua in Hebrew brother Brown said Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end time leader to take the church over Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua can you say man now we have people trying to be saved we have people trying to be healed we have people trying to be delivered we have people try try try there is no such thing as try in Christianity there's no such thing as try with faith but they're trying because it's an intellectual Faith they have faith in the mind but brother Branham says your mind will reason on it and say well now let's see it said this the doctor said this mother said this Dad said this the Pastor said this well see now that's what intellectual faith is oh I believe the Bible yes sir I think it's right but you know you know see you're trying to reason that's intellectual faith you notice what kind of Faith the disciples had before they received the Holy Ghost they walked with Jesus talked with him Peter was a bosom friend of of Jesus but he got so discouraged after Jesus died and was buried and and the Bible tells us that Peter just said well I'm going fish it skip all this I'm I'm going fishing and the other says well if you're going fishing we're going to ain't that right so being discouraged they they picked up their Nets and they went fishing and and all that brother Brian said they were believer ones mental theology but but their faith was dashed we thought this was the one apparently not let's go fishing let's continue what we were before he called us ain't that right but he said it was mental it was mental faith it was mental theology see he said they once believed they believed once in the natural see but when a little trial come up it went all to pieces their faith went to pieces are you with me yeah we kind of making some sense their faith went to Pieces it all went to pieces so this he says this only shows that when a man has only intellectual Faith by saying yes that's the word of God yes I believe that God Rose Jesus up from the dead but if that's all you've got then the first little discouragement that comes up in your church away you go and going out see he says you might be a friend to him but you don't know him in the power of his resurrection he says never one time after Pentecost did that preacher Peter ever say such a thing as that again see when they got ready to kill him they was going to hang him on a cross and he said I'm not even worthy to die like that turn my feet up my head down because my Lord died in that position with his head up yes never never see he was with Christ then but then Christ was in Peter Peter was doing the leading then and after the Holy Spirit come then the Holy Spirit was doing the leading Peter was in the backgrounds and the Holy Spirit Led on he said see if you've just got good reasoning you'll sit down and try to reason out the Bible reason well how could he raise from the dead how could these Miracles and things take place today in this great realm of civilization science that we live in see you try to reason that out and you're just getting further and further away from God all the time don't reason how the miracle is going to come just believe it don't reason how how God is going to save your child don't even try to think of how they're going to come in and how he's going to do it and and which way amen is it possible to figure it out you're dealing you're praying for something that is totally impossible but With God all things are possible so he said you try to reason that out and you get further away from God all the time you'll never know him by reason and God's not known by reason God's known by faith you accept it you believe it you can't do it until something happens in you and then the Holy Spirit comes in and you have the mind of Christ and you say amen he said notice they had all they all fished they fished and they caught no fish very discouraging the next morning early at the Sunrise Service they looked across the bank and there stood Jesus but they didn't know him and he says that's the sad part they didn't know him then you say Amen so see uh uh intellectual faith will not work because it will not bring you into fellowship with God and brother Brown said most most of the church stops at intellectual Faith they know about God but they're dead they're dry they're they're formal they they they they're without an experience and when you get that type of a man behind behind the pulpit he'll make this he'll heal me I'll just be honest he'll make a church service say a a a a a classroom foreign no anointing no Spirit no inspiration you get a man just with just intellectual Faith leading song service he'll quench the spirit every time because he doesn't know anything about the moving of the spirit of God it'll be the same way with musicians it's the same way with choirs it's to say there weren't more worried about the robes than the art the spirit of God you understand what I'm saying see you've got to have the spirit of God so intellectual Faith affects the prayer way the prayer is is prayed brother Brown said you you have intellectual faith and you'll argue every scripture do everything you can backwards and everything else see you say there's no such thing as Divine Healing there's no such thing as heartfelt religion no such thing as the Holy Ghost you'll fuss and stew all the time and know not what you're talking about see he says how can you believe when there's nothing in there to believe with certainly see how can you get blood from a turnip when there's no blood in the turnip see you've got to be born again of the spirit of God or you'll never be able to come on Fellowship grounds with the God Almighty himself see for it's only upon the basis of the shed blood does he receive any believer and how can you believe when there's nothing there to believe with just a carnal Mind through mental conception he said you can't do it that's the reason people don't believe in Divine Healing because they've never walked into that bloodstream to The Fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ he said you got an intellectual Faith oh you believe the word and you mix it and make it suit your theology but once you come into the kingdom of God through the blood of the Lord Jesus meeting upon the shed blood uh bought through the testimony the public testimony of the Crimson blood of the Lord you are here you are in here in Fellowship where God can bless you you can shout praise the Lord and the powers of God working why it's God himself his own body the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ here on Earth operating upon the basis of the shed blood and you say man so then a man cannot accurately pray a prayer of faith with just intellectual faith that brother Graham said when your faith comes out comes from out of the intellectual realm and the Holy Spirit puts it in the soul and the heart you won't even think about these things all right you won't think about well how can it be done well how how when is going to happen well I don't know you won't think about it because it's dropped from the intellectual and to the heart now can you say Amen so then it becomes the the the the prayer of faith that that we're talking about see he said see you won't try it see to see nothing only thing you know that it's going to happen regardless of who says it's not that's it it's in the heart God puts it in there there it is when God puts it in there all the Devils out of Torment Will Never Move it if you if you were laying down now notice what he says if you were laying down grasping gasping your breath and and death rattles in your throat 50 doctors standing around saying he's going out to God in the next five minutes he's leaving now and down in your heart you believe Jesus Christ that healed you that won't bother you a bit why it's faith in the heart just as sure as there's a God in heaven you'd come out of it yes sir because God's Duty bound everybody say God's Duty bound he's got to keep his word and you'll never know what Christ is or what the is the word until first the Holy Spirit has personally revealed it to you in your heart then you know that Jesus is Lord when your heart says so not when your knowledge says so but when your heart said so that's when you know it another place brother Brown said if we only need need the intellectual conception of man we don't need the Holy Spirit if the church is to be run and governed upon the intellectuals and the educational program upon the intellectuals of mankind we do not need the Holy Spirit if it's to be run by the Holy Spirit we do not need the intellectuals it's either one or the other can you say Amen one or the other now as as we move on for just a few more moments faith faith must have a foundation to be built upon to to rest upon to to to to and there's no other foundation for Faith to rest upon outside the word of God and why why why is it that it's the word of God because scripture Jesus said the scriptures cannot be broken amen it it's it's it's just that way and he said another place all scriptures must be fulfilled so brother Brown would tell us then he says how much more Foundation could you place your faith on any level than the word of God what more could you put your faith in ain't that right we find there in Mark 13 31 Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass talking about faith now prayer of faith my word will never pass away so then that means his word is eternal ain't that right but not only is it any is it Eternal it's a promise to us and you say that with me the word of God is a promise to me the word of God is a promise see brother brannerman speaking of Abraham said that he had to lay his faith upon God's promised word yet look at it just the word but now he looked up on it as a promise God's promised word Abraham's Faith laid upon God's promised word look at what God told Simeon that he would not see death until he seen the Christ child and that old man 80 years old or so have a Gray beard gray hair and and and and all that but he went around telling everybody I will not die I will not die till I see the Lord's Christ I will not die a man why he had a confession his faith amen was so strong amen may have become a personal revelation upon the promise of God upon the promise ain't that right brother Brown said that old man had a basis for his faith the promises of God in another place he said your faith has got a foundation and that is because God promised it can you say it with me God promised it so I now I have an understanding my faith is now come to me because I have an understanding of what God has promised yeah praise the Lord not just someone reading the Bible to me it's not just me reading the Bible and once a year all the way through and say wow I've done that it's not me learning scriptures and learning how to quote them and quote quote quote amen all that but now I have an understanding that this word has promises for me [Music] oh what a prayer faith Amen brother Branham says he said the very world you're sitting on top of tonight is nothing more than the word of God materialized he spoke the word and said let there be and the world came into existence all things that you see was made by faith in the spoken word of God God said let there be and he believed his own word man he believed his own word well after Redemption notice now after Redemption and the taste of God in our souls and harm how much more we to base our faith on what God has given us the promise for and sent Jesus to die to redeem us through that promise he came to redeem us back to the promises you understand promises don't belong to me because I've got intellectual Faith about what God Said but now I have the understanding of redemption it's one thing to say well I'm going to heaven that's that's wonderful we're going to heaven but what about right now what about the promises he redeemed you too oh I'm going to heaven but I sure don't know if I could ever reach adoption what he would redeem you to eternal life and cannot put you into an adoption it shouldn't be strange to us that a man could stand in this day and speak squirrels into existence it ought to give us more faith that if he can do it something can God that same God can get a hold of my lips that same God can unction me to do something is he redeemed that Prophet to do death amen and to go back to what Adam was and call squirrels that was no squirrels into existence what can he do about my situation why he redeemed you to it he redeemed you to these promises and you say Amen so then then it's not just Faith cometh by hearing but now we're having the understanding of promises this Bible is full of promises for me can you say Amen amen we base our faith on the promise that God has redeemed us to you see we do not pray then by what we see we do not Pray by what we feel we pray by what we believe we do not pray according to our reason we pray according to what God has promised then you say Amen we pray to what God has promises I hope I hope that when you play taste I hope you do play tapes I hope you play them in your home don't ever get too busy you can't play tapes we ought to be matured enough to be able to play tapes in our home don't take your message I don't just think you're a message believer if you don't play tapes in your hole that Prophet shouldn't even be his voice shouldn't be strange to you in your home in your car wherever you are you ought to be playing them tape why they're promises these are promises that God has redeemed us to find out what God has promised for this hour God promised that in this hour the sons of God would be manifested we wouldn't even know that except the Prophet come and told us that God promised in this hour to sound the trumpet of Jubilee and those that heard the sound and believed in it and acted upon it could go free that's a promise for this hour do you believe it you don't have to be bound you can be free yes sir God promised in this hour to change our vile body from Mortal to immortality from corruption to incorruption that's the promise that God has redeemed us doing this hour God promised in this hour that if we'd speak to the mountain and doubt not what we say we shall have what we say that's a promise for this hour do you believe that well some of us do anyways do you believe that church I've redeemed you to these things you realize this is the hour of restoration of all things you love the Lord I get passionate about what I preach so you just have to bear with me I just get passionate I'm thinking if God so loved me that he would redeem that he said these promises to me and me to these promises why can I act upon them I don't know about you but the devil whips me all the time he's he's all this time trying to get in my brain he's all the time trying to bring discouragement he's all the tribe but somewhere amen I'm just going to say you know what devil I'm going to tell you a thing or two you understand what I'm saying what's wrong with me about getting excited I'm the one that's got the promises he don't he ain't got no right over my life God redeemed me to these promises so I'm not going to let him affect my prayer I'm not going to let him know affect the way I speak to God pray oh woe is me Lord I don't know have you ever found yourself doing that well I am Lord where are you I don't know that's the devil's language I'm telling off of myself brother Bill why can't I Take God at his word amen what's wrong with quoting the word what's wrong with quoting what a prophet said to the devil the devil hates this message just as much he hates that Bible but more than anything he hates it when it comes from the heart of a believer when it comes from a mouth of a Believer he hates it because the man the woman the boy girl actually believes it ain't that right so the foundation of our faith is the promises for this hour the promises come from this world so our understanding comes from this word and we understand the promises that are given to us now brother Brian said Faith holds that faith that holds the word of God yields the power of God can you say that with me faith that holds the word of God yields the power of God the power of God should not be strange to us faith that holds the word of God yields the power of God the person has the faith to hold the word of God has also the power to is the one that yields the power of God ain't that right then brother Brown said then you're persistent then you're persistent you're not going to back down off the devil you're not going to say well I don't know if I can do it I don't know if I'm doing this in vain I don't know I just you know it just seems like I'm spinning my wheels I just don't know I don't know don't know what's the use of praying what's he used to believe in what's the use of listen to Faith what's the use of going to church what's the use of that it's only in the intellectual Faith but if you could get the right Faith the hard Faith Amen to know that that God that will keep his word that God honors his word that this is the promises for me on this day you the one that will yield the power of God well I don't have any sensation I don't feel nothing it doesn't matter do you realize that it does not matter it's not Sensation that yields the power of God it's faith faith is what yields the power the man that has faith in the word of God for this hour can you say Amen brother Brown said it's the faith for this hour [Music] is the one that yields the power of God you say well I've trained speaking squirrels into existence that may not be what God's called you to do but you still have that power amen well I don't see anything happening to my child well brother Bram didn't see no squirrels either he said he sat there all day and there was no squirrels but all of a sudden something said how many squirrels do you want you understand what I'm saying Speak that same God can move upon us move upon you so what do you want look at Hattie brother Bram didn't tell her what she needed she spoke it yes sir she spoke it you love the Lord so according to the scriptures our faith isn't to stand in an intellectual explanation of the word and the Apostle Paul made sure that it didn't come that way the prophet of this hour and every Minister ought to be that way and and not only just ministers but you mothers fathers anyone that's handling the word speaking the word it should not no man's face should be built upon intellectual explanation for the Bible says the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life First Corinthians 2 and 1 and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you saved Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in much weakness and in fear and in much trembling in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and the power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God so the the genuine true gospel is the word made Power and Paul came in dense demonstration of spirit and Power why so that their faith could rest in the promised word hello now brother bear I'm talking about Paul said the greatest Theologian that ever lived said he had to forget everything that he ever knowed in order to find Christ and said I don't preach the intellectual things I preach the simpleness of the leading of the Holy Spirit see so he preached the word by demonstrating the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and so the the promised word everybody say the promised word I think that's that's that's so important to understand the promised word was demonstrated to the People by the power of God so to direct the faith of the people away from man brother Branham says in this here he says when the Holy Ghost comes and reveals the word and makes it live just exact then it's a revelation to you you see it it's unfolded it's promised for the hour aren't you glad for that God didn't send us a theologian God didn't send us an intellectual to preacher just give us an intellectual speech God sent someone that can make Christ live among us and make this word live among us to where we could see the word manifest every promise and when we see the word here and then we see it before our lives it gives us a faith it gives us a faith it's unfolded so our faith is in the promised word of the hour and and so when we as the elect recognize the word is being fulfilled then we know that God is on the scene can you say Amen how many times people thought well God's on the scene Pentecostals you know go back to that now that's where I came from and that was the most visible things if God was on the scene someone danced someone done cartwheels oh God's on the scene amen so many times it didn't have preaching because we had a we had a powerful service and everybody tuckered out by running around and dancing and shouting and all that and you know good and well I'm I'm all for all that amen but the word did not have the preeminence at all and and everybody was up and down every uh because we all went my feelings can you say man and so we thought God was among us because amen sung the fast songs and and beat the you know the piano and the drums and da da da da got that foot going you know and our pastor knew how to do that when he wanted a good service you know he knew how to do it see and then before you know it someone starts clapping and someone starts doing the doing a little dance he says Ah you got it you got it you got it you know and before you know it everything starts breaking out right well God had his way tonight he says well that's all we knew can you say man but then we realized that we recognize the word being fulfilled then we know God's Among Us God is on the scene can you say amen and notice what the Bible calls it the faith of God's elect the faith of God's elect Jesus was the light of the hour because he was the promised word of the hour and tried to tell them so but they were too much in darkness to understand it and he brother Brown said so is it today now he said you know there's something about being with Jesus that gives you an experience being around where he's at watching his work and then that gives you faith when you have experience it gives you faith faith goes by your experience now I've had experiences of of of of seeing people jump up and down and getting emotional and I've had it I've had experiences prophesying and speaking in tongues and and all these things I've had them experiences but then I found a greater experiences and that was when Christ was married made visible Among Us by the word being made known fulfilled can you say Amen no other man outside of Christ could stand up and say this day this scripture is being fulfilled as it has been in this day and no other people could look at the scripture from the Old Testament to the New Testament and stand here and say this day these scriptures are being fulfilled by us then you say Amen what does it do it gives us an understanding he gives us a faith to know that God is here brother Brown said why does God do miracles to give us an understanding the reason that God performed miracles in Egypt he was trying to get them to understand that he was God in their midst ain't that right so in closing but notice the Bible that was promised to be demonstrated to us in this last day Luke 21 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth and distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the ways roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory and when these things begin to come to pass and look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh can you say man what is it we shall see the son of man I mean what a promise and this that's been laying there dormant all these time through these years until this age but what is it it's the show to us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever our faith is not in a god of History our faith is not in a God that once was and once did and wants this and that but now our faith is in a present tense God that what he was back then he is the same today can you say man why because it's the son of man being revealed but Brian said it's the same power it's the same spirit it's the same works it's the same it's it's it's Jesus Christ the same in every aspect except the Corporal body ain't that right in every detail it's the same Messiah sign in demonstration can we say that is that not what it was in this age is that not what we saw was the Messiah sign done in this age the same sign that God used to to to to Abraham as God in flesh amen was the same sign that Jesus did God in Christ in Jesus done to the Jews and to the Samaritan woman and that same sign has been done in this today to show us that it wasn't a theologian it wasn't just a man it was God himself revealed to us and every promise is here to be fulfilled by us he's here to fulfill them he's redeemed us to these can you say Amen so what it is is giving us an understanding that God is among us so that our faith would not stand in the wisdom of men that our faith would not stand in our own feelings and our own selves in our own abilities he's here he's here can you say man you love him what we have seen in this age is the greatest demonstration that could ever be given to man why it's the sign of the resurrection of Jesus Christ it has given us a greater understanding of God than all the books that could be written it has given us some greater understanding of God than all the literary literary and all the Theology and all the seminaries and schools that could ever be this sign that has been given to us today that has shown Christ visible and showed his presence here Among Us can you say Amen Forest Jesus Christ himself being demonstrated Among Us brother Branham as we get ready to close but brother Brown said other ministers who who preached healing by the word it takes a long time to build in faith like that sometimes sometimes they say stay six eight ten weeks maybe three months because it's necessary for them to do that but up here on usual just to demonstrate to show what God has done in this way of this phenomenon it doesn't take long till the people first 15 or 20 minutes if they're spiritual minded they'll catch it right away and then things begin to happen water Ministry Amen to build our faith up he said I'm convinced that it's the gospel and the power and demonstration of the resurrection of the peering of the Lord Jesus in this last day making the church ready to be caught away in The Bride Can you say Amen so then our faith is not standing a man in in the wisdom of men's uninspired teaching uninspired ways that our faith is standing in the power of the resurrected of Christ do you believe that we have seen Christ Jesus Christ made visible here today I love the Lord do you love him I love him with all my heart amen brother Branham said this Messiah sign was greater was greater a greater challenge than walking up to a crippled woman that's in a wheelchair and telling her to rise up and walk now you think of that for a moment when we hear Brother brannerman in prayer lines begin to read them tell them what they're doing what they've done what's wrong with him and all that he said it is a greater sign to you it's a greater challenge than it would be to go to a crippled woman has been in that wheelchair and say rise and walk he said because she could actually do that through psychic power that's right mental she could do it in Christian Science Faith it's been done but when you see Christ coming to the people and do the same manifestation of the sign of Heaven giving back in fulfilling of the word what a miracle what a power can you say man if the musicians will come we have been given the greatest sign that could be given so that we could understand Christ in the power of his resurrection if our faith was to stand in the wisdom of intellectual Giants then God would have sent us an intellectual the God sent a prophet and not only that he sent a prophet that would manifest the very same sign as Jesus did amen as Melchizedek did Melchizedek did it's the greatest sign that it could ever be think of that do you love him amen if you notice brother Brown said in his ministry was a Ministry of faith to get the people to just believe just believe just believe he tells when the angel of the Lord came to him and gave him his commission he said do not fear said I'm sent from the presence of God to tell you that you were born A peculiar birth and your peculiar life has been to indicate that you're to take a gift of Divine Healing to the people of the world I said sir I'm uneducated I couldn't go he said if you just get them to believe you and if you're sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer if you'll get them to believe you and I said but I bet they wouldn't even believe me sir he said you'll be given two signs as the prophet Moses was given to signs to get the people to believe you is is the really the issue he said one of them was detecting diseases just by holding the person's right hand and your left he said then if you'll be sincere and she'll come to pass that you'll tell the very secrets of the hearts and the things that they are doing wrong to build the faith in the people to be in faith and to vindicate you that God will send it to you another place he said God knows I know not what's wrong with you not not a one but under the anointing there's no one could come to this platform but what would be told just what is wrong with them and what they were and done in their life and maybe the cause of the sickness he said now what that is for is to build the faith of the patient another place brother Branham says in the prayer line he says he told the lady said I'm trying to build your faith to a place to get the anointing on you sister see when when the faith comes when our faith comes the anointing comes upon us so that's why he said I'm trying to build faith upon you I'm trying to get you you get and build your face so the anointing will come upon you see he said I feel that I've tried to project a Divine prophetic gift to build the faith of the people instead of using What's called the gift of healing by laying hands on people now a gift of healing is to be admired by laying your hands but now a prophetic gift he says see he told me that was given me and that that would make the people believe in other words here that's him speaking back saying that I've told the truth can you say Amen so so if I could say it this way has this message built to faith in you [Music] that's a bill faith in you that's what it was all for now notice what he says you believe what I said about God is true what I said about Christ is true what about uh about the Holy Spirit is true then the angel that has come down that God has sent down in this last days to bless his people after the preaching of his word see and that those things that faith has been built by ministers through the age and then to thank his loving kindness to come down in the last days and do something else for us to send a prophetic gift that would Magnify Him before the people to get the people to see that he's just the same today as he was back then oh my I say we have an understanding faith has been built one more quote he says the only thing that condemns you is your unbelief and if we can't have faith enough to believe God for little things that we are seek that we see taking place here and then try to muddle it up all up and say it's psychology it's mental telepathy or something like that how in the world are you going in the resurrection figure that out when your body will probably be not over Spoonful Of Ashes but God will raise it up can you say man so what he's done is to get our faith in the right direction get our faith in the right things ain't that right amen not faith in doctors not faith in in in in in intellectuals not faith and what Dr so-and-so says and this one says and that one says and this says that get Faith in the right direction and that's what God Among Us in this age and that power that is here that we're believing in that we believe did create the squirrels we do believe that that it did stop that snowstorm we believe that it did give Hattie right her children that same power that we believe in is going to raise up our bodies one of these days I believe it I believe it amen praise the Lord do you love him amen what song are we singing amen sing it with me now we've got the power in the name of Jesus we've got the power in the name of the Lord though Satan Ray Egypt we will not be defeated we've got the power In The Name Of The Lord Oh sing it now we've got the power in the name of Jesus
