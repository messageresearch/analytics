his time and and preach whatever the lord has laid upon his heart and you know i guess when we come to church we're always hungry and we we want to know more of god and god knows the needs ain't that

and in truth amen well you may be seated i'm going to ask my wife to come up we may sing a song this morning if that's okay and you know i i say when we go out to preach seems like she gets more compliments on her singing than my preaching so i gotta take her with me so i get invited back so anyways so why do they leave isn't this message still the same why do they seek for something more than simplicity why do they turn turn their back on you oh lord why do they [Music] it will still be true tomorrow what i believe is not the work of any man his kingdom can be shaken on this glorious foundation while others fall here i stand i know you said there's a great falling away i know they try i'm sure of the rock i stand upon one thing i know will press on your truth is what i follow it will still be true tomorrow what i believe is work of any man his kingdom can't be shaken on this glorious foundation while others fall here i stand on christ the solid rock i stand all over the ground is sinking [Music] it will still be true his kingdom can't be shaken on this glorious foundation while others fall here i stay [Music] while others [Music] are you grateful for the message of the hour if not we'd be still stumbling in confusion amen well if you have your bibles let's turn to john 16 and 12. it's an honor to be standing here appreciate the opportunity to be speaking this morning this is like a second home and most of you all know i've spent apart two or three months of my life here so seems like every time that uh i'd be going through circumstances or trials as a young man always had a place here that i can just escape and recoup my mind you know so i always appreciate uncle sean and what he's done for me as a young man growing up you'll have a great pastor here if y'all don't know that you ought to know that john 16 and 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come can we bow our heads this morning dear heavenly father lord it's an honor and a privilege to be standing before your people this morning god as i've prepared lord for this morning i ask that you would anoint me help me to get myself out of the way lord lord just anoint this vessel god bring back to remembrance lord things i've listened lord and in your message god are things i've studied on father lord just lead me this morning anoint the hearers father as the word come forth i ask that they would reach up and accept their blessing father we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated my subject this morning or my title would be the spirit of truth these are some things that i've been studying on for myself for the last month or so so i pray it can all come together and and make sense you know that's when i want to start off by saying i'm thankful for a prophet he came in this last day with the mind of god not just to give his opinions not just to give his ideas but he came with a message to bring us a revelation of all the mysteries that were sealed up in the book and you know in this scripture here sort of having me puzzled for you shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and that sort of had me puzzled and i was wondering what did that mean you know and so brother branham speaks on the scripture in a guide he says now in this 13th verse how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth what is truth he says the word for he shall not speak of him he shall not speak of himself but what he hears he'll speak and he says it again what he hears he'll speak in other words he'll be the one that will reveal the thing and that just made sense and what i got out of that is you know we hear many say that or some say that the the spirit of truth is to divide the message and pick out truth and what this here meant to me is brother branham says he's not going to come to you and give you the revelation of the seals like he did with the branham he's not going to come and speak of himself but what he hears a prophet's going to come on the scene with the message with the revelation and the spirit of truth that's on the inside is going to hear it then he's going to reveal it and that just spoke to me saying wow the spirit of truth of this bride is under can look at this message and say it's thus saith the lord i may not understand it but there's something on the inside that is drawing me to this message something on the inside that's drawing me to this word you see human intellect can never understand the things of god never understand this message never understand scriptures they've been trying for years for centuries to try to understand scripture that's why there's the trinity doctrine there's the the baptism's off this is off that is off they're trying to understand scripture in human intellect but we don't got to try to understand scripture in our own intellect we can come under the spirit of truth and look at a vindicated message not some idea not some opinion but we got a message that was from the throne room of god to bring all the loose sins together brother branham says this message is the tie all the loose ends together he says now watch there was a lot of truth lost out there my why they were picking out what they thought was right what this one thought was right and they lost a lot of truth but he says there's a lot of truth lost out there why others when others compromised on truth but this seventh angel don't compromise on nothing and i'm so glad that we had a man of god a prophet that wasn't worried about being popular wasn't worried about fitting in but he wanted to bring a message to this bride so that she can understand her place her day in scripture in march he still continuing going on the skin this quote the seventh angel don't compromise on nothing he gathers up all the loose ends gathers them up oh my gathers them up be grateful for the message but you can't have truth without having the spirit of truth and you can't have the spirit of truth without having truth they tie together and produce an invincible army you look at john 4 and 24 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth he didn't leave no wiggle room jesus didn't say if you feel like it worship in spirit and truth he didn't say if if you think it's right he says you must there's no wiggle room you've got to have the spirit of truth and the word you've got to have the word there's many that wants to take the spirit but push away the word or have the word and push away the spirit but there's a middle road spirit and truth is what's going to produce a rapture what's going to produce your body change what's going to produce a future home oh you look at second corinthians 3 and 6 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life the letter ain't going to have nothing to produce with unless the spirit's there then the spirit can pick up the message and produce it inside of your life oh my jesus said you gotta worship in spirit and in truth and that's what's making this message live if not you're gonna go right back to denominations go right back to man's ideas man's opinions brother branham says here we are at the end time red light down flashing coming of the lord as that hand yes sir listen the end time message shall meet end time conditions where they got off the message ought to bring it back oh i'm so glad that we're not stuck in denominational ideas but where they left off where luther fell off well once they fell off we had a message to bring what wesley's truth hat what this one's truth had and bring forth the fullness of the word so that there can be a bride march over theology merch over man-made ideas merciful opinions and i'd stand with truth well the message ought to bring back always end time message meets end time conditions all the way through scripture you'll have to do it this time a call back to the original word oh my like other messengers did in that day this message will have to be the same we promised that god promised it back in his word malachi 4 said it would happen restore the faith of the children back to the fathers promised it and we're living in that day oh it's been always each time a group of leaders that gets the people all mixed up it's not so much the people it's the leaders that gets them mixed up this message didn't come to put you into confusion [Applause] but there has to be a people under the spirit of truth that can point and say no that's a lie no that's deception no that's not right if it's not coming back to scripture it's not right it's the leaders brother branham says it's this one it's that one but there's got to be a people that's under the spirit of truth that can say this is truth this message is truth while others fall while this one's falling away i'm standing on truth you see where they got off to the church ages this message is to bring back brother branham says they're probed have the word throughout the church ages and that's why it got all mixed up but this message is to bring the fullness of the word back to us but this only comes the understanding of this only comes by the holy ghost he didn't say i'm going to send some holy men and they're gonna make seminaries he says i'm gonna send the spirit of truth he didn't say i'm gonna give you some intellect where you can understand the scriptures he says i'm gonna give you the spirit of truth he promised to send a guide he promised to send something to lead us brother branham says jesus first doctrine was she must be born again and he says if there's 900 denominations there's going to be 900 different meanings of what that means he says there's one meaning you must be born again it's an experience he says some say you gotta quote a creed or some say you gotta belong to church to be born again he says no it's an experience and that's where many people is missing is the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost that's why they're putting their own ideas to the message they're putting their own opinions to the message if they can't understand it they're trying to bring it together with their human intellect but the spirit of truth is to guide you into all truth no matter how smart you are how intelligent you are you'll never be able to understand scriptures it's always been the smart ones that explain away the bible that explain away a god explain away this why they can't comprehend it with this human mind it's gotta be by the spirit of truth guiding us amen brother branham says in the scriptures it's of no private interpretation it was wrote by the holy spirit and the holy spirit is the only one who can reveal it from it is hid from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and revealed to babes such as will lord so if you don't watch if you don't use the mind of the holy spirit to put it together you have your scene all mixed up he says for instance like a cow picking grass in the top of a tree that's just about the way it looks that's what man's theology looks like without the spirit of truth a cow on top of a tree eating grass it's impossible for that to happen just like it's impossible for there to be three gods just like it's impossible for you to be sprinkled just like it's impossible for this and for that without the spirit of truth your theology is going to get it all mixed up and the same thing is happening in the message oh you don't have to have the holy ghost anymore we don't need an experience anymore what the theology is doing is putting a cow up in a tree eating grass but there's a pride that's under the spirit of truth not with man's theology but with thus say of the lord with the message that is coming right back to scripture that is properly vindicated for this last day oh my hallelujah this message will always go right back to scriptures the scripture was wrote by the holy spirit and the only way it's going to be revealed is by the holy ghost brother branham says without the holy ghost you can't put the pieces together he says it's like it's like a jigsaw puzzle and without the spirit of truth you can't put the pieces together have you ever put a puzzle together and you have a piece that you think goes here it looks right and you're cramming it in there cramming it in there you're putting a plate a piece that don't belong there but it belongs over there oh man that's what happens with men's theology without the holy ghost they're trying to cram a piece that don't belong there but stick with this message all of the pieces will come together and produce an invincible army produce a rapture stick with this message oh there's only one way to understand scriptures that's through the holy ghost john 14 and 15 if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever he says even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because that saith him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you he says if you love me keep my commandments but he knew this was going to be impossible to keep the scriptures to understand the scriptures so he stops and he says i'm going to give you a guide i'm going to give you the spirit of truth so that you can make scriptures live but the world can't receive it because they don't know what it is they think an emotion is the holy ghost come on somebody they're in confusion but we had a message that says speaking in tongues it's a holy ghost it's an experience that's why we needed a message so that the spirit of truth can come inside of this bride so that we can recognize the day we're living according to this message oh my in your own ability you can't keep my words you can't keep my commandments but i'm going to send the guide and i'm so glad that we've got a guide in this last day and the holy ghost will never leave you astray from the word it always comes right back to the word brother branham says the holy ghost is your compass and the word is the north star the holy ghost can only point to that north star and if your wonder a guide that's pointing somewhere other than scripture you're under the wrong died but if you're under the spirit of truth and it's pointing back to scripture you can stand assured that you're under the spirit of truth and there's no deception that can get your mind there's no ideas that can get your mind but just stick with the spirit of truth oh hallelujah you say if we have the holy ghost then why do we need a prophet this is the point many people use hopelessness okay uncle sean this is the point many people use to disregard the message we got the spirit of truth so we don't need a prophet the spirit of truth is to divide the message and pick out truth that's not the way jesus said it would be he says he's going to guide you he's not going to pick out truth for you he's going to guide you in truth oh they've got their chain all mixed up they got a cow up in a tree eating grass the holy ghost need to divide the message the holy ghost is to be guided you into the message so that you can see the day that you're living in we have too many people with a head knowledge and missing the spirit of truth we needed a message because we needed something to tie the loose ends together the holy ghost ain't going to come to you like i said earlier and give you a mouth sunset experience where you're called up by seven angels and he's going to give you the revelation no he gave a prophet a revelation and you're to see this message and not argue with this message not put your own ideas to this message not put your interpretations to this message but be led and guided into this message by the spirit of truth oh you see the two go hand in hand you've got to have the truth and you've got to have spirit of truth hope this is all making sense this morning oh they're they're there's big-name preachers i used to be big-name preachers in the message let's start to divide the message from the bible and what that does is takes you back to confusion claiming to be under the spirit of truth and start to divide the message from the bible you can't divide the message from the bible the message didn't do away with the bible it came with an interpretation of the bible why did we need a message because man's ideas got the bible all twisted up oh my feet didn't need a prophet the water baptism who was ripe to be to be sprinkled with or if we didn't need a prophet the trinity's right but god gave us a prophet to bring us back to the original not for you to argue with not for you to put your own opinions with but he gave you a message to be led into oh hallelujah i hope this is okay they say the message in my absolute the bible's my absolute oh this is okay the message ain't my absolute the bible's my absolute how can you understand bible without message so the bible is not your absolute your opinions of the bible is your absolute your ideas of this bible is your absolute but we are the prophet with the divine interpretation of scriptures so that you don't go to go back to man's ideas this message came to do away with man's interpretations do away with man's idea and give us an original hallelujah that's what malachi 4 came to do to give god's interpretation not man's interpretation man's interpretation is why we're all confused in the first place but god's interpretation brought us out of confusion it's now their responsibility to correct the prophet it's now their responsibility to find the line between brother branham's human side and the spiritual side hope this is okay this morning the devil knows if you go back to confusion you're just worse off like the denominations are once you start to separate it all you're doing is looking for flaws the devil's always going to give you flaws always going to give you reasons to leave this message but god gives you a reason he vindicated this message by the purifier by his spirit many times it's been vindicated so this bride can look and say this is the message i'm to be under oh and it's a trick of the devil to drive a wedge between the scriptures and the interpretation of scriptures you look at revelations revelations is a book of symbols how can you understand it without an interpretation of it you see this message and the bible come together hope this is making sense this morning it's coming together and they look they look for the mistakes and the devil is always going to give you mistakes remember what happened with moses the dathans and the chorus rose up and started to divide moses's message from the scripture you're not the only holy man that god speaks to god speaks to us too and they started to divide the what happened there was many that fell away what happened to the men and women that was with nathan and corey after they went into confusion the earth swallowed them up the world swallowed them up what happens oh what happens whenever confusion sets in the world's gonna try to grab you you look at some of these that left a message their daughters are lesbians they're now drinking beer their wives are wearing pants and cutting their hair confusion is going to lead you straight to the world but a vindicated message will lead you straight to a rapture straight to a body change straight to your future home don't go to man's ideas of this message stick with the save the lord stick with the vindicated prophets oh hallelujah most of this message did them no good if there was no one to believe it somebody had to believe that message in order to go into the promised land somebody's got to believe this message though everyone's fallen away there was a joshua and caleb that the same message oh my the same message that they were doubting brought joshua and caleb out of confusion [Music] come on somebody the same message in this day that this one's doubting this one's doubting it's bringing me out of confusion i'm no longer in the wilderness i'm in my promised land and dwelling with my inheritance oh in this morning church you don't got to go to man's confusion this message came to bring you out of it and give you your promise give you your inheritance what is my promise brother josh your healing your salvation the holy ghost your rapture your body change that's your inheritance stick with this message and every promise that god has given in this last day will be fulfilled inside of your life stick with this message oh i let them fall away let them do their own thing that is from me and my house i'm gonna stay with this message i'm gonna stay with the vindicated prophet hallelujah you see the thing of that back back in that day they couldn't look past the veil of flesh they couldn't look past the flesh and see a message that moses had oh hallelujah what's happening today hope this is okay they can't look past the flesh and see a message oh but the brandon made human mistakes but the brandon had false moses killed a man but that message that moses brought wasn't from a human intellect it was from the throne room of god and the message that malachi before brought through william miriam branham was in his intellect it was from the throne room of gods oh how come they killed jeremiah they killed isaiah they killed the great prophets they couldn't look past the veil of flesh and the same thing today they're trying to kill brother brown but the brandon says you don't got to stab a man in the back to kill him you can kill his influence and what are they trying to do come on somebody trying to kill the influence of the message on your life but there's somebody that's under the spirit of truth that's not being bound to the influence of this world their wonder another influence the spirit of truth is guiding you away from confusion and into a message oh come on somebody this message has brought us out of confusion [Applause] ii peter 1 and 20 knowing this that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not an old time i like this not in old time by the will of man hey he didn't come by the will of man scripture says but by holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost what's the absolute they're saying the bible not the message how did the bible come about flawed human beings flawed human beings they're absolute come on somebody but it wasn't a flawed human beings intellect it was the spirit of truth that anointed them to bring forth an absolute the bible is my absolute that's why i can say this message is my absolute and the same spirit that anointed jeremiah anointed david anointed solomon anointed jeremiah anointed joe malachi all of these ones is the same spirit that anointed malachi 4 william miriam branham to bring forth a message he anointed another flawed human being to bring forth the interpretation of truth oh just like mary was a flawed human being but she was anointed to take truth and produce it there's a bride on earth that's a flawed human being but she's anointed by the spirit of truth and is picking up truth and making it live god as an electric group a predestinated bride to come under this message and defeat theology defeat man's ideas and one day we're going to defy gravity and defeat death defeat the grave defeat hell and step out of this earthly dimension into a body change how come brother josh the spirit of truth and truth is doing something through this body and i'm going to defy the odds and step in my body change are you going with me this morning if you want to stick with this message don't look to this one's idea this one's theology stick with the vindicated prophet oh hallelujah somebody's got to believe it [Applause] somebody's got to believe it brother branham says now we're in the evening time and the messengers down to the age we find out that at the beginning when a messenger was sent to misconstrue his word or to doubt one word one word to doubt one word was a total annihilation and eternal separation from god to misconstrue that messenger's word the first messenger was god himself so i if god the first messenger was god himself and adam and eve and eve still uh took the devil's interpretation over god's word i don't think it's human flaws that's causing meaning to walk away from this message it's the same devil that spoke to eve to have her disbelief god's word god didn't come through a flawed human being in the beginning god himself came oh come on somebody well what happens is the devil is getting people to think they're so spiritual that they know more than the prophet but in reality it's the same devil that spoke to eve is speaking lies in this last day oh but there's a bride that's not under the serpents that are under the devil's lie but it's under the spirit of truth brother branham says the second eve ain't like the first eve we're not bound off all we're bound to rise how come we've had a message in this last day and the spirit of truth is making it live and the first messenger was god himself and every other messenger has been god speaking through man oh since which is god's word for there's no man then for him to speak through but just the one he's talking to there's only one man god's going to speak through that's the prophet there's not holy men that's to correct the prophet and want to follow their theology there's one man god's going to speak through that's a vindicated prophet oh hallelujah but the brandon says in another quote we are now ready for battle the trumpet is the sound the hymns have been sung now comes the word i think as i stand here yes you probably do but to hear these comments of these young soldiers here and myself getting old and listening and listening around your faith and confidence that you've placed to believe this message that god has been that god has given now if it wasn't for you all this message would do no good it says if there wasn't for you to believe this message he would do no good he said see it's got to be built somebody to believe it why do you think the devil's coming and trying to get you to doubt this message if somebody ain't going to believe it it's not going to do no good oh but the devil may try he may send theology but there's a bride under the spirit of truth [Applause] hold on he says as long as it's coming from god there's going to be somebody believe it and i believe this message came from god and i'm going to be the somebody that's going to believe it he's just he says you see god has made a way he have fixed this great economy so when he sends for something there's going to be something meet that something the deep response to the call of the deep what does brother branham say in the church age book he says the devil knows he can't make you one of his children paraphrasing he says he knows he can't make you one of his but what he does is to discredit the word in your life what does that happen that's putting question marks in your mind and concerning this message he knows you're not his seed he knows you're not one of his but if he can get you to disbelieve this message oh you see what the devil's trying to do he's trying to take you right back to confusion right back to the wilderness brother branham says the children of israel was only right there on the border of the promised land they were right there but because of disbelief they wandered around in confusion [Applause] and what happened they wanted to go back where they came from they said let us make us a captain what was the captain a captain was what beat their backs in egypt come on somebody it was a captain that kept them in bondage and because of confusion that theology wanted to take them back to where they came from but sean you came out of pentecost you came out of manmade ideas why would you want to go back to that captain oh why would we want to go back to that cabin when we're on the verge of a rapture a verge of our body change the verge of my future hope i've walked through the red sea i've watched by the egyptians be defeated why would i want to go back i'm going to stick with the message this may be a boat statement but i believe anything outside of this message is confusion anything outside of this message is confusion and whenever you separate the message from the bible you're starting to denominate oh hallelujah you're starting to denominate how come what happened with wesley's then wesley's day they took a portion of truth and pushed the rest away brother branham says the baptists have a portion of truth this one has a portion of truth but they're pushing the rest away whenever you start to separate the message from the bible you're taking a portion of truth and pushing the rest away which is making a denomination then when that happens you're no longer in the message because brother branham says this message will never denominate there's somebody that's not putting their own ideas but sticking with the pure unadulterated word of god oh hallelujah hope this is okay brother branham says she with their own interpretation they couldn't do nothing else because they leaned to what their church i told them he always comes then he did rather he would heal every time he comes everything he does it'll be a taste of the word so therefore we can't put confidence in what other people say there's only one thing you can put your confidence in and that's the word and the word is god and the anointed makes the messiah the anointed word of the hour how beautiful they missed it the word the word is always right but their interpretation is always wrong that's not that the bible's wrong but the baptist interpretation of scripture is wrong the methodist interpretation of scripture is wrong it's not it's not that the message is wrong man's interpretation of this message is wrong we've seen uh somebody sent us the website back home of a group in texas saying that brother branham was lord he's jesus christ someone's gonna see that and say man that message is wrong they're occult no the message ain't wrong that man's interpretation is wrong oh stick with the prophet stick with the message and you'll never have to be going back to man's ideas brother branham says god he don't eject anything into all he says when a man is born of the spirit of god he don't inject anything into his life it's the unadulterated word of god vindicated for this hour oh my this message is pretty important when a man is born of the spirit of truth he puts inside of his life the vindicated word for this hour oh there's a bride that's making this word live he takes the full word of god he don't put no creeds nothing else into it it's purely unadulterated god's word made manifest among us made manifest the word hasn't been made manifested until this last day because it was all uh misconstrued it was all mixed up so there was no power to make the world live oh but there's a bride just like when jesus was on earth making scripture live why did he say to the scribes and pharisees search the scriptures for they testify of me brother branham says that jesus life vindicated who he was because of scripture this message is vindicated because the scripture this pride is vindicated because of scripture and now the word is walking on earth once again oh my goodness you missed jesus christ how come this word has brought christ down the appearing brother random says the appearing and the coming of christ is two different things we've got the appearing in word form the message has brought christ and one day if you stick with this message we'll see the coming oh my there's going to be some missing they're not going to see the rapture but there's a bride that's going to see it because they're sticking with the appearing of jesus christ oh hallelujah hallelujah and brother branham says remember he is a true prophet of god hope it's okay to read quotes this morning who the word comes to he can't do nothing else but go back to the words a prophet can do nothing else but go back to the word there's many accusing brother branham that his teachings was off so bless saying he's a false prophet because the prophet can't do nothing but go back to the words no matter if all the pentecostals in the country gather around him and say sir amos we believe you to be a prophet but you're off the word we want to straighten you up he would stay with the word there's nothing else he can go to he could go to because he's a prophet he didn't need the cooperation oh he didn't need the cooperation he's got a message to give all the father has given me will come to me he's going to preach the word he's going to preach it just like would be in the bible you catch that the prophet is going to preach his message just like it's in the bible how come it's in the bible he's preaching a message with conviction just like he would be preaching the bible because the message came out of the bible hallelujah just like would be in the bible therefore we'll turn him down that's right no matter what it would be the word of god comes to the prophets their interpretation catch this part we'll read it again no matter what would be the word of god comes to the prophets their interpretation of the word is the right interpretation oh no need to put your ideas to it the prophet's interpretation is the right interpretation but brother branham says the way of a true prophet is always despised people can never look past the veil of flesh never look past his mistakes and see the message that he didn't bring with his intellect but a message that god gave and many to many times people is making themselves the interpreter of the message we don't need an interpreter of the message we got an interpretation and brother branham says have you have you ever thought how great this is what could you give in exchange in this day of confusion says this day when the people don't know what to do which way to go the bible says these days would come and there would be a famine in the land not for bread not for water but for the hearing of the true word of god i like how he says that the true word of god not a man's idea of the word of god but the true word of god and the people would go from east to west north to south seeking to hear the true word of god they're seeking for something they're looking for something it's already here brother branham says and here we are privileged tonight to see the message he says they're going from north to south he's the west seeking for the true word of god and he says you're privileged to see the true word of god how come this message has brought forth the true word of god oh the world is looking for something genuine people in this message is looking for something but it's already here remember when the scribes and the pharisees asked jesus for a sign they were looking for a vindication they asked give us a sign and what did jesus say he says a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign he didn't say nothing about the elect peter had already seen the word come on somebody the the elective that day had already seen the words vindicated they didn't need a sign they stopped looking they found something come on somebody the unbelievers were still looking for something and failed to see what they were looking for was in their midst oh and let the people in the message turn away they're still looking for something but i found what i was looking for malachi 4 came on the scene i'm no long i'm no longer looking for the bride's revival it's here in action i'm not looking i'm not looking for the manifestation of the third pole it's already here i'm not looking for an adoption message it's already here stop looking and enjoy the fulfillment come on somebody we need to stop looking and enjoy it if i was looking for my hanky but i thought it was in the office and it's right here i'm gonna push that away and go around here looking for something that's right here when you're looking for something you're pushing it off in the future because it's not here in a present tense form and whenever you're looking for something to come you're going to miss out what's already here oh hallelujah the scribes and the pharisees were pushing it off for something to come you can't push it off for something to come the message has brought it the seals have been open we don't got to wait for brother branham to come back it's already open hallelujah i hope this is okay this morning remember the woman at the whale she was looking for the messiah she was pushing it off in the future she met with christ and what does she say when the messiah comes he will do these things he she was still looking for something to come but then spirit and truth came together oh what did jesus say they that worship must worship in spirit and in truth then all of a sudden something clicked you're him she dropped her water pots oh i'm gonna i don't know if i said this here before but this hit me whenever i was studying one time she dropped her water pots what was her water pots that was her theology whenever jesus said i will give you water to drink and you will never thirst again what does she say she don't got nothing to dip with she don't got no water pots her water pots was her theology that's what was keeping her from seeing the anointed word but one of the bibles say she dropped her water parts she dropped her theology and ran away from her theology with the anointed word and said come see a man she dropped what was hindering her man's interpretation of scripture she dropped it and says i'm no longer looking for something i found it come see a man and that message or the anointed word so transformed her life that she was completely different but the brandon says since her she was ill-famed she couldn't even go into the city the men of the minimum city wouldn't even listen to her but because of the anointed word the men looked and said something's different about this woman the message has so changed our life that's made us different than the denominations man manis different than the creeds and the traditions what is it it's the power of god we're no longer deceived we've found what we're looking for we're found what we're looking for the woman at the well found what she was looking for peter found what he was looking for these other ones found what they were looking for and they stopped searching the scribes and the smart ones can keep searching if they want to with this pride has found what she is looking for we're no longer waiting for malachi 4. it's here brother branham says they want a great awakening they're crying believing that there will be awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride they're looking for something to come but it's already here say being a christian they can feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's why it's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen excuse me they know something is supposed to happen they're looking for a way off in the future to come when it's already right here by you that was way back then in 64. people were looking for something here we are in 2022 and they're still looking for something but this bratty looking she's enjoying the fulfillment of scripture hallelujah we've exchanged our confusion for the true interpretation this day this scripture is fulfilled malachi 4 is fulfilled is that all these things have come to pass you see so why do we need a prophet if we have the spirit of truth the bible did a promise to give you oh that that that i would do nothing unless i first reveal it to my bride by the spirit of truth he says i do nothing first i revealed to my prophets he didn't say i'm going to send the spirit of truth to the bride and he's going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers he says i want to send malachi 4. come on somebody he didn't say these things but he said to send a prophet and there's going to be the spirit of truth inside of a bride recognize the message for this day and act upon opponent act upon brother branham says where he preaches those messages i believe in receiving and acting upon hearing receiving and acting he says the word puts you into action once you hear it you receive it then you act upon it you're no longer looking for something but we're acting upon this message this message has produced a powerhouse inside of this pride there's now young people that can live above adultery live above pornography live above drinking and alcohol and smoking how come the message has brought the full word the full power back inside of the bride you see it's not all on the prophet the prophet's important but this bride's important too there's got to be somebody under the spirit of truth recognize hallelujah recognize and be led into it hallelujah i'm going to read this quote hope it's okay uncle sean and then brother branham says and then i heard this the other day when i when i sort of got into a little discussion with the pastor so that's how i've been studying on these things and i heard this and it it just made perfect sense to me but the brandon says and then the next message that opened up the seven seals would shut down all the hidden mysteries of the bible doctrines and so forth which the world so rudely attacks now they're still attacking it today attacks it and says it's wrong this is wrong and that here the other day in arizona splicing tapes together to make me say things that i didn't say just remember the vision about arizona proposition the bible said it was far better for you to have a rock at your neck and another thing the whosoever let him be a preacher or what he will will take one word from it or add one word to it this scripture was in in the bible concerning the scripture if you add or take away you're going to get your name taken away brother branham is using that scripture for this message why this message is the bride's absolute how come the message and the bible tie together [Applause] hallelujah he's swerving be a preacher or what he will will take one word from it or add one word to it people putting their own interpretation upon the word as it's been given trying to make it say something i didn't say then he says not my word it's his words then he says it again you shall add or take away this message is important you better not be putting your own ideas to it it's not brother branham's word it's his word and that right there you know i was told there's no quotes that says this message is the absolute and i found this one i said right here pretty much explains it to me that this message is to be the bride's absolute it's not his word it's god's word hallelujah so whenever you start this helpful this is okay when you separate the message from the bible you're separating the power of scriptures from your life separating the interpretation from the bible and brother branham didn't bring us on human intellect like i said but god has given a message that has brought the true interpretation we're no longer bound to man's teachings a man's ideas but we're bound to scripture bound to a message and one day it's going to go right back what did jesus say not one word or one of the scriptures saying not one word is going to return unto him void so in other words the word once it fulfills what it's to do is going to go back to it go back to him so if we're tied to the word are you catching me now if we're tied to the word remember brother branham says an absolute is a thai post so if we're tied to this word when this word fulfills what it's meant to do it's going to go back and if we're tied to it we're going back with it we don't got to be tied to man's ideas tied to the word hallelujah but the brandon says this message from scripture interprets to you the hour we're living in oh my interprets to you the hour we're living in brother branham says somebody wrote me here not long ago and said brother branham i'll tell you we all believe you to be a prophet said as long as the spirit of the lord's upon you and you're discerning the people and things like that the discernment we know that's a prophet but he says your teaching is horrible you know what his response was why brother you don't even know what a prophet means we hear the same thing today oh he's a prophet of god but when it comes to this his teachings off they don't even know what a prophet is he says why brother you don't even know what a prophet means what did the word of the lord come to the prophet what does the prophet mean it's all it doesn't all together mean a foresee or a foreteller a prophet means that this is given to him to vindicate that he's an interpreter of the divine word absolutely how can you be so dogmatic he says how can you be so dogmatic it shows your carnal when you do that oh i'm not a carnal one i'm a believer that's looking at this message and say i know what a prophet is and he's brought to me an interpretation [Applause] another quote like like i said i've been just putting quotes together and things for myself and here's another quote but brandon says i saw seven angels come didn't a life magazine pack it as the fog of it floated across here 27 miles high 30 miles across it's not fred saltman these others dean norman and them sitting back there stood right there when them seven angels appeared right there on the hill it shook the hills from miles around like that there stood seven angels thrown a sword in my hand and said go home open the seven seals that are given i mean it may get rocky here but i'm going to finish this this is a vindicated prophet he says here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce the serpent seed and all of these things that's been fussed about he didn't stop there he says it's thus saith the lord they're still fussing about it why would you want to fuss with us saith the lord i may be young and naive but i'm smart enough to stick with us saith the lord [Music] hallelujah why would we want to take man's interpretation when we have to say of the lord moses message was vindicated by the pillar of fire which was the spirit of truth the scriptures what did the one of the the the pillar of fire say to him out of the burning bush says i've heard the groans in my people the cries of my people and i've come to deliver them which was a scriptural promise so there's three things here there was the spirit of truth the holy ghost which was the pillar of fire scripture he says i've come to deliver my people then he gave a message which lined up with scripture then the spirit of truth vindicated it what did we get in this last day the spirit of truth the purifier the scriptures and we got a message the scriptures and the the message tied together then the pillar of fire vindicates it oh hallelujah and if they just stuck up that message they would have went across the red sea like they did they were destroyed there was army they would have went into the promised land but they couldn't stick with the message oh hallelujah the same thing today just stick with the message they might not have seen the promised land yet but if they would have stuck with the message by revelation there was already there they could see it the message brought to them their promise you look at eliezer message to rebecca was isaac she hadn't seen isaac yet she hadn't seen by a message drawn her out what about the scripture says that the mother and the brother said let her stay i believe seven more days i think brother branham says the mother represents the catholic church and he says the brother represents the preacher that's trying to get you to stay in confusion the preacher in the catholic church is trying to keep you down but what did they say ask her she's of age ask her then what did she say i'll go with him she seen a message that said no the roman catholic system has no part of me the protestant church has no part in me since they're going back to the horse system but there's a message that's drawing my name and she hadn't seen isaac yet but the message described eyes a tour what's his likes what's his dislikes what is he like and that message would describe to her what isaac was so before she seen isaac with her physical eyes she had already seen him with the revelation and one day that message brought forth isaac in front of her physical eyes we may not see christ with her physical lies but this message has brought forth a revelation that we can see christ in one day this message is going to bring us to christ so that we can see him with our physical lies remember esther esther out a message i'm gonna i'm gonna make another point right quick uh ellie geezer didn't just come and say well i think this is what he likes he was already with isaac he came before he ever came to whereas or rebecca was he was already with isaac oh a prophet went behind the curtain of time and came back and said i seen you there he was caught up and gave a message before he came with the message god had already met with him he had already been with god so he wasn't bringing his own ideas he was already there and he came and brought forth the message oh you look at the eunuch with esther esther she didn't know she never met the king before she didn't know what he liked what he what his dislikes were but there was somebody that came with the message that said i came from the throne room of the king i know what he likes i know what he wants all of the other ones oh my he didn't come to choose all the other ones he came for a chosen one there's many denominations oh my but he's not coming after the nominations he's coming after a bride that's heart after his heart flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit hallelujah and she just had to stick with the message of the you and a cat and what happened whenever she got before the king the king was wow send the others away i don't even want to see them this is one that is heartbeat of my heartbeat how come there was a message that brought her cry brought her the king just like our message has brought forth us the king and when we step before him it's heart of his heart flesh of his flesh hallelujah hope this is okay this morning i'm going to try to make one more point before i close if i can find it here the message i believe the message in the bible like i've said come together and the spirit of truth vindicates it amen what happened with mary the man when the angel of the lord came to mary i'm going to read some scriptures here when the angel of the lord came to mary that message was always pointing to scripture so so just follow me this morning you look at luke 1 26 this is when the when gabriel came to uh to mary in the sixth month of the angel gabriel was sent from god from god he wasn't he didn't send himself but this angel was sent from god into the city of galilee named nazareth just like we had an angel sent from god to laodicea but this message didn't come to any mary it came to an elected mary this message didn't come to anybody it came to an elected bride the 27th verse to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary so let's go to zechariah 13 1. in the day there shall be a fountain open to the house of david to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanliness so we see here his message is already going back to scripture back to luke luke 1 28 and the angel came unto her and said hell thou art high highly favored the lord is with thee blessed are thou among women when she saw him she was troubled at a saying and cast her in mind in her mind what matter of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son in his name they call his name jesus isaiah 9 and 6 for unto us a child is born unto us the son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace isaiah 7 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel you see his message and scripture is tying together oh look back that luke luke 1 32 and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord shall give unto him the throne of his father david isaiah 9 7 of the increase of his government and peace shall there be no end upon the throne of david his message is constantly going back luke 1 33 he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and his kingdom there shall be no end daniel 7 and 14 and there was given him dominion and glory and the kingdom that all peoples nations and sign languages shall serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion back to luke 1 34 then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing that i know a man she's saying i have no power to make scripture be fulfilled i've got no power to make the message produce itself the one of the angels say luke 1 35 or the angel said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon you the spirit of truth is going to come down and make scriptures and the message which are together make it live the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing which is born of thee shall be called the son of god because the musicians come you see there there was three things the scriptures the message they tied together then the holy ghost which was to come upon mary was to overshadow her was to bring forth the fulfillment and in this last day we've got the scriptures and the message which tie together then the spirit of truth is bringing it to life and fulfilling what scripture says will be fulfilled producing an invincible army program and it's going to produce a rapture of body change let's bow our heads this morning can you just play something soft dear heavenly father lord i hope all this came together but lord may we leave this place and know the importance of this message lord not to separate it from the scriptures god but it ties together and lord one day we're going to step out of this dimension and step into our body change lord i ask that we remain faithful to your word father may we never go to the left or to the right to this idea or to this opinion lord but may we stick true to the message you've given us that we ask these things in your precious name amen can we sing that song can't you see why i'm happy can we all stand and sing this [Music] um [Music] by the prophets i'm happy um can we sing that again i'm so happy i've accepted [Music] oh my did you enjoy it this morning amen
