of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to what to my word and the word of the lord came unto him saying get the hands and turn the eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zeropath which belongs to belongeth to zydon and and dwell there be behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarepath and went and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink and she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold i'm gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake what what somebody say first hallelujah and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the lord god of israel the bureau of mill shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the saint of elijah and she and he in her house did eat many days and the barrel of mill wasted not neither did the crews of

luke chapter four brother sean said that we had not to worry about time so we're gonna take our time this evening the book of luke chapter 4 you love reading the word of god how many really love reading the word of god are you just saying harry hear me out brother and start preaching so we're going to read the word of god tonight luke chapter 4 and let's start at verse 16. and the bible says and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty to them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord can somebody say acceptable and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness and wandered at the gracious somebody said gracious and the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and just for my brother tonight i took the liberty to make the definition of gracious for you for brother reuben that word gracious means joy the word gracious means pleasure the word gracious means to delight it means charm it means loveliness good will and kindness no doubt when god speaks it's gracious words that go out [Applause] hallelujah and all that bear witness and wonder that the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph's son wait a minute those are good words that's good preaching isn't that joseph's son don't we we know him that's just a man [Music] isn't that a little bit like today they hear the gracious words they're good words and then they stand back and say isn't that just a man and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when the great famine somebody say famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was elijah said save unto sarah pat a city of zion unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in israel in the time of elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian and all they that are in the synagogue when they heard these words they were filled with happiness they heard these words and they were filled with love they heard the gracious word and they were filled with joy [Music] and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things they were filled with wrath and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill where on their city was built but they might cast him down headlong but he passing through the midst of them went his way can we say amen to the reading of the word now i started off this evening by saying you know my my mom and my dad are here tonight and praise god for good parents how many have good parents here tonight you have good parents say hallelujah praise god for good parents and i had a good daddy and you know ever since before i could even walk my daddy always took me out and one of the things that we did together was go hunting how many are hunters here this evening then maybe you'll be able to relate a little bit this evening forgive me if i'm taking long but i want to build upon something and so when we were young he would take me out even before i could walk and as soon as i could walk i carried a bb gun out there and you know i carried a bb gun and then before you know it i was getting older and i was carrying a 22. and i was carrying a 22 and before you know it i started to carry a 30 out of 6. see the boys are happier about this than you guys and i was carrying a 30 out of six they're getting bigger right and then before you know it i put the 30 out of 6 down and i got a 300 weather bee yes sir and i like the bow hunt and we started out with just a slingshot and then we got a little bit bigger and we got a recurve and then we got a we got a fred bear and then that bow had all kinds of wheels on it right and you could never tune it but you had a cow pound bow and then they got a martin bow and then we we got what else we got uh uh one of those uh ones that's real quiet like a matthews and then we upgraded i bought my wife ahoy and we hunted anything that that would want with rabbits and squirrels and whatever that it would be but one of the things that i really like to hunt was elk because when you hunt an elf there's a way that you could speak and it'll speak back to you it's called speaking the language and you learn and back in the day we didn't have youtube in all these videos but we had cassettes where you'd get this little thing made by carlton and you'd blow on it and they would make a cow call and you listen to the tape and you'd hear and you say well this is the way that it should sound and you try to imitate it right you say i can't do this and you try your best so back in that day i decided i'd been married for a while and my wife i said i kept asking her let's go hunting with me and she would say no i have no desire to hunt and i said let's go hunting with me and she says one of these days she said i will go hunting with you because maybe i'll help because you never bring home anything so i took her hunting out for the first time and we get up early one morning and we're walking down a ridge and as we're walking down the ridge it's a nice brisk morning it's real quiet you know how it gets and you can hear everything so as we're walking i'm turning around and she said what i said you got to be quiet you got to real just they'll hear you so she's there like so we're walking along the ridge and we're making this little thing a cow call and so you blow it and and it kind of goes and you stop and you listen and you don't hear nothing so you keep walking a few more steps and she's like what are you doing and you walk a little bit and one time and way out in the distance brother we heard and she said i said did you hear that she said so i said come on come on so we're walking no meow and way out in the distance i said okay well we kept doing it it kept getting closer and finally got mirror and it and i just stopped and stood up and said what's wrong i said oh man she said what's wrong and i said well can't you hear that she says what do you mean i said that's the worst imitation of an elk i've ever heard in my life she said what does that mean i said it's another hunter we're calling in another hunter [Applause] so i'm i'm just standing there she says are you sure you better be sure and i said all right so i said we we came we sat on a big rock and i'm just sitting there she says you you you might want to get ready i said babe i already told you it's another hunter so i'm just sitting there on the rock and she's sitting there and before you know it i'm looking down the the hill and all of a sudden here comes a big old rack and it's a big old elk big old bull coming up the hill so fast that i had no time to move and before you know it it's about from right where that brother is right there just stopped and he's looking right at me and i'm standing there with my bow tech not ready and he's just looking at me and he's looking at him and i'm not moving nothing and he's just he's just salivating and looking and before you know it i said i gotta do something so he's kind of like so i try real quick to bring my bow over and by that time he's gone he had no time to move he's gonna have to look back to my wife [Laughter] she's like what happened but he was right there did you see him no i saw him but what happened why did you get him i wasn't ready here i was speaking the language he was calling i was answering and at some point something got into my head and said it's just a man [Applause] and that's what's happening today they're missing their visitation how do you know there's somebody got in their heads he is just a man [Applause] so we call and we call we're at the altar we're in church and then he shows up and we're not ready [Applause] isn't that what you're doing here tonight you're calling for the lord lord come on the sea lord i have needs and then when he comes don't put him in a corner [Applause] [Music] church i missed it right in front of my family that's what's taking place today they're calling out saying oh no don't worry he's just a man and their children are looking at him right now we got to be careful for our families we've got to know that we know not just for us for our families notice what brother branham says he says oh he says what a statement he says how direct was it when jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled oh what a statement that was [Applause] he said oh he said what a statement it was to the teachers somebody say teachers yes thank you brother and to the people that were present says that he could make this plane to the people this day is this scripture fulfilled notice he said brother brahma says for he was the messiah yet they didn't believe right here he was amen the anointed one for the hour bit of his ministry listen to this all the way up from his birth from his birth he had proved to be what he was and yet they could not believe [Applause] come on come on hallelujah oh what a statement oh but he could say today brother brown said and then he said if the person opened up their eyes they could have known knowing what day they were living in church we need to know what day we're living in we've got a vindication all the way from birth [Applause] yet there's people calling and calling in when he comes they say it's just anon that's good come on not exactly right yes notice he says no that the day they were living in for that was his hour for he was right there doing exactly what the scriptures and all the prophets had said happened in that day here he was doing exactly what god had prophesied would happen how did they miss seeing it he asked how it was right there in front of him those teachers those wise men of that day they were the ones that were calling they were waiting for him and when he showed up they missed their visitation because they can only see this flesh tonight let this little brown man flesh get away from your thinking [Applause] oh how did they miss seen it they should have known right quick see what his ministry was oh lord help us there he is the messiah they would have known because he said the scripture is fulfilled church initially they welcomed him they looked on with amazement oh what kind of words that he's talking but then something came across their mind they said oh isn't that someone's son hallelujah the flesh confused them that's right [Laughter] the flash confuses that's right brother said elijah the tishbite was a rugged man he said he wasn't a smooth man how many rugged christians are in the building today we need rocket christians [Applause] i hope we haven't gotten a little too smooth young man don't get too smooth you need to stay rugged young ladies you need a rocket man we ain't preaching no glamour girls we ain't preaching all glamour boys we don't need about this facelift we don't need a message facelift this is the bride's revival we need some rounded christians hey when the going gets off you want a rugged man that'll be there for you not so manzy pamsie weekly worried about his hair all day long come on notice in the messy spiritual food in due season 1965 brother brahma says we find out that god had called him who elijah god called elijah do we have anyone here who god has called is there anyone here that god is called well god called elijah notice he goes on to say and god had talked to elijah god talk to him does god talk to you does god talk to you well then if you're called and god has talked to you come on church notice he said and god had talked to him he said therefore he wasn't afraid of anything so what are you afraid of tonight did god call you yes how's god talk to you yes what you're fearing what are you afraid of just that old devil owl hey church we have god called men god called women gotta stop to these people [Applause] and then you wonder why why why isn't brother so-and-so afraid of anything notice he said god had called him god attacked him therefore he wasn't afraid of anything then brother brahm goes on to say and he wasn't afraid of his message [Applause] hey if you preachers if god has called you and god has talked to you you don't have to be afraid to preach this message no matter in the face of a king no matter in the face of somebody up there you preach it because we need rugged man [Applause] hey god had called him come on you say god called you then who are we to fear are you afraid to talk about god and with your boss oh then can you kick me out brother manuel they'll kick me out of the workplace you're afraid to talk about god at the grocery store oh what do you believe we believe in the bible okay well what do you guys preach over there oh we preach you know preach the bible come on what about you young men when they ask you that school what do you believe come on say i have a message that's been given to us [Laughter] we can't be afraid to preach this message because god has ordained it and if god has her dated he'll back us up hey we just read in the bible that god had come and talked to elijah said hey go down there and tell him this and tell him that well you know what that russian man said i guess i'm gonna go down there and tell him he didn't sit there and think about it well i don't know the king might cut my head off you know i come with a message like that and oh ahab he's a mean one notice he said he he wasn't afraid of his message that it wouldn't happen what does that mean he said well it ain't gonna rain he wasn't afraid that it was gonna rain the next day [Music] he wasn't afraid of the message that god had given him amen that's right come on notice he said he knowed it would happen he knowed it was according to the word of the lord and he know he was god's prophet for the hour [Applause] [Music] therefore the king would cut his head off throw them in jail whatever they do it made no difference to him he had a commission amen he had a commission what was it the same lord that was the commission the son of the lord it ain't gonna rain till i call for it he said that's a mighty big statement isn't it yes it is that's why we can come back and say he wasn't afraid of his message because he know that god had given to him amen and when you finally realize that god gave you this message you'll stop being you back afraid won't be afraid to raise your hand and shout to the lord amen [Applause] can god reveal it to you come on it won't take nothing the gates of hell cannot prevail against it church is giving us this message brother daryl and we go and preach it wherever we and we're not afraid of the consequences why because god said he'll be with you [Music] well what about you oh brother that's only for the ministers no he said he'll be with you too he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you [Applause] notice he had a commission was thus saith the lord right in the face of the king right in the face of the king that's why he said that was a rugged man he was a rugged one and notice when you go out west you got to bring your best optics don't be bringing those bushnell come on hey those are okay from here to there but you bring your good optics because you got to see a long way you got to know what you're going after so you go and you search out and you save a little bit and you ask your wife here let me save a little bit to save up for your best optics and then you start moving up to your vortex and you're like and all these things and you land up if you're if you're lucky you're blessed with a swarovski and even then you're still looking out there and wondering what what is that is is that a head block or is that a forker but you see we had a prophet of god and his optics be our best objects and he can go back and all the way in time and he can look back there and he can say hey i can tell you when it started and i can look that way and i can tell you how it's gonna end and we've heard it before that was our profit optics way better than what we got [Applause] so notice what he does he's able to come up a little bit higher and look back there watch what he tells us are you listening he says oh if we can go back and see israel somebody say israel the way they had taken palestine upon the same bases that we took this united states we come into the united states and drove back the occupants which was the indians and possessed the land you know how you possess this land the occupants before were pushed out somebody could say amen to that but notice he parallels it he goes on to say and so did israel yeah notice come into palestine under the leadership of joshua under god and drove back the opposite the occupants and took the land and their first kings were mighty men i'm going to ask you was david a mighty man he was a mighty man was solomon a mighty man he was a mighty man and a great man our first presidents were great man washington come on church he was a great man yes sir what about lincoln he's a great man notice he says and so forth then finally the presidents or kings become getting more rotten all the time [Applause] tell me you can't see it come on try to lie said oh brother no i don't see it i don't see you tell me you can't see it they have gotten worse and worse and worse and worse all the wait come on time okay reiner and reiner and rotten are you reiner to the one we got today and finally they ended up with ahab did you know brother baby said that ahab was the worst of them all he was the worst of all of them so i got back in thinking by the way and i said is he was he the worst did he kill the most did he torture the most did he mistreat the most but our prophet came with those optics to look down and he said he was the worst because he married an unbeliever [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] under no circumstances should you ever marry an unbeliever [Applause] under no you young men say no circumstances should you marry an unbeliever what you say about brother man she's pretty oh brother baby you should say the way she talks to me it's gonna be all right i'm gonna be that rugged man and i'm gonna tell her what to do come on man but then it comes time when little baby comes and now you start making those harder decisions and she comes and tells you well i think we gotta baptize him in the name of the father and in the son and the holy ghost and then what do you say he said oh i'm gonna be the man of this house and she says well i'm out of here then come on you say oh that doesn't happen brother manuel i have a phone number of a sister she said call her if you think it doesn't happen she said brother manny when you preach that have them to know to call me to never marry an unbeliever so ahab was the worst of all of him what did he do because inner wall the real word come on church you know your pastors have preached it to you and so here was ahab the worst of them all very typical of our day brother graham said and the people had gotten so modern somebody say preacher brother they've gotten so modern the people of that day had gotten so modern what do you mean brother wealthier [Music] this one's gonna hurt come on now they were healthier right they exercise more they ride organic i don't eat red 40 brother manual you don't eat red 40 well it's red 40 that's what you find in the cheetos bags well that has glucose and cucumbers and cucumber i only eat natural so then you eat elk i just threw that one [Applause] they were wealthier and healthier come on church they were more informed they had more information in that day they were modern notice what brother batman said he said and the people had gotten so modern they didn't want to hear the true word of god did you know you can get so modern so smart so healthy so wealthy that you get to a point where the man of god comes and preaches the word you can't even move and say amen and maybe not you because you're hearing the word but what are the people out there and they want you to join him in that what do you mean it means when a crazy preacher comes he said i don't know that's a little too wild for me that's a little too rugged where'd they pull this guy out of come on preach it amen but that's what they said about elijah [Applause] what audacity does he have to come to the king notice brother man says can you imagine on a modern people like that so we set the foundation the modern people healthier wealthier and wiser and more informed that's right all right so he's saying to people like that he says can you imagine he says what a real servant of god would sound like notice he said could you what a real true servant of god would sound like why he was crazy out of his mind oh you say i can't imagine that my pastor is so smart he's so educated wild yeah and they said we can't hear this this man is crazy he's crazy oh come on church what about you preachers out here hey when you go out they say oh you know what i think i'm going to bring one of my friends from school to church tonight i hope brother wayne takes it really easy on her you know this is the first time being a church you want to bring it back i don't know if i'm going to bring my best friend tonight you know they're bringing that guy from new mexico there's a wild west out there it's rugged that's right amen you take these preachers like brother daryl he's out there he's just preaching he knows how that's right can you imagine brother somebody like a catholic boy who's never heard a preacher scream in his life say what in the world the man is preaching hard and he's yelling and he's screaming and he's crying at the same time but you see that's how god uses rugged men that's how he used this man for me and this man for me and this man for me is mad for me we were raised in the church sit down kneel down get up sit down and then it's time to go and do whatever you want to do because you'll just come back and do the same thing and our priest oh he was so young man you've sinned i think you should say 10 hail marys is that gonna help me you better throw in some our fathers too hey i'm telling you from experience church don't you let that cold formal preaching come into this building don't you look after them when you see it at the door you're stopping you say don't bring that here over here we're rugged we want to hear the true word of god i need a man to preach me the truth it don't matter how he acts [Applause] i need to hear i have a savior i need to hear i have a healer i need to have somebody that died for me i need to see blood all over the altar [Applause] i need a living jesus christ [Applause] oh you young ladies don't get so formal so cold on god [Applause] you older ladies too come on church the time for messing around is over we need to get serious with the lord that's why we're here at these meetings that's why god has called the lineup of holy ghost still man if you have a need god is more than able to supply it more than able to supply it you love him [Applause] they used to tell us when we were young you said do you love it marry it you love him marry him then well we're just getting started [Music] with isaac paige numero uno you don't know what that means though page number one brother notice he's saying could you imagine a modern people like that coming a servant of god would come out of the wilderness they would think he's out of his mind notice brother man says they were religious very religious they had sincere men they sound familiar they had sincere men they had sincere people the people were sincere too but notice he says they was very religious so modern they couldn't hear the true word when it was right in front of them [Music] notice so here we have a prophet of god elijah on the scene and he knows what he's dealing with he knows the condition of the people he knows how they're modern he knows how they act he knows they're religious he knows they're sincere notice elijah knew brother bear said that it would take more than just ordinary theology hey you ought to be calling tonight for more than just theology [Applause] say brother we've already been through calvinism we've been through armenianism we want ephesus we want a book of ephesians notice he said it would take more than just ordinary theology it would take more than an ordinary message it wasn't that you were just gonna come and preach and say oh you know what i'm just gonna throw something together you know i'm busy i i don't have much time so i'll just take whatever all that it doesn't matter i'm just gonna put it together but you see that might be all right in some cases but not for a people like that's right he said it'd take more than an ordinary message for that people it would take more than just preaching the word right that's right come on come on yep wait a minute brother i'm saying that my brother sean has stopped me in my tracks i was reading i said what it's going to take more than just preaching more than just preaching the word well that people was religious they had been preached the word come on church ahab had prophets he had hundreds of prophets he had hundreds of smart men hundreds of theology so here comes elijah with the word of god he said it's gonna take more than an ordinary preaching it's gonna take more than an ordinary word [Applause] we love the word but it has to be for our day for our hour it would take more than just preaching the word to do what to crack their stony hearts yes that's right you know it's easy to say oh well they have stormy hearts so those people down the street have stony hearts or they're stonies but what about this boy when he had a stony heart the bible had to take me to ezekiel and say he'll give me a new spirit and he'll give me a new heart [Applause] what for just to be able to hear the word then he says when you receive that then he'll come and give you his spirit yes sir come on church but it took more than something ordinary to crack your stony heart oh many of you here well i know enough is i don't know if that quote is writing i don't know still bringing it part of that right so i'm not too sure where they pulled this guy out of i better watch him yes sir come on notice he it would take more than just preaching the word to crack their stony heart you know what he knowed that it would take thus saith the lord that's what it's going to take in this day too it's going to take more than just bringing them back to an apostolic teaching come on church it's going to take more than just an ordinary service it's going to take more than just going back to church it takes the save the lord where did we have him with the eliza of our day what did brother branham come with thus saith the lord more than an ordinary message more than an ordinary word supernatural left and right [Applause] come on church you know this is more than just an ordinary message you know that he was more than just an ordinary preacher oh well this preacher back there and this preacher they had nothing on him he had just said the lord hey there's nothing wrong with those men back there but it took some more to crack your stony hearts we ought to be thankful tonight me as an ex-catholic boy i say thank you lord because i look back and say how can anybody get out of there hey we have fellow people in there come on we have family members back in that church back home they can't even hear nothing and you say how in the world did i come out how in the world did my dad come out of that do you know that that harlot has such a grip on the people she holds him by fear but we got a message of liberty we got a message of freedom we got a message of grace i'm not here because i'm afraid i'm not here because i'm in fear i've been called i'm god has talked to me i'm not afraid to bring this message [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] notice he said it would take thus said to lord notice he said to spurn that was judgment when god sends you a vindicated prophet and he's vindicated over and over and over again hey don't don't feel bad back in elijah's day when he went up in a chariot there were still scoffers in that day come on church then when he started telling elisha well where is he where is that you saying he went up in a chair yeah what kind of chariot was it oh i had horses of fire it was a chariot of fire this isn't nothing new church reach it right you know brother brahm said when elijah went up to that king and he told him it wasn't going to rain he said that wasn't no ordinary message in fact brother he said it was quite a load he said that was quite a load that he dropped on that king notice he said oh he said that's quite a messenger not no ordinary message and now he said we're going to type that with the spiritual drought today now we all know and we are very aware so you're very aware you know he said that there is a great spiritual drow in the land today spiritually speaking can we say amen to that amen and you know that was predicted by the prophets just before the second coming of christ would be said there will come a famine in the land and it won't be for bread alone but for the hearing of the word of god and that day is now [Applause] hearing the word of god he said now this types the natural with the spiritual sin somebody say sin and unbelief sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church [Applause] in the church had brought the place to this come this coming on coming judgment what brought the judgment of eliza down one brought god come on church eliza was happy he was being fed by the ravens he was there he wanted to drink some water by the brook in fact when god called him i said lord why are you drying up the water come on right because i got a job for you to do there's an oncoming judgment going on because of sin and unbelief where come on now [Music] we all got to say where was it coming from in the church aren't you glad you come out of it [Applause] notice i hope this is all right notice he said sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church had brought this place to a coming oncoming judgment then they had turned from god's word and his prophet to a modern theological terms of the word be careful you don't get too sophisticated don't get too civilized so elijah was put in a secret place didn't we read that in the scripture yeah who put him there the lord put him in this place and we have an understanding that god had ordained it god had ordained him and the place was provided for and elijah was getting fed day by day by day in this secret place now we all have an understanding ahab the king did not put elijah in his place the church did not put elijah in that place let me tell you elijah did not put elijah in that place [Applause] god said i have commanded the ravens to feed you now we have an understanding that that's a type of our secret place where in christ jesus we have a secret place too where is it it's in christ [Applause] now we have to understand during the time that he was sent judgment to the unbeliever but he was said to make a way for the believer amen for what to escape the wrath to come but they laughed at him they thought he was crazy now did you notice we've been taught that a denominational man somebody said denominational a denominational man with him and the support of his denomination they become one a denominational man with the support of his denomination they become one one notice brother said he and his church are one so now we take that and you find you take a theology theologian anybody you know any theologian and they take their theology and their support of their denomination for theology and that theologian becomes one with his theology but notice you take a catholic with the support of his denomination and he becomes you take a baptist with the support of the baptist and he and the baptist become you take a pentecostal with him in the support of his church and they become come bring him up notice brother brahman says when a man comes with thus saith the lord he and his message become [Applause] so let me ask you paul and his message were what iranians and his message were martin and his message were columbo and his message luther and his message was he and his message brother branham and his message the pride and the message one one one one we have been married into this word and the bride and the messenger

with christ jesus [Applause] do we have another hour [Applause] and when elijah come with us saith the lord he and his message became one amen come on amen just as jesus when he come he was the word saint god once said so the word of god and the message of the age was the south same thing brother said all the time so let me ask you are you part of that bride then you and the message have what

said you know what i have to be here why because i'm one with the brothers i'm one with the sisters i'm one with this revealed message of the hour [Applause] notice he said don't you see the authority

are walking we serve a mighty god somebody sh shake somebody by the hand [Applause] i just need 50 more minutes [Applause] but we might need it for the rest of the week duct tape duct tape and baling wire so remember any man and his message are yes sir so notice brother man says he never left the brook until god called him and after the draw was about over he called him out of there down to the widow's house notice he called to this widow and this widow had not associated herself with the unbelievers [Music] now you i'll let your pastor take care of that one because we have love we pray for those that are god but now when you just start associating going to church we'll let you take care of that sean notice he's saying that they took the marker he didn't she did not take the mark of the beast during the drought so he says he called elijah to sustain this widow and they just had one little cake one little thing she was holding on to one little thing and notice elijah said give me that first oh right [Music] you might be holding on to a little bit of christ tonight come on that's good yes sir because we understand that that cake represented christ that's right yes notice but elijah said give me that first for thus saith the lord the barrel will not go empty neither the crews run dry until the day the lord god sends the rain upon the earth brother takes that and he says putting god first how many realize that we've got to put who first we've got to put god first now when we preach that these brothers preach that we all say oh yeah but i can say well you guys you gotta put god first you say oh yeah and the minister brother ronnie comes and he preaches he says guys you gotta put god first you say yeah i do but let me tell you during a draw somebody say preach it brother mary i see you back there you say preach it brother but during a drought right now now let me tell you a famine can bring out the best in somebody a family can bring out the best or it can bring out the absolute worst and who your neighbor and who your pastor himself we can all say amen but when it comes and god puts us through the testing time and he will [Applause] it'll bring out really what you are really what you got if you've got the goods [Applause] can i give you a bible example tonight [Applause] one time during a great famine in the book of second kings they uh israel was surrounded and noticed the king was there walking around and he was seeing the worst in his people they had been cut off from supplies and he looked and there was a woman that cried o king and the king said what's the matter and she answered and she told the king she said well there was this woman and she said unto me give thy son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow so we boiled my son a famine brings out the worst or the best yes sir yes there's a spiritual famine in the land today they're boiling their children and said unto her the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hid her son so the point is the famine will bring out the best or it'll bring out the worst can we say amen tonight what a test you can go back it's all brother emanuel that was such a hard test for her when the prophet of god came and told her give me the little cake first that's right but notice we have the greatest prophet of them all [Applause] and in matthew 10 in red letters he said he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that love his son or daughter more than me is not worthy than me of me can we say amen that's a test and in matthew chapter 6 31 jesus says therefore take no fa saying what shall we yes sir or what shall we drink or wherever all should we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first no this is for you but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you [Applause] there you go so elijah says bake me a little cake first and in other words we know that was saint put cries first why was he saying that he said because here he was coming delivering the care package [Applause] come on man just give it to me first i got some for you just give it to me first oh that's what we're saying tonight just give god preeminence tonight he's got so much waiting for you he wants to give it to you he wants to give it to you right now oh you just put him first put him before school put him before mama put him before daddy before brother before sister put him first he's got so much waiting for you that's the ultimate care package you know the word care it means health how many want health you know the word care means welfare how many god want god to take care of your welfare not the welfare system how many want god to be their maintenance man maintain me lord maintain my body this is part of the health care system of god care means protection how many want god to be your protection care means supervision how many want to be supervised by god care means health that means safe it means housekeeping so here was elijah all he was doing was bringing the care package what was he bringing [Applause] he was bringing the word the unadulterated word that men have messed with for years and he came and he tied up all the loose hands and he gave us the care package he said you want care you've got to care package this is the best package you'll ever see this is better than the massage practice in the vehicle the self-driving car this is the care package no wonder they thought he was crazy [Applause] no wonder they think your preachers are crazy you know that it was a test of trust and you've all been going through it did you know that she had to give up the very thing that she was certain of that's right she had it in her hands this was certainty she said we're going to eat this she was certain of it and she had to give up certainty and many of us had had to give up certainty right a position in the church friendship with a pastor this is the truth that's right we've had to give up so much that's right that was right there in front of us that was certain for what the supernatural she had to give up the certain for the supernatural she had to trust a promise she had to trust thus saith the lord if the musicians would come up let's have the song leader give me five more minutes as they come up remember when we opened up and we read jesus saying there were many widows in israel in the days of elijah but elijah was sent to are you still with me thank you elijah was sent to just one what now brother rabbit said you say and this is something that affected me when i first come into the message we heard the message and we say my goodness this is the best thing we've ever heard in our lives nothing better than this why isn't everybody running around and all excited we would look around and we started traveling and we'd come to meetings and we said well why isn't the brother over there rob at the meeting and they're like well they don't come to our meetings [Laughter] why not well i don't know they never they they don't come see we're fresh to the message we're like well i thought when message believers gathered everybody just traveled and had a big meeting right but it's like it's a little more technical than that brother manuel what's technical there's a meeting going on well right now they're staying at their home church and they're you know they've got us the meeting's right here i know i'm messing the preachers are going to get upset with me but i don't care i'm just telling you what we looked at when we first come in [Applause] no no no they can't why they they can't why can't they while their pastor don't let him he don't let them reach it that's that's okay is that a the pastor or the priest i'm not saying i'm right or wrong i'm just telling you what we see right he's like oh no he won't let them you know
