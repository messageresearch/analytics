========================================

to break every change [Music] is wonderful amen is glorious amen amen finally you found us a privilege to be gathered in his most holy name amen amen hallelujah amen you thank the Lord for the songs that have been sung amen the worship that has gone on amen you may be seated I believe in Ramesh at a testimony we'll call him before amen amen Jesus Christ amenities two verses from psalm 146. amen praise ye the Lord praise the Lord O My Soul while I live will I praise the Lord I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being amen the spawning on repeat all of you in the wonderful name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen even on Wednesday it's not too well I mean it's severe pains I said my hands and I put from the doctor to book a book in they told me there's no bookings for witnessing book on Thursday so when I got home I just prayed I said Lord you know what I want the Elders of the church to lay ends and pray for me and because this is what your word says and it's unusual amen that when I came to the service called for a prayer prayer line and I believe amen you know because I desired that yeah this time shall follow them that believe amen amen and the prophet has always taught us taught us that we must only believe all things are possible hallelujah amen and then uh called for the prayer line I said you know you know it's a prayer answering God Amen who cared for us he cares for everything that has our body our every being of every being and then on Thursday I had the pains very bad and I said that it's very bad and I just pretend to say that amen amen I just thought about what the prophet what the word has said what the pastors preached on an hour later you know the prophet has taught us about the supernatural in his early Ministry and I don't know why we are not embracing it we need to embrace the supernatural amen because our inheritance yes and we are the true inheritors of this Supernatural amen we have seen the glorifier in the days of Moses we have seen the same to the profile in the time of Paul we have seen the same color of fire in this last day oh my goodness amen amen God bless you Brothers for the testimony you believe it's in the prayer answering God Amen it's still Hebrews 13 and 8. still the same yesterday today and forever amen thank you man hallelujah amen so this morning we're happy to be found in the house of the Lord and uh just a few announcements Amen brother Sani sister Lily have left this morning tour of Israel and we pray that the Lord will grant him a bless you amen amen and bring them home safely amen I trust that they will really enjoy you know they they always say I haven't been there but they say the Bible comes alive because we're reading about the woman at the well and we're reading about Jerusalem and reading about the temple or believing and have the opportunity to go and visit these places amen so we pray that the Lord will blessed him amen so stay Elaine and sister Jaylen are still recovering after the accident amen I'm sure most of you know amen they were caught up in the accident on the m41 and they have requested the church to continue to pray for them as they recovery amen and we really want to thank the Lord for his protection over them amen yes the message I preach Entertaining Angels amen because the angels of the Lord are always encamped around us and from last year we've been preaching on the wings of a mighty Angel amen we've been speaking on the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord is in the message the angel of the Lord is on earth now fixing things my brother Ramesh is talking about it's already it's already happened for the numbers it's already happening we're already writing another book of Acts it's no more a future tense thing amen amen we are currently writing another book of Acts amen if we had to take and document all the supernatural that has transpired amen there will be volumes written I'm talking about amongst the pride of Jesus Christ amen if just locally has been working so supernaturally with us how about the entire body of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah the thing is we can't hold back on our testimony and be a thief with the testimony because sometimes God does things to us and we know we are too shy to come and testify about it amen we are not to do that yes you know when the Lord healed uh he told him go and tell them you remember that song I got to tell somebody that Don Francisco said he just couldn't keep it in himself he had to tell somebody amen amen hallelujah and the prophet says if you don't know what to say just tell somebody how your fire got lit tell him amen tell him about the service tell him about what was being preached amen and the Lord can move in a supernatural way Hallelujah so we've been amazed and we've just been you know uh observing the way the Lord has been moving how many have you been observing that amen I know if you can testify that there's certainly been a change in your very own lives amen there's been a change and a shift in the act atmosphere because the holy spirit is now moving away in a specific season amen and some will find themselves in revelation 22 because the Bible can't do much more than give you the Holy Spirit and if you don't want to conform to the word the Bible says let him that's holy be holy and let him that's filthy be filthy you're either going to get more on fire for God or you're going to get more backslidden amen so when God is moving let's move with this program and I tell you you know we made that statement about the angel of the Lord being present with that accident and and protecting his daughters there that day amen so I went to visit them and uh myself brother Joshua we never spoke about it but both of us was doing private investigative work there amen when we were talking about it we were both amazed that we both went through the scenes of the photograph and we were looking for unusual things and you know because if we know the angel of the Lord is there we are looking for the evidence of it and the proof of it amen so sister Jalen uh just made also Elaine was referencing the testimony she was recalling and she says you know what after she had some time to sit and think about it she was thinking what happened just before the accident I'm not trying to spiritualize anything I'm telling you their testimony if they were here they'll tell you exactly the same thing in fact you can verify it with them she tell them what happened just before the accident was that Jaylene was telling a mom can you see that cloud there for those of you didn't click you see clouds every day what would make sister Jalen point out that specific thing that looked unusual about something unusual so if you know where the accident took place you got a direct view of the ocean when you're traveling down that m41 there so they they're saying normally it's very clear but sister Jaylene saw this thing and she was trying to show it to her mom and you know what the surprising thing is to stealing couldn't see it now if you know about Dimensional Doors and how the prophet told open the boy's eyes amen so they describe it as some sort of mist or a cloud that was there but sister Elaine says she couldn't see it but Jalen showed her and she was just about to open the window to say mom look there when the accident took place so what was materializing amen come on Church don't be dull amen amen you've got to recognize when God is moving amen amen amen could it be that she saw the angel of the Lord materializing yes thank you right and coming in on the scene because what caught my attention was how all of them were protected it was like the hands of the Angel are protecting and moving and you know orchestrating the whole thing amen we don't have time right now but we'll share testimonies I had experiences like this brother Joshua had experiences where we were involved in terrible accidents and there's not a dent on the car amen who is protecting us it's the angels of the Lord amen amen so amen remember amen them in prayer and who is that it's the same one that materialized in the Lion's Den it's the same one that means realize when the three Hebrew boys were thrown in the fiery furnace because he is the present help in the time of trouble amen and if you can do it for them he can do it for you hallelujah amen I know you don't believe in church amen amen hallelujah so Wednesday night uh 7 PM we left Pastor Paul key from India be ministering first so look forward to that service pray for the service that the Lord will bless us and visit us once again through the word and through the manifestation and power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen so let's stand together this morning for the reading of God's word Hallelujah have you found prayed up amen have you come looking for a blessing amen just bear with me amen I've got to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit and sometimes we've got to dwell on certain things amen so this morning we'll speak on have you been sealed with the Holy Ghost since you believed the message of the owl amen amen have you been sealed with the Holy Ghost since you believed the message of the hour let's turn to Acts Chapter 19 Verse 1. I believe this is the most important question we can ask and this is where you know the prophet preaches a message where I think Pentecost failed to we can update that message we can say where I think some message people are failing so Acts chapter 19 and verse 1 we're going to find here the Apostle Paul is traveling to uh it says that it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth call having passed through the upper course came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples you find towards the end of the chapter you read There was 12 disciples then so 12 disciples and he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and ask yourself there since you believe the message of the hour have you have you received the Holy Ghost I want you to separate it because doesn't mean that you believe the message of the hour that you got the Holy Ghost and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism so some are staying with just the forerunner's message but we need to connect with the angels message amen amen get that deeper meaning there now this is the first Forerunner he's got disciples that even after Jesus came and died buried rose again they're still following his ministry they haven't progressed they hadn't gone to the upper room can you believe they were under the message of the first Forerunner and hadn't gone to the upper room hmm could there be people under the message of the second Forerunner and have not gone to the upper room to receive the holy ghost things don't change history doesn't change amen history repeats itself and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and said unto John's baptism then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus now the Angel's message all along was if you get the people to believe you a son of man if you get the people to believe you a son of man but there came a point in the prophet's Ministry where he said that's our Lord up there a son of man now needs you to believe this son of man amen amen there is a transition yes that's why the voice of God cannot try to idolize and lift up the prophet's Ministry and try to preserve his ministry his legacy is already preserved in scripture amen amen it's already written in scripture it's engraved in Scripture they don't need to do it amen amen the Lord wrote him in Scripture but now the focus must be the son of man that's why the prophet is saying I must decrease and he must increase amen hallelujah when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid out his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12. now let's turn to Luke 3 16. we all know John 3 16 right for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life amen yes Luke 3 16 tied in perfectly with that now here's the foreign is saying I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the latchet of full shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire amen amen have you received the Holy Ghost fire amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated so what are we learning there it is the purpose it is the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen amen you can move along on the slides they have got certain slides there amen so it is the ministry of Jesus Christ to give you the Holy Ghost you've got to ask amen amen now we find that man is seeking spiritual fulfillment to satisfy any craving that he has and if you can testify to that spiritual creating amen he pursues religion and he devotes himself to that religion and that religion gives him a false peace he gives him a false hope and they believe as long as they continue serving that religion they will attain favor with God doesn't matter what kind of reward they receive they are even prepared to receive a reward of if I'm good I'll come back as an end I'll come back as a whatever they believe in reincarnation some of them some are waiting for seven virgins okay some are waiting for silly Rewards but the Lord says if you seek me you will find me amen amen is that scripture if you seek me you will find me is he going to come and just throw himself all over you no you must seek after God doesn't the Bible say Seek he trust the kingdom of God Amen there's a part for you to play amen a man must be born again of water and of spirit you'll find that in John chapter 3. when Jesus is talking to Nicodemus must be born of water and of spirit before he can achieve anything in this human life without the Holy Ghost we are living fruitless meaningless life that will end in disappointment to read what King Solomon said his life ended the disappointment he said oh everything is meaningless he says fear God and serve him so don't do anything further in this life without first establishing the number one most important necessary ingredient which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes the key now we're wondering why we can't have faith before you can even start to build that pyramid you know the statue of a perfect man you can't even start to build that pyramid without the Holy Ghost you say no brother you got it wrong because the Holy Ghost is on top no that's what SEALs you that what that's in the Capstone The Headstone so without the Holy Love we're wondering why people don't are spiritually healing in your faith wondering why things are not working out why is my afraid so weak why can't I succeed in life why am I spiritually dry why do I believe the message but I can't see any fruit or progress in my Christian walk it's because you don't have the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost you can't have faith without the Holy Ghost you can't have love without the Holy Ghost you won't have joy because what is the Holy Ghost righteousness peace joy in the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of God now I'm going to reiterate this because I am slow because I need to get it Jesus said seek he first yes amen what does first mean Jesus do not say that the kingdom will come to the predestinated Wherever You Are just lay on your laurels yes seek amen amen amen you know what happens when you seek something first yes it becomes your priority amen no in order to seek you have to have a desire right to do something now God does not reward the lazy he's not going to let you into the kingdom and let you see spiritual things in the Kingdom if you do not seek the kingdom how can we expect spiritual experiences if we are just lazy yes yes we are not dedicated we are not praying we are not looking for Supernatural experiences it's just not going to come and give you Supernatural experiences shall be filled amen yes Lord thank you so God is not going to reward the lazy ask yourself am I seeking the kingdom how diligent then are you in seeking the kingdom yes is it once a week he said I'll pass the thing whenever I remember yes Lord when you feel like giving me an experience Lord now you can't put experience over the world so much of time do we spend with the word amen because any experiences we have we have to learn it back with the world yes the prophet says don't run and take experiences over the world now laboring on the point seek Him First first means first not second is your seeking the kingdom first place when something is first place it takes all your time it takes all your energy amen it takes your emotions you will have no time for other things if you are seeking the kingdom first what is the kingdom it's the Holy Ghost amen is the kingdom in a particular location is Jesus talking about heaven what does he mean when he says seek ye first the kingdom Jesus means seek ye the Holy Ghost because his kingdom is coming to the Earth how is this Kingdom coming by the Holy Ghost he's coming to establish his will in the heart of man now he doesn't stop there he said seek ye first the kingdom and his righteousness God does not use the lazy when God called David he was tending to sheep and he was having Supernatural experiences while protecting what God had put in charge over is everyone following God does not reward the lazy God does not anoint the lazy amen David was sending sheep when God Called Moses he was tending Jethro's sheep he was not lazy amen when God called Isaiah he was serving in the temple when God called Samuel he was serving in the temple with Eli amen amen when God called Elisha what was he doing walking in the field under Elijah amen when God called Peter Peter was at work amen pizza was a fisherman but Jesus told him because you're a good fisherman I'm Gonna Make You Fishers of Men amen amen Hallelujah God does not use the lazy neither does he called the lazy because God is looking for people who be workers in his kingdom amen ask yourself am I walking in the Kingdom amen I'm just here for the blessings Lord I'm just here for the blessings some people you know they say the Natural Touch of spiritual there are people who are looking for blesses for those of you know what that is there are women out there or they call them they're looking for blesses looking for men who can just spoil them and buy things for them without any commitment amen so have you been sealed with the Holy Ghost since you've believed the message of the hour amen let's go to that first quote in what is the Holy Ghost given for you know what the brother Bradham is saying here he said if I could only with my human voice placed into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would be the most wonderful Revelation that you ever had in your life and he says You must do it amen So when you say have you believed what must I believe you need to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen do I believe just in the Lord Jesus Christ accept him as your lord and savior Redeemer coming to the the one who came into the world born of a virgin died to pay the price for my sin rose again on the third day ascended on high and when he went up he said the Holy Spirit back to the end and then he's coming back to receive us again amen yes so have you this have you been sealed with the Holy Ghost this will answer all the questions we have in the message when it comes to Ministries we just told you God doesn't call the lazy Lord I want to go to Nations you can't cross the street Lord if only a Time yet the 10 minutes you got you're idle doing nothing call me call me full time you've got half time you're doing nothing God doesn't reward the lazy God doesn't call the lazy amen when it comes to churches when it comes to the younger generation and now the attending message Churchill out of tradition because their parents were in a messy church so they follow likewise because it becomes a culture for them to go and attend the message Church because their father told them it's right because they have a head knowledge denominations are wrong we come to the message Church it will answer the question as to why people don't have love it'll answer the question why people don't have faith why people don't have joy white people don't have freedom to worship what somebody giving a testimony you are so dry you can't even clap your hands to thank the Lord you're not even excited for their testimony because even when something happens to you you are so dry about it it's my right if you call me his son you must give it to me so dry so dry you know the investment you can write dry on your skin dry in the house of the Lord the Bible says the fruits of our lips giving praise well if he wants my praise he must really work for it I'm not just gonna say Amen my amen is too precious I need to conserve my voice because when I go on my scream at my husband and she Shout at the children how can I shout in the house of the Lord and give him praise amen people don't have freedom to worship and I tell you that's another key as to why people don't have the victory when the people got the victory there's a shot of Praise there's a shot in the camp amen there's a Jubilation in their hearts they are giving God praise amen it will answer why people are spiritually dead spiritually lazy have no spiritual discipline to read the Bible every day and pray is because you have not been sealed with the Holy Ghost oh the answer to all of these questions is that people have not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost we assume because we go to a message church we think it's automatic because we believe the message Judas believe the message of the hour he was anointed to cast out Devils if you had to look at that you're saying wow powerful Judas he could cast out Devils pray for the sick and they were healed he held office in the church but he never went on to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he sold out the Messiah in James 2 19 it says now believeth that there is one God that does well the Devils also believe and tremble people in the message believe and they don't even tremble but the Bible says demons believe and they tremble you know it's a fearful thing to come into the presence of An Almighty God how many if you can say Amen to that amen amen so believing alone is not enough because they are Devil's belief believing alone is not enough it is the first step because in Hebrews 11 6 says without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen what the one that is diligently seeking him men men yes amen you're the prophet talking about Peter telling you that Peter had been saved Peter believed in the Lord Peter followed Jesus Jesus told him who he was and told him to follow him he gave him power against unclean spirits and Sanctified Peter but Jesus came to a point where he says you are not converted Peter amen he said I've prayed for you he says after you are converted the prophet says he had shouted he probably danced in the spirit he had done all kinds of things but he hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet amen amen after you are converted then strengthen your brethren that's true carry out his plan now you say oh I'm a bit skeptical about you you said that I don't have faith because I don't have the Holy Ghost I don't have love because I don't have the Holy Ghost but let's go to Galatians 5 and 22. if you go to an orange tree and you want to have some oranges what must you see on the tree you must see the fruit on the tree if you want the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has fruits amen but the fruit of the spirit is love now does does the fruit cometh when it's in seed form you can you go to the seat and say I want fruit it says the Fruit of the Spirit meaning that the spirit has had time to work in your life to get rid of all the nonsense in your life the Holy Ghost seed in you and time to make the old man die rot out amen and to start to grow the spiritual man amen and now when you are grown up there's fruit hope you're reading Way Beyond that scripture there when it says the Fruit of the Spirit that doesn't happen overnight you're gonna allow the Holy Spirit to work in you because you know this flesh is really a terrible person Enemy Number One doesn't want to cooperate with the spirit always lazy always working against the spirit so the Holy Spirit needs time to walk now amen amen spiritual discipline as you start to apply the spiritual discipline Lord I'm going to read your word Lord I'm going to pray Lord I'm gonna fast Lord I'm gonna spend time alone in your presence Lord I'm gonna meditate on your word the spirit man within you is growing and it's growing and it's growing amen then you'll find you got love you got love for your brother you got love for the lost you got love for the Raging Bull I'm not talking about your husband or your wife you got love for the killer bee you got love for the man who spits on your face in a public platform yes you got joy like a river I've got joy like a river Joy like a river in my song Amen amen I've got peace like a fountain peace like a fountain peace like a fountain in my soul the Lord must be long suffering with me but you've got no patience with anyone long suffering is the fruits of the Holy Spirit long suffering with your children long-suffering with the wife long suffering with a husband long suffering with the family gentleness gentleness because the holy spirit is like a dove gentleness gentle gentle goodness amen do we know what goodness is do we express goodness I'll scratched that person's back when he's touched my pet last time I asked him to come scratch my back you know what he told me he said you don't have time he says scratch David even if they don't scratch your back [Music] here's another one now yes wait then faith is hidden as number seven is it number seven faith is the Fruit of the Spirit I believe the youth between the statue of a perfect man and he started now on faith you see why you can't even get scattered because faith is the Fruit of the Spirit amen amen you see why you need faith you see why you need the Holy Ghost because what is this really doing let's finish it first meekness meekness the meat shall inherit the earth and then temperance temperance do you see what the Holy Ghost how it empowers you it actually this kind of a person is not a natural person this is not a normal person amen let's put the supernatural element in you because this you don't find in the world this you find impersonation of it in the Buddhist in the in the other Krishna movement and all of these things right and that is why we should be ashamed of ourselves that we even say these things that there are many good people out there because some of them are better than us but in this Holy Ghost can build this kind of a person in us and these are the fruits that now what is the fruit meant to do for people to eat of it this fruit is meant for people to eat of it the fruit of the spirit people must Feast on your love on your joy and your peace and your lungs are free they must Feast on your gentleness and your goodness and your faith and your meekness and on your Temperance amen they must be able to enjoy this yes amen that's what the fruit is for for the enjoyment of others help us Lord yeah a tree doesn't bear fruit for itself a free a three bears fruit for the enjoyment of others amen amen Matthew 17 our lord Jesus says wherefore by their fruits you shall know them didn't we describe that further I'm just thinking about this now further the Lord Jesus didn't he describe it when he said how will he know that they are my disciples if you eat one of their fruit if they have love one for another when you see the fruit of love one for another you know that these are my disciples amen amen so Amy and I hope I dropped that point there we are not converted till we go to the upper room amen we can have received a message have we been to the upper room have we been sealed Holy Ghost and Fire say Lord one to all is about I was watching the video clip and his button many of you know that famous story faint like potatoes how you believe God for the impossible and where there was no rain and you need rain in order for potatoes to grow he had faith and he sold potatoes and the Lord opened up the Heavens it rained and he produced the largest crop of potatoes if you watch that movie felt like potatoes it'll give you Angus button story amen and I was watching this clip and this man is really a man of faith and he's preaching at this thing and I think it's in Israel or somewhere and he says Lord I'm standing here on the Holy Land again and if you did it back there in the upper room where you came like a mighty rushing wind you can do it again now amen and he said I came out praying that I came out into these meetings believe that and he starts to take the scripture and he's reading Acts chapter 2 and he started to read out the Holy Ghost came like a mighty rushing win and you know they got cameras set up all over and the camera is set up into the audience it's an open field and suddenly the winds start to blow push God launder your faith amen yes yes if you seek it amen we come with no expectation that's part of seeking amen Lord I'm gonna seek you in the house of the Lord today I'm going to have this expectation Lord you said you can come if you came that day like a mighty rushing wind oh God you came with clove and tongues of fire and you settle upon each of them and when they Lord were filled they began to stagger out of there like drunk men Lord you can give me that same experience amen amen they started to speak with other tongues what did he do it made them bold they were hiding in the upper room 120 of them hiding in the upper room scared for their lives but the Holy Ghost Empower them they staggered onto the streets amen amen onto the streets they went and the Apostle Peter amen the spokesman the one to whom the Revelation was given the one is the amen Upon This Rock I shall build my church I give you the keys to the kingdom stood up amen full of the Holy Ghost man and he said men and Brethren this is Joel too amen amen amen amen this is that they asked what must we do to be saved preaching under the Holy Ghost what made them recognize they were lost amen not evening residence you're not talking about our modern day openness we haven't come here to change you from your religion we haven't come here to change you from you traditions right there you know many times I want you to switch the mic off but out of respect I left it on if you didn't come to do that what you're preaching for yes you know what it shows you've got nothing to offer the people I came to tell you tickled my ears black black and white whites because that today will open up our eyes in hell and you shall receive the gift of the whole go read Peter what he says yes and for you this morning thank you man get away then I believe from your heart amen if you have yes oh you know but maybe through those quotes many times something you can do situation yes your children how many times do things thank you Lord so into the kingdom amen thank you individuals each individual in the church it clear what he's trying to say is when a man is proven and God loves him he takes him out some way to himself this is what he's doing with us why I'm bringing this it's what he's doing with us right now they're in front of angels he does something for him God's not ashamed in the presence of angels He will do something for you amen he lifts him up into the presence of God and gives him and fills him and sets him out that's the age that we are living in amen if you want to say Lord let that be me yes let that be me Lord prove me Lord oh take me somewhere in presence of the Angel Lift Me Up into the presence of God oh Lord fill me and set me out amen amen I want to tell you something March 14th is coming many of you don't know what March 14th is March 14th was a day that this church transitioned in terms of leadership pick up that quote I think I've got it open there to find it in 17 weeks of Daniel let's find out what happened on March 14th because I was trying to find my own commission for the church and I can find it no place but in the message of the hour so March 14th will be two years amen and this is what came up there March 14th let's just go up so they can see what scripture the prophet is reading it says now I got some writing here that I'd like to read to you as we go by the going forth of the Commandment to rebuild Jerusalem amen amen amen as the walls of the messy Church been torn down Church this can't be coincidence amen maybe for this church I can't speak as a mandate for everyone else Hallelujah men but the Lord is setting forth a decree on March 14th amen Amen to go and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem amen amen rebuild the walls of Son of Man Ministry because the enemy has come in like a flood but the Lord has risen up a standard in this day amen he says which day was that now the prophet is putting a date to it when that decree went forth he said this was the 14th day of March if any one of you want to put that down in the Hebrew you'll find it Nissan which means March the issue was given on the 14th day of March and the issue went for to build rebuild the Temple amen you understand as you people have read the scripture until it was completed it taken 49 years to complete the temple and the city to rebuild it he goes on and he says the walls and it will be built in trouble sometimes don't you feel that way ask the ministry we are rebuilding in Troublesome times if you go and read there what they were doing amen you know about sambara and all these people were against their building so actually when they got to building they had the mortar in one hand and they were building fixing an air The Sword in the other hand while they were laboring they had to protect themselves right right that's how we were living in now because under that photos Rider all hell is let loose the Bible says Hell Followed him but thank God in Revelation 10 all Heaven is coming down amen amen all Heaven is coming down to back up and equip God's people so March 14th is a very special day in God's Bible and Noah tied it in this church and March 14th will be a special day rebuilding time amen aren't you glad that the entire Temple is not torn down that we still have pillars in the house of God Amen we just need to rebuild amen the walls amen amen amen Hallelujah if it's scriptural it must be scriptural amen amen we must find ourselves in the scripture you know the prophet says find yourself in the scripture amen and he says and then you call an identification he says there's always some man something in the Bible that you know you can tie yourself to remember he went to the Bible and didn't he find himself some people identify with David some people identify with the prophets amen Hallelujah so we know amen that the Holy Ghost we can go to the next slide we I don't think we can have much time to go through all of this but we go as the spirit leads now no man could come to him say Jesus except the fire the first draws him so maybe you're asking how do I get the Holy Ghost you kind of shook me in my boots man I'm wondering if I got the Holy Ghost do you know the most confused people and the message about the Holy Ghost they don't know whether they got it they don't if they don't have it they'll give you us if I if you ask denomination they'll say I got the Holy Ghost right because they say that's the evidence am I right right and why are you laughing here I think they like that okay that's why they always sing what is the evidence message people have been hiding behind us for years don't know so they can't produce the fruit so they tell you no brother Brian did say in the end of his ministry that if you believe the message of the hour and you got the Holy Ghost didn't we just labor to tell you that just because you believe doesn't mean you got it right if you believe what are you doing about it you're walking past the house every time you're going past a card you're living your engine you for nothing but you're not doing nothing about it what are you doing about it sometimes she gets fed up and she come talk to you first now you think she's fast she can see you're a shy guy amen what are you doing about the message of the hour it says the holy spirit is Zoe he says Zoe is the holy spirit have we got it Zoe is the Holy Spirit amen he says Now watch how he takes a scripture and he reveals the scripture he says all that the father has given me will come to me and all that comes to me I will give him the Holy Ghost and I'll raise him up at the last day so what is he teaching us the Holy Ghost tells resurrection power amen I'll raise him up at the last day he says no ifs and Bucks about it all the times I will give him eternal life he'll have to raise it because he's got eternal life he has to come can't die no more than God can die if you got the Holy Ghost then you have eternal life he says when you accept Christ as your personal savior you are believing unto the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is not bad this is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is he saying just believing is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost my dear Baptist Brethren it is wrong a brother said to me the other day I think I've carried some things here he says when you accept Christ as your personal savior okay we read this let's go on he says that's all he can do today right is believe God but God gave him a seal of circumcision amen as a sign that he has accepted his faith in him you believe unto him when he accepts him as you when you accept him as your personal savior but when God gives you the Seal of the Holy Ghost he sealed you to a Eternal destination amen so there's a Believing on your path and then there's a receiving on God's part when he receives your friend he sealed you with the Holy Ghost amen and there's Ephesians 4 you are sealed until the day of your Redemption create not the spirit of God Amen Hallelujah let's go on what's the next one we got here he says Beyond you can say Jesus is the Christ you [Music] that's the only way you know the resurrection is when the Holy Ghost Bears record when the Holy Ghost has come he will testify of me show you things to come bring these things that I said to your memories you'll never find it in the school that's what's the problem the Holy Spirit can't bring the message of the hour and the word of the day to your memories because you've got nothing in your memory you don't read the message you don't know the message so the Holy Ghost now that he's supposed to come and bring these things to your remembrance and to equip you with this word and to give you rapturing Faith to this message of the hour spiritual food in due season invisible Union there's nothing there that the Holy Ghost can bring to your remembrance nothing there for the Holy Ghost to take and work because the Holy Ghost is the action in you amen the Holy Ghost wants to work but there's no word being fed nothing nothing the Holy Ghost is the doing part in your life amen he sends him to equip the believer amen but you are not feeling of the word he's got nothing to use you feed the Holy Spirit by the word yes amen Faith cometh by the hearing of the word he says so he's talking here you know he spoke about his weddings that I do Holy Spirit that's in you amen the Holy Ghost in you to continue the same work that he's doing in Christ he wants to do it through you he says now it was the Holy Ghost in Luther's day the Holy Ghost in Wesley's day but because of the word it can equip them partially yes hear what he says here the work wasn't so needy in the days of Luther so remember the more powerful the word comes the more you feed the Holy Spirit it can Empower you great and that's why the end time church is prophesied to be a super church and a super race is because of the word that's come down amen it's the word that makes us super yes it's the word that equips us but if we are not feeding on the body word of the son of man the Holy Spirit got nothing to work with we just go around saying we believe the message we believe the message give the Holy Ghost food amen he says the world wasn't so needy in the days of Luda a little bit more needier in the days of Wesley the Bible says that you know men were getting weaker and wiser and more wicked all the time men do things today a hundred years ago you would have thought that being you would have thought that being human being be that cruel he's saying man's has gone so cruel amen let's go to the next slide so the Holy Spirit has been moving can you testify to them there was just a little breath of it with Luther a little blow of it with Wesley and a deeper blow of it would Pentecost just blow now the bread and the spirit has become the same she is uniting together bringing forth the same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like he did back there talking about Pentecost talking about X2 now he's manifesting the same works like he did right there he's being manifested right today the same thing amen and I stand here and testify that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he can still do the same Works amen wake up people the Holy Ghost is here to fill you the Holy Ghost is here to empower you amen make you a super church and a super race thank you Lord are we seeking him amen I want you to know your amen you are not going against the wind he wants you to believe him just want it for you amen amen it's not against you any of them you can find assistance that will pray you through amen not gossip about what you said have confidence in the person that they will pray with you that they will seek the face of the Lord until you come through that situation because the Holy Ghost is in Sons and Daughters of God thank you Lord thank you Lord recognize his presence amen Hallelujah someone you can draw straight from amen how many of you have met people like that or you can just draw straight from there you know just one phone call to them you'll be getting shrimped amen hallelujah you can't wait to share your testimony you can't wait to shame man with that person draw from the Holy Ghost if your brother is filled with the Holy Ghost amen I draw from the Holy Ghost you know what happens sometimes when a car is losing its charge and the battery is trying to swing it questions you need to connect to another battery don't you get jumper cables and get another battery maybe sometimes your faith is weak maybe sometimes your trouble connect with another brother a Holy Ghost Field brother amen but can't jump on tables amen connect with the word let's just jump the cables the word and you'll start your engine amen amen that's right amen the Holy Ghost filled person is the most amazing person you will ever meet in this life amen hallelujah they have the spirit of the Lord within them and sometimes the answers to our problems and the answers to our trials and the wisdom will come from a Holy Ghost Field brother and sister or some are not getting this sometimes the wisdom you need and the answer you need will come from a Holy Ghost Field brother or sister amen don't underestimate your brother and sister that's right amen don't disregard them take them as your brother and sister amen what happened to brother Joshua told me that sister Vanessa hey please just stop there you stop coming towards me some of you don't know what happened here gospel the Joshua's testimony nerve trouble what happened if you reacted in the flesh and he said what have I to do the woman he could have stopped his healing amen don't only estimate one another amen know that they are born again and filled with the spirit of God and Jesus spoke about this time when Holy Ghost will come and Tabernacle in the hearts of men man know that his spirit is here living in individuals and we recognize this presence we have got to have confidence in the one preaching the word you know the prophet tells you that and you should amen how about holy ghosts and their daughters do we have confidence in them amen amen the prophet says we are not building an organization he says I'm not sure this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word amen by his word to build up the individual to that place not to build a greater message church I'm telling you that now we are not here looking to build a greater Message Church but we are looking to build individual Sons and Daughters of God I'm glad I found my commission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem amen you're in closing now what the prophet says Satan will lie to you young people you are trying to get that boy's number you're trying to get the girl's number you're trying to listen to the egg you're getting frustrated I can't download this pop song why do you want to connect with that spirit stop it listen to the spirit's voice you will be the most happiest if you're filled with the spirit listen to what he says you're going to lose some privileges with the world now you're going to lose some good times with the world especially you young people he says oh my but you don't have to drink you don't have to smoke you don't have to run in these places of amusement why the holy spirit is a million times better than all the devil can offer you how many times better a million times better than all the devil could ever offer you so you notice we had to come back to this Junction is because we don't want to leave anyone behind amen have you been sealed with the Holy Ghost message of the hour since you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ have you been sealed with the Holy Ghost don't just give me a quick answer and say yes examine your life and let's see because the Holy Ghost will desire to be filled with the things of God the Holy Ghost will feed on the word so much time you're spending with the word the Holy Ghost wants you to spend time in prayer how much of time you're spending in prayer let me tell you fathers and mothers your children are looking to you as an example they may not always tell you that but they are watching your life they're watching your testimony they're watching the things you do they're watching everything the way you talk to Mommy they're watching the way mommy talks to Daddy you're watching everything and you know what you're doing you are imprinting these things for the future generation and they say this is the way my mother and father did it and this is the way I must do it we need to project Jesus Christ in our lives if we need to project the Holy Ghost in our lives amen and lead them to spiritual experiences so that they can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the most precious thing we can ever have remember the prophet says if I can get you to do anything I want you to understand the importance of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost we know that message Church can be turned overnight into a Powerhouse into a super race into a super Church into an invincible Army because we have the most powerful word there's no word like the word that we have yes yes what's lacking is the Holy Ghost to take that word Empower you bring it to your own remembrance show your things that are to be amen
