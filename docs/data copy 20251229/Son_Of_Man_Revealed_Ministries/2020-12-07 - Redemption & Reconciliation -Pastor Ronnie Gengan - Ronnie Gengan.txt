it's taken the initiative to come the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went up to the place of which God had called him then on the third day his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abraham said to his young man abide here with the head and high and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you in and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father except my father he said ya Am I my son and he said we are the fire in the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself 11 for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God told him off and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in what s and burnt and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called on him out of heaven and said Abraham tell thy son that only sent from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket with his arms and April I went and took the RAM and offered him for a burnt offering in the stead of a son Isaac amen praise the Lord and Abraham called the name of the place geometry as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time prays alone that just pray this morning you ever need every

amen let's pray this morning Lord Jesus we thank you love that you made a way for us that's why we can come and stand yellow to glorify your name to magnify your name what a glorious day the preliminary and Lord we know your word is spoken of these days perilous times shall be upon the earth men's up faithful here and Lord we thank you Lord we can never shut ins in your word everything that will pass away but your words will not pass away what we bring every request this morning you see the hearts of your people and Lord you are here what July you will provide this morning I pray Lord that you grant them the needs Lord according to the faith in the heart Lord and Lord prove you this morning and trust in you lord he breaks them right now redemption means the action of of being saved from sin there are on evil Redemption the action of saving or being saved from sin God's plan for redemption of this world see so redemption is God what a save people so if you want to save them they're lost right they separated from him right so he wants to bring them back to him right so it's a saving free sin in for payment or clearing a depth the depth light the intention so your slate becomes clear God redeems you and reconciliation to balance things some of their similar works to reconciliation is reuniting reunion property uation rectification settling resolving mehndi remedy the story restoration of harmony agreement compromise understanding peace to him and then to austerities the approachment avinasi squaring adjustment balancing that's reconciliations right now anyone any one of your company you'll know that well work very well in reconciliation skill incompatibility see the action of taking one view that so I'm just giving you to see that you'll know the meaning of it sometime also children and maybe someone else you know you speaker you speak something named you wonder whether they're really understand there's something some terms that we use also like not like we might say the Prophet went in turns around the world but they might think it one time you won't take time to round the world they were jumping ahead of plate and he went round the world eight times so sometime you can explain it to them eight times during the course of his ministry right you went so in a country reconciliation is a process reconciliation we use to ensure that the money living in account matches the actual money spent this is done by making sure that then but so if somebody is cooking the books or something and when they become solid they can see seven bunnies now they said went for certain place and didn't happen at all but if they've got all the receipts and it was done and God was in Christ they conceived reconciling the world to himself see God was in Christ that's what the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself praise the Lord Amen right and then yeah we find that Redemption only came through Jesus Christ to redeem to bring back to its original position right so that's why God uses that idea of Abraham that Abraham went to learn what remember can offer your son for a sacrifice and God showed him that there was a lamb there and the lamb is Genesis Exodus and show that sorry reconciliation and leave them I say man and examine the LEM for four days there to make sure there was no blemish because a perfect length so that is trapping Christ amen and after examine the lamb and make sure there was nothing wrong with it and the glades less lieutenant pilots home and their private cells are find no fault in him he examined me me questioning me in a hole man and a fee and the way Jesus stood by him he said I find no fault in it in that race god that is confirming there is no fault in Jesus a man he endeavoured to get you to say that sacrificing the perfect leg amen and all Redemption and reconciliation he's gonna come you know I'm sure worthy amen amen want me to take the book amen because the Bible says there's nobody worthy amen they look for somebody to come forth see and nobody kid and comfort the way there were prophets going through ages and know that some of those prophets really live good lives yes that's true they were not worthy Jesus worthy because you never come the way he and he was sinless and that's a blood oath required a perfect blood God's own blood praise the Lord so we find that the time here was God showing that he was going to be the sacrifice [Music] now God and to send the son why did he send me son why do you becoming tough that God is a spirit that's up to God for man he couldn't come in guidance that's why you have to take on the form of a man God was in Christ amen right so it was not gone now you know sending his son to go to pay the price and and things like that that'll be a very cruel thing if her father is in a problem and he you know he's gonna go to face something you'll be a cool thing for him percent he said you can fix the problem amen keep I said no listen yeah I'm going to fix the problem so God had to face the problem but it came in he sent a man to do the work of redemption they meant to do the work of reconciliation why he had to bring back because of what happened in the Garden of Eden oh man now they Garden of Eden they separated themselves from God disobey by the influencing of Satan they didn't want to do it Adam and Eve he didn't want to do it the Bible said the serpent beguiled them and then he took the Word of God and he he put one word God said you would surely die by one we are all tired Adam and through Jesus Christ we all live praise a lot so we had a first Adam we had the second Adam Jesus Jesus Christ amen the blood and the blood amen right so God planned it like that and that's why he had to come and people had to be there to press play the role of killing him of passing all the judgments and everything the Bible says will come upon him say that God had to have certain people playing the role over there you're dead okay there's many many sounds talking about Jesus gonna give you is like hey before it happened thanks a lot so burglars allow me to only speak so remove enough there's reconciliation the only way we can ever come back to God is through the blood of Jesus voila you Anibal hmm yell out that he went when he said he said Jesus the Bible says by one sacrifice once and for all amen amen you don't have to bring any more sacrifices Jesus became our sacrifice ladies alone how we can say Lord we thank you Lord we have the perfect sacrifice amen and we find out that that other sacrifice they have to bring the sacrifice every year that the book of Hebrews chapter 10 tell us that you bring the sacrifice every year make the sacrifice and when they went away they stood it wrong it's still sin right and the fell from grace and every year that to bring the sacrifice but the Bible says for sacrifice so God will not accept any other sacrifice except the blood of the Lamb his son Jesus Christ amen see so that is provided way and many won't accept any sacrifice see if you want to get back to God you gotta look [Music] the model that is preaching they said never a man spake like this man a man and the way conducted himself he never did anything wrong amen how do we know the Prophet tells us yet all the reason to live the way another man looked and dip the wet things that normal men did no but it made the sacrifice see you walk that perfect life he looked at life brings a lot so what's already when he happened to cross there and he died the Bible said there was an earthquake amen amen middle of the day everything went dark amen the rock started growing of the mountains amen the Sun refused to shine [Music] man a man who can receive our Redemption really concerned back to God amen amen see he has done the atonement praise the Lord praise the price for sins by the blood so it frankly and the message God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself okay says here for the love of God constraining us because we thus judge that he won that for home then we all die and then he died for all don't loop on yourself we live for him praise the Lord the Bible tells us we live and we move him amen praise the Lord right wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet man in slop knowing him no more therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature amen raise a lot if any man is in Christ he is a new creature that's Christ and had given to us the ministry not imputing you I don't know if anybody or any fights have a teller step then they can be reconciled by god I wasn't giving his life amen and shedding his blood place the rock that we can be reconciled back to God please look that's what we're doing back to hidden amen Adam lost his rights he forfeited his right a man he was like an amateur God the bound tells us Adam name all the animals a man and and he had control in the Garden of Eden before the fall and then he was in control what have we desired happened but when they disobey God he lost all that everything but thank God we gonna go back to hidden amen back to the restoration power back to sons and daughters of God again amen so our life here is only for the time praise the Lord so we should rejoice coronavirus or no coronavirus not interested God is gone away our life in his hands if you want to take a bite at coronavirus will go up - if you want to take us in the car accident regarding the car accident if you want to take us in a sickness we going to sickness praise the Lord as long as we are given friends a lot so we can't question God amen and we know that happened right through the Bible John the Baptist while Jesus was there he expect Jesus to come please rescue that were even present they were getting prepared to chop his head off but Jesus never went he allows them to cut his head off huh so glad Allah John the Baptist compasses let me cut off and also st. Paul when he went to be clad in row under that great Roman government he finally was put into prison and they chopped his head off but these all were looking to go and be with Christ amen like the Old Testament Saints the Bible says that was used to live hey men they want you to give their life to Christ praise the Lord and we thank God that we have reconciliation and redemption through Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ and the devil Satan knows that for 2,000 years he's been killing Christians for 2,000 years by putting them in prison a man and he's happening stood out in this same tell me whichever religion he is crucified and killed and put into prison because of the faith in Christ even right now China basically designed prison in Iran Christians are in prison in Pakistan Christians on prison yeah they are fighting and you know all the time amen nobody else we find especially in there in the faith of Islam and if a person converts to Christ yet disowned by the parents some of the Mikheil why only for Christianity thanks a lot that's a work of the devil thinking can get rid of the people of God no but god you're a better thing for them amen death is an open door there's a lot through death we enter into life thanks a lot so don't think your life is great now that's the end by death we enter into life amen amen so to a Christian it's a victorious thing to die Amen the Bible clearly tells us if you read the book of Hebrews chapter 11 they refuse to die or to live amen they want you to die they know there's a better life waiting mm-hmm so we are here for a short period of time people are living just past hundred years now but it's still a short time you don't know anybody that lived on 50 years ago huh we don't anybody a man that lived 150 years ago where they can look for that period of time in that day in their age and their 2-1 now God promised here in the last day amen praise love being the last thing lady to see us the last church age Amen Jesus and the gospel must be preached through here then we ensure how many men man prays alone so the gospel is growing all over the world praise the Lord you know sometimes Jesus was they with them in the present they never got the revelation of what was happening he was there talking to them every time telling them parables but they never really understood what was happening amen when Jesus came to their crucial hour he was going to go in there and they're going to come to arrest him he knew the type so he went to the gun dog even Bay I got enough get some money and he called it the sample spray little while and he went to Luc's and then he prayed and he came back he saw them swimming like nothing all day on the road and they were tired they worked for long I was preaching the gospel and that you do get tired so while he came except over there Jesus came Becky woke them up he said what something with you guys right and then he went again and he came back he saw them sleeping again the church was not be sleeping in the shower man we ought to be playing we ought to be trusting God and also in the upper room there they were scared oh you know what they killed Jesus they're going to come to us now let's go in the room and let's hide over there drunk sisters there was scared bunch of people they didn't want to pray but I tell you what the Bible says of their free because the Holy Spirit came like a rushing mighty women and he fooled all of them then they were not scared you know let you do the street preaching the gospel amen they just want to pray now we are trying for godly man now we got the revelation now they were full of the Holy Ghost sympathy from that they were scared bunch of people that preach the gospel so much till they gave their lives a man not one of those disciples except John the Revelator died a natural death every one of them were killed they were martyred every one of them Breslau so if this this way of life was wrong why did they all give their life why didn't they will go back to the families and Jesus called them in Matthew 24 the things that gotta be fallen you know if we are told things like that will say no no no no sorry thanks thanks very much Lisa you're going to killed a man he said you gonna be put into prison he said you gonna be separated from your families huh you mean let me say that look like that I mean ah what is this now I'm gonna be killed crazy and they all die the enemies kill them but maybe the enemy told me kill them but they are all alike hey then the end of day every one of them is alive waiting for us the Old Testament church is waiting for us amen amen after the preach the gospel now that book that was sealed had to be open to show us Redemption plan amen and the promises this seven sealed book is the book of redemption and he says it can only be open yet the last day a man yet to be under the last ministry after the last day messenger the book had to be open to show that it was no church amen he was no denomination he was no baby he was no poop but the lamb step forward he may praise the Lord that the book of Revelation chapter five the lamb step 4 amen hey man and he was bloody raised a lot show him that he paid the price he was the one that's worthy amen and he had to take this back and show us what do you enemy did for 2,000 years killing the Christian fasik making their indulgences grand candles and buy things and and senior property to the church and became there willfully go and commit a murder which is all contrary to the commandments of God so that's where the land at the steps want amen and say I don't work amen I did the work of redemption that time is there from Genesis to Revelation nobody else he did the work so when they got a marriage today my mother don't tell me nothing about Hail Mary Jesus never mentioned anything about his mother nothing see neither said no you're gonna look too baby Mary gonna intercede for you that's a welcome the devil only Jesus Christ amen he did the work of redemption praising I'll be glad for that amen so he says now we have Decimus for Christ as regarded as the God did beseech you must we pray you in God's stead be ye reconciled to God payment for yet made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be the righteousness of God in him amen praise Allah we are perfect but not perfect he Christ me a perfect and then in Christ we are made whole amen say if we are in Christ God sees us as perfect amen rains road through the mud he looks at us as perfect a man God never do things in vain amen he looks through the blood he has made a way for us and the Bible says Satan he's an accuser of the Brethren he goes to God and he accuses us look at your Sunday look at your daughter did this and did that Jesus punch into the blood Amen praise enough says my blood is covered in praise oh I'd be glad for that amen so we are reconciled to God through Jesus Christ raised a lot so that that kind goes right back there - - you can find that in the book of Exodus chapter 12 they had to take a land and slay the Lamb for each household the Passover lamb was called apartheid because during the Passover he was the Lamb of God day amen that was slain right at the time the real name of God was there amen they had to take him and slay him praise the Lord and the Bible says while Jesus was there on their cross who says thank you a man trained by the blood of Jesus Christ he gave his life good things to come see the law was only for sharing all these lambs and any wolves and all was only over having it shouldn't go booth kind of bulls and goats kill take away sin amen so it says here there's nobody come Amen to do your will or God praise the Lord clearly saying sacrifice and offering burnt offerings and offerings of sin you did not desire and no pleasure in them amen which was a future not offered according to the law then he said behold I come to you to do your Will O God it takes away the first that he may establish the second Amen praise the Lord I regret but that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all amen praise Allah perfect and say offered one sacrifice for sins for help say Amen sit down and the light from that time waiting to praise Lord I'll be glad to let a man redemption through the blood there is a lot so we don't have to sacrifice and you know I became a Christian without about twenty-one late twenty twenty-one and before that I should go to the temples the same things all the time that thanks be to

one sacrifice a man once and for all we are the concern back to God and be glad for that amen but the Holy Spirit also witnessed to us for after he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord oh I can't forget and exact with it amen amen like the SEPA gee I find no fault in them if I know for because we are if you see the three days being
