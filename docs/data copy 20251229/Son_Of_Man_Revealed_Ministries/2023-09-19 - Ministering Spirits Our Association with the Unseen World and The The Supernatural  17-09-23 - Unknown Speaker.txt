keep that service in prayer amen I was sharing the testimony about that 82 year old man that got healed and it was in one of those Brothers meetings then he got healed amen amen so if you if you got sick people if you got people that need Deliverance amen God has different Messengers on the earth and he chooses to use different Messengers different Mysteries and different ways and we're so grateful that he's able to come to us because the body needs the fivefold amen amen amen now we are not chasing after gifts if you want to chase after gifts and you go to denominations amen hallelujah amen even if the Lord raises the dead by these hands you don't never look to me that's right amen Christ yes amen amen so never put it upon the person can you imagine the prophet William Branham with all of the miraculous that took place in his life yes you ever heard him Pastor you have an investment thing it's me thank you Lord if anything it made him more humble to say Lord how can you use me amen so no matter what God does with us or through us it is choosing it's his grace we shall never become puffed up if we ever become that way God will kick us to the side yes thank you Jesus amen thank you we always need to remain humble yes yes Amen in humility because what are we Servants of Christ amen so the brother will be on Wednesday so amen and uh so maybe you got somebody that wants to but you say oh but must I bring them just for the healing yes healing is the bait Deliverance is the bait whatever it takes for them to hear the word of the Lord amen hallelujah so amen so that'll be seven o'clock on Wednesday amen so come expecting a blessing and the Lord will bless us amen let's turn to Exodus 23 23. amen just one portion of scripture there and then we'll turn to Genesis 18 10. amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen isn't he worthy of Praise amen amen amen amen so we were looking at the life of Abraham and we were there in Genesis amen chapter 18 and we were watching how the Lord was moving and coming to give them a message of a body change amen and you say Amen to them amen that's why he came to them now the Angels visit was for a dual purpose amen he came with a dual purpose when he came to this denote amen when he came there in Genesis 18 he comes with a dual purpose and it extends into chapter 19 the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah amen so he first comes there we find to Abraham and Sarah and we'll just pick it up as we go so Exodus 23 23 says for mine Angel shall go before thee amen now that was the first Exodus we know the angel of the Lord was in the second Exodus and he's here in the Third Exodus amen so Genesis 18 10 is a type of where we are now and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and Lord Sarah thy wife shall have a son amen and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him amen then we're going to go to Psalm 91 amen Psalm 91 Psalm 91 from verse 9 says because that was made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation therefore shall no evil befall thee neither shall any play Come night thee neither dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee amen to keep thee in all thy ways now many people don't like to quote that scripture because the Satan used that scripture when he took him to the Pinnacle of the Temple and told him but Satan is quoting Psalms amen so people like tend to shy away but what is the word of the Lord telling us he shall give his angels charge over thee amen to keep in all thy ways and they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against the storm so you know there's ministering spirits on the earth yes amen then Psalm 34 verse 7 to 8 Psalm 34 the angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that fear Him and delivereth them oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him amen one more portion of scripture then we can be seated in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 14. amen Hebrews chapter 1 verse 14 reads Hallelujah amen so let's maybe read from 13 to get context he was talking about but to which of the Angels heavy at any time sit at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool right but he's saying now he's talking about the angels are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of salvation amen you may be seated the Lord and blessings to the reading of his word amen Hallelujah no we don't believe in worship of angels but yet angels are sent on the earth as what ministering spirits and to who The Heirs of salvation amen now many times if we are unaware we are not conscious of the fact that angels are around us Angelic beings are in our homes Angelic beings are in the church Angelic beings accompany us wherever we go amen but sometimes we don't even amen consider these things but yet we find when the Lord is coming down in Genesis Chapter 18 where those two are the Angels he is coming to give a specific message to a specific woman amen and what message is it it's a message of a new body it's a message of a body change so you can say it's a body changing message the message is coming from the heavens to the Earth amen amen and he's telling Sarah behold you shall have a son talking about son we forgot to welcome amen our new member of the church Judah let's welcome him give him a hand amen Mr King back let's give Sister Kim back a hand amen hallelujah she looks so excited to be back amen praise the Lord amen so it's been a month already that is here on the Earth amen we pray that the Lord will continue to be with him and bless him amen even as he grows up in the ways of the Lord amen so when the Lord is telling now what she's telling I'm coming again I will return amen you don't read off it again if you follow the chapter you don't find that he returns there's no physical writing or record of it amen but he says I certainly return unto thee according to the time of life amen so it's a secret coming to Sarah alone amen and when he speaks that word it's as good as the spoken word when he says you shall have a son he's just waiting to fix it now and bring it to pass amen so we know that amen the translation the prophet will tell us here the translation of the Bride will be the same thing amen the word that's in you so there the Angels spoke the word into Sarah he says the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same thing did by Sarah amen when that old body that she had that first body it had to be changed in order to produce a son you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed the same way to receive they son amen amen amen now the Lord Jesus Christ wants to be made welcome in our lives amen amen yes amen amen now we find one time Simon invited Jesus to his house and the prophet of God tells us that he got into the house without being made welcome amen he says the Pharisee was too busy he was meeting doctors and the favorite celebrities he had too much to do to see Jesus come in he says I wonder if that isn't the case today if we're not too busy with our profession and other things that we fail to entertain him is that is it that way in your home is it that way at your church is it that way in your life you pray Lord Jesus come and when he comes you don't pay any attention to him you see like even now we sang the songs we did what we could right amen but now that he's here we're not paying attention to him amen so don't let's get caught up in religious performance amen amen let's let's be sensitive to the spirit now let's not be having a religious performance going on here man amen hallelujah because when the spirit of God moves when his power sweeps through this place Anything Can Happen amen yes according to your faith Anything Can Happen thank you Lord right now amen so get that Spirit off of you get whatever is off of you right now and get involved in the spirit of God amen just say Lord come and anoint me now amen many many men amen I sense a lot of distraction in the church hallelujah amen because you know as much as there's Angelic beings there's demonic forces here Abraham you see if we could open spiritualize right now you'll see there's a great war going on there's a fight going on there's Spirits reaching out to connect connect connect so some unbelief amen but the angel of the Lord is here amen yes now remember the Angels Came in Genesis 18. but the demons were already there in Sodom and Gomorrah they came in as an opposing Force they Prophet tells us they came in a time of investigating judgment that's what we've had when the amen the cloud came down they came down the cloud was the weak amen the weaked one which was the judge amen let's just move on here so he says amen if I he says when it come you don't pay any attention to him is that the way you're treating my Lord if it is shame on you if I know he was coming I'd be looking for him watching for him so I could give him courtesy and make him welcome amen yes didn't we see that in Genesis 18 Abraham running to get water in my money to get the lamb Abraham running Amen to fetching bread making him welcome how do I make him welcome well get the Netflix away get the movies away get the pornography away get your nonsense away [Music] amen it's not too hot it's not rocket science you've got to live a pure holy life a clean life amen hallelujah oh I tell you amen we are in a season now where the angels of God need to connect with men amen you didn't hear me amen amen in order for this move of God to move forward the Angelic beings that are here on the earth now need to connect with men and women of God you think the Angels Came there without connecting with Abraham and Sarah come on now you're reading it in the Bible they're coming to the Earth to connect with men amen the prophet tells us look where Abraham was sitting he was sitting by the tent door he says but if you look at a lot you are sitting by the gate amen so when he went to meet lot he had to meet him at the gate you know the gate is further away but get him to your door oh yes sir amen that's what the prophet is teaching us he says but today we're looking for everything but the Lord we are looking for everything but the Lord that's the reason we miss him and I'm going to show you some of the things the prophet says yet startling and you'll find out how we even miss him even amongst us yeah because his presence is unrecognized amen because we are respecters of persons amen because we don't respect officers right right amen but his presence is unrecognized you see why because he comes and he Tabernacles different men and men have different personalities and because you don't agree with their type of preaching and their type of personalities you're dismissive of them amen he says we're looking for everything but the Lord that's the reason we miss him and there he was unwashed feet sitting back in the crowd in that condition isn't it pitiful but that's the way it was that's the way it is today that's where it's in many of our homes when Jesus comes to your heart do you feel like crying you feel like weeping you feel like praising him even now you feel like doing anything but what do you do with him you put him up in the attic you don't want to be expressive he says oh you take him down in the cellar and you go down there and you say thank you mm-hmm amen he says when the spirit of God is making You Weep when he's making you cry on the inside you are taller praise the Lord amen hallelujah not like I don't want this person to see me raise my hand amen we are not your serving one another we don't care if you raise your hand yes we don't care if you Worship the Lord amen we don't care if we get undignified amen we don't care if you dance in the spirit of God Amen so get beside yourself thank you Lord and when the spirit of God comes upon you then you dance like David in the spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart I will sing like David said amen amen yes amen some of us sing so low amen and so slow amen even the ants can hear us amen hallelujah the prophet you know Allah bring context to a quote the prophet is talking about congregational singing and he says I don't care if you can't carry a tune in a cold bucket he says you sing and you Worship the Lord amen amen yeah now some people have taken that out of context and they make that special items and then what happens they become a spectacles to the people and now they're subject to the service because this person is singing Out Of Tune I'll show you another quote way he says if somebody came singing Out Of Tune he says you'll get to the one in charge and tell them don't let them sing No More because the service must be in order amen so in a congregational sin even if you don't sing in tune sing your heart out to the Lord because singing I'm talking about professionals now is a gift as well it carries an anointing you can't be disruptive to a service and let me tell you something when somebody is singing out of Truth and somebody is singing badly amen nobody's rejoicing out there you're actually dampening the cells okay maybe I just feel that way amen so he says sometimes you feel like weeping feel like crying but you're putting him up in the attic or down in the cellar and you get down there and you whisper thank you Jesus you're ashamed of him before your company right if you are you are to repent today amen amen amen give God first place first place first in your life first your best not your second your first seek ye first the kingdom of God amen I'm not ashamed of the Gospel amen amen I forget the tune amen that my wife was singing last week something about being ashamed amen I'm not ashamed not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen we should never be ashamed you know what he says now but do you let him sit back when you're talking to your boss and Jesus comes down and he wants you to testify who comes down you feel that tag you need to tell this person something amen but you feel a little embarrassed now Jesus comes down and tells you that the love of God's in your heart Are you ashamed of him do you give him a little corner now the question may be asked how do we entertain Jesus you say come Lord Jesus Come into my heart I love you Lord entertain him if someone come at your house and you don't entertain them they wouldn't come many times maybe that's what's the matter tonight maybe that's mental what's around in our homes in our churches we're afraid ashamed to entertain Jesus you're afraid somebody will you say Amen you're afraid to raise up your hands and give him praise you're ashamed because your neighbor's sitting there or somebody else you're ashamed because of your husband or your wife or your son or your daughter because you live like a devil at home and now you're embarrassed because your son's gonna think hey I'm a hypocrite Hallelujah it's not happening here so you should be making noise okay amen I'm just leaving quotes so don't think I'm preaching yeah am I just reading amen you're afraid to raise your hands or shame your neighbor sitting this what do I do about your neighbor worship them why do I care about your neighbor Worship the Lord you asked him you invited him now you all made an effort to dress and come here for an appointment with Jesus now that he's you are here he is here what are you going to do about it amen yes what are you doing about it right now you know if Jesus physically was here which I believe he's physically here through the form of the ministry right now you'll never you you can't tell me to his presence and leave the same way yes amen amen all sickness must leave amen yes I don't know if anybody you know we we got a lot of this in the message where there's Miracles and healings but in the message we only find healings was all Jesus healings in Miracles instant come on now come on people come on come on come on you read your Bible yes know what you read in the Bible there to wait one week two weeks three weeks four weeks five weeks six weeks come on now yes do we want that Jesus was the same yesterday today and forever that's what Jesus I'm after honor yes you will read amen later on how Angels Angelic healing when the angel of the Lord is going sometimes he goes a week later two weeks later amen because he is meeting appointments amen amen but I'm talking about instantly now when the presence of the Lord is here while I'm preaching right now you can be healed but you see you've got to be under that expectation you got to build yourself up to that expectation that while the word of the Lord is being preached I'm being healed because your word says you sent your word and you heal my diseases amen yes Lord thank you Father thank you Lord amen hallelujah he says what we need tonight is an old-fashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place amen yes we should put it up here old-fashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place yes he likes to get down to some humble places amen you don't go to the synagogue in Bethlehem but he went to a humble lowly Manger wonderful thank you amen now yeah we come to ministering Spirits amen he says we still have Angelic beings as ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God so God is always an Angelic beings to one the world I believe this Angel Angelic beings in the Earth today and are warning the world of judgment to come I could go a little bit on your flying saucer yeah just a few minutes but I don't want to take your time yeah only if you have seen these videos faster than you can blink your eye that like course gone science is catching up amen hallelujah he says I don't want to get into your flying sauces and things amen but anyhow did you notice before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah that's Genesis 18 now which is the perfect thing God sent down Angels they had to call lot out is that true amen so he says just before the coming of the righteous one just before the coming of Isaac so he's bringing it in time the great Son of God God sent an angel down and that angel come to a home that was a respected home if you want angels to visit your home I mean if you want angels to visit your home okay okay we'll give you an hour to go home first before they come to clean up especially women yo I'm not talking to you now there's no more magazines at all under the bed it's all in your cell phone you might have to burn yourself from before you go throw the cell phone out of the house nobody knows what I'm talking about that's why all your phones are password protected that your wife and your husband can't even see it hello yes we don't think that's true husbands and your phone to your wife wife send your phone to your husbands children and your phones to your parents right now let's go through it your phone should be open access even the kids must be able to use it yeah amen I said even the kids must be able to use it man ah I got this ghost picture let me delete it one more time you know sometimes someone show you photos on your on their phone must watch how they watch you like don't ever swipe left or right I didn't tell you swipe left or right and the search is you know I'm telling you there are demonic forces on the earth now that have come to influence you young men young women time to influence you with the things of the world amen we talk about idols you know they are modern day idols and they get a bit messy amen Messi's and Ronaldo's and Salah Salah is praying to Allah but you love Salah hey that's your Idol you see why Angels can't come there because you're watching soccer so the angel wants to come to your house not to watch Premier League the angel is not coming to watch the Premier League by your house or Champions League what's our local League here [Music] I don't know what it is amen believe me the angel of the Lord don't like Sundowns and Kaiser Chiefs amen but yet hey you saw my shirt how come I don't see you you try to impersonate the team right that's why you're wearing the shirt or you're the supporter of the team I'll come out when I come visit you don't have Angels means walking around because now you're impersonating the angels hey waiting for Angelic visitation you say angels on it yes they have

vixir amen they can sow your angel's wings you can pretend amen now we we got I'm talking about modern day idols modern day Idols you know who your Idols are amen you know what they are amen so they come if you want angels to visit your home be like zechariah's home imancero was living upright before the Lord keeping all the statutes and Commandments of the Lord living in perfect obedience to the word in the light that they had I want you to know as we get deeper into these things we are not sure to kick the message of the hour aside yes amen we are here to promote the entire message we're here to present the revelation of the word yes amen because when the Seven Angels Came Down they came with a message amen yes the same message that they came to Abraham and Sarah amen amen so in our building up in our basic preaching don't think that we're here to sideline the message of the hour because rapturing faith lies in the message that came after 63. yes and somebody say Amen the seals were not open for nothing amen amen all the opening of the word didn't come for nothing yeah otherwise you are not going to take a rapture he says all this time I've been waiting for a message waiting for a message waiting for a message I waited to connect I went I went West to connect with the angels amen amen Hallelujah yeah very briefly now the prophet will tell us Daniel had an angel when he was praying for revelation of the word Daniel had an angel he'll tell you that Mary was visited by an Angel Philip at the Holy Ghost but the angel told him to go to the desert yes right Peter had the Holy Ghost but he was in prison and they were praying down at John Mark's house and the angel of the Lord set him free from all the chains amen and he let him loose from the prison and he comes knocking on John Mark's house amen Paul the Apostle had the Holy Ghost amen amen and yeah they stranded on a ship and he has a message from the Lord to tell them for they stood by me this night an angel of God whose I am and whom I serve that no arm shall come to us amen the angel of the Lord is here on the earth now amen praise the Lord he says and angels are sent from his presence ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God do you understand amen amen that God never takes his Spirit from the Earth oh this ought to make us rejoice amen you mean the same angel that let Peter Paul and and all the early disciples is here now yes and he hasn't lost any power right he hasn't aged a bit amen amen it's not like a female angel this Angel is a strong Angel the Bible calls him a mighty Angel amen amen Hallelujah praise the Lord God takes his man but never his spirit if I were you I'd be saying Lord if your spirit is here I wanted now if your angel is here I want to connect with him now amen yes Lord that's the attitude we should be having amen God taking Elijah but the spirit of Elijah came on Elisha then several hundred years later it came on John the Baptist The Same Spirit made him act the same way and then it prophesied that it'll be again in the last days God takes his man but his Spirit remains and William Branham is gone off to see him but where is the spirit of

eyes open until your sickness leave yeah amen come on now yes appraisal amen we are not cowards that's just saying a prayer and hoping the confidence in the word of God and who we are praying to and

demonic powers and sicknesses and diseases that Angelic beings cannot possess us yes upper slot you must tell Arthur writers to go after I stayed too long yes amen amen yes amen hallelujah that's right amen and Mata must leave all unbelief yes concerned about many things be a Mary amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen if you can only see the Angelic Warfare going on now amen hallelujah amen that stubborn demon doesn't want to come off you amen hallelujah but by the end of the service amen you shall be rejoicing amen hallelujah [Applause] worshiping the Lord giving him glory giving him Autumn amen amen don't be bound this morning being the son of man [Music] with all men of sicknesses and diseases and you think I must live with this because of all this nonsense yes

all sin cleanse me of all impurities in my body deliver me from all skin problems yes slow hey you've gone very superficially why are you living with demons yes amen now because why because you got a skin problem you got a complex we don't want you to have a complex yes we want you to be delivered amen so we want you to have good blood yes perfect blood yes no impurities in your blood yes amen hallelujah it's all day in the word we just need to take it and apply it I thank you Lord there's cleansing Power in the Blood of the Lamb amen hallelujah therefore I am cleansed I am washed hallelujah amen amen amen amen hold it before you and confess it amen praise the Lord so he tells us so he didn't take his Spirit Away taking his son but his Spirit stayed on the earth the Holy Spirit he sent it back to the air to live among mankind are you conscious of that you see most of us right now we don't really want this teaching we want the servers to finish and we'll go on with our normal lives and never be conscious of the supernatural he says before God sent Jesus to the Earth he sent an angel and an angel came to a home Zechariah and Elizabeth they were renowned believers amen Christians has to call and that's the kind of home that an angel can get to God always had Angels ministering Spirits do you believe it Angels doesn't die what was happening God was just fixing to do something on the Earth so before he always does something he sends an announcement there's Angels come perhaps the Angels visits me visits you and so forth there might be a mining Angels but when you Heir the angel Gabriel coming you take heat something's taking place Gabriel announced the first coming of Jesus and Gabriel will announce the second coming of Jesus Christ is that right have you have you heard Gabriel sound come on now I'm asking you a question if it's recorded in the Bible that Gabriel came to Mary to announce the first coming of Jesus Christ amen amen he says Gabriel will announce the second coming amen now I'm asking you you believe the Lord Jesus Christ will come even now send Gabriel sound yeah well as he already sounded as John the Baptist was sent to forerun my first coming yes down there in 1933 on the Ohio River gonna run quickly before Jesus come and announce age you think Gabriel's gonna say Jesus the Forerunner as John the Baptist was sent to forerun yes the first coming your message the second coming amen amen hallelujah amen I know you know these things you just forgot amen so Gabriel announced the first coming Gabriel will announce the second coming of Jesus I began to feel religious amen and you know what I think today the reason that we don't have no more Angelic visitations that we do we call ourselves Christians and play cards after night read old true story magazines have beer in the ice box and that's the reasons Angels don't visit us you can't mix oil and water praise the Lord amen amen [Music] he says now Angels coming to these homes when they are renowned homes now I know you have renowned homes I know you have strong believers amen then you are ready for Angelic visitation amen amen look at how the prophets approach was he says I desire the prayer of you all that always within my own side Lord keep me little where I can be where he can use me I want to be a place to where when the Angelic beings come out together hello you really don't miss these things now he's saying I want to be to a place to where when the Angelic beings come out together he can say well I know my servant put your name there will mind me amen that's what I want him to do amen praise the Lord oh Hallelujah he's talking about here Babylon the first Babylon number one in the time of nimrod and he says when they had that great conference and made the people of Babylon come in this great Confederation isn't this the same time now look the time of evil going on between the woman sexually and so forth at the same time God had a witness on the earth Enoch who walked with God blamelessly at the same time that evil was appearing Angels appeared on the earth amen [Music] amen now yes where we're trying to get to now Angelic beings Associated together if you've got the holy spirit in your arm if you've got the holy spirit amen watch what he says then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural amen yes I don't know if you want to be connected there's nothing more frustrating than you're getting a cell phone contract and you have no connection yeah when they give you a new contract you must wait 24 hours that 24 hours feel like 24 days or you do a Sim Swap and they tell you it'll be available in four hours especially maybe you're a businessman or you got some you know some importance that you really rely on the cell phone there's no connection he said if you got the Holy Spirit you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural amen amen now don't be don't be associated with the Unseen word I'm talking about demonic world yeah yes because demonic world is also Supernatural we're talking about God Amen when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly it becomes then a truthful being one of the year to die and one of the heaven to live in his body is subject to death but in his soul is fast from Death to unto life in his body he has his Earthly contact with his five senses in his Spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost somebody say praise the Lord amen amen um and the angels of God visit them speaks to them and they are messengers of God from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual now he's talking here about the ministry right he says Daniel when he was closing his ministry there was an angel who followed him and told him you are beloved before God and now Daniel couldn't talk perhaps face to face with God but God sent an angel as an intermediate between him and God Amen that he could talk between them the very word Angels means messenger now I'm not trying to bring anything to me I'm just reading a quote of the Prophet because you need to understand those principles right this can apply to the ministry he says your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he's feeding in the shepherd's place because the word passed him in Shepherd look it up and find out if it ain't right if Pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock to feed them with what the word of God let's follow now you see now he's talking about how we are made right so we know we are a three-part being so in your body inside of you we gotta he says inside of you is a spirit another man the outside of you is one man the inside of you is another man so the inside of you is the supernatural amen thank you amen um if you know your five senses can't think it's a spirit man that does the thinking yeah the spirit man that does all the action that conveys it to this body right the inside of you is another man the inside of you Supernatural the outside of you is the physical if you are Spirit led by God you become a messenger of God amen amen om hello God's messenger God's angel is the very same word can't separate it God's messenger or God's angel he has a very powerful one he's asking does an angel from heaven have Authority or the angel at the pulpit what are you saying and which aim and which has the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel like the pulpit which has it he says the angel at the pulpit amen Paul said if an angel from heaven comes down and preach any other gospel to you then this which I have already preached let him be accursed so the angel anointed of the Holy Spirit and with the word stand next to who you see most times we become respecters of person now you ask yourself right you judge because you've had two pastors right the way you talk to me or the way you interact with me will you interact that way with Pastor Ronnie just ask yourself so we become respecters of persons we may be all wanting more High regarding the other but is it the same office amen he says the angel at the pulpit is more powerful than the angel from heaven amen amen maybe maybe a Bitcoin descending to because somebody is younger maybe you not have the same I am just talking because it could be the way you've had a transition sometimes it's easier to respect the older person than a younger person but what am i showing you the man anointed the man Anointed The Prophet says even if you disagree with the man he said you respect that office yes amen that's right and that just goes beyond this uh pastorship yeah any of the faithful Ministry you watch how you speak to them yes you watch how you address them yeah because what are we reading all of you these people are connected with the angel of God they're connected here now if you could only open your eyes in the spiritual and see them connected you think you'll approach him the same way talk to them the same way you won't he says if an angel comes from Heaven to preach any other gospel to you then which I've already preached let him be accustomed so the angel Anointed with the Holy Spirit and with the word stands next to God Amen amen praise the Lord yeah he goes on again Angelic beings is ordained ministers of God to come to the Earth to Bear record of God and they work through just as it did through Daniel and back through the ages now he's trying to reveal himself today to the sick and to the needy in the form of an Angelic being coming down like he did in the pool of Bethesda but upon mankind to reveal himself by showing signs and wonders let me show you how powerful this concept is if a minister is not connected with the Supernatural and with the move of God you know the pastor can control the service right now I can close the service flat sing one song Pray and go home I can kill the move of God right here I can have no vision for the church I can have no vision for you I can be selfish because the pastor controls the what goes on in the spiritual services so if he is not connected that is why the prophet of God says you can't live higher than your pastor because your pastor is feeding you amen and is highly revelated as he is you can only live up to that revelation that's why he says pray for your pastor amen that the Lord will increase his wisdom and understanding and give him revelation of the word because you are being fed from the pastor now some of us I must say this some of us feed the body three times a day fled the spirit man you feed once a week hello we dedicate ourselves to feed the flesh three times a day two times a day how many times a day but the spirit man sometimes you don't even come to church so the spirit man is only eating fortnightly the spirit of man is eating once a month the spirit man needs a Salvation Army it needs resuscitation the spirit man needs to go on trips amen because we are starving it amen I need to bring this to a close now amen hallelujah but the spirit man that's in tune with God that if you speak to this mountain yes the spirit man that's in tune with God that has the faith of God if you say to this mountain yes and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said yes it shall come to pass amen yes amen amen praise the Lord that's right praise the Lord thank you let's go to the next one why I just want to go through this very quickly I may not read all of it the minister now is talking about and he says the ambassadors of the throne absolutely an ambassador of the Christ as Authority everything that Christ owns belongs to the Ambassador the old powers of Heaven is right in your hands oh where do we sit the church is Barren and we accept dormant is because we don't recognize these things amen and right we said their demonic forces coming to block he says when Satan is trying to block you from something that's right keep on going regardless Satan was trying to block Abraham and Sarah because he knew there was Angelic visitation coming and then when everything Rises all out of your order then we know something's wrong now I believe maybe if we would listen to Satan we'd miss seeing it like Sarah did you watch that is why sometimes you know as ministers some of you probably know what I'm talking about it's not that we are trying to be different we are trying to protect the anointing amen so even on the way to church we may not want to have much conversation because we are human beings right you could say something or I could say something that maybe we didn't mean to say but then it interrupts the entire atmosphere now maybe I get upset too you get upset now there's a inference in the spirit now we we enter the entire move of God just because of that right so that is why the prophet of God says that the minister should come into the room and just be there meditating amen praying and getting ready for the song leader to call him out amen Hallelujah now I want to stop right there because there's so much more to go through amen Hallelujah maybe let's just go through this while we're on this point because I don't want to come back to this he says yeah in slide 31 you see what kind of homes that Angels come to is homes that trust God don't matter what kind of a home it could be just as long as you trust God whether it's a little humble or whatever it is if you just trust God that's all right that's the reason the Angels don't visit the churches the reason Angels don't visit homes we've got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing the angels of God on Earth tonight just the same as they always been yes amen there's righteous people walking in all the light of the Lord that's the kind of home that God can get into now if you're serving all kinds of parties and beers and everything in your house God will never visit you there yes but if you've got a home cleaned up and living for God with prayer and the Bible open and a few tear stains on it God can visit you because you've opened up a channel that he can come to and there is where it is yeah what the prophet is praying now and you thinking hey you you're telling me that the yeah the prophet is asking angels to go for May the angels of God come down into the City and the cities around throughout the country visit homes stir people Grant your lord yes amen amen are you telling me that I can uh pray for an angel to come go for it I prayed many times Lord send your angel touch and deliver and heal and you watch the angel of God Goes Forth amen amen amen now the prophet is saying May the angel of God go to the country visit home stop people granted Lord may they be an old-fashioned Revival begin to move Lord that you'll just continue on and on and on and I pray that you'll send the Holy Spirit The Immortal angels from the celestial Realms of glory and may they take their positions tonight at every Row in the building in the balcony on the floor on the platform may they speak to the people's heart as Messengers ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God amen he says God still has Angels they visit the people not worship of angels but Angelic beings who are attributes of God send forth to minister to the church through the people or how short are we of real Apostolic church today of the blessing amen amen amen let's just stop there I want to close with this people were skeptical about Angelic visitation and Angelic association with the prophet and when he told them that the angel of God came to me in the cave and out of this ball of light step to 200 pound man and he told me that I was to take the gift of healing to the Nations they didn't want to believe him in fact he went and he told his Baptist pastor and his Baptist pastor laughed at him told him maybe you had something yeah eat something you mean you why would God angel of God come to you mean he bypass all these theologians yes yes and he come to you meet you in a cave he says yes and then you know he was preaching and he had to end in his solution yeah right to connect with the angel of God but in 1950 all of that changed foreign all this time from 19 he met the angel in the cave in 1946 yeah 1950 there was physical evidence to go to slide number 48. there was meetings taking place amen in Houston Coliseum brother Branham was having a Revival and him and every Bosman were hosting these meetings yes and they were having it in such a Auditorium and on January 20th they were moving it to the Coliseum the Sam Houston Coliseum amen if you can see down there can you see the crowd of people yes yes right so this was a big Coliseum but you know if you go to the next slide there was a Baptist cleric who put out a challenge and he was a pastor in Houston and he was upset that these men of God were coming with the message of Divine Healing and Healing The Sick he probably felt threatened by position yes amen amen and the Baptist living began to challenge these miracle workers he called him he called him Miracle Man amen so he began to say things against him and you know how the prophet relates it amen many of you familiar with the message you'll know how if your boss would say we ought to go up there and say something he's challenging us the prophet says I'm not going to debate and fuss then brother told him okay I'll do it in a civil war one yeah I won't do all of that the prophet says well if you go you're going to do that then it's fine amen but yeah The Showdown came yeah you had FM Boswell you had William Branham and Satan said his best what's his name yes what's his initials they thought we are the best his initials is we was telling everyone we best some of you didn't get it they thought they were the best in the city Satan sent his best little did he know that's God's best was on Earth amen yes amen amen he was the Baptist champion amen he was he was telling them that the healings now there's a whole article there that you can read you probably won't be able to read it here but so January 20th is the day they're going to start the meetings at the Coliseum and the expecting thousands and thousands of people to come and be here so they are expecting this meeting to take place so they decided seeing that we're having it in Sam Houston Coliseum with all the debate there all the debates in the morning amen and I think the debate lasted for like four hours and they told the people now every Boston was a smart he started to use the audience as testimony of the healings that God was doing in the meetings amen so they asked the audience every time they agreed with either minister they either said no or they said amen so brother would come and he would ask him and if you've been healed in the meetings and he says Andrews would stand up so just for this meeting alone 8 000 people came to the debate all right eight thousand came and even the sick came because they were expecting to be healed amen hallelujah you go to the next picture here you'll see Dr best and there's where the boss was sitting there can you see that and now he's like pointing to him and every time if you read the article it became so heated that the fight broke out at the bottom there between two ministers yeah you see the guy got his court he had to take off his coat and he was looking for the one who hit him and they were fighting amen so brother this best he is a complaint was the god doesn't work in the same Apostolic way men can't heal but the prophet of God comes in the end and he settles it by telling them I never claim to heal anyone all right you see there would be a great problem in the message today the brother Branham was still alive hmm because most people would be looking to William Branham for the healing and not to Jesus Christ yes it seems like man always wants to look to another man and that's a denominational idea so while they were doing this they hired photographer and he took pictures and he went and he developed those pictures after the meeting and he says the first one came out blank and the next five so if the first one came out blank and the next five so six came out blank but he says when I pulled out the seventh one amen oh yes hallelujah thank you Lord connection with the supernatural amen amen now they took it to yeah what the prophet says now he says God will testify this in fact this was the prophet's last closing words he said God will testify I shall say no more and he didn't even know the light was there amen the prophet closed that Thing by saying God will testify I shall say no more right so he says here Mr kipperman's associate quickly went to work developing the pro the the photographs he noticed something odd as he drew the first photograph from developing solution it like the next five was blank he grabbed his ass and fell forth and when he pulled the last which was the seventh from the solution there on the photograph was the pillar of fire in a visible form resting over the head of God's Prophet William Marion Branham right here is the actual document I don't think you'll be able to read it but this is the official report that George J Lacey wrote The Examiner of question documents now these people who don't believe the sign they call themselves believe the sign they don't believe the sign they are putting it up now that this was a light in the building now you're telling me this FBI agent Mr hey it was Gordon Lindsay who took the photograph and presented it to George Lacy and Tony please investigate this picture look at the negative tell me if it's been tampered with tell me if anything has been done to this thing so if you read the report it'll tell you the exact process and procedures they've done and he ends it by saying based on the above description describe examination and study I am often different opinion that the negative submitted for examination was not retouched nor was it a composite or double exposed negative but we got some internet detectives wasn't even there you think was it wouldn't have told every brand before there was light above your head hey he says further I am of the definite opinion that the light streak appearing above the head in the Halo position was caused by light striking the negative now the accused the prophet of saying in Psychology and he told the prophet that the camera can't photograph psychology so a supernatural being was there so we are in contact with Angelic beings right here where the Prophet would summarize it by saying now I say this with humbleness I say this with pride I see this posting all of you all are false God is only moving through me I say this with humbleness and with reference to him who is present that is the light that I have seen that was the light way over my cradle when I was born that's a light from there came a voice and talked to me down through my life that stole things by the hundreds of things and search out anyone you wish to from Africa around the world in my own city doctors attorneys Wherever You Wish and see if you ever one time it failed to be exactly what he said it was that's what speaks here at the platform not your brother did we just establish now that angelic spirits come to anoint the ministers he says that's the one that speaks now not your brother amen now I believe with all my heart how many of you knows that there was a pull of fire that followed the children of Israel that guided them in the wilderness I don't know if he knows that was Jesus Christ the Christ the angel was the Covenant your teachers and when he was you on Earth he was the same God so every Exodus must have the association with the Unseen World every Exodus yes amen now you've experienced a supernatural in your life and maybe you haven't been conscious that it was ministering spirits that he was like Angelic beings you've had 40 Years of preaching however long you've been in the message of the hour you've been impacted by the preaching your lives have been changed amen what is it you think you're listening to words of man you think words of man can change people like that it's ministering spirits it's the Holy Spirit anointing men and men have different diversities of gifts if you read First Corinthians chapter 12 you'll read how they are diversities of gifts in the body and there's a quote which ties up with First Corinthians chapter 12. that the body is fitly framed together and by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body now I cannot expect you know sometimes people may misunderstand this we preach it in such a way that all of you will be doing the same things but the toe cannot perform like my thumb the tongue all have different functions push it that way because we want you to find your place and your position [Music] some of you may have a position of an intercessor some of you may have the position amen where you can fast some of you have the position where you can pray long hours some of you may have diversities of gifts but it is needed in the body and when the body comes together it is fatally friend everyone functioning everything functioning perfectly then there's external organs and then there's internal organs all part of the same body the prophet would say they ask him in question and answers will everyone heal will everyone be able to speak he says no he says as God gives it lets it out amen has God position his body and framed his body he says you operate in your position you can't be a one dollar bill if he's made you a 50 cents that's what he's teaching us he says otherwise you become an impersonator now we don't want to impersonate nothing yes and say you know I'll try and be like a prophet and try to operate a gift of discernment amen I'm not a prophet the angel didn't come to me and tell me that I'll have a gift like this amen I need to be true to who God made me to be true to God who God made you to be and never tried to impersonate nothing amen when the spirit of God moves you'll know it amen like what you've seen the spirit of God has moved in your life and look at the miraculous that has taken place in your life yes thank you who did it I don't know if you can boasted you didn't how if you can boast it you have one thing to do with it you know if I could heal you I'd heal every one of you amen or maybe if I'm selfish and I don't like him maybe you are one here but that's based on humanneness amen but the power of God is not like that God is not a man his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts amen so we should always always say Lord It's Your Grace towards me that you choose to use me in this measure amen it's the grace of the Lord it's the grace of the Lord that you and I see the message of the hour we must never forget that did he not say that we are saved by grace through faith it's first his grace first his grace amen Hallelujah so we have an association with an Unseen World we have the association with the Angelic world the angels that came to Abraham and Sarah that day are the same Angels that's here on the earth now right between the second war and the third world he says there are three Angels message going forth now the third world the cycle of it has already started yes amen you know what sapping between Russia and Ukraine actually because of the years that have passed Russia has developed in a messed a massive amount of bombs and ammunition and and weapons and they've never been able to test it because they're never in a war and America was always wondering what kind of Weaponry they have and whether they'll be able to fight them so they have used Ukraine as the battlefield so Russia is testing out their best military equipment there and whose military equipment do you think is being used to counter it's the USA's because now for the first time they can actually see if they send a missile can we send an opposing one to actually it's like what they call it military exercise a proxy war being fought USA exercising the power amen what you are seeing is Bible prophecy yes yes amen amen I don't know if you think they're all just going to back up and go home amen so it's building up to something just like how the Lord is building us up to something amen then we always want to stay humble want to stay submitted to the Holy Spirit want to stay submitted to one another and say Lord help us amen it can be so close because remember to be so close that you will deceive the very elective possible now we don't want to get deceived by carrying ons and imaginations amen remember when when uh was it Martin that wanted to move with the spirit of God did an angel come before him and say I am Jesus worship me so you got to be able to have discernment not to associate for the wrong Unseen World check it out by the word is this a move of God is this how you're moving God Amen amen with that said let's stand let's just be reverent in his presence amen we have an association with the Unseen World and I believe even right now they are here they've been sitting and listening the same Angels Wayne Brennan's meetings amen the same angel of God is here same Angel was there with the Apostle Paul with Peter the same Angel was there in the first Exodus same angels went down to Sodom and Gomorrah amen the same Angels meant to Abraham and Sarah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you glory be to his name thank you Jesus thank you Lord we are standing on Holy Ground amen yes yes I know
