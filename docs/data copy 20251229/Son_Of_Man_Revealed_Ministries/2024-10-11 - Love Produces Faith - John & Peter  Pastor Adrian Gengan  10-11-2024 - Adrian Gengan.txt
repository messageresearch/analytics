our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen before you get seated turn to your brother and sister greet them welcome them in the house of the Lord say God bless you good to see you amen praise the Lord amen amen so brother Sunny is not sure he's preaching at at a church in shellcross this morning amen the church he's been witnessing to this brother and uh they've invited him to come and share the word of the Lord amen and we are praying amen that the word of the Lord will find an Abiding Place even if it's just one seed amen praise the Lord so amen we are remembering our brother there also amen I believe sister elen is in Johannesburg amen so she'll be I'm not sure when she's coming back but we pray the Lord will be with her amen and I pray amen everybody is feeling good in the house of the Lord amen blessed in the house of the Lord let's turn to our Bibles amen even as we welcome you in Jesus name amen we're in part three of our message I'm not someone who normally does series but I had to lay a foundation amen sometimes you got to lay the mechanics before the Dynamics come amen amen and the the heart of this teaching is to equip the man Sons and Daughters of God so that we can Ascend higher dimensions in the Holy Ghost amen we can't be operating with the full opening of the word and still be a powerless Church be nothing like what brother grham said this church would be something is wrong there amen so we are looking into the word and the Holy Spirit is guiding us through the word to show us certain truths about what kind of people we ought to be amen so we were speaking on a three-dimensional being Faith open charity which was the essence of love everybody remember that amen and then last week we took amen we took on faith hope and charity and showed you how it was typed in Peter James and John amen so this morning we're going to look at love produces Faith John and Peter John being the Apostle of love and Peter being the Apostle of faith Faith amen amen let's turn to 1 Corinthians 13:13 1 Corinthians 13:3 says and now abideth faith hope charity which is love these three but the greatest of these is Charity amen now abide it faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity amen then we're going to get to where we want to get this morning in Acts chapter 3 praise the Lord so that is our foundational scripture there in 1 Corinthians 13:13 so it's not us declaring that love is a higher dimension of the Holy Ghost it's the Bible that's telling you amen that love is a higher Dimension the greatest of these is love so we are in Acts chapter 3 now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's home was carried whom they laid daily at the temple at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple we seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked and arms and Peter fasting his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave eat unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength amen and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God and they knew that it was that it was he which set for arms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen we have our notes brother Josh amen so very quickly I just want a background I might take maybe 5 minutes just to hit our highlights amen of what we've been saying because sometimes we tend to forget these things it's not because that we are forgetful it's just that the human mind is like that sometimes amen so we are speaking this morning on love produces Faith amen we were looking at John and Peter the Apostle of love and the Apostle of faith and brother Bram says we we're reestablishing this and maybe it's a good catch up to because brother Kenny Miss some Services wasn't you I believe you were working so it'll be a good catch up for him as well amen so brother Grom says that Faith open charity are not three different things but all the essence of one amen love amen praise the Lord now in our human body we don't see all the out the functions of every member of our body most of the time when somebody's speaking you look at their face so the face becomes a thing that you focus on but yet it takes the entire body to function amen amen like the brain is hidden but the brain is sending all of these signals and speech everybody understand so what when you are seeing love it is inside of it is Faith open charity amen and then we were telling us telling you how we are a three-dimensional being that the flesh is Hope amen uh faith is in the spirit realm but love is in the realm of the Soul amen and we were telling you how we were made in the image of God which is the nature the character the essence of God and God is love so we can't be anything else beside love amen amen when the image is being restored in this time and season we must be everything that love is amen amen so brother brandom again I told you for this five minutes I'm just recapping he says what we need is hope faith charity hope faith charity together God help our church to have it like that the people to have that combination amen he says if you can have faith and hope and love you're near the kingdom of heaven then the three great things God taken those as a confirmation because in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word of God be established then again it representing the placing of a son so we also learning that Faith open charity must be there at our adoption ceremony brother BR just confirming it's represented in the placing of a son Peter James and John were taken to Jesus adoption ceremony amen here he says those three elements the sufficient elements to work out every problem the church has you let Faith open charity get in among the people in a church and watch what takes place amen so Faith open charity can work out every problem I say not only in the church but even in your own lives amen if you can use amen this this powers of Faith open charity brother brandom is saying it'll work out every problem in the church he says he manifested his son before all these great elements telling you that he took up Jesus transfigured him before Faith open charity amen if you're reading it say amen amen now I want you to notice under the cloud was three others Moses Elijah and Jesus three is the confirmation confirms anything amen so that's our recap of some of the highlights we were touching on Amen showing you the importance of faith hope and charity in the lives of an individual amen amen praise the Lord now we want to go to our first quote this morning in perfect faith and showing you because we know that Faith cometh by the hearing of the word everybody agree Faith cometh by the hearing of the word so let's hear what brother brandom is saying when you got Pure un adulterate Faith Like Your Love Is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act amen you ain't complaining no more you know it's done just walk along no matter what the thing looks like what anybody else says you know what's happened you know that it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband as well as you know you love probably wants to say your wife see love and faith has to go together they kin folks they love because love produces Faith amen amen so then what is this word that we are listening to because if the Bible is saying Faith cometh by the hearing of the word and brother Bram is saying that love produces his faith then the word has to be a word of love because God is love and and God is no different to his word amen amen so we are finding that this love is producing this Faith within us now remember we can have faith without love and that puts us in the category of Lord we we cast out devils in Your Name Lord we prophesied in Your Name Lord we did many great miracles in your name Jesus says depart from me you workers of iniquity why they didn't have the key ingredient to produce Faith which was love am amen Faith must be based upon the word of God so brother Bram again says the life in the tree produces apples the life in the tree is what produces the apples so it's love in our hearts that's got to produce Faith amen he says brother Brandon do we should we speak with tongues absolutely that's gifts of God but those gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God so we don't want to have outward manifestations gifts of the Spirit and not accepted by God praise the Lord amen this has to be first and when you have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he seals the church age as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam a rip from the side here is the right here is the things that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them they've got to be God sent and God born imitation causes confusion amen amen so we can't have a message church that's an imitation of the message church amen now remember you must see the manifestation of it praise the Lord amen one more quote before we get into some nuggets here he says the old Christian armor is looking at the Unseen but the senses don't declare those things but they're there that's the reason it takes Faith to believe and it produces in you what faith has declared is out there it brings it to you Divine Healing and things they can't prove what heals divinely but they know there is Divine Healing they can't prove what saves from sin but they know people are saved from sin so it cannot be proven scientifically but it is scientifically in God's way of looking at it so faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen is what we are saying amen praise the Lord now if you notice what brother brandham says that he seal the age with a virtue amen now I want you to know if you are still manifesting brotherly love you need to come up higher because leosia was sealed with that virtue but the bride is no longer under Lan Church age can I get somebody to say amen amen amen if you're sitting under a latan church age and a lan spirit this morning we need to pull you out into the bright age it's the age of love it's a manifestation of God Almighty in and through a people amen amen so when we are looking at Peter and John you may be asking you saying that's faith and charity but they are just showing you the foundation and The Headstone but in between all of that he's lying all seven virtues you are just looking at the legs and you're looking at the air when these two are walking together praise the Lord what is that Faith walking with love praise the Lord amen so we're reading here in the Bible and we are finding that Peter and John just get back to my notes amen praise the Lord when we are looking at Peter James and John how they were a part of Jesus in a circle how many if you remember that Jesus took them into special occasions amen they were called apart for special occasions Peter James and John and Jesus surrounded himself with Peter James and John even in his most important and crucial hours amen so Peter represented Faith James hope and John love charity but locked up in Jesus was the fullness of faith hope and love amen he was the Perfection of faith hope and charity now we notice here I'm going to preach these things because we lay down these foundations now that Jesus only changes three of his disciples names he changes the name of Peter which was Simon amen hallelujah he changes the names of James and John they were called the Sons of zebede but he renames them bonus which means the sons of thunder and it will take these seven Thunders Amen to give the bride Faith amen James and John amen hallelujah praise the Lord so he changes only these three why they are representing Faith open and charity and Jesus is the manifestation of God in flesh so the book is in Jesus so he knows their true character their true identity so he renames them to reflect the Heavenly pattern what they were supposed to reflect on the earth amen cuz your name represents your character right amen praise the Lord so only Faith open and charity receives a new name now remember we said it's one unit and who receives a new name in this hour amen the bride will receive a new name amen praise the Lord so we notice that Jesus Takes Peter I'm going to recap here again for those of you that are not following Peter James and John jesus takes them into the house of Jus that's right and he cast out all unbelief why perfect love will cast out fear amen so when they step into the house all unbelief must leave the house yes amen amen in order to see the miraculous you've got to create the expectation for the miraculous there's got to be no room for doubt no room for fear amen yes expectation breeds a miracle amen even this morning if you expect if you have the expectation in your heart amen you can create the atmosphere for your Miracle this morning amen but you've got to breed it amen you've got to create the atmosphere for it amen praise the Lord amen so what he is showing you here when he takes Peter James and John now remember resurrection of the Dead is no easy thing it takes perfect Faith yes amen so Jesus Takes these three Peter James and John and he takes them to to make them be Witnesses of the resurrection of this girl amen showing us that in the end time it'll be Faith open charity in The Believer again that will witness the resurrection of the sleeping Saints amen amen praise the Lord so Peter James and John are also taken up to the mountain to witness Jesus adoption ceremony amen it is year that the the Lord God says amen this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear he him Peter James and John were taken to the most important Supernatural events because it was showing us that when the Romans 8 man is on the earth at the time of the adoption of Sons and Daughters of God faith hope and charity will be in a people who will be adopted amen yes amen praise the Lord because it is a complete unit so Peter James and John were also the ones you can read it in Mark Mark 13:3 Peter James and John take Jesus alone privately and they ask ask him these questions tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled and he is now answering Peter James and John he's revealing the Hidden Mysteries to only that unit amen amen go and read it Mark chapter 13 it's these three that take Jesus aside Peter James and John so he's revealing the Hidden Mysteries only to Peter James and John faith hope and charity and remember we said it's one unit I'm going to repeat myself so until you get it amen it is also Peter James and John that Jesus asked to go and prepare the Passover you'll read that in Luke CH 22:8 the Last Supper Jesus asked Peter James and John to go Peter and John to go and prepare the Passover praise the Lord in the final hours of Gethsemane Jesus Takes Peter James and John to pray but they fell asleep at the darkest and most agonizing hour of Jesus life he takes Peter James and John but I want you to know it was Peter and John now that are the first disciples you can pick this up in John chapter 20 verse one amen it says early on the first day of the week while it was still dark Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance so she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple the one who Jesus loved somebody tell me who that is his name is John so she comes running to Peter and John to tell them that the Lord is risen then they had taken the Lord out of the Tomb and she said we do not know where they have put him then Peter and the other disciples set out for the tomb the two were running together what is it showing you the complete unit from Faith to charity is going to meet the resurrected Lord Jesus amen when you see these two operating together you are seeing the complete Church you are seeing the complete statue of a perfect man hallelujah amen they were running together but the other disciple John out runs Peter and reach the tomb first because love must produce [Music] Faith love has got to reach the tomb first and let me tell let me advise as church love has got to reach every situation we Face First amen amen yes Hallelujah in every circumstance that we face if we let love rule that situation you watch the kind of fight that is produced over that situation fight becomes the spokesperson yes but behind it is love that's generating that Faith amen thank you Lord praise the Lord amen so so love outruns Faith and reaches the tomb first he bent down and looked in at the linen clothes right lying there but he did not go in you see love makes the way for Faith to go in who didn't go in John but who went in Peter so isn't that the case in most of our Lives we see somebody operating in faith and all we can see is their faith but the secret behind that faith is the love operating in high dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord amen we find also in Acts chapter 8 verse1 14 when the Evangelist philli is having a great Revival and The Souls of the city of Samaria are being saved the disciples hear about this revival and who do they send they send Peter and John these these people that were being baptized needed something more than just water baptism and the Bible says that they sent Peter and John to Samaria and they laid hands on them and when they laid hands they received the Holy Ghost yes amen praise the Lord so water baptism alone is not good enough faith and charity must follow in order for the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord now the you know it's recorded in the Bible that from Peter James and John the first disciples to be killed the first disciple to be killed was James we'll read that in Acts 12 so hope he taken off the scene amen praise the Lord and I would like to suggest to you that when the disciples were sent two by two one represented love and the other represented Faith how many of you know that the disciples were sent out two by two one represented love and one represented Faith praise the Lord amen why one represented love the other represented Faith amen and together this was the most powerful force and when they were when love and and Faith were operating and moving they were meeting the Hope in the person what is hope it's the expectation it's the desire yes so hope was now in a people but they had to look on faith and charity praise the Lord amen amen so that's where that's where we get to now as my opening to Acts chapter 3 and we see Peter and John open the book of Acts and Acts chapter 3 is the first recorded Miracle of healing amen we know Acts chapter one jesus takes him up on a mountain he is translated and he commissions them amen Acts chapter two we know they get into the upper room 120 of them and they are waiting there in expectation we know the Holy Ghost comes in Acts chapter 2 3,000 souls are saved but the first miracle of the church this powerful Church filled with the Holy Ghost is in Acts chapter 3 and it forms the basis of how the the the world is going to react the religious realm are going to react and the church is going to react you find this this thing rocks the church World it rocks the religious realm and it rocks even the political because they thought when they put Jesus to death that was done with this kind of movement yes but now they had found Jesus was back but his name wasn't Jesus his name was Peter and his name was John and they wondered we thought we put to death this Spirit but if the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you it will also Quicken your mortal body to do the very works of Christ amen so they were looking in amazement here if you read the chapter at now Jesus in another form oh yes and remember what brother brand is teaching us if you're looking for him in another manifestation another form you're going to miss him you've got to recognize him in the way he's manifesting himself now present tense so don't look at the veil look Beyond the Veil amen amen praise the Lord so this is no ordinary miracle that takes place in chapter 3 and it occupies chapter 3 and chapter four two chapters it takes up amen hallelujah because like we're saying yeah they shake the Realms of Jerusalem they're shaking the Demonic world because the spirit had to leave this lame man it shakes the religious world that they have performed councils now to now check what's going on and it shakes up the religious world the political world and it shakes up the church yes amen these men are full of the Holy Ghost they heal a man who was crippled from birth amen praise the Lord amen amen in fact the Bible records it you can probably pick it up here Amen in Acts chapter 4 just pick it up very quickly Acts chapter 4: 22 there we just want to show you the age of this man the man was above 40 years old whom this miracle of healing was showed pay attention now how old was the man 40 years old how old was Jesus when he died so was this man sitting there when Jesus walked past yes you say how can you say that am man let's show you how I can say that because here in Acts chapter 3 what is he saying Acts chapter 3 tells you that they laid the Man daily at the temple hello amen amen maybe some of them want to seat in the Bible amen praise the Lord Acts chapter 3 verse two I think it is it says and a man who was lay from his mother's wom was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful To Us arms of them that entered into the temple how many of you know Jesus entered the temple many times and if they laid him daily there would this man have been there yes amen but I know Jesus was operating and say John 5:19 the son can do nothing but what he see the father do amen and what the father show the son that do the son likewise so Jesus knew being amen God in flesh he would have known this is not for my Miracle I've got to wait amen for the appointed time when the Holy Ghost is sent back it's going to be the first miracle amen that the church is going to have amen wonderful so he's 40 years old amen hallelujah this man is 40 years old praise the Lord amen he's laying there daily at the temple and we're finding here amen as we go along now that this miracle like we are saying Jesus was saying amen the glory now where were they in front of the temple was the glory once in the temple so what we are presented with in Acts chapter 3 is the glory that was once in the temple was now in Jesus amen but it not move from Jesus into the disciples amen yes amen but watch what they do they don't take the glory for themselves they give the glory back to God so when we are saying the glory is being revealed in you it's to be amen the glory of shakan of Glory is revealing you to give God back the glory amen praise the Lord amen so no doubt this man would have been begging at the temple being 40 years old Jesus may have passed him by begging at the temple many times amen would have seen Jesus but Jesus did not heal him amen praise the lord we find here even as we read the chapter now it says Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour hallelujah amen what is the 9th hour amen it's 300 p.m. they're going into the temple but who's walking there amen it is faith and charity faith is walking with love so if your faith doesn't have love with it you are not going to be that super Church in a super race amen we are looking at the first miracle because this church must be a continuation of the book of Acts Hallelujah everybody understand that amen amen praise the Lord so they're going at the n9th hour of the day this is amen maybe many people are not religious but sometimes you need some religion you need to know how God operates and works amen this the these Jews were going up at the ninth hour of the day after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus after the baptism of the Holy Ghost they were going at the ninth hour of the day and here at the ninth hour of the day A man was going to receive a miracle he was going to be healed from paralysis from being crippled from it the time of his birth amen I want you to know it was at the n9th hour of the day that Elijah brought the evening sacrifice on Mount carel amen and the Lord descended upon that sacrifice with fire yes and it was at that time that the heart of the children of Israel was turned back to the faith of the fathers amen amen amen it was also the time that the Passover Lamb was slain and Jesus cried out on the cross you'll find this in Matthew 27:46 the Bible says about the 9th hour Jesus cried out why have you forsaken me so the sacrifice is on the cross at the 9th hour of the day and it was around the ninth hour of the day that Jesus died on the cross praise the Lord amen so 10: 3 and 4 you read there it was the 9th hour of the day that Cornelius starts to see a vision he sees the vision of an angel coming in and saying your prayers and your arms are come up before for a memorial before God what should he say your prayers and your arms I say we serve a god of Hebrews 138 who is the same yesterday today and forever and God still sees your prayers and your arms amen praise the Lord amen remember we are a church of faith and of Charity amen amen praise the Lord so we've got to be a church that is Manifest in the works of Christ as well that are amen a generous Church a giving Church a loving church and a faithful [Music] church amen it's so Cornelius you find sees a vision of the angel coming there and he says your praise and your arms are come for a memorial before God Amen and and in Acts 10: 30 and 31 it says 4 days ago was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold a man sat Before Me In Bright clothing and said Cornelius your prayer has been heard and your arms are remembered in the sight of God Amen I want to remind you of a quote I don't have it now but you'll know we've been through this many times brother Bram says when you have faith in the prayer line and even faith in a service he says maybe the next day the angel of God comes around the neighborhood seeing who is still in faith but what hour could it be I ask you yes amen amen because if you are thinking that we are so organized in our natural realm here I want you to know the Heavenly realm is more organized than us yes amen we derive all of our laws and strategies and everything based on a Heavenly pattern sometimes they don't even know it they call it the law of this the law of that the law of this but it is based God put that law there hallelujah amen amen so we are finding here that Peter and John are walking in amen faith and love are walking together and it is Faith working through love and it is love that produces the faith so this man is sitting at this gate called Beautiful amen but there is no Beauty in this man he is crle he's never walked a day in his life and he's begging there and when he saw Peter and John about to enter in he asked them for money the Bible says what are people asking you for maybe it's not only money they're asking you for maybe some are looking for some attention some are looking for love hey girls don't get me wrong now go give any uh you know Ru who comes to you and say he no he's looking for my attention and no I'm talking about a spiritual condition you Choose Wisely you choose a holy ghost filled Son of God Brothers you choose a holy ghost filled daughter of God Amen don't we say ah this poor girl she's like a jezebel but never mind the Bible says I must have love she's going to give you hell for your love amen praise the Lord now they come into the temple Court when he saw Peter I mean verse three there now amen Acts chapter 3 when he saw Peter and John about to enter he asked them for money Peter looked directly at him as did John so Peter and John Peter fasting his eyes upon Him W John said look on us yes amen now look on us doesn't mean that they must pay attention to the men what they are saying in the spiritual realm is look at us because this is how God is revealing himself at this time in season brother Bram says it another way the only Bible that people will read is you so if the only Bible they read is you where will the only love come from where will the only perfect Faith come from from the bride praise the Lord so look on us also showing that the veil had changed yes well look on us means have confidence in US yes when you go to pray for somebody if they don't have confidence in you nothing will happen to them now you know that generally when somebody is begging their eyes are down maybe because of humility or the feeling embarrassing so they this man is probably his head is down not looking at them and he's asking them for money and Peter tells him look on us amen Fix Your Eyes On Us Praise the Lord lucky they ped and say Lord take me out of the way that I won't be seen Lord you must know who Veil behind you you must know with what Authority you're walking within this hour amen you need to speak with authority too Hallelujah so Peter looks at him and he says look on Us Praise the Lord and he gave them heed so this man now faces his attention upon Peter and John remember it's faith and love Hallelujah and he gave e unto them expecting to receive something of them there's got to be an expectation amen even as I'm preaching to you this morning what's the expectation in your heart amen what do you want out of the service what is the desire of your heart amen praise the Lord amen what is the desire of your heart please don't be a person who has no expectation and no desire and no vision that's not a son and daughter of God Sons and Daughters of God are full of vision they are full of purpose amen they walking Purpose Driven lives praise the Lord if you go and read Genesis chap one there amen chapter 2 verse one chapter 1 verse 2 God is looking at a dark World a void world Amen a world in chaos but God doesn't speak what he sees yes God speaks what he wants in the back part of his mind am yes amen over your situation don't speak what you see oh I don't have money oh I'm so poor oh I don't have this oh I'm so depressed I'm so don't speak what you see if you're a son and daughter of God you speak like how Abraham learned to speak like God he called those things which are not as though they are amen so speak amen what you want over your situation if you are in lack speak what you want let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich let the blind say I can see amen and if you understand the law of God how it works when he's saying write the vision make it known upon tablets and you got to wait for it how if you know you can't s Idol you can't write here write the vision the Bible says write the vision how many if you know abook write the vision so you got a vision Lord I I my vision is this this this I'm writing it down you take that thing you fold it there put it under your pillow then you jump on the pillow and you sleep no who is God going to use to bring that to pass God is going to use you now so you can't be lazy a lazy man will grow die die poor because God can can't bless nothing but God can bless the fruits of your hands praise the Lord amen when God created Adam and this man was created in the image of God he had dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowls of the air over mountains the r he could speak to animal life God makes a garden and tell him walk in the garden so if you got your gri on time to kick the gri off time to get to work God put you on the earth to work and God will bless the fruits of your hands yes amen hallelujah we can't be lazy people there shouldn't be any lazy people in the kingdom of God amen amen we ought to drive out all laziness we ought to drive out amen anything that doesn't have a vision or a purpose hallelujah amen turn to your brother and sister tell them don't be lazy don't worry they won't get angry with you because you're repeating what I'm saying so tell them if you don't want to say that to them directly tell them the pastor say don't be lazy praise the Lord amen hallelujah so the man gives his attention to Faith and love I am telling you that something something somebody's expectation will be met here today yes now watch we had a testimony come back sister Victory sister Maggie finally gave the testimony of a clear test result of brother Duncan amen now let me tell you something that brother had AR attack sister Victor you had AR attack you had Art Attack From what the doctor said sister Ruth you had AR attack none of them have been for a stent an operation or anything because of [Applause] prayer remember when brother Duncan's testimony when brother Duncan's prayer request came through remember we having the all night prayer meeting and remember what I told you church I said he's not even a believer you don't go to church but I said because he did good to the bride he put on this Aon unit here I said we are praying on that basis because he did good to the bride thank you Lord so you read the message on the group he doesn't even need a stent no will he need a bypass and all his test results came back clear what is that the power of God working through faith and charity so this word is real yes that those who do good to the bride yeah yes who sends you forgiven they are forgiven amen that's scripture now if you don't want to believe scripture something's wrong with you who sins you remit they are remit amen and whose sin you retain they are retained I say unto you said Jesus amen that whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven how powerful are your words and whatsoever you loose or not shall be loosed in heaven amen amen so here is the same example now Peter and John is saying look on us now remember faith is not selfish no is love selfish Peter's not timeing to take the glory here because he understands where his faith is coming from amen it's coming from love who's accompanying him he says look on Us Praise the Lord look on both faith and charity amen don't look to faith alone you also need love accompanied with it maybe your situation has not responded to your faith I ask you to revisit your situation and bring the Divine Sovereign Love of Jesus upon it Hallelujah faith and love are looking look at this man but he was not looking at them so they need him to fix the eyes on this [Music] truth and I'm saying it again don't come here and tell me you got uh you got in this hour of the spoken word don't come tell me you got silent prayer request yes in fact the the word is unspoken we in the age of spoken word yeah you saying you're unspoken something is wrong you must speak the word amen Lord I don't want anyone else to know Lord and something's wrong with you because the Bible says confess your faults one to another in fact your lives ought to be open books before one another ah Lord nobody else must know this Lord please you come put one not here please ask the church to pray for me I got unspoken request now they don't know what to pray for these men are moving full of Faith open and charity here they don't know what to pray for Lord whatever they are saying Lord go and meet them at the point of need even God don't know what you because you spoken ask yes whatsoever Mark 11:23 whatsoever things you say did it say pray to the mountain or say to the mountain say to the mountain praise the Lord you know they came to brother Bram and they spoke request oh the water in my tap is salty this is wrong even the you know so many things they came and spoke to the prophet and because they spoke the request God answered their faith amen so don't come here with silent prayer request Lord if you're truly God read my mind Hey no in the age of the spoken word spoken word is the Original Seed praise the Lord the Bible says call your brother you need to have somebody you can connect with tell them brother I'm going through this year you know I'm believing God I'm trusting God you know there's another quote you can probably find it uh if you read it carefully the prophet is saying that that a brother will come to you and say my crops are burning up there's been no rain and he say you'll say to him I'll send you rain how many if you read the quote he says there's a manifestation Romans 8 man praise the Lord there's a manifestation so you need to have confidence what I'm telling you here now you need to have confidence in your brother that they are carrying Faith open charity hallelujah amen a word spoken from the pulpit you receive it by faith you watch the manifestation follow it it could take one month two month 3 months 4 month five month watch the manifestation that will follow it amen praise the Lord amen let's move quickly now amen so he Peter looking directly at him said look on us so the man amen fasten his eyes now it says here and he gave e unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk amen hallelujah Faith becomes a spokesperson yes Faith becomes a spokesperson because it is your faith that is seen and without faith it's impossible to please God hallelujah amen even now speak over your situation even now speak over your circumstance amen hallelujah what is he saying me as a man I don't have the physical capacity to meet you at the point of need but such as I have which is the Holy Ghost amen we the main thing that we have is the Holy Ghost and we don't go to it as our source we are relying on our human strength such as I have have Acts chapter 2 will show you what Came Upon them and what they had they had the Holy Ghost so what he's doing so amen love is producing grace and grace is producing the substance called Faith to meet the [Music] Hope amen praise the Lord maybe we'll just read one quote just now to show you what the prophet is saying there how it breaths amen when you have perfect love how it it it creates now Faith praise the Lord so the man now Watch What Happens here let's read quickly as we go I'm trying to read the Bible too because I know a lot of you don't read the Bible so we're getting your Bible reading time here amen and that's not now to go say the Pastor said uh you'll read the Bible for me every week no it's to make you feel ashamed amen praise the Lord let's read such as I have give I Thee in the name name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk I hope you're learning how to deal with your situation there's a name above every other name there's a name at which demons tremble the whole family in heaven is named after the name of Jesus and this this becomes a contention even now when they have a trial for Peter and John they want to know by what name did you speak because we know the name of a man can't make somebody walk praise the Lord amen and he took him by the right hand praise the Lord sometimes people need a little help he told him rise up and walk but maybe people won't move with you preaching to them maybe people won't move with you testifying to them they need a little push they need a little help amen because the man probably didn't move but Peter took him by the right hand amen amen did you hear what I said I said rise up and walk amen rise up and walk watch what the Bible said now amen he took him by the right hand lifted him up and immediately his feet and his ankle bones receive strength amen amen showing you that those things were dead you know when you don't use your muscles what happens amen you know even when you're laying on bed for a long time in hospital they've got to send you for therapy amen they got to make you start to walk again I want you to know this guy never walked for 40 years and I want you to know even a baby must start to crawl before can walk so it takes time but God can bypass procedures God can bypass circumstances amen this man went from never walking to walking and not only walking he was leaping and jumping and praising God Amen yes Lord amen I tell you even some of you amongst you that never said an amen you can bypass protocols amen you can even skip saying an amen right now and start to jumping and praising God for his authority in you yes Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen amen thank you Jesus maybe you're you're the back of a TR for your for even for your whatever you're Desiring maybe it's a promotion whatever you're doing God can bypass Protocols are you reading that in the Bible God bypass protocols maybe you're waiting for a contract maybe you're waiting for business whatever it is amen I tell you God will make you shine like the brightness of his glory and God will select you because you have Divine favor in this time and season you've got to believe who you are as a son and daughter of God if these two men Peter and John faith and charity had no confidence the Holy Ghost didn't give them confidence you think they could have gone up to this man and said look on us I'm saying the Holy Ghost in us which is producing faith hope and charity ought to give the bride a confidence and a boldness to speak stop being shy and saying oh come on faith is bold faith is [Music] ragged amen we need a church to be on the Move now amen we need a Church of the Living God can you imagine a shy Soldier don't see Let Me Hide I want to go behind the scenes you can't be in camouflage here in the army of God praise the Lord amen hallelujah can you imagine Joshua Joshua when need Under The Chariot there I don't want anyone to see I'm speaking so you know humble you think when you meet the angel of God you know the anointing you are carrying amen you are bold in every circumstance amen you don't care who is listening to you you don't care if it's at work at school at home wherever it is you speak to your situation by faith amen I want you to know that without a without a Shadow of Doubt the angel of God is here with the church the angel of God never left the church the angel of God is here with the bride of Jesus Christ amen we've got to know that we are commissioned at this time amen thank you The Voice told John and John told took the book from the Angel and the angel said thou must prophesy again so the final voice is in your mouth amen the final Authority you carry oh yes amen but we can't be a silent group of people we've got to Proclaim boldness amen we've got to know we are the Church of the Living God Amen how many if you know Peter was faith we just said that right but if you go read the book of Peter faith is telling you please add to Faith amen add some charity add some virtue add some knowledge J some Temperance so when you are seeing faith and the Capstone charity you are seeing all of these virtues in you you're not just reading about Peter and John alone yeah you are seeing the complete Church the complete statue of a pyramid statue of a perfect man in action yeah yes yes amen we probably won't have time but maybe I should take the time because last week I gave you early leave last week you were saying so hot so I cut the server short amen praise the Lord amen I was telling brother Caleb hey I think I'm developing a bad appetite for the people because now I preach 1 hour and you go another service they preach 2 hours you can't handle it amen so we got to create some appetite amen praise the Lord amen but I won't do that to you I'm just trying to make you pay attention because as soon as you say you're closing everyone is like yo past closing now amen praise the Lord so this man was leaping he leaping up stood walked and entered with them into the temple so when God heals you it's not for your own glory for you to run away are you reading you the Bible says he walked with them and he went into the temple to worship so don't come tell us to pray for one unbeliever will never come to church that's right if they are getting healed they must come to church amen are you reading what the Bible is saying entered with them tell them hey we prayed for you tell them we prayed for you that's why you got healed now you must come with us back to the temple and you must give praise to God amen Amen brother brand says you better watch your motive tell God why you want to be healed and he says tell God that you start to make promises to him Lord I promise you if you heal me Lord I will serve you I will never go back to those things of the world again how many of you have read them tell God what why make a promise to him and then fulfill the promise he goes back into the temple Hallelujah but now watch is the glory in the temple or is the glory now veil in these men that he's walking with so he's walking in the glory amen amen this man is walking in the glory praise the Lord you can read I'm if you promise to read Acts chapter 4 you go home and you'll read about Peter and John now taken to trial brother Jeffer probably like that because he's a lawyer praise the Lord and you'll go and see how they declare the name of Jesus how Peter and John amen they say they were unschooled ordinary men amen but they healed with the name of Jesus back to the power of the Holy Ghost amen and they command them to stop preaching but they say no should we listen to the voice of God or the voice of men Hallelujah here in verse 21 of Acts CH 4 it says after further threats they let them go they could not find a way to punish them because all the people were glorifying God for what happened you see what's the purpose of God doing the miraculous in the church so that people can start to glorify his name people can start to worship him and give him glory and give him praise amen why are we walking in this anointing why is the bride equipped with this anointing if you read in the Book of Luke when Peter James and John are taken up into man Transfiguration there and the glory Cloud descends how many of you have read that The Cloud of Glory descends amen we read this chapter last week I'm closing now with this I got 3 minutes amen you don't want to close she's saying don't close can you she's saying I don't want to close praise the lord we got the chapter brother last week's sermon let me give you Luke Chapter what was it when Peter James and John are taken up but I'll just say it now because I'm closing Peter James and John are taken up on Mount Transfiguration and the Bible says there when Peter James and John were taken up and The Cloud of Glory descended the Bible says they entered into the cloud amen how many of you have read that amen they entered into the cloud now I want you to know the cloud didn't just Veil Jesus like a garment so only here was the cloud like here right so because it's a Cloud of Glory 27 Mi high and 30 Mi wide what is this Cloud seven angels so it's a cloud that envelopes him yes right everybody paying attention amen so the Bible says they entered into the cloud amen you put up Revelation 101 there I'm driving a PO you Revelation 10:1 says what that the angel came down from heaven clothed with what so the cloud is covering the Earth and the bride enters the cloud thank you amen if Peter James and John had to enter the cloud at the adoption ceremony the bride in this hour must believe the cloud yes must enter the cloud amen for the adoption ceremony amen so what you are seeing here is the the glory of God they clothed with a cloud the angel is clothed with a cloud meaning it surrounds him it surrounds him and when the bride goes what I'm saying is the cloud didn't leave him when John goes to take the book amen everybody understanding this picture yeah the angel is clothed with a cloud he's surrounded with a cloud right John 10:10 I think it is 1010 sorry Revelation 10:10 just the next uh so when he's taking the book from the Angel's hand did he enter the cloud come on now if if he's clothed with this cloud when John is going to take the book if he comes within close distance of the angel will he enter into the cloud praise the Lord let's stand amen I want to show you what anointing we are operating under the bride has entered into the cloud thank you into the realm of seven angels that is why because night after night an angel came to the prophet to give that message so there Bride is a powerful Army but we've got got to know the keys how to operate so I say again if you've been operating love without faith you need love and faith if you've been operating faith without love you need love now there are different types of love there's filio love there's agape love and there's OS love the love we are talking about is the agape love it's a love that transcends the human love amen praise the Lord Lord glory be to his name as I close now I want you to know you can't keep faith in prison amen you can't keep faith in prison praise the Lord when they imprisoned Peter what happened even the angel descended to release Faith from prison amen did the angel descend to release Peter you remember Peter walked up to the disciples and he knocked on the door the girl opens the door and she thought she's seeing a ghost why you can't arrest faith God won't allow your faith to be arrested amen amen amen God will even descend from heaven with an angel and release Faith amen so if Satan has crippled your faith arrested your faith this this morning we are releasing your faith the angel of God is here to unlock you every chain to unlock you from every prison and you know what else talking about faith and love you can't kill love they couldn't kill John no matter how much they tried to kill him they put him in a pot of oil and they tried to burn him this man was Unstoppable he was unshakable he was immovable love they couldn't kill John amen why John is the one who go in the Rapture yes so you can't kill John because she must she must go in the Rapture that's why in type John couldn't be killed John must take the book he's right there at the end of the Gentile dispensation because Revelation 11 starts with Moses and Elijah coming to the Jews yes so at the end there now of Revelation 10 you must know it's the end of the Gentile dispensation the final prophecy is on the earth and John is there type of love and if you know I'm closing with this statement if love is there what must it produce so what's needed in this hour for the Rapture yes but what's needed for the Rapture perfect Faith so can you see how we are positioned John is there he's typing love but where is love how is love how is Faith going to be produced love will produce Faith love will produce the faith faith for the Rapture amen agape love that comes upon us yes amen so the faith that we had at the foundation now becomes super Faith because a Capstone has come upon us amen then now he says watch what happens then amen when this bride comes into her position Satan becomes powerless before her she's said super Church super raise Invincible Army I tell you nothing can shake you amen if you only know who you are if you only have the realization of who you are no circumstance you can speak over every circumstance I say there's no circumstance in your life that is gone far beyond reach or out of control you can stand here as a son and daughter of God right now I'm challenging you to speak over your situation right now whatever you're going through in your life speak over your situation maybe you spoke something else over your situation right now I want you to speak what you want the positive outcome of it amen change your situation with your words yes if you say if you speak it lies within you amen and what the ministry is doing here this morning it's taking the lame man by the hand and pulling him up look on us amen I say to you even this morning look on us if you don't have any strength in yourself look on us amen his anointing is veiled here Peter and John were God's Representatives this combination must be in every believer if you want to see yourself walk into high dimensions of the Holy Ghost if you want to say see yourself operate as a statue of a perfect man this is the [Music] key and I'm expecting a Greater Harvest of the Supernatural and the miraculous when Sons and Daughters of God start to walk like this Brothers I'm challenging every one of you what you have seen what you have seen so far with Miracles and the power of God in the church has just been the foundational work we are moving now to where they'll shut the heavens they'll speak you come you tell me brother I have need of rain I'll send you rain somebody's got to stand up and start to speak like that [Music] amen oh brother there's been no rain I have need of this I don't have need of this you know when somebody ask you that what they telling you help me sometimes you tell the brother okay I'll pray about it don't don't say that did Peter and John say look on God because they understood the mystery of where God was veiled now we can't be preaching Christ The Mystery of God revealed knowing that he's manifesting himself through the bride and we speak with ignorance yes start to have confidence in who we are amen know who we are we have entered the cloud The Cloud of [Music] Glory the angel of God is here let's sing amen new things are being declared I'm declaring new things to you now this morning [Music] amen [Music] amen if you thought you hit the ceiling in in the miraculous and the supernatural that will now become your foundation until this day no man could tell us just where we came from and where we go from here oh but Through The Eyes Of The Prophet
