And believers of like precious faith can come together.

I want to appreciate and thank the pastor in absencia for allowing me to stand behind this sacred desk. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever I will say will be of benefit to someone. &gt;&gt; But you say, "Hey, this is foreign." I would then advise you to just take it in the dusty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh brother Brandham taught us that your pastor is out there to see you through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; So it's wonderful and good to stand and stay with your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So uh whatever he says and whatever he teaches you will be the best for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh because uh I'm here I I pray also that the Lord will speak to our heart this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God bless you so much. I will not talk much about the people that I've have accompanied me here. The the brother is already pronounced that. So we go straight into the word. Uh I I don't bring nothing new. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have no private revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because all things will &gt;&gt; through the prophet. &gt;&gt; All we need to do is to recite those. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh we only pray that uh maybe to God that he gives us the right thing to recite on a particular day. So we are thankful this morning. God bless you so much. &gt;&gt; Um turn with me &gt;&gt; to the book of James chapter number five. Before we read, can we bow our heads and pray? Dear God, our gracious heavenly father, we are thankful this morning, eternal Jehovah, that we are here for one purpose, one objective, and one intention to fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're praying, dear God, as you promised in your word that where two or three are gathered in my name, there I shall be in their midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May you fulfill your word this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. Precious Lord, as we read your word, may you come and inspire the reading and inspire the preaching. Dear God, that at the end of the service, we will gladly say it was good to be in the present. Help me dear precious Lord as I stand before your holy purchase this morning. I'm praying for your divine guidance and praying for your inspiration. Father God, that whatever I will say this morning will be of benefit to someone here. &gt;&gt; We pray and commit this service into your hands. Have your own way in Jesus precious and wonderful name I pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. um the book of uh uh James chapter 11, a very very familiar scriptures that we want to read and we trust the Lord is going to help us and get something out of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Like the brother said, uh the bride is from everywhere. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's from every nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh from every tribe and uh so we happy that uh we are here uh to fellowship with our people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; James chapter number five and uh we're reading very familiar scriptures here. &gt;&gt; Let's pick it from verse number 16. familiar scriptures. Uh, confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed. The effect of even prayer of a righteous man athlet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if this is the way things should happen and this is the way to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Confess your faults one to another. Yes. &gt;&gt; After that is done, what do you do next? &gt;&gt; Pray one for another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That he may be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe uh healing is in in two parts. You can be healed physically, &gt;&gt; but the most important healing is spiritual. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says the effect of f prayer of a righteous man. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. So it's not every prayer that works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That has to be known. It's not every prayer that works. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in a fix your fe of a righteous man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; It's the one that will avail much. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means any of prayer will have result. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can see this is the result of the prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we pray, &gt;&gt; we think God does not hear, &gt;&gt; but God hears. Not only that, but God answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So sometimes we get to forget that we worship a God who has ears, &gt;&gt; a God that is eyes. &gt;&gt; So when you pray, &gt;&gt; God hears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he hears, he answers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So many times we doubt our own selves and we also doubt our own prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You doubt your own self &gt;&gt; and you doubt your own prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Satan will want people like that. People that they that doubt their own selves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, &gt;&gt; let me tell you this, brother. Message believers are equipped enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the equipment is not far away from you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; All that you need is with you. &gt;&gt; But Satan would want you to believe that you are inferior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to tell you that &gt;&gt; your prayer can never be answered. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you feel that God does not hear your prayer. M &gt;&gt; I'm here this morning &gt;&gt; to try and uplift you by the grace of God &gt;&gt; that you must believe in your God &gt;&gt; and believe in yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother says the greatest miracle that has happened under the sun is when a a sinner become a sinner. &gt;&gt; Any other miracles we want them but they come under that one. The greatest. &gt;&gt; So already you must realize that you're a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If such a thing would happen to you, &gt;&gt; what about healing? &gt;&gt; It becomes minor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz God did the major thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Upon you, that's the reason you are here. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; In this neighborhood, there are so many people, but so many people are not here. And you are here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; you must believe &gt;&gt; that something happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God had a reason. &gt;&gt; God had a purpose. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For you. That's why you are here. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like he say, he says to David, remember where I picked you. &gt;&gt; I picked you from the sheep God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray for a reason and for a purpose. Let's read on verse number 17. He says Elas was a man &gt;&gt; subject to like passions as we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Elijah was as human as you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not a superhuman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He of course Elijah was a prophet but he was a human. The Bible says subject to light passions as we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he prayed &gt;&gt; earnestly. &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. Elijah prayed earnestly &gt;&gt; that it might not rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it rained not on the earth but in the space of 3 years and 6 months. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see the result of Elijah's prayer. He prayed earnestly and he asked God but he would not rain for three and a half years and God heard that prayer and God answered the prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for three and a half years there was no rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; People did not know what was happening but it was because of the it was the result of Elijah's prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Verse number 18. And he prayed again &gt;&gt; and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth the fruit. &gt;&gt; So prayer can change things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Elijah, a man, am I preaching to humans to this morning? &gt;&gt; So you can pray a prayer and when God answers the prayer, you will know this is the answer. &gt;&gt; God has answered my prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Elijah prayed because of the condition and the state of Israel. He prayed that for three and a half years &gt;&gt; they would have a drop from heaven. &gt;&gt; No matter their projections and what their signs would say &gt;&gt; I would want to believe the methodological people had projected something about that year. But when Elijah prayed, &gt;&gt; it changed everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And people were wondering what is happening? Is this Elino? Is this what what is this whatever? Elijah knew I have prayed &gt;&gt; that God is not going to bring rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For three and a half years. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So when it was happening, &gt;&gt; Elijah was says this is the answer to my prayer. &gt;&gt; When the 3 and 1/2 years were up, he comes back to the same God and say, "Lord, this time I'm praying for rain." &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he prayed, God answered that prayer and there came &gt;&gt; So God answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to title my message power behind a believer's prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Power behind &gt;&gt; a believer's prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Enjoy the comfort of your seat. Uh turn with me again to the book of Mark and chapter number 11 verse number 23. Mark 11:23. Another familiar scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, &gt;&gt; I I like the way the Bible expresses it, &gt;&gt; whosoever. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whosoever. &gt;&gt; You can put your name there. &gt;&gt; Whosoever. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not for particular people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's whosoever. That's right. &gt;&gt; Say to this mountain, be thou removed and be cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; 34 Therefore I say unto you, what thingsoever ye desire &gt;&gt; when ye pray, &gt;&gt; believe &gt;&gt; that he receive them and he shall have them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So sometimes we we we don't possess certain things. Not because God does not want us to have them, but it's because we are not following the provided way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a desire, I believe every human being, as long as you are alive, you will have desires. &gt;&gt; If you are desireless, you are dead. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But here is the solution to your desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord says, "Therefore I say unto you, &gt;&gt; what thingsoever ye desire," &gt;&gt; so if you have a desire, a right desire, that's fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just wait there and keep on desiring and keep on desiring and keep on desiring. Move to the next step. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have got a desire, that's wonderful. But your next step is after the desire, what must you do? You must pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you pray, you must believe. &gt;&gt; And when you believe, then you must receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I normally say to brothers, there is an equation, not a mathematical equation, no. But any question in the faith &gt;&gt; that desire plus prayer plus believing is equals to receiving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is how the equation is completed. &gt;&gt; Desire. If you say desire and desire and desire and desire, it might not do you any good. &gt;&gt; Move to the next. We want the equation completed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to solve the equation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you ask children that go to school &gt;&gt; in mathematics, they say solve this equation. &gt;&gt; You must follow the proper steps to solve the equation. So desire plus &gt;&gt; prayer &gt;&gt; plus. &gt;&gt; Believing equals receiving. &gt;&gt; Then the equation is complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. These things we we have them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Lord has already given us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A believer is someone who is equipped. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And equipped to the full. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So sometimes Satan will tell you you some down something. &gt;&gt; You're some useless. Not in this faith. &gt;&gt; There are no useless people. If you are living right, doing right, and you believe the word, you are you are useful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's look at this. The power behind a believer's prayer. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to believers this morning. &gt;&gt; I want to show you that there's a power behind your prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You in your individual capacity right as you are there. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking of what is in your pocket. &gt;&gt; That's not the issue. &gt;&gt; I want to talk about what is in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It has to be coming from somewhere when you pray from the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then something must happen. &gt;&gt; Remember brother Brham says &gt;&gt; we can sin too much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you you say, "Hey, the song service was too long. That's too much." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "You can laugh too much. &gt;&gt; You can do any other thing too much. &gt;&gt; But there is one thing that you can never overdone, which is prayer." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may laugh too much. &gt;&gt; You may shout too much. &gt;&gt; You may eat too much. &gt;&gt; But you never pray too much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Christ sent his disciples &gt;&gt; to go two by two. He never taught them what how to preach. &gt;&gt; He never taught them how to testify. He say just go. Huh? &gt;&gt; So to preach, he never taught them. to testify. He never told them. But one time in Luke chapter number 11 when Christ the disciples were trying to look at Christ the way he lived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So at one time after he had finished praying, they came back and said, "Lord, teach us how to pray." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you cannot just pray, you need to be taught. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can't be taught by anyone. It is only God who will teach you how to pray. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they say, "God, teach us how to pray." We heard that John would teach his disciples how to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In one message, Brother Brandham says, I think we must read this one. &gt;&gt; He says, um, prayer is an atomic bomb. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Huh. &gt;&gt; In the message expectation &gt;&gt; uh preaching on the 7th of February 1961 is 610207 and paragraph number 25. I think that we must read. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together there? &gt;&gt; What man calls great, &gt;&gt; God calls foolish. &gt;&gt; Always remember this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we mustn't go by the type. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. What man calls great &gt;&gt; then God calls that foolish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what man calls foolish, God calls great. You see the world and the word are always par. So if by the world you must that tight is foolishness to God. &gt;&gt; Remember that. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you go the tide of the world is foolishness. &gt;&gt; But the world says if you go the tide of the word, the world says that's foolishness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah. So what we got to do is get back into the problem program problem program of God and find out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't you want that? &gt;&gt; So God has a program and you and I must go back to that program. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says in order for us to go back into God's program because God has a problem as we speak and we we want to find out what that problem is. After all, he says what? And uh um so what we've got to do is get back into the program of God &gt;&gt; and find out after all what God wants us to do. &gt;&gt; So God wants you to do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How then do you know what God wants you to do? &gt;&gt; You must find out there's a program for you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Designed by God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only way, that's what brother says, the only way I know to do it is prayer. &gt;&gt; So prayer is a provision for you to get into God's truth. &gt;&gt; For you to know what God wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I tell you, Satan will fight prayer like you never want. &gt;&gt; I would not be surprised that someone has come to church this morning and never pray. &gt;&gt; It's not that you are very evil. &gt;&gt; But Satan fights that thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He understands what prayer means &gt;&gt; and he understands what prayer can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brother? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. for you to get into God's program. Prayer is the key. That's the answer. Prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget these things. &gt;&gt; Brother says prayer is the key. &gt;&gt; The key. &gt;&gt; What does the key do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It gives you access. &gt;&gt; Huh? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It might sound like it's very a very small component, but if you don't have the key to that door, we can't access here. &gt;&gt; And when you are outside and it's raining, what happens &gt;&gt; when it's hot? What happens &gt;&gt; when it's cool? What happens? It's because you are failing to get the access. &gt;&gt; So prayer is the key. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer gets you in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, watch this one now. Prayer is the most powerful weapon &gt;&gt; that was ever put in control of the human beings. &gt;&gt; No. Prayer is the most powerful weapon. If you ask anyone who is not a message believer and ask him which is the most powerful human, they will tell you about the atomic power. &gt;&gt; But we know better than that. &gt;&gt; Prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in in the control of human beings. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer. &gt;&gt; Prayer would change the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are fully and dangerously equipped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are not cheap. &gt;&gt; Let me help someone this morning. You are not cheap. &gt;&gt; You are fully equipped &gt;&gt; and dangerously equipped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the only thing that can change God's mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because we read in the Bible that God sent his prophet by the name of Isaiah to King Hezekiah. &gt;&gt; And he says Hezekiah was sick. &gt;&gt; And when Isaiah came, he came with just says the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. M &gt;&gt; I believe when Hezekiah saw Isaiah coming in, he says he brings good tidings. &gt;&gt; God has remembered me. Isaiah came, he says, "Oh king, your majesty, I've got news for you." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Say all." He says, "Thus says the Lord, &gt;&gt; put your house in order. &gt;&gt; You're going to die." And when he said that Isaiah left with such tidings but Hezekiah here the king &gt;&gt; instead of him crying &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says it's okay man of God. &gt;&gt; I know where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He faced the wall and he began to pray. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you read in the Bible the type of prayer he met, he says, "Lord, you know me." I like that. It was a face to face. It was Hezekiah and his God. &gt;&gt; They knew one another. A believer must know his God and God must know him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many people pretend or assume that they know God, but God does not know them. &gt;&gt; That's the unfortunate part. But a believer is in connection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You and your God. &gt;&gt; So Hezekiah looked to the wall and he began to pray. And God answered that prayer. He had the prayer. &gt;&gt; Before Isaiah left the court, &gt;&gt; the king's palace. God came down to Isaiah with another says the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things. If you want things change brother &gt;&gt; pray &gt;&gt; don't m and cry and also no pray &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; what comes down to Isaiah says go back to his but I've pronounced I've told him says no no no there's a different trajectory now go back to him and tell him that I've heard your &gt;&gt; prayer immediately &gt;&gt; I've given you the 15 years that you've requested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer changes &gt;&gt; things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you sometimes don't forget family prayer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's integral part of our being. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's not every prayer. The fixual fever prayer of &gt;&gt; a righteous man. &gt;&gt; It availth much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I drop something here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something very interesting, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer of a righteous man of faith much. Huh? But uh &gt;&gt; Satan hates the brain believer. Yes. &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He hates &gt;&gt; a praying believer. &gt;&gt; Was in the message. Believe in God. &gt;&gt; 52 0224. Believe in God. Paragraph 150. Something very interesting. Listen to what the prophet says here. And I know this that some of us has more faith than others &gt;&gt; which is fine. We can't be at the same level. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some have got more faith than others. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. And those who have abundance of faith are supposed to pray for those. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You see that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that have abundance of faith, what must they do? &gt;&gt; They must pray for those that is lesser faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But here is something very important. But the prophet then says, "But if you don't live right," &gt;&gt; uh if you don't live the right kind of life, &gt;&gt; you better live away from it from what? From prayer, &gt;&gt; do you hear that? &gt;&gt; The devil will laugh at your prayer. Yeah. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; If you don't live the right kind of life &gt;&gt; and then you will try and pray, you wasting time. &gt;&gt; One person who is very happy is the devil. &gt;&gt; When you are praying, he loves you. &gt;&gt; Or maybe he cheers you up. Then pray on, pray on, pray on. Satan himself But when you live right and do right and act right and have faith in God, Satan, not demons, &gt;&gt; Satan himself will tremble when you speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see why Satan tries to hinder you from praying? &gt;&gt; If Satan trembles, what happened to the demons? &gt;&gt; They already fallen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Satan will tremble at your prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Because God swore under obligation he would take care of that prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he never prayed in vain. Many people would want to believe that ah I think God did not answer hear my prayer. Let me tell you this morning God he had every prayer. &gt;&gt; Yes. And God will answer every prayer &gt;&gt; because what what you remember what happened to Daniel when Daniel prayed in a very foreign land was in Babylon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But still the Babylonian situation would not hit Daniel's breath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Daniel prayed in. So you can pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh in this other side of the remember um it is for a believer it is the most glorious time &gt;&gt; but I tell you from creation the the earth has never been in this state where it is now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it has rotten to the core. &gt;&gt; It becomes in inhabitable. &gt;&gt; Yes. You remember the scripture says the spirit and the bride &gt;&gt; they say come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's so burdensome. &gt;&gt; People are drinking sin like water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we you think it's happening just in South Africa, it's happening everywhere. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you still want and you living comfortably in this earth, something is wrong somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we look around, we say it's it's homegoing time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in this Babylon, &gt;&gt; in that condition, God still answers prayer. &gt;&gt; You can pray to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and God will answer the prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things are so bad. &gt;&gt; No, you know, you see um the Bible refers. It says, "But as it was in the days of &gt;&gt; No. Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As it was in the days of &gt;&gt; Lord, how many?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; People had forgotten the days of Lord. People had forgotten who they are. The spirit of Sodom was so bad. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Remember Lord's daughters. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; The the the boys there for whatever reason maybe they wanted these certificate for certain benefit. &gt;&gt; They come and the bowler to Lot and say no forget about the &gt;&gt; and they were sodomite. That spirit has reached the peak now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God destroyed and Gomorra that &gt;&gt; this earth cannot be spread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you must if that be so God must go back and resurrect the people of sorrow &gt;&gt; and apologize. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly where we are at. Yes. &gt;&gt; To such an extent that uh uh uh believers if ever there was a time when believers desired to be connected to God, it is now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I I I I think everywhere else you see Preachers are encouraging people that you must receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost is your ticket. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no way you can get to the rapture without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was preaching one time back home. I said I hear people say in 2027 I'll go to Canada but we're in 2025. Huh? He talks of going to Canada in 2027. Huh? &gt;&gt; He knows the the airplane number. Not only that, he also knows his seat number &gt;&gt; in an airplane that you fly in in 2027 while it's in 2025. &gt;&gt; You know the airplane, you know the seat number, you know the departure time &gt;&gt; and the landing time. Huh? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Bernham says rapture will be between &gt;&gt; 6 and 9. &gt;&gt; So we know the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you you you you you can sit down and relax and tell people that I will go to Canada. If people don't understand how things work, &gt;&gt; they will see you as someone who's crazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. to say I'll be sitting on seat number 5B &gt;&gt; in 2027 in Fly Emirates. &gt;&gt; Huh? Precisely. But some great morning &gt;&gt; when this life is over, I will fly away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I must also have the ticket. Hh. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to rush and say on the day he said go to to to pay and say I'm coming to check in. He say fine give us your details. &gt;&gt; Sorry sir. Can I find you? So you have got no seat in flying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So right now we are in preparation. Amen. &gt;&gt; I always tell the brothers that there's some enthusiasm we have &gt;&gt; when we go for conventions. I don't know what happens here in South Africa but in our country when people go for conventions there is a lot of enthusiasm. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of preparation going for the convention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But remember we are also going for one &gt;&gt; an eternal youth convention. &gt;&gt; Amen. Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must be enthused. &gt;&gt; There must be a curiosity &gt;&gt; preparing for the convention. &gt;&gt; So you say there are things needed &gt;&gt; in the convention. &gt;&gt; There are things that you don't need. So what do we do? We pack and unpack. &gt;&gt; Leave all the things that are not needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And pack all the things that are needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your suitcase must be ready for the coming convention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you prepare, you be sure that you have your ticket. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So you must have your ticket &gt;&gt; to go to that convention, eternal youth convention. This is why we are this is what we are doing to prepare for that. &gt;&gt; But the ticket is the Holy Ghost. Huh? &gt;&gt; Does this take fasting to have the Holy Ghost? You can fast and fast and fast and fast and never get &gt;&gt; Why? The Holy Ghost is a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all? &gt;&gt; So for you to have the gift, you must please the giver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see parents here. How do you feel when a child comes from school with a report and that report is showing that he's excellently doing the right thing? The moment you see that report before you talk to the child, the father and the mother, they lock themselves in the bedroom and they ask one another, "What must we do for this one?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh-huh. Hey, you have praised the parents. &gt;&gt; They will do all they can &gt;&gt; to get you a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In appreciation of what you did. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that they encourage you. So the Holy Ghost is a &gt;&gt; gift. Where is it coming from? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From God. So if you want the Holy Ghost, what you do? Please the giver. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you do right, act right. Live right up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; It's good to fast, but you can fast for the Holy Ghost the whole of your life and never receive it. &gt;&gt; Please the giver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is attracted by a life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some say, "Keep me true, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Keep me true." &gt;&gt; There's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. &gt;&gt; Give me power every hour to be true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So Daniel when he prayed, even though he was in Babylon, God heard the prayer and God answered the prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said maybe God did not answer it was answered right there. But when was coming with the answer, the chief the the prince of Persia with stood him for 3 weeks. But the the the prayer was already &gt;&gt; answered. &gt;&gt; So let me assure you brother, your prayer was answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God heard it the moment you pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God answered it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So relax. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't allow Satan to tell you that God did not hear. He had &gt;&gt; he did not just hear, he had and he &gt;&gt; according God is not a man. &gt;&gt; He answers the way he wants it. But the answer is your prayer was answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me brother, sister? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I add more? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes people when God answers they overwhelmed they even doubt their prayer. Huh? You have prayed. When God answers even doubt say ah no it can't be &gt;&gt; Acts chapter number 12 let me show you something Acts 12 verse number one these are simple scriptures that we know you see something was happening Herod was doing Now about that time, Herod the king stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church. &gt;&gt; So you must know Herod can also stretch his hand to vex you. &gt;&gt; But you must know what to do. &gt;&gt; And and he killed James the brother of joy &gt;&gt; with the sword. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Who was James? The disciple. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; One of the 24 elders. &gt;&gt; When the devil straight his hand, he got a hold. He was the son of &gt;&gt; Ze. James was killed. Believers went for a funeral of a brother that was killed. And when that happened, when that happened, huh, verse number three says, "And because he saw it, please the Jews, huh, &gt;&gt; the unbelieving Jews, &gt;&gt; they rejoice over James. Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; He proceeded further to take Peter also. Then there were the days of unleven bread. And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison and delivered him to the four continions of soldiers to keep him intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people so that Peter will be killed too. &gt;&gt; Amen. The believers were coming right from a funeral of a brother &gt;&gt; who was killed by Herod. And they said we step up higher. They took Peter &gt;&gt; the preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together brother? &gt;&gt; And he said now we are waiting for this holiday to go through. Then Peter is gone. He followed the same footprints the same steps where James went and verses. Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing &gt;&gt; of the church unto God for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; For James probably they were reluctant. But when it came to Peter, the church gathered together to do what? &gt;&gt; To pray. &gt;&gt; They were praying without ceasing, they were praying to God about Peter. &gt;&gt; Read one, brother. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between the two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison. &gt;&gt; Imagine brother Peter was not a criminal. &gt;&gt; He was just a believer. &gt;&gt; But they wanted to be sure that Peter is not going to escape. He was put in between soldiers &gt;&gt; and he was like in the inner prison chain binding him. &gt;&gt; I'm sure Peter was saying Lord thy will be done. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. Sometimes a brother is in a situation he can't even pray. &gt;&gt; So he needs your prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray for me and I'll pray for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; So Peter right there in such state the the brothers were at John Mark's place. Now &gt;&gt; you Bible believers Bible readers they were John Mark. What were they doing? Praying without ceasing. &gt;&gt; They said we are not going to go back home. We are going to have an all night prayer &gt;&gt; praying for our precious brother Peter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that that brotherly feeling &gt;&gt; that feeling. &gt;&gt; Pray for your brother. Pray for your sister. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you hear a prayer request, don't put don't take that for granted. &gt;&gt; It's a request. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be honest and pray. &gt;&gt; But the saints were gathered. Pray now. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison, and he saw Peter on the side. It raised him up and said, "Rise up quickly." &gt;&gt; And his chains fell off his head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray. &gt;&gt; Pray without ceasing. Lord, do something about our brother. &gt;&gt; We can't have another funeral of a brother dying in that way. Huh? Enough is enough. Satan, you are defeated. Satan, you are liar. It was serious business. People were not sleeping in that one night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And an angel comes. It was in the night. It comes to Peter Pim says rise up quickly. When he rose up, chains fell. M &gt;&gt; soldiers were still there and asleep. My God. And he says, okay, let's let's read on. And the angel said unto him, get thyself and bind on thy sandles. And so he did. And he said unto him, cast thy garment above thee and follow me. &gt;&gt; Soldiers were still asleep. He was in the in the prison. Yes. &gt;&gt; Peter says, "Dress up. Follow fast. Change them for." He follows the angel. Soldiers asleep. You imagine the doors with their chains. What would happen? Doors would open. &gt;&gt; The angel now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The angel of &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; taking of Peter out of praise the night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what was it? Prayer. &gt;&gt; And he went out and followed him. And whis not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he was he saw a vision even that bit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was too much for him. He thought it's a vision. &gt;&gt; He said, "Is this a vision? Is this reality? Is it a vision?" Huh? And oh my god. Verse the next verse says, "And when they were passed the first and the second one, they came unto the iron gate that led unto the city, which opened to them of his own accord." &gt;&gt; Amen. And they went out and passed on through one street and fought with the angel departed from you. &gt;&gt; So the angel led Peter to familiar grounds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Peter realized &gt;&gt; I'm I'm Oh, this is &gt;&gt; the the the the the brothers. Let me go to the nearest. It was John Mark. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Peter goes to um John Mark's place. Yet that was the venue for the prayer meeting. &gt;&gt; They were praying for Peter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For what? For Peter to be released. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They were praying, Lord, we are praying for a miracle. &gt;&gt; Isn't that so? &gt;&gt; We are praying for a miracle. Lord, do something about our brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter says ah when Peter came to him said now I know of that the Lord had sent his angel and he delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews back let's face and when he considered this thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John who said was Mark where many were gathered together praying &gt;&gt; you see that brother Huh? Let's go on. I want to show you something. And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a dam came to named Ro. &gt;&gt; A sister came. There was a knock at the gate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ro rushes to see who's knocking the gate. Who did he see? Peter. &gt;&gt; I believe this this language that we have. When saw Peter Peter saw, he says shalom. says, "Oh sh How are you? How how is it that you are here?" He said, "No, it's I I would not open the the gate." She goes back. People still praying, praying, praying. He knocks and he pets one of the deacons. He says, "Brother Peter is by the gate there." She said, "What brother?" She Peter says, "No, no, no. Peter's in jail. He steing my breath." &gt;&gt; The Peter is by the gate. I spoke to him. &gt;&gt; She said, "No, no, no. We don't want people that dream. &gt;&gt; Where you praying? &gt;&gt; Let's pray, sister. There's no time to waste." But man of God, brother Peter is by the gate. And when she she knew Peter's voice, she opened to the gate for gladness, but ran in and told how Peter stood before the gate. And they said unto her, &gt;&gt; "Unto sister Rod, &gt;&gt; thou art mad." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, sister Roa was mad. &gt;&gt; Thou art mad, but she constantly affirmed that it was even so. &gt;&gt; She was not disturbed by what was said. &gt;&gt; They said, "Sister, we we don't want people like that. &gt;&gt; You disturbed me in the prayer meeting." She said, "Hey, your prayer has been answered." But Peter is by the gate. Says, "You are mad." said, "I &gt;&gt; brother Peter is by the gate there." &gt;&gt; She did not budge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That same day it is his angel. &gt;&gt; If it was our language, &gt;&gt; they would have said, "Sister, you have seen his &gt;&gt; Theophony." &gt;&gt; She said, "No, &gt;&gt; it is him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what happened? But Peter continued knocking. &gt;&gt; And when they had opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. &gt;&gt; But he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Go show these things unto James and to the brethren." And he departed and went into another place. &gt;&gt; The answer to the prayer was too real. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That the people doubted their prayer. &gt;&gt; They doubted the answer to their prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They said it can't be. It's in the night. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God answers. And when the prayer is answered, sometimes you are overwhelmed by the answer. &gt;&gt; Can can this be? Yes, it can be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God answers prayer when you pray belief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you shall receive. &gt;&gt; And a miracle happened in prison. &gt;&gt; Peter, I believe at that juncture was in a hopeless state. But prayer, &gt;&gt; prayer of believers changes things. &gt;&gt; Amen. I always tell the brothers &gt;&gt; that after you have done praying everything and praying for everything else and before you close your prayer, pray for me. &gt;&gt; Just remember me in that prayer. I know what that means. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I I solicit for brother's prayer. I know what it means. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me brother sister? &gt;&gt; Can I uh show you one quotation and then I think I should close. &gt;&gt; One more quotation. Bear with me. &gt;&gt; 606 09. Be not afraid. And par number 29. Show you something here. There's something very interesting. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Someone said to me, someone said to brother Brana, I believe was last evening say, "Brother Brana, where does this come from?" So this someone who asked, "Brother Brana saw something unusual." He saw something spectacular. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And he says, "Brother, where does this come from? How are you able to go meeting after meeting staying under the anointing? And even one sign made uh uh Jesus weak when the woman touched his garment said I see you stand for hour under that. &gt;&gt; You see that brother &gt;&gt; a question a noble one. Someone asks a prophet how are you doing it? How is it happening week meeting day after day meeting after meeting with the level of the anointing that we see upon? &gt;&gt; How are you managing? Because one woman with a blood issue when she came to Jesus, she touched the hem of his garment and Jesus said vet went out. &gt;&gt; Is that all? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when virtue goes out what happens? You become weak. &gt;&gt; But brothers was asked with this type of an anointing how is it happening? &gt;&gt; Where is what is the secret brother on paragraph number 30 I say I would like to tell you &gt;&gt; here is where it lays. M &gt;&gt; he don't want me to say this but my brother sitting here &gt;&gt; brother Brham is now letting go the secret &gt;&gt; he says yes there is a secret of how I can keep on the anointing &gt;&gt; from day after day meeting after meeting &gt;&gt; here is the secret he then says the brother does not want me to say this but because you've asked me I will tell you he says is uh uh J God that boy don't touch bread or water for days fasting and &gt;&gt; pray uh he he has sent Peter these other brother uh sitting here by you them men lay on their face without food and water when I am in a meeting praying for me. &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. My God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So whatever was happening to brother meeting after meeting it was the result of some prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother God and Taylor when they knew about meetings they would fast. They would pray. Say Lord help our brother William Brandon. Help our prophet give him strength and upon the basis of their prayer. God answers prayer brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very unusual was happening to the prophet. &gt;&gt; What was it? Was his prayer? No. Someone was praying. &gt;&gt; Some brother and he knew. Amen. It's because of brother God and brother Taylor. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wish we had brothers like that. I wish we had sisters like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The success of every church, we must be be best on someone who is praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we as preachers, we wonder how things are happen. Someone is praying. &gt;&gt; Somebody's praying somewhere. &gt;&gt; He says, "Lord, help our preacher. help our pastor. Huh? &gt;&gt; You see things happen, it is because of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So your prayer is very very &gt;&gt; important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't undervalue yourself and undervalue your prayer. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I when I I saw that quotation, &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, help me." &gt;&gt; Amen. That there are people that understands, people that know the power of prayer. Amen. The moment the meetings are announced, brother God and brother Taylor always pray, &gt;&gt; you fast, eat nothing, praying for the meetings, praying for brother and because of that people would wonder where is he getting this strength meeting after meeting as a result of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that? It's important to pray. There's a power behind a believer's prayer. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brother, sister? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You pray for me and I'll pray for you. You pray for me. I'll pray for you. You pray for me and I pray for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, why don't you pray for me? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the burdens are too hard to bear. &gt;&gt; What changes the trajectory? Prayer. &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stop talking too much. &gt;&gt; Let's stop complaining too much. &gt;&gt; Let's stop remembering too much. &gt;&gt; What must we do? &gt;&gt; Pray. &gt;&gt; Pray. &gt;&gt; A praying church is a successful church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Was no matter what the devil did. Remember Jesus Christ said to Peter as I close Simon Simon the devil &gt;&gt; it desire to sift you a sweet &gt;&gt; but what did Jesus do he says but I have prayed for you &gt;&gt; so Peter did not know if Jesus had not prayed for Peter was going to be sifted. &gt;&gt; But prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer is the answer. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; before we hand for that and hand for that, hand for that and hand for that and hand for that. Those things could be all right. But uh brother, &gt;&gt; be on your knees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray. &gt;&gt; When you pray, &gt;&gt; things happen. Ah man. &gt;&gt; I'm sure during the squeeze imagine was squeeze is going is going to come coming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The good part about squeeze is you show what is inside you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not persecution. &gt;&gt; It's squeeze. &gt;&gt; If if you are not sure, if you're not sure whether this is a lemon or an orange, &gt;&gt; what do you do? Get something that is sharp. &gt;&gt; Pierce. Squeeze. &gt;&gt; Something sharp. Pierce. Squeeze. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Squeeze is coming, my brother. When you squeeze, &gt;&gt; something will come out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Taste it. &gt;&gt; If it is sweet, &gt;&gt; it's &gt;&gt; orange. &gt;&gt; If it is sour, &gt;&gt; it's lemon. So will do that. But during that time, how many? When you hear about something happening to someone, brotherh, what do you do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While you're praying, you can hear the knock the police right by your doorstep. We are looking for those people that believe this message nonsense. They've got booklets and all that. They believe in William Brham as their prophet. Uh you say yes you are at the right place I am one of them. She said go to the van quickly to the police camp. You answer your case right at the police camp there. &gt;&gt; This is where barriers will be broken. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All camps will be broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't say I belong to this one. Oh oh oh wait for speed. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You'll be in the same van. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And in the same cell &gt;&gt; and see Christ our redeemer died on the cross. When I see the blood pass over you &gt;&gt; you sing right there and angels will come downh &gt;&gt; and he says during that time what the &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; When everything else will herald we will try and stop everything. But what's the power that is inside the believer? &gt;&gt; You travel like a thought. &gt;&gt; You say I'm going to Kimberly. You don't need no train. Don't need no bus. You don't need no plane. &gt;&gt; Travel like a thought. You're in Kimberly. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say you can't travel unless you have this that that you've got the power. &gt;&gt; You got the power in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Though Satan rag Jesus, &gt;&gt; we cannot be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These things are with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you undervalue yourself. There's a power inside you. It needs to be ignited. &gt;&gt; When certain things happen, it ignites the power. &gt;&gt; Imagine Saint John Mark, they didn't know that they they could pray and God answer immediately. &gt;&gt; Amen. The church gathered, prayed earnestly, and God answered that prayer and down came the angel to rescue Peter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we don't meet on this other side, I I believe on that day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall meet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Never to party &gt;&gt; anymore. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Stay blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You enjoyed that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You enjoyed the word. Amen. The power of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availth much. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you uh dear pastor. &gt;&gt; We really enjoyed that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm sure right now faith is stirred up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Now prayer is something like you know when somebody starts training you can't just train everything in one time &gt;&gt; you start baby steps amen &gt;&gt; so pray is something you go by stage you practice practice practice you pray pray you can never pray enough amen &gt;&gt; that's what the prophet said so it's something that you do all the time &gt;&gt; and therefore when you do it all the time now you have confidence when you pray &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; because it's a relationship &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; you are now talking you communicate ating with God is communication with you and God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as you're communicating with God and if you're doing it all the time, then when you have a need, your brother has a need, you have confidence to go and &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then if you know if you got anything wrong, you make it right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you place your sins under the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you know you can have confidence to go and ask him in prayer. The brother mentioned about Peter being bound there in prison when they bound him with chains. You might have a family member. You might have a loved one bound by spirits, &gt;&gt; bound with spiritual chains, &gt;&gt; by demon powers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Satan's got them bound. &gt;&gt; But what the believers did there, they was praying without ceasing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Instead of you complaining about the loved one, complaining about their family member, go and pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know prayer can move the hand of God. &gt;&gt; We saw it in the life of Hezekiah. &gt;&gt; So if you praying for that family member by faith, Amen. You got to believe when you're praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you believe that as you're praying that bounds the same angel of God, what what what what got the angel of God to go down there? It was prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the same angel of God is here. So as you praying for your loved one, the angel of God can move on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can get the angel of God to go on the scene by your prayer. Amen. And when you pray, God is going to perform paradoxes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Sometime it's unbelievable but it's true. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You won't even believe what's happening but you're praying. Amen. We believe there's power in prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we're going to sing a few songs and we thank you brother for preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not by coincidence you preach this message. My family knows.
